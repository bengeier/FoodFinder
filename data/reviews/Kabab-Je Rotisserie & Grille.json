{"text":"We moved from Michigan and were craving some Arabic food. My husband and I came to eat here but were beyond  disappointed. All the dishes were poorly seasoned and the portion size was tiny compared to the price. We would have gladly paid the price if the food was any good, but this wasn't the case. After a few months many friends have told us that the place had improved tremendously and we just had to give them a try again . So against our better judgment we went back.  The portions have improved but the food was still sub par. The vegetables that came with our entrees were boiled instead of being grilled and included celery.  Kinda tasteless and unappealing.  The variety meat platter was overcooked and all the meat except the chicken was dry as the bottom of a shoe. The only thing that was semi tasty was the salad, that came with the meal. Needless to say we will not be going back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome...one of my & my wife's favorites. The staff is super friendly, the owner treats you like you're in his home & is very hospitable, and the food is amazing & at a great price! My favorite is the meat shawarma sandwich and we never go without taking a container of their garlic sauce home with us. If you're close, you've got to give them a try!"}
{"text":"I've been back a few more times and haven't been disappointed. Anything you get is just amazingly delicious. We usually end up sharing the hummus shawarma, so delicious and I love that it comes with fresh, hot pita. I ordered the pizza, can't remember the name of it, with meat on it. So amazing, shared with my husband and a friend and they both agreed it was fantastic.   Last time I was in I took a few desserts to go to share with friends. They had a salted caramel crème brulee dessert. Wow. Pretty sweet to eat the whole thing by yourself but so delicious that I managed on my own.   This is definitely one of my local favorites!"}
{"text":"Outstanding  atmosphere, service and food. Will come back over and over. You get a lot of food for what you pay for."}
{"text":"We are vegetarians and usually find a good selection to order from. The baklavas are tasty.  The hummus is good as is the pita bread, stuffed grape leaves and Mutabel - (eggplant with tahini). We have also had the veggie platter, spinach pie, tabbouleh and tasted their baklavas. All good.  Did not much care for the Musakka but overall our experience has been great with both dine in and carry out.  Good, friendly service!"}
{"text":"Best hummus in charlotte!! I go there on dates with my fiancé. Sometimes the owner will be there and he comes around and greets everyone! I recommend the lamb kabob"}
{"text":"Wonderful service! Wonderful food...you can find something, even for your picky person out of the family. Food is healthy and yummy."}
{"text":"The food was way better than I expected for a small place.  The staff was friendly & helpful.  I would recommend it especially for a lunch."}
{"text":"I had dinner here this past Saturday evening 10-05-2013, and it was fantastic, by far the best Lebanese food in Charlotte, the service was great and very friendly.  I started with a Fattoush salad to start, then for my entree(actually a hot appetizer) I had the Hummus Shawarma with mixed meat(chicken, beef & lamb) with the home made pita bread and it was delicious.  Finished the dinner with a Lebanese coffee and a pie of Baklava!!!  I grew up in the Detroit area and we had plenty of good Lebanese restaurants, so I knew what I was looking or and this place did not disappoint!!!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good about Kabob-Je.   Everyone from the owner to the dishwasher are above awesome.   The food is spectacular!   And the smells are amazing"}
{"text":"Great food, great wait staff, but my last visit there ruined it for a while. Went on a Friday night around 6:15 (only a party of 4), put our name in, and watched at least five families be seated before us because they knew the owner/manager. These weren't people who had called ahead; the hostess was getting very annoyed with her boss and kept telling him that we were next, no not them, we were there first, etc. He didn't care. It took over an hour to be seated. The hostess was great and again, the wait staff is always on point. But what a way to run a business."}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants in the Charlotte area, the food is amazing i have tried so many things here and introduced friends to it who agree with me.  The lamb and shawarma wraps are the best in the city, the Armenian sausage unfortunately runs out at times but is well worth a trip back to get more."}
{"text":"We discovered this place through YELP today for lunch while in the area for business. It's GREAT! We were so pleased with the wait staff, the owner's visit to our table, and most of all the food was delicious, authentic and plentiful! I tried the Sampler 2 on the appetizer list and it was so good, especially the baba ganoush! We even ordered an extra take-out portion of it. The pita bread is freshly made and to die for! We have this one on our hit list for the next time we are in Matthews area. Keep it open fans, we want to come back!"}
{"text":"Chicken shawarma plate is delicious.  The chicken is seasoned well, the saffron rice has raisins and the roasted vegetables are really tasty. I may like the vegetables as much as I like the chicken. They make their own pita bread. I have been two times and each time my food came fast and service was excellent."}
{"text":"I can't wait until spring hits and I can sit on the patio and enjoy the wonderful food here. I had the Chicken Shawarma sandwich and it was excellent. The rice with cranberries is also awesome and we had a fantastic dessert (something with a light lemon taste and crumb topping). Definitely recommend this place and wish it was closer to Charlotte, I would go more often."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Charlotte!!! Seriously, this place is great. Food is delicious, I haven't tried anything I don't like and I've tried just about everything. Then interior is small and they always pack people in so expect for it to feel a bit crowded. Owner comes around to the tables and checks on the guest. Service is typically an A+, even on busy nights, with all of the servers being attentive, polite, and efficient."}
{"text":"I must admit the food was awesome, the service was even better. The only problem I had was the lack of respect shown from the cook to the servers, I observed  him yelling at them,  and also as I was asking my server questions regarding the food,  the small cook proceeded to constantly call his name until he had to leave me for a few moments  he excused himself,  but what upset me is the fact that the cook saw him speaking to me,  I feel it would have been more appropriate to wait until he had answered all of my questions  and got my order. Still haven't  decided if I will go back."}
{"text":"I am so impressed by the food each time I visit.  My husband and I travel 30 minutes to get here frequently because it is by far the best Mediterranean restaurant in the Charlotte area. Dolmas are fresh, pita homemade and hot, cold olive oil dishes that are just fantastic. Thumbs up, this place gets packed and it is easy to see why.  Service is also always top notch."}
{"text":"Their fresh baked pita bread is to die for.  We always try to eat in because of that.  Their kebabs are always done just right and portions are generous.  We love their lamb and babaganoush (moutabel) but hot appetizers (kibbeh plate in particular) are also on a par with those we used to get in NYC.    Overall, very pleased to find a decent mediterranean restaurant here in Matthews NC.  We will be frequenting this place for sure."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best mediterranean food in Charlotte.  Food is very authentic, and prices are about exactly right.  Can not go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"I moved to Charlotte near the Matthews area a few months ago with my girlfriend. We come from foodie cities (New York and Miami) so we explored the food scene here and are grateful to have this place near our home. Weve been to Kebab Je on several occassions and they never dissappoint. They are consistent with everything they do. The food is fresh and delicious and the service is fantastic. The place is well maintained, the staff are always friendly and I usually see the manager/owner well involved. You can sense passion, love and pride in their food and service. This is a special place and it has made us loyal customers.   -Do try their hummus. it is fresh and you can order \"to go\" to keep at home. Theyll throw in pita bread pieces along with it.  -Their baklavas are a perfect treat to end your meal. its small and tasty and well worth it. my fave is the pistachio baklava.   -Always include pita bread with you meal. they make it fresh, and deliver it while its still warm and puffy. Delish!  We can be very critical of a place, and explored many restaurants in Charlotte but Kebab Je are always on point and we always leave satisfied and happy. I recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"My FAVORITE restaurant! I LOVE EVERYTHING on the menu. The food is DELICIOUS, fresh & flavorful. The staff is excellent. I always take friends & family here & everyone is always impressed. It's very reasonably priced too...ENJOY!!!"}
{"text":"This was a new experience for us and we'll definitely be back. The chicken Kebob is nicely spiced and the beef Kebob was tender, juicy, and also delicious. Our waitress was very helpful and friendly.  Seating is ok, wish they had booths, tho. This restaurant was a nice surprise!"}
{"text":"This place has the very BEST in Mediterranean cuisine!!! The hummus is the best I've ever had and the shawarma is simply amazing!! Sometimes if you go somewhere the food is amazing and on your next visit, you find it subpar. This WILL NOT happen here!! Every visit. Every time. Every dish. These guys hit it out of the park!!"}
{"text":"My family and I have tried many of the appetizers, main dishes and desserts.  We have not found anything that we do not love.  Everything is fresh and so flavorful.  You can watch them pull the pita bread out of the oven before they serve it steaming hot to your table. YUM!  You can tell that they really take pride in the food and in the service."}
{"text":"Incredible hummus and bread, very tasty grape leaves. Beef/lamb shawarma plate for me, chicken for the wife. Both were excellent but I liked the chicken a little better. I'm not a big red meat eater... unless it's bacon :-)  Took baklava, pistachio baklava and date thingy home for dessert. All were excellent. Sat in the back near where the food was picked up. Waiter Mahmoud (sp?) was very attentive and polite. Owner stopped by a couple times also. He apologized if it was too noisy where we sat but we thought it was great. It was like a meal with a show, and we were in the middle.  He keeps his staff on their toes running that restaurant like a well oiled machine.  We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Nice place with nice staff and and the manager was so kind - food was very good with Arabic taste like home from my said where I came from its the best Mediterranean restaurant in USA"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service! Both times I've been, everything tasted fresh and was served  quickly. The $6.95 sandwich and side lunch special is a great deal and will fill you up. But if you go with a group of people, definitely try the hummus or fried cauliflower appetizer."}
{"text":"Everything you read about this restaurant is true.  The food is delicious, the serving size is generous, and the service is excellent.  Our server Raymond was very attentive and happily explained the menu to us as we didn't have much experience with Lebanese cuisine.  If you enjoy Mediterranean food then you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"First time visit. Didn't realize they had been here two years. It's a must try. LOVED the babaconnush. Attractive atmosphere and everyone working was absolutely genuinely friendly. Will be back."}
{"text":"Wow. What a find. .Good job to the owner and the employees.The owner  met us at the door and Brian ( our server ) was excellent. The sauces were not spicy  as warned and loved them with the samosas and lamb was excellent. Overall great food, they fed us like a mother. Love the customer service. I'll have to drive my family from Huntersville  to try out their other foods..Thank you for the hospitality."}
{"text":"Stopped here for Saturday lunch, the place was bustling but not packed. As always the owner was greeting patrons and making sure everyone was well taken care of. He's very hands on and doesn't miss a thing, noticing as soon as our bread basket was empty...and speaking of that heavenly pita, try not to fill yourself up on it (it's addictive) because there is so much to explore on the menu. I can only speak for the vegetarian food but of course there are plenty of meaty options for you carnivorous fiends. The hummus is smooth and creamy and so much tastier than anything you've tried before. Portions are pretty huge and prices are incredibly cheap for what you get. The service is personal and efficient. Overall, this little place is well organized, run with care and attention to detail. And it's yummy."}
{"text":"I recently discovered mediteranean cuisine and I love it. I always look forward to eating here. Their other location Pita Kabob is wonderful as well. Now I have 2 locations within 5 miles. I love the shawarma!"}
{"text":"Awesome Mediterranean food and plenty of it.  Good recommendations by server gal. Mixed grill was perfect and wife loved the seafood grill. Order extra hummus,  delicious :-) Even  the kids loved their pizza. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Straight fireeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee  Vegetarian options all very Authentic.   Brianna was the best :)"}
{"text":"So good!!! Love the Chicken Kebab. The Fried Cauliflower with Tahini is simply amazing. All the food I've tried there--the Spicy Armenian Sausage, the Syrian Chicken, even the Grilled Wings--all delicious. I am looking forward to going there again."}
{"text":"Knowledgeable, attentive staff that helps you understand menu items you may not have tried before. Wonderful fresh ingredients and flavors!  The fried cauliflower appetizer is a must."}
{"text":"I decided to try this restaurant on a whim, as I am always in the area. It stays busy, so if you are wanting to get a to go order, I would call it in on your way. I love the lamb sandwich and that is usually what I have when I go, but everything on the menu looks great. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"For an appetizer, we enjoyed the Falafel Plate.  Pita bread was good as well and we got several refills.  For our meals, I had the mixed grill and my husband had the Shawarma.  We both enjoyed our meals and plan on coming back again!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong here. Even if you just go for the fresh pitas baked in the brick oven! I love Lebanese/middle Eastern food, so this was a treat for me. We took my mother-in-law for her birthday and she wouldn't know shawarma from tabbouleh. However, our waiter was extremely helpful in explaining the dishes and even brought a sample of the meats for us to taste before ordering. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"After many tries I have officially found the best Lebanese restaurant in Charlotte because it really can't get better than this unless you go back in time to my Sittee's (that's grandmother in Lebanese) kitchen. We ordered the Chicken Shawarma, Hummus, Babaganoush, Tabouleh, Falafal and Patata Harra. The fresh made out the oven Syrian bread was beyond what I could have imagined. The taste, texture, temperature, service, environment, music... Kebab-Je in Matthews has it all and make sure you try the authentic imported Shatila desserts like the walnut baklava or rose water rice pudding with pistachios and cinnamon, it was seriously unbelievable..."}
{"text":"After my last 2 visits I have to change form 4 stars to 3. My most recent visit was about a month ago give or take. The food was good except the rice it tasted like minute rice not sure what was up with that? I noticed the deserts have changed and there is really not much to choose from that you can't get anywhere else. The atmosphere has also changed, I guess its the arrangement of tables in such a small place.  I am sure I will give it another try when I am out that way  and hopefully it will be as good as it was when I first posted."}
{"text":"I have been here quite a few times. What a great place. The food is authentic, consistent and delicious. The servers and the owner are extremely friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Since this was our first time and we had only read the glowing reviews we decided to try a little of everything.  I found the the food her bland (lots of salt and pepper only), greasy (for those people with concerns about fats), the veggies cooked to death, the minced chicken kababs rough (lots of chewy fat) and overall totally uninspired by the food here which btw all tasted the same.  Not returning back."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great value!  Simply put...\"this place never disappoints\".  The staff always greets us with a smile and a handshake.  We eat here consistently and never get tired of the food.  Highly recommend this restaurant to everyone."}
{"text":"I grew up in Detroit where they have the largest Middle eastern community outside of the Middle East.  This is my favorite food and I back home I ate it at least once a week so my standards are pretty high. I did not expect the food to be as good as home and understandable it was not however, it is one of the better ME restaurants in the Charlotte area and I would return. I recommend it to friends who have not tried Middle Eastern food before."}
{"text":"The food at Kebab Je is Amazing! It's easy knowing the food is well prepared & the staff is extraordinarily knowledgable and hospitable.   Each time we have arrived, we have been greeted by familiar faces who have come to know our entire family. The food is healthy & delicious. I order pretty much the same thing every time. My children are always excited to eat at Kebab Je! It has been excellent for lunch meetings, family dining & dinner dates with my wife!  As long as I live within driving distance, this will become a regular dining spot for our family.   Also, it is good to know the food is halal!"}
{"text":"The falafel was incredible! Hands down the best homemade pita I've ever had. A must try for Lebanese/ Greek food lovers."}
{"text":"Great job Yelp!  We visited this location because of the reviews.  The appetizers 5 stars:  We tried the Hummus Shawarma, Labneh, and Eggplant El Rahib.  They were awesome.  The fresh bread that came with it was exquisite.  Although on our second visit, the over was down and we didn't have fresh pita bread.  Get a second over because the fresh pita bread is a strong selling point.  The meals went from 3.5-5 stars.  The Kebab was ok.  I would give it 3.5 stars.  The lamb special on the other hand was amazing and deserves a 5.  Unfortunately they don't have that all the time.  We had some of their sandwiches as well and they were around 4 stars.  On average I would give it a 4-4.5 stars, but I bumped it to 5 because they are consistently good."}
{"text":"Fresh, tasty, fresh, affordable, fresh, friendly - It isn't everyday you are greeted at the door by the owner of the restaurant. The customer service was top notch and the food was on point."}
{"text":"Food is great, but service sucks.  I came in for a takeout order and 5 people walked by me before even acknowledging me.  Wish they had better service - would eat here more often!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite restaurant in Matthews. We've been many times, and each time the food has been delicious. We like to take out-of-town friends here, too. Favorite dishes include: the hummus & pita (the pita bread is made in a brick oven which you can see from the dining room -- it's soooo good), the kebabs, tabbouleh and the cauliflower. Yes, cauliflower. :) And don't forget dessert! The pistachio baklava is amazing."}
{"text":"Just moved to Mint Hill and was looking for a place to eat where all the food isn't fried. This place is really excellent; authentic Middle East preparation. Had the mixed grill. My only warning is that the portions are huge, which may be why many diners were leaving with containers. I would strongly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Fantastic food! Ordered the smoked eggplant dip as an appetizer; it was nice and smoky with great roasted garlic flavor- definitely large enough to share! The fresh pitas are so amazing- so fresh watch out for the steam when you tear into it. For the entree I ordered the falafel sandwich and tabbouleh- authentic and delicious. When you order the iced tea- ask for mint and lemon. Prices are so reasonable. Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"2nd time I come here and I appreciate clean good food  I recommended to anyone in mood for middle eastern food this is the place to be"}
{"text":"The food is good and they have items you can purchase by the pound or otherwise in refrigerated cases.  The dining area isn't very large and I was really hoping to try multiple items.  My boyfriend and I ordered sandwiches which were great but they don't come with anything and I was hoping to try the grape leaves, taboulleh, potatoes harra, hummus or falafel but you have to order any of that stuff separately.  There are no free soda refills, if you order soda it comes bottled and it's $1.95 per bottle so be prepared.  I think the menu could be reworked to include a side item with your sandwich choice or you'll spend a fortune buying everything a la carte."}
{"text":"The is the best Mediterranean food in Charlotte!! The lentil soup is excellent, having a perfect constancy and blend of seasonings. The best I've ever tasted. Everything on the menu will delight the pallet and there is a good variety of freshly made items. This is a family owned restaurant, with a friendly atmosphere and great service. There is a counter that allows viewing of the selections including delicious desserts. We try to eat here at least once a week."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic. Fresh and flavorful. Staff is very attentive and prompt. Owner/Manager is site was extremely friendly, courteous and thankful."}
{"text":"We love this place!!  The Kafta Sandwich is outstanding!! Great staff that really takes the time to answer your questions and make suggestions!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I are regulars at this wonderful restaurant and always enjoy a great meal! The owner Yassar, is a warm and gracious host! His staff are very good and always very attentive to our needs. The food is outstanding! Whenever we visit a new restaurant that offers food from another country we always look to see if the clientele are from that country and we've never been disappointed when we see that occurring! This establishment has a very loyal following of folks from the Middle East and Lebanon and now we know why! We are still working our way through the menu and loving it! Everything we have had has been very good! We took my parents, who aren't big on anything different, but went with us and absolutley loved it and are ready to go back!  I would echo the comments regarding dining being tight but hey if the food is good that's a small thing!! We will be back and strongly suggest you give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, extremely generous portions, good company, very attentive service. Pleasant casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food was very good and fairly priced! They need to get a soda fountain. Other than that it was great! Loved my server."}
{"text":"You know how you have things on your to-do list but it takes you forever to do it?  Well I have been meaning to post this forever!  My mom took me here for my birthday last July (2014).  The up side: The food was delicious!!  The down side: one of the cooks dropped an entire spit of lamb on the floor when he was adjusting it.  The thing that happened next is the reason that I have not been back.  They proceed to take it to the back kitchen and not even five minutes later they come back with a new spit of lamb and it's dripping wet!!  I was shocked and disgusted.  I would love to go back because the food was good but I can't get over them just washing off the lamb and bringing it back out.  I'm sorry it's taken me so long to post folks."}
{"text":"Fantastic! We had tabbouleh and smoked eggplant appetizer and they were both awesome! They don't mind giving out generous portions of their table bread.  My husband had the lamb shank and I had the grilled chicken kabab sandwich.  It was way too much food so dinner tomorrow.  For desert we had the date like cookie bar - om!! Only negative was they need more floor space.  The design takes up a lot of valuable real estate that I am sure is costing them money with so much kitchen area."}
{"text":"Great Lebanese food. Awesome service, great hospitality and perfect consistency in their food."}
{"text":"Finally some great ethnic food in matthews!!! Hubby and I love this place.  My favs include their baba ghanoush and their fatoush salad with some kind of schwarma meat.  Their pita bread is the best! It's freshly made :-) hubs loved the sandwiches there.  Don't forget their terrific service."}
{"text":"Seriously delicious.  Enjoyed it for the first time last week, and went back again tonight (on a Monday) hoping it would be as good; but it blew me away.  Our server knew every ingredient on every dish we asked him about.  The food is made in house, super fresh and delicious,  the owner is interacting with the guests, truly, everything you could want.  We ordered the family platter which had a selection of kebabs and sides.  The toon (garlic sauce) was amazing.  5 stars without hesitation!"}
{"text":"One of the best if not the best middle eastern restaurant in Charlotte.  I haven't tasted all their dishes yet but all the ones I had have been scrumptious.  Their desserts are fantastic too. The atmosphere is made even more genuine with the enchanting music of 60-70's Lebanon. Great outdoor patio area for a good-weather day. Servers are friendly and hard working. Prices are fair."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Middle Eastern restaurant I've eaten at so far in the Charlotte area. My family and I ordered the mixed grill family platter. Wow, everything it came with was so good! The lamb was out of this world and the rice with raisins which I normally don't like raisins in anything, was delicious. Also, the grilled veggies were on point! The staff was super friendly and attentive too. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. My favorite is the veggie plate with tabouleh, hummus, falafel, and batata harra. The rice is also very good. Great service. They always treat you like family."}
{"text":"Recently came across this place and ate in once, carried out twice.  First, let me say that I am originally from Detroit where there is a lot of good middle eastern food (definitely a lot of Lebanese).   Not that I'm the world's greatest expert, but this is LEGIT.  Everything we've had is great (esp the kababs) -- but the garlic sauce is ridiculous.  I was surprised at some of the negative reviews here, but noticed most of them seem to be clustered around the time they opened back in July.  Service was attentive, ambiance is pretty plain vanilla: go here for the food, not the romance."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this restaurant!   This restaurant has the best Lebanese food around. And the service is great!  The waiters are very knowledgeable and are very attentive to their customers. By the way, you must try the Hummus and Grape leaves"}
{"text":"Incredible food, absolutely everything is first class. Service is as friendly as it gets. Second time we came our server remembered all five of the name in our family."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. The owner was extremely nice and personable. We ate at Kebab Ji for years and followed the chef here. Best Lamb and lentil soup around. Not one bad thing on menu."}
{"text":"Let me start off by first stating, I've been in the high-end restaurant industry for 19+ years as a waiter, trainer and General Manager. I managed Mangia, a Mediterranean restaurant on Madison Ave., in NYC.  Kabab has, without question, some of the BEST Lebanese and Mediterranean dishes I've had, EVER! The dolmas / dolmades, falafel, cauliflower, fool, lentils and onions and baba-ghanoush where all amazing!  And to make our evening even better than the food... Our waiter, Heny (hope I spelled that right).  He knows the menu like the pros do in high-end establishments. He's attentive, helpful and respectful to his guests needs. There is no doubt we'll be spreading the news about this place and be back... soon!"}
{"text":"Loved loved this restaurant.  Authentic food beautifully prepared. Service was superb."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times and looking forward to many more. The food is flavorful, generous in size and it tastes like home made. In addition the staff is friendly and accommodating. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Coming from the Metro Detroit / Dearborn area, this is as good as it gets for middle eastern Lebanese food."}
{"text":"Awesome and AUTHENTIC. So many people want Americanized food but this is the real deal.  The fattoush is the best salad (think Greek style) I've had in Charlotte. Ever.  If you're new to the cuisine, try the entry level stuff. Chicken shwarma is nice and easy.  We loved it. My husband was raised in a Lebanese family and this place is spot on. My kids love it too but they eat anything.  Sizes are big, prices low (baklava at $1?!). You'll have leftovers you'll want to eat!"}
{"text":"Ate here once. I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was. From the homemade pita with olive oil to the hummus and falafel! Will def go back"}
{"text":"Had lunch here on a Saturday with my hubby and baby girl. Family friendly place, excellent fresh food. and very attentive staff. We had the ground chicken kabob and the lamb shawarma plate. Everything was delicious, including the hummus and pita bread. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Words cannot describe how awesome the food is here. We loved everything we had and their home made pita is the best! This was our first visit and we will be back again soon."}
{"text":"I do not give 5 stars easily.   My wife and I grew up in the Detroit area and frequently visited Greek Town.  Since moving from Michigan in 1989 to Charlotte we have really missed authentic Greek, Mediterranean, and Lebanese food.  This place completely satiated our missing the food in Greek town.  The hummus is the smoothest, tastiest we have ever had. The pita made in the restaurant before your eyes  is piping hot and delicious.  The Kebabs are spiced to perfection.  The most incredible part of the experience however was our waiter Raymond.  Knowledgable, friendly, efficient, attentive, polite even though the restaurant was slammed with patrons.  Raymond's recommendation of the mixed Grill Kebib was spot on.  I hope the owners know what an extraordinary asset Raymond is to their business.  This is a top notch cuisine experience. We live in North Charlotte but will definitely return for the food and the experience."}
{"text":"I've been here many many times and not once has the service or food been anything less then fantastic. I has a Chicken Kabob that was grilled to perfection and seasoned perfectly. The owner took notice of my Girlfriend and I being there and took the time to come over and thank us for returning. Our server was fantastic as well. Overall as always a fantastic experience that I would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Most restaurants I have been to have been excellent so I am not prone to writing reviews just to overstate the obvious. This one -- is terrific! Excellent vegan food that is not just a salad. The waiters are extremely prompt and very well informed (they know that honey is not vegan !)."}
{"text":"The only thing more impressive than the incredible food is the amazing customer service. I'm hard to impress. These guys impress me every time."}
{"text":"Love the place and food. Service is great. Staff is very friendly and well mannered. At weekends it's very busy. We tried mixed grill, minced chicken kabob and da sandwiches. Little bit expensive but still good."}
{"text":"It's located in a very busy shopping center so parking can be a bit tough but it's worth the battle.   We found this restaurant while staying in Charlotte for a few days.   It's a winner.   I had the veggie plate of grape leaves, lemony potatoes, eggplant dip and hummus.  I mentioned to our waitress no pita bread for me as I'm gluten free and she suggested bringing cucumber slices for me to use for dipping.  Everything was sooo good.   My husband had the pita wrap with lamb/beef shawarma and said it was delicious.  Our server was friendly, helpful and very efficient.   Can't wait to get back to Charlotte!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service and great variety.  What prevented a 5 star rating is the lack of sauces, tsziki style, spicy creamy unique sauces crafted by the chef would push the food to it's potential.  The pita is doughy and delicious, but it needs a unique flavorful authentic sauce for dipping.  The shawarma was very very delicious, and the plain greek style sauce served with it was good.  But where are all the flavorful spices and herbs concocted to make sauces for the kabobs, rice, anything you want?  We asked for a house hot sauce and received a standard chili pepper relish. Grilled veggies were delicious, but the mixture of celery, onions and carrots was just too reminiscient of the base for chicken noodle soup.  If I lived around here I would come back.  The outside seating is very relaxing, the staff knowledgable and very sweet.  I would recommend you try it, I've had shawarma many times, the meats here are delicious.  We wanted more of the other things to make the food amazing."}
{"text":"I came here because I was on a falafel kick, but what keeps me coming back is the hummus meat Shawarma (the chicken is fine, but the lamb/beef combo one is where it's at) plate. Totally shareable and everything else- while very flavorful- will pale in comparison. It's a taste I never knew I needed in my life. If you don't it, you are missing out. Anytime I get it, the table next to us is like, \"Oooh, what's that?\" The eggplant dip was very good and so was the Tabbouleh- which we get every time and it is good as a left over when the other salad doesn't hold up as well.   Word of warning, the pita wraps are good, but have a lot of pickles. I like pickles, but it's an intense pickle experience. Get some fresh pita if you order take out. It's negligible in price and you have to ask to get the fresh stuff.   I have also never had bad service here. It get's busy, so if you are coming with a group, be prepared to wait a bit, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant all around. Great menu with a wide variety of appetizers, entrees, and desserts. Love that you can look at the chefs preparing the food and that they have many of their desserts and other food displayed for you to see. By far the best Lebanese food you will get in Charlotte. Friendly staff and great management. I recommend the hummus and pita appetizer, it's the best hummus and pita I have every had! Love the kebabs, meat pies, lentil soup, and basmati rice. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Have eaten at this restaurant 4 times now.  Twice for dinner and twice for lunch.  Menu is the same all day.  Kafta is amazing.  Get it with hummus and salad.  Their hummus is absolutely amazing.  The pita is hot and puffy. The salad comes topped with crispy pita chips.  On two occasions the service was outstanding.(Raymond and Henny) the other two, not so much.  I have also eaten the shwarma, which was excellent. The lamb shanks are to die for.  Can't wait to go back and try more dishes, especially some of the goodies in the display case.  Portions are large, so we also had lunch the next day."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and great service.  Not sure I can summarize all the different things I've ordered that were fantastic, but the shwarma, hummus, chicken sausage and lamb chops should not be missed. It is a bit odd to find a place this delicious deep in the suburbs, but Kabab has perfectly seasoned meats, delicious hummus and wonderful service.  I have yet to try anything that was not at least \"good\", with nearly everything being worthy of their rating. Their Yelp review is now some weird anomaly, this place is great. One of my favorite's in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Wow great stuff!! Once I finally tried it, I was hooked. Everything I've had has been fresh and wonderful. They even have a market area with skewers of lamb, chicken, or steak to take home and cook. Give it a try"}
{"text":"Visited from out of town for the first time tonight.  Food was excellent and freshly made with great service.  Had the hummus, fried cauliflower, and roasted lamb shank.  Great alternative to the chain restaurants for those visiting Matthews and looking for something different."}
{"text":"When you are visiting an area and you see a restaurant with 4.5 stars with 135 reviews you know where to go.   I was not disappointed. There were so many dishes I wanted to try it was hard to decide. I got the moussaka to start and with pita it was wonderful. My main dish was the Spicy Armenian Sausage. I was the typical person who thought spicy meant hot.  In this instance spicy means flavorful. I loved it. I had to stop myself from eating the whole thing.   I look forward to having this as my lunch tomorrow.   Thank you for feeding this out of towner tonight.    Ps. The place was packed and despite it the service was fantastic and the kitchen was fast!  Excellent!!!"}
{"text":"We were seated quickly for a late lunch on a Saturday. Their pita is fresh baked in house, schwarma roasts in the middle of the restaurant behind the counter where you can order fresh flat bread and treats. You must try the falafel and hummus. Best I've had in Charlotte! Quick service. Delicious food. Great stop!"}
{"text":"This place was delicious and the ALL of the staff were awesome! This was my husband's and my first time eating here after hearing great things about it! This was the best hummus I've ever tasted, and the lamb shank was so tender and peel off the bone good! The pita bread was very tasty as well! But not only was the food great, the staff were great too! From the managers to the cooks to the servers, everyone was so attentive and made sure we had a great experience! We will definitely be back and will spread the word about this place!!"}
{"text":"I got here because of the high score reviews on Yelp and was glad I stayed even though for a moment I wanted to go another place that would serve alcohol. The Eggplant El Rahib was superb! It was creamy, light, very tasty, having it with the naan bread which was hot and puffy was a perfect way to start a meal. I ordered beef Kabab in medium rare. The rice and the grilled veggies were spot on but the beef came out well done. I decided to take them as is, instead complaining. When Julia, my waitress passed by my table and asked me how the dish was, I just mentioned the beef was well done. Up to my surprise she immediately turned to the kitchen and asked the cook to grill two more beef kabab for me. This small family restaurant cares for customers and wants to provide the perfect food and great dining experience far beyond some big names. That's why their food was so good. As dessert I ordered Pistachio Baklawa. Again, it was delicious, not overly sweet like other Turkish eateries, buttery, fragrant. I had to buy a few more and carried the Styrofoam container by hand, up and down a few flights and got them to my office in NYC. My coworkers liked them very much and were amazed how a family restaurant in Charlotte could do a classic dessert better than the most of New York's. Thank you, Julia."}
{"text":"the best of the in quality freshness portions aroma amazing bread nothing like it in charlotte nc"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Busy Friday night but service was still great. Highly recommended. Too many appetizers to choose from but there is a combo dinner that you can choose 4. Desserts were also wonderful."}
{"text":"Quiet atmosphere. We went for lunch and it wasn't busy. The lunch staff was very friendly and helpful. The even brought over fresh hot bread. We ordered the kibbeh fried with a side of saffron basmatti rice. The kibbeh comes on a bed of lettuce and tomato, and they are fresh. The rice is fragrant and perfectly cooked. The rice is also plated well, squared with cranberries and golden raisins on top. My husband ate it in a pita. I are it mixed together on the plate. Both ways was delicious. Highly recommend people try this place."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch expecting a walk up, takeout style place. It is actually a full-fledged restaurant.   I asked for a table for one and was seated way in the back away from all other customers. Thankfully my server was friendly.   I ordered the chicken shawarma, and my server recommended the fattoush when I asked for a side salad.    The salad came out very quickly and was fantastic. It was served with a huge side of fluffy pita.   The sandwich was large. The garlic sauce on it was a bit overpowering. It may have been better with a hummus or tzatziki type of sauce. My bill was around $10, and I was able to take half the food home for dinner.   Awesome. I'll be back for dinner to try more meals."}
{"text":"This place keeps on amazing me Don't know where to start -:) Which can be a good thing 1. Well, first and foremost OWNER Yaser can't be more involved and vested in the betterment of this place as well as its growth and more important than anything else OUR SATISFACTION!  2. It's a GREAT FOOD EXPERIENCE story, sometimes I feel I am visiting Lebanon while being in this place  3. Prices are right if not underprice, but Yaser's (Owner) goal is impress with food taste not by Ambiance it seems which seems to be working well so far, and I peeps ally could name so many places that I go only for Ambiance yet the food sucks no doubt but in this place it's all about food, taste and feeling welcome -:) Arabic Hospitality  4. Location is key  5. Nasim the Moroccan Chef behind it all -;) He is a very nice Chef and down to earth and really cares about every single person to be satisfied and have a wonderful eating experience  Keep up the EXCELLENT work ya Chef Nasim   Now to be a fair I have to keep reminding Yaser of the following: 1. Staff more for weekends -:) it can be a pandemonium if you're not there , last time I was there 7/25/15 I was afraid you may get a heart attack because how much you wanted to make sure every single table is served well and Ina  timely fashion and that all are happy !!  2. Lebanese music when you used to play it made this place feel more AUTHENTIC!  3. Few tweaks of ambiance could turn this place to Fine Dining Experience and I'm talking another type of experience that I usually don't look for in Arabic places, but have secrets only seen in Detroit and Cleveland   4. Alcoholic beverages?! Unless religiously can't which is perfectly understandable -:)  LAST BUT NOT LEAST!! In reply to one of the previous review about food falling to the floor and being picked up again to be reserved!! LIAR AND NOT TRUE!! Been here more than 50 times and never seen anything of this sort !! Must be another competing restaurant owner's comment !! Sometimes service was slow and other times receipt inaccuracies or order inaccuracies BUT NOTHING YOU DON'T FIND IN FINEST RESTAURANTS IN Charlotte !! Eat with confidence his place's owner is a very honest person! Simply going through growing pain exactly like Charlotte now -:)  I am a big fan and will always be coming back for the same wonderful experience and Arabic hospitality -:)  Proud of you Kebabje -:) B. Ayoub"}
{"text":"They have the best food here! I've tried so many things and I'm never disappointed. Plus the staff is amazing. They're so friendly and attentive. I go here every time I'm in Matthews. I love the chicken Shawarma especially with the garlic sauce!!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent, the service fine, ... do yourself a treat and try this place out!  One of the best restaurants I've been to in the Charlotte area.  And out-of-towners we take here are very impressed, especially ones familiar with this style of regional cuisine."}
{"text":"Holy hell!!! Food so good you want to close your eyes when you eat it so nothing else distracts you!!! Fabulous, friendly service & reasonably priced!! I am Greek & food is somewhat similar; the lamb falls off the bone! Beautiful rich desserts & BYOB wine & beer, you just pay a small bottle fee!!  Hummus is rich & smooth. I will be back again and again!!!"}
{"text":"Holy Moses is this place unbelievable! We love Mediterranean food and have looked for the perfect restaurant upon moving to Charlotte.  We have found it.  We have been coming here at least once a week for about two months.  Our service is always spot on no matter who our server is.    Our standard order is the hummus, a feta salad with grilled chicken and a falafel plate.  We share it all and snag their amazing salted caramel mousse cups as well.  The food is fresh, flavors are on point and we always leave totally satisfied."}
{"text":"Our whole family loves this place.  The service is warm and friendly and the food is spectacular.  We love the salads, hummus and chicken schwarma!  So glad we stumbled upon Kabab Je Rotisserie and Grill...Fabulous.  We will be back time and again!"}
{"text":"Love it!  Great food and excellent service.  The prices are very reasonable.  The owner is there often and seems very passionate about the food and the overall experience."}
{"text":"Yum!!! Great service and delicious food! Have been many times and never disappointed. Love gluten free options."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! We had heard good things from family members who live nearby and we were in the area and decided to try. Greeted by the owner who was very friendly. Saturday lunch was busy but we were seated within about 10 minutes and ordered right away and our food came out very quickly. We ordered the hummus which was DELICIOUS and smooth, drizzled with olive oil and served with freshly made pita. We also ordered the friend cauliflower, and chicken and lamb Schwarma. Everything was perfect! There is also a deli area that looks like you can get food to take home. Would definitely recommend this place if you love good fresh Mediterranean/Lebanese cuisine."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place last night.  We missed having a good Lebanese restaurant in the area since Aladdin's closed a few years ago and we found our new spot!  The food is very tasty and authentic, and the prices are very reasonable.  We had a selection of appetizers and the mixed platter entree.  Everything was excellent- my husband really enjoyed the kefta and my favorite was the lamb kabob.  There was a great assortment of desserts.  We shared a slice of lemon marscapone cake- heavenly!!  Total for 3 different appetizers, one entree, one dessert, and 2 drinks- under $40!  We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. We went for lunch on Saturday and it was busy and the patio was full but we got a table inside. We had the fried cauliflower, hummus, and the chicken sharma. All were delicious. Everything was fresh. The food came out very quickly and the service was top notch. FYI no beer or wine but our server said you can bring your own."}
{"text":"Appetizers were good. Entrees ok. Tried chicken/beef shawarma and chicken kebab platter. Lack seasoning. Seems like people in Matthews/Charlotte have not tried good Lebanese food/Mediterranean food. Service was efficient."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Ate there twice in 2 weeks, and am always excited to bring friends to try their food. Humus is perfect and pita bread is always fresh and warm. Service is great and owner/manager always checks on the tables. Great food and service!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for a second time for my Birthday. I could eat an entire tray of their stuffed grape leaves! Amazing food, great service and atmosphere. Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"BEST food in Matthews!! This is one of our favorites and we visit weekly. From their Large Feta Salad with Chicken to their hummus. All of their food is amazing!!!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Charlotte! My family loves hitting it up for a post church brunch or weeknight celebration. I've even taken clients there who end up raving about it. As a 90% vegetarian, the menu options are plentiful and varied. The staff is always super attentive. We usually eat mezza style with lots of small plates such as mutabel, fettoush, hummus, tabouleh, and falafel. When we do eat meat, the shawarma is savory and dripping with flavor. The spicy sausage, soujok, is a real treat as well. You won't be disappointed or walk away hungry from here."}
{"text":"Great little place in Matthews. The falafel was very good. The service is very friendly. Had the Armenian sausage sandwich, a definite must try. The pita bread was fresh and warm. The hummus is perfect. Perfect addition to the dining scene in the Matthews area."}
{"text":"Great service and fantastic food.  It started with delicious hummus and great fresh hot pita!  If that were not enough, my falafel sandwich was also very good.  I ended up eating much more than I expected going in but the food was that good.  My wife had the platter with 4 veggie options and enjoyed all of them.   I have other good falafel in the area, but this had the full package.  The warm pita at the start could have been a full meal.  I almost forgot to mention the very attentive service.  A great lunch from start to finish and we have a new place to add to our list of Charlotte-area favorites."}
{"text":"Amazing...worth every star they get!..the pita is made in house and is worth the trip all by itself!  Had all 3 schwarma and I can't pick which I liked better...Hummus too good!"}
{"text":"Worst service. We were never greeted as the host pass by us six times and sat at the table for over 10 mins and again not greeted as the five waiters/ waitresses who passed by. We walked out!!!"}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean food I've had in Charlotte! Service is amazing. Attentive and friendly; it felt like I was visiting someone's home who took pride in serving me his food.   Prices are great.  Tonight's special was LAMB SHANK with almond brown rice and braised vegetables for $10.95. Felt like a high end plate that could've cost $18.   The pick 4 veggie platter, also $10.95, had many options to choose from but our waiter allowed me a choice from the appetizer menu not even in the veggie listing. Very accommodating. The PATATAS HARRAS were perfectly crispy, but light on the garlic. However, do yourself a favor and add a side of GARLIC SAUCE. It is so lemony and amazingly delicious! I could've eaten it plain. It made everything even better. The HUMMUS was smooth and creamy with just the right amount of salt. And the best part is that it comes with a freshly baked poufy pita. The FALAFEL, while a bit softer on the inside than I usually prefer, had great exterior crunch and very good flavor. We also tried the FRIED CAULIFLOWER, which is tossed with tahini and nice, but next time I'll try Tabbouleh or their version of baba ghanoush for a little more flavorful options.  MANAKISH CHEESE AND ZAATAR was interesting and I'm glad I tried it, but it was a bit greasy and limp for my tastes.   I ended the meal with a PISTACHIO BAKLAVA, which is not made in house, but comes from the finest baklava bakery in the US (Shatila). I prefer Shatila's finger baklava, as it has more crunch than typical, but it was still a nice ending to the meal.   I wish that Kabab Je weren't so far from where I live because I'm going to be making the trek for this food often."}
{"text":"Let me just say Baubau ganosh  very smokey and flavourful  10 shawarma was tasty   thanks"}
{"text":"Came for dinner on a Saturday night. Group of 4. It took the server a while you get to us but we were too busy chatting forit to bother us. Appetizers were the kibbe ( yum yum ), batata hara which was superb and a delicious lentil soup that was a meal in itself! We had to ask for bread coz they probably forgot about it. We had the lamb shank that was a huge helping, fall of the bone tender and absolutely scrumptious!!! Definitely coming here again!  I tried the second kebab je.....the batata here there wasn't that great, the potatoes were undercooked. The chicken kebab was a bit dry....."}
{"text":"Can I give this place 10 stars? It's really that good. We had to go to Best Buy and we were hungry & looked up the nearby restaurants. We picked Kebab-Je because we were SO over the same ol' same ol' and the overflowing number of effusively positive reviews of the food & service. We are so glad we did.   First, the service really is stellar. The host/manager asked if it was our first time here, and when he found out, he sent us out complimentary samples of the chicken and beef/lamb shawarma & sauces, then sent us a complimentary plate of hummus with our falafel appetizer! He also did a robot dance for our 4 yo son, who was absolutely delighted by that. Even if the food was awful, the service was so great we'd have come back anyway. Our waitress was also super attentive & on point. Never had to ask for a refill and she brought us a kid cup of water for our son when he finished his juice, again we didn't e even need to ask.   But the food... With every bite we said OMG THIS IS AMAZING. First, the falafel: I didn't know falafel could taste this good. Ditto hummus. The tahini sauce is divine. I ordered the shawarma plate, which was incredible. The basmati rice was saffron yellow with raisins in it, delicate flavor. The grilled vegetables were seasoned with I have no idea what but perfect. My husband got the braised lamb shank and it was falling off the bone, melt in your mouth. He said to tell you all, \"THE HOOK IS OFF HERE!\" As in, it's off the hook delicious. The portions are huge. I was ravenous and couldn't eat half my plate. It's not cheap, but the price is on par with any Applebee's. The food and portions are light years better value than any such boring chain restaurant. This is clearly some nice family's pride and joy and it shows. Eat here. Luxuriate in the foodgasm to follow. It's worth it."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! Our group had meat eaters and vegetarians, we all left there full and happy. Looking forward to going back....SOON!"}
{"text":"Never fails to impress. Good food and good service. Shawarma and hummus are on point. Owner is friendly. Place could stand to be bigger."}
{"text":"It was a nice mediterranean experience. The food was good and the staff was very friendly. I will come back for more and would love to work through the menu."}
{"text":"Excellent lamb! I ordered the special and fell in love with this restaurant. My mom said the beef skewers were the best steak in Charlotte.  I will be a repeat customer!!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. We had the hummus with the fresh baked pita bread for an appetizer and the chicken, lamb and beef. Very fresh and large portions! Batir was an excellent server and was very knowledgable of the cuisine and the owner greeted every table. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I had my first Lebanese food last year in Peachtree City GA at the Beirut and it was AMAZING....this comes close to that.  We stopped by last Saturday and have since visited with other family members on Wednesday.  As some photos show it has a deli type display where you can look at the food and ask questions...and they are very happy to help answer.    On both visits our waiter was Sammy, he is such a nice guy and really helpful in giving information and answering our questions.  Visit one we shared a mixed kabob plate and everything was very tasty, we loved the garlic sauce. :)  We also shared a Fattoush salad which was very tasty and a large serving.  For desert we had a bun/cheese dish served with rose water that was very good I just have no idea what the name was.  Visit 2 we had the feta salad which was good but I liked the Fattoush better.  We again shared the mixed grill kabobs wich again we cooked perfect!  For appetizers we got the Batata Harra which I liked but I wish it wasn't so oily, the first time I ahd these was in GA and they were crispy and almost like they were baked...  We brought my son and his wife, both gave it 5 stars....we all will be back and soon."}
{"text":"One of the better Middle Eastern/Lebanese restaurants I have eaten at outside of the Middle East (grew up there)...."}
{"text":"A+ Middle East / Mediterranean food in a nice, comfortable environment.    Food is great, prices are good, service is great and atmosphere is nice (casual +)."}
{"text":"What a surprise! Beautiful presentation and such a great choice of healthy foods! Loved the cauliflower appetizer and fatoush salad. Many choices for kebabs. Located near Costco, so this will be a go to lunch when we are in the area. We were so full we skipped the deserts but there was a display of pastries that looked amazing.  Outdoor tables as well"}
{"text":"Very good place for the most part. I would give it 4.5 stars as it is a bit too small and can get quite hot inside. The service was very good and the amount of food for the cost is great. I am not a huge fan of eating out but this will be a go to on occasion as they have a very healthy selection which is quite rare. Overall, this is a quality place to eat for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I had the rotisserie chicken and parsley salad. That was the most moist chicken, ever, especially for breast meat! Tender, juicy and flavorful.   The selection of desserts was also great. I devoured a piece of tres leches cake to die for!  K. Great. I'm hungry now, and they're closed until tomorrow! :-("}
{"text":"Amazing, Delicious and so Fresh! The menu is packed with variety, hot & cold appetizers, crunchy and zesty fresh salads, perfect meats and complimentary warm pita. Desserts with med flavors as well as cakes too!"}
{"text":"Well I went in with high expectations for the food and ended up being completely disappointed. My wife and I stopped in for lunch and we started with the grilled chicken wings. The wings were Luke warm and rubbery, my wife ordered the chicken kabob and I had the beef shawarma both were over cooked and dry. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere is nice, the restaurant was also very clean but none of this is enough for us to return. I have enjoyed Lebanese food at other restaurants in the past but this was a let down."}
{"text":"I ordered the mixed grill and I was impressed. The staff here performed exceptionally well even though the restaurant was packed! I highly recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"I give it 4 stars because they have got to do something about their entryway. If more than 2-3 people are waiting on a table, everyone else has to wait outside (not fun when it's inclement weather). The food is exceptional but the waiting area for a table is a HUGE problem. Their servers are awesome, the hostesses not so awesome."}
{"text":"I had lunch here today for the first time.  It was great!   We had the stuffed grape leaves and a salad topped with the chicken shawarma. A nice warm pita was included.  So delicious! There was a huge display of yummy looking foods & tempting desserts.  I will be returning!"}
{"text":"I am so glad I found this place. The food was delicious, the staff was super attentive and friendly. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic ! I've been several times and have never been disappointed with the food or service. My favorites are the hummus , the meat sambousek (pastry with minced beef and lamb with spices), the Schwarma, lentil soup, and the skewers!  They also have a nice patio !"}
{"text":"This is easily the best Lebanese food in the greater charlotte area. Whether lunch or dinner, they always serve you piping hot and fresh pita bread. It is amazing especially dipped in olive oil. Their chicken shawarma sandwich is delicious and super great value for the price. The chicken shawarma meals great too as is the hummus. Beef shawarma salad, chicken kabobs, falafel, grape leaves etc all have been divine. Service is super friendly and fast. It's worth a long drive."}
{"text":"Really great first time experience. I had a craving for Lebanese and this place had great ratings. We enjoyed most of the food. All the staples like lamb, chicken, pita, rice, and hummus were fantastic. Not a fan of the spinach pie. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Really good hummus served with plenty of pita.  And the Lebanese \"pizza\" was a crispy surprise - I'm sure it's the first time I've tasted za'atar.  We split the beef shawarma plate and chose rice instead of potatoes.  The shawarma was tasty and lean even though it had pieces of lardon thrown in (which I picked out) to keep it moist.    For dessert we tried the fig square which was kind of like a less sweet fig newton.  Would go great with coffee but was a little too simple on its own - this being a critique from an American who is used to overly sweet desserts.    Overall though \"loved it.\"  They've only been open since July and I hope they keep going strong because I'll be back to try a falafel sandwich and the mixed grill platter!"}
{"text":"Food is great but don't lie about the wait time. It doesn't take 20 minutes for them to \"wrap food up\"."}
{"text":"We came to the area for an unfortunate reason, but fell into this restaurant. This place was a gem in our crown of thorns. I have an MSG allergy, so I am always leary of new places.  They assured me I was safe, so we decided to try it. We loved it so much, we went back the next night and brought some hummus to a friend, who loved it too. We also got a cooler to bring some back to Jacksonville. I had the same thing both nights,  the veggie plate, where you choose 4 items from 7, I believe.  Our server's, Allison, suggestions were spot on. I enjoyed every bite. My wife tried the Chicken Swarma sandwich and loved it with the pickles, but really wanted more hummus the next night.  Probably the best hummus we've ever had. If you are ever in the area, we highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent vegetarian and vegan option. I had the vegan sampler with my wife. We had 8 different samples in all. I loved the falafel and the grape leaves. The fresh baked bread was terrific. Staff is amazing friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I just had a few minutes to grab a quick lunch on Friday and I knew that this place had opened recently, so I thought that I would give it a try.  Ever since we moved from Montreal, the wife and I have been looking for some decent Lebanese food here in Charlotte. I may have just found the spot.  The place was relatively empty when I walked in just shy of 2 o'clock for a late lunch take away. After quickly scanning the large menu, I decided on 2 sandwiches: the meat schawarma and the chicken shish taouk.  The meat schawarma was made with perfectly seasoned and moist shavings of lamb. The shish taouk was a combo of larger pieces of chicken, a garlic sauce explosion and some tangy, tasty pickles.   I was really satisfied with both sandwiches with a slight nod to the schawarma on this visit. Plenty of desserts and pastries to try here and I will definitely return with the wife. I just hope that this kabob place becomes a popular Matthews location and does very well over time."}
{"text":"We were visiting from out of town and wanted non processed real food for me and my 2 boys. The wait staff was over the top nice and very helpful pointing out what everything on the menu was. Large portions, REAL food that was filled with different flavors that even my ultra picky 8 year old liked. The kabab platters are large enough for you to share with a smaller child. My 14 year old ate the whole beef kabab platter and half of 2 appetizers and a slice of chocolate cake. Next time we come back to Matthews, NC we will eat here again!"}
{"text":"Delicious. Food and service were good. They were very busy which is good for them, but made it a little tight in there. Will definitely return. There are a lot of choices and some desserts that look delightful. Was too full to try any dessert... maybe another time."}
{"text":"Anytime of the day their food, pita bread is freshly made, delicious and tasty. I come back again and again their staff is nice, friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Lebanese is my favorite cuisine because its packed with flavor, fresh and healthy. The problem is rarely anyone in Charlotte does it right!  This place is the best. FRESH made pita that is light. Ground minced lamb kafta and fantastic hummos. Pretty casual spot, so great with family and friends. I hope they open additional locations!!!"}
{"text":"I think Kabab Je could be my new obsession, I can't wait to return to try more menu items!  When I was leaving I saw beautiful, lamb and chicken shawarma on the rotisserie, I kind of wanted to sit back down and order more!  My favorite surprise was the Musakaa, usually I've had it kind of layered and thick, this was served soupy in a bowl with chickpeas.  Yes, please!  And the bread!  Their bread is made to order in a wood fire oven.  I will make the trek just for that heavenly bread!  You can brown bag it!!!  BYOB $10 corking fee for wine/ .50 per beer!"}
{"text":"This place was really good. Visiting relatives and I chose this as the meeting spot. They did a good job of suggesting items for the family members who are less adventurous. The food was spot on. Delicious flavor and prepared well. They don't serve alcohol though so be sure to bring your own and pay a corkage if you want to have it with dinner."}
{"text":"Very good Lebanese style Middle Eastern food! Fantastic tabouli, schwarma, kibee, lentil soup, fresh baked pita bread, hommus, etc.  the owner/manager is very friendly.  Service is great.  It is apparent that the employees are well treated & happy.  Will keep going - regularly!"}
{"text":"The best frigging restaurant in Matthews, hands down, no question. Hand made pitas, hand crafted meats, the absolute best Mediterranean food you can get. I've had almost everything on the menu and loved every single bite. Greatenu  great prices. Please do yourself a favor and get there asap."}
{"text":"Dry chicken kabab again... need kitchen to be more careful. Service and staff are much improved."}
{"text":"As a Lebanese American I have a discerning taste and I have to say this place is great. From the fresh brick oven pita bread to all the food across lamb and chicken was. Fresh and tasty.  A must have dinner."}
{"text":"This place will be a place I visit at least once a month. It was perfect as far as I'm concerned, but typically the food is what does it for me.   The atmosphere is busy and space is a bit tight but in my opinion it's intimate and quaint. The tables are located around where food is prepared, which made me feel like a part of the experience.   The service was wonderful. Our waitress was there when needed, and didn't hover. She was very attentive.   The food was phenomenal! Man, you get so much food for what you pay, and the food tastes so fresh! We got falafel and the fried cauliflower for appetizers. That cauliflower was to die for.   I had the chicken kabob entree for lunch...it came with two big chicken kabobs, basmati rice, and delicious grilled veggies. I also had the pistachio baklava. I thought the size of the baklava would be what I'm used, triangular and about 4 inches in length, but it was a two-bite surprise. It was perfect!  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My husband is Lebanese and we have been missing mom's kibbe, meat pies and tabouli - stumbled across this restaurant.   Great kitchen cooking area right in the middle of the restaurant.  Bread was homemade in the back of the restaurant. Nice touch in the restaurant.  We ordered kibbe, tabouli, meat pies, hummus, grape leaves, kafta, and beef/lamb  schwarma.  It was a lot of food but all wonderful!!  We normally eat our kibbe raw or baked. This kibbe is deep fried. Same with out meet pies. But it was a nice change.   Great service wonderful food - we will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"I have not had Lebanese food this good in over 50 years. Pita bread is to die for. Food is totally authentic. Service as good as it gets. Who would have \"thunk\" that you could find something so great in a Costco center?"}
{"text":"THE ABSOLUTE BEST RESTAURANT!  If you like Arabic food, you will LOVE this place!!!   Service: Always greeted with a smile, prompt service and seating. Even when they are packed, you really never wait too long to be seated.  Food: Lots of great choices of authentic dishes, great portions (always more than enough). I have had the Lamb Shank, Vegetarian Meal, Shawarma over Rice, and plenty more. I have always been completely pleased with everything. They serve fresh, HOT Pita bread at your request.  Its totally awesome.  I recommend this place for every one. Date night, families, entertaining out of town guests.  Restaurant: Clean! Not a super large space, but that adds to the charm. Its so authentic, it is like being submerged in the culture. Management: Always present and genuinely engaged. He will come and talk to you and frequently shakes hands with the majority of customers."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Pita bread and garlic sauce were awesome. Chicken schwarma and Kafta sandwiches were great! It reminded us of middle eastern food in Detroit. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Definitely will be coming again. Great food and atmosphere. Delicious variety of flavors."}
{"text":"I myself am a server here I love my kabab je family we serve the most upstanding dishes it is a pleasure to represent the freshest trending dishes for vegetarian and meat eating residents of one of the most beautiful cities in the states."}
{"text":"My family came in because we received a free appetizer coupon from a local school's fundraising campaign.  The food counter enticed us and we enjoyed the music while waiting to be served. Minced chicken, Chicken and Lamb kabobs were all spectacular!!! The roasted eggplant appetizer, Moutbal, was FRESH and DELICIOUS! It is so wonderful to find good food right around the corner! And so affordable!  I will be recommending this place to all of my friends and definitely encourage anyone to take a chance here. Great service, fantastic food, great pricing and a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"This is a nice, cute restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating. Prices are VERY reasonable and it was fun to try the Zaatar pizza - no sauce or cheese with mild spices and olive oil. Yum!  Near to Sweet Frog (yogurt) and Starbucks.  We had the hummus app, shared the pizza and an entree with a little room for dessert. Lots to choose from including various baklava treats to cakes and cookies."}
{"text":"Service was great, staff was friendly and anticipated our needs. Love the interior - so much to take in - open kitchens and oven so it gets a bit warm inside the restaurant. Lamb wrap was delicious and full-flavored. I could eat their fresh baked pitas and hummus everyday! Beef schwarma was slightly dry but was tasty. Will recommend this place to friends and family. Cant wait to go back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken shawarma plate and it was awesome!  The rice was delicious, and was topped with spiced carrots, cranberries, and rasins. The chicken was plump and juicy, and seasoned nicely to compliment the aromatic quality of the rice.  There was also a hearty serving of fall veggies that were sauteed to perfection.  The shawarma bread and garlic sauce were great for tearing off little pieces and making mini bites with the chicken, and rice. Overall very satisfying to the pallet, and I I liked that I could eat the majority of the meal with my hands.    Very friendly and attentive staff, and will definitely be back soon to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"Have you ever tried Lebanese cuisine? If not you need to and the Kabab-Je Rotisserie & Grill is the place to go! When trying a new cuisine for the first time it's essential to have a knowledgeable and patient server! And we had a truly \"dynamic duo\" of Brianna S. and Henny.   We sat outside, on a beautiful PINEVILLE afternoon and experienced a culinary adventure. While perusing the outside menu, a patron began telling us why we needed to try  Kabab-Je, including a tour of the restaurant. If I didn't know better I might have thought him the owner but when I saw him eat and pay his bill....he was another happy Customer.  We started with 2 apps, the Hummus and Batista Harra (spicy potatoes). The potatoes were sautéed in garlic, coriander and chili...absolutely delicious. But the hummus stole the show! The creamiest hummus to ever past my lips. A slight splash of EVOO and a spring of mint accompanied with fresh baked warm pittas from their oven.  We both opted for a hot sandwich, my Bride chose the Chicken Shawarma and I, the Meat Shawarma sandwich. The chicken was served on a grilled pita with delightfully seasoned chicken with pickle and a flavorful garlic sauce.   My Meat was a combination of lamb/beef on a grilled pita wrapped with tomato, pickle, parsley, onion and tahini sauce. Seasoned perfectly without overpowering the meats flavor.   A word of caution: the portions are generous, so expect to take some home but be assured.....a couple of mouthful's and you want to try everything!  An additional word of caution....don't want to drive to PINEVILLE? A new location will be opening soon in the Stonecrest Shopping Center but I wouldn't hesitate to drive to Concord (from Waxhaw) for food this delicious and service which is .....OUTSTANDING!  What are you waiting for........  **Our second visit was for dinner and was as enjoyable as the first visit! I ordered the Lamb Shank served with a fresh tomato, cilantro and onion sauce. Lamb was slow roasted to fork tender and the sauce a perfect balance to the lamb.The saffron basmati rice was a bit clumpy and short on flavor.   My Bride ordered the Meat Pie (Lahem Bi Ajeen) and didn't care for it's flavor. Began our meal with the hummus and fresh baked pitas.   Our server, Tristan, did a professional job of answering our questions and was inconspicuously attentive on a beautiful Saturday evening. The Service Team\" has got their \"hummus\" together!"}
{"text":"Pedí el especial de langostino y cordero y estaba divino. Después les cuento si estaban sabrosas las hojas de uva rellenas que compré para el almuerzo de mañana."}
{"text":"Great food! Large portions reasonable prices! I make a stop every time I'm in the areas - the pork and chicken salad can feed two for at least a meal And a half"}
{"text":"Outstanding overall restaurant experience. Excellent food, incredible service. Five stars!!  Only recommendation is that the kids meal should have a small chicken kabob with rice. $8 for a little one was steep and no one wants to give their kid chicken nuggets when the kabobs are amazing!"}
{"text":"Nice seating outside.  Friendly and helpful staff.  Enjoyed mixed grill dish.  Tasty and bread was really good.  I don't usually eat Mediterranean but I need to eat more!  Grilled veggies are a favorite and this place had excellent tasting ones."}
{"text":"Lebanese food is one of my very favorites.  We both had the Veg Plate and picked a variety of items, everything was excellent.  My kids opted for the kabobs, which they gobbled up.  If we lived closer this would be a regular stop.  Sadly, we live in Tennessee and will visit when ever we are in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"We were passing through and found this restaurant on Yelp. The bread was fresh and hot and the food was authentic and amazing. The next time we are in the area we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went there to eat today.  Excellent food.  I highly recommend the mixed grill vegetable plate - comes with three kebabs - chicken, beef, lamb.  Service was goos as well.  My only complaint is that we had to drive there from Mooresville.  I recommend one be open in North Charlotte!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love everything about this place. It's a small spot, so unless you call ahead you could be waiting a while, but trust me, it's worth the wait. The staff are all friendly and are happy to answer any questions you may have about the menu.  My big advice is: order something you never thought you'd try. I did when I ordered the Smoked Eggplant appetizer, you can't be let down by the quality of their food. Whether you get the assortment of kebabs, a lumbering lamb shank, a couple meat pies or a falafel sandwich, you really can't go wrong.  Also, HIGHLY recommend their Kanafeh for dessert. You'll eat yourself into a food coma, but it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"Great place!!! Excellent food and service!!! Love it!!!!  Fue una sorpresa agradable encontrar este restaurante de comida mediterránea, creo yo q es muy autentico, la comida es deliciosa!! El servicio es excelente!!! El hummus es una obligación pedirlo!!! Las pitas con q se acompaña son calentadas en un horno especial buenisimooooooo!!! Un 10!!!"}
{"text":"Great place, very friendly staff.  The owner is always there to ensure that it runs smoothly, which is a quality that many restauranteurs  forget once their restaurants take off.  Huge portions, and consistently good. I normally get the chicken shawarma platter. Sometimes the chicken can be a little dry because we often dine late, but it still tastes great. I especially like the falafel and the garlic yogurt sauce. I wish there was a better use of space because the seating is tight and often there is a wait."}
{"text":"Really this is just ok.  The shawarma seems like it is grilled early and left to sit out, lukewarm like barbecue leftovers.  Soujok swimming in oil but without flavor.  Fresh pita is good but mostly because it's rare in these parts.  Not a lot of options in CLT for Lebanese but if you need to scratch that I-need-kebabs itch Kabob-Je will do in a pinch."}
{"text":"Great food ..The owner very friendly and always talking to the costumers to make sure everything is just perfect.  Prices are great and so is the food.."}
{"text":"Came back for Lunch, and was equally impressed today. Was seated quickly, with a small child. I ordered the Spicy Lebanese Salad w/Chicken shawarma.... For $8.95, it was a very generous lunch portion. Honestly could be shared among 2 folks. My wife got the 4-Appetizer extreme, and was happy too.  The pita bread here is freshly baked, which you'll know as soon as you taste it.  The wait staff very helpful w/ordering, and professional.  We were so impressed, we picked up gift certificate for close friends afterwards."}
{"text":"Wow. Just, Wow. The atmosphere, the service, the ownership, the pita bread, the mixed grill, and the baklava were all top notch. This was an absolute experience. If you haven't been here...you have to go. So worth it. Portions are huge so go with the veggie plate, which allows you to get a sampler of appetizers, and then share an entree if you're there with another person. This was OUTSTANDING"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mediterranean food that I have tasted so far in Charlotte. The fresh pita and hummus is delicious and the garlic sauce sets everything over the top! My family got the 12 skewer meal with lamb, chicken, shrimp and salmon! They let you mix and try different skewers. It was more than enough for a family of 6. I also tried the chicken shawarma and Kafta sandwiches and they were very filling. The grilled chicken wings in garlic  were a great addition to the pita, hummus and we also added tabbouleh for appetizers. All of the flavors were very strong and lasting and the food is more than filling! Very family friendly and the veggies are fresh. They have great customer service and were very accommodating. We were too full to try dessert but I took a pic to at least let you see!"}
{"text":"So yeah, the food was good and the portions we're generous but it wasn't 4 or 5 stars good. My dad had the lamb shank. He said that it was nice and tender and flavorful. My boys had the falafel sandwich and spinach pies. They're 4 y/o. They eat any and everything but my hubby tried their falafel and said it was bland. The hubby and I had the chicken shawarma. It was tasty but dry. I had the fattoush salad and was sorely disappointed. The pita is excellent and so is the service. I really wanted to love this place. I drove past Zetounis and Kabob Grill fully expecting 5 stars :("}
{"text":"We were introduced to this restaurant by friends. The line was out the door and the wait was over 25 minutes. The tables are close together it's very loud in the atmosphere is very busy. They don't serve beer but you're allowed to bring in your own beer and they charge you an opening fee. The food was off the hook! The service was pretty good. We're going to go again and I highly recommend you go!"}
{"text":"Ive never had swarma before.  The ones i had here were amazing. They make pitas on site. They come to your table piping hot, great for dipping into the tahini sauce.  I went on friday and again on saturday. Yes its that good. I had the falafel app, beef/lamb swarma, then the chicken the next day. The staff is warm and friendly, and they really know the menu.  I will definitely be going back.  Saw say vegiterian options and carnivore option. They add just enough spice to everything.  Come keep these people in business. Oh they have a nice court yard for sitting out side."}
{"text":"Consistently delicious food and a fun atmosphere - prices are right and employees are professional and friendly"}
{"text":"Love Kabab-Je!   Quality of the food is very good.  Succulent meat (best part of this place) and the veggies are awesome *fresh*.  Great lunch specials.  Generous portions - You get a lot of food for the $.  Will be back again for sure."}
{"text":"Um this meal was on point and it was via Postmates so I bet dine in is even better!  We got lamb and beef kabobs, hummus, falafel, and lentil soup.  Seriously everything was amazing!!!  Kabobs were served with rice and a great veggie medley.  I think I will be ordering in weekly now.  Thanks kabab je"}
{"text":"Great place!  A truly wonderful dining experience each time.  This place is a great example of a restauranteur who understands and is comfortable with their concept.  Kabob Je offers great authentic food true to its ethnic menu  while being approachable to anyone.  Relaxed service from a young but competent staff,  and great open kitchen and moderate pricing.  They keep it simple, consistent and interesting using daily specials.  Do yourself the favor and grab a meal here."}
{"text":"The food was delicious I recommend the the mixed grill kabab. The rice was amazing and the lamb was finger licking good. Definitely a place to go to in charlotte."}
{"text":"Deciding to try this place on one of the hottest days of the year was not my brightest idea as the oven vent pulled all of the air out of the building.  The waitress recommended the shawarma so I decided to give the lamb a try. Probably the best tahini sauce I've ever had. Meat was also delicious, I just wished there was more of it. Prices were reasonable and overall experience was great. I hope they last until the weather gets cooler!"}
{"text":"I would like to try this place again now that I've gotten past the first visit. I was hesitant because I've never heard of the place but my friend who I haven't seen in months wanted to come here to catch up and said the food was good. She's vegetarian and I'm pescatarian so it's always hard to find a place for us. The set up here is cute and quaint almost reminds me of a little cafe. I ordered the scallop entree and she ordered the veggie entree. The scallops were good and the basmati yellow rice was good, however it's almost like they added extra everything to the dish. The zucchini and squash were overbearing and the cranberries in the rice were unnecessary. The kebab itself was great and I would love to try their falafel one day just to try. I feel like now I know how to properly order and maybe one day will come back to give the place a try."}
{"text":"Love the food and the service! Good prices and the owner frequently checks in on our experience :)"}
{"text":"First time not my last time.  We were in the area and hit Yelp to find something good to eat.  We found a restaurant we will put on our go to list.  Great hummus, house made pita, yummy cauliflower.  Our waiter Kelly made our first visit a pleasure."}
{"text":"Their Shawarma is getting bad!! It was so good but it's getting worse every time we buy it! I keep buying it thinking it's just that time but I don't know where they are getting their chicken nowadays!! It's so grey and it tests so weird and bad and smells bad too!! I'm so disappointed because I was enjoying it everytime and kept telling my friends about it! It's not as good anymore, unfortunately! I wish if they will go back to the old one!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I can't keep track of how many times I've eaten here, but since my husband and I went here for the first time, I don't think it's been over two weeks in between our visits.   The pita bread is made in house and almost always comes out warm and crispy. The hummus is also made in house and tastes slightly different every time, but absolutely delicious. I could eat my body weight in their pita bread.   My husband almost always gets the shawarma plate which comes with really delicious meat (lamb and beef), yellow rice and roasted vegetables. The plate is HUGE and could easily be shared. I really enjoy the shawarma sandwich and the garlic sauce is very tasty.   It's easily become our favorite Mediterranean spot."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that if you are looking for fine dining, this is not the place for you. But, if you're looking for outstanding Mediterranean food served piping hot by the nicest wait staff I've come across, you'll love this place. For lunch yesterday my wife and I had lamb kabob sandwich's with spicy potatoes. While the sandwiches were delicious, the potatoes were in a class all their own. They literally exploded with flavor in your mouth. I will never go there again without ordering them. Lastly, whenever he's there, the owner always comes over to your table to see how everything was and to chat for a few minutes. A lovely man. All in all, one of my favorite places to eat in the greater Charlotte area. By the way, unlike most restaurants down here, it is quiet enough at Kabob Je to actually hold a normal conversation. Just another reason to go."}
{"text":"We love coming here every time we come to town, it's always busy but never takes long to get your apps and meal. The food has always been amazing! Don't forget the tabhouleh and fresh baked pitas!"}
{"text":"We happened upon this spot today...pretty unassuming, but some folks coming out told us it was great. So we tried it, and were pleasantly surprised. My hubby and I both had chicken shawarma sandwiches, and they were awesome. Tasty, well-seasoned chicken with creamy, smoky sauce, Lebanese pickles and crunchy lettuce, all wrapped up in a crunchy grilled wrap. The depth of flavor was much more than expected. And each sandwich was just $5.25. There is no side with it, but obviously the charge is reasonable. We also had hummus and pita. The hummus is a good portion, and topped with yummy whole chickpeas, garlic, oil and spices. Our total bill was just over 16 bucks, and well worth it. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Sooo good! I have been here multiple times but am just now reviewing because we had it catered at work today and i got to try multiple items I've never tried before. They have a very nice patio area and the interior is nice as well. Great spot to go with friends or with a significant other.  The chicken and lamb kabobs are very good. I didn't care for the beef kafta. It seemed like it was just ground beef on a skewer. The falafel is very good - crisp on the outside and moist on the inside. The garlic sauce is out of this world. I put it on everything! The pita is good and is great to stuff everything in to make a wrap. The saffron rice is flavorful and my favorite type of rice. The mixed vegetables are really good but the carrots tend to be undercooked which is a disappointment as they are my favorite. The tabbouleh was good to add to my wrap but I probably wouldn't get it alone. I really liked the fattoush salad- comes with pita chips, cucumber, tomato and other stuff- the dressing was really good on this.   If you haven't been here then you should go! Great introduction to authentic Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"1. Great Service 2. Delicious food 3. They have the best Chocolate mousse cake I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Good Lebanese food, fresh salads & good service made it a perfect afternoon for a dine out."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. First time here and it certainly will not be the last.  This is he best I have had in Charlotte. You will not be let down."}
{"text":"Another one of my favorites! The fattoush salad is superb. I usually get the veggie plate with fattoush, falafel, battata harra potatos.  The salted caramel desert there is my favorite caramel concoction to be found anywhere. The Zattar pizza plain with spices is very tasty.  The lamb shank is fall off the bone good.  I have also had the chicken kabab sandwich with pickles and garlic sauce and it is a hit. This place has become increasingly busy and harder to get into at any kind of peak mealtime! The owner truly cares and is so personable. There is a waiter there from Libya who is so amazing with names, service, and so handsome."}
{"text":"Really great food, service and a welcoming atmosphere. The homemade pitas are unbelievable and go great with the hummus"}
{"text":"As you walk into the restaurant, the amazing display of food makes you want to order just about everything.   Deciding on what to order was tough as everything looked to authentic and delicious on the menu.  Everything that we ordered was just amazing, loved loved loved the Albanian sausage, a bit spicy but so flavorful.   The pita bread just keeps coming and is free. Staff were also super friendly as well.   I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"2nd time here! The Hummus with Meat Shwarma is amazing! Customer service was excellent and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have honestly never had much experience with Lebanese or Middle Eastern food so I was pretty excited to try this place when some friends suggested it. It is located inside of a plaza in Matthew that I had never been to before, a pretty nice little area. The restaurant itself was very nice, very clean. It was fairly crowded the night we were there which surprised me as it was a Wednesday night. I ordered the vegetable plate with grape leaves, hummus, moujaddarah and falafel but was brought Moutabal instead. I was sad not to get to eat the falafel but didn't mention it as it really wasn't a big deal. All in all the food was delicious, it was my first experience so I have nothing to compare it to except for the hummus which was amazing! It was so delicious and fresh I could have eaten my weight in hummus easily. Our friends even placed an order to go before leaving. Definately a place worth trying."}
{"text":"Very authentic restaurant with great Middle East food. Friendly and tasty! After long time me and few friends of mine trying to find a good Middle East restaurant in area we was very satisfied and will be back! Thanks."}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten here at this bustling little Mediterranean joint at least twice a month since we discovered it thru Yelp nearly a year ago. It has become one of our favorite Charlotte restaurants and we have yet to be disappointed. Dining is a little tight inside and lines form early so expect a wait if you get there after 6:00 in the evenings.   All of the the food is fresh, flavorful and plentiful. The star of the show is the pita bread made fresh continually in their conspicuous stone oven and is served fluffy and hot! Unlike many other similar restaurants, it is included with most entrees. You will and must add the creamy smooth hummus though which you can buy as a side for around 5 bucks it as part of the four item veggie plate for around $11.   Speaking of the veggie plate, we always order it along with the 3 meat combo at $17. We always choose the hummus, falafel, grape leaves and tubouleh on the veggie plate (all are fabulous) and the kafka, lamb and chicken skewers as our meat choices. The chicken has always been tender and tasty, as has the lamb, which they recommend be served medium rare. Love the yellow rice that is prepared with raisins and sliced sliced carrots, squash, mushrooms, onions and peppers.  We've enjoyed all of the soups (especially the lemon orzo) and salads. The beverage choices are limited however, especially the soft drinks which are canned. The tea is okay. Lastly, the desserts look scrumptious in the display case and are very good but are not made in house and are too pricey for such small servings.   Service is always attentive and knowledgeable of menu choices. Sanitary rating is consistently in the high 90s and Yassar, the appreciative owner, is always on on-site greeting guests and orchestrating his restaurant the way a conductor does a symphony. He is one yet another reason we love this place and will continue to return."}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite place to eat. Vegetarian friendly and fantastic food. There is not a single person on the waitstaff you won't fall in love with."}
{"text":"So damn good! Not only was the food amazing...service was top notch.  Courtney, our server, made sure we were taken care of. Our first time here and it's my new favorite! I had the mixed grill kebabs.  So wonderful and rich..flavor explosion! The portion are immense...you'll be taking some home as well...now desserts!! I'm in heaven! The salted Carmel mousse...is ridiculous! Omg..lol so delightful!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food!  Young wait staff, but they have a good attitude.  There is a meat counter in the back and a deli counter at the front.  I can't wait to stop by and grab some of the deli items to go.  The shawarma (ie gyro, doner kebab), is great!  I tried the mixed grill platter, a warm appetizer, and a cold appetizer last night.  The lunch prices are phenomenal...definitely a great value.  Everything was spot on.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Nice kabobs here.. haven't had anything else NC it always seems like a 50/50 chance I may not like authentic entrees I've never had before but always smells good!"}
{"text":"This place is a five star on so many levels: consistently good quality delicious food, wonderful service, cleanliness, and experience. My husband and I consider this place our favorite restaurant in all of the Charlotte metro area. The staff are exceptionally friendly and caring. The owner is always present and greets every guest personally and frequently visits the tables to make sure everything is satisfactory.   The eggplant el-rahib, foul, and tabouleh are our staple appetizers. The lamb shank entree is to die for. It is flavorful and falls off the bone. The chicken kabob sandwich is also another favorite.   You really can't go wrong with anything here. We catered an event of our wedding weekend from Kabob Je and all of our guests were quite impressed."}
{"text":"Yes 5 stars!!!! They are that good! Everything we ate was flavorful and delicious! From hummus/pita bread, salad and fried cauliflower, to Lamb, Chicken, and Lamb/Beef Kababs on a bed of delicious yellow rice w/veggies!  I mean, seriously ...too good to make sense! A definite \"Visit Again\" spot for sure! Thank You for amazing food  and excellent service! Andrew our server was awesome! My tastebuds and tummy was well pleased."}
{"text":"First time I went here I went during Ramadan and had the lamb shank special which was excellent. The portion was very large for only 10.5 and the meat was tender and flavorful, although mild and spices the lamb itself was tender and flavorful. The service was great as well. I went again last night and the food was pretty average or even bad. The shwarma on the vertical rotisserie looked very tempting so I ordered beef and lamb shawarma entree unfortunately the meat was so dry and tough it was approaching beef jerky texture and dryness. The vegetable medley that comes with it was also extremely bland.  Had to soak it in lemon juice and salt and garlic sauce in order to get the entire meal down. Again the service was excellent so at least they're consistent in that department but I doubt I will go back given that shawarma is my favorite Middle Eastern food and theirs is horrible.  I have now been here several more times and the food and service has been above average. That is why I am raising my review from 2 stars to 4 stars. Overall I suggest going there other than ramadan buffet."}
{"text":"Alejandro told me about this place, then POPROCK LOVE told me She LOVED it, and if George R. could give this place 4 yelp stars I knew I was in for a treat!  Al Franchesica Dinning on the Patio it was raining so it was quite Romantik a Beautiful Night and they have Big Umbrellas from FrontGate (I'm guessing) so we did not  get wet, from Rain, POPROCK Exploded the Cork off the Wine Bottle ($10.00) fee per bottle (no Liquor License which I think is Brilliant)!  AL frissco Dinning on the Front Porch (they Frisked me) They Found Nothing!  Enjoyable Experience eating at Sidewalk Tables, overlooking a Fountain... reminded me of France, though only in Movies (I have never been).  Service was Top Notch!  We ordered about three rounds of Food which I LOVE to do that way you have time to decide if you want more and it allows for a longer more timed (untimed) experience and we wanted to talk and spend time with our friends.  Even though it was Saturday Evening we never felt Rushed by Staff  Food NOT Sweet, nor Spicy, nor Greasy, nor Sour!  This is not GoldenWok, this is Flavorful!  You will probably not get hungry in 30 minutes much less several hours!  Kabab    Two Men and Two Ladies go to a Restaurant with Kabab as the First Word in the Title of this establishment and order Everything BUT Kebab...  Oh, that was us!  Though it was not intentional, went ordered Vegetarian except for one side of Armenian Sausage and a Small Meat Pie (Lebanese) if this were a Turkish Restaurant it would have been a Pide or Pizza if North American  Stuffed Grape Leaves    BEST I ever aTt (ate, if it were Charlotte)  Baba Ghanlouj    very Good  Tabbouleh   Very VERY Good  Falafel    very good  Moussaka   most unique version of this dish  Fried Cauliflower   Popular with ALL except RodO, still Good  Bread     Made in House  Next time we will order ALL Meat and Ever Kabab they have!"}
{"text":"Very clean and bright. I enjoyed the shawarma but I feel like it could have been more flavorful. The lamb sandwich was better for sure! I did enjoy the free pita they give you just wished they would have given you some dipping sauce or hummus with it."}
{"text":"Kabab Je is by far my favorite restaurant in Charlotte. You won't find food like it anywhere else in the area. The staff is super friendly and knows the menu really well. The manager is truly one of a kind. He is always walking around checking on tables and making sure everyone is satisfied.   I am absolutely in love with the food. The hummus is truly one of a kind. Amongst my other favorite appetizers include the grape leaves, the sausage and the chicken wings. The sauce on the wings is the perfect blend of lemon and garlic.  The chicken shawarma sandwiches are great! I also love the kabobs. I never know which kabobs I want so I always get the mixed grill which allows me to get a chicken, lamb and a kafta kabob. The kabobs go great with a side of the spicy potatoes.   When it comes to price, you can't beat this place. The portions and taste are well worth the prices. I'm not sure why some of these other reviews say the food is overpriced. I guess they're just used to McDonald's dollar menu. That says a lot about their taste in food.    If you want authentic Lebanese food in Charlotte, this is the place to go! Trust me, I'm Lebanese and this place is as legit as it gets. I personally love sitting outside enjoying this great weather. If you're new to the cuisine or grew up on this food, trust me, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Try the grilled platter and spicy sausage you well not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Totally addicted to this place!!!! The food is always great and the service is terrific.  For an appetizer try the veggie plate, it's listed as an entree but works for a great app for two or more people, plenty to share and gives everyone a taste of this wonderful Mediterranean Cuisine."}
{"text":"The best Lebanese, Mediterranean food I have ever eaten!!   Lovely dessert menu. You can see chefs in back efficiently putting orders together.  The waiter was helpful with our choices. Lentil soup, hummus with chicken, fresh pita bread, feta salad with lamb, gyro and lamb shank lunch special all very well presented and prepared.  The waiter raised the bar from good place to eat to memorable experience.    Brought desserts home as too full at end of meal.  They look delicious!"}
{"text":"Really good food, good prices and portions. Service is good in my opinion it only lacks a little bit of \"kick\" a little bit more of authenticity. But overall great place."}
{"text":"This. Place. Is. Amazing. Pure & simply, the best Lebanese joint in town, if not the state. Their hummus is smooth & delicious, the falafel crisp & tender, the meat pizza pie is out-of-this-world, and the stuffed grape leaves - oh myyyyyy! There is not a bad dish to be had here. The service, in my experience, is always exceptional. I live pretty far from this restaurant, but it is totally worth the drive, every time!"}
{"text":"Bed customer service.  Real hard old pita was served at 9 pm.  Waitresses never come back to check on us.  After almost done with my food and then they gave me new soft pita.  I will never come back."}
{"text":"Everything about this restaurant was fantastic. Our server, Ray, was very attentive and gave great descriptions of items on the menu. The atmosphere was nice and the restaurant was very clean. The hummus is the best I've ever had. I also really enjoyed the falafel. My husband and I really liked the chicken kafta and lamb skewers. For dessert, we got the tiramisu and baklava which were delicious. For a more traditional Lebanese dessert, definitely try the Kanafeh! I would recommend this restaurant to everyone I know and will definitely come back again next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I am vegan and absolutely love this place. The falafel plate/sandwich, batata hara, and smoke eggplant dip are my favorite! Excellent customer service as well."}
{"text":"Best middle eastern food on the east coast!  I don't usually comment on Yelp, but this place stood out. Everything from the food to the atmosphere to the owner to the cleanliness of the restaurant was a great experience! Staff was very knowledgeable about the menu. Owner stopped by multiple times to make sure we were fully satisfied and ask if we had any questions.   I really love the soujouk for an appetizer and kafta for my entree. The lamb is to die for! Prices are very affordable. The amount of food and high quality of the food is WELL ABOVE what they charge you! ...not to mention how healthy it all is! This is without a doubt one of my favorite parts in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I guess now they're ready for prime time.  I've eaten at this location a few times since they first opened up and results have been uneven but I think they've worked out the kinks.   I tried the falafel twice and it was the tastiest I've had in this city, by far. The shwarma with hummus ($8.50) is excellent, I ordered it with a combination of both chicken and beef-lamb shwarma on it, both meats were tasty and moist the humus was primo and there was more food that I could eat.    Henny the waiter was professional and personable both, a nice change of pace  from the typically friendly but clueless service we see so much of today.  btw they open every day of the week"}
{"text":"We are very happy to have an authentic Lebanese restaurant in the neighborhood. The chicken and the falafel are well prepared and very filing. The food is displayed in cases and the hostess will happily give you a tour. The sandwiches are prepared with 100% creamed garlic and often have parsley, vinegar pickle, or fried potato. The fruit and desserts are also on display and include two different baclawa. They have a gas oven which produces a wonderful Lebanese pizza like bread topped with sesame seeds and spices.  The staff appear to be either family or newly hired and try to be very helpful. We hope they are successful here in Matthews."}
{"text":"I'm not sure I remember any of the names of the food we ordered but I can tell you everything was delicious. The service is superb. I wish I could I remember our  server's name but really everyone was so kind and pleasant that I just had the best experience at this little restaurant. I definitely recommended it. They even made me a smiley face pita bread =) Amazing food and the best service."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now, and it is quickly turning into one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. The menu is reasonably priced, the service is super-friendly, and the food is Delicious (with a capital D). The falafels are probably the best I've ever had, and the hummus tastes light and creamy. Plus they have a beautiful selection of baklavas to finish off your dining experience."}
{"text":"Kabab-Je has some of the best Mediterranean food I've ever had.  We love the hummus with fresh made pita bread.  The mixed grill (kafta, lamb, chicken kabob) is a great option."}
{"text":"Just when I'd started making my won great falafel we decided to visit Kabab Je Rotisserie for lunch. I have three requirements for a fantastic meal out 1) The food is hot and fresh 2) The place is clean 3) The service is good.  I felt like all three of these were addressed wonderfully on Saturday.   The waiter was great, he answered my questions about our food with a lot of enthusiasm. The place was clean and bright - an open kitchen is not an easy thing to pull off but go to watch your pita being freshly baked.   Really though - the food was the real spotlight for me. Everything we had which consisted of the Mixed Grill and a Vegetable plate was spot on. Everything had a brightness to it - a truly magical zing - the flavors were so fantastic. I enjoyed the hummus so much that when the waiter walked away I stuck my finger in the bowl to get the last dollop. Also the falafel was flavored very nicely and fried to a crunchy fluffy perfection. We do have plans to return soon and try the rest of the dishes on the menu.  Recommended to diners that want to try something different without feeling they are out of their comfort zone and people who just enjoy a really good meal."}
{"text":"Great food served in epic portions. The menu was overseen by the owner who himself is Lebanese. The value is off the charts. There is however no alcohol so bring a bottle of wine and expect a small corking fee ($10). Meat that good is begging for a nice bold Red Wine.   Don't miss the moutabel (baba  ganush), fried cauliflower and the fresh, baked in house bread!!"}
{"text":"This place is the best middle eastern restaurant in Charlotte without a doubt. The bakery in the middle of the restaurant  with their food display is amazing. You know the food will be amazing when you have a lot of middle eastern people eating there.  We ordered a bunch of things. warm grape leaves, baba ghanouj, zatar, mixed grill and a cauliflower sandwich. The baba ghanouj  was just fantastic. I really could taste the smoke inside it. They served this with a huge freshly made whole pita bread. Gosh I dont think I have ever eaten pita bread that tasted better! The grape leaves were great. Quite a different flavor from the other places where i have eaten grape leaves. It had this pickled taste. Zatar was ok. But we had too much food and took most of the zatar home. Mixed grill was great. The side of rice and vegetables was sublime. I have no idea how they made the  veggies taste that good. Cauliflower sandwich was ok. I just wanted to try something different and ordered it. I would think the falafel would be better for vegetarians.   The service was crazy good. The waiter was super attentive and seemed to genuinely want to make ur meal super pleasant.  Cant wait to go back and try more things on the menu."}
{"text":"We were actually one of kabab's first customers when they first opened. Back then the food was great as well as the service. Unfortunately, as time has gone on, we have noticed a decline in the service. When the owner is present, everything runs smoothly and everyone is friendly. But when the owner is away, then service is lack luster. It's the typical \"when the cat's away\" scenario. It's sad because I know that the owner needs time off as well, but I don't like to go unless the owner is there."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I've tried several items in the menu and have enjoyed them all. I highly recommend Kabab."}
{"text":"Fresh, delicious, and wholesome food for a fair price. I love a five star steak house as much as the next guy, but this place is one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte."}
{"text":"The service here is awful!    They messed up our order 3 times while I was dining with friends and family.   The food is lacking flavor.   Sure the pita oven draws people in and it's great bread but the meat dishes are awful.     My kebabs... All three were burnt and dry.   The server was aloof,  and the food in the counter looks like they dumped it out of a can.   I tried the tourshe,  and it was gross.     I won't be coming back.   I prefer flavor and quality more than anything.   Prices are way off.... By at least 2$ a dish.     There was no follow up from the server after the 3 mistakes,  which makes me not want to come back ever.   I'm happy to eat elsewhere.   Unfortunately true Mediterranean is not here at this place and needs major revamping."}
{"text":"By far my favorite place to eat in Matthews!  The best Lebanese food I've had (since going to my Lebanese friend's parent house for dinner). We stumbled upon this place after some shopping and what a great find!  They always have a crowd and I understand why....it's good.  I sit outside in the heat but the awesome staff keeps you well hydrated with their attentive friendly service and there is usually no wait.  The decor inside is cozy with a case in front showing all of the meats and desserts ....odd but forgivable.  One of my favorite appetizers is the cauliflower.  It's fried but simple and delicious.  Their hummus is super creamy and tasty.  I usually opt for the veggie platter which is 4 samples of their veggie dishes.  All are rock stars.  The lamb sausage is insanely good but honestly my absolute favorite is the smoked eggplant and a side of extra garlic...yup garlic!  It is whipped into a magically delicious creme that is out of this world.  I mean I have gone out of the way to get this simple but delicious food.  It's good.  Keep it up!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is my favorite Lebanese restaurant in Charlotte! The food and service are awesome. The owner comes to your table and personally asks how everything is. I would rate it a 6 if I could! I enjoy the mixed grill as I love all the meats they serve and it's hard to choose just one! Also try the deserts. It all is excellent here! A must try!!!"}
{"text":"Possibly the best middle eastern resto in clt.  Loved everything we tried - Kafta, freshly baked bread, baba ganoush, falafel, kabobs, fattoush and their desserts.  The hot fluffy bread with their baba ganoush is a great combination.  Service is great as well"}
{"text":"Great food. Best Middle Eastern food in all of Charlotte. They should consider making another location if they can afford it. More people should know about it!  Their servers are always extremely knowledgeable, kind, humble, and generous. Service is outstanding.  I've tried so many platters, sides, and appetizers and I've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"One of the best middle eastern/mediterranean food in the area. Their fresh/hot pita is a must. Upscale ambiance!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! To start the people who work here are the nicest.  I left my phone on the table and one of the guys ran us down in the parking lot to return it.  The food is down right amazing, I can't say the names of most of it but it was wonderful.  As a vegetarian I'm happy when I can plate full of goods!! The pita bread is so fresh and made right there as you watch.  I got the vegetarian plate where you pick 4 items from a list of 8.  You can't go wrong with any of them.  I will be back for sure next time I'm in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"The bread!!   I could stop there with my 5-star review, but I need to give more bread adjectives. Light, fluffy, bread pillows came out of the oven right across from where we were sitting. I've only ever had pita with hummus, so this was new to me... and now I'll never go back to stupid pita. Our waiter told us the bread is so light that he's actually seen it lift up in the oven!   My coworkers and I went for lunch, and it's good thing we got there a little before noon. We pressed our noses to the glass cases as we walked through the restaurant to be seated - good thing the desserts were on the opposite side. Most of the seating is tables up to 4 seats, but we were able to snag the 5-seat table in the back.   We started with the BREAD and hummus, which was fantastic... probably the best I've had in Charlotte. For lunch, I got the Mixed Grill, which was a lamb kebab, beef kebab, and chicken kebab, and I swapped out the rice for a falafel upcharge. They accidentally brought me the rice, which was awesome since it was light and sweet (cranberries and carrots on top). The grilled veggies were okay, but I was much more focused on the meat, falafel, and rice.  it's a good thing I don't live closer to Matthews, or this could become a problem."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The food is fresh and delicious and we probably get take out at least 2 times a week. Only downside is the service is a bit slow when eating in the restaurant. But otherwise can't complain."}
{"text":"One of the best, if not THE best, Mediterranean restaurants around. Defiantly the best in Matthews, NC! The pita's are absolutely fantastic! If you catch it in the evening sometimes you will even get them absolutely freshly made... the IS the best. mmmm The meat shawarma sandwich... oh my. This is one delicious reasonably priced meal in-and-of itself! It is also an easy meal to take with you on the go but will also fill you up.  The hummus at this place is fantastic! Meal by itself on a cheat night. :-) I have yet to have anything here that is not worth coming back for many times over.  Even the baklava!  Do yourself a flavor and stop by the wonderful place tucked in a nice space near Lowes and Best Buy in Matthews!"}
{"text":"Always great kabob.  Very friendly and attentive staff.    Great place if you're going low-carb."}
{"text":"I loved it. Best mix grill ever. Great experience.  I would recommended to any one. The service was fast. We did not have to wait long for a table. Best of all was the fresh pita bread that comes out from the open oven. You must try that with Hommos. Also the taboula was amazing."}
{"text":"The food is legit! We had the cucumber yogurt and it was wonderful. No watery, American style yogurt here. It's the thick and creamy stuff you get abroad. Flavored with fresh dill and mint! Refreshing and a great \"table sauce\" for most of the dishes on the menu.   The rest of the food is fresh also. You can watch them make most things if you sit inside. However, the outdoor seating is my preference (on cooler days). There's a nice view of the fountain, which is nice for a walk around after you finish eating.   We didn't try the desserts this trip, but they looked very good. I know good baklava so I'm going to put it to the test next visit."}
{"text":"Grilled chicken entrees plus the lentil & rice w/fried onions and the fried cauliflower apps are terrific!  The food is tasty and flavorful....This is a great, healthy alternative when you need a change of pace from the standard fare of pizza, burgers, subs, etc."}
{"text":"This place is one of our favorites. There are plenty of choices from the wonderful fried cauliflower appetizer and shwarma sandwich to a mixed grill entree. We're never disappointed.  The service is speedy and attentive. My water is never empty and the fesh bread is hot and plentiful. We always leave with full bellies without emptying our wallet."}
{"text":"I arrived ready to eat! I eat a lot of Lebanese food in the Detroit suburbs so I am spoiled. I ordered the chicken schwarma and veggies, the fried cauliflower as well as the Moutabal (smoked eggplant). Having eaten a lot of Lebanese food over the years from east to west, north to south, I have an insatiable craving for certain flavor combinations and spices typically used. I found the food a little flat for my liking.  I was disappointed that the chicken was dry, the veggies were swimming in soup as if the grill was not attended to and they put a lid over warm grill top to steam the veggies. Expecting the cauliflower to pop in my mouth (spices and how its prepared), but instead it was chewy and tasteless, so I asked for more yogurt and garlic sauce to liven it up a bit. The smoked eggplant was good with good smoke flavor and the pita was fresh and warm. I believe these folks may have had a rough evening, it was packed and the waitstaff were hustling around quickly. If you ever make it to Michigan, try LaMarsa in Farmington Hills, Pita Cafe in Oakpart and everywhere in Dearborn."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! What a cute little restaurant.  The food is amazing. Everything is made in house and authentic.  The chicken kababs are delicious. The prices are cheap and their pistachio baklava is to die for. I will definitely be going here agin."}
{"text":"Doesnt get any better. Wife is from Detroit the middle eastern capital and we both rave about food. We go about 3 times a month. It has gotten much busier in recent months.  I recommend the fatoush fof starters lamb kabob( and i am normally not a lamb person) with basmati rice and veggies. The steaming hot pita with garlic spread is incredible."}
{"text":"Amazing Food! Amazing customer service friendly staff all around working hard! They had a line to sit down and eat but it was worth the wait! We will definitely stop by again when were in town. Visiting from California."}
{"text":"Authentic lebanese food! The bread is always fresh, and my favorites are the kibbeh, the samousek and the fresh yoghurt - the real deal!"}
{"text":"I ordered the deep fried cauliflower app and it was good. My entree was the vegetarian plate with hummus and falafels, good. Ordered the tuxedo cake to-go and it was gross! Hard and stale!!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't review Kabab Je. Maybe because we've been there many times already as it is one of our favorite restaurants in Charlotte. With that said, 5 stars is heavily weighted! Here is why its our favorite. The food is fresh and delicious!! The prices are reasonable to afford us to go at least once a week. I tried Kabab Je from a friend recommendation. My friend Jeff and I always talk about food and we recommend places to each other. Since then I have recommended and taken many of my friends to Kabab Je. The owner Yassar makes you feel at home when you walk in the door. His staff is so courteous and polite. Everything is so good. Our favorites are falafel, hummus, pickles, spicy house salad, grape leaves, tabouleh salad, lentil soup and of course their puff pitas! Some of their desserts are flown in. They are busy for a reason. Go there, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Three of us went to Kabob Je today for lunch.  We had a selection of pickled vegetables as an appetizer.  For our main course, we had 3 different shawarma sandwiches, chicken, meat (lamb/beef), and falafel.  All of our meals were good.  Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Mediterranean food in the Charlotte area.  Ordered the Fried Cauliflower, Hummus, and Mixed Grille.  All were a real hit.  We were greeted at the door by the owner with a handshake.  When's the last time that happened?  The place was packed, a good sign, but we were quickly seated with prompt and attentive service.  The Hummus was on par with the best I've ever had, and the Mixed Grille was sadly more than I could finish.  Huge portion and priced about right.  We will definitely be back!  FIVE STARS!!!"}
{"text":"I've been there 3 or 4 times so far and it's my go to spot when we go out to lunch.  Nice service and great food.  The only downfall is it does get busy and I know they do take reservations for lunch, which is a plus, well not if you're doing a spur of the moment type thing.  It's all good!  Especially the grilled veggies!  YUMMO"}
{"text":"Awesome food !! Great prices !! Service was adequate. The restaurant itself is small but the food was worth it!!"}
{"text":"This make the third time in the last three weeks I have been seated and as of right no waiter has shown up to even take a drink order. I have walked out the other two time. I'm going to hang around and just see how long it takes this time. I have been coming here for over a year and have brought them business.  I eat here at least once a week but that is about to come to an end. It's a shame because the food is great.  Been waiting now for 28 minutes so far and counting.  I was able to speak to the owner and this has been resolved.  I have his personal number to call and or text should this happen again.  He is a very nice and very professional in addressing the issue.  I have changed my rating.  I must say that I'm very happy to have this resolved because the food here is fantastic and the deserts are to die for."}
{"text":"Wow!  This was a great find.  Stopped in here the other day while out shopping and was pleasantly surprised.    I had the falafel appetizer and the kafta wrap.  SO GOOD.  Service was a little odd but nothing to worry about.  I even got a to-go order of grape leaf wraps - FANTASTIC.    You will LOVE this place if you like Middle Eastern food.  Definitely pop in for lunch!  :-D"}
{"text":"It's about time & these fine people do it with flair. Fair priced  & plentiful, will definitely visit again & again."}
{"text":"My only reason for driving from Hickory to Matthews, was to have lunch at Kabab-Je. This would be my first foray into the world of Lebanese food.   My server, Mr. Hunt, pushed expensive menu items. He neglected to mention the many reasonably priced daily specials.   Later, while I was eating, I heard another member of their waitstaff describe their specials in great detail to an adjacent table. There was one special that day including hummus, mixed lamb and beef shawarma, and vegetables for $8.95, which was EXACTLY what I wanted. I almost lost my appetite. SMH! Hearing about their many reasonably prices daily specials that weren't offered to me, made me displeased.   MOUTABAL APPETIZER, $5.50, 1/5. Taste: Tahini & Lemon. PITA BREAD, 2/5. Taste: Nothing. Unsalted. LAMB SHANK, $13.95, 3/5. Texture: Tender. Taste: Nada.  STEAMED VEGGIES: 0/5. Taste: No seasoning, so no taste. Bland.  SAFFRON RICE: 3/5. Taste: It's sad when the rice is the most flavorful thing on the table. DRINKS: 20 oz. bottled Coke. 2 x $1.95 = $3.90.  The primary reason for the low scores was because - NOTHING WAS SEASONED! Nothing, zip, nada, not even salt and pepper was used to prepare dishes. How does one serve a middle eastern dish, the home of bazaars and the world's spice trade, without one iota of spice, salt, or pepper? An African American auntie from the deep South could teach their chefs a thing or two about seasoning food.   SANITATION: 96.5%. https://public.cdpehs.com/NCENVPBL/INSPECTION/ShowESTABLISHMENTPage.aspx?ESTABLISHMENT=129772&esttst_cty=60  BILL: $25.27. After tip: $32.00+. This was about twice what I wanted to spend for lunch. Totally not worth the price - or the drive to Matthews."}
{"text":"Amazing!! Seriously everything my friends and I got here was so wonderful, fresh and delicious. I got a salad with chicken on it and it was HUGE and so freakin good oh man the big chunks of feta in it were heavenly. The service was great too! Wish I lived closer to this place...what a fantastic restaurant."}
{"text":"Let's start with great service! The hosts and wait staff are beyond friendly. This always makes an experience better when you're going to eat out. Food is AH-MAY-ZING!!! If you're looking for fresh, delicious, well prepared, flavorful  Lebanese/Middle Eastern food this is the spot! I don't have a favorite dish cause I'm always switching it up, but any lunch wrap is divine. They don't skimp on loading that sucker up with meat and veggies! Everything is fresh and yummy. You should go!"}
{"text":"I like the food and I even had my teams luncheon here before. Unfortunately today I came in contact with the owner. He asked us to step outside and clean our shoes since we were dragging some straw from my sons soccer game. I appreciate his desire for cleanliness in his restaurant but I took insult to it. I expressed my disappointment in his request, This resulted in him asking us to clean the mat and when we refused he followed with a threat to call the police."}
{"text":"Authentic Arabic and Lebanese cuisine! Being vegetarian, we ordered the Veggie Plate, falafel sandwich, Spicy Potatoes and Cheese Manakish. The food was great and we were well taken care of by our waiter. Looking forward to visiting again soon."}
{"text":"I've become a big fan of Kabab Je FOR TAKEOUT! Their food is delicious - and consistent. Every time we get the mixed grill to share (3 kebabs - 1 lamb, 1 kafta, 1 chicken served with saffron rice), the falafel appetizer and hummus. The chicken and kafta kebabs are my favorites - but the lamb is really good too (very tender). Falafel with tahini is fresh and delicious. And the hummus. Oh my. The creamiest hummus I've ever had. The portion is the size of what you buy at Harris Teeter, so you definitely get leftovers. Be sure to ask for extra pita for the next day!  Again, I love this place for takeout and only for takeout. I don't love the dining room/ambiance of the restaurant, but I'm happy to bring it home!"}
{"text":"Ate dinner here tonight with 2 other couples. Meats on meats on meats. Oh, and apps! REAL authentic Lebanese/Mediterranean food. Grape leaves, hummus, garlic yogurt, chicken, beef, lamb, all seasoned to perfection. The staff is incredibly helpful, so if you're new to this food genre, be sure to ask questions. Great atmosphere, and a beautiful patio. Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Food: Amazing  Staff: Knowledgeable Dinning Area: a bit cramped but apparently very authentic. Atmosphere: a bit warm but there is a HUGE oven less then 10ft away, Sooo..."}
{"text":"Words can't explain the taste that I enjoy every time I visit this place , Guys you are friendly awesome . The Owner such presentable and professional man running this business with a warm welcome and attention to details.  Thank you  Khaldoun Jaber"}
{"text":"Some how took me 2 years to find this place (sad face). My husband and I are both middle eastern and this is the best mid east restaurant we have been to in NC. It is amazing. The food is so delicious and authentic. Their bread is the best I have ever eaten in my life. I had the kofta kabob and my husband had the mixed kabob plate, all three kabobs (kofta, chicken, and shish) were amazing. I cannot wait to go back again and again."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants to visit.  Today my husband and I had lunch and both tried something new on the menu.  You will never go wrong.  Our waiter Kelly was awesome with service and recommendations.    Please visit and always have hummus and pita."}
{"text":"Hold hands with the Yelper next to you and repeat after me! Shawarma, kafta, musakaa, shawarma, kafta, musakaa! Poof - I just turned you into a shish kebab and transported you to Matthews! When you first enter, you will instantly be drawn to the large case loaded with kebabs; they are truly beautiful to look at. And right next to it, some beautiful pastries. The appetizers are simply amazing -  Moutabel (creamy and smoky), Musakaa (a meal in itself), Fried Cauliflower and warm Stuffed Vine Leaves - all of it served with warm fresh baked bread. You could easily make a meal of just appetizers and a salad!! Any and all of the kebabs are good - so pick your preference of chicken, lamb or beef. The entree portions are served on a platter with enough rice and roasted vegetables to feed a small family. My first experience with Shawarma was very tasty - hints of vinegar and cinammon from the marinade - though maybe just a bit dry. I love that you can bring your own beer for a fifty cent per bottle fee ( just bring a growler to get through that loophole!). 4.5 Stars rounded up to Five. Definitely worth a field trip to Matthews!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I live in uptown Charlotte. Kabab is the furthest restaurant we drive to and well worth it. The pita bread is brought out fresh from the oven and the entrees are big enough to share! The owner is always personable and seating never takes too long. We have tried many Mediterranean restaurants in Charlotte and surrounding areas but this one is top of the list for us!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The atmosphere, service and food are top notch. The soups are delicious, with the Chicken Rice being my favorite. For the entrees, the minced chicken is excellent ( however, everything is great). We love this place"}
{"text":"Wow...this is the best Lebanese Middle Eastern restaurant in the Queen City. This was my fourth trip here and each one is better than the last!  It is set in a strip mall in Matthews but dont let that fool you...it is AUTHENTIC Great food!. We had the Fatoush Salad. Fresh and covered with Extra Feta we ordered. We had the Fried Cauliflower that was drizzled with tahini, We also had the Moutaba, which is the outstanding smoked eggplant dip..so good I dream about it!  And to finish it off we had a Manakish Zaatar, which is a Flatbread topped with Zaatar and cheese, also outstanding! . All of this food is so fresh and prepared right for you. The Servers are polite and efficient and helpful ! I have pictures for you too. I am telling you- Go here and try it, you will love it !"}
{"text":"This was a amazing find! Outstanding food and service! Owner came in and was so friendly asking if everything was ok. Never having been there before we were treated to a sample of meat and sauces, which helped in picking what we wanted! Save room for the dessert, it's well worth it! Trust me you will be bringing home leftovers as well!! Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"I'm back for another healthy, outstanding meal! Fattoush salad topped with Farrouj Meshwi! This is perfect on this 90+ degree day! I keep returning because the menu choices are outstanding and HEALTHY! The service is impeccable the cleanliness of this restaurant is superb, and I can't say enough about the how I am always positively greeted and made to feel like I am family when I come to this restaurant.    Do not miss this amazing dining experience in Matthews! Nothing else can compare!  Ignore the negative reviews they are obviously being posted by a negative former employee! We have been coming to this restaurant for almost 3 years and never have had a bad experience with the service or the food! You will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Holy yes!  I was in the land of the burbs and per usual I whipped out the ol' Yelp app and found something close to where we were running our errands.  I thought I'd be stuck with a chain or something of the sort but no, this place really impresses.  Fresh meats, great staff and authentic mediteranean food.  I'd literally eat here everyday if I were closer.  The pricing was affordable also.  As far as interiors, don't expect much.  It's nothing cozy or fancy, just utilitarian.  You can't go wrong here no matter what!"}
{"text":"The lamb shank was great. Good smoked eggplant appetizer. Service was excellent. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"If authenticity and great staff is what you're looking for than look no further. My go to place for lebanese food. Best of all its locally owned not chain so make it better to support the community"}
{"text":"What a great family owned restaurant!  Fantastic service. Delicious food. You gotta get the hummus!  More pita fresh out of the oven than you can handle!  Arrived hungry, left full!  Large portion sizes.  You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"came back today for second time for lunch this time.  food was delicious.  Love the fresh pita bread and hummus and my sandwich was delicious."}
{"text":"Such delicious and conscientiously prepared authentic Lebanese dishes. The lentil soup is a masterpiece. I recently had the lamb shank special and was blown away.  It's the best Mediterranean restaurant in Charlotte."}
{"text":"My first time trying Lebanese food here it was so amazing and delicious I recommend the falafel the chicken shawarma and lamb shank"}
{"text":"Lebanese food is by far my favorite. This place is a gem! We ordered a little bit of everything and it was all so fresh and delicious. Busy crowd for lunch on Saturday, a variety of couples and families. We wish you were closer because we would be here every week."}
{"text":"Huge portions, flavorful food, friendly service and a convenient location.   Come hungry. Really. And make sure you get some garlic sauce, no matter what you order.   I'm generally not much of a salad eater, but the Spicy Lebanese Salad is really wonderful. Filling, but light enough to not slow you down. The kebabs and shawarma are really great, but the yellow rice is the best part about the entrees. It might seem strange to have raisins in the rice, but trust me on this one: it's exceptional."}
{"text":"This was some of the best food I've ever had. The Hummus and Falafel appetizers were delicious and it was probably the softest Pita bread I've ever had. My entree was also unbelievably great with the garlic sauce. The service was also fantastic, as the waiter was very attentive.   10/10 Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Delicious! I honestly stumbled upon this place completely by accident and was so pleasantly surprised.  I ordered the veggie entree which allows you to pick 4 of the vegetarian options (there are many to choose from including falafel, grape leaves, lentils, tabouleh, etc). My waitress was incredibly helpful as I had no clue what to pick! I was presented with a HUGE plate of food and every bite was phenomenal. I love the ability to pick and choose so that I was able to get exactly what I wanted and sample a few of their different dishes at once.  Service was wonderful - my server Courtney was awesome! I will definitely be returning when I'm back in the area!"}
{"text":"I will start off by saying that I am SO disappointed that it has taken me this long to find this delicious food!  My husband and I happened to be in the plaza, I looked up another restaurant on my trusty Yelp! App and saw that I had bookmarked this place.  So, we decided to give it a try!    We started with the hummus and pita bread and it was fantastic.  Perfectly flavored, the fresh pita bread compliments the hummus wonderfully.   I am somewhat of a picky eater, so I went with the grilled chicken kabobs, fries and added grape leaves for my husband to try.  With the first bite, I knew we were in for a treat.  The chicken is hands down the best chicken dish I've ever had at a restaurant.  Perfectly seasoned, fresh and delicious.  My husband demolished his food in record time, which is always a good sign.    The atmosphere was excellent.  We loved looking in the glass cases to see the different food options and watching them fire up the pita bread before serving it.  The service was probably the best we've had at any restaurant in Charlotte!    Atmosphere  Service with a smile  Delicious food that I'll be dreaming about   Try it - you'll like it!"}
{"text":"Today I went there for lunch and it was great! Nice atmosphere, the service good, and the food was delicious. I recommend you try it."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. I must provide a caveat. I have searched everywhere for Pistachio Baklava and they have it! Besides that they have the best hummus, falafel, and tabouli I have had in Charlotte. Oh, and I can't forget to mention the fresh, hot pita bread. Yum! So glad I found this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Had a very poor experience here.  First off, the server forgot one of our appetizers and it actually went to another table.  Salad was soaked with oil:/  the server had forgotten plates and utensils, so we waited 13 minutes for that before we started our appetizers.  Next, we finally got our food.  We questioned if it was 2 chicken kebabs or if it was something else....because both were labeled differentlt.  We questioned the server to make sure we got the right food...he actually picked up the sandwich and squeezed it with his hand....touching it.  What the heck?????!!!!! Then said oh its chicken.  At this point he was crappy towards us so I spoke up and said please make another one because u touched the sandwich with ur hands.  I mean would u eat it after it was touched?  Our adana kebab was burnt literally burnt and dry.  We were so frustrated that we didn't return it.  For four people, it was way overpriced.  We had a very unpleasant experience and will not be coming back.  Perhaps for people who don't know real Mediterranean food, this is good.  They didn't take anything off the bill, not expecting them too, but the food was way off par:/  touching the food and not offering an apology, not cool!  We prefer another hole in the wall place where the food is on point and about half the price.  First and last time eating here."}
{"text":"This is hands-down the best Mediterranean restaurant I have ever been to! It is a favorite of my family and we weekly make the trip to buy a hummus to go. It is the best dish there! The staff is very kind and attentive and the atmosphere is extremely family friendly. Try this place- you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Believe the hype: this place serves the best -if not the only- Mediterranean food in the greater charlotte area. I would have easily given it 5 star if it wasn't for the slow service.  Couple of months ago, my parents were visiting from out of town and they were wondering if Charlotte had any Middle Eastern restaurant to try. One of my cousins who lived in Charlotte longer than I have, suggested Kabab-Je Rotisserie & Grille, so we went.   Traditional Mediterranean fare. I'm talking about warm dolmas (stuffed grape leaves), foul mudammas (an ancient Middle Eastern bean dip) and an irresistible kanafeh (golden phyllo with a base of gooey N slightly salty cheese, and topped with spiced syrup).  Give Kabab-Je a try and you won't be disappointed!!   Four and Half Yelps!"}
{"text":"Had a awesome lunch experience.  Warm fresh Pita bread with olive oil great touch. Chicken kabobs was good.  Clean restaurant.  Comfortable."}
{"text":"We are ready to go back.  We were in Matthews for a family event and decided to check it out.  Now here we are at home a 105 miles away and want to go back for more.  The Tabboulieh was the best ever.  I thought I made fantastic tabboulieh but this was so much better.  We both had the Lamb Shank which came on a bed of rice and veggies.  Our waiter told us what kind of rice it was, maybe Basmati but I don't think that is what he said nevertheless my husband nor I are big rice fans but by the time we finished our meals later that evening back in the motel where we ate every morsal. The Pita was light and freshly made.  It was good enough to take an extra one with us.  I suspect we will make a trip sometime soon just to eat there.  Lastly the owner was there and it is obvious from his demeanor how much he cares for people including his staff.  He told us about his daughter attending law school in Columbia where we live.  His zest for life spreads to restaurant."}
{"text":"It takes every ounce of willpower not to grab the hummus serving spoon and lick it clean. This food is deeeelish. Best hummus, falafel, fresh hot pita, great meats, and super tabouli. Appetizer portions are generous.  Moussaka worth a try."}
{"text":"Ladies and gentlemen, you need this pita bread in your life. It's actually a moral imperative at this point to hoof it on down to Matthews and experience it because, if you haven't, you are truly doing yourself a disservice!  But it's not just pita bread that makes this place great--it's the kebabs, the shawarma, it's the you-pick-four vegetarian plate that filled up even my crazily carnivorous tummy! Everything I've tried here has been well-seasoned, expertly prepared, and served hot and heaping by some of the funniest and friendliest waitstaff I've ever encountered. The staff and the owner seem to be truly passionate about making sure diners have a great first impression of Lebanese cuisine. I was hooked from the first bite and have never been disappointed as I've worked my way through a fair bit of the menu.   Highlights for me are: ***the baba ghanouj and tabouleh (authentically awesome) ***the fresh pita bread (remember, moral imperative) ***fried cauliflower (never a better way to eat cruciferously) ***a second basket of pita bread (because you will be fighting your fellow diners for it at some point--so awkward!) *** mixed grill (order the lamb kebab like you do your steak so as not to risk drying out the deliciousness) ***shawarma hummus plate (you will have leftovers, just don't forget the pita bread!) ***spicy potatoes (the sexy, exotic version of home fries) ***date bar or pretty much any pastry in the case (really can't go wrong here)  Things to know: ***the inside dining space is small, so if you have issues with personal dining space, best sit outside if the weather permits ***the mixed veg blend served with entrees is different than most places (seasoned blend of carrot coins, celery, onion, and green pepper)--some folks complained about this, but I thought they were delicious and a refreshing change ***the restaurant is busy, so get there early for dinner ***parking is at a premium in this busy shopping center so be prepared, but it's worth it!  Enjoy, folks! Pita Bread for President in 2016"}
{"text":"Great food, great service and very clean. Staff was super friendly and attentive. They explained the menu and options. Would recommend the hummus and babaganoush to start. The sample meat plate was very good. Portion sizes are huge. Nice ambience, not rushed at all, great place to meet for lunch or dinner. Mean was perfectly cooked and succulent."}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant!! Everything I have had there is great. I recommend the mixed kabab entrée, chicken kabab, or the salmon ones. I always order a double serving of rice instead of the veggies-   Great service, fresh food and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I told my husband I wanted to go out and eat healthy. I wasn't sure where he was going to take me. We ended up here and I was amazed!! So many healthy and delicious option. The service was always top notch!  I am extremely excited for their second  location to open at Stone Crest across from the movie theater."}
{"text":"Giving this place 5 stars for service, promptness, and Southern kindness. Went with 3 other coworkers absolutely starved, and we were greeted kindly and sat immediately. The menu was more extensive than I was expecting, haven been to a number of Mediterranean places in Charlotte with limited menus. We ordered two eggplant dip appetizers, both wonderful, and the accompanying pita tasted fresh.   We ordered a mix of dishes, myself choosing a meat pita sandwich, which I found too large to finish but had good flavor and relatively fresh-tasting ingredients.   I'd give 4 stars for the food, but an overwhelming 5 for the staff's service. I'm not sure my tea ever got below half a glass without having a prompt refill."}
{"text":"We were introduced to this restaurant when a friend held her birthday celebration there. They have fantastic Lebanese and Middle Eastern food with a wide variety to fit any food restrictions or preferences. Vegetarian or vegan? Check. Gluten free? Check. Devout carnivore? Check. The plates are generous and the service is excellent! Go now! What are you waiting for?"}
{"text":"Great service. Came around 3:15 Sunday evening. Nice relaxed atmosphere. Food is great. Nice sized portions and the staff is very knowledgeable of what is in each dish. Good thing for people who have allergies to certain items. I had the salmon kebab my boyfriend had the chicken shawarma sandwich. The salmon was the larger portion but the sandwich was just as filing."}
{"text":"Some of the best Mediterranean food I've had in NC.  It's a very cute restaurant with an open kitchen and counters filled with the neatest salads, desserts, finger foods, etc.  We came for lunch and it was pretty busy but we did not have to wait for a table.  They have indoor and outdoor seating which is really nice.  We sat indoors because it was a bit hot outside.  Our waiter was incredibly helpful, well-spoken and he brought us samples of the shawarma--which we had to try after Robert Downey Jr seemed so interested in it in the movie The Avengers (we had never tried it).  It was so good!  They have excellent hummus, salads are perfection, and if you don't get the pita bread you are seriously going to regret it!  We had the cauliflower sandwich, shawarma sandwich, falafal and salad, all were tasty.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The hot peta breads and the baba ganoush on the side will make you go crazy. This is one of the best Mediterranean I have had in a long long time, at par with some of the best around US and probably the best in Charlotte and surrounding areas. The chicken shawarma platter were large portions and were good for me and my wife. Loved the look and feel of the restaurant and the deserts are really amazing. This is going to be our top hit for Mediterranean and would recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"This place is a gem! Delicious Lebonese food conveniently located. The prices are more than fair.  This restaurant is one of our favorites."}
{"text":"Shawarma hummus plate FTW! I thought I liked hummus. I thought I'd had pretty good hummus. I've eaten hummus in Greece AND Turkey, for crying out loud. I thought I knew what was up in the world of hummus. Then, I went to Kabab-Je and had their shawarma hummus plate. My world was rocked, y'all. My mind blown. Every bite of hummus I'd ever had was brought into question. What was this crap I'd been eating and how does Kabab-Je make hummus so good it puts all others to shame?   Part of the magic is the meat (a combo of beef and lamb) they pile on top. Warm and flavorful, freshly carved from the giant kabob spinning at the front of the store. The freshly baked, warm, fluffy pita bread doesn't hurt either. Still, I think they must be sprinkling crack or MSG or something else addictive on top of that hummus. I just can't get enough! Good thing all that is only $8.95.   After every visit, I find myself thinking about when I can go back again without embarrassing myself too much. Is lunch and dinner in the same day too much? Asking for a friend."}
{"text":"This place has awesome food and the service is wonderful! So glad to have such an awesome place to eat in Matthews without having to go far! Yummy hummus and pita bread!"}
{"text":"Food is so good here. Bread is amazing! Hummus is creamy. I love how they put raisins in the rice makes  flavor pop in your mouth!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for something new to try for dinner, and decided on this place. What a gem!  On first glance, we weren't sure how great it would be. It felt more like a lunch stop than dinner, but we now we know better. There is also outside seating. Everything is made in house. I thought I had had humus, until I tried theirs. The owner said it takes 3 days to make and it is awesome. The pita is also fresh made, baked, and brought straight from the oven. Having never tried Lebanese food, we weren't sure what to get. Our waiter was super helpful including bringing out a sample of the meats and garlic and tahini sauces. I had never even heard of shawarma until I saw the Avengers movie. Tony Stark was right to want it if it was anything like what we had. We also tried the skewers. We will be coming back soon and be bringing friends."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in the area! I'll keep this short and simply say EVERYTHING is great. Simple, fresh ingredients, but absolutely NO simple taste. You MUST check this place out!!!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent  Food was delicious  I ordered Chicken Kabob , Tabouleh, Hummus - everything was clean, food delicious and service on point- I will be back soon"}
{"text":"They offer authentic Lebanese food. The menu is huge, and they also have deli style take-out. The staff is enthusiastic about the food and very friendly. Portions are giant. Even when it was very busy, we didn't wait long for our order.   The open kitchen is in the center, surrounded by deli cases and tables all around this. Check out the website to see the variety of food available: http://www.kababje.com/gallery.html. At the back there is an oven and a baker churning out a constant supply of hot ballooned pita breads. You get as much fresh bread as you want with each meal.   The tabouli and spicy lentil soup were wonderful. Fried Cauliflower with tahini sauce was tasty. Chicken kababs were also good. The baklava was flaky, buttery and not too sweet. I wish I lived closer - I would be a regular. There are so many things on the menu I want to try."}
{"text":"Yes, yes, yes! This place is worth every penny and every minute you spent traveling to get here. Do yourself a favor and head over here tonight.   We've each had something different every time we've been and have not been let down.  Another note - everyone is super friendly. Honestly, this is a five star experience with two star prices.  Go! What are you waiting for??"}
{"text":"How could this not be my favorite place? The absolute greatest service by everyone that works there, sweetest owner & OMG the food!!! Our previous waiter remembered us and came to keep checking on us on top of our awesome Yaz. There is no place in Charlotte that out does this restaurant as whole"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this awesome place just looking for something different. At first seeing Mediterranean food our first thought was Greek.  We were quickly seated outside on the patio where we were greeted by a very friendly waiter named Ray who informed us the restaurant was Lebanese. As we looked over the menu  our waiter brought us out a little sample plate filled with some different meats and sauces so we could experience some flavors before we ordered. The girls wiped the plate out before I even could get a piece. Well from there on out everything we ordered was was awesome. The smoked eggplant dip with fresh made warm pitas,chicken wings, shrimp kabob, chicken wrap,3 meat kabob dinner and a childrens pizza. One tasted better then the next. After dinner I had to try a true Lebanese dessert a warm cheese with wheat germ crushed and rose water syrup wow what a different and delicious dish. Food is great, service was even better can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Enjoyable place to eat and the food is yummy. Kind of cramped inside and some of the food is a little bland, but otherwise great and staff is really nice."}
{"text":"I have tried a number of dishes here and loved them all.  My husband (a vegetarian) can't seem to get enough of this place either.  You are treated like family (the kind that likes each other or at least pretends to on special holidays) every time you walk through the door.  The food is outstanding, the wait-staff is pleasant and knowledgeable.  The hummus is amazing, fresh warm pita bread, their tahini sauce is to die for.  The portion sizes are large, always left overs.  Although there is a little inconsistency with the food depending on maybe time of day or who is cooking it, it may not always be the same, it is always delicious. I would not save room for dessert though."}
{"text":"The food taste great and the service was good. The overall experience would have been much better if they had a larger venue , unfortunately the place gets really crowded. Not the place for a romantic dinner."}
{"text":"Fast, casual dining! Food is fresh, not quite what I'm used to expect out of Arabic food though. A few of the dishes are prepared well. Rice is usually plain and under seasoned and over cooked. Maybe it's just the variety they use."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful lunch here a few weeks ago and couldn't wait to come back. Food was exceptional! Coupled with friendly, helpful wait staff in a relaxed, unhurried atmosphere. Food came out hot and quick, but we didn't feel rushed. The best news is I see they are opening a restaurant in Stone Crest. Definitely give Kabab- Je a try. If you aren't sure about items on the menu, ask your server. They are ALL happy to help you out."}
{"text":"absolutely phenomenal eats. it was our first time dining here and our server, raymond, went above and beyond to familiarize us with the menu and let us sample some sauces. if you're in the area and are in the mood for some mediterranean cuisine, look no further."}
{"text":"Amazing. Every time we go, it's fresh delicious and crowded but it turns over fairly quickly!  My favorite place to eat by far!"}
{"text":"This is truly amazing Mediterranean and middle eastern cuisine. I've tried the lentil soup, roasted potatoes, falafel, tabbouleh and hummus. All amazing, fresh and perfect."}
{"text":"Dining with my Family in celebration of Mothers Day! My Daughter Loves it. Our server Mr Mahmoud gave my Family excellent service and made great suggestions. Fresh food and great friendly service, I will be returning more often, just became my favorite place."}
{"text":"This is a terrific restaurant. We went there yesterday and everything we ordered was terrific. We also had the best service I have had in a long time. You can tell that the employees are passionate about the food they serve, which is very unusual. Highly recommend if you like Mediterranean food!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome the falafel impeccable. All of the food was made fresh and you could really taste it. The chicken shawarma and the teutaki sauce was great. My family enjoyed each of their dishes this will be on my list of go to places."}
{"text":"Excellent place where everything is fresh and home made, all at good prices. I got kafta with the cucumber salad on the side. The garlic dip made it perfect.   This is very much a family owned and run place. The manager (or owner) was running a very tight ship, making sure all customers are taken care of.  Staff was very friendly and attentive. The environment has that has that private restaurant feel, unlike the many chain restaurants. Makes me feel right at home like my favorite places in Chicago or NYC and not in a strip mall.   I highly recommend this place, and I for sure will be a regular here."}
{"text":"The best falafel sandwich I've had in charlotte . Finally one that's not burned to a crisp , drier than the Sahara, and flavorless . This goodness is quite the opposite; perfectly done, moist ( sorry for all of you moist haters out there), and truly an explosion of complementing flavors. It's also wallet-friendly :) I can't wait to try out the other great options on the menu ."}
{"text":"Great place for Vegans and their meat eating friends! Have been here twice now and enjoyed the food very much both times. We have had the hummus, falafel, fried cauliflower and a smoked eggplant spread I can't name. All of it was delicious and very flavorfull. The manager is very nice and hands on in his business which is good to see. The staff are all polite and accommodating. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the dining room is in need a a thorough dusting which is apparent especially on the lighting fixtures above the bread.  Bread is also delicious, but I'd like less dust so close to it."}
{"text":"I can't rave enough about this place. I have been about three times and always get the veggie plate--it has been phenomenal every time. The batata harra (spicy potatoes) and grilled veggies (seasoned to perfection!) are always the highlight, along with the pita bread that is light as air. The servers are also always very helpful and efficient. Wish it weren't so far away from me!"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious and the waiter was very friendly. We were at first very excited to have found something so good and so close to home. However, we will not be back because of how rude and unprofessional the owner/manager (?) was. Almost immediately after we finished eating, he asked our group of 4 to leave because he needed the table for people who were waiting. There were only a few people waiting and there were several tables open. We were shocked and disappointed because we certainly would have returned, but we will not support someone who doesn't appreciate his potentially loyal customers."}
{"text":"Kabab Je is pretty amazing, starting with their staff, which is a great thing when you're talking about us southerners who often have little clue about Persian food. On the downside, it can be a bit overwhelming, and move from the \"happy to help you\" to the \"why not sit down because you're here so much\" variety, but they are so stinking nice, it's really not a bad thing - just that it can interrupt conversations, if you mind that sort of thing.  When it comes to the food, many things are just this side of amazing. The hummus, as has been mentioned, is some of the best in Charlotte, but do yourself a favor, and order the moutabal (eggplant) instead - it's that good. There isn't any harm in trying the hummus, of course, but the moutabal is awesome.  Almost oddly, there is no shortage of Persian food in Charlotte, this goes more to the quick-serve variety, which means that the food comes out quickly, as opposed to some other places that can take a while. That's a good thing, as you can pop in for a quick dinner, or even food to go, and they have plenty of things pre-prepared in their deli cases so you can take it home to boot. Nice."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place!! The meat is grilled to perfection and the shwarma here is marvelous! The bread and sauces are so fresh! We really, really love this place. The only problem is that we can't find hardly any other restaurants that we can enjoy--they've spoiled us."}
{"text":"Did I eat at a different restaurant than all these posters?   We drove out here for lunch from Huntersville and were both disappointed with our meals. I ordered the chicken skewers and he had a wrap with fries. My chicken was gummy and hard to eat. The vegetables on my plate were a joke - carrot coins? onions and celery? How cheap can you be? After a couple pieces of chicken, I gave up on my plate all together. He didn't finish his wrap either. The only good part of our meal was the hummus and warm pita to start. Our waitress was pushy and seemed inexperienced. She dropped off our menus and came back with water asking for our orders. Not only was the food not good it was expensive for what it was. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else. Rarely does yelp lead me astray."}
{"text":"A gem - do not miss it. Excellent appetizers, the best hummus on the planet (seriously!) and fabulous Lebanese favors. I've dined here many times and have never been disappointed - highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I have dined here a lot and continue to love it.  The lunch specials are all good (I like the salads topped with chicken Schwarma) and the staff is awesome.  The owner is frequently here and keeps a watchful eye over quality of the food and service.  He's a nice dude too."}
{"text":"I had read great reviews of this place so we decided to try it out one rainy Sunday afternoon. I ordered a vegetarian plate (hummus, lentils, a salad and more-ask your waiter for help, they explained all dishes very well) and my husband got the lamb. I've never cared much for lamb but this was delicious! I tasted cinnamon and other spices that worked SO well with the very tender meat. It came with a stew of veggies and was more than two people could eat. In fact, both dishes were huge. They also bake their own pitas there, and they are fresh, warm and tasty - perfect for dipping . We took hope a few desserts, the baklava, a date cake and a piece of chocolate cake. All of the food was delicious except the date cake (like a super buttery fig newton-it was just too rich with not enough flavor).  The only downside was service. We came at an odd time, around 2pm. I always find that to be the absolute worst time to get good service (rush is over, check out & servers seem to get busy with side work) so I'll let it slide. Plus, they sat us in an odd spot near the bathroom/kitchen area so we were out of sight, out of mind (and they forgot/lost our ticket). They did try to make up for it with a wonderful cabbage salad & hummus apps for free. That cabbage salad was one of the best things I've ever tasted, and it's not even on the menu. The chef was just trying it out that day as a special. Everything tasted so great and the compensation for the poor service gets them 4 stars, and will go back for more. I love it when I leave a restaurant and can't stop thinking about going back for days. This was that kind of meal.  The atmosphere is pretty good if you're not seated in the back. I like that the kitchens and baking area are open. There's a lot to watch and while our server wasn't attentive, I have to say that the others were very concerned about us and made sure we were well taken care of. I'd recommend this place anytime for lunch or dinner. Just know that you can split any meal and leave full - probably with leftovers."}
{"text":"The most excellent middle eastern food in Charlotte!! None of the others even compare!! Our family's favorite!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants. The best pita bread I've ever had. Baked fresh and served hot. Everything I've tried is delicious."}
{"text":"We tried many dishes today since this was our first time eating at Kabab Je.  A Lebanese friend recommended it  to us.  We tried falafel, kibbeh, meat pies, and stuffed grape leaves.  All were delicious!  The waitress was very friendly and knowledgeable about all the dishes.  She was very attentive and check on us often.  We look forward to going back."}
{"text":"If I could give 6 stars I would. Great Mediterranean food. Possibly the best in the greater Charlotte area. Try the fried cauliflower and the minced lamb kabab you will not be disappointed. Ask for Kelly (server) he will definitely make your experience more enjoyable."}
{"text":"Loved it! Had the falafel appetizer - which came out quickly and the mixed grill. Plenty of food - cooked well and did not disappoint.  Server was able to make solid recommendations and asked the right questions about whether or not I'm a vegetarian (which good to know there are vegetarian options).  Coming back soon."}
{"text":"This place is impressive. Coming from DC where we are overrun with kebab joints, kebab je takes the cake. The food is extremely fresh and always steaming hot. They will overload you with fresh pita bread so make sure to cut them off so they dont spoil your meal. The wait staff there are some of the nicest people I have encountered at a restaurant. Even the owner will stop by your table and check in. Give this place a try, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Great service and even better food. The Shawarma is in believable! Quiet and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"They make the best pita bread I have ever placed in my mouth. It is so good you can eat just the bread by itself.   And the beef kebabs... Religious experience. I love this place. I will visit here every time I fly in from now on I think.   10/10 would scarf again."}
{"text":"I've only been twice (so far) and both experiences were awesome. EXCELLENT food and service. The wait staff is very knowledgeable and helpful in selecting dishes are not familiar. My friend and his family are huge fans and they brought me for lunch one day. I was blown away. I invited MY friends last week for lunch and they can be picky. They too loved their entrees and will be back! I can't wait to take my husband!"}
{"text":"I love the chicken kabob with the garlic sauce.  Most recently we had the mixed veggie dinner and the mixed kabob dinner and everything was fantastic.  We have been twice in the last month and it will be a regular for our eat out choices!"}
{"text":"Meat too dry and not enough flavor.  Sides are the same with all three entries, that is stir fry frozen veges.  Cauliflower roast was delicious however.  Service was so so, had to flag down for request.  Soda comes in a bottle, not fountain, not cans... weird.  Not worth the wait at all."}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite place for Mediterranean food! The hummus is absolutely the best I've ever had anywhere. I literally have never tasted better hummus. The pita bread is hot and fresh. Everything I've eaten here has been outstanding. Prices are reasonable and service is great. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is very classy and authentic!  A little pricey but well worth it.  All was good including the service. Recommend the Sambusek falafel shawarma Burma hummus is what we had the marinated wings were awesome as well!  We ll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I found this place years ago and it has consistently been great. The owner is almost always here and very personable. He is someone who is very good at remembering faces and names and seems to truly enjoy taking care of customers. The food is amazing. There are times when I follow a vegetarian diet and there are many choices. The falafel and fried cauliflower are well seasoned. You can get them alone, as a platter or as a sandwich as with most of their items. The vegetable stews and spinach pies are also great choices. For those who eat meat, the kafta kish kash and lamb platter are very good. The lamb is cooked all day and many nights is on special. The shawarma is moist and cooked perfectly. It is not the premade \"slab o meat\" that many places use. It is great on the salads and again, available as a platter or sandwich as well. There are kids items for young ones as well as manakish \"pizzas\" that fulfill the need as well as those beautiful fluffy homemade pitas that come to the table still steaming. The wait staff is always on point and happy to explain some of the more exotic menu items. If you are not ridiculously full from the large portions, consider one of the homemade desserts and some Lebanese coffee."}
{"text":"Amazing food, best I have had here in Charlotte. Love the Grilled Chicken (Farouge Meshwi) and Veggie Plate. So fresh... Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Absolutely excellent Middle Eastern food!! Kabab Je is spot on; very authentic menu, fresh ingredients, and generous portions. Prices are fair/reasonable. I wish they'd give the picked veggies and olives as a garnish on the table like our favorite Middle Eastern place back in northern Jersey. My only other suggestion for improvement would actually be an expansion if possible. Kabab Je gets too crowded on certain times/on certain days. Their outdoor seating is wonderful (love the fountain view) but needs many, many more fans (the two they have aren't cutting it in this Charlotte heat). Overall, though, Kabab Je Rotisserie and Grille is absolutely awesome and I cannot wait to visit again and again. We've been eating this type of cuisine for years and had access to very authentic Israeli, Lebanese, and Palestinian food for decades (in NYC and Chicago). When we go for Middle Eastern food we always order lebneh (fresh white cheese drizzled w/ olive oil). That being said, Kabab Je's Lebne was the BEST we've ever had!! Super fresh and thick...I'm craving it now just thinking about it."}
{"text":"Holy moly, this place has been so close and I have passed it by TOO many times. First of all, we went on a Sunday afternoon - (always a tough time to get in somewhere at this hour without fighting the post-church, Sunday errands crowd). It was jam packed. There were lots of big parties waiting, so my son and I were able to sneak in and get a wee little table right in front of the door. (It was a little annoying since the main door kept opening and we'd get really drafty). That said, our server was amazing - very attentive and great with the kid (my child is 6 years old and can sometimes be finicky with food/drink choices). We ultimately got the roasted eggplant appetizer (Moutabal). That and the bread would suffice for a meal - but I ordered the Shish Tawouq as well. (My son got chicken nuggets and fries of course). Everything came out quick and was absolutely fresh. Honestly I agree with 90% of the other reviewers, there is nothing that will ever beat the super-hot, super-fresh pita that comes out pre-meal. The crowd was really impressive as the wait was overflowing out the door. The \"garlic sauce\" aka Lebneh was so crazy good - I would have devoured my kid's fries in it if I wasn't already overstuffed with my own meal. The whole ordeal cost about $30 and was well worth every penny. Honestly, I never touched the veggies or the rice that came with my Entree, so you could just plan on taking home leftovers and this place could feed you for a couple of meals.  Service was impeccable and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. After being disappointed the first time we visited this restaurant we decided to give it another try several months later when invited by some friends. Things have turned around 180 degrees. They have a new amazing chef who makes his own customizations and you need to try his hot sauce. The food thus far is very delicious :) Favorite meal is the lamb kabob entree which comes out very juicy and not over cooked. Now we bring our friends here.   Things you need to try: killer combo get the charcoled eggplant (babganush), with humus, the chefs hot sauce and also include the garlic cream and put it on their housemate fresh off the grill pita bread. Husband absolutely loves this combo!  Go here all the time now ;) highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My Wife and I stopped by for lunch, and couldn't have been more pleased.  The Falafels were excellent, the fresh made Pita bread was maybe the best I have had.  The owner and staff always made sure we were happy and taken care of.  This place will be on our list of regular stops."}
{"text":"Best restaurant my wife and I have eaten at in Charlotte so far.  We frequent it often and the food is always top notch and service is great.  Highly recommend the Hummus, shawarma, and desserts."}
{"text":"I was recently visiting family in NC and my daughter insisted we have lunch here. So glad we did! The food is authentic and amazing! I had the minced lamb kebab! Delicious! You have to be open to the real deal here! Lebanese at its finest! No fake American altered cuisine! You get to watch them prepare your food fresh too! The food case was so beautiful in the center of it all that I had a hard time deciding what to order! Lol!   I over heard someone not happy with their dish and the server was extremely accommodating to replace it for them right away! I could tell it was the flavor and not the dish!!!!! Remember, you have to have the palette for authentic cuisine! This is no run of the mill place!    The owner went out of his way to greet us. Since my daughter frequents the place, they were very attentive, but I noticed that all the guest are treated that way too! I loved the flavors of my food so much that I had to score a container of spice to bring back to Arizona! They have a small selection of items you can purchase and the staff will educate you on how to use them. I've used this particular spice, not sure the name of it, the tag came off during my travels, on everything from my morning eggs to my chicken, fish and of course LAMB! Wow!   Lastly, it is a great place for inside or outside seating, large or small groups except call ahead for parties over 10 so they can accommodate you accordingly. Great place for the family! The granddaughter was happy at the young age of 2 1/2 yrs old!  Seems to be ideal for catering, but not sure if they offer that. Just ask!  This will be my first stop when I return to NC in the future! Can you open one in Scottsdale??? I haven't found a good Lebanese place here yet!   Enjoy!  Pamela"}
{"text":"This place definitely satisfied our Mediterranean Food craving. The toum was perfect and the falafel was great. We ordered the grilled chicken kebab special for lunch. The atmosphere was busy but clean and welcoming. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"First time here the fresh pita was so very good.  The cucumber salad was great and the humus was amazing.  Very nice place to eat."}
{"text":"Not really not sure how this place gets so many great reviews, we have been there twice  the first time the French fries were completely raw and cold, we were told they were overcooked, the chicken was dry both times,service was okay, can't say this is a good Mediterranean restaurant, so so at best"}
{"text":"Hey, the food was good, alright? But last night shows us how our memories and senses are affected comprehensively. And in the case of a Yelper like me, that includes the commute, how the day was, the fact that I forgot to mention eating out with friends to the wife all counts.  Yeah, I forgot. So when my wife texted with delight regarding the food she was cooking right before I got off work to go to Kabab Je Rotisserie & Grille, of course I panicked. As I was driving, however, after carefully reminding the wife how I already told her that day (though not sure if I did) and promising that I would be home to eat as well, I ran past a ditch just before getting onto Independence. I do not like Independence. In fact, I don't want to go anywhere that I have to get on Independence to get to.  Anywho, I got there, met my friends, made a new friend named Syed, had a fine Shawarma sandwich and hurried out. To be honest, the shawarma sandwich was good but not great. Nothing exceptional. Don't get me wrong. It's tasty, and most importantly, affordable. I remember it to be just 5.99. But it was a decent size. Actually, the plate would have been too big for me because yes, I did have my wife's food at home. As for the service last night, it was also okay. Nothing bad. But also, not exceptionally good. The fact that you can bring your own beer with a 50 cent charge per bottle is good. But I don't know if I'll drive 40 minutes down to Matthews just for that."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Meet the owner and you will see why. Everytime I talk to someone about customer service I tell them to go watch him because he knows how to take care of people. The kibebs are amazing and with one kabob plate my family of 4 can eat. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch with great friends at this spot. Delicious food and great service. I will definitely be back. I had Sharwarma feta salad. Friends had the kebabs and rice platter.  Definitely coming back for some baklava"}
{"text":"Really good food a bit pricey service is slow and there seems on                 occasion that the waiter does nt speak English. Food is good prices a little high for whet you get"}
{"text":"Very, very good food!! Great tabouli and hummus. A very nice place to eat on the patio on Saturday or Sunday afternoon!"}
{"text":"Neighborhood gem. Service was friendly prompt and attentive. The bread was fresh out of the oven. We had. Minced chicken kabob and a lamb kabob. Both came with rice and veggies. We took food home. A lot of natives who must be regulars were eating as well - always a good sign to me. Overall we were very satisfied and will return"}
{"text":"This place is very good.  My wife and I went with another couple who ordered different dishes so we were able to try many things. Beef and chicken were great. Also tried a beef lamb mixture which was really good as well.   Staff is very friendly and knowledgable about the dishes. We will be back without a doubt. Updating my review to 5 stars. We have been to this place numerous times now and it is always excellent. The beef kabobs are my favorite and the humus is the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here since they opened.  They have never failed to deliver.  We eat here often.  Our kids love it as well. They have been raised on their hummus.  The meats, sides and desserts are always fresh and the service quick.  A great value for the portions!"}
{"text":"The falafel sandwich is very good. I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone craving middle eastern food."}
{"text":"Tried this place and was very happy. Our waitress gave good recommendations. The falafel was very yummy. All food was great. Will be going back."}
{"text":"I was on the hunt for some delicious mediterrean food after having traveled to Israel a couple of months ago  After yelping this place we decided to give it a try. It definitely took us back to all that amazing food in Israel. From the hummus and the potatos to that warm, fresh out of the oven bread they give you. I recommend the chicken Shawarma! Can't wait to come back very soon."}
{"text":"Been here twice, both times were very good.  The food is fresh and piping hot, great selection of Lebanese favorites.  The babaganoush was awesome and the pita bread soft and warm.  The sandwich wraps were great, very juicy and tasty.  This place is more \"sit down for dinner\" than grab a wrap and go.  Dine in when you have time to sit and relax.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Can't say nothing but GREAT FOOD!  Fresh and tasty.  Been here twice in the last two weeks.  Just want to keep going back.  My favorite so far is the sharwma hummus with lamb. they serve it with this wonderful warm pita bread.  A must place to visit if you are in the Matthews area!."}
{"text":"An amazing experience!  Had the Mixed Grill with tabouleh & potato harra.  Lamb was well seasoned, service was quick & friendly plus great bread."}
{"text":"Offer the spicy potatoes as a side with sandwiches without up charging! You have done this for me before and I was just told you no longer offer them as a side and if I want them with my sandwich I have to pay an extra $2.50! That's a bit outrageous for some potatoes!!! Bring them back. I love this place but that's enough to turn me away. Especially since my mom is Lebanese and can make this food all day long."}
{"text":"Disappointed in mixed grill to-go. See picture. Did not come with humus, any accompaniment. Nothing."}
{"text":"Followed the bandwagon on this one and the people have spoken. This was a great place as everyone said it was. What stood out was how fresh everything tasted. From the fresh made bread, falafel, rice, hummus, just everything was high quality which I appreciated. The service was great and I loved to see the owner out managing the restaurant. No surprise the service was on point and the food was especially quick. Not to mention the reasonable prices. Great place."}
{"text":"Great Food!  Tonight we were just in the area and decided to get dinner.  What a great decision!  The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable about the food.  The owner is kind and has a genuine display about him.  We felt welcomed!  We started with the best hummus I've had!  I couldn't stop eating and took a little home to continue my indulgence.  I had the chicken kabob and my hubby had the lamb kabob.  Both were great! Great flavor cooked perfectly!  It was accompanied with basmati rice and vegetables.  Everything I had was great! I would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Best falafel around! I used to always go to Jerusalem Cafe, but their service sucks. I was so happy that Kebab Je Rotisserie opened. The batata hara, mutabel, and baba ganoush is delish...and the service is awesome. My family's new fav in Matthews!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice...and the first time everything was awesome which is why I'm giving them a 3 stars.  While the food is good, service is GARBAGE.  The hostess barely acknowledged my presence, never looked up, I asked about the desserts and she gave me the rudest response ever, \"we have a display case.\"  Even after I ordered she didn't tell me how long it would be (it was a to go order), and after I stood there like an ass for 20 mins I asked her how long, she had the nerve to ask me what I ordered even though I was never more than 3 feet away giving her the stink eye because I was so pissed.  Owner might want to replace the sorry first impression that a customer has to put up with."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience. This place is a new favorite. The pita is made from scratch, and served from the oven. Their hummus is amazing. You must try the cauliflower appetizer as well. I visited this restaurant with family, and as a group with mixed eating styles, we all did well. I am a vegan, and was very well taken care of. The rest of my family eats whatever. They loved their meat dishes, I loved my vegan ones."}
{"text":"Looking for a decent lunch place in Matthews is like trying to find hen's teeth.  I had about given up on the local lunch scene until today.  Because I follow a somewhat healthy diet (lots of protein, nothing fried or breaded) means the abundance of Matthew's fast food restaurants is out.  I was pleasantly surprised when I visited Kabab-je for lunch today.  I ordered the Shawarma entre plate that came with saffron rice and vegetables.  My co-worker got the vegetable plate.  Both portions were HUGE.  I probably was given 8-10oz of deliciously-prepared meat/lamb.  The service was also prompt and the restaurant was clean.  I had water to drink and my bill came out to $14, a bit more than I'd like to pay for a weekday lunch.  This place would have got 5 stars from me if they offered lunch size entre portions at a smaller cost."}
{"text":"I dream of kebab je! I'm not sure where to begin the praises... perhaps with the staff? The servers and the owner himself are courteous and friendly. It's always a pleasant experience to dine here because everyone is so nice, and the service is wonderfully efficient. Move on to the food, shall we? Simply delicious. From the hot, fresh pita & creamy hummus, to the chicken kebabs / shawarma; and everything in between that I've tried, it's all fresh & yummy. If you're a vegetarian, fret not, because they have some terrific veg options as well. As you scroll through the menu, you may get over ambitious and want to order everything, but refrain from doing that because their entree portions are quite large, and you don't want to fill yourself up so much that you miss out on the assorted baklava & tea for dessert ;) The ambiance of the restaurant is casual; it's simple, clean and comfortable. Go check 'em out, and you'll be dreaming of kebab je too!"}
{"text":"Being Lebanese myself, this is the closest you can ever get to real Lebanese food in America (if not better than restaurants IN LEBANON).  Thank you, Kabab-je, for reminding me of my mom's soul food back home -- absolutely delicious!  Favs were the meat pie sambousek, lahm b ajeen, batata harra, and moutabal."}
{"text":"I keep coming back here as a regular now. I have tried almost everything on the menu and everything is amazing. Best Arabic/Med food in town. They have great options too. shawarma salad, sandwich and platter. This goes the same for many mixed grill options and lamb choices. Also the apps are great. Grape leaves, falafel, hummus etc. I can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming to the Kabob House since they first opened. There is always a warm welcome And top notch service. The food is ALWAYS fresh. We tell everyone we know. We are foodies and the Kabob House is hands down the BEST Restruant in Matthews mint hill Area. We appreciate having a go to Restruant that is always great and welcoming. We hope they are in business for years to come. Sara and Thomas."}
{"text":"Glad we found this place. Food was great, the service was great. Food was full of flavor and the fresh pita bread was amazing. Definitely will be going back!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Love their falafel and love their salads and lamb dishes . We love to come and have lunch on patio. The staff is pretty great and efficient and prices are very reasonable. Go there on weekend and have a nice meal on Patio enjoying the beautiful weather .. it's worth it .."}
{"text":"Delicious, delicious, delicious!! I just do not know where to begin. Ordering the hummus is a must! Delicious flavor and they serve it with warm, freshly baked pita which is heavenly and as big as your head! I'm picky about my falafel and theirs did not disappoint. I am also a lentil soup fanatic and their soup is very good. I probably would have licked the bowl if no one was looking. My husband ordered the Kafka sandwich- which is always one of his favorite Lebanese dishes. He said that the meat was very good and not dry. We took a few pieces of walnut and pistachio baklava home with us and I wish that we had ordered a few more. I love Lebanese food and get so excited when I can can find it around here. I'm just so glad that we found a new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"Loved the fried cauliflower with tahini. I split a veggie plate and still had leftovers. Hummus, smoked eggplant  and falafel  so delicious with the hot fresh pita bread and olive oil. Great service and hot tea  will order take out for the cauliflower cravings"}
{"text":"Authentic Mediterranean eats, best I've had in over 20 years when I lived in the Middle East.  Owner is personally engaging and exudes a great desire to make guest comfortable.  My server was overwhelmed and attempted to gloss over poor service with disingenuous engagement. The space is too small for the current layout (prep stations, grills with refrigerated cases surrounding them in the center.  Each time staff showed customers deserts in the case, their backsides were in my space...not nice EVER but especially when you're attempting to enjoy a meal. Once the owner left the floor, I was subjected to a ten minute exchange between the table behind me and a young man behind the refrigerated cases in the food prep area.  Obviously not aiming for ambiance although my check reflected a price that represented an expectation of a pleasant atmosphere.  If you can feel the effects of servers repeatedly swishing by the table, something just isn't right. I hope these detractions will be corrected as I would definitely consider a third try due to the positive aspects, maybe an earlier dinner."}
{"text":"The best thing about this place was their hummus.  It was definitely made in-house and it had the perfect amount of lemon, garlic and tahini.  It wasn't bland which tends to be the case in most places and it was very creamy.  The bread served with the hummus was definitely unique.  It was a big pastry puff  that was filled with steam/hot air.  It was fluffy and lightly salted.  It was a nice alternative to the typcial pita bread.  The rest of our dining experience was not as great.  The menu was a little challenging to follow as it just seemed all over the place.  I ordered the chicken kabob but it didn't mention what it was served with other than a side of garlic.  My husband ordered the kabob wrap and again, no sides were mentioned.  My chicken kabob was served with rice and some pickled mixed veggies (both were not very good).  The kabob itself had so much potential but it was undercooked.  The meat on the skewer was fleshy and it bounced back when I touched it.  The inside was a light pink color and not heated all the way through.  I lost my appetite pretty quickly but didn't want to say anything as we were in a hurry and didn't have time to wait for a whole other meal to come out.  It took way too long for the first meal to come out so we weren't about to wait for another one.  My husband's wrap was good but it was very small and came with no sides.  At least we will know this for next time.  He could have/should have ordered two and a side to go with it.  The service was subpar and everyone seemed stressed and unorganized.  The restaurant had an awkward lay out and super bright lights.  It was an uncomfortable dining experience overall.  There is a huge deli section in the center and then an exposed kitchen in the back and somehow a few tables positioned around the deli counter.  I think they will likely work out some of these issues but as of right now I am not impressed.  I was so excited to see a Mediterranean restaurant in the Matthews area but this place has some work to do."}
{"text":"Very good Mediterranean food. Portions are huge! Hummus was amazing. Staff was happy and friendly. Definitely gonna put this place on rotation.  I've enjoyed eating here several times and the food is always wonderful. They take care of you.   Looking forward to every visit"}
{"text":"Liked it very much the food was delicious, my only advise to them would be to be more clear on how the menu works. I thought I was ordering a listed special was later told it was not the special and my lunch ended up being $17."}
{"text":"I went to lunch with a friend and was a little nervous what I would eat, as I am not usually a big fan of Middle Eastern food.  My nerves are gone and I am stuffed!  I was blown away by how good everything was!  We started with hummus, pita (so good!), and falafel, which were all delicious.  My 3-year-old kept asking for more falafel! We actually went through 2 orders of falafel.  I can see going back to this place just for falafel and pita.  I ordered the kid meal pizza for the kiddo and a chicken kabob plate for myself.  My kid's pizza was fresh from the wood fire oven and big enough for an adult.  She was only able to eat one piece since she was so full of falafel, but declared it yummy.  We asked for fresh tomatoes on the cheese pizza, which she loved.  The chicken on the kebob plate was moist and flavorful, as were the grilled veggies and rice.  Our dining companion had a salad with shawarma steak and declared it fantastic. We ended the meal with a piece of chocolate cake for the little one, which despite being full, she managed to polish off.  The adults shared piece of coconut case and it was good.  The service was good and the staff very friendly.  My only complaint is that they have bottled soft drinks and not fountain, but hey, no place is perfect.  For Middle Eastern food, you can't go wrong stopping here.  I am still full as I write this review 6 hours later, but I am finishing so that I can go eat the leftovers and relish in the flavors again."}
{"text":"Truly amazing and delicious!  Andrew was very attentive and the hummus was as fresh as anyone could ask for. After serving in the Navy for 23 years I can remember visiting many ports and this food brought it all back. I recommend this place highly."}
{"text":"First time visit, suggested by a friend it was great. The flavors, the food was fresh and service was awesome. Our server suggested and we followed. Every suggestion worked out well."}
{"text":"What a great find.  Food is amazing, quality is great and the prices are unbelievable!  The fried cauliflower is one of the best things I have ever eaten and the garlic sauce is amazing.  Put it on everything.  Whether you are looking for a light lunch or a full dinner...you can get it here."}
{"text":"The setup - My girlfriend and I were starving at the unconventional lunch hour of 3pm so we chose this place.  It was empty but that was due to the said unconventional hour. Needless to say, (and I'm saying it anyway) we were seated immediately.  What I believe was the owner and another waiter pulled out our chairs for us to sit down.  Uh, a million points for that.    The atmosphere is nice and it's open.  You purposely see your meal being prepared as opposed to being seated at a kitchen entrance where you aren't meant to see, hear, smell your food until it's placed in front of you, but unfortunately (in most cases) you do.  I had the lamb sandwich wrap thing and my friend ordered the falafel wrap.  I tried hers and it was very good.  It was fresh and distinct in flavors.  My wrap was great except for the lamb.  It tasted as if it had been frozen and seemed a bit on the fatty side.  So, bummer.  However, I want to go back for dinner and try their kabobs and all that other jazz.  Hopefully, that'll bump them up a star or two.  Definitely will return and get the full experience."}
{"text":"Great new find! Service was outstanding and very attentive. The Hummus was amazing along with meat shawarma sandwich with rice.  A cute decor and gets busy for lunch. I will for sure be visiting more often.  Ask for recommendations and you can't go wrong. They know their stuff and serve a great meal!"}
{"text":"Wow...hands down one of the best Lebanese places in Charlotte!!  Since this was our first visit we kept it simple...spinach pie (awesome flavor and crust), falafel (best I've had!!), beef shawarma sandwich (great crust on the beef...toasting the pita takes the sandwich to another level) and last I had the Kafta sandwich (again...best in Charlotte...amazing flavor and texture...not dry as many others.) We are already looking forward to returning...   Cheers :)"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant three times a week since they opened. Yes, it's that good! You can't make a mistake on ordering, literally everything on the menu is delicious."}
{"text":"I had eggs this morning: 2, over medium with a touch of chili powder. I like eggs a lot. They're full of protein and fats, and when your on a low carb diet, those are you're end all be all of comfort.   The reason I preface my review of lunch with what I had for breakfast is I want you to appreciate how hungry I was. When you cut bread and sugar from your diet, staying satiated for longer than the run time of a long movie is pretty much out the window. The plus side is you can eat more without gaining weight on account of your body not being able to rely on that sweet sweet sugar for energy.   The negative? When you do wait, like I did, for a traditional meal to eat (to be fair, I fell asleep watching lectures on YouTube. Don't judge my Saturday) you get super hungies. So I'm yelping, and  I find this well reviewed kebab place about a 15 minute drive down 74, or in charlotte terms, down the street. I could really go for some lamb at this point, so I throw on some clothes and hit the door.   I pull into Sycamore Commons, a shopping area I frequent, so imagine my surprise when the Google box directs me to this secluded little alcove behind the Best Buy, replete with shops and a massage envy,  and a sweet frog. Amongst them is the kebab place.   The hostess seats me outside facing the fountain. The set up of the main dining room is slick, because no matter where they seat you, you walk by a deli style display case featuring ready to cook skewers of beef, of chicken, of salmon to whet your appetite. The outdoor seating area has nice stylish large umbrellas to keep the sun at bay.   The menu is classic Mediterranean, all lamb and mint and tsaziki. I ordered minced lamb - which comes in a kebab and is served with basmati rice, a tabouleh salad and hot tea. If you recall the opening paragraph, you'll remember the low carb thing, and wonder why I didn't sub out the rice for, like, a chicken wing or something. Well i, in fact, did sub it out for the Spicy Lebanese salad.  Then the spiral downward started. My order came out, and boy howdy was it wrong. The first transgression: no tabouleh. I love tabouleh. It'd been over a year since I had it, and my excitement to have it again was severely dampened by the distinct lack of it on my plate. I did get rice, though. Rice I didn't want because of the low carb thing. I tasted it. It was good. Exceptional even. Especially the carrot slaw they had on top. But still, low carb is in effect,  so I couldn't actually enjoy the rice.   Second transgression: the Spicy Lebanese salad, which came out as a side was fine. But it was out as a side and not the rice substitute that I wanted it to be. I ate it. It was pretty good, not quiet what I wanted it to be, but solid enough.   Third transgression: as I approach the bottom of my salad i have decided not to complain (because God clearly wanted me to have that rice and not tabouleh, otherwise he wouldn't have put the rice and not the tabouleh in front of me). I look again at the fountain. It's very nice, calming. Relaxing.  Three spires in white plaster or stucco, can't really tell from where I am, with water cascading down the bronze or tiled (again, can't tell) centers. It's a good fountain. I bite down on my salad, and to my horror, there's a crunch that matches no other crunch in the salad to that point. And the crunch has a bitterness, and a dryness. I spat that bite out to reveal splinters of charred black something. I was now upset.   No tabouleh? Forgivable. Rice when I can't eat it? Cruel, but I can look past that. But burned splinters in the salad? A bridge too far.   Now you're probably thinking that this is a 1 star, no recommendation review. You'd be only half right. I'm not going to recommend kebab-je because they made a Slack first impression. However they should thank the server, because no sooner than I brought the various transgressions to his attention, did he not only comp my burnt splinter salad, but he did also bring me to-go tabouleh, which is second only to during the meal tabouleh on the tabouleh depth chart.  Plus the kebab was tasty (could've used a dipping sauce, but I liked it). And until it was burnt, the salad was good. And the rice was delicious. And my water cup wasn't empty until I left.  I probably won't be back for a while, though.  *P.S., the owner has apologized and invited me back. Adding a half star to My review for the consideration. Also the tabouleh was among the best tabouleh I've had. Easily one of the 3 best salads in Charlotte. Adding another half star for the tabouleh alone."}
{"text":"Love this little spot! The best hummus I've ever had, fluffy homemade pita and delicious kebabs. The baklava and other pastries are excellent as well. Make reservations or come early, it gets crowded!"}
{"text":"Kids menu: B- for a very limited selection of the usual suspects. But skip the unhealthy, unimaginative kids menu and order off the full menu! Our kids like gyros and yellow rice, so the kofta was a great substitute.   Kids review: we liked the bread and the rice and the lamb thing (kofta). The people are really nice.   Parents review: everything was really good - the spicy sausages, felafel, tabbouleh, roasted cauliflower. The chicken lemon rice soup is the best value on the planet (under $4). The entrees are enormous so we split 2 among the 4 of us. We liked the mixed grill with the garlic sauce and the kofta. They don't serve alcohol here but we saw several people bring their own bottles, don't know if there's a corkage fee. The last notable thing about this place is the service - outstanding!! Everyone is super friendly."}
{"text":"This is really one of my favorite Mediterranean spots in charlotte (Matthews)!! The food is so clean, consistent, and fresh! Plenty of vegan/ vegetarian options, and amazing prices as well. Most of the staff is super friendly, and they do amazing homemade pita bread. So of my favorite options from here is the fried cauliflower, tabuli, and the lentil soup. I frequent this spot, so I'm still exploring the menu because there is so many fantastic options."}
{"text":"Food is always great. No bad options on their menu. Little bit pricier, but win decent portions"}
{"text":"My buddy had been telling me about this spot for a while. Omg! You definitely get your moneys worth. My favorite items were the fried cauliflower, tabouli, and hummus! They have veggie platters and you can mix and match from a variety of foods. Very vegan friendly place. I will be going back very soon :)"}
{"text":"My first time here I got a pick up order and my little boy threw up near the front and the kindest worker immediately took care of it. He was so sweet to my son and made it seem like it was no big deal! Thank you so much! Also the food was tasty!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing food! The seafood kabob is so good. The hummus is so creamy! The salads! The fresh bread!!?"}
{"text":"Obsessed! So clean and beautiful inside! Warm and welcoming staff. Delicious food! The falafel was amazing!! Chicken kebab perfectly seasoned and cooked! Love this place! Second time dining here and we will be back! Top notch Mediterranean food at a reasonable price. Extremely clean and beautifully presented food! Feels like a home cooked meal!"}
{"text":"Been to this Matthews spot a couple times now and have been impressed every time.  I usually go with a friend that orders for all of us and we just eat a big feast of delicious food - great for family style sharing, or if you want to bring a date, you can keep your plates to yourself (but what makes food fun is the sharing IMO).  Kabab-Je is tucked into the Sycamore Commons shopping center right off of HWY 51 and Independence Blvd.  It shares the same space as Best Buy and Costco, so the parking lot can get rather busy, but I've never had trouble finding a spot.  In the summers it's nice to relax (get coffee next door or ice cream). There's a good size fountain and benches in the parking lot to hang out around.  Staff and servers are very friendly and genuinely there to make your experience a good one.  They are ready with suggestions if you haven't dipped your feet in the cuisine before - or just make sure you are with Tonya P or and equivalent expert on food matters.  Falafel, hummus shawarma, and the fried cauliflower are just some of the many delicious things that you can get here.  Kababs are always tender and juicy.  Large dessert display for after, but we almost never have room for dessert since the meals are so filling.  Need to go back and try more menu items!  It's a big one, but don't be scuurred... just keep coming back to try new and exciting flavors."}
{"text":"Just an excellent experience, My buddy Lou took me here for the first time I had Kibbeh and Falafel. it was amazing ! The Grilled Kafta Sandwich is just awesome !

{"text":"Best hummus & fresh pita around! Everything that I've tried from here is delicious and the owner is amazing. He always makes sure all of his customers are taken care of and makes sure everything is being done correctly. The staff are very educated on the menu which is always appreciated and everything is really clean."}
{"text":"I was there for lunch. Great and prompt service. I had  falafel sandwich with a side of garlic sauce. I also had a tabbouleh salad. The only negative was that the tabbouleh salad had a bit too much tomato. Their prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"The food doesn't matter because the service was so hideous.  10 minutes for our to go order turned into 20 to 30 to 35.  There was a line piling behind us and things didn't get better.  Then to make it worse, once we got our food it was just meh.  Not great, not terrible, just meh and definitely not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great food, great service and great prices. Super friendly staff! The feta salad and chicken kebabs are my favorites and this place makes great shawarma too! Try the Turkish coffee too, very authentic!"}
{"text":"Date night!!! Couldn't have possibly been any better. It was packed the night we went. We waited about 10 minutes and got a small table way in the back. We looked over the menu and picked 4 small items. Every member of the staff we encountered was extremely friendly. The food. It. Was. Amazing. Every bite was perfect. This is my new favorite restaurant. We will definitely be back. Very soon."}
