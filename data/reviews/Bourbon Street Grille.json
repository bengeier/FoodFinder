{"text":"If this place wasn't on the  lake/channel it would be out of business.   Crap food, blah service.  Avoid.  Nice outside deck.  That is why it gets a star."}
{"text":"We had our Christmas party here. I'm giving four stars rather than five because when 200 people drop in, there never seems to be enough bartenders for us. I'm impressed with the improvements they made with the place in the last few years. It suited us as a group with the layout. There were quieter rooms for people who wanted to visit, a game room for people who wanted to play pool and the main bar for the rest of the party dwellers. The house DJ was good and kept the party rolling albeit a tad loud for conversation in that small area. There was a smoking balcony so the smokers didn't have to trudge out to the back 40 and could stay close to the main group. The food they served was good. We had a tight budget but, they didn't fail to deliver for us. From the previous reviews I was skeptical but, I was pleasantly surprised at the outcome but, more barkeeps for big parties next time and you shall get your final star."}
{"text":"Our group of 16 went there for \"Spagetti on the Board\". This is something new to me and to most of the group. We were seated at two 8' long tables. When we sat down, the spagetti was already on the table. When I say on the table though, I mean right on the table, no plates. There was a 6' long pile of pasta, sauce, and meatballs. You use a pasta fork to pull your food to the spot in front on you where a plate would normally sit. Use the provided fork to eat right off the table. Unconventional to say the least, but different and fun.  My wife who has Sicilian heritage, told us this was the traditional method of serving pasta in her grandfathers home in the old country.  Carafes of a table burgundy were included in the cost, as was a fresh salad (bowls were provided). Our server was attentive and prompt. Overall a fun time, I recommend it highly."}
{"text":"The food was good,  but the service was very slow. Good location,  nice facility.  Staff was nice, but there were too few of them to provide excellent service."}
{"text":"Wife and I were on date night in the area and hadn't been since it was the Musky. Figured they must have a Friday Fish fry so we let'er rip. Tale of two rooms once we got inside. In the \"dining\" room 2 of the 12 tables were occupied, in the bar area, it was bustling. We opted for the excitement and interaction of the bar. Soon realized the Bustle was just an office Christmas party, shortly after our drink order, they left for the party room and the bar was left with about 8 people. So much for bustle.  I ordered the Fish Fry Wife got the Nachos. Good service. Drinks were fast and good enough. Food came in reasonable time and hot. Nachos were HUGE. Pretty standard but not bad. I'll get to the down fall in a second. Fish was AYCE, and the first piece I got was a large, thin, flat piece, almost Walleye-ish, but haddock. I knew I was hungry and judging by the small scattering of regular issue bar fries that came with it, I knew I'd need more, so I put in a second order right away. The fish was tasty enough, not special but I could eat it every Friday.  When the second order came however, the haddock was two barrel shaped pieces. Why different from the first? Do they switch fish half-way through. The thicker fish didn't seem to cook all the way thorough, so not near as good as the first.  The biggest problem with the meal was the sides. Fish came with few fries, one 1oz container of Tartar sauce (?) and a dinner roll right out of the pack, with no butter!  The kicker came to the Nachos. Like I said HUGE. Came with one 1oz container of salsa. Wife ordered extra right away. Got 2 oz extra, and THEY CHARGED US $.30 !!!! C'mon guys. Really."}
{"text":"Thought how bad could it be and went despite the bad reviews. Well the service was atrocious and no one knew what was going on. Told us ten min wait for outside so we got a seat at the bar for a drink. After 20 min the bartender asked if we had a beeper and we didn't. She'd checked and said they knew we were here. So we ordered appetizers at the bar while we waited. The AC was not on and even the staff were complaining. Someone came to get us before our appetizers were done and I asked if the server would know to bring them. The hostess seemed very confused by this.   We were seated outside which is the main reason we came here. It took 10-15 min for our server to come back to get our order. The appetizers finally arrived and were quite good actually. We had the Cajun bang shrimp and spinach artichoke flatbread. The food and one of the summer cocktails were the best thing about the visit. Of course we had received our appetizers for 10 min before we got our drinks or silverware. We then ordered a burger to share.  While waiting over 30-40 min for this burger (which was good), there was a lady who commandeered and upper deck table so she could smoke. She didn't order anything and you could tell the previous people's dirty plates were there. No employee did anything about it but there were clearly people inside waiting  to be seated outside. Apparently there is a lower deck boaters can just sit at but can't smoke on so this lady was just yelling down to her friends. What got me was the restaurant's staff's complete lack of awareness.  Our outside waitress seemed pretty clueless and forgot our water too.   Overall it is so sad that place with an amazing location, outdoor seating and decent menu is such a disaster. If they had good management (or any), some training and good staff they could be such a success. The only reason they are in business in my opinion is the location.   Maybe someday we'll give them another chance and catch them on a better day."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has gotten such bad reviews. If their Groupon ploy was to build business, they managed to get a new customer. I live downtown Madison, and can say we don't have any restaurants/bars quite like this. The location is spectacular, the building is light, and the outdoor space is great.  We went for a spaghetti board -- I'm not a spaghetti connoisseur, but I would say that it was quite good! The noodles were cooked perfectly, the sauce tasted good (didn't seem jarred, but I can't be sure), and the meatballs were seasoned and done well. The Italian bread tasted like it had real butter! No complaints about our food.  We ordered drinks at the bar as we waited for our table (they had the chef set it up so that we didn't get us messy; considerate, in my opinion, plus the food was fresh) -- great prices on Turbo Dog! I think it may have been happy hour, but still. Also, service all around was good.  Even if the food/service would have been terrible, I would have come back for the location. Fun experience -- will definitely be back through the summer, especially if there's another pasta board."}
{"text":"Stopped in off the boat. This is one of the only bars along the lake and has a lot of decent outdoor seating. This is the extent of the reasons one would want to go to this disgusting place.  The service here is terrible! The tables are dirty, the pours are nasty weak (and overpriced), the waitstaff either does not care or is inexperienced.    The reason I'm bothering to write this review is out of concern for your well being. We were served severely undercooked chicken while here. With blood pouring out with the first and only bite. Upon tracking down the waitress and telling her about the raw chicken my dining companion was told \"oh, no! This happens all the time!\" Really! All the time!   EAT AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!"}
{"text":"Truly awful.  Our waitress was friendly- the rest- yuck.  Frozen (like what you buy at the store I am sure) Sweet potato fries and veggie burger.  The Philly roll made one person at our table ill.  The \"Chef\" and I do say that lightly, came out and ACTUALLY SAID TO US......  Are you sure it's not you?  Because I make the food fresh each day.  Yikes- horrible customer service- Never go back....."}
{"text":"The bartender I had mixed very weak drinks, for prices that are a bit higher than average here in town.  It's not a very comfortable bar to hang out in either.  It is very clean and has good parking though.  The food is acceptable, but they charge extra for soda refills, condiments etc - basically they up charge everything on you the whole time.  I suggest going somewhere with better food, drinks, and prices."}
{"text":"Started off with \"crab cakes\", which were more like bread crumb or cornmeal cakes.  There were tiny little strings of what may have been crab meat, couldn't really tell what it was, but if it was crab, it was almost non-existent.  Entree was a blackened catfish po boy for me, a \"yacht burger\" for the lady.  The catfish was decent if slightly under-cooked and limp, lettuce was soggy, and instead of being atop a crusty baguette like a proper po boy should be, it was served on an enriched hoagie roll, kind of like a glorified hot dog bun.  Jambalaya side was cold, like it just came out of the fridge that had to be re-heated.  The missus' burger was mediocre, also on an enriched bun a la Wendy's.  I'd be shocked if the burger patty didn't come out of the freezer.  Bottom line:  Prompt service, friendly staff, worst food I've had at any restaurant in recent memory."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, made me feel like I was back in the deep south. The po boy is always a classic choice, plus the fully stocked bar I wanted for nothing. Added bonus the prices are beyond reasonable. Expect thirty for two."}
{"text":"This is the first online review I've ever done of anything in my life, but the service and experience here was so atrocious I can't help myself. We came on a $50 dollar groupon. I will say, I have done this before and only purchased it this time because it was fun for everyone the first time around. This time, however , could not have been more different. We had a reservation at 7 and we didn't get seated until 8...and we weren't the only ones. The family who got seated just before us had even earlier reservations. They came and told us we would be seated momentarily a number of times and it never happened until we started really complaining,  which I hate to do but we had children with us who were starving and getting close to bedtime. They offered nothing for the wait (including an apology or even ackmowledgment that we had been waiting) and at the end they tried to charge us for extra meatballs and tax, despite the fact that I paid for a 104 dollar meal for 8 and only used and were served a 58 dollar meal for 5. Not one person was apologetic and when I asked about the bill misunderstanding, the server walked away stating \"oh my god, this is going to kill me\" as though we were being difficult for asking about the extra charges despite OVERPAYING for our meal and waiting an hour beyond our reservation time. Forget this place. I will never go back. I am understanding that waitstaff can't control the pace of the kitchen and dining room, but the lack of service and attentiveness was appalling. Everyone in our group agreed it was the worst restaurant experience we've had. Yelp won't let me select 0 stars so this 1 is an overstatement."}
{"text":"Why - WHY does it always smell like poop in here? Every time you walk in the front door, BAM in your nostrils. They need to hire a plumber to snake the stinkhole.   Poured drinks are metered through a system ensuring consistently mediocre beverages, so be prepared to drink beer. Nice ambiance outside of the poop smell, but cut the live music during the dinner hour please."}
{"text":"Dirty, dirty place. We thought it was drops of blood on the rug on our way in - turns out it was blobs of spaghetti sauce. Was still there about 45 minutes later when we were on our way out. Bathrooms are disgusting."}
{"text":"We had the spiaghetti on a board 4 of us it was unusual but good, comes with wine and bread the bread was nice and buttery and fresh and chewy just how I like it. Spaghetti sauce was great chef said he makes it himself pasta was just right and meat balls were very good. We will go back soon and anchious to try the fish fry."}
{"text":"We went to Bourbon Street Grille using a $25 groupon for the spaghetti board for four people. It came with all you could eat salad and garlic bread, wine and other beverages. We had two kids that thought it was hilarious to eat spaghetti off a big board. Our server was so nice and we had a great time. The pasta, sauce, and meatballs were delicious. The restaurant was clean, even the bathrooms. There were several other families dining and it looked like everyone was enjoying themselves. We played a few games in the arcade before and after dinner. Haven't seen Ms. Pacman in a while so that was fun too!  No complaints here!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday afternoon, not terribly busy.  Had to wait over an hour for our food, and the wait was not worth it. Had the Grilled Chicken Wrap, and the chicken was 1/2 raw.  Terrible.  Rest of our party's food was average to sub-par. Bathroom was disgusting - someone vomited in there - we told the waitress and she simply replied \"I'm not cleaning it - no way....\".    Would definitely not recommend this restaurant.  Find another nice place on the water - there are plenty in Madison."}
{"text":"We went to Bourbon Street Grille for the first time last night because I'd gotten a $25 restaurant.com coupon for $3 a while back.  The interior is actually quite nice, a least away from the bar- sort of a quasi-New Orleans theme.  We were promptly seated outside (friendly, efficient hostess), and waited for our server.  Although there was nothing technically wrong with the service, it was definitely of the bare minimum variety- yes, no, ok was all we could get out of her.    There were four of us- two ordered chicken caesars, which were good but were warm by the time we got them.  The chicken was still hot and the greens had started to wilt- bummer.  One ordered a french dip, good, but a little chewy; the fourth ordered jambalaya, which was a travesty at $12.00.  Cold, soupy and flavorless although the corn muffin was ok.  With 4 meals and 4 sodas, our bill was $31.00 after the $25.00 coupon.  I'd say it was a bad value.  However, I'd come back just for drinks and to sit outside and watch the boats go by, maybe get an order of fries.    Verdict- Bar=yes.  Restaurant=fail."}
{"text":"This place is awful. Now I know why every time we go by on the boat no one is out there - stay away! Horrible food, horrible service. Ordered a drink and the waitress forgot to bring it out until halfway through or meal, my cajun chicken panini had no cheese on it was over cooked and overkilled with cajun seasoning. Disgusting. My husbands pork was overcooked. Not to mention we waited 30 minutes for our food to come out and there were only 6 tables filled in the whole place. Never ever ever going back."}
{"text":"Good Service, terrible cajun food.  I got the Cajun Trio. It was so bad I couldn't eat it and had to order another meal.  The gumbo tasted like it had been burnt to the bottom of the pan while cooking, as it had a terrible burnt flavor. The jumbalia tasted freezer burnt and was little more than room temperature.. The etuffe' was kind of watery. None of the three even resembled authentic cajun cuisine.  I ordered fried chicken so I would have something to actually eat. It was greasy and salty but pretty good.   I did mention to the manager on my way our that the Cajun trio was not very good and I had to order more food as it was inedible. He seemed very nice and apologized. but he did not refund my money. He told me he would call me up and invite me back another week for a free meal. He never did. I even left a message for him but he never got back to me.  They had a chance to make it up to me, but I don't like having to buy two meals and only eat one.  I would not recommend it unless you are going there to just have a drink."}
{"text":"The first time I visited Bourbon Street was fall of 2010 and the service was horrible.  My friends and I were sitting on the upstairs outdoor level and more often than not had to go to the bar to get drinks in spite of having a server.    I visited this past weekend and things were smoother.  It seems they are making an effort to improve on their service.  A manager came around asking people if they'd been helped.  Still, it took ten minutes to get someone to acknowledge my party, so, not great.  There was a feedback form given to us to fill out after eating, too.  The food was pretty good.  A member of my party was extremely pleased with his ahi tuna sandwich and the gumbo.  I enjoyed a \"new awlins' wrap, although I refused to say 'awlins' when I ordered.  The sweet potato fries were just the frozen variety warmed up, so that was a tad disappointing, but I enjoyed them.  The view overlooking the water is great, especially with nice warm weather.  Bourbon has room for improvement, but if you want to take a gamble with service or its not that important, give it a shot."}
{"text":"I saw the other reviews and thought, hmm can't be too bad three stars... How wrong I was. Food is disgusting and they served me expired beer. This could be an amazing place, view is great, great live music, but the service, hygiene and quality of food was beyond disgusting. I am surprised the department of health does not shit them down there was so much bird shit on the seats it didn't seem safe to eat there... And one look into the kitchen/bar is enough to turn anyone off from going to a reassurance again. Do not come here to eat or drink. The river view and music are the only good things."}
{"text":"I enjoy how the Bourbon Street Grille is on the water, and I have eaten here, now fairly unfortunately, with my family on several occasions for this reason.  However, the experience was consistently underwhelming each time.  The service is slow as molasses after 6pm, jumbling orders, forgetting drinks, etc.  When you finally get the food, sometimes it is cold, sometimes it is missing items, and generally is not presented professionally, or deserving of the price.  When you eat it, most of the dishes are too spicy, and not in a full-bodied, cajun way, but in a vinegary, salty way. The etouffe was thin and had little flavor.  The jambalaya was spicy and had no depth to it, rather it had more of a chili in a can flavor.  The soups were overdone and a bit burnt, I believe.  The sandwiches came out on dry bread with limp mushrooms, onions, and fries.  The location is nice, and the experience is manageable, but it misses the mark in service and food."}
{"text":"We called ahead as it was late evening and they said \"Still serving come on over.\"   Salad bar was nearly empty and they wouldn't add anything, specialty was ribs and they only had 2 half racks (but didn't tell the staff until we had all ordered).  My jambalaya was the worst I've had - 5 nice shrimp in a watery very spicy sauce, no sausage, no ham, cold rice.  Ribs were just warm, when a friend was asked if he wanted more fish it took 10 minutes as did the veggy side dishes (they came after we finished the meal)."}
{"text":"I ate here on the day after Christmas and found the place dead around 4pm. I thus got just what I hoped for, lightning quick service as soon as I sat at the bar. I got the blackened chicken po boy with sautéed mushrooms and onions and a side of sweet tater fries. This is a hunk of a sandwhich let me tell you now! Messy but delicious start to end. I also got the \"Cajun Trio\" which is a smaller portion of cup size classic creole soups. Jambalaya, Etuffe', and Gumbo. All have a nice kick to them so get ready for the nose to start running folks! Each one has a unique and distinct flavor all its own so do try this trio option to sample all 3. Your missing out otherwise.  Prices are great here from what I saw with $19 being the most pricey item. All the staple Cajun items seemed to be on the menu so I would state this as a legit place to get your spicy food fix on during these chilly days of winter.   Kudos to the 11 TV's they have in the main (full)bar and dining area to do some prime sports viewing as well!"}
{"text":"We had the french dip, pecan encrusted catfish, and sweet potato fries, all of which were great.  We sat in the separate, closed off, dining room which was perfect ... we could still hear the live music, but also have a nice conversation.  Chaz (our server) did a great job and was very courteous."}
{"text":"Great location, the service was quick and friendly, the food was fine.  Nothing special, but a beautiful view!"}
{"text":"Very cool view but wow the service is absolutely terrible. Sandwiches take hours. If you're going there, get the salad bar..."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time tonight and loved it.  We sat out on the patio and it was wonderful.  We both had the fish fry and it was FABULOUS.  Our waitress was great, I think her name was Sarah!  Great prices!"}
{"text":"I love Bourban street! The staff are always warm and welcoming, they have a fantastic outdoor deck, and rooftop bar!  Prices are reasonable , featuring standard bar fair and New Orleans options! My only gripe is.... It takes awhile. If you order a bottle of beer, it might be 5 minutes before you see it. Tonight we ordered chicken strips and fries and it was a good 45 minutes before we saw them. The servers are great, I think the issue is deeper in house! I'm not sure, but as long as you order early... You'll be fine! They have a great deep fried fish filet, sadly they only serve it on Fridays.... Even if you ask any other night of the week! They will tell you no! Makes me sad, I would come several nights a week, just for that fish! But even with a couple bumps, it's a fun spot we enjoy watching the constant boat parade while enjoying a cold beverage!"}
{"text":"The appeal of this place is definitely their outdoor patio.  It is pretty awesome as it sits on a lake and is right in front of a docking pier.  There are three levels to the their patio.  First level allows you to sit pretty close to the water; great view. The second level gives a great view of the houses and is great for geese watching. I haven't been to the third level yet but that one is on the roof and seems pretty cool too.  The service at this place is pretty standard.  The staff have been trained to address you right way which is great.  They do however lack the type of excitement that builds rapport.  If they were a bit more excited I think it would definitely make for a more enjoyable experience.  They also have decent beers on tap.  Not a big beer drinker but I've never heard any complaints from the man.  One would think however that they would have a better tropical drink menu with things the NOLA is famous for like Hurricanes.   Lastly, the food.  I got food for first time on 7/3/2014.  It was okay.  I ordered the lunch portion of the gumbo.  This was well priced at $9.  The man ordered the Louisiana sampler trio.  I felt that my meal could have used a bit more kick.  Also the rice was par boiled instead of the regular white rice you find at southern restaurants.  The sampler platter came with gumbo, jambalaya and shrimp étouffée.  The server didn't go over which was which but there was one that was really great; nice and spicy.  The other two were just meh.  This place has some really just terrible reviews but I am glad that found this place.  I am a fan of all places that have great patios and this is definitely one of the best!  Such a great view.  All you need is great company to enjoy yourself here!"}
{"text":"Had the Hard Shell Taco salad with Chicken, it was very fresh and tasty. Definately would order again !"}
{"text":"Let's give this place a 2.5 overall in the winter.  The summer is completely different because you can lounge on one of the three great patios and gaze at the Yahara river. In the winter, ambiance is bleak, cheap too bright sports bar. Crawfish soup is amazing!! Catfish is disgusting. Staff is friendly enough and willing to help if there's an issue- and believe me if you order the catfish, there will be one."}
{"text":"A-OK it is. Good service. Nice view on the outdoor deck. Good food. Decent prices.  The best thing they have going for them is the outdoor seating. Very enjoyable. The food is average although they have an above average menu with some interesting items. I had a shrimp wrap that was very good and appreciated that for a bar they had some healthier options. Four stars for this.  I really need to go here a few more times to get a feel for the service and management. But for now it is A-OK."}
{"text":"After getting stranded in a storm while biking, a friend and I ended up here as refuge until the storm passed. We were pretty disappointed on all fronts.  The worst aspect was the service: the dining room was about 3/4 full, but our waitress was difficult to find when we were ready to order and when we wanted the check.  The atmosphere was also pretty terrible. In addition to the tacky decorations and awkward floor layout (some tables in the bar area, some in the recreation area, nothing really aligned), the other patrons that were there were loud and rude. I guess this is Madison's version of a dive bar?  The food had no redeeming quality. My friend got the $9 Caesar salad, which consisted of a minimal amount of romaine lettuce and Caesar dressing. Not even croutons?! For $9, I expect at least some veggies or toppings on the salad. Note that for $3 more, you can get chicken on top, but I wouldn't hold my breath.  I got sweet potato fries which were ok, but were clearly frozen.  Avoid at all costs unless this place cleans up their act."}
{"text":"Boating today in Madison and stopped here for lunch.  Nice and sunny on the deck. The food sounded great.  I got the shrimp po boy, two others in our party got the tuna steak sandwich and another got the chicken panini.  All of us took our first few bites and each said, \"It's okay.\"  The chicken in the panini was a bit too tough, the tuna steak was overcooked and the po boy was five pieces of shrimp, lettuce and tomato in a big, fat white bread bun.  My sweet potato fries had too much batter on them to make them crispy.  Frozen from a bag?  Seemed to be.  What ever happened to actual fries?  Now they add all of this junk on the outside to make them better?  Not in my opinion.  Next time we're boating the lakes in Mad-town, we will skip Bourbon Street Grille and head to the Green Lantern."}
{"text":"The food we had was OK, but they do seem to rely on a lot on pre-processed foods. The cheese on the nachos is a canned sauce.The salsa was neither fresh nor ample. The black bean burger is the same morningstar farms black bean burger in our freezer. The signs about baggy pants are off-putting. The view from the outdoor dining area is a parade of boats and kayaks, which is lovely."}
{"text":"I've had great meals here before. Usually the prime rib is superb, but tonight's iteration was rather so-so. I guess it's an up and down place without consistency."}
{"text":"If you do have to eat here.... Stick to something basic. They can't even cook a hamburger properly. I have had more of the speciality items and I've learned my lesson.  Recently went back after I vowed never to go back to this place but I got suckered in by a living social deal. Nothing's changed.  Still garbage.  Too bad - it's a nice place, great river front access in the summer.  In the right hands it could work."}
{"text":"Just got home from Bourbon St. Grille.  It was horrible.  I ordered the \"Cajun Trio\".  My husband ordered the pecan catfish.  The \"Cajun Trio\" was disgusting.  Absolutely disgusting.  Chunks of rubbery chicken skin disgusting.  To call that Cajun is a travesty.  My husbands pecan crusted fish was mushy, and just gross.  His \"red beans & rice\" side dish was literally canned re-fried beans mixed with rice.  I don't think anyone who works in that kitchen has ever had real Cajun food.  Oh, and let's not forget my \"Cajun Trio\" was served in a plastic Dollar Store dish.  Seriously. Presentation was a joke.  Completely disappointing.  What a waste of a beautiful space.  Do not waste your money or time."}
