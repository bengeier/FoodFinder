{"text":"The waitress, Lisa, was rude. We were in town to close on a real estate sale, stopped here after getting off the freeway. Not being familiar with their food, I ordered the chicken paprika dinner. The menu stated you could order potatoes, any kind, salad, vegetable, soup and salad. I ordered the dinner but was told I couldn't get a potato with the dinner, I never received my salad, the waitress asked if I wanted white or dark meat, I thought the dinner came with shredded chicken not a big piece of chicken which she could have explained, No refills on drinks, ok dinner.  Service was rude. rolls were nasty, all smashed. Even my granddaughter couldn't believe how rude she was. We were a party of three, tired and thirsty, not a good experience. As a business owner. I wouldn't let one of my employees treat customers the way she did."}
{"text":"A good sit down diner kind of restaurant. The food was good and the staff was nice enough. No complaints really."}
{"text":"A great change of pace from chain restaurants. I recommend eating here. its like an old time country diner."}
