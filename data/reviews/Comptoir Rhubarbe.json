{"text":"Incredible cafe from brunch with the pastries from patisserie rhubarbe.   I got a special which had thinly sliced gravlox with ricotta, red cabbage and herbs. It was a perfect light brunch, and came with a bacon and cheese scone. I loved the breakfast, and the environment. Beautiful wallpaper and adorable flowers on each table. Also had great coffee!   My friends for the grilled cheese that you dip in a soft boiled egg and the French toast that was made of a croissant. One of my favorite brunches!!"}
{"text":"Excellent petit déjeuner, tout en finesse. J'ai beaucoup apprécié le service, l'originalité des plats et la présentation."}
{"text":"Accueil chaleureux, service sympathique et professionnel! Resto intime, atmosphère relax. Du potage au dessert tout est apprêté avec goût et chacune des composantes des plats sont cuites parfaitement! Pour un dîner ou un brunch qui correspond à l'idée qu'on se fait de qualité/prix on frappe dans le mille!!! Bon appétit!"}
{"text":"Came for brunch. Used to hit up this spot when it was still called \"pâtisserie rhubarb.\" The Pastry shop has been moved down the street, but you can still get the brunch fare and more at the newly named \"comptoir rhubarb\"   In contrast to the old style menu where you would get a scone, main plate, drink, and dessert, the new menu proposes ordering multiple plates. The number of options have been increased, and plate range from 6-8$, a VERY reasonable price given the quality!! We got 2 plates each along with coffees.   Would recommend calling and reserving ahead. Best for small groups ideally 2 or 4.   Excited to come for happy hour and try their \"bar salée\" menu, cocktails, and private import wine list !!"}
