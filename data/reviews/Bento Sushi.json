{"text":"Average sushi. Bento box are ok. Beer was not cold at all. Average for airport food and not cheap."}
{"text":"I think this is called Bento Sushi in the core shopping mall food court. It was ok except for I got the worst shits ever, no joke. Hopefully they will regulate the coolers more often or wash their hands more frequently."}
{"text":"This is pretty standard airport sushi. The fish is fresh and rolls made quickly on site. It's very much a grab and go place... perfect if you're trying to catch a flight where there is no meal. The taste is a below meh but I gave the place two stars because the food in T1 is terrible and this is one of the better options."}
{"text":"Skip the ramen it looks like itchiban and tastes like they forgot the flavour packet. Airport food is always challenging but to charge 15$ for this travesty is hard to justify. 

Sushi looked okay expect grocery store quality. Butthe grab and go is a nice option."}
{"text":"Airport pricing, but you knew that. Agree the sushi seemed on par with grocery store quality, but my kiddo loves a CA roll, so it's kinda hard to mess that up. It looked fresh and he had zero complaints. Miso was tasty and comforting, no tofu in either bowl, but whatever. It was tasty. 

The pork Udon was pretty amazing. The broth was delightful and just spicy enough to provide some heat, without being overpowering. The noodles were good consistency. The meat was a surprisingly good sized portion and it was tender as well as tasty. 

Service was quick, not many seats."}
{"text":"Overpriced but mediocre sushi. Selection was limited. I had the salmon + avocado roll for $12.99 (4 salmon nigiri, 6 roll pieces) and It was just okayed. Their cashier seriously need some customer service training. I asked for a bottle of water, instead of saying \"would you like Dasani or Evian?\" She said \"which one?\" Assuming that I know what  products they carry."}
{"text":"OK for airport I suppose. Rolls are premade and in a fridge unit if you want to grab and go. Had the Bento box beef with California rolls. Meat was premade too. Beef was about an a ounce of finely shredded meat. Guy opened one of the boxes from the fridge to grab the California rolls. Price was $17. If you want some miso soup with that it is another $4."}
{"text":"Bento Sushi... it's sushi from a mall food court.  It's fine by mall food court standards.  I didn't care for the seaweed salad.  The rice on the salmon avocado rolls was a bit chewy.  Again, it's mall food court food, so the expectations have to be quite low.  Okay... is the best was to describe..."}
{"text":"~ Airport sushi stop ~

The first thing you notice is the small option pool of dishes to choose from. While sushi has some variation, the main menu is essentially a bowl or noodles. I ordered a suriyaki beef bowl that came with sticky rice and vegetables, glazed with teriyaki sauce. The first surprising thing I noticed is how soft and tender the beef was. Very sweet, melt sin your mouth with the sauce, and the sticky rice makes it even better. You all know me, I love me some rice. The chicken was soft as well, but did not taste as good as the beef. It was just a bit too soft for me, and came off a bit chewy.

Drinks are basic option, from soda to water, as well as green tea. The seating is small and compact, but hey, it's an airport. Not to your surprise yet again, the prices are high, but hey, it's still an airport."}
{"text":"$17.00 bento. So So chicken teriyaki on rice that's seen better days. 3 California rolls, 1 gyoza. some kind of salad.  I didn't mind the price but seemed very skimpy on the quantity.  Bypass next time.  Onboard the AC flight would have been better."}
{"text":"This is about their alcohol specifically. Their large sign says cold beer and sake. When I tried to order sake they said they don't serve sake. Then I directed them to the large signage and they repeated what they said before. Not recommended to try to have sake at this location."}
{"text":"Ugh.  I ordered the Bento Box with beef.  The beef was cooked then slathered in gooey sauce.  California roll (only option available) was tasteless and the rice mushy.  Single gyoza had no sauce and the dressing on the salad wasn't very good.  Overall it was a pretty gross meal and I threw out more than half then ate my son's teenburger leftovers for lunch instead."}
{"text":"I just paid $26 for one sushi roll, a seaweed salad, and a miso soup. This is offensive given the low quality. Shameful."}
{"text":"didn't have much time nor option so stopped here and tried the donburi bowl with salmon. Priced are higher like any other place, but the plate was pretty tasteless, the teriyaki sauce was pretty bland so had to add some soy sauce. The donburi came with brown rice, salmon, lettuce and the lamest onion. Forgettable."}
{"text":"I mean, I'm not sure what part of me, the adventurous or the stupid, screamed \"YES!\" when I saw Bento Sushi. Who thinks airport sushi is a good idea? I don't think airport sushi is a good idea, but I'm currently on a two-hour layover between Cleveland and Fredericton and I'm hungry. That said, I should have gone to Timmy Ho's because this place ran me way more than a tooney. 

Quality is just slightly below grocery store sushi--dense rice, super chilled from refrigeration, pale salmon. I got an assortment of California rolls, salmon sushi, and ebi in one container. It was $15 CAD, and my water was $5. I hope my company isn't upset with my expense report. 

The woman who helped me was very nice, offering me a cold bottle of water as opposed to the warm bottle I'd picked up from their shelf. 

Sushi taste was nothing exciting, but I'm happy to report that I'm experiencing no intestinal distress. Happily waiting for my plane to take off--lighter in the wallet, slightly heavier in the stomach. This place will do in a pinch, and that's really all I ever need from an airport stop. Would be three stars if it weren't so expensive."}
