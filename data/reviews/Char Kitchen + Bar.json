{"text":"Spinach salad was so fresh and good.  I had the filet and it was excellent.  We will definitely be going back.  Great dining option in the PV/Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"Should have tried this restaurant a long time ago! Outstanding food, plenty of choices, and very welcoming environment and service.

We had the mezze appetizer which was fresh, plentiful and tasty. Entree was a veggie wrap with side of coleslaw. Outstanding, well prepared and good portions.

We will be regulars from now on. Lots more entrees to try. 
Owner is friendly, has great stories and is passionate about his business.  Recommend this to all, just leave one seat for me."}
{"text":"Solid, clean food. Everything made in house.  Bar is a hidden gem, have some of the best cocktails in a town over-saturated with places that claim to make craft drinks."}
{"text":"Great new option for the Scottsdale-Lincoln Road corridor...we are hoping this Mediterranean-focused casual spot gets some local love as an addition to the well-established other restaurants at Hilton Village. There's an interesting selection of apps, including sricha grilled chicken on skewers, a lovely hummus platter & more. Salads include a Greek style nicely done w a handful of other options. The lamb gyro was very tasty- crammed w lean slices of smoky meat, fresh veggies & creamy tzaziki sauce. The pita was soft & lightly grilled yum. Service was efficient & friendly. A black board notes seasonal drink specials including creative renditions of the mule. Try it a few times to sample the entree skewers, the rather unique lamb burger and creative sides."}
{"text":"Our second visit to Char. The Rosemary Chicken was a wonderful dish. Grilled chicken breast with a Mediterranean touch. Light drizzle of balsamic vinegar to finish. 

A nice friendly feel as we watched the staff assist three generations of one family get settled in, including an infant, with helpful suggestions of menu items for their other child.

Jennifer was pleased to accommodate our request to split our salad and main. Perfect."}
{"text":"Great food. There falafel bites, grape leaves and Sriracha chicken skewers were amazing"}
{"text":"We live nearby and have always wondered about this place. My parents were visiting and we decided to order in (6 total including 2 young kids). Everyone got something different and everyone enjoyed it! It is not heavy, flavorful and just delicious. My son really loved the hummus and my husband had the chicken kabobs, I got the steak and we split the Santorini salad. The salad is amazing. The dressing.. yum. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great food, great patio, great atmosphere. Locally sourced foods and grass fed meats!  Highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Now this was a hit! Everyone in our party was well satisfied with their tasty choices. The lamb burger really is as great as they say, and the Mediterranean offerings are all first class. No wonder this place is hopping all winter long. Summertime is quieter but you'll get the same good service and exceptionally good food. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Now this was a find! Great wait staff, better food, amazing back story. A family restaurant hosted by Pjetër, new to Scottsdale (\"my kids bribed me to follow them out here\"), by way of Detroit, and before that long stay -- New York, New Jersey, Connecticut...and the Montenegrin side of Albania!
My friend suggested the four of us go to Char, largely because its food roots are Albanian and I'm soon heading out for 2+ years in the Peace Corps in Albania. We were in luck. The Farmer's Market kale and quinoa salads -- one with shrimp, the Tuscan Chicken wrap, the lamb gyro, all led off by the crispy calamari!!! and the wonderful Abbey Lee tomatoes (with extra Feta) were extremely well prepared and delicious. If this is anything like Albanian food, I'm going to love my time in the old country!
Pjetër was very kind to sharpen up my sloppy pronunciations of rudimentary Shqip and shared some insights into the Balkins' history.
Such a treasure, \"me jetë të gjatë!\"."}
{"text":"Great food! I had a lamb burger which was delicious. The vegie side was a mix of red peepers, squash, broccoli and onions sauteed in oil. Really great! We definitely will go back ."}
{"text":"We did the take out and it was cold,  the portions were small, the hummus came without bread.  I have to say I would never go back or order again.  Four of us waited one hour and spent $159.00 for awful dried out chicken.  We called manager and she spoke to owner and she gave us a $50.00 gift certificate which I will donate to the homeless.  I never review like this but had to display my feelings.  ....  just an update,  I never received the gift certificate."}
{"text":"This place gets five stars for its lovely, quiet, relaxed atmosphere and attentive service. The menu includes all the great Mediterranean standards--kebabs, dolmades, felafel, tsatsiki-- all adeptly prepared. It's not the spiciest or most adventurous food around but it's reliably prepared and your servers will do their best to ensure that you enjoy your meal.

We were there on Friday evening, having an impromptu birthday gathering. When our host sensed what we were there for, he put us in the most charming table toward the back--and even arranged a separate table for presents on the spot!

Great experience. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"We accidentally came in here because of google maps and I couldn't be happier! The food was absolutely amazing and the owner was so kind and always made sure we were doing alright! Service was great and I really can't stress how good the food was! All the food was priced adequately and so were their drink selections! Definitely a place we will be visiting again!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for lunch on a Saturday about mid day.  Place was not busy so we were greeted and allowed to sit anywhere.  The place was very nice and our server was very nice.

My wife had the chicken caesar wrap which she loved.  It was large enough where I was able to have her \"left overs\" and I agree - chicken was fresh and grilled perfectly.  The caesar dressing was excellent.  I had the Mediterranean steak wrap.  Steak was tasty and cooked to perfection.  Both of us had fries with the wraps... ok, not the healthiest of choices, but they were good too.  Thin cut fries with plenty of salt... maybe too salty for some?

My wife is hesitant to try new places unlike me... but she said was very pleased and would love to come back again!  The best stamp of approval!  

Price was about average for the location.  

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Place was great. I would definitely come back. They have good quality grass fed lamb :)"}
{"text":"Lemon soup is a must try.  The chicken kabob, I'm not sure why, but just tasted better than any kabob I've had. Maybe their preparation. And the Cypress Salad, very very good. I highly recommend it. 

Oh, and I'd be remiss if I didn't give a shout to Stephanie. She is cute, super friendly and did not steer us wrong!!  Thank you Stephanie!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants.  Food always good. Quiet, so I hear across the table. The servers are always friendly and attentive.  Try the lamb burger or Reuben with roasted potatoes as your side dish, the best."}
{"text":"Going to Char was a last minute decision looking for a Saturday Happy Hour. What a pleasant surprise! The ambiance is very cool, the food is incredible and the service is impeccable. We settled in at the bar as usual and met Kelly - one of the best and most personable bartenders we've met. She gave us amazing recommendations - Sriracha Chicken Skewers on Basmati Rice were very good, Burger Sliders we're perfectly charred (reminded us of White Castle burgers but higher end) and the Chicken Lemon Rice soup was steaming hot and beyond delicious. This is a fantastic neighborhood go-to place that we will definitely visit often!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is right in my neighborhood and has changed hands a few times. Tonight was the third time I came into Char and every time I've left happy, full, and impressed. Their chicken is amazing, tender and juicy. Both the Pol sandwich as well as the chicken kebabs are fantastic. Their lamb gyro is quite tasty, I credit it to their delicious tzatziki. I definitely would suggest this restaurant to someone who is not wanting to wait the hour lunch rush at Houstons in the same parking lot."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what star rating to give since I didn't even actually dine there.  Let me explain.  When we walked in the one waiter didn't even acknowledge us to seat us. We asked to be seated and he seemed to be annoyed. Finally seated us. No menus and walked away and didn't come back to at least take a drink order.  Finally my mom got up and asked him for water.  He brought back just one for the seven of us. and walked away.  Still no menus.  I flagged him down again and asked for menus.  When he came back with them I asked if they were short handed. He told me no but a party of seven should have called in advance.  He basically said it was our fault that we were receiving little to no service.   We decided it was time to jut leave.  Never did that before but things were going in the wrong direction.  I hope they work on their service issues because I was happy to try a Mediterranean restaurant in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I sat at the bar, I was not impressed. Grossly overpriced with mediocre service. Bartender slammed my beverage down on the bar so loudly I honestly had to look at the bottom of the glass to check for cracks! Nothing about his demeanor showed any sign of giving a sh*t. He wasn't rude, he just seemed vapid. 

Food: The $14 Mediterranean steak wrap was pretty good, but not $14's good. Felt like I could've gotten the same thing at a sports bar for 9 bucks. The sauteed veggies were a mixture of zucchini, squash, TONS of green bell peppers & a few slivers of red onion served in a small cast iron looking dipping tray I'd expect to see a spinach artichoke dip served in. The veggies were good, too much oil though & no hint of any seasoning. I also would've liked to see more grill marks on them. Only a few pieces did & those ones had the best texture & were the best tasting. 

Atmosphere: Looked great, actually wasn't! I clearly made the choice to sit at the wrong end of the bar. An older gentlemen couldn't stop dropping F- bombs while using words incorrectly while trying to blank his own blank.  Astonishingly, the woman he was with only seemed mildly embarrassed when he started yelling part of his story in a foreign language quite loudly. Fortunately this was as I was at the point of settling up my tab. It really astonishes me when folks don't have the ability to control their volume. I could literally hear everything he said, even when he started talking \"quietly\" to appease his guest.

For the final act a decent sized dog ran past me into the restaurant as I was walking out.  The reaction of the owner was almost as if he was mad at the unleashed pup for running towards food as opposed to being embarrassed that he let his dog run into a business. He nonchalantly walked towards the restaurant like it wasn't BS that his dog just ran into an expensive restaurant. The entire evening was just off from start to finish."}
{"text":"We went here for an early dinner on a Saturday. It was off time so we were essentially the only diners in the place. Very clean & simply elegant decor. Friendly & efficient staff. I had a glass of Pinot and the Lamb Gyro w/coleslaw. Both were good. Not great but good bar & grill food. My boyfriend got the steak wrap w/coleslaw. Same reaction very good not the best, but good. We'd go again if in the area, but not as a specific destination. Worth your while to try."}
{"text":"If one thing is hard to find in the valley, it's expertly made middle eastern food.

Char Kitchen delivers and then some on their offerings.

The happy hour menu is full of goodies- we had 2 items....

Grape Leaves- Fresh, delicious and seasoned perfectly.  Served with a side of \"goddess sauce\", it actually adds another dimension to the flavor.  Definitely a must try

Meeze platter- a huge generous portion of homemade hummus, which was creamy and so delicious.  Cut up cucumbers and carrots were included with sides of tzatziki  and red pepper chutney.  Pita was fresh as well and heated nicely.

Now for the desserts.....

Rice pudding- homemade of course and just the right amount of sweetness with raising and cinnamon.  One of the best I've had in the valley.

Baklava- Again homemade with walnuts.  Nicely done, I prefer a bit more of honey but that is subjective to the individual.

Service was friendly and helpful.  Worthy of 5 stars all day!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is AAHMAZING here!! I have honestly never had a bad meal, and I think we have tried the entire menu. Great atmosphere, superb bar-tending by Chad, Liz and Fran. Do not miss this place!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to this restaurant. (We were looking for the restaurant that preceded it in that space.) We had a good experience.  There are interesting cocktails and we each had one.  I didn't care for mine but still was glad to have tried it. My wife enjoyed hers and also had a Moscow Mule.  I had a good red. I had the sliders which were excellent.  My wife had the patty melt and fries and also enjoyed it. Service was decent though not great. We came in and waited for a few minutes to be noticed and seated. There was a problem with ingredients for my drink. Would we go back?  Definitely."}
{"text":"Been here twice in two days.  Food is great and service is excellent.  Will be back many times!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my mom and 3 sisters. Delicious food and great service! Raving from all 5 of us. No wait, great and quick service and everything was delicious!!! Fries were crispy and yummy. We tried wraps, gyros, salads and sandwiches and all of them were great! Definitely would recommend!!"}
{"text":"After a horrible experience from Houston's across the street, which I personally have been to since I was 10. We walked over to Char and the restaurant was outstanding. The food, staff, the ambience... LOVED IT. I recommend ordering the fish or beef selection they offer. Quite tasty and fantastic quality. See you again Saturday!"}
{"text":"Delicious middle eastern fare.  We were in a rush but loved the pita wrap and burger.  So good."}
{"text":"Char was taken over by binks, it was a really cool spot when I was inside. So far I've had the spinach salad and the kale and both were delicious. However, I do want to have a dine in experience but since I have been limited on time, I've gotten take out and they have been really good."}
{"text":"Oh My God INCREDIBLE!  Polly, Kelly and Peter they make you feel like family. Great food, great cocktails and the best rice pudding and baklava I've had in years. This is the TO GO place for great food in a relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"We stopped in this week for dinner and had a great visit!  The staff was very welcoming and friendly (and checked up on us the appropriate amount of times with genuine concern), the decor is quite nice (comfortable and cozy) and the food was incredible.  We started with the siracha chicken skewers over rice...wow, spicy, but so good!  I had the lamb gyro with a side of rice for my entree...seriously the best gyro I have ever tasted - the lamb was so tender and the pita was so fluffy!  We will definitely be back because I am already craving that gyro."}
{"text":"Loved the food; second time I've been there and neither time disappointed!  The service is a bit slow (both times).  Hopefully they get that part ironed out; I'd hate to see it fail."}
{"text":"Went in for dinner and everything was great! Shrimp skewers were awesome! Shrimp were big and tastey! Menu needs a little work, not sure what but everything we had was delicious. Recommend!"}
{"text":"Mind blowingly rude service and I work in the restaurant services industry so I try my best to be understanding. The one male server felt sorry for me and walked over to help me while the bartender just sat there chatting with other patrons. I think he was even surprised."}
{"text":"Went for an early dinner on a Tuesday night.  The food was of high quality and very tasty.  The decor was modern rustic and service was perfect.  We enjoyed the salad and wraps.  My 10 year old asked to come back again.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Beautiful little restaurant with a nice patio and bar. A great view of the mountains at sunset. The service was friendly as were the other patrons. The food everyone was getting looked delicious. We only had an appetizer, which was good too. They have a decent happy hour and I would try it again!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on Saturday night for the first time. We started with the chicken skewers which were very tasty. Would definitely order them again. We also had the Palo sandwich and the Mediterranean steak wrap. The ingredients inside the palo sandwich were delicious, but the bun was way too large. Every time I bit into the sandwich it tasted like it was all bun. The steak wrap was pretty good, it included an eggplant spread inside the wrap which was really good. The fries weren't great, but good. The grilled vegetables were really good. I thought the price of the food was on par with what we received. I will be stopping by again."}
{"text":"Excellent food, well served and reasonably priced.  The restaurant is very nicely appointed, and you can actually have a conversation without having to yell.  It's become our \"go to\" place to eat!"}
{"text":"Food was adequate but overall experience was seriously lacking. Our poor server seemed to be doing the job of five people. Orders got mixed up in the kitchen. When the missing food cake out, it was clear it had been rushed- crunchy rice and soggy grape leaves. It took a LONG time to process our checks or return them to us after we gave them our payment method. A gentleman who I assume to be the owner (who was not dressed professionally at all) just seemed to wander around aimlessly, not helping while the server/hostess/bartender was running around frantic.  When he finally came to our table after we waited 20 min for our checks, he stated that had he known we were \"in a hurry\" he would have processed our checks sooner. Then, rather go do it, he hunted down our waitress who was still overloaded to do it."}
{"text":"Really good food service was a bit slow even though me and my wife came in last minute but they had no problem with seating us. Quality food and a good vibe. Owner sits in the back on his laptop all day"}
{"text":"Char Kitchen and Bar recently opened and serves American Food laced with touches of the Mediterranean and Europe. The atmosphere is sort of Modern Farmhouse style with comfortable booths and also tables.

We started with the Chicken Lollis (3@$9.00). They quite small but were cooked just so and were delicious. The Chicken was covered with a Pomegranate, Harrisa BBQ sauce with Feta Cheese and Pickled Onions. The Harrisa was barely used so I didn't taste it but still the Lollis were very tasty.

For my meal I had the small Santorini Salad with added Chicken. All the vegetables were nice and fresh. The Pink Goddess Dressing was unusual but tasty and the white meat chicken breast was very good with a nice CHAR on it. I thought it was generous in size considering that I ordered a small size salad. ($7+$5)

My husband had the Choban Lamb Burger ($13.). They prepared it just how he asked and he said it was a very delicious burger with what he thought was a Greek kind of seasoning and a yummy CHARred tomato Chutney. The side order were fingerling potatoes that had creamy interiors and were seasoned with fried herbs.

All the food we tried was delicious and service was really great too! It was our servers first day and she already knew the menu well enough to answer any question we had.

This is a nice restaurant that I will go back to."}
{"text":"Very good food. Service is very slow. We needed to remind waiter several times for different items. Took 10 minutes before we were acknowledged."}
{"text":"New favorite.  You feel welcomed and wanted.  Comfy.  Casual.  Fair prices... Especially before 6:00 happy hour ends ($4 vs $7 beer for example).  Pete the owner has it right.  If you get Chad the barkeep you scored.  He's a true friendly professional.  Food is sooo tasty... Master chef.  Really cool bar and restaurant areas.  More stars if I could."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Super friendly owner ship, great food, great drinks. A must if you're in walking distance. A great recommend for those curious."}
{"text":"Excellent brunch on weekends! Great quality, service,  and flavor.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Ambiance: Modern and upscale restaurant that is par for course in this part of Scottsdale. The vibe is a cross between a Gastropub and modern Mediterranean Restaurant. I really appreciate that the bar is physically separated from the dining room. This allows a more intimate setting for those that want to enjoy their dinner without flat screens showing the latest ESPN replays.  Patrons are all ages. Good music playing at a appropriate volume. Perfect for a date or business dinner. Seating options for pairs as well as groups.

Food: Excellent prepared burgers and salads that would remind one of a gastropub. There are chicken/steak skewers with tzatziki for those in favor of Mediterranean. 

Service: I love new restaurants because there is still a zeal for customer service. We were seated promptly. Both our server and manager checked in on us to make sure we were happy.

Price: On the higher side but par for course for this part of town.

Overall: A great bar/grill with a unique Mediterranean twist."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Tracy Chapman - Fast Car)

You gotta try Char
I want some Kebab in anyway
Maybe they make it real
Maybe together we can Yelp it here
Falafel is better
Starting with cocktails got so much to choose
Bo Bites I'll starting singing
Me, myself I got reviews to prove


It was a late night bite with a friend of mines and wasn't sure what to expect of this place.  To be honest, I didn't know it was a Mediterranean restaurant, but not to say I was disappointed.  I started with a drink and then shot forget the food menu right away.

My friend order their Falafel Bites while I went for their Chicken Kebab.  My friend wanted to share, but she ended up eating it all haha!  Needless to say, I was a good friend and offered her some of mines -- wink!  The Chicken Kebab was atop a bed of Basmati rice and came with a trio salad and Tzatziki.  The trio salad was light and sweet and had a perfect blend of salt and pepper.  The rice was light and paired well with the chicken which was slightly dry, but dipping it in the Tzatziki sauce helped add some moisture.  The chicken had a bit of a char to it; giving it a burnt taste, but it was to be expected since it was served on a skewer.  

Overall, I was pretty impressed with Char and their food.  The service was good and I always appreciate good seasoning and just the right amount in my books.  The ambiance is upscale, but in these parts they don't mind shorts and t-shirts. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Can I get an amen?! This place has great prices, a chic atmosphere and AMAZING food. Forget overpriced mediocre Scottsdale food here. Service was friendly at attentive as well. 

We got 2 drinks - both delicious. I got the obvious call which gave me a buzz (usually this takes me 2-3 drinks in an hour tbh so I'm for this). 

Appetizer was the falafel bites and spicy chicken skewers. The falafel bites were 6 over a bed of taziki sauce. Gotta say the falafels here were way more flavorful than the resident favorite in Chicago which is saying a lot. The chicken was just spicy enough. Came with 4 skewers over a bed of rice. 

For an entree we shared the chicken palma (see photo) at the suggestion of our server and were not disappointed. Char grilled chicken in a teriyaki type sauce with pineapple and onions/peppers. I could eat that every day for dinner and enjoy my life. 

Trying to spread this among the area because this is one hidden gem that needs to be unearthed!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is great and the service is wonderful. The food pics on this site don't do it justice. The food is very flavorful. They have a great food and drink menu. The staff is very accommodating, helpful, and nice. My family and I have eaten here together for lunch and dinner and everything was great! I know my son has been here many times and we will continue to go back. I prefer to support locally owned restaurants and businesses."}
{"text":"This place is solid... must have the tomato and basil starter and the pink goddess dressing is a delight. A little pricey for lunch but delicious and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Came here by accident, but sometimes that's a blessing. I flew in to Phoenix today. Was looking for lunch and asked the hotel clerk for local recommendations and he directed me to a Mexican restaurant that I could never find. Did a quick search on yelp and found this place.

It is located in a rather new-looking  strip mall. The restaurant bar has a progressive, clean look and it looks brand new.

In looking at the menu and from talking to the bartender, they have a menu that is more on the healthier side; i.e., not a fried food menu. I saw a lot of entries that were protein-focused, with vegetables and/or rice/grains on the side.

I got the chicken kebobs. They were delicious. On a bed of rice with a cucumber, tomato and onion salad and this sauce that was awesome. I tried a Fat Tire Citradelic UP A from New Belgium  Brewing that was refreshing. 

They have a nice patio and the help was very friendly. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We came for lunch and unfortunately, the place was practically empty. I decided on a the Mediterranean steak wrap and fries. I think the fries needed seasoning and the steak wrap was okay. I didn't think the taste and flavor was worth the price I paid for it, which was around $18 with tax and tip. Not sure if I will be back, but happy to have tried it."}
{"text":"Char took over the spot where Bink's Scottsdale was located. I finally got around to trying char and it was just okay. Very average food and average experience. Warning for beer lovers...the beer options are not impressive, so I ordered a glass sauvignon blanc. For my entree, I ordered the steak kebab, which comes with a trio salad (cucumbers, tomatoes, onions) and basmati rice. The steak was cook nicely but was a little bland. It was much better with the tzatziki sauce. The basmati rice was really disappointing, dry and flavorless. Overall, I felt like I had to cover my food in tzatziki sauce to make it tasty."}
{"text":"I've come here several times and love it! This is seriously a hidden gem of a restaurant. Delicious food, great happy hour and super friendly staff! Definitely won't be disappointed!!!!"}
{"text":"Char is one of those undiscovered gems in Scottsdale. They have an incredible menu of gyros, kebabs, soups, salads and standard entrees. I've had the pleasure of trying 5 of 6 different items and all of them are delicious. The atmosphere is also fantastic with a modern barn feel. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood join for our family.  Casual, yummy food.  really friendly service to our kids which I really appreciate.  I would try it if you like checking out new spots.  Nice addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"So this is actually only my second, ever, Yelp review. I had a perfect bartender called \"Liz\" who was absolutely delightful...: However, I had ordered a Stella and after 1 sip I asked \"Liz\" what was being poured from the Stella tap previously... I asked because I tasted a bit more than Stella in my glass. Turns out that a \"peanut butter porter\" was being dispensed from that tap previously. I had suggested that maybe the lines could be a bit cleaner So not taste anything other than the beer I wanted... The reason for the 2 star review..., she had said something to, who I thought was, the manager(turns out he is one of the 2 owners \"Paul\") about what I said, tasted, and had confirmed by \"Liz\". \"Paul\" immediately dismissed and essentially called me s liar in front of the whole bar... I suggest that, as an owner, you guys rethink how, what you say, effects if somebody wants to stay at your bar or what they tell people about the service provided. Thanks Liz for being so delightful though..."}
{"text":"Currently yelp says this place closes at 6pm but yelp is incorrect they stay open much later (we were there until at least 8pm).  Anyway service was very kind and our food was great.  I encourage getting the lollis as your appetizer."}
{"text":"A nicely run bar and restaurant. I highly recommend this restaurant if you are looking for quality food and an affordable price. The steak wrap had at least 5 ounces of very tender steak. Their gyro is amazing. Get out of the busy old town area and enjoy a top notch restaurant."}
{"text":"I am from the East coast where Mediterranean food is very present, and this is the closest I can get to that experience, I could even argue that it is better. Service is fabulous and food is even better."}
{"text":"I made a reservation and when We arrived there was no room for seven.we ended up sitting outside which was fine . There was one server for the entire restaurant. 
The chicken and steak were over cooked,and the food was cold. All in all the none of us will go back to Char"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Over the course of the week we were in Scottsdale, my husband and I ate here three times. Meat was seasoned and cooked perfectly, the tzatziki was divine, and the service was excellent. Try the chicken gyro, beef medallions, really anything. You won't be disappointed. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Lamb gyro...the best I have ever had, the sauce...to die for, ask for extra!  Salad...looks like it didn't have dressing...but leaves delicately flavored to perfection.  Coffee....I usually don't like black coffee...i loved theirs.  Pita bread and Hummus...not dry but warm for a long time.  Hummus was best ever."}
{"text":"I had dinner here with a friend on Thursday.  I really enjoyed the atmosphere.  The décor is very stylish with a hint of tradition.  The background music gave a lounge like atmosphere.  It wasn't very busy, but I think this would be a great place to come with friends or date night.  The food was my overall favorite, a little pricey but no more expensive then the other restaurants in the area.  Overall experience great, will definitely go again."}
{"text":"We had an amazing experience at Char! Kelly was a fantastic server- very knowledgeable about both the food and drinks/wine. We started with the calamari, a couple of cocktails (the Gyspy Tears and My Lil Friend- both delicious). Calamari was perfect- tasted the calamari and not just fried food! My boyfriend had the rosemary chicken and I had the lamb chops- BOTH WERE PHENOMENAL! I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone look for great atmosphere, yummy drinks and great food!"}
{"text":"The food was decent. But the service was terrible. Went with 12 people, they took way too long for us to get drinks. We ordered over $600 worth of food and drinks. They then messed up our checks. We've now been waiting 45 to leave. And there are only two other tables with people at them in the restaurant. This is unacceptable."}
{"text":"Did I come on an off day?!

Walk in on a Wednesday between Christmast and New Years, and the restaurant is empty with only 1 other table seated. We order the lamb burger and steak kabobs.  The lamb burger was dry, and the steak kabobs weren't as tender as I would have liked.  Service was good, but the food didn't impress.  I was really surprised given this place has 4.5 Yelp stars, so either it's getting some fake reviews/review inflation or the kitchen was having a really off night.  However, the almost empty restaurant can't be a good sign..."}
{"text":"Read the reviews so I had to check this place out. Newer restaurant with a patio in my neighborhood. We came on a weekday so it wasn't very busy when we arrived. Service was average, could have been a little better considering the lack of crowd. The great food and nice wine selection made up for that. I had a wonderful chicken strawberry salad and my mother and husband had a Cajun shrimp dish with a chocolate dessert to share. When we were leaving I noticed the place had gotten much busier I was happy to see. Everyone should get a taste of this great food and wine"}
{"text":"Really like this place! Everything is fresh and I love that they know how to make an amazing salad. Will totally go back!"}
{"text":"Food was good.  Atmosphere was cool.  Wait staff was very pleasant.  Could have done more with table settings and lighting on tables to make each dining experience more inviting.  
Prices are way too high!  21$ for a skewer.  
$138 bill for chicken app, 2 salads, 2 skewers and two cocktails.  If it was half the price we would go back for sure.  But the prices are way too high for that establishment in my opinion.  We could have eaten at Houston's for the same price."}
{"text":"We had a lovely late lunch/early dinner here today. I hadn't been in the place since Binks closed, which didn't surprise me since they were never my cup of tea. So glad to see a great restaurant like Char move in! CHAR has looked good from day one, and did not disappoint! The surroundings are elegant but comfortable. I love the natural lighting in the dining room. The service was attentive, knowledgable, and helpful. The food was fresh and delicious and filling. My friend and I shared the hummus and pita and then we both ordered the lamb gyros. Everything was wonderful! Even the iced green tea was tasty. The owner, Pete, was welcoming and friendly and checked with us to make sure everything was to our liking. It certainly was. We will be back soon and bring more friends!"}
{"text":"This new restaurant has some of the best selection of salads and appetizers and fresh food, refreshing to find this spot. It also has a bar for nibbling in food and a drink while whatching some sports."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious! 
Fantastic salads (santorini was so delicious with the pink dressing and Sonoma was amazing), great service, amazing meat skewers (shrimp was amazing)!!! Can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and very fresh! Thoroughly enjoyed the lamb burger and the rice pudding is ahmazing!"}
{"text":"We went here on a limb, for lunch, after reading positive reviews and we were not disappointed!! We were greeted promptly and able to choose our booth. The service was wonderful and very prompt. We shared the sriacha chicken skewers and they were lite but flavorful. The lamb gyro was delicious. Loved the tzatziki sauce! I'd highly recommend Char!!"}
{"text":"Family friendly.  Awesome food.  Friendly staff.  Good service.  Enjoyed the meal.  Too bad we are from Seattle and can't come back anytime soon."}
{"text":"We came here to try the food out and ofcourse thats what you do when they have happy hour. 
The food was okay not a big difference with other hamburger restaurants. When they came with the bill we had to pay the full amount because we were not sitting at the bar. Thats crazy because i was there with 3 teenagers, i dont like them at the bar! I feel taken advantage of.  
To me this is not really happy hour!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. I intended to have lunch at Houston's but the wait was long and it was quite loud. Luckily I discovered Char Kitchen - same parking lot. The food was fresh, service was good - I definitely recommend Char Kitchen."}
{"text":"Met a friend for happy hour on a Friday night.  They said they only honored happy hour prices at the bar, but there were only 3 tall tables at the bar and all were taken.  I had the Siracha Chicken Skewers, they were good with the perfect amount of spice, but very small sized portion."}
{"text":"Great food! Since it is Mediterranean inspired,   there are definitely healthy but tasty options! For appetizers we had the calamari and the  chicken lollies, both were good, I was partial to the lollies. As entrees I had the steak wrap, with veggies as my side and my fiancé had the gyro and fries, both did not disappoint. 
On a random note, while I did not have a salad for my first visit, I feel that you can really  judge a place by what it does with the salad menu. Their salad menu options had a diverse mixture of vegetables, garnishes and dressings that I thought was impressive.
I will definitely be recommending this place to friends, and also keeping it front of mind with my fiancé when we want to go out to dinner and want to have healthy options!!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Sorry... I was in the middle of eating my Mediterranean Steak Wrap while writing this. I should probably put my wrap down first... :)

Anyway what a great place. This has just been s to go place for several time and finally decided to check out the bar. Very modern and beautiful inside, slot of wood... The bar is very comfortable and our bartender was prompt and very courteous. We had the Crispy Calamari and Chicken Lollis and both were really good. Everyone there is very friendly and fun. 

Everything we have had is very fresh and done right. So far my favs are the Savory Pita (Awesome) Mediterranean Steak Wrap (Awesome) and Chicken Lollis (Double Awesome) Really can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"First experience was last night with two of my good friends...was very friendly, love our server Kelly, very helpful good suggestions, she obviously likes working there. I was very pleased as were the two others  will return.  And my chicken wrap was to die for."}
{"text":"Food is good and healthy, service is good. We enjoyed eating there and no long waits. Definitely would go there again"}
{"text":"Great place!  Good food and the staff was well trained and awesome!  Pete (the owner) gave us some history and Liz made sure every thing was timely and hot.  The mezze plater featured tasty hummus.  And entrees from the chicken skewer for our 7/7/8 year old grandson to the lamb chops for our 70 year old grandfather were served perfectly."}
{"text":"For me this is a neighborhood restaurant that fills a space in Hilton Village, one of the most pleasant and well managed shopping centers around. Clearly and accurately catering to the local demographic, Char has managed to fill a niche creating a quality restaurant without going overboard on trendy and price. The interior is very nicely done creating a warm and welcoming environment.
Showing up moderately hungry, late in the dinner service, we started with a specialty chicken lemon rice soup which is one- of -a -kind delicious. My wife ordered a lamb gyro which was extremely tasty and well put together and generous to the point that she could not finish it, so it came home for tomorrow's lunch. My dish was a platter of three sliders all garnished differently, that were cooked perfectly and outstanding. We had intended to order more. possibly one of the chef's dinner specials, but we were full. Our plan is to return, catch the full scope of the chef's talents and stay for one of the vaunted desserts."}
{"text":"Our server, Justin was the bomb! Knowledge of the wines was very impressive. Good, apps, decent prices, calamari, perfect!!!
Very comfortable, nice atmosphere!!"}
{"text":"Meat was raw and food was just not good. Chicken lollis tasted like they were dressed in Ketchup. My least favorite Mediterranean food I have ever had."}
{"text":"Really authentic Mediterranean grill... Food is spicy and flavors are on point.... I would recommend this place for some who is done of middle eastern food"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this restaurant for the first time, last night.
We look for mediterranean food wherever we travel.
We shared a large spinach salad. Very filling and delicious. 
Strawberries, thinly sliced apples and roasted pecans.
Perfectly seasoned with a light vinaigrette dressing.
I ordered a lamb burger and a side of roasted vegetables.
Everything was perfectly cooked. 
My husband ordered a steak skewer. It came with rice pilaf.
It was also perfectly cooked.
We ended with rice pudding.
We will definitely be returning to this restaurant.
I'll ask for a patio table although the booth was very comfortable.
We had a nice chat with the owner. He is a history buff and loves
talking about the Balkans. So do we!"}
{"text":"Superb.  I wish we lived closer.  Exc service, except food, great prices too.   The grass fed hamburger was done perfectly, not burnt and very tasty.  Lots of choices, it was hard to decide.  Don't miss this place."}
