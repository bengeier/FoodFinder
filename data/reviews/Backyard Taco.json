{"text":"I like this place! I have had good experiences here although I've only been twice. If you were to compare any other places that have quick service (fast food) Backyard Taco has a much better quality of food. It's a little pricier than most fast food places but for the service and quality, it is worth it."}
{"text":"Visited on Thursday, arrived at 553pm. 10 min wait in line, understandable because of crowd. 31 mins to get food. Child sized portions for tacos and quesadilla. Steak burrito was like a grease explosion in your mouth when taking a bite. There is no way this food should cost what it does, taste as such and take so long. The processing line to prep was way too slow and the attendant handing out the orders looked confused everytime she recieved an order to call out. I was scanning the kitchen and restaurant to see if management and ownership might be walking around trying to fix things and help. Didn't see anyone that stood out. New restaurants like this need to have their act together before opening. As of now, my impression is cemented and my family won't return."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! It's got great Authentic Mexican food that never disappoints. However, their customer service is not that great. After the person in front me ordered their, I was waiting to be called up. The girl at the register made eye contact then looked back down. So, I just approached the register and while she was taking my order she was chatting with another co-worker and doing something on her phone. If it wasn't for the food I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Two stars because the tacos are really good, but when the line is out the door and the only 3 order takers are either on the phone taking orders or giving orders to those who had phoned in their orders, it doesn't give a good impression. Don't have your front facing cashiers taking phone orders when it's a long line!"}
{"text":"Yum. I love the crazy potato~ Order ahead and take out. Super busy all the time. Taco Tuesday is off the hook."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE the atmosphere. The back patio is so nice and spacious. They have little tables for kids and all the tables are easy to move if you have a big group. I wasn't overly impressed with any of the salsas at all. And it took about 20 minutes for 4 street tacos to come out. But the tacos were great! Today was our first time here so we tried one of each. Chicken, carne asada, and al pastor. I'd definitely recommend al pastor. It was delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"Backyard Taco was serving at the Johnson Elementary Carnival. The food was fantastic and grilled right before us. Really enjoyed the carne asada and pollo street tacos. Everyone was raving about their food. One parent was raving about her papa loca. NICE!"}
{"text":"The worst food I had in a while seriously 
The \" carne asada \" on the grill was chopped 
Into itty-bitty pieces that had a non meat
Funky taste  and more of the same with 
The chicken. This place did  have a long line 
At 4pm on a Monday but I suspect this will end in a couple of months after people see for themselves that it's place is not even ok.
Oh yea the men's bathroom was dirty also the main floor was dirty as well it looked like  place lacked a manager ."}
{"text":"Great authentic tacos, their Carne Asada tacos are out of this world and their homemade salsas make them that much better."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I just don't like it which is fine, everyone has different taste buds. But I do have to say each time I've been in I've had so much gristle in my taco or burrito (yuck) and the tables were disgusting and needed to be wiped down and there was trash everywhere.   5 tables open but we didn't want to sit at any. Finally picked the least gross one and wiped it down ourselves and threw away the trash.   The floor had bits of food everywhere, it was just generally untidy and unwelcoming."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times and it was alright. Enough to come back a couple more times. I am not sure that I will be coming back again. First off it was extremely busy which is a good sign that a place is good. I had called my order ahead and came to pick it up. It was ready pretty quickly - we got a bean and cheese tostada, a bean and cheese gordita, 2 carne asada tacos, a chicken quesadilla, a bag of chips and salsa and a carne asada burrito. When I opened up the bag and took of the foil the food did not look very good. Some of the food was kind of unrecognizable that I actually went it and had them double check my order. The two tacos kind of seemed that they were thrown together and one was on top of the other but my son said that he liked them. The burrito was a good size burrito and my daughter said it was ok. My other two kids split a chicken quesadilla and they both ate the whole thing. The tostada and the gordita were small - about the size of a corn tortilla and really smashed. When I pulled off the foil most of the cheese and some of the beans came off. The gordita tasted fried, which I had asked for it grilled, maybe frying is part of it being a gordita but there was not much difference in what it looked like. Also after taking my first bite into the gordita I found a hair. Nothing to turn you off from food faster is finding a hair in your food. I ripped off the part that had the hair in it and threw it away before my kids saw it because as a mom I know that if they had seen the hair they would have refused to eat their food and honestly I did not want to waste $27 in food. The tostada was pretty good which I shared with my baby. Even though there is many good reviews for this place I most likely won't be coming back after my experience."}
{"text":"Great ambiance.  Birria is the highlight of this place.  So good.  Taco Tuesdays are happening here, so the wait is a bit longer.  Love it here."}
{"text":"This place was highly recommended by several friends. While it was good I dont think that it lived up to the hype. I ordered steak and chicken tacos. The steak had good flavor and they did pack as much meat as they could into the tiny tortillas. I need more time to sample and explore the salsa bar but the creamy green jalepeno salsa was good. The chicken tacos lacked flavor and were a little dry. Prices were a bit higher than I expected. I paid $8 flat for 3 small tacos and a coke in a bottle. The place was tiny and it was difficult to get to the salsa and back to my table. I was there during lunch on a Friday so that is to be expected. Service was average. The tables were clean and the place appeared well kept. Great story of how the place was started, good food but just did not live up the hype."}
{"text":"The food is great when they get it right. I actually alter my route home to get their yummy tacos, crazy potatoe, etc... I work a long day, so I use the drive thru. They have an exceptional drive thru employee. Don't know her name but she is a hispanic young lady who not only knows me from my order before I even pull up to the window, but even knows the type of hot sauce when she sees my face. Probably because I drive thru at least 4 times a week. 

The other lady I have dealt with is useless. She took my order and I asked her to repeat it back to me since she has screwed it up 3 times in the past. Today I ordered 3 Birria tacos with cheese only and one Birria queseililla with cheese only. Got home to find out the tacos were correct but the quesidilla was covered in cilantro with no cheese. Threw it in the garbage as cilantro disgusts me. They have lost my business. I love the food but I have gotten 3 screwed up orders, all thanks to her. My suggestion, eat in. I don't have the time to do that. BTW, I like the food so much the tacos were going to be my lunch tomorrow I like the food that much. Now it's my dinner. I've been raving about this place to my friends...No More!"}
{"text":"Um Yum!  So easy and yummy!  Always busy!  Just a great place to grab a quick bite.  Not an overly huge establishment, but perfect for a yummy taco on the run!"}
{"text":"get the potato. everything here is good but especially the potato. i love ruben so much if he wasn't married to maricela i'd propose tomorrow. they are both awesome and so nice--i have been eating their food since they were selling it in their backyard and everytime i see them they greet me like family."}
{"text":"I'm from la. I was at a wedding and in town for less than 24 hours. Wedding food sucked. I love Mexican food. I look on Yelp. I instantly find this place. It's rare you see a spot with 4.5 stars and almost 809 reviews. I uber from wedding to here. It literally blew my mind! I got one each of all 4 tacos al carbon and an horchata. 

The owner was working and she was such a sweetheart. I told her my story and she was so appreciative. Will come back here every time I'm in PHX. 

Cheers and God bless!"}
{"text":"Backyard Taco is my favorite mexican food place in Arizona. Great food, service, and eating area."}
{"text":"best food in the world. i go here all the time with my family and i've never been disappointed"}
{"text":"Hip place. Very nice inside with interesting colors and very clean. Terrific bathrooms. 
The tacos and chicken quesadilla were good; different than your local 'burto's taco shop in a good way. 
I'd say your paying a little bit for the \"experience\" but overall is worth it. Definitely will return.

Just don't expect the dilapidated taco shanty prices"}
{"text":"Great tacos! Simple menu with great quality!!  The guacamole had a delicious lime taste, I couldn't believe it!!! You need to eat here."}
{"text":"Been hearing about them for years...Love Backyard Taco, family owned with a fast friendly service delicious tacos, salsa bar. Its grilled meat, fresh veggie toppings. You will love it."}
{"text":"Great authentic tacos. The birria pork is divine. The restaurant is always crowded and it is easy to see why.  You should probably try it, though based on the number of reviews it has you probably already have."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Brought all my coworkers here the other day for the first time and they loved it too and couldn't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is hands down best street tacos ever! We are sooooooo excited for the news of a Gilbert location. They have come so far & we love supporting this amazing local eatery!"}
{"text":"Finally some decent Mexican food out east! Yes gringos, not all tacos are fried in a hard shell. 
The service indoors was great. Nice smiley people. Love the simple menu. Fair prices. Tacos and Burritos are tasty. Love the salsa bar with the cucumbers. The drive thru on the other hand, I was not greeted with a smile. I ordered my usual tacos with burrito meal, but was not offered any side of salsa or limes. I honestly felt like I was processed through the pick up window. I get better drive thru service at Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Extremely delicious!!!  We got here around 11am before the lines got long, and this is recommended. Around noon it began to get chaotic. It's easy to see why though because the food was absolutely perfect. The meats are cooked right in front of you on a large  charcoal grill. Yummmm"}
{"text":"We landed in AZ and my step daughter and her husband took us here. The tacos are great!! The burrito was fabulous as well. I had the steak tacos and my wife had chicken, both just as good. They had homemade salsa which was also good. The setting was quaint, and the line stretched out the door, though it moves quite quickly. If you want authentic tacos this is a great choice."}
{"text":"People of Gilbert! Get a clue! Worst Mexican food I have ever had. First off real Mexican meat is marinated well before it is cooked. This meat came right out of the package and onto the grill. Lots of rice & beans to make the burrito look huge. Service is terrible. Food is terrible. Soda mix was terrible. One star for the nice patio this time of year. Definitely won't be back!"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican street tacos. All the tacos are delicious. The salsa bar allows customers to add more onion, radish, like, salsa, or guacamole salsa. You can also ask for grilled jalapeño and onions. YUUUUMMMM. 

The crazy potatoe is also a favorite. I get it every time no matter what I order. It's that delicious. It's seriously changed my appreciation for a baked potato. I love the Mexican take on the baked potato."}
{"text":"very good and fresh tacos and chips. have always loved going here. authentic mexican food. quick service. nice casual place."}
{"text":"While I like the food at this place, it's very one-note. The ordering process is simple: they have a set of fillings - meat, pico, avocado, cheese - and you choose what form you'd like it in, taco, burrito, quesadilla, maybe a few others. They don't offer hard shell tacos, which is disappointing, if you prefer the style. They do have an alright selection of decent salsas.

If you prefer to take the food to go, be aware that the packaging tends to leak. I've never gotten all the way home, and not had a wet mess to deal with.

All in all, I have difficulty justifying going here, simply because of the lack of options. I also find it annoying that avocado is a default filling, rather than an add-on. Avocado is relatively expensive, and I don't want to be paying for something that I won't be eating."}
{"text":"Yum! I've heard so much about this place and it didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"This is a Amazing place for tacos. I highly recommend it. Family friendly. I love the tacos"}
{"text":"I do not understand what the big hype is about this place. You ask for a quesadilla and you get pieces of meat and I think cheese. It's disgusting. You can get much more quality backyard tacos off the streets in Los Angeles. 

To the gracious reply to my posting. My comment would only be although this establishment may have been voted as best tacos it would be ...as far goes as a true taco place there is not much competition to vote. It's arizona. And I still agree if you want true authentic tacos .. king tacos Los Angeles California is pretty authentic . Thanks for the response . And no thank you. We will not return under any circumstance."}
{"text":"I love tacos! And this meet my wildest dreams! Definitely has my stamp of approval!"}
{"text":"Not for vegetarians! I ate here recently with my carnivore sisters. They loved the carnitas burritos. I tried to eat vegetarian. Awful! The crazy potato is just smashed potato with lettuce and onion. The bean tostada was 2 tablespoonfuls of beans and cheese on tiny corn tortilla. I gave this 3 for carnivores, but 0 stars for vegetarians."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!!!!!!!! Very well priced!!!!!!! I will return often!!!!!!! I love the alcohol free environment!!!!!! Thank you for a great dinner!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place was so good! The atmosphere really adds a lot. Although they ran out of water cups and when we asked for one they gave us a giant bean cup that had grease and beans on the lip. Other than that it was great!"}
{"text":"Order was wrong, food left out and only discovered once home. Not good for take out as they can't afford proper to go containers and put your food in styrofoam trays with foil on top. Ordered a quesadilla and it didn't have cheese! Tiny tacos overpowered by onion flavor, which we asked to be held from everything on the order and it was on everything. Never going to again, Taco Bell is better and that says a lot!"}
{"text":"This place has grilled beef and chicken and might make a run against Carolinas for best food in my mind. The salsas were delicious.  We had tacos and burritos. Recommended."}
{"text":"My second favorite food is tacos. You can't go wrong with tacos. I just moved back to the mainland from HI and the lack of tacos on the island's is quite sad. Trying this place was exactly what I was missing. Thank You!"}
{"text":"I know that if I add to the positive reviews, more people will go and that means I'll have to wait longer; you all deserve to know how good it is! 
I've had the Carne Asada & Pollo Asado tacos, Carne Asada & plain bean and cheese burrito, and the Carne Asada quesadilla. Everything I  have eaten there has been pretty amazing! I love the flavor and authenticity - you can't get it without the carbón grills they have. The horchata is on point. The only slight downside that I will say is that the plain quesadilla does lack cheese and their inside seating is rather limited. Go for the food!!"}
{"text":"My wife gets an urge every couple of weeks to come here.  I like the papa loca, the pork(al-pastor) and carne asada tacos. Yummy. Service is good also."}
{"text":"I had the carne Asada burrito and the meat was so juicy and flavorful! Definitely will be back! The price is right, however the location is not ideal and they are always busy."}
{"text":"Best food in Mesa, we love their tacos & quesadillas. Worth the short wait - they're always busy because of how good the food is!"}
{"text":"BEST MEXICAN FOOD IN MESA! I love the carne asada quesadillas. I seriously feel like I'm on the beach in Mexico. And the horchata is to die for. It's REAL horchata which a lot of places don't offer. It's perfectly sweet and milky, I'm obsessed. Plus, the owners are so friendly and welcoming. The whole staff strives to keep the environment clean and enjoyable for you. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Do you like Mexican food? No, I'm not talking about The \"Americanized version\" of Mexican food, Il am talking about real, authentic, and not covered in 6 pounds of cheese Mexican food? Then Backyard Taco is your place.


The smell of the meat grilling filled the air the moment you step inside. Backyard Taco rivals any street taco place you've ever eaten at in Mexico. The tacos el pastor were the bomb, and indistinguishable from the ones we get in Rocky Point.

If you've not tried this family owned little joint, you need to. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today after hearing from friends how good the food it. Had carne asada taco, tostada, & quesadilla. They were ok, but their salsas were not good. If I come back, I will try the chicken."}
{"text":"This is how tacos are supposed to be made.  You can see them grilling the meat right behind the counter.  Great spot... would recommend this place over just about every other taco shop in the East Valley."}
{"text":"Yum! I so hope this place stays open for good! It's a simple menu and I love that they have Mexican sodas. Their tacos are so good, even the tortillas are grilled. Service is great, I'm pretty sure it was the owner the last couple times we've been there. Friendly man. I'm glad they got rid of those clueless little girls when they first opened. Place is clean and I love how they fixed it up.

Con: They're closed Sundays!"}
{"text":"Authentic Tacos 100% wonderful flavors!! Favorite is tacos de Birria so bomb! Fresh ingredients always, only down side gets too packed and hard to find seats but service is quick and friendly, also prices went way up use to be 1.69 for taco now it's like 2 something , I still go though I'm willing to pay extra!!"}
{"text":"This is an ok place to have taco's. I ordered 12 steak and 12 chicken Taco's. I read a lot of the reviews before going and with all the 5 stars I thought I would give it a try. Unfortunately for me the steak and chicken were over cooked and dry. I had the corn tortillas and they were wonderful.  Not much in the flavor department when it came to the meat. I will say that the jalapeno sauce was very good and spicy. But having only one very good sauce will not cause me to go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"The chicken and carne asada are aces (burritos, tacos, quesadillas). Doesn't matter what they're in, they're delicious. The birria was ok (shredded beef), nothing to write home about. The horchata was also very good. I instantly loved this place at first bite. The smell inside is amazing, and the food matches."}
{"text":"First time here, place has been opened for a week. Clearly working out the first week kinks. Great experience though!! Owner/manager came and worked the line and let customers know that the wait was longer than anticipated and apologized. All the staff was personable and were able to answer questions. The backline staff was working very hard and getting orders out quickly as possible. My family enjoyed the carne asada and chicken tacos, the carne asada quesadilla, carne asada burrito, and a bean & cheese burrito. The carne asada was soooo delicious, even more so after watching the way they cooked it. The chicken was not bad, but that carne. Mmmm. Bean and cheese was awesome as well. 
We will be back sooner than later. Great job!! Great food!!"}
{"text":"I came here because people spoke so highly of it in a class I was in. My experience is that the food is good. I've had way better out of food trucks but there was nothing wrong with the food what so ever. I took away a star because the team there has absolutely no personality. They are not mean or rude, they are just blah. I watched everyone as I ate and I saw three people smile once and that was only when they were talking to each other. The older guy with the gray hair which I would consider maybe the manager has a permanent frown. I won't go back but the food is good. 

Update:

I'm in Phoenix for another training class and everybody wanted to try backyard tacos again. I had to update to be fair so here goes. I leave it with 4 stars although the staff was much better, friendly, very observant. I still can't give 5 stars because although the food is good it's just not 5 stars. It's still a great place to eat and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Back Yard Taco is a beautiful place obviously created with much love.  There is a beautiful outdoor patio with misters.  I had a chicken taco and the crazy potato.  Both were equally delicious.  There is a salsa bar where you can load up with whatever pleases you.  The people are very friendly and helpful for someone who doesn't know one thing from another and the food was served quickly.  The owners should be proud of their back yard taco."}
{"text":"I love this place so much. We come here every other Tuesday to have dinner. It's always crowded and the staff is great. We have never had a issue with any of the items on their menu. We normally get the Family dinner which for 22 lb of meat it's worth it. You can have Carne Asada, Chicken or Carnitas. We normally stick with the Carne Asada. Tacos galore! If your looking for a place that you can sit at not recommended it's always crowded but good luck finding a spot.  We do take out and it's fast. It's also worth the wait..."}
{"text":"Surprising little hole in the wall joint has great tacos. Parking can be a challenge. Friendly staff. Good vibe."}
{"text":"Wish this place was bigger so we could eat there every day without having to sit in the hot sun! Great food!"}
{"text":"Great hidden secret back yard taco is fantastic.  Had Carne asada burrito.  It was one of the best burritos I have had. I also pick some Carne asada tacos to take home to family. Great price nice little restaurant."}
{"text":"The tacos are good but not enough to fill you up and certainly not worth the
Price, waited a long time and got some really small tacos!!
I would not go there again for sure!"}
{"text":"Street tacos where very good. The carne asada and Brillo where the best ones I tried. To me the best thing they had were their beans. Very good texture and a good helping of cheese on top. Servers were very helpful as I asked a bunch of questions and service was quick. I noticed they kept very busy as we say and ate. Always had a line but moved people through it very fast. Good stuff"}
{"text":"Since I've been in Arizona, this is the BEST place to get a taco fix. I like the salsa bar, too."}
{"text":"Not very impressed I would rather eat so Cali fish tacos. When I went her I ordered tacos and they were very small. I was looking for dinner not a snack."}
{"text":"Carne Asada, Pollo, and Birria Tacos!!! Yelping out 5 Stars for Mesa's Best!!!!  The Birria is perhaps one of THE tastiest I have ever eaten and earns the 5 Stars :)

As far as Taquerias go this place is hard to beat!  It is worth a drive across town, I have to try the Steak Burrito the next time around."}
{"text":"It's not intentional but we always seem to get Backyard on Taco Tuesdays. No complaint buy me though , I'm  fine with saving a little money!  We haven't eaten at the restaurant yet and my husband is the only one that ever picks the food up but he says its a nice atmosphere. Busy and a bit crowded  but clean and he feels comfortable getting food there. The carne asada tacos are so good and I love that since they are street tacos I don't even mind that they don't have cheese on them. I usually judge Mexican food places on their beans and I really like Backyard tacos beans. The carne asada burrito is huge and packed full of quality meat. I'm not sure the name of the salsa but its a roasted salsa from the salsa bar and that's my favorite. I also like the simplicity of the menu, just the right amount of items to choose from.  We recently moved even closer to the restaurant and I consider that a definite win."}
{"text":"I love this place with all my heart. The menu is simple and absolutely perfect. The food is all made right there in front of you. The staff is great!"}
{"text":"Besides having amazing tacos the ppl working here are friendly. Debit machine went down. I said I'd go get cash,they brought food out to my wife while I was gone and I made sure I went in to pay even tho they didn't sweat it. Carne asada tacos are the best. I had five like a true fatty. Great flavor.super cheap. I wanted to eat so badly I took pic half way thru. Go there and have a good time"}
{"text":"Really good street tacos, great price. Fast service. Simple menu (15 items.) Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, amazing carne asada tacos and great prices! Can't wait for their new location to open in Gilbert!"}
{"text":"At peak hours, expect a wait. It is worth it! Great place to get authentic and inexpensive street tacos ($1.49 on Taco Tuesdays). Staff is friendly and seating is slim due to the high volume of patrons. Standing while eating didn't bother us, after all, they are street tacos!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Its fast, friendly, good polite workers. And awesome food. Nice clean atmosphere, and a nice patio to sit at with misters."}
{"text":"Do not bother going here. The prices are ridiculous, for food with no flavor. I paid $9.00 for a burrito! The only good thing about this place is that it looks cute."}
{"text":"I always heard of Backyard Taco so we finally went. It was a great experience. The food was legit and the atmosphere reminded me of a good old fashioned taco stand you'd find on the beach somewhere. Great street style tacos and a friendly staff. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great tasting food, service was ok due to the very busy night!
They were so busy that they couldn't close the doors because people just kept coming.
We all split a bean burrito and one of each of the tacos. The Tacos were good, I wasn't fond of the bean burrito though. Not a ton of seating."}
{"text":"I went for lunch one day. Ordered two steak tacos. The meat was very tasty but a little fatty which I had to eat around. Salsa was great! The restaurant was very clean inside and out."}
{"text":"Brandon Stevens loves tacos and Brandon loves backyard tacos. The food is stellar with a clean environment. The staff was 2nd to none!"}
{"text":"This place rocks! All of the food is awesome from the chicken tacos to the Carne asada quesadilla. The Birria tacos are second to none and the salsa bar is awesome with fresh salsa, guacamole,  and pickled onions that I have dreams about. If you are in the area try this place out it will not let you down, be warned they can get busy fast and they are a small restaurant. But I promise they are worth the wait."}
{"text":"I took my family to the grand opening last Monday and Backyard Taco did not disappoint. 

The lines were understandably long--it is a brand-spanking-new location--but they moved quickly and we didn't wait long to receive our food. We had just enough time to get our drinks and everything we needed from the awesomely large salsa bar (load up on the pickled onions!) when they called our number.

The tacos are the best I've ever had, even better than my beloved Tacos El Gordo in Las Vegas and District Taco in D.C. I absolutely love the carne asada, and my kids prefer the chicken tacos. I also recommend the loaded potato and the quesadillas, too. Be sure to get an order of chips and a side of refried beans for dipping. I promise you will not regret it.

I saw some of the comments taking issue with the service, but that was not our experience. It was very, very busy, but I never felt like we received anything less than great service. The employees were attentive and even the owners were walking around greeting people a smile and helping everyone get their food. They even bussed our table! That'll get a five-star service review from me."}
{"text":"2 years ago, me and my sweetie came into Phoenix from Denver for spring break. She elected to take me to the Mormon Easter celebration thing, and we decided to get something to snack on before going into the show. Not knowing any better we just stumbled along University Boulevard and saw a place that was \"Taco something\". It looked a little funky, but being hungry thought we'd give it a try. We got in there and we ordered the little barbacoa tacos. We got them with all the sauces (radishes and cucumbers) from the sauce bar. They were very tasty! When we return to Denver I figured I would find some good mexican food in the area. In the last 2 years , I have gone to Austin, Denver, Dallas, Houston, Palm Springs, San Francisco, San Luis Obispo, and Kansas City, looking for some good mexican food. I have gone out once a week in the Denver area seeking good food all to no avail. Once again this year she drags me down to Phoenix for spring break, and all I can think about is that little funky place with the great tasting tacos. I didn't know the name of it. I couldn't remember it. I have figured it was probably gone. so anyway we took off tonight and started driving down University Boulevard and lo and behold there it was! Backyard Taco! I was really excited, but prepared myself for disappointment, thinking that I had probably built it up way too much! we went in and the place was jammed packed! we ordered a chicken and barbacoa taco cuz I wasn't really so much hungry as I was looking for taste. I was surprised at the small price. The order came out and look exactly like I remember it. It couldn't be as good tasting as I had in my mind could it? Once again I looked it up from the sauce bar on everything and ordered myself a Mexican Coke made with real sugar. we sat down , the taste was amazing!! The beef has a great smoky flavor at all the sauces complimented the chicken and beef!  I plan on going back tomorrow and try one of the big burritos! I noticed that they also had won the 2015 best Mexican restaurant award for the local weekly hipster paper (sorry but I don't know what the name of the paper is but you know the name of the paper )... This place rules!"}
{"text":"Christina J.

Backyard Taco got delicious food at a good price , Me and my husband loves the beef@chicken tacos. And it's truly authentic . We'll be going back !"}
{"text":"Super fast service when there is no ordering line. I love their salsa bar with cucumbers, onion, and limes.  Clean place and great tasting carne asada burritos."}
{"text":"I love this place!!  Best tacos around, great friendly service!!  I am so glad they are in Gilbert now, drove to the Mesa one all the time, now it's just so close!!  Viva BYT!!"}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious! I stumbled across this place last week. I have been back a few times already. The carne asada tacos are pretty great, the chicken tacos are really tasty and the birria tacos are arguably the best tacos I have ever eaten. They taste so good to me that I started to fear that I had developed some kind of eating disorder. The kind where you love food more than yourself and keep eating way past the point of being full until you feel sick. The last time I was there I ate 7 tacos, a small refried beans, chips and salsa, plus pickled onions, radishes, and a plate full of cucumber slices. 

I do not recommend taking someone here on a first date. While you will definitely enjoy the food to the max, the depraved eating style you slip into my be a turnoff to the other person. Putting more taco in your mouth seems like a much better use of time than making idle small chat with someone you hardly know.

There is no doubt that you should eat here. Go as soon as possible. You will love it!

EDIT : July 2015 : Update

I eat here around once a week, but sometimes maybe three times in one week. I have a few tips to share with you. There are a couple of off menu items that you can order. My favorite is a burrito in a cup. I usually only order one when they have whole beans available. They have whole beans before they mash them into refried beans. It is great if I want to eat while driving or just to take home and eat it for dinner. When picking up your order you can ask them for grilled jalapenos and grilled onions. Be warned. I love hot food, but the jalapenos they serve are pretty freaking warm. My lower eyelids just started sweating just typing that. Man I love this place.

Oh man! Just updating this review made me crave Backyard Taco and I decided to run down there and grab a late lunch. I had 5 birria tacos and got a chicken burrito in a cup to go."}
{"text":"Went here on a review from a friend and it was fantastic! My husband and I ordered the chicken and steak tacos, plus a carne asada quesadilla--everything was outstanding. We will defintley be back!"}
{"text":"We love this place!

When we first moved from California, we began searching for a good take-out Mexican food place. Surprisingly, we were having a hard time finding one until we found Backyard Taco.

We eat here pretty regularly now. We find the tacos to be good, but we like the burritos even more! The restaurant is always clean. Also, they have a good selection of salsa's to choose from. 

If I knock them for anything, it is the guacamole. It is runny and seems like it came out of a squirt bottle - I'd rather have the real stuff. 

That aside, I highly recommend Backyard Taco!"}
{"text":"Best tacos in Mesa, possibly the state of Arizona!

What more can I say? Absolutely love everything this place has on the menu. My girlfriend and I are huge fans of getting the family meal (half chicken/half steak) to take home so that we can make our own tacos as we watch a movie. A couple of quesadillas and some beans round out the perfect movie dinner.

The place is usually packed, no matter the time of day. So either call ahead to order or be prepared to hangout for a bit."}
{"text":"I love this place. They have raised their prices since their backyard days (understandably), but the food is so delicious. The owners are very friendly. They are closed on Sundays, which is something I admire. Backyard taco is my favorite mexican place around!"}
{"text":"The only reason I didn't give them 6 stars is because they are far away from where I live. Everything is awesome. Beans, chips and salsa, chicken anything here are all great. Oh yea, the horchata is good too."}
{"text":"The definition of less is more. They have chicken, beef, pork and they spread it across burritos, tacos, and potatoes. Yeah you read that correctly potatoes,baked potato stuffed with the best Mexican flavors. Busy but efficient service makes it a breeze to order from here."}
{"text":"Way too much hype!  Finally made it there and ordered one of each of their tacos.  My favorite was the shredded beef, but the Steak didn't taste great and my chicken was really dry.  Ordered chips and salsa and some watery substance inside the cup was supposed to be salsa I guess.  The condiment bar was just OK as well.  They had a guacamole thinner than mayo that looked like the stuff you get at Taco Bell.  Well at least it was Taco Tuesday, so my disappointment came at a discount.  If you go, load up on Pico and drowned your taco so it at least seems moist and has a better flavor."}
{"text":"This has got to be the worst Mexican taco joint that I've every been too. The tacos and burritos were bitter tasting.  High oriced crappy tasting food."}
{"text":"Great place. I had an issue they had not faced before and instead of just saying no, we discussed it and they took care of it...I will get my tires from these guys because of that!"}
{"text":"I was extremely excited to try this place as I had visited and tried the food when it was really in the guy's backyard as the food was fabulous.

Wow, was this a total let down. I got a taco and gordita to go.
I got home and opened the items up. I was like, \"Is this the wrong thing or maybe a kid sized version?\". I couldn't believe how small it was. And for $2.25?? Really? WAY overpriced. These should be about 75 cents tops. And it was dry and bland.

Then the gordita was a little better, but that's not saying much. Still, so small. And for $4.25?? 

So, I spent $7 and felt like I didn't eat anything and what I did eat was tasteless. I usually don't like to leave bad reviews, but I wish I had gone to Taco Bell instead. Their items at least have some flavor.

Sorry, BY Taco, but I will not be returning. I'm sure you will do fine without my business but I will go elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"Love the street tacos here! Hot, fresh, fast and yummy!  If you're looking for sit-down dining, this is not the place.  It's called backyard taco for a reason...about 5-6 small tables inside and the line can wrap around a couple of them.  Screened in porch with tables is nice on a not too hot day, but my favorite thing is to get it to go and take it to a park or back to the office."}
{"text":"You know all these reviews saying it is amazing, better than you'd ever think ... ?  They're right!

Note, it can get crowded, so worth calling your order in advance!"}
{"text":"Finally ate at a place that reminds me of home! Great tacos. I love all the toppings and salsas. The carne is grilled to perfection and marinated with LOVE! Go by and bye some today!"}
{"text":"Awesome street taco style food.  Can't go wrong here. Only complaint is very limited seating."}
{"text":"A lack told me about his place. I got one of each taco flavor. Loved each of them equally. Service was fast and the prices were super affordable."}
{"text":"It was ok. Chicken and steak tasted like rubber. Currently in the bathroom shitting my guts out as I write this. toppings edge great though"}
{"text":"Heard about this place for a couple years and finally got around to trying it--man, wish I'd tried it earlier because it's delicious and very affordable. Been back several times already. Recommend the tacos (carne, pollo and birria), Crazy Potato and salsa bar. BYT is a small place that gets crowded at peak lunch/dinner times, but the wait is never that long. Inside seating is very limited so be prepared to sit on outdoor patio if during peak times."}
{"text":"I have to say, the Tacos here are bomb! Grilling meat on mesquite is not the same as doing it on a griddle like most places do and they still call it \"Carne Asada\". The salsa bar it's perfect and the birria salsa it's nice and spicy just like I like it. I guarantee you this place it's much much better  then every other place in town that calls them selves \"Mexican food\", this place very well competes with a Taqueria in Mexico. Hands down best place for tacos in the valley."}
{"text":"They are so nice here! I am vegetarian, and they helped me find something to eat.. The crazy potato was fantastic! Highly recommend it :-). Chips and salsas were really good too! FYI the beans have lard in them.."}
{"text":"The nicest thing I can say is that I was hungry and now I am not albeit at a premium $$$

The food is bland and not authentic at all.  This is another example of the chipotle-style implementation of Mexican food.  If you are looking for authentic street tacos, stay away.  If you want a standardized, watered down flavor profile appealing to a wide range of palettes, then give Backyard tacos a try."}
{"text":"We love this place!!! Best tacos ever for a fabulous price!! You should try even their beans they are great too. Even if there is a line they move fast!"}
{"text":"I found this gem searching through yelp. My wife is pregnant and is constantly craving authentic Mexican food. After searching through yelp, I found this place and ordered 3 tacos for her. She stated that it reminded her of her nanas cooking. If you're in the mood for tacos, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"The Papa Loco is the go to item.  The rest of them menu typical street taco fare."}
{"text":"We use to love the one in Mesa, but the quality of food went downhill. Decided to give it another shot at this location but again very disappointed. The service is horrible, and food is just okay. We recently went through the drive through and it was a mess! When we finally got to the window the workers handed me \"our food\" checked it in the car and it wasn't our food. Told the worker that I think you gave us the wrong order. They started to argue with me saying that was mine, when it clearly wasn't. Never apologized for the confusion. Came home to only notice our order wasn't correct again. Decided to drive all the way back to get what we ordered, the staff didn't apologize and it seemed like an inconvenience to make us what we ordered."}
{"text":"Best tacos in the valley hands down! The carne asada tacos here are fantastically tasty and the service is very friendly and cheerful! Such a great place for afternoon lunch or evening out with the family! PS. Gotta try the crazy potato!"}
{"text":"Well worth it. Great food at reasonable prices. A big plus, taco place that is very clean even the bathrooms."}
{"text":"I showed up and the parking lot was full and the line was packed.  Don't let that discourage you.  We had our food within 10 minutes still.  This place is great!  Casual, clean and authentic.  I loved the Pollo Quesadilla.  Don't forget salsa or guacamole in the salad area. I love Backyard Tacos!"}
{"text":"Not impressed .. Tastes like dry flavorless Mexican street tacos .. Only ok taco was steak 
Chicken was dry and shredded beef was runny
What's gross is they serve guacamole salsa which is a cheap way of serving watered down guacamole .. Was gross!!! Not worth the wait .. If I do come back won't be for the tacos for sure !!! What a disappointment .. I think dos gringos has better street tacos !!!"}
{"text":"I love tacos. I love Backyard Tacos. The place is great, it has an awesome layout, you can see them cook everything, and the tacos are unbeatable. The price is great too, you can walk out with a full tummy and a full wallet."}
{"text":"Best Tacos. I wont eat tacos anymore else! It is the best staff and the best food! I am there every Tuesday! I recommend the carne asada tacos with potatoes !!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing menu and super tacos!  One of our family favorites. We have been multiple times and great experience every time."}
{"text":"While I thought that the food was okay, the line was very slow with 4 groups waiting to have their order taken and only one person ringing in orders, it took much longer than I thought it should have.  There was an abundance of staff behind the counter in the kitchen area, 3 ladies just stood in the back corner just chatting away while the line got longer and longer. At one point one lady came and stood at a second register, however she didn't take any order nor did she acknowledge the long line.  When I sat down to eat at the only available table, that appeared to have food all around it, one of the ladies came and literally swept under me while I was eating.  It was extremely rude, no excuse me, nothing, like I was completely invisible, as she swept over my shoes and moved all the chairs at the table. I had the shredded beef, al pastor, and  carne asada tacos.  I would recommend them in that order.  The shredded beef had the most flavor, al pastor was a little fatty/dry but was alright, and the carne asada was pretty bland overall. Their salsa bar was good and well stocked.  Overall, I don't think I would go back due to the slow line and the rude lady who decided to assault my shoes with the broom."}
{"text":"It's OK, but not special.  Plenty of other nice priced mexican eating places around - So Cal Fish Taco Company, Nandos, Geckos.  No seating to dine in."}
{"text":"I came in on a Tuesday for lunch and this place was busy! I was able to place an order with-in 5 minutes of my arrival, the staff was friendly and helpful. I received my food ten 10 minutes later (not bad for how busy it was) I ordered carne asada quesadilla and birria tacos, the tacos were flavorful, tender and hot. The quesadilla was delicious! The steak had a chargrilled flavor that makes this taco shop stand out from many others. I will be back to bring others :)"}
{"text":"Had this recommended to us and it's good but not that great. I would go back in a pinch but won't go out of my way for it. Carne asada  tacos were tasty but salsa wasn't that good, no taste to it"}
{"text":"Love Backyard Taco! The menu is simple, the food is delicious (the crazy potato is on point!) and the guacamole is excellent (totally addictive). I also appreciate that they include fresh cucumbers, radish and pickled onions as part of the salsa bar. I would recommend that you go between 11-11:30am or after 1:30pm to avoid the lunch rush if you have the luxury to do so."}
{"text":"By far my favorite taco shop in az!!! Love their steak quesadillas the most but you could honestly close your eyes and pick something and you'll love it"}
{"text":"Being used to really good street tacos I used to eat in Guadalajara, I've found it nearly impossible to replicate the flavor of these delicious tacos this side of the border. That said it is not impossible. Backyard has these tacos that please every time when I'm craving the tacos from back home.

They have 3 kinds: pollo, birria y carne asada. Speaking to the owner, really cool guy, I found out they are Mazatlan style. I have never been to Mazatlan but the birria tacos taste just like birria tacos that I had back in Guadalajara. The food is very good and they are right around my neighborhood!

I usually get birria and asada so I have yet to attest to the pollo tacos. I get the yelp deal for the free chips. And always get grilled onions because they are awesome.

The charm of this place is that everything is made fresh. So if you like yourself a good taco,  try these out. I bet you will love it."}
{"text":"I've considered making a Yelp account for some time now so make note: Backyard Taco was the winning meal that sealed the deal.  
1. The best carne asada I've had in AZ
2. Tortillas are soft and fresh.  It tasted like they might have been lightly buttered which is as delicious as it sounds.
3. Fresh salsa bar with sides of cucumbers , radishes, and onions (try the onions).  
4. Friendly service 
5. Clean 

I ordered to-go and I wish I had ordered more.  Definitely returning soon!"}
{"text":"Not as good as the original location. Have found grisle and bits of bone in the chicken on more than one occasion, so usually only get carne asada if I go. Salsa bar is not well maintained.   Seems that the quality control has slipped a lot since they opened."}
{"text":"Try the carne asada quesadilla too! Hearty portions! Delicious! Muy Rico todo, very authentic, reminds me of Mazatlan, Mexico tacos!"}
{"text":"Ordered the chips and salsa, steak tacos, potato taco, and quesadilla.  The steak tacos were tasty; plenty of meat. The potato taco was a little dry, but I doused it with the salsa bar guacamole to kick it up a notch. The quesadilla was, meh. The chips and salsa was good. I will be back."}
{"text":"Love this place! I feel like I'm sitting in rocky point eating a real Mexican taco every single time."}
{"text":"It's so disappointing I wish I could've given this place at least 4 stars. This place was amazing way before they opened up the Gilbert location. Tacos are pretty bad now I don't know if they changed their meat or tortillas but it does not taste how it use to before and the service really sucks now compared to when the owners were there they had amazing customer service now they have some weird girls taking orders can't even say Hi back when you say hi when you first walk up to put your order in."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm! Fresh made carne asada and flan. My son and I love the carne quesadilla and pico de Gallo. Fast service, clean restaurant, delicious food! Reasonably priced for the excellent quality"}
{"text":"Hands down best tacos iv had in Arizona this place is holdin it down for sure. Friendly staff and easy to find. Iv been tellin everyone i know this place is a must"}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST carne asada burrito I've ever sank my teeth into.  I found this place on my 23 mile, 119 degree cycling journey home today.  The food here literally changed my life.  The staff was super friendly, service was amazing and the food I literally cannot say enough about; taste, flavor, portion, price, prep time all of it was outstanding.  Needless to say this may be a weekly stop in for me during my cycling journeys around Arizona.

Thanks for the support and see you all on the road!!"}
{"text":"I loved that they cook the meat on a wood burning Santa Maria grill. Makes all the difference."}
{"text":"I visited this taco shop and its a hit!!!
I pulled in and saw 3 police cars(they were eating inside) and I knew this must be a good spot. I give it 10 stars!
I recommend the to go menu to serve your family at home."}
{"text":"Great tacos, lots of flavor, the carne asada tastes amazing and their green sauce is great. The atmosphere is pretty cool. I would go there if you want some great tacos for a decent price."}
{"text":"The chicken tacos were very good. I ate three of them. I think the chips and salsa might have been my favorite part of the meal. I prefer the pico they have at the self serve bar. The guacamole (in my opinion) was disgusting, though. I think I want to try the quesadilla on my next visit."}
{"text":"This is our first time at backyard tacos on Higley and it won't be the last. The al pastor is as good, if not better, than what we eat in Mexico. The restaurant was clean, fast and accommodating. They have a huge outdoor patio with misting system. I can't wait to get hungry again."}
{"text":"Went here for a family member's birthday dinner. It was not enjoyable. I'm going to make this review short and sweet.

Meat- we had both chicken and steak. Chicken is flash cooked which makes it dry and flavorless. Steak was full of fat and tasted VERY similar to cheek meat. 

Tortillas- were great. We had both flour and corn.

Salsa- tasted sweet and like it was missing something. Also had that weird tomato sauce for tacos, it was awful and did not enhance the taco flavors.

Potatoes- which are $6.00, were dry and lacked flavor. Even my potato loving husband and grandfather didn't like them and that was a SHOCK! 

We didn't think this place lived up to the hype. We won't be returning. We prefer Gallo Blanco in PHX for some amazing street tacos!"}
{"text":"Backyard Taco is simply the best taco in town. The crazy potato -- crazy good. Great service, great atmosphere. I go often."}
{"text":"Good: 
1) Clean
2) Friendly Staff
3) Decent neighborhood
4) Nice Salsa bar selection that includes Avocado Crema- they call it guacamole
5) Nice atmosphere
6) Decent seating
7) Good Parking
8) Awesome drink selection
9) Gorditas

Bad:
1) Meat not trimmed- Fat on carne asada taco
2) Meat not marinated
3) Chicken is dark meat--or at least it seemed kind of greasy and gristly.  I suspect lots of drumsticks.  


Notice how most of the food is in the bad section.  If they would just trim the meat, it would be my favorite taco shop.  But I HATE fatty tacos that you have to pick through before you eat.  Good place for a mexican coke or jamaica and a cheese gordita I guess.."}
{"text":"Best tacos in town a bit pricey but well worth it. The place is small bit it is very clean. The food is fresh and the salsas are great. The pricing structure is a bit on the high end but it's well worth the money."}
{"text":"Even though I live right around the corner I had not eaten here yet, though I had wanted to try it for some time. So, I finally got the chance to. We got the mega family pack, carne asada,and I'm not lying when I say it was the best s*** I've had it in a long time."}
{"text":"This place is addictive! I've eaten tacos at several places in Mesa, Chandler, and Phoenix, but Backyard Taco has become my all time favorite! The food here reminds me of authentic street tacos you get in Mexico. They are absolutely amazing! They offer a family platter that feeds my family of 5 with some to spare. Prices are good and food quality is great!"}
{"text":"Great Tacos, Great Service, Great place. It is a fun place to eat, very relaxed and good salsa bar. A+"}
{"text":"Hands down the best place for tacos around. You got to check this place out. I've never had a bad experience. Really nice staff and great service."}
{"text":"My hubby and I love this little gem! A little pricey for street tacos I feel, but they are worth the splurge! Definitely taste like they were made on a friend's grill out back. Chips and salsa are great too!"}
{"text":"Wow, we loved these tacos!! They were pretty busy the night we stopped in but kept it moving and I didn't starve while waiting:) It was so worth it, the flavors were amazing! I had both the chicken and carne asada, both seasoned perfectly. The salsa bar is stocked with onions, limes, cucumbers, guac, and like 4 different salsas. It was so good, do yourself a favor and try it out! Check in for a free order of chips and salsa:)"}
{"text":"Best asada on the planet. They use prime beef and the freshest ingredients. I eat here 3-4 times a week. I won't eat another taco in Mesa."}
{"text":"The Papa Loca is unique.  It is like a baked potato with taco stuff on top.  It is served in a tinfoil container, and is suited for a fork - not held like a taco.  This is just an explaination - not a complaint.  I did not understand what it was before I ordered one.  It was pretty good, but the potato was WAY overcooked - it was basically mashed potato soup.  The toppings were good, but a bit of gristle in my carne asada was disappointing.  I guess I was expecting more due to the number of five star reviews here on Yelp.

The food was ready quickly - faster than I expected.  When they called my number, I picked up my order but there was no drink.  When I asked the guy behind the counter, he gave me a look that said \"DUH\" and told me to pick up my drink at the other end of the counter.  Not a big deal, but not obvious to me.

The basic tacos (on other patrons' trays) looked big and meaty for the price.  I will probably go back to try these sometime when I am in the area."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Amazing burritos and tacos. Also some of the best horchata! Food is served hot and fresh. They also have a great salsa bar! I usually get the carne asada burrito, sometimes tacos. But also be sure to try their specialty potato!"}
{"text":"I don't typically leave reviews but I felt like I had to so here. 

I placed a take out order and arrived about 20 minutes after calling it in. My food wasn't ready yet and one of the cashiers had to send in the order. So what's the point of takeout? 

Anyway, we sat there for about another 40 minutes thinking they were just too busy (it was packed) to get our order out quickly before we went to check what was going on. At this point they told me they hadn't even started cooking my food. Two of the cashiers then started frantically yelling at me to point out who took my order. I couldn't find the girl, presumably she went outside to clear tables, and they were causing such a scene it was embarrassing. I wasn't even yelling or causing a ruckus myself. It could have been handled a lot more professionally. 

It was maybe another ten minutes before my food was ready. As I was getting the food I pointed out the girl who took my order to the one of the other cashiers and she just said, \"Yeah...\" What was the point of asking me to point her out? They threw in a bag of chips and salsa \"for my trouble\" and that was that. I didn't ask to be compensated, but the lack of professionalism really turned me off ever going back. The food was pretty underwhelming as well. 

Worst service ever."}
{"text":"The place is cute but way 2 busy I felt kinda rushed. They need to get a bigger place ASAP! Good food but I did not relax when eating way to much going on."}
{"text":"Hopefully its just a one off, but service today was terrible. Got the wrong 27 dollar order and had to call back. Didnt go well. Now i have to drop the food off and get the right order. Will it be made right?"}
{"text":"Underwhelmed by this restaurant. It is noisy, crowded and the food is just okay. I had heard so many great things about backyard Taco but it looks like I'm not the only one who is disappointed in the service and food at this location."}
{"text":"Hands down the best tacos in Mesa. I highly recommend them, especially on TACO TUESDAYS! They have really efficient and friendly service, clean cooking area, good lit parking, and plenty of it, and the prices are great!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and fast service considering the wait times!  They know how to keep the menu simple and delicious!  I'm not usually in Mesa, but when I am this place makes a great eat!"}
{"text":"Best taco place ever.
This place is absolutely delicious. Their fast, friendly, affordable,  and perfect to the taste!"}
{"text":"Great prices. Meat was juicy and perfect. Great selection of different salsas and sauces at the salsa bar."}
{"text":"Talk about a waste!!! Ordered a chicken burrito plain with just cheese. They charged 7.95 for the chicken burrito. Then an extra dollar for cheese... now for the stupid part. They charge an additional $1.50 if you are just doing it plain!!! Are you kidding me?!?!? NEVER WASTING MY MONEY HERE AGAIN"}
{"text":"As an out of towner I trusted the high rating and reviews was not dissappointed. Will definitely come back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome food! The place is very chaotic, when it's crowded, but that only shows how popular it is. I always get the amazing carne asada burrito."}
{"text":"Super yummy- fun place!! Great for lunch or dinner! The potatoes are amazing!"}
{"text":"Clean, and fast place. I give it a 4 because I don't think you should have to pay for chips and salsa. The tacos were pretty good. Probably the best authentic tacos in Gilbert (doesn't compare to guero canelo)"}
{"text":"The owners are awesome. Everyone is pretty nice. I like the birria tacos, but the asada and chicken are both great too. To those who say it's in a bad area, they are naive about what a dangerous neighborhood is. No reason to be afraid of the area this is in. No \"symphony of gunshots.\" As another reviewer stated."}
{"text":"had lots of people tell me about this place so my husband and I came to check it out! salsa was good but meat was bland, hard and food was just not that great. To top it off we got sick off this food!! will not be going there anytime soon or ever!"}
{"text":"My favorite neighborhood restaurant. Friendly staff and the great tacos. I love the jalapeno sauce."}
{"text":"Consistently good food, freshly made as you wait.  The salsa bar is a major plus, always fresh and stocked.  My only complaint not, a margarita would make a perfect addition to the menu."}
{"text":"First time there and used the drive thru. Menu is easy and simple. Ordered chicken quesadilla, chicken tacos, carne asada burrito, and chips/salsa. Chicken tacos and chicken quesadilla were dry, little taste, and no sauce or something to moisten it.   Put some picante sauce from home on them and definitely made a difference. Carne asada burrito was fabulous and tasty! Never received the chips and salsa and did not realize it until getting home. Drive thru appeared very busy and rushed to get meals out. Too bad. Good effort but definitely not a place I will go back to. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Great tacos, burritos. Luckily I live close by because my wife I go there all the time."}
{"text":"What's to say? It is one of the best in the Mesa area. The al carbon cooking method really adds that extra flavor to the meat that you can't replicate via another process."}
{"text":"We love this place! My only qualm is, I wish you could go through the salsa line on both sides (it gets crowded when it's busy) the inside is very small, but the food is always good! tastes very fresh"}
{"text":"Had my hopes up for this place based on all the reviews.  It was not as good as I expected it to be.  Very clean restaurant and very nice employees.  However, the food was not as good as I was hoping for.  I ordered 2 chicken tacos and a carne asada quesadilla.  The chicken was rather chewy.  The asada was good.  I would not go to this place again."}
{"text":"Great tacos and great carne asada!! Highly recommend this place. Would suggest passing on the chips and salsa though."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican restaurant in Arizona. Very friendly, excellent service, a wonderful history, and I've never had a bad experience. Highly recommend to all, and Manuela provides remarkable service and is very welcoming. Best there is!"}
{"text":"Terrible disgusting dried out meat, cabbage looked like someone had chewed it up and spit on my plate. The worst part it took 1 full hour to get the two tacos and the carne asada burro. The salas were flavorless.  The building is nice but the food is something else. Never again will we go there, not impressed.  The one star is for the cool building."}
{"text":"This is the real deal. My search is over! No longer need to go Mexico for the original street tacos. We can get them here. The carne asada tacos are my favorite. I had 6 loaded and are a bargain at $1.89 each. Washed them down with a Mexican Coke.. Ahh so good. The birria tacos and papa loca tacos are my next fav. Todo aqui esta muy bueno. Come early as it gets busy quick. Im glad to see they are doing really well. Hopefully they will open a second place soon."}
{"text":"What can I say
..truly authentic....grill fired chicken and beef. The tacos and burritos are fantastic! Friendly staff..this place knows their business..."}
{"text":"Dude! This tacos The best i just drove All The way from Cali to try The quesadillas  so good ill be specting a byt in Cali soon i hope! Go worriors!!!s"}
{"text":"Yummy food! Fast Service! Great prices! Well worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, friendly people and fast service!"}
{"text":"This place is always packed and I don't know why I tried this place got a bunch of different things and this place is absolutely horrible. Nothing special about it the only thing is you'll have to wait forever to get in. horrible food very disappointed in this place Taco Bell has more spices and flavoring in their food than this place does.  You have to be a fool to wait in their lines for white bland food"}
{"text":"What a great taste of the famous Chino's from Rocky Point Mexico
The meat is grilled over mesquite coal the tortilla arr grilled as well 
Theses arr the best street taco in Mesa by far
And i highly recommend this place
This is not a scary hole in the wall

Second trip
Just as good as the first"}
{"text":"I have been a fan of their Mesa location but this does not have the same quality. Had chicken taco, carne asada taco, bean burrito.  Carne Asada was dry.  Chicken was good.  Too much cabbage on the tacos.  Bean burrito was the best thing I had.  Nice smooth beans.  Salsa bar with many choices, avocado salsa is good.  Staff needs some help.  Asked if we could get chips and salsa when ordering and the cashier said \"yes\" but never gave us the chips and salsa.  When we picked up our food they told us to get the chips and salsa from the cashier.  Also when picking up our food they did not have everything ready and when I pointed it out I was told it was all there.  Not until I made them review the order did she agree that food was missing.  Hopefully as this place gets more experience it will improve and live up to their other location.  Until then I will be hitting up a couple other local taco shops."}
{"text":"I need to qualify this whole review by saying I grew up with, literally, backyard grilled carne asada and tacos. Like, every Sunday. So. If you never lived that life, I don't fault you for liking this place. That said, the food is terrible and you can skip the rest of this review. Because the remaining message is for my man, Ruben--the OG owner who started this whole chain:

Ruben, my man. You need to drive your vehicle to the Gilbert location, and spontaneously appear...and start whacking people into shape. Or let your wife do it. Actually, let her do it. Because I *KNOW* she knows that carne is over cooked, fatty, and salty. And we both know that food is haphazardly assembled, even the simplest dishes. Like, how does one mess up a quesadilla, Ruben?! I don't know, but your Gilbert location found a handful of people who figured it out. 

I like your story, Ruben. And your Mesa location still shows me there is hope. Now. I know you got some random people who don't know how to cook trying to help you scale your business. Fine. I'm all about you getting your coins while you kick back. But, don't let those same people try to convince you everyone is coming in all happy and ready to order some papas locas. 

FIX THAT CARNE, RUBEN. My bro and I are right in the hood, so if you need some Chicanos to help, you let us know. We will do some mystery ordering (I'll pay!) and report back to you if the carne is improving. You can categorize it under \"user research.\" Peace, love, and carne."}
{"text":"Good family meal beef tacos! Nice outdoor patio area to sit out on to eat! However too noisy and hot inside the restaurant! Salsa bar is also good as well!"}
{"text":"Love it! I've tried everything they have and my favorite is the asada gorditas.  My children love the tacos de asada. Husband always gets the burrito. I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"El mejor lugar que he encontrado de tacos de carne asada y lo mejor de todo, son al carbón!!!!
El sabor  igualitos a los de mi tierra ya no tengo que esperar a viajar  a Mexico cualquier día de la semana puedo saborear unos verdaderos tacos en verdad deliciosos"}
{"text":"I went to the drive through. The Chicken tacos are dry. The chicken burrito or chicken quesadilla are a better choice. Overall just very average food. I could see myself grabbing a chicken burrito through the drive through in a pinch."}
{"text":"Living in Agritopia, we were so excited for this place to open. We went on opening day, and that was a fiasco. We weren't going to judge on first day performance. We went back tonight- about 2 months after opening. Plenty of time to work some of the kinks out. 

SERVICE: While the line moved quickly, we ordered chips and salsa with the meal. Unbeknownst to us the cashier was supposed to give them to us after we paid, which she didn't and didn't give us our drink cup either. When our number was finally called, I noticed the chips and salsa weren't on the tray, so I asked the expo who called our number where the chips and salsa were. She said, \"the cashier is supposed to give those to you.\" And I said, \"well she didn't, so what would you like me to do?\" Her reply, \"go ask the cashier.\" Meanwhile, the cashiers had lines 10 people deep and I had to wait again to ask the cashier for something she should have given us to start with. Major fail on the cashier AND the expo's part. But sounds more like a training issue to me. 

FOOD: Just ok. Not earth shattering flavor as expected. Ordered two steak tacos, one shredded beef taco, two bean and cheese gorditas and a pint of beans... and chips/salsa. The beans were nice and flavorful, but the streak meat was very, very tough, and dry. All in all, we ate the chip/salsa and beans. The tacos went into the trash unfortunately. I am not a fan of gnawing on tough meat. I will say the salsa bar was nicely stocked and included a guacamole purée. 

OVERALL: This was really unfortunate because it literally took us three minutes to walk from our house. Probably will not be back unless we're starving or hear about major improvements in the food. Sorry BYT, just being honest."}
{"text":"Simply excellent street taco's. Both the pollo and carne asada were tender and delicious. When I'm on that end of town, I'll be back! Only drawback - super loud music playing in the lobby which was too overbearing for the small space."}
{"text":"Really liked this place. They have the best Carne Asada in Mesa. Very tender and not dry and tough like most taco shops. 1.70 per taco or you can get a full family meal for $16. I wish they could make a half meal for 2 people. Other than that if you like street tacos this place is really good."}
{"text":"Found Backyard Tacos on Yelp and decided to try it out while in town. Awesome local shop delivering some seriously good tacos. A++"}
{"text":"I like it. Meat was a little grisly but other than that, I was impressed. Good job on this one guys."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped here to try some tacos and the carne asada seemed very dry and chewy. The salsas were good but the tacos were a little disappointing."}
{"text":"There are few places we frequent, and this is one of them. A couple of notes - we think the horchata is grainy, don't care for the chips much, and they often get some part of our order wrong, but we don't care. The grilled meats are awesome. We keep coming back. And recently we learned they have a frequent eater punch card. Yay! They are busy all the time. So nice to see a local.business doing so well!"}
{"text":"By far, some of the best tacos I have ever had.  Every time we visit the Phoenix area, this is a must stop.  The service is fast, considering how packed this place can get."}
{"text":"Backyard Taco has brought out the worst behavior in me.  The carne asada is to blame! (It's the best in town and I'm hopelessly addicted.) The other day when my wife excused herself from the table where we were enjoying takeout from Backyard Taco to answer the door, I took a big bite of her carne asada burrito.  She came back and looked at me askance but I blamed it on the dog. I think she knew I was lying. (Oh, help me!)  Even worse when my toddler son came up to me and asked for a bite of my taco I told him, \"Get lost kid!\" It may be a sin, but that carne asada made me do it. Hands down the best tacos and burritos in town.  It'll drive a good man bad!"}
{"text":"Best tacos in mesa! Chill environment, good service, food is bomb! I would recommend this place to everyone"}
{"text":"It's a taco. I'm not sure what all the amazing comments are about. They are okay not amazing.  I guess I'm not a big taco fanatic. It took them about 10 minutes to make a couple of tacos. Place was packed full of people. Had no place to sit. It was loud and crazy. I'll give it another try eventually."}
{"text":"I really loved the tacos from here. I ordered the shredded beef and the chicken street tacos and they were both really good!  I'm definitely coming back for more. I love that they have a drive thru too."}
{"text":"Place does not have rice. Pretty standard carne taco with flour or corn tortillas. Don't go here if your used to having all of the fixins on your burrito when I asked for lettuce in mine they looked around and didn't know if they could do that. They do have beans and didn't know if that could go in the burrito either."}
{"text":"Love this place. Best tacos in town."}
{"text":"Good food, though the tacos aren't the most filling per each, then again their tacos taste great."}
{"text":"We come here quiet often for taco Tuesday and LOVE it! Tried just about everything on the menu and haven't had anything we didn't like! They're fast when they're not busy and when it is busy it's just a little bit longer wait. Free chips and salsa when you check in on yelp. Good vibe and nice clean restaurant!"}
{"text":"Did not enjoy...sorry. Too many flies and perhaps one of the reasons I suffered with food poisoning. Will not return. Peace out"}
{"text":"Best tacos in Mesa AZ!! you have to try! Always great service by the owner and his wife! salsa is amazing always very clean AND ALWAYS FRESH FOOD"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time today, the tacos were very good the salsa was tasty as well as other condiments on the salsa bar."}
{"text":"This place is flat out delicious. Always lines but the move threw them fast. Can't wait for the chandler location with a drive threw"}
{"text":"No to the bean burrito, but yes to the beef and steak tacos! Say goodbye to places like Taco Bell. Once you've eaten here, you will never want to visit another fast food taco place again."}
{"text":"Will not return. I really like a good taco, but the meat in these seemed to be some sort of processed meat that had little or no taste. Why not use regular ground beef? The place was packed when it opened and now it's slowing down a lot, and I can see why. It's just not good food in my opinion. I am surprised at some of the 5 star ratings. I'm disappointed because it's down the street from my house. I'll have to open my own taco store or maybe a Taco Truck. Also, people in the east Valley always flock to grand openings, therefore big crowds during opening month doesn't necessarily translate to good food and service - just a mad rush try something new. \"To each his own\". I'm sure there will be plenty of parking as time goes on."}
{"text":"Yummy street tacos, chicken was my favorite. I only gave 3 stars because the service was subpar at best. I wasn't sure if it was just a one off, but same thing in the next visit. Just a smile and your welcome goes a looong way!"}
{"text":"Waited in line for 20 minutes to order our food. Then waited 50 minutes to get it! These are street tacos! Don't go here until they get it together. Or maybe when there is no line? Food was good except for the giant piece of fat in my carne asada. Stick with the shredded beef."}
{"text":"Love this place...thankfully it's close because there aren't too many options around for a quick bite to eat in a nice atmosphere!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy. This place is crowded because everyone one else knows they're yummy too! The food is amazing and the vibe is very relaxed."}
{"text":"Great little Mexican food place!  Pretty close to the real thing, but they also add a few twists which are quite tasty!"}
{"text":"Really like Backyard Taco! I order 4 carne asada tacos every time. Just the right amount to fill you up. I tried the chicken which was good, but I prefer the steak. The tacos come with tiny bit of diced red onion and cabbage, and you can add cheese for 25 cents if you'd like. They have a \"salad bar\" of toppings and salsas, not a huge selection but does the job. You can ask for a grilled jalapeño if you like spicy. Their horchata was lacking imo though."}
{"text":"I'm Italian (my grandparents immigrated to the US in the 1920s) but I've lived in Arizona for the past 21 years and have a great appreciation for Mexican food.  My wife is an Arizona native who grew up on authentic Mexican food. I also spent my summers in high school in Cabo San Lucas in the late 80's, early 90's; so I've had exposure to traditional Mexican cuisine. 

We both agree these are some the best tacos we've ever had!  I don't usually eat carne asada, but their steak is awesome; finely chopped, grilled, and seasoned.  The chicken tacos are awesome as well.  One reviewer compared this to Chipolte, no way, not even close.  This is close to traditional but with a twist.  

The crazy potato with chicken, the quesadilla with chicken, and steak tacos are the best!  Their mild jalapeno sauce is fantastic.

We've eaten here at least 10 times in the last month.  I would give them 5 stars but my only complaint are the flies in the restaurant, they need to invest in some of those blue lights, the flies can get obnoxious.  And, it can get a little pricey, but I still think these are the best tacos around!             
."}
{"text":"Awesome and amazing food. Always expect a line but the food is totally worth it. The jalapeño sauce is awesome."}
{"text":"This place was amazing the first time we had it. We've only had it one more time since and some of the meat was poor quality. In my own opinion, the food does not justify the price you pay."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday, anyone? Well make that Taco Thursday, too! That's when I discovered this lovely place. My friends and I was craving somewhere yummy yet affordable since our paychecks didn't roll in yet. My bestie and her husband actually discovered this place 2 days prior after working out at LA Fitness next door and they were like let's go back! 
They wanted to go right after they went; that I must check out. 
It was cute little place; even my friend was like, \"You know this is an euthentic place when there is a chihuahua roaming around.\" No joke; there was a chihuahua just roaming abouts; super cute. 
Their prices were super doable; a taco for $1.50 and it's not like the ones from taco bell? I went crazy. I had three tacos, one quesadilla, horchata and (since I Yelp) got a side of chips and salsa for free at check-in (so CHECK-IN). I was soooo full after half of my quesadilla and 2nd taco but I kept going because it was so good. We went at around 6PM and the sun was still out. There are sprinklers outside so it did not feel too hot; very nice actually. 
Only complain I have is probably the salsa bar. It was small and wish there was another one so everyone didn't have to crowd that one table in the corner next to the salsa bar."}
{"text":"Wait is still really long. The food tastes different for the other back yard taco place. Not sure if I am digging it. Ps. Parking is a nightmare. Who ever designed that place needs a head check. Poor other business around there :("}
{"text":"Delicious tacos!  The carne asada was delicious and cooked perfect. Nice and friendly staff."}
{"text":"You won't be disappointed! It is busy all the time for a reason! Everything is fresh and yummy."}
{"text":"Real Mexican style tacos and my type of hot sauce (very spicy). Don't miss taco Tuesday (discounted tacos) and be sure to try their Papas Locas which are basically potatoes stuffed with chicken, beef or pork."}
{"text":"Great place for tacos. A must try. They have a special on tacos on Tuesday's from 2-9pm. The pastor was okay. The asada was the best. The Gordita was good, I got soft and crunchy. It smells great and this place is constantly flowing with people."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos! We ordered so much food and it was all so worth it. The portions were great- beans were cheesy and salsa had heat.  Can't really ask for much more."}
{"text":"Great Carne Asada and Chicken Tacos. 
Simple menu, REALLY well prepared food.
Salsa and Condiment Bar was a win. 
Crowded interior (because the food is so good)"}
{"text":"Decent street tacos. I used to actually go to the owners house on the weekends when they were actually doing the restaurant in their backyard. Prices have gone up, as I knew they would. Service about the same. Very basic place, few bells and whistle. Would really only go on Tuesday, value wise that when you will get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this while in town visiting Family, and boy am I glad! FOOD WAS AWESOME!, establishment was extremely clean, and prices were in line. Make sure you try the Salsa Bar!"}
{"text":"The food was good and inexpensive. I didn't love the chips, but the salsa and all the hot sauces were delicious.  Cheese quesadilla was what you would expect- very average. The chicken and al pastor tacos were very good- I really enjoyed them.  The toppings in addition to the meat are what make them delicious. I would definitely go here again if I were in the area.  Service was friendly and quick!"}
{"text":"Delicious tacos! The owner is a super nice guy.. you do have to pay for chips, which I think would be nice to throw in for free. A lot of times you have to ask them to clean a table off for you, the teens working there aren't very good at staying on top of keeping the dining area clean. I would recommend though, the al pastor tacos are great!"}
{"text":"The BEST... Need I say more! 


We found this little  gem, and we have not stopped coming, Even when it isn't Taco Tuesday!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Custom service is number one! Beyond happy with this place. And great food and cheap prices!!! My new number one Mexican food place"}
{"text":"First time eating here and food was amazing!! Cassandra was our server and she was helpful and was very knowledgeable. She along with the rest of the staff take pride in providing customer service. I will definitely be back ."}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere and great food. Probably the best salsa bar you'll find in a fast-casual restaurant. The meat can be hit or miss depending on your taste but it's all good quality ingredients and made quickly. My only complaint is that at times there isn't enough seating. Other than that this place is a staple."}
{"text":"Love Backyard Taco! Such good prices and such amazing food! I've seen a ton of different taco shops come and go through this little building. But guaranteed this one will be staying for years and years to come. The decor and style is cool and the patio is enjoyable even in the summer!"}
{"text":"I would definitely recommend Backyard Tacos, service is friendly, food is great. I generally get the Carney Asada tacos, chips and salsa."}
{"text":"We were disappointed.  Meat a bit tough on the tacos.  Little cheese on the quesadilla.  No plans to return."}
{"text":"I tried one of each Taco (chicken, birria, and carne asada). The chicken & carne tacos were awesome, however I wasn't the biggest fan of the Birria taco. Use the check in offer and get free chips & salsa, definitely a plus! Finally, don't forget to get a Mexican coke, they're the best of you like Coca-Cola!"}
{"text":"We moved to Mesa a little over 2 years ago, and this is the only restaurant we go to over and over again. The tacos are DELICIOUS! And the horchata is some of the best I've had (if you like it sweet and very cinnamon-y!). Whenever we have friends or family in town, we take them here day 1, and they always want to go back a second time during their stay."}
{"text":"It's nice living close to this place! Really good tacos, quesadillas and salsas. I always ask for cheese in my tacos though. Weird they don't come with cheese."}
{"text":"Between the two main choices for meat, chicken or steak, the chicken is best hands down. Neat atmosphere, friendly staff, and clean environment. Worth trying the papa locas, my kids prefer the vegetarian option."}
{"text":"I had the crazy potato (steak) and a couple of their steak tacos. To be honest, it's all small portions and not the greatest flavors I would have expected. Service was excellent though, just wish I would have known how small the tacos were, I would have bought more. I definitely left hungry."}
{"text":"Drove from Goodyear and well worth the drive....had birra and carne asada tacos, everything taste as if it was just made in other words fresh. Will definitely be returning.....two words salsa bar (birra sauce) also two words...you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Feels very welcoming. The staff is friendly and helpful with choices. The food is very affordable & high quality. I couldn't believe the size of the stuffed baked potato I got! Everything was delicious. Went with a group of 4 friends, each ordering something different, each loving what they ordered. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"first visit here and my first success at having my autistic daughter eat a taco. she has a fear of lettuce and Backyard taco doesn't use lettuce but cabbage instead. we had chicken soft street tacos, carne asada tacos, and both in quesadellia form. The pico/salsa bar was tiny but delicious and the fresh lemonade was the best I've ever had. A bit expensive for my single mom budget (17.50 for 2, no desert) but hey it was Cinco de Mayo and we wanted to celebrate with some wicked good food. Not disappointed!  It was busy for dinner, but easy parking, quick order and production, and very clean."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in Mesa.  It has a very homie feel, it is a family oriented place and the service is definitely on fleek(meaning they have fast service). Back yard Tacos definitely are one of those mom and pop shops or hole in the wall kind of places. This spot should be on the top 10 go to places for, Taco Tuesday's or any other day for Mexican food/BBQ."}
{"text":"AmAzInG... ummmm well worth the crowd, my husband had the tacos I had a bean burrito  WOW it was filling :)"}
{"text":"Best tacos in Arizona.
We got the Crazy potato and pollo/Asada tacos! Every bite of everything is amazing.
Best hidden treasure in Mesa by far! They are fairly newer and super cute ambiance. The customer service is excellent and in the small joint they have about a dozen people working constantly keeping those lines flowing.
We will certainly be back... With more people!"}
{"text":"Today was my first visit to Backyard Taco. Opening Day!! We live about 1/2 mile away so couldn't wait. It's a beautiful restaurant and great location!! They have indoor seating as well as a big patio and a drive thru. 

They have Tacos, Burritos, Quesadillas, Tostadas, and Gorditas. This is counter service type of a place. They have a salsa bar as well. They serve Coke products, Gold Peak Teas and some Aqua Frescas. Yummy Horchata. 

I got the Shredded Beef Gordita, the Gordita is like a thick corn tortilla. It's not like a Taco Bell one. I also got a chicken taco on a flour tortilla. The flower tortilla was fresh and tasted homemade. 
We also got beans and chips, nothing fancy about the beans. 

My Son and Husband got the Carne Asada, OMG it was Soooo good. We took off the cabbage and Pico and tomatoe sauce. Just meat, beans and cheese. 

The salsas are great and the green one taste like a avocado sauce. 

Opening day was busy and took 40 min to get our meals, I think this is expected for a crazy busy line. We will be back. Also see that they do Taco Tuesday 2-10pm

How it could be better:
Have Napkins by Salsa Bar and not hidden by Soda Machine. 
Free refills on Aqua Frescas 
Offer Rice 
Serve breakfast burritos 
Offer a menu with details of ingredients on each item 
Show extras available like Sour Cream, Guacamole ect 
Offer a frequent visit punch card"}
{"text":"I don't understand all the high ratings. The food is twice as expensive as Taco Bell and half as good. It's all hype and reminds me of the Emperor's new clothes. Just because there's a line doesn't mean it's any good in spite of what's being said."}
{"text":"Came to AZ with the goal of trying as many tacos as humanly possible and find the best taco. Backyard tacos is my number 1 after trying ~ 12 places total. 

Get the orcheta (sp?) it's a nutmeg/cinnamon flavored milk. Amazing. 

Owner is super friendly, ask him how he started the place."}
{"text":"Best tacos ever wouldn't wanna go anywhere else. These tacos are the shit!! Always come in and enjoy the food, service is fast and the carne Asada is crispy! Can't wait for them to open the stapley location!"}
{"text":"Wow 

Really good place.  Many different tacos to choose from.

Fresh salsa bar was excellent.

Fast and way friendly.

I recommend to all who visit and will be Back."}
{"text":"I don't know what the hype is about. I've had better Mexican food. Heck, I think Chipotle is better than here. The food is okay. I ordered the carne asada burrito. The meat was very fatty but not seasoned well. But the deal breaker for me are the amount of flies in this place. They are everywhere. Flying around their kitchen, to their salsa bar, to your plate. Grossed me out. Won't be back."}
{"text":"This place has THE BEST tacos.  I have been to other taco bars in the area and this by far takes the cake.  Their tacos are delicious, I usually get the carne asada.  Some salsa with a squeeze of lime, they're perfect.  I wish it was closer to my house but I don't mind the drive for these babies.  Give this place a try! =)"}
{"text":"Teeth beware!  Ate some tacos and about broke my teeth on a couple of large pieces of bone in the chicken tacos.  When I showed it to the manager he laughed. He later came by with a $10 gift certificate??  Although the beef taco had a good flavor to it, I probably won't be back as their attention to detail in the kitchen and my love of my teeth don't align. I've had far better Mexican food where my safety isn't laughed at."}
{"text":"This place was voted #1 in the area. I may be biased as I'm from San Diego where Mexican food is excellent but I thought the food was awful. The carne asada tasted like unseasoned hamburger and was only topped with cabbage, yes, cabbage. Salsa was sub par at best. I don't recommend it."}
{"text":"I had high hopes, but the food & service left me underwhelmed. The wait was long and the staff wasn't organized."}
{"text":"We were in Mesa for a concert and wanted to grab dinner first. Tacos are never a bad idea so we landed at Backyard Taco! The menu is straightforward- I had carne Asada tacos, my husband had a burrito. Everything was delicious and really hit the spot. It was super busy but plenty of seating. Lots of salsa options, quick service. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"The bean burritos and carne asada tacos are great. Carne asada burritos are delicious too but I'd recommend a side of carne asada meat w the bean burrito. The carne asada burritos are just too big for me! Plus I love the beans in the burrito. I hope they stay at their location for a long time cuz I think I saw another location opening up. They have improved the food choices in this north Mesa neighborhood."}
{"text":"Carne asada was good. Good flavor. not cheap.  the layout is good when its slow, but its a little bit jacked up when there are more people in there. You sort of get lost going from ordering to salsa bar when its busy. It took me a solid 10 minutes to get salsa, my bad?"}
{"text":"Great tacos but NO BEER!  I hear the other location has brew.  Super crowded but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Sorry negative reviewers. You have no idea what you're taking about. Backyard Taco is one of the best, authentic taco outfits around. If you happen upon the original location on University, you'll see that it is always packed. There's a reason for it. I've been to the Gilbert location, and to be honest, was a bit nervous that it may lack the quality of the original, But not at all. They prepare meats and ingredients the same way, with the same taste. 

This place is awesome. Far from \"white people\" tacos that another reviewer claimed them to be."}
{"text":"Friend took me there recently and I had one of their pollo burritos. It was amazing! That's really all I can say. I wish there was one closer to me."}
{"text":"It's a must go. Got one of each tacos. Flavor is amazing. I think everyone should try this place. You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"I recently placed a catering order with Adelys, a manager, at the Gilbert location. She was very helpful & made excellent recommendations. I highly recommend this restaurant & most especially the catering options. Thank you Adelys for making my life easier!!!"}
{"text":"Came here today on the recommendation of Dee at the wallpaper market, located across the street, inside Creative Home Fabrics. (Little shout out there for Dee's business)  Dee says she gets so hungry when she comes in early because the delicious smell of fresh grilling meat is overwhelming.  I went, ordered lunch to go. It was good.  Steak quesadilla was soaking in grease . I had to take a napkin and soak up the grease.  I ordered 3 steak tacos, and 3 chicken tacos. Good. Had to add a lot of salt and pepper to really enjoy them. The crazy potato with steak was good. I love that they have coke products, styrofoam cups and pellet ice. 

Love the cucumbers at salsa bar. 

The place is darling. Very very clean, was PACKED at 12:30pm.  Lots of clean cut business people and elders  ( missionaries) eating here.  It had a really nice \" boutique-ee feel to it. 


The background story is cute and inspiring. 

The food was good and the place cute and really clean. . I would not drive out of my way to eat here, but would definitely return if I happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"We waited 25 minutes for our food two quesadillas and three tacos only to have it be Luke warm and you had to look extremely hard to find any cheese on our stuffed steak quesadilla and our plain cheese quesadilla... super disappointed as we had heard so many wonderful things about this place.  The staff were nice but when we asked cashier about things on menu she just kept saying I don't really know.. all I kept thinking was neither do I ..."}
{"text":"I remember going to Backyard Taco when it was actually in a backyard. (I know, I know, what a hipster thing to say.) Back then, I enjoyed the food but the wait and service were hardly worth it (granted, it was someone's backyard, so I couldn't really complain). So while I was anxious to try out the new restaurant, I approached it with a fair amount of skepticism.

Sure, my first time there the food took a while. The restaurant had just opened so I imagine they had some bugs to work out. I've been back several times and the food arrives much quicker.

Portion wise, don't expect much from the tacos; they are very small. I'm not against small tacos, not one bit, I'm just against not getting my money's worth. For their size, you'd expect to pay a bit less. That said, they're quite tasty so the price doesn't keep me from ordering a couple each time I go. Get a quesadilla if you want more bang for your buck.

I give points to any restaurant that serves bottled Mexican Coke. I'd love it if they ditched their fountain drinks all together for a better variety of bottle sodas (there are so many great Mexican sodas) but I'm likely one of the few who thinks that way. (To be honest, I'd love it if every restaurant went this route.)

The clean and simple design of the restaurant is nice.

This is certainly not the best taco joint in the Valley, but I love having a solid original, non-chain restaurant so close to where I work (there are so few food options in this part of Mesa). I've seen a couple different restaurants pass through this building while living in Mesa. Here's hoping Backyard Taco sticks around."}
{"text":"Great food, great price, and fun atmosphere. Love this place! My favorite is the Loco Potato with carne asada. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Yes I am going to tell you that I ate this food when they actually served it in a backyard. It's a funny story. I had a friend take me and I thought he was out if his mind as we walked into some random empty looking backyard for some Mexican food. Hahaha it turned out to be pretty busy in the back.


Now the review.

Great food. Good prices. Friendly people. They can be slow at times but other than that it's great."}
{"text":"I recently had lunch here with a few friends. Even though they were really busy  our order was taken quickly and our meals were ready way sooner than expected. The food was great and the atmosphere was pleasant. I definitely recommend anyone who enjoys Mexican food to try this place out."}
{"text":"Ordered tacos for our company party today.  Arrived and parked in the 5 minute take-out spot and was in and out in less than 4 minutes.  Cashier had my order ready and everything  went smoothly.  Meats were fresh and everything tasted great.  All the employees filled their bellies.  We will definitely be coming back for more."}
{"text":"My husband and I love tacos, and we decided to wait in the crazy long line to get some. We weren't impressed. The selection seemed neat, But the meat wasn't seasoned well, and nothing really stood out about the meal. It was like literally going to a friends house and having so-so tacos in the backyard."}
{"text":"TLDR; Great food. Not so great service.

I've been seeing this place on all my friends' Snapchat stories and Instagrams so I had to try it! On a Thursday afternoon, around 1:30, there was no line so we got our food rather quickly. We ordered a shredded beef quesadilla, large horchata, beans, chips/salsa, and tacos on flour: 3 chicken, 2 al pastor, 1 steak, and 2 shredded beef. The steak was tender and perfect with just the right toppings in the taco. The beef tacos were not our favorite...it was just plain. The seasoning on the al pastor was amazing. One of my favorite parts about eating here was the salad and salsa bar. UNLIMITED PLAIN GUAC!!!! I loaded up on cucumbers and radish and tons of different salsas to accompany my tacos.

Although we had a great time at this place, there were a few complaints. The girl who took our order was vegetarian so when we had questions about the types of meat or recommendations, it was quite awkward. I know it's not her fault but I wish that someone who could relate would be the one taking the orders. Secondly, the meat in some of the tacos was cold. We were told to take it back, but it seemed like the meat was just topped with  more cold meat. Kinda sad but I guess it happens."}
{"text":"What can u say ??? Great food awesome taste but something is missing?? The price was little high paid almost 30 bucks for me and my wife. Where I could of got a lot more food somewhere else. However if the quality was not tasty I would of gave this place a 1 out of 5 stars. It's a one time thing maybe next year I come again the prices really had me only come once to the great place."}
{"text":"This is a great place too eat.they have a huge variety of food and everything is great. My favorite is the burrito, its size is great and tastes even better"}
{"text":"Used to go to the original location in Mesa and this one opened up by me about a month ago. Just like I used to do at the old location, I called in my order for lunch and picked it up 15 minutes later. I was in and out in about 3 minutes. Food was amazing as always. I'm glad I called in my order because the line to order was out the door and who knows how long the wait was!"}
{"text":"Considering I'm from California and we have amazing taco shops and being super close to the border we cross over to enjoy our tacos. However, I had the free chips and salsa when checking in and I asked for everything on the side and they gave me my tacos with everything on top AND my tacos we're super cold. I'm not sure if it was because of the rush hour but regardless my food should've been warm and well cooked. I don't think I will be going back to this place. Not to mention: I waited 20 minutes to order my food and 15 to get to the salsa bar and I paid for the tacos. So all of my 10 tacos were so not worth it."}
{"text":"Stumbled into this place simply by chance and wasn't disappointed. The crazy potatoes are just amazing."}
{"text":"I don't know what took me so long to try this place that's just five minutes from home. Flavor of the carne asada tacos is outstanding.  I found it impossible to eat the tacos the way tacos should be eaten.  Both of the soft corn  kept falling apart before reaching my mouth.  So what I ended up eating was a pile of carne asada, broken up  tortillas with all the condiments and salsa, that required fork and spoon.  It was mid-morning Saturday and they were busy.  I will eat their food again because it tastes delicious but will phone in my order to go, in the future."}
{"text":"From the first tome my family and I walked in to Backyard Taco in Gilbert the warm welcome by Ruben and the the team has been beyond amazing.
The best part is the experience each time we go ion is just as good. Mary is amazing! Whether she's on drive up or the register at the counter her smile is on and she's always gracious!  The entire team is courteous and always in a good mood even when it's busy!
Keep doing what you are doing guys.
The food is amazing and the service experience is top notch all the time, every time!
The Shipman's Love Backyard Taco!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite taco shops around. If you're looking for great street style tacos and a good selection of salsas this is the spot to be. Been here on multiple occasions each time with satisfaction. Also have a drive through if you want to get them to go."}
{"text":"BEST TACOS IN PHOENIX, yeah I said it...let me say it again. BEST TACOS IN PHOENIX!! If you live in the West valley and you want to drive an hour for some good tacos I suggest you make that trip because it's worth it. The tacos here live up to its name, it taste fresh like it was cooked in your own back yard. The kitchen here is open so you can see the meats being grilled, chopped, and served to you. They have the grill right behind the cashier so you can see your meat being cooked as you order. They also have a fresh salsa bar that comes with different types of salsa, red onions, cucumbers and radish. You need to try this place you won't regret it. While everything here is good what I usually go back for is below.
My order:
Crazy papas with al pastor - double mashed stuffed potatoes with your meat of choice (I choose al pastor) served with chopped cabbage, red onions, and melted cheese.
Chicken quesadilla - melted cheese with chicken on flour tortilla. Can't go wrong with this!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I have been going there since the beginning in the backyard and am stoked that they built this one so close to my house. My go to is the carne asada quesadilla and then load it up with guacamole, lime and salsa. You really can't go wrong with anything you order though. I definitely recommend this place to everyone I know."}
{"text":"I've never heard of Backyard Taco.  We literally saw it on the left side of the street as we were driving through Gilbert so we decided to stop.  Immediately upon walking in we noticed there was nowhere to sit inside.  It was a pretty packed house.  We skimmed the menu a bit and noticed a picture of a \"Stuffed\" steak quesadilla scroll across the screen so we decided to go with a Cheese Quesadilla and a Steak/Carne Asada Quesadilla. 

It didn't take long for our order to arrive. While we waited we made our way to the condiment station.  I grabbed the pickled onions, cucumbers and guacamole salsa. I was about to grab a bit of the hot salsa when a lady warned me that it was really hot!  I tried a little, and she was right!  It was too hot for me.  My boyfriend thought it was fine. 

Once we received our food, we sat outside because again it was packed inside, nowhere to sit at all.  I was disappointed in the presentation and quality of the food.  For starters, my \"stuffed\" steak quesadilla wasn't stuffed at all, nor was it folded and grilled shut.  It wasn't a quesadilla in fact, it was a steak taco but bigger.  I brought this to the worker's attention and she said this is how our quesadillas are.  Mine had nothing but chewy, cold steak and onions.  (See enclosed picture).  My boyfriend's cheese quesadilla looked more like a children's food menu item but he said it was tasty. Because I've personally heard good things about this place from co-workers and friends, I'd like to try it again.  I'll stick with street tacos next time.  

Before writing this review I checked out the website and menu online.  The minute the page loads up you see a picture of a delicious looking, stuffed quesadilla.  Just like the item I \"thought\" I was orderly.  They should really change the pictures of the food items because it's so deceiving."}
{"text":"Soooo good!! I loved this place. The steak tacos were my very favorite. Parking is limited but it was so so worth it."}
{"text":"The best chicken quesadilla I've had in my life.  The tastes were wonderful...  the salsa bar has radishes & cucumbers, which is a plus for me every time."}
{"text":"The presentation made the tacos look like they would be amazing, but they were disappointing. The meat was rather chewy and lacked flavor. I don't see what all the hype is about."}
{"text":"Love the food. Wish it was closer to Tempe. And wish the employees would smile a bit. They are nice. Just don't seem very happy"}
{"text":"Outstanding food!  Really cool place, the indoor/outdoor set up has a great feel.  We had the carne asada, birria, and chicken tacos and gorditas.. legit!!  I didn't see any combo platers, that would be a nice option, but not a big deal.  We'll absolutely be going back."}
{"text":"Went here the first time and had a chicken baked potato and it was good.  Went back a second time and the chicken mix they used was disgusting.  It was very grizzly due to cartilage pieces.  Yuck!  It was good the first time so might give it another shot but going to wait a while."}
{"text":"Really good smoky flavored meat.  Not your normal Mexican restaurant nor BBQ but something in between.  I tried something completely different - a baked potato (with smoked meat) cheese and sour cream, all wrapped up in a foil pouch to eat like a snow cone.  Yummy!! . 

Best time to visit is during cooler months so you can comfortably sit outside at picnic tables."}
{"text":"We go to backyard taco about once a week. If you have a gluten allergy, this is the place to go!
They have very savory meat, with lots of options. I really enjoyed the gordita which is a fried corn base. It's not like a taco, it's really thick.
The only downside is the place is it's always booked. There will be a long line in the car drive-through, and a long line inside. Keep in mind that they are very fast at getting to your order and your food out to you.
The patio is really cool. They have heaters in the winter, and it's a great place to spend an evening. Very kid friendly as well!"}
{"text":"I live in the area and might be a little bit obsessed with these tacos. I haven't eaten anything other than the regular tacos--I'm not terribly adventurous with food and when I find something I like I just keep ordering it. :-) 

I'm so glad I found this place awhile back--the mesquite grilled meat is delicious, they are friendly and even when I go and there is a line practically out the door they are quick and I never have to wait longer than what I consider normal for super busy times."}
{"text":"Excelente taco muy buen sabor a carbon y son rápidos atendiendo a los clientes muy bien jugó de limón natural ."}
{"text":"Amazing place. Love the tacos, love the burritos. Employees are awesome. Will forever come back!!!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place out! I work out next door and I always see how busy this place is... unfortunately when I went it wasn't that great..... I explained to the cashier it was our first time and needed help ordering... she was no help... then I ordered a bunch of random stuff... got back to the table... started eating... 

The meat was so fatty... every taco tasted the same... and the salsa... YUCK! 

I probably won't be back to try it again... sorry!"}
{"text":"Food is great   But they need a larger place !!!! Also you can't eat outside during the summer!!!!"}
{"text":"I like the Mesa location way better. The drive thru experience was the worst ever and it was super hard to communicate with the person taking the order. The tacos were cold when I go home so maybe a better idea to eat them there unless they were already cold when they packed it. No toppings either so no salsa or cilantro and all the toppings that make a good taco. I probably won't ever go back to the Mesa location either because of this visit."}
{"text":"Good place for taco Tuesday. Tacos are 1.50 and taste good. Choice between grilled steak, chicken, and birria. Horchata was good. The place was super busy, I will definitely be back to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh!  BEST carne asada in the East Valley!!!  Great service, great food, awesome prices!  Doesn't get better than this!"}
{"text":"I'm revisiting my review now that it's safe to say I've had everything on the menu. Where has this Crazy Potato been all my life? (Papa Loca) I was in Backyard Taco and the owner himself took my order and introduced me to a new stampcard. Buy 10, get 1 meal free (up to $5). My guess is, I will have filled this card in about two weeks. My favorite items are the tacos on corn tortillas, the steak tostada and now the potato. The chips and salsa are delicious as well, and complimentary with your Yelp check-in. Great that they're open late, too."}
{"text":"Love this place. I go to the one on University Dr. In Mesa. Best street tacos in the east valley."}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite place for tacos. This place is ALWAYS packed but let me tell you, it is worth the wait. The food is perfect every time. A huge quesadilla for the price. I usually get the steak tacos and quesadilla. There's several salsas to choose from, all delicious. The only downfall is limited indoor space."}
{"text":"Backyard taco one of our favorite places to go. If u crave Mexican food go here you'll thank me later after your first bite. You'll probably get addicted, I'm not sorry you're welcome for making your life better ;)"}
{"text":"This is a review on the management at the Mesa location, NOT the food -

I placed a large order for my company lunch today, and I called the order to the Mesa location yesterday afternoon to give them plenty of time to prepare it. They said to call back tomorrow morning (today) with payment info. 

Today I called back at 10:15am, the girl I spoke with confirmed back to me the same order that I placed yesterday, I gave her our company credit card info and she said we were good to go, order will be ready at 11:30am.

About a hour and half later I came by to scoop up the order. When I came in, I gave the girls behind the counter my name and said I was there picking up the large order that was placed yesterday & paid for this morning. One of the girls said she remembered the order that I placed last night but she told me they canceled it because no one called to pay for it? I told her I called around 10:15 with payment, she looked to the other girls behind the counter and said \"we've been here all day and haven't received any calls\". The girl I was speaking with was named Cindy, she said she was the manager. 

I was confused so I checked my phone to see what number I had called. (There is a Gilbert location also so I thought maybe I dialed the wrong one). I read the number I called back to Cindy to confirm it was correct - she confirmed it was.  I have record of a 1 minute 36 second convo at 10:15am from when I made the payment. I asked her to check her caller ID to see if she had record of the call from me - she started flipping through the call log, she set the phone down after about 1 minute and asked me what I had ordered yesterday. I said \"...did you see a call from me today?\" she said \"no\". She was clearly lying to cover up for their error. Cindy tried to come up with potential reasons why it might have been my fault but I disproved every single one. And even still, she showed no remorse for their mess up. Meanwhile my hungry co workers are sending me texts asking when they tacos are coming! 

This kind of treatment and behavior from Cindy, the manager, stood out as extremely unprofessional. They failed to process a large order, which I gave them plenty of time to prepare. People make mistakes & I understand this of course. But instead of offering an apology or a solution she tried to make me feel like an idiot. I was not pleased. I had no choice but to re-order & re-pay and sit there and wait for it to be done. I won't know until Monday if charged me for 2 orders. 

I now have a bad taste in my mouth about this place and it's not because of the food. What a shame."}
{"text":"As an out of town visitor from Chicago where we are privileged to have a few delicious Mexican joints, I was quite impressed with this location. The location is right off the street which I was concerned about, given that I intended to eat in their outside patio; however the patio is shielded. There are very limited tables at the patio but plenty of individual bar seating on the sides of the patio. Unsure if due to being very busy, there was no one ensuring the tables at the patio remained clean, so I did have to clean our table before siting. There were about five people ahead of our group, but the line moved quickly. The \"al carbon\" (English- open flame grilling) cooking style adds quite a unique flavor to the meat. I tried the pastor (pork) and asada (steak) tacos and was very satisfied with the price and portion of food. There is a salsa and cucumber side table available with multiple salsa choices (ranging from mild to extremely spicy) and sliced cucumbers to cool the palate after the spicy salsas. Given that most customer ordered to go, parking wasn't an issue but it was certainly limited. Overall, I enjoyed the unique flavor of their meat and would certainly recommend if you are looking for a quick but flavorful meal."}
{"text":"Backyard Taco is one of those gems that locals swear by.  The unassuming A-frame building cannot properly portray the beautiful simplicity of mesquite grilled meats.  The tacos are fantastic, but the baked potato is where it's at for a hearty dinner.  The homemade flan is an excellent finish to a fast but delicious dinner."}
{"text":"Everything was really fresh and high quality. When we got there the line was out the door but we didn't have to wait long to get our food. The atmosphere makes you feel like you are sitting in a taco shop in Mexico."}
{"text":"SUCH AN AMAZING RESTAURANT! The food is spectacular and the management is on par with the food. The quesadillas and horchata are my favorite and make sure to load up on the salsas and sides at the salsa bar. I could drink the guacamole it's so good. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat!! Truly authentic Mexican food!  their family packs are the way to go! We feed a family of 7 for $30"}
{"text":"I was in the Mesa area and stumbled upon this place on Yelp with over 600 reviews. There was ample parking when we got there around 2 pm on a Saturday. There was a line but it moved fairly quick. Wow. The tacos here are amazing. I've been to Moreno's and other taco shops and this place wins hands down. Make sure you request grilled onions which is free. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Love this place! All the food is delicious and it is cheap. I have never left disappointed. The tacos remind me of something you would get in Rocky Point. I believe the tacos on Tuesday are cheaper then usual. Don't let that sway you in not going any other day. You wont regret coming here!"}
{"text":"HOW DOES A  MEXICAN FOOD PLACE NOT HAVE RICE?!? Two burritos, and one plain quesadilla was 28$! Freaking outrageous, food wasn't even great. Ridiculous, literally don't understand how this place doesn't have rice. It's mind boggling, truly. We ended up taking the quesadilla off to try and save money cause it seemed so expensive for so little. Ordered two carne asada burritos, with sour cream and cheese (which in my opinion should already come on the burritos but it DOES NOT), and with the quesadilla off it was still over 20$!!!!!!!!!!! OUTRAGEOUS."}
{"text":"$1.75 taco Tuesday. Went last night and it was incredible. Only bump in perfect was the soda was slightly flat. This is generally a sign that proper quality measures are not in place. Hence the low rank and the batch of negative reviews. This is hands down the best taco in the valley. The deal can't be beat. For that price they are large. Three tacos are plenty but if your a piggy like myself go for five.  A true feast. This location is tons better than the original Mesa location. I love the extra hot salsa it's similar to what I make at home. I love the guacamole salsa but it's mild. Tortilla are fresh. Taste like they make them there but I'm not sure if they do. I also really like their pico. Just wish the soda wasn't flat. Friendly staff too. They turn out a lot of orders quickly. The meat could be warmer in the taco. Also love the minced cabbage they put in the tacos. Great eats hope you go and have an experience as good as the one I had"}
{"text":"Believe the hype! This place was delicious, reasonably priced and very quick for lunch. Will definitely be back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"We Drive 120 miles to eat here! It is a wonderful place for the best Carne Asada around. Flavorful and fresh, and don't forget their salsas to top off your Burrito or Taco! I hope they keep it a small Family Business, and don't try and Commercialize it."}
{"text":"Was excited to try it out but ended up being underwhelmed. The steak tacos were dry and flavorless. I thing it had shredded cabbage on it...seriously? Also had the barrie (sp?)burrito. Shredded steak was plentiful but not much taste and seemed very salty.
For me it's one and done"}
{"text":"We were disappointed in Backyard Taco after seeing so many great reviews of the place. We went to dinner last night and my wife and I both had a 3-taco plate. She had one each of chicken/pollo, pork/birrea, and steak/carne asada. All three of mine were steak/carne asada. 

My wife's favorites were chicken/pollo and pork/birrea. She did not like the steak/carne asada, and neither did I. We both thought the meat was tough and of below average flavor. The salsas were good, but they don't make a meal. 

Staff were friendly, and our food came pretty fast. We sat at a pleasant outdoor table, and generally enjoyed the energy of the place, which was quite busy. 

But we most likely will not go back."}
{"text":"This place has a pretty cool set up and atmosphere. The cashier could have been a little friendlier when we explained this was our first time here for my husband and I and we were not sure about the menu. She was just sort of short with us, I did not get her name unfortunately. My husband ordered the carne asada burrito. His comments are the meat could be better seasoned. Not too much more, but maybe a little more rub or lime marinade, but not too much to spoil the flavor of the choice of salsa. I can agree, I had three tacos with carne asada and the meat could be flavored a bit more. I am not a fan of the flavor of avocado, but I can agree with some comments that it is too runny. Does not look appetizing at all. The other salsas were good. I liked the pico de gallo though it could use more lime and salt. My favorite was the red chunky salsa. I hope this helps in any changes needed to be made to make this place even better, as that's what reviews are for. To give suggestions on how to improve not just complain. Thanks for listening."}
{"text":"First place I have found that compares to Los Taquitos Carne asada.  Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Delicious oh so delicious! Very simple menu but I will say the food doesn't not have simple taste. I love this place!! The carne asada tacos and quesadillas were my favorite! I love the grilled taste of the moist meat! I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Great food and love the options. These tacos are great! Find it funny that some comment \"not authentic\" not sure what they are looking for. Son loves the asada quesadilla. Great salsa bar!The drive thru makes it super convenient. Definitely a go-to."}
{"text":"Amazing and fresh! The steak tacos are amazing! Also the burritos are delicious! Great food!"}
{"text":"My eyes are bigger than my stomach at Backyard Taco. No regrets! We've eaten here about 5 times now. The consistency, quality, and flavor keep bringing us back.  I probably shouldn't say this but Chipotle has nothin' on Backyard Taco (except more locations). We each get a carne asada burrito and two additional al pastor tacos. Why? Because we are fans of delicious flavor which makes us forget about the consequences of eating so much food! I could easily be content after half a burrito. The burrito is a masterpiece of flavor and texture. I have yet to find any place that compares. Please excuse me while head off to bed to dream of beautiful burritos."}
{"text":"Nope. Bland, tasteless food. We had three of us all with different orders and none of it was good. It's rare that we agree on food but we all agreed this was very sub-par mexican food. I would have gone 2 stars but on top of the food not being good they also messed up our take out order. Nothing more frustrating than driving 10 minutes home and finding the order wrong."}
{"text":"Not my favorite, won't go back. Ordered an everything burrito, it came with mostly meat. There was an accessory area, but I prefer not to open a burrito. They never go back together again!
Nice nice place, indoor/ outdoor seating, employees were nice."}
{"text":"Papa Loca is delicious.  It is chiminea foil shaped filled with surprises of goodness inside.  I wish I knew the person that made it so I can have them attend all my family BBQs."}
{"text":"Some of the best Tacos I have tried, I travel to Mexico often and know the difference from a real \"Taco\" and this guys had master the way to make Tacos al Carbon, which means on charcoal and the flavor is amazing, I go to their 2 Locations and I'm was happy to see a \"coming soon\" sign for their 3rd location!!"}
{"text":"Good tacos. Long wait. I can back a second time and they were much faster. Live the tacos!"}
{"text":"The tacos were freaking amazing! They aren't stingy with the chicken, which I appreciate. My chicken tacos were so fat! I love Mexico, I visit often for the street  tacos (and tequila). There was a guy sitting next to us with a Trump 2016 baseball cap. He ate like 6 tacos and made 2 trips to the salsa bar. Tacos = Unity. The world needs tacos. I would eat here everyday but my husband expects me to cook (yawn). Little does he know we're having this for dinner again, tomorrow!"}
{"text":"This place is beyond amazing, super friendly staff! The tacos are a must, don't get fooled by burritos or the crazy potato! For the love of all that is good get the TACOS! Danielle was super friendly and provided great customer service, she was awesome."}
{"text":"The el pastor potato was amazing. Never thought about potatoes and Mexican food together but omg it was good. They put a chopped up baked potato in a foil wrap then topped it with a ton of cheese and followed it up wi el pastor cilantro and onions. It was definitely worth coming back for"}
{"text":"I found this place to be pretty tasty.  Also reasonably priced.  I really liked their crazy potato. Think baked potato without the skin shoved into a tin foil pouch with meat, cheese, & garnish.  Also Taco Bell has ruined my ideas of what a gordita is. Backyard's is like a tostada with meat, cheese, & garnish on a thicker piece of tortilla. Its also very tasty. And finally we talk about the tacos. They are street tacos so they are smaller. But the flavors are really good. In all,  if you're looking for something that does not have burritos,  you've come to the right place. It has a salsa bar. Chips cost $2. But like an earlier yelper said, a good amount of food for around $10.00. \"We fight for tacos\""}
{"text":"We had high hopes going in to this new restaurant ( based on the good yelp reviews) . The chips were tasty(not stale) other than that, the food was just BLEH. I will say the place was hopping and the line was out the door, which would make one believe the food is phenomenal.  Sadly, not the case. My kids basically had chips and sub par beans for dinner. The vampiro shell was almost impossible to bite into, so I had to scrape all the meat off to eat it. My daughter had to scrape the beans and cheese off hers too. My son ordered a papa loco and after one bite turned it away. I don't know what it was about the food. satisfying or flavorful.  My husband loaded his tacos with salsa and made the comment that \"tacos should stand on their own\". The salsas weren't even that tasty.  I guess one draw could be the price. It is very inexpensive, but in this case, you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Used to love this place for taco Tuesday and for late night eats but more and more it's becoming disappointing. Prices are going up and portions have decreased by half or more. If it's not a Tuesday it's not worth it. Pastor used to be amazing but today it was dry and tasteless and no piña."}
{"text":"Found this gem while driving around for work. I have made plenty of trips here and the only downside is they don't have a drive thru. Their tacos, beans, carne asada baked potatoes are delicious. Lunch time is always super busy with the line out he door."}
{"text":"This is our absolute favorite place to visit. The food is always on point. They are a new location with new employees still learning the systems and procedures so I can't hold that against them. Food is good. Restaurant is clean. Customer service is fairly decent for a brand new location with still a few bugs to kink out. We are repeat customers as often as we can. We recommend this to everyone we meet!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing.   Brand new location is beautiful.  If you want something quick, I'd wait a few weeks.  Although I understand that it's a new restaurant, 8 tacos took 34 min from when my receipt was handed to me until we got our food.   Will for sure come back and hopefully they have more than two registers running, one of which is also answering phones."}
{"text":"It was ok, but I wouldn't go back. 
Just not special or noteworthy.

Also, they got the wrong shells for my tacos and when I asked if it was ok to have them remade they acted like it was my fault for not being clearer. I pointed it out on my receipt and apologized even though I don't know what I could have done differently."}
{"text":"Most authentic Mexican food in Mesa! I always get their Carne Asada quesadilla and am pleased every time. I have brought many friends and they have all been impressed. The unlimited salsa bar is a nice touch - I love their pico and guacamole sauce. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I have to say Costco chips at a Mexican food place is a joke. The salsa bar ok, but nothing mild to eat. Expensive place for Mexican food.
Steak was a cheap chewy meat. Much better food choices out there."}
{"text":"Really delicious carne asada tacos. They cook the meat over charcoal.They have a really good selection of salsas too.Fast service."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant. This place gets busy but they keep the line moving quickly. Everything on the menu is excellent but my kids love the stuffed quesadillas the most. And the salsa bar is on point. We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"This place is bomb dot com! Probably the best cheap Mexican food in the east valley. I recommend the Crazy Potato, or the best bean and cheese burrito I've had in a very long time.
Backyard Taco even has a salsa bar... If you're into that."}
{"text":"pretty good! I have always been a huge fan of tacos! the taste is good and not too greasy. I love the variety of sauces and the option to get half corn and half flour tortillas! small menu and simple (:  very clean and A+ customer service."}
{"text":"It's more like a 4.5 but since it was so great I rounded up rather than down.  

That said, the entire experience was wonderful.  A friend of mine suggested that we give it a go for dinner because it was Taco Tuesday.  The tacos are $1.25 from early afternoon until 10pm every Tuesday.  They were fresh, fast, and delicious.  The restaurant itself is located in a less-than-pristine part of downtown Mesa but you would never guess it.  From the bright, modern look of the outside to the absurd cleanliness of the inside (INCLUDING the bathrooms which tells you a lot about any restaurant), aesthetically it is appealing and seems out of place compared to some of the neighborhood that surrounds it.  

When you walk up you are greeted by a cozy patio with lush plants and white, twinkly lights.  Upon entering, it's colorful, lively but not rowdy, and the kitchen is the first point of reference.  Immediately you'll notice an iron grill with food roasting on it.  You can watch your food being prepared and handled with care.

The food and drink (in my case, Horchata) were phenomenal.  I got all three types of tacos (carnitas, chicken, and pulled beef).  There is a salsa bar with pickled onions, guac, cucumbers, citrus, radishes, a JALAPENO SALSA, pico de gallo and two types of salsa.  It's included as part of the experience; they aren't trying to nickle and dime you.  

All of this positive feedback in mind, it was the moment I received my food that the place went from a 5 to a 4... I know street tacos are small but I felt that these were a tad too small.  Regularly priced I would have spent $6 and had it not been for the complimentary salsa bar (I took full advantage of the cucumbers with pico de gallo which took them from a 4 to a 4.5) I would have left hungry.  On days other than Tuesday, I feel like they might want to offer a 3 for $5 deal.  That extra dollar to put towards a 4th taco would make all the difference in my simple, frugal peace of mind.  Luckily, Tuesday comes every week so if I'm being super cheap, that'll be the day I go.

All-in-all it was a near perfect taco experience.  Thanks for choosing Mesa to plant this little gem.  I will be returning often and recommending it to friends!"}
{"text":"Returned for more tasty tacos but was blown away by the service. Food was ready within 15 minutes during the busy lunch hour rush and the staff was helpful, courteous and treated me like a human. Well done backyard taco!"}
{"text":"Have been back a few times to Backyard and they have stepped it up. The family pack taco combo is straight bomb. Spoke with the owner Ruben and told him I wrote the first review and would update it with a new recommendation. You gotta try this and I'm telling you order the family pack as an individual if you are a big eater.....it is worth it! Tell them half carne asada and half pollo asado."}
{"text":"By far the best tacos in town!!! I have never had anything more authentic in Arizona! Service is great, food is great, Backyard Taco is the greatest thing to happen!!!"}
{"text":"Honestly, wanted to love it!  So many neighbors raved about it coming, so we were excited, It's in my backyard.  We have gone twice, and both times it was ok to bad.  Chips are STALE.  Pork, cheese quesadilla was ok, some gristle, very greasy.  Bean cheese burrito? How can you ruin that you ask?  Well at Backyard taco, the beans are Soupy texture, impossible to eat, unless with a spoon, and NO cheese. 
Taste of beans was super BLAND. NEVER again.  Drive up service is a little slow. Only positive is the staff is super friendly."}
{"text":"The food was pretty delicious, but pricey. When you buy little tiny tacos, you don't expect to spend so much."}
{"text":"They have great food, don't get me wrong, but the portion sizes seemed small when I went, but it's about quality, not quantity, right?"}
{"text":"Ordered 2pollo tacos. They were good not outstanding. The size was on the small side. The condiment bar was excellent. Worst part was the 2.50 for chips and salsa. Chips looked and tasted like from store. 2.50 for mediocre chips. Probably won't return"}
{"text":"Was not impressed. Ordered 3 tacos .ice cold place was packed .waited in line .cold not very happy"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I wanted this place to be great!!! Food wasn't bad buttttttttt don't be in any rush to place your order. Saturday @ 5 and they have one person taking orders, until the phone rings. She then stops taking orders and answers the phone. Line out the door and still no one taking orders in person. Poorly managed and that'll be the downfall of this location. I never complain about a wait, but there was far too many people doing nothing to have this poor girl trying to take in house orders and phone orders. Just go to Mucha Lucha and you'll have a better taco experience"}
{"text":"So far SO good. Love the price, but more importantly, the tacos do not disappoint. I got all three tacos- chicken, shredded beef and Carne asada. Our favorite was the shredded beef. Bonus: salsa bar! Beware the green salsa, it's HOT! I'm a serious salsa guzzler and even that was off the heat scale for me... it didn't stop me from eating it though. Can't wait to try the other items on the menu, especially the crazy potatoes."}
{"text":"Backyard Taco has delicious food and its very cheap! It is a small place, quite little seating inside and out, but it did not bother me. It is well organized, clean, and the inside is up to date. When I went there for the first time, it was very busy, so if you go here you must go here early."}
{"text":"Stopped in for Taco Tuesday last week. Great tacos, good service, and the smell of the wood pit put a nice nit of mesquite smoke in the air. A fire engine showed up and the crew came in for food. No better endorsement then that! Trust me I know!"}
{"text":"YUM! Tastes fresh and delicious. Nice atmosphere, lifts you up. The place is always packed. They should definitely open another location. The horchata is some of the best I've had and all the food is great"}
{"text":"Best authentic Mexican tacos around! We first tried it when it was literally in a backyard and have never stopped coming!  Fresh salsa bar to top your tacos off with! Meat is always fresh and top quality!"}
{"text":"My first visit to Backyard Taco and I will definitely be coming back soon! Reminds me so much of the great street tacos we enjoyed in Rocky Point! A delicious salsa bar with everything you need to make the carne asada and chicken tacos taste amazing. Taco Tuesday price was a bonus for our first visit."}
{"text":"Alright, so as a Latino, I love business stories of Latinos that make the most of what this nation has to offer. The great food and establishment of Backyard Taco is exactly that! Not only that, they have great service!! My man, Edwin totally served my girlfriends family and I super well. If you haven't come by, you need to"}
{"text":"Delicious carne asada and nice mesquite flavor. We visit when we are in this part of town."}
{"text":"This place is seriously the best taco place ever. Everything about it is fantastic. The owner and the people working here are all great. The best tacos I've ever had in my life and even homemade lemonade!"}
{"text":"Great Place!!! Go there often. They always treat my family great food is priced great - they are always helping out local schools - Cant wait to go there this week"}
{"text":"We went for taco tuesday. It was good but the tacos were a little small. The salsa bar was good."}
{"text":"So I heard the hype about this place... that when it first started (hence the name) that it was literally a back yard operation that got so good that the neighbors made it move out. I heard that when it opened there was a line out the door. Etc.

To make it short... I have absolutely no idea what the hype is or if I got some bad hype info. A quick review would be - no character and no flavor.

Between the wife and I we ordered four things off the menu. We weren't impressed with any of it.

No flavor (maybe some, but I've had better at home out of a packet) - this goes for the meats especially. The most flavor I got was from the potatoes oddly enough. I'm not going to count the sauces as that isn't what you're paying for. I honestly think that I can make better food and I'm far, far removed from culinary excellency.

The service sucked. We had never been here and the gal at the counter seemed totally annoyed at our questions. And when it was time to sign she wanted us to sign with no pen. We asked for one and she didn't hear us. When she realized we didn't sign she again seemed annoyed. Point is she was too busy talking to other people and/or daydreaming. Soda was flat - I told them and they kind of looked at me like they didn't understand.

Speed of service. The food came out in like 1 minute. So that is good, but I think it kind of speaks to the bland taste as it is all mass prepared and just tossed out the window with no regard to flavoring. The main concern is - is it hot? If the answer is yes, then give it to the customer.

I'd like to think that it was an off night but I have the strong feeling it was not. I'd like to give it a second chance but I don't think it is worth the drive nor the price to give it another go.

I sure hope that whatever backyard operation gave birth to this had more concern to the quality of food than what I experienced tonight."}
{"text":"Really good tacos. The only complaint is a little dry. The salsa helped a little bit. The place was busy and staff friendly. I would go back but wouldn't go out of my way. I gave them 3 jalapeños..."}
{"text":"Went there last Saturday and it was pretty busy.  Difficult to park as there is only a handful of spaces in their lot.  I had to park in the lot west of the place, across the street.  The restaurant was clean and seemed well managed.  The carne asada was ok.  I think my expectations were too high.  The meat tasted a little burnt.  It was still good, just not as good as the other reviews make it sound.  I thought the chicken was much better.  Also, the chips and salsa were delicious.  I'll definitely be back because overall the experience was good."}
{"text":"Decent salsa. Weird guacamole. Good tortillas. Great carne asada. Flowery horchata. No shrimp or fish tacos. Overpriced Mexican sodas. Good beans. Decent chips. No pork. Three stars. 

Fix the guacamole. Consider adding fish/shrimp. Price the Mexican sodas at more like 99 cents. Definitely get some carnitas on that menu. Then you get 5 stars."}
{"text":"I truley wanted to give this AMAZING tasting taco joint 5 stars, until....
I went back to order another few tacos, so my significant other handed me a $50 dollar bill, which I barley glanced at because it was part of our money we traded earlier.. The older lady at the cash register saw this apparently because when i ordered my second round of tacos and paid for it, she handed me back cash as if it was a $20 bill that I handed her.  It took several second to sort it out until she handed me back the right amount of change.
...just saying... she was very apologetic.  YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE"}
{"text":"Not a lot of Choice. The menu looks like a watered down version of a real taco shop. They only have 3 kinds of meats. Chicken, steak and carnitas. Needs more variety. Got there and left as soon as i saw the menu. But maybe that doesnt mean their food is good. So try it out. But dont expect much. Since its a very simple with their small menu."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesdays are best spent at Backyard Taco. The carne asada steak tacos had an excellent smokey flavor with fresh pico de gallo to boot. Friendly employees and a great atmosphere that complements the food. My friends and I will be back soon for more."}
{"text":"the burritos i got were really big and the meat was well cooked,great sauce station they had in the corner. fast service,a clean facility and hardworking employees"}
{"text":"If you are a fan of any Mexican style mesquite grilled meats, do NOT miss this place. My husband and I had a quick lunch here and were stunned at how flavorful and rich the simple food we ordered was. He had a chicken burro and I had the chicken quesadilla and chicken taco. Can hardly remember any Mexican grilled food tasting so great. My only criticism is that the informal, bright, colorful atmosphere would indicate that the staff would also be welcoming and fun. Not so. No Mexican hospitality at all. They were uniformly dour, unfriendly and mechanical. When I asked for our table to be wiped down, the cashier barely acknowledged me and then we ended up having to wipe it down ourselves. Staff needs to be friendly and welcoming, with a smile for all, and this place would get 5 stars from me."}
{"text":"I decided to check this place out late one night to get some tacos.. Every now and then a brother just has to has some carne asada tacos and beans.."}
{"text":"Delicious Mexican food in my neighborhood!! I had the chicken burrito which was huge and full of deliciousness. The restaurant has an outdoor patio and some nice seating inside. Very clean and the staff was friendly. Love!!"}
{"text":"Loved this place!  Went in due to the curb appeal and saw the drive thru with a huge line for dinner. It was a busy atmosphere with families and felt hip. The menu was also simple but you had many choices of building you own salsa with your choice of tacos, quesadillas, torts etc. service was extremely quick and loved the glass bottle drinks. Did not use the patio but was there to use. Little hot these days to go out. Will be back more often for quick meals."}
{"text":"This place is fire! Great amount of meat, friendly staff and better atmosphere! I would get the tacos and burrito again, wasn't a fan of the quesadilla, but it was still good! The chicken is hella yummy!!  I would come again but on a weekend and dine it."}
{"text":"The food was very good and the prices were great. I have tried their burritos/tacos and I have not been disappointed yet."}
{"text":"Backyard Taco is probably the best place to get authentic tacos in Mesa. The carne asada taco is the best. My husband always orders their burritos and he loves them. This place is always busy but their service is fast and friendly. No complaints."}
{"text":"A fantastic taco place in the heart of Mesa. Highly recommended for anyone who loves a traditional street taco. 

My absolute favorite is the chicken taco with the birria following second and carne asada taco last. Truthfully the carne asada was not my favorite, but the others made up for it. 

They offer a variety of delicious menu options, their crazy potatoes/ papa loca are to die for and their gorditas are fantastic as well. The burrito is liked by others but I was not the biggest fan.

Seating can be an issue on busy nights with limited indoor seating and an outdoor patio with heaters."}
{"text":"So good!!!  We tried all the tacos, the papas loco, beans and salsas. Everything was very good, we will def be going back.  The service was also great!!"}
{"text":"Sometimes a good place depends on when you go if its busy you wait in a very long line and the food sometimes comes out dry...Great prices but hit or miss but if u go, go on Tuesday..."}
{"text":"This is in my neighborhood and love the food.  It has a great salsa bar and the tacos are amazing!  I often wish the restaurant was bigger they are always crowded because the food is so amazing."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service! The grilled onions were to die for! Very clean! Amazing food! Great first impression! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I had better tacos from the street vendors in Hermosillo. I expected these to be just as good but sadly no luck. I have stopped in twice. As tacos go they are okay but nothing spectacular. I stopped during the lunch then decided to try again before the lunch rush to see if there was a difference. Meat was dry and flavorless both times."}
{"text":"Now don't get me wrong, The place is clean, gorgeous, the staff friendly, the service prompt. The prices, reasonable.

I just wasn't blown away by their food. I feel like it is something that I could've whipped up in my own kitchen fairly easily with a similar taste. If this was at a food festival, or a pop up stands, I could understand a little more...but for a stationery building...

Definitely, give it a try if it peaks your interest. But It simply didn't have that extra oomph that I was expecting. I'd just go to chipotle."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! We go here so much and it always is amazing. Beware of the orange hot sauce, though, it's super spicy ;)"}
{"text":"Real carne asada cooked on a mesquite fired Santa Maria grill. If you haven't eaten here, you're really missing out!"}
{"text":"We love this place. We've done the family packs a few times and everything is always ready to go and awesome when we requested it. We live close and we enjoy it frequently. I would highly recommend the family packs for large family gatherings. They included all of the toppings for the tacos and salsa too. The employees are also awesome and always super kind to us."}
{"text":"I love their tacos! Holy moly do yourself a favor and get the carne asada it's heaven on earth. Plus, the salsa that comes with the chips is to die. I can't say enough good things about the food. Sometimes service is lacking but the food is well worth it."}
{"text":"Whoa, just had this place for the 3rd time...  Hard to beat the flavor of their carne asada - not sure if it's their marinade or the fact that's it's grilled, but it's unbelievable.  Everything I've had here is good.  My only constructive feedback is the salsa is kind of weak, but that's not keeping me from coming back.  Highly recommend..."}
{"text":"Love the ambiance! Cool lighting, very clean, friendly service. Great drink selection (fountain and bottled)! Food's not bad either! Great service from Edith. Highly recommend, but not good that it's right next to my gym"}
{"text":"Never go to backyard toco! Overpriced ,overrated said it would be half an hour turned out to be one hour ,tiny portions, stale ,not good!"}
{"text":"Hey! This place is the BEST!!!! Legit the best and I'm no stranger to Mexican Food. 

ALWAYS packed. Not good if you have social anxiety. Small place and wish they would get a better layout for their sauces. 

These guys need a bigger building. I still think it would be full."}
{"text":"Lots of people seem to like this place. Its very reasonable in price but there's not much to the  food either, kind of tasteless and small portions. Mostly hipsters seem to go here, crappy seating outside with the most uncomfortable plastic chairs facing a noisy busy road."}
{"text":"Went here because it's close to my house and has great reviews. I probably won't be back much, definitely not for the price. It's really nothing special, bland and not a lot for what you pay, especially for a taco/Mexican place. They have a good salsa bar, that's probably the only reason I'm giving them 3 stars. It's always really busy, with no parking unless you want to park on the street which basically cuts off the road for people trying to get by on Hunt, probably not safest for you or your car. I guess it's ok if you're looking for some artificial 'ethnic experience'. My mother in law is from Chihuahua and a terrible cook, but I'd rather go to her house to eat than this place. IMO"}
{"text":"THE best authentic tacos and burritos in Mesa. The potatoe thing is mind blowing too!"}
{"text":"There is nothing like Backyard Taco. They have the best grilled food and the service is always great!"}
{"text":"I really had high hopes for this place because I've heard so many good things about Backyard Taco. I only put two stars because of the atmosphere. Unfortunately, it was not a thumps up for me. I myself am Mexican-American, and this was not authentic Mexican food for me. The salsa's are very bland, and very watery, as if the salsa's came from cans. The \"Guacamole\" has a water consistency, no texture to it. I ordered a quesadilla and it was really cold, and the cheese was cold. I do not consider this place authentic Mexican food. This place is very overpriced as well."}
{"text":"This place is the best holy crap!!!@-@ kindve packed though. But who cares!!! Greatest tacos. I have ever tasted and so juicy. The steak is my all time favorite here. You won't be disappointed at all. New spot for taco Tuesday. :3"}
{"text":"(Drive Thru)They were so incredibly unprofessional and rude especially today. and they NEVER ask you if you want salsa/sauce ( I mean come on, even Taco Bell asks if you want salsa). They just  they never smile. I even tried to joke to get a crack and I got nothing. horrible for being so new to neighborhood. Their food is on point so their customer service needs to step it up or they are going to loose a lot of customers! Come on management!!!"}
{"text":"I've had my fair share of Mexican food. This was your run of the mill kind of place.  I asked for a steak bowl, that wasn't on the menu. The very nice young man said they done have bowls. We had a language barrier and that proved to be the problem. I asked another man who appeared to be possibly a manager and explain to him I was diabetic and prefer to have my steak burrito in a bowl. He said yes we can do that.  The bowl was a medium sized foam cup. The steak was small pieces, I thought it was eating hamburger and not steak. The parking lot is extremely small for the center and if you're going from the south to the north you have to make a U-turn to get in the parking lot. Another fine design approved by the Town of Gilbert. Overall the meals OK. I'm sure I'll go again at least one more time."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! I love these tacos! With great prices!!! They reminded me of the tacos I had when I was in San Fran. Those tacos made me cry, literally no joke. These tacos came close to giving me that wondrous experience."}
{"text":"Best taco north of the Mexican border!  Can't say enough good things about this place."}
{"text":"This is on my list of places to take people when they visit Arizona. It's super casual with amazing food! Parking can get a bit scary since the place is always packed and is right on the main road but totally worth it."}
{"text":"Great taco place. Definitely improving since opening a few months ago. However,  I used to go to their first location in Mesa on University.  For some reason the food at that one taste so much better!  Now they just need to start serving beer."}
{"text":"Absolutely can't wait Til Tuesday comes around.  I love the papa loco , beans , tacos and salsa bar is super!!"}
{"text":"I almost hate to let the secret out of the bag. Bar none this place turns out the best tacos I have ever had. I knew there had to be something about this place when I saw the car lined up around the building. The line inside was equally as long, but the 20 min. wait was so worth it. It's quite large on the inside and there's also out door donn g as well. You can watch the guys are grilling right out in the open and your mouth really starts to water when you start taking on the smells. It's a no frills place, so come as you are, you will not be disappointed. Bar none the best tacos I've ever had."}
{"text":"The tacos are without a doubt the best. The service isn't as consistent. It just seems that they have a new girl in \"training\" taking my order every time. 
This place is a real gem though. It gets packed around lunch so come early."}
{"text":"we love this place!  always fresh, always friendly and always Very good!  its always extremely busy so that must tell you they are doing something right.  i highly recommend this for tacos in the East Valley"}
{"text":"The food was definitely worth five stars. The carne asada was deeeeelicious!  The only complaint I had was the lack of seating. We had to eat outside, and outside in AZ in August is no bueno."}
{"text":"It use to be in someone's backyard and was much better. I need to try it again to verify but I think tacos mich are much better. Just my personal experience."}
{"text":"I like the food here, but almost 50% my orders come out wrong. And we're not talking about anything difficult here. When I ask for a chicken burrito, I don't really mean I want a beef burrito. Or when I've ordered a cheese quesadilla for my kid and I get two chicken tacos, I just wonder how this stuff happens. Is it just carelessness? I mean the receipt even said cheese quesadilla. Whatever it is, it makes me second guess whether I want go here if I don't have time to open up everything and make sure I got the right things."}
{"text":"The food is great here, but please expect a wait, especially depending on what you order. The longest I've waited so far was 25 mins.  I've been so far 2 times in one week. My 10 yr old daughter fell in love with their steak quesadillas an I fell in love with their loaded steak baked potato, delicious! I would highly recommend this restaurant, but please excersize patience because you will wait about 15 mins at best."}
{"text":"Favorite taco shop in Mesa! I only wish they had a drive-thru so I could treat myself when my kids fall asleep in the car!"}
{"text":"Tacos In The Back, Waste Of Money In The Front!  Driving by this place the first couple weeks it was open, I just knew I had to take some time and check it out.  Unfortunately, as \"cute\" as this hole-in-the-neighborhood venue is, the food was very disappointing on both occasions I went there!  The motto is:  Pick a meat and pick your price tag.  $9 gets you 2 fairy-size tacos, a soggy tostada and a small drink...enough disappointment for 1 person.  Disappointing 2 people could set you back $20-$30 quickly.  The tacos are tiny and the meat is bland.  I tried both the beef and the chicken during my visits there.  The beef had almost no taste and the chicken was so dry my last time there, I could barely swallow it, even with the low-quality liquid additions from the \"salsa\" bar!    When I took my fiance, she wouldn't even finish the meal, she was so disappointed!  The ingredients in each of the menu items are exactly the same...meat and tortilla.  The taco is a spoonful of meat on a tiny tortilla.  A tostada is a small mound of meat on a larger tortilla.  A quesadilla is a small scoop  of meat with a little cheese added...in a tortilla.  They would do better to simply offer \"tacos\" only and reduce the price.  All the menu items taste the same and the only real difference between each one is the increasing price tag.  I highly recommend you avoid Backyard Taco if you have tastebuds and/or financial sense!"}
{"text":"Never have a bad meal here. The meat is phenomenal and the salsa bar is tasty when it is stocked. They get so busy at times it runs low. The only area I could say may need improvement is the onion and lettuce toppings being more fresh or just more options. Either way the meat is great and I will continue to come here."}
{"text":"Been here a bunch of times, but never reviewed it. Best tacos around period. I haven't tried anything else. Why?"}
{"text":"I'd give this place a 4 star or better but the service brought down my rating. Service should be more professional and at least pretend that you enjoy your job. My fiancé and I wanted to order desert but we didn't want to talk to the person taking our order again. Food was great. Price was okay. Service was not that great. Hope you can fix that soon because I'm willing to come back and see if there is improvement. Good luck."}
{"text":"Oh hell yeah. Al carbon tacos are off the charts. Crazy potato might be the best thing for a hangover next to an IV of saline and a Bloody Mary ... every reason to make it out this far to Mesa."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that the service here was relatively quick and friendly.  Went through the drive through and ordered a chicken quesadilla, two chicken tacos, and a chicken burrito.  The chicken was extremely dry and overcooked. The quesadilla had a very small amount of cheese making it less of a quesadilla and more of an oversized taco with unappetizing meat.  I will not be going back here again."}
{"text":"The service here is alway excellent! Today Edwin took good care of my order. I had a bit of a complicated order with 3 carne Assad's burritos. I had a substitution with grilled onions instead of raw onions and other stuff. All tasted excellent as usual. Thanks Edwin!"}
{"text":"My son and I were on our way to live music and decided to stop in at Backyard Taco.  We each and 2 chicken and 2 steak tacos.  Everything about the tacos was perfect even though the place was packed.  It was obvious that the kitchen team takes great pride in their work.  The only thing they could do better is to figure out a way to make the salsa bar more efficient.  Perhaps pre-dispense some salsa containers for dine-in customers?"}
{"text":"Great tacos and the crazy potato worth the hype. Not that many places can Americanize good Mexican food but these guys have executed it well. I highly suggest for you to stop by and support this local business. #Provecho"}
{"text":"The carne asada was pretty good, but we thought the chicken was mediocre.  Nice homemade tortillas."}
{"text":"I've tried this location three times now so I believe I can give an accurate assessment. If it's too crowded, there is a good chance you will not be happy with the service or cleanliness. If it's not crowded, both the friendliness and accuracy of your order improve and there is a clean table available to use. 

The food is good.  The meat is bland if you choose a beef taco, but flavorful if you choose a quesadilla with pork. So if you choose well, you will get a good meal.  The salsas all help bam up the flavor too and I suggest making a trip to the salsa bar before eating your food.

There is a need for consistency at this location.  Many people visit once,compare it to the established one in Mesa and then do not return.  My last visit was my best visit, so I suggest giving them another try if you went a while ago."}
{"text":"I love this place. Feels like a restaurant you'd find in Venice Beach CA. With fast friendly service, great food & character. I love it & can't say enough good things about it. We need more places like this in our area."}
{"text":"My husband said it was good but could be better. The beans were good but seemed like they were missing salt and pepper which is fine because you can add it. The tacos were good, but the chicken was dry and bland. The veg crazy potato was amazing! I was scraping at the sides of the foil trying to get every last morsel because I loved it! I also tried the shredded steak gordita which was pretty good too.

Overall, pretty good. Hit or miss on some things but priced reasonably!"}
{"text":"I love eating here back from the begining! The best Tacos in town! Wouldn't choose anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Finally got to see what all the hype was about.  Backyard Taco is one of those places people mention in conversation the same way they would mention \"Bono\" or \"Elvis\" - no further explanation necessary.  I will preface this review by saying I was very hungry when I arrived, so my review may be a little generous.  But I still stand by it.  I got the chicken tacos and they were tasty.  I was happily surprised that prices were really reasonable as well.  Service was quick, although the guy taking orders didn't look like he really wanted to be there.  But, whatever, you don't have to be chipper to sell me a taco.  The most surprising part of my meal was the fresh-tasting lemonade.  Bottom line: good food at good prices.  I've heard there can be long wait times when they're busy, so would I wait half an hour or more in line to order my food? No, it's not that life-changing.  Would I go there again and wait a few minutes in line? Absolutely."}
{"text":"Great food. Authentic Mexican!  Quaint little indoor/outdoor eating area. 

Best service we have had at a restaurant in a long time. All the staff were pleasant and went out of their way, even as the restaurant was closing."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Best food ever
 Be prepared to wait in a line. Salsa bar is amazing too. Definitely a must try place"}
{"text":"Needs more destinctive seasoning but an okay taco or anything else on the menu that tickles the Texican Mexican tsstebuds."}
{"text":"Went with a group and we all loved it! Great prices, delicious carne Asada and of my goodness the pico, sooooo yummy! We were literally getting plates of the pico to dip chips in and slather our tacos with!"}
{"text":"Pretty good but a little pricey for a taco. Carne Asada was dry, and the assembly line delivery of the food is very non caring should one have an issue.  For a quick street style taco without the expectation that the meat will be malleable ( expect overcooked, dried out Carne) or if you want a more digestible meat(chicken is flavorful) then \"it's all good\".  Not many things are perfect and delivering consistently very good  food to the masses has got to be a very, very difficult and almost impossible hurdle to clear."}
{"text":"Expected so much more, after reading other reviews.  Just okay, though I will admit the side were pretty good."}
{"text":"Loved this place and thought the drive-thru was convenient until maybe after the last two times I visited. First time I waited about 6 minutes for someone to take my order. This time I waited 10. What's shitty about it all was that there was no one ahead of me. I called out \"hello\" a few times and nothing. Get rid of the drive thru if it takes you more than 4 minutes for someone to get help. Today was my last visit to this place. Y'all are better off going to chipotle. So sad."}
{"text":"This place has very good tacos and pretty good service I've been their many times and every time I went I tried something and it was great! There meat is very seasoned and delicious."}
{"text":"Food was incredible! Great price for the quality. Al pastor taco, carne asada vampiro, and birria gordita were amazing!!"}
{"text":"Tacos were really good. They're kind of expensive though. I had to get 6 to just fill me up at $2.25. I'm interested to try their other options on the menu. (If I can come by at a time where the line isn't out the door.) Also not very many parking spots, or tables to eat. All and all they were good!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to have something new and different so close to our house, but the service is terrible. Employees have no sense of urgency, no manager around  and all the ladies in the back were just hanging around talking. I tried to call 3 times and nobody answered so I decided to walk in to order. The phone should have been my first hint to forget it. 10 minutes waiting to order, 20 minutes waiting for food, not terrible, but still, how does is take that long to make what they serve?! Also, the last thing in the world this place needs is a drive thru, they can't manage the foot traffic and the drive thru is going to be a disaster. They need some serious training and management otherwise they're not gonna last. Oh! I almost forgot about the food! That should tell you something. Steak on the quesadilla tasted  like a burned hamburger, beans were ok. The menu has little explanation and the employees are certainly not able to help."}
{"text":"This backyard taco is great. It's a go to for friends that are visiting. I only order the tacos and love the whole spectrum offered. They recently offer al pastor tacos which are now my wife's favorite. My personal favorite are the chicken tacos. It's a great atmosphere. There is always a line which is a good sign to me and is only about 5 min or less. The salsa bar is great and the company is awesome!"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place as a suggestion from a coworker. We were pleasantly surprised at the quality of food and the amount of food for the price. We split a burrito and some tacos along with their chips and salsa. The food was very authentic and we will be back."}
{"text":"I was misguided by the yelp rating... There is nothing special about this place. The food was alright, but nothing makes this place stand out. The chips were also stale."}
{"text":"We love Backyard Taco! Service is fast and friendly and their tacos are the best! So excited they opened this second location close to where I work! If you haven't tried it yet, what are you waiting for? Go today!"}
{"text":"I hear a lot of great things about Backyard Taco so I had to try it out for myself. 

It's a busy taco shop with both indoor and outdoor seating - so don't be surprised when there are flies flying around your table inside as well. You can see them cooking your food and grilling your meats behind the counter. There's also a self serve salsa bar to the right of the line. 

What I really came for was the Crazy Potato al pastor. I tried some when my brother brought one home the other week and it was delicious! Spoon full of meat, potato, and cilantro. Well, when I had it for myself, I quickly found that the cup didn't give me the portions I was looking for. It came with plenty of potato and cilantro but not enough meat to last evenly. Good idea though! Loaded potato in other words. 

We also ordered one of each taco. In my opinion, I've had better carne. However I am a fan of their pastor. 

Tip: check into Yelp for a free side of chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Authentic, delicious food that keeps me coming back for more! I had driven by a few times and the place is always busy, finally pulled it up on yelp to see what the buzz was about. Simple menu, salsa bar, bottled soda good friendly service, what more could a taco stand offer? Backyard Tacos offers that and more, chicken and beef street tacos in your preference of corn or flour tortillas, quesadillas, tostadas, burritos, gorditas and tortas, chips and salsa galore! The meat is tender, flavored well and grilled to perfection! The burritos are huge and packed with flavor. Their salsa bar is always fresh and loaded with Pico, salsa Verde, chipotle/fire roasted sauce, cucumbers, and guacamole. Even the sour cream is eye rolling amazing! We have gone several times, never once been disappointed! Fantastic food and friendly service, we love BYT!

BYT offers a Repeat Eater card 10 stamps=free meal!
Check in on Yelp for their bag of free chips and salsa!"}
{"text":"The people giving this place bad reviews don't understand street tacos.

I have visited multiple times and the food is great! Tacos are small, but at $2.25, they're fairly priced.  The burritos, salsas, quesadillas, and chimis are excellent as well.

This will be a go to taco spot for me.  It tastes as authentic as any of these hole in the wall joints around town and costs less, for a better product.

Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Loved the Carne Asada Gordita-my son ate the burrito and really liked it too.  Order came out quick and fresh-great selection on the salsa bar.  Also, plenty of choices of sodas-will come back again!"}
{"text":"Tacos made the way gma did.  They even have baked potatoes (these are made the way gpa made 'em).  Plus they have a salsa bar."}
{"text":"Again the best Tacos in Mesa!!! The carne asada is great!!! Chicken good flan great!!!"}
{"text":"Some people will ask me why the rating of 1. Isn't this the best tasting taco in the valley? 
Well hands down this comes very close to the best Carne asada I have had north of the border.  I have been a regular to this place for the  last 5 years...and believe me or not...once in every 3-4 visits I get sick from the beef. And it's not just me...my other friends share the same view. 
So I hope someone reads this and addresses the food handling issue. This place deserves a 5. 
U must have guessed...even with bad stomach result..I still am a regular...that should tell you about the place!!"}
{"text":"I've come here numerous times and although the food is really good, the employees lack customer service skills.  They have forgotten my order on several occasions and always forget my drink so I have to wait until someone comes over to pour it.
The chicken is wonderful and very tasty, I love the chicken tacos and burritos, although I do occasionally find bones in the meat.  The carne asada is good as well and sometimes it is overcooked but I still like it.  
During the lunch and dinner hours it is extremely busy and with the place being very small, it's tough to fins a place to sit down sometimes.  The best thing about this place is the prices, they are very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"This was a decent, fun trendy place to stop in right quick for a refreshing Taco in Tempe woth friends.  Food quality isn't too bad.
No beer though*"}
{"text":"We've kind of fallen in love with this place. The Carne Asada is to die for. Street tacos and Burritos with guacamole. Yum!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a Taco Tuesday backyard regular. But I think I'm done! Seriously over an hour for two tacos??? Time to hire some staff."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the fuss is over. This place is just okay. Wayyy over rated in my opion. My wife makes better Mexican food...There way more white people there than mexicans. That should tell you all you need to  know and I'm white. We think we know good Mexican food but, really we dont."}
{"text":"I live right down the street and I love driving by at night because it's just a very cute little restaurant. They have white lights strung on the patio area and that grotto type texture wins my heart every time. At the end of the day, it's a taco stand, and there's no inside seating, but the cuteness isn't the only thing that sets it apart from other taco stands in Mesa. Think of BYT as the In N Out of taco stands: limited menu, but what they make, they make very well. Fresh, full of flavor, tacos, quesadillas, and burritos. You can phone your order in as pick up, and they have all the condiments of a taco stand salsa bar. I didn't ask if they made their own pickles carrots, jalapeños, and onion mix, but the carrots were actually crunchy. They recently opened a location in Gilbert off Ray and Higley, and it fits the area well. Has indoor seating, looks a little upscale. I drive by, but have yet to drop in."}
{"text":"Best tacos to have on Taco Tuesday, and the \"papa loca\" is amazing. All the meats are delicious only thing is the place is always packed but the line goes pretty quick, also go to the one in Mesa not Gilbert just tastes more authentic. Everything on the menu is worth trying!"}
{"text":"Maybe we just had a couple of bad runs. We have been back twice and have really enjoyed our meals both times."}
{"text":"Im so disappointed with drive through again They screw up my order half the time. If you call back to complain, the manager offers nothing but excuses. I'm done with this place. If the food was better I could handle the disrespect. But okay tacos with really bad service NO WAY!"}
{"text":"Well we are not \"Taco Snobs\", but we do know good food.  This was not good food and I was given my mini taco and extra mini tostada on a styrofoam half plate.  I'm not a tree hugger as well, but even I know, this was extremely unacceptable.  And Like everyone else was saying, the salsa bar was much to be desired.  The consistency of the salsa was that of water and no flavor as well.  Would never go back nor recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great tacos at a good price.  I can count on all my kids showing up at my house if they get wind that we're doing Taco Tuesday!  My entire family loves both the beef and chicken tacos and the variety of salsas and hot sauces in their salsa bar!  Just know that the tacos are somewhat small so plan on 3-4 per person.  Another thing that we learned is that the garnish is cabbage rather than lettuce, so be sure to order without if anyone in your family is sensitive to cabbage."}
{"text":"It's so close to my office, they recognize me and know what my \"usual\" is.  I ate here so often when I was pregnant, my son was mostly tacos when he was born.  The tacos are small, so you will probably want to order at least a few (they won't judge if you order them 10 at a time, I know this personally), and remember that rice and beans have to be ordered separately. The salsa bar is amazing, and you can load up on as much guac, onions, cucumbers, limes, etc etc as you can handle.  I highly recommend anything with their carne asada, but seriously, everything is good. 

The line gets a little long during the lunch rush, and it can be a little bit of a wait for your food.  Don't come if you are in a rush, or just sit outside and enjoy the patio while you wait."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Easy menu and service is super fast. My favorite taco was the shredded beef. Also tried the chicken and carne Asada. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I usually love backyard, but I just came in at 9:40 before they where about to close an I get all my food an head home, an then I open up my food an everything was cold! I live 20 mins away so it not like I could go back before they where closed! Super disappointed"}
{"text":"Great tacos, best in Mesa. I try to grab lunch here whenever I'm in the area. Very popular place for lunch so seating is always packed during this time, but the 4 times I've been, I've never had to wait too long for seats to be available. Glad I don't live too close, my wallet and my waistline couldn't take that! Definitely recommend if you haven't been there before, the chicken/pork/steak tacos are all great."}
{"text":"Best tacos in the east valley for sure! The tacos have plenty of meat and they have delicious salsas in the salsa bar. I am a taco lover and I know a good taco when I eat one. If you're in the mood for some tacos you have to come here."}
{"text":"Very tasty tacos in a fun setting but price was way too high. Spent $10 and came away just as hungry as when I walked in. Also, long lines and average service at best."}
{"text":"Food is decent, good little tacos but the prices have gone up. Pretty expensive for what you get.  Usually has a long line and takes a while to order and then get your food. Lots of flies!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place only has a 3 star rating. I think it's really good here. I think the pricing is good. Especially their taco Tuesday deal. The line can sometimes be long, but hat does depend on the time of day you come on. Taco Tuesdays it's usually pretty busy for obvious reasons. Today I got 3 chicken tacos. They tasted hot and fresh. Their tortillas are also really good here. I was happy with my tacos and I would come back and get them again. They also have a salsa bar that's great. I love to get cucumbers and the avocado salsa from it. They have salsas ranging from mild to hot. So, they have something for everyone."}
{"text":"The food was alright, but it gave both me and my aunt food poisoning afterwards. Also NEVER order the horchata from here. It's a little extra to get horchata but it was super powdery and horrible. I told whoever was at the cashier and they just gave me a new cup for a fountain drink. If you're in the mood for tacos and burritos I would recommend going to cafe rio."}
{"text":"The food is good and cheap. But the service sucks. We went through the drive thru and they messed our order up, didn't even apologize or anything. Food good service bad, fix the service and we would come more"}
{"text":"Steak tacos - great

Al Pastor tacos - yummy, except be aware they come with cilantro and not the cabbage they say are on the tacos.

Chicken tacos - bland

Salsa bar - great idea!

I would eat here again but wouldn't go out of my way to do so."}
{"text":"I wouldn't claim that backyard taco is miles ahead of the many, many other taquerias in the area, but what sets them apart is the efficiency in which they manage to crank out those tacos, as well as that mesquite grill. It imparts a little bit extra something to the carne asada and birria, but it's the chicken that benefits the most, adding a ton of extra smoky flavor. The super finely-chopped cabbage and cilantro is a nice touch, and you can't go wrong with any of the salsas. Altogether it adds up to a restaurant that is just slightly better in a lot of little ways, but it adds up to a big difference."}
{"text":"My family and friends went to back yard taco. Wow! The food is awesome.   I ordered chicken tacos and chicken burritos.   It is very delighted.   My family and I will come back to this awesome place.  Joyride taco need to learn from this place, all of you non authentic need to eat here so you'll know what a real Mexican taco, is.   At least this place won't take you for a ride. The food here at back yard taco is very reasonable.."}
{"text":"Amazing delicious tacos! The carne asada on flour tortillas is brilliant. Great fresh food, delicious toppings. I definitely recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"Backyard Taco is very very good! Their tacos are very tasty, sizable, and reasonably priced - something you rarely see in Gilbert just because it's Gilbert.  The menu isn't over complicated, they have a great variety and they just added Al Pastor which is a fantastic menu addition. This location is 10 times bigger than the University location so lots of seating. The patio prob seats more than 50-60 people so it's very spacious. Backyard Taco is now my Go-To for weekly tacos!!"}
{"text":"Great Tacos and quesadillas!  I also like the glass bottle sodas!"}
{"text":"So happy that this taco shop is open!! The tacos are Awesome!!! Best I've had in a while!! Now I can get my taco fix anytime I want!! Staff is great!! Food came out quickly and everything was great!!! If your a snowflake that cries about a long line then take your sorry self to one of the \"bertos\" ghetto taco joints !! These tacos are PRIMO !!! And WELL WORTH THE WAIT"}
{"text":"I usually come here to enjoy a delish taco... my carne asada was sooooo dry and didn't even taste good! What's going on? I couldn't even eat it after one bite. I don't know what happened but terrible tacos. I wish I would've eaten in instead of getting it to go so I could get a refund."}
{"text":"Yum!  Their papa locas are delicious!  Best carne Asada, it's charred just how I like it and their pibil tacos are super juicy and flavorful."}
{"text":"We had an awesome visit here! It was my first place to eat at here in Arizona. I got the carne Asada burrito and it was so so good! The other people in my group got tacos and they loved it. It was incredibly busy but the waitstaff was super friendly and we got our food really fast. The prices are good and I definitely recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Food is incredible and it's awesome to see the meat cooking on coals right behind the counter. The chicken tacos were my favorite. Salsa here is also the real deal. Only downside is how busy the place is. Hard to get a table and move around inside. This is just a byproduct of great cheap food though."}
{"text":"Great food! Love the new location in Gilbert, too. The line is always long and they have problems taking the orders quickly.  They are pretty stingy with chips. The food is really great so I tolerate the slow line"}
{"text":"OMG this place has extremely good food. The tacos are unbelievable... Seating is limited, get there early for lunch."}
{"text":"Favorite taco place ever! The papas locas are also amazing! Tuesdays are a bit crazy, but the discounted tacos are so worth it!"}
{"text":"Food is great, but, victims of their own success. Garbage cans over flowing, nowhere to sit,and when a table opens up no employee around to clean, took forever to change out empty Soda Flavor. 
Avoid on obviously Busy nights, i.e. Fri & Sat"}
{"text":"Amazing food I love going there!! If our looking for Mexican tacos this is the place!!"}
{"text":"Just Ok. Not the great, undiscovered Mexican food palace it was hyped up to be. Friendly place, convenient, and quite busy - at least for now. A lot of mom and pop taquerias are in the east valley and most are pretty good."}
{"text":"Not what it's made out to be. My carne asada tacos were alright. My daughters beans were cold. My sister ordered a quesadilla with carne asada and the cheese wasn't even melted all the way and it looked like they forgot to meat then placed it inside after so it wasn't really hot. My boyfriends burrito wasn't that great either. It's not good enough to us to return."}
{"text":"First of all I hope management sees this review. Rather than comment here for yelpers to see, I wanted to go directly to their website to email management, but there was no option. So, here goes. I want to give this place 1 star, but I just can't bring myself to do it. I have been so excited about this small ma and pa taco shop opening, and I really hope they can get some training in place and succeed! Gilbert needs more local restaurants just like this one!

Food - 2 stars 
Service - 1 star
Flow/Ease of Service - 1 star
Wait time - 1 star
Ambiance - 3 stars

I called my order in to pick up. The gal sounded like she had never taken a pick up order before and had very little knowledge about their product (training issue I'm sure). I also asked if I could do a quesadilla on a corn tortilla instead of flour. I said I understand you probably don't have a button for that, but I'd pay the same as a flour one even though it would be a lot smaller. She still said no! So I just let it go. 

When I arrived to pick up my order 20 minutes later it was still not ready. I would highly recommend a \"pay here for pick up orders\". The line was out the door (cool to see) and no where for those that had called in to go orders, to pay. There was a hard to read, hand written sign at the register that had a long line directly behind it...so it was awkward to cut in. I waited another 10 mins to pay. 

I waited another 25 minutes and finally got my food. And the order was missing two of my tostadas! Glad I checked. So I waited another 5 minutes. By this point I had witnessed pure chaos and SO many unhappy customers while I stood around waiting. Two gals came back in for missing items from their to go orders - and an unsatisfactory response from the manager from what I saw. Several customers came up wondering when their food would be out. If you looked around the restaurant it seemed almost nobody was smiling - customers or staff. Very odd vibe going on. The team behind the counter was unorganized and clearly lacked training and knowledge of what they were doing. I felt bad for them. 

I finally got out of there and got home to eat. They do not have to go containers. I REALLY hope this is something they are working on. Our food looked totally unappetizing and was scattered and smashed all over the plate. They use paper plates and foil over the top. Terrible presentation of food. And ALL of our food was cold when I got home (3 minute drive). The beans and cheese from my tostadas where 90% stuck to the top of the foil. The tacos were smashed and looked like a mess, and like I said, cold. The chips and salsa were nice. Perfectly salted, and they did have little containers for the salsa at least. The avocado salsa was yummy too. But overall what was supposed to be a quick pick up dinner, ended up being a total waste of my money and an hour of my time. 

I will wait a couple of weeks for the kinks to get worked out, and I'll give it another try. I want this place to succeed! The big patio was awesome, wide open space, cute kids tables on patio. I really think it's all about training here. Training, training, training, and getting rid of employees/managers that don't want to provide excellent customer service would go a LONG way to make this place good."}
{"text":"Pretty good prices, and really good food. Some of the down falls is the place is a little too small for how busy they get. Also the parking is crazy especially around lunch time. Other than that i will be back here for sure."}
{"text":"Holy guacamole !!! This place is a Hidden Gem we drove by it a dozen of times until a co-worker mentioned backyard taco and it's location that we finally visited. This place is amazing the food is definitely worth the wait in the line. If you haven't tried it try it for lunch today."}
{"text":"So delicious. The prices for what you get is amazing. The surprise of the night was the crazy potato. That is a little slice of heaven right there. We tried one of everything. We loved all of it."}
{"text":"Nothing special about this place don't know what the big hype is about food is basic tacos are super small and dry and all the salsa they have is all water down I personally like Cafe Rio and plus why open a place up and have the drive thru closed"}
{"text":"My sister in law really likes this place, so I decided to give it a try. I ordered 3 tacos on a flour tortilla-carne asada, pollo, and shredded beef. The flour tortillas are thin, but tasted good. The chicken and carne asada came with shredded cabbage, onion and some secret sauce. The shredded beef had cilantro and onions. I enjoyed the carne asada and the chicken, but not the shredded beef.  Nothing was spicy which was great for me.  
My husband got the same but on corn tortillas and added an al pastor taco. He said he enjoyed his tacos, but felt they needed a better sauce. 
We also ordered an order of chips and salsa for the table. I think that salsa was their medium hot salsa. I tried it and it didn't seem hot. It tasted like tomato juice. 
They do have a salsa bar with a variety of salsa and accoutrements. I tried the pico and the guac. I personally prefer a chunkier guac. But it didn't stop me from eating it. My husband tried a hot salsa from the bar. He thought it was lacking something. 
All in all, I enjoyed the tacos, but felt their salsas could be better."}
{"text":"So glad a friend suggested this place!  Family of 4, with two kiddos, and we all were happy with our meals.  I had the vegetarian crazy potato, which was a really cool menu item.  The place was packed, but the kitchen got food out fairly quickly and there was plenty of outside seating.  Will definitely come back, and recommend to others!"}
{"text":"Got overcharged on my credit card on an order.  I apparently got to pay for another customers meal.  I didn't notice it until the credit card statement came in.  Over $60 for a bean & cheese burrito 2 drinks, and 3 street tacos!  I haven't been back since.  I called over one time to deal with it and the person who answered the phone didn't understand my issue and said there wasn't a manager in. Food was good, but that experience left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Glad they expanded. Now more can enjoy this food. Great prices, fresh food and lots of salsas to try ."}
{"text":"Love, love it. We have been back so many times. My husband loves this place and even dreams about it. Carne asada tacos are so good. I love the cucumbers and the guacamole. Have not tried the burritos yet. You know the food is awesome if you see a diversity of people there. There can be a bit of wait but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Small dive but good hot dogs and a family feel. Not a good neighborhood but worth the trip to pick up a few Sonoran dogs. Inexpensive but still good."}
{"text":"Backyard Taco is awesome. It is certainly no frills, and you can always expect to wait in line a bit, but you'll be back because the food is amazing. My wife loves the crazy potatoes. I usually get steak tacos, but everything we've tried has been good."}
{"text":"I just moved to Arizona, so I had to find some new places for my Mexican fix. Backyard taco lived up to the hype. I've been here 3 times, and even brought my parents here. They loved it. Super cute place, and it's always busy(Even at 10 PM at night). Cheap prices for some seriously flavorful food. I'm a huge fan."}
{"text":"this is my favorite location because no matter how busy, the wait isn't too bad. even on taco tuesday it's a decent wait time; compared to other locations i'd come here over them all for sure"}
{"text":"I have heard great reviews for Backyard Taco, but have been twice now and haven't been very impressed! My first visit I got two tacos (carnitas and al pastor) that were just ok. The carnita one had a huge piece of fat that I had to pick out which didn't leave much meat. I also ordered a side of beans, which ended up being a huge container! The tacos weren't super filling, so two was not enough to fill me up but I didn't order anymore because they weren't very good. The beans were enough to feed our group of four! My second visit I ordered the papa loca and it was ok,  it not something I would order again. It's a baked potato (mashed up without any skin) loaded with meat, etc. They are very generous with the toppings--it took me a while to find the potato at the bottom! The flavors were just pretty bland so be prepared to add lots of salsa to it! I haven't given up on Backyard Taco yet though-it's a fun place to eat with friends so I will be back to hopefully find something I love!"}
{"text":"What can I say... We love BYT! They never disappoint. The tacos are so great we drive from Surprise AZ to eat here."}
{"text":"Good tacos. Not worth the wait. Or the flies. Don't think I will make the trip to eat there again because Julia's in Chandler is WAAAY better and close to my house. 

Sorry. Not impressed. :("}
{"text":"Great chips and salsa! Al pastor tacos are very good, chicken was a little dry though. Will come back again!"}
{"text":"Great place and outstanding food. If you want something authentic you have to checkout Back Yard Taco. Its not your traditional mexican food, the Crazy Potato is amazing and I love the street tacos. I have already referred many family and friends.

Check them out you will be glad you do, or your LOCO if you dont!"}
{"text":"Dear Taco Lovers,
If you love tacos then please welcome yourself to this place!  Don't get shy when its your first time (we've all been there), the wonderful staff will explain everything that you need to know about the food and how they cook everything.  

I'm a firm believer of wonderful, yummy food that's inexpensive on my budget.  Everything is fantastic, trust me I've had everything on the wonderful menu!  I don't know if that's something to be proud of or ashamed of...but I'm thrilled to say that it hasn't let me down.

Don't let the line stop you either, they are fast with the food.  And it won't disappoint you with the few minutes that you had to wait.  Enjoy and take in the day!"}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic tacos, cool ambiance and friendly service. I'm always drawn to local restaurants that offer something rare or unique and this taqueria takes the cake on the crazy potato, amazing salsa bar options, mesquite flavoring of the meat, chips/salsa is off the hook, and authentic mexican drink options. Yum!"}
{"text":"UPDATE 2018- still the BEST taco place in Gilbert but PLEASE give the beachwear a rest...you are NOT in Rocky Point...you know who you are...

All these Taco Snobs who are negative on this place should clear out and stay at On The Border or Del Taco....flavor is very good, quality and portions are also excellent. If you are expecting a platter full of food then you don't understand Street Taco fare. ( and you're mostly likely a 4o inch waist too).

This one would get 5 stars if they had beer offered but for a workday lunch or a quick pop in its Great! 

Going into my regular roation of eats."}
{"text":"If you want to close at 9:30 don't stay open until 10. 
Have heard good reviews of backyard for a while and was close to the new location on Higley this evening. Had to wait several minutes to order as staff was sweeping both front and back of counter. No one ahead of us but no cashier. Finally someone at the pick up station finished the conversation with another employee and wandered our way. No \"hello\", just what do you want. Seemed put out to have to be there. 
Positive side: food was good and the salsa bar was nice. 
I will probably try Backyard Taco again but I'll wait awhile so employees can get training in customer service. Lots of young empl6but no evidence of management on site."}
{"text":"Best street tacos around! Great salsa bar. Good chips. Fun environment. Can't wait for the drive-thru to open. My husband had the carne asada burrito, it was huge and delicious! I had pork tacos, that were so yummy."}
{"text":"This place had been highly recommended by many friends, and while the food was good, it left me feeling underwhelmed. 

I loved the atmosphere, and how well kept it was, especially when I frequent many hole-in-the-wall Mexican food places with my husband. And my favorite thing from the menu was the baked potato. But, I felt like the tacos were just not quite there in flavor. I will probably give it another chance at some point, though."}
{"text":"Lemonade is delicious!! Street tacos are really small for the price. They should be like half what they cost. Chicken and steak tend to be pretty dry. Guacamole is running green stuff, not at all guacamole. Overall it's alright but over priced for just alright"}
{"text":"Tacos are amazing. Great staff. I will go there anytime I'm in the area. I wish I was out in that area more often."}
{"text":"There was over an hour wait to pick up some tacos to go. The food was mediocre at best. They forgot my chips in my to go order as well. Don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great tacos, great burritos, this is my go-to place if I don't want the restaurant sit down experience."}
{"text":"Good things come to those who wait. This isn't your ordinary fast food. Be prepared to invest some time and money into your lunch/dinner, It will be well worth it! I recommend the Carne Asada tacos or the crazy potato! Then take yourself to the salsa bar to load up extra fixings on that perfect meal. Owners are terrific, the staff is friendly, and the restaurant is very clean and open. Seating is open and available inside and outside. This is a 2nd location and my preference over the original Mesa location."}
{"text":"They grill most things over Mesquite grill which gives them a good flavor.  All the meat is overcooked and a little dry but it is offset by a great taste of the Mesquite grilling and the Guacamole salsa add moisture and great flavor as well.  This place is always busy with locals having lunch and dinner.  The portions are a bit small for the price."}
{"text":"I haven't had chicken tacos with so much flavor in such a long time ! I love the drive through for the days that you just don't want to stab in line"}
{"text":".   I ordered the family pack and you would assume if you are getting 16 shells and meat  you should be able to get a container for the salsa bar as well to fill those shells.   Nope you get the little cups for single serve. I was told by the cashier sorry.   I said you would rather me fill up 16 cups  each for salsa, cucumbers and gauc then give me a  couple small foam container. She said yes.  She then offered to sell me a container for another $2.50.  So I could get my Free fixings from the fixing bar. I think if you order the family pack you should be able to get a small container for fixings, especially when the order is to go. The family pack is not worth it if you are doing carry out.."}
{"text":"Came because of all the good reviews, but I wasn't really impressed. I had to illegally park across the street since every spot in their small lot was taken and I just think the food was too bland to bother going back."}
{"text":"We showed up here late on a Friday night and there were a lot of people eating and enjoying the evening.  We ordered some steak tacos, chicken tacos and a chicken Crazy Potato.  It was all very good and the food came quickly and tasted fresh.  Solid little place for good food."}
{"text":"Backyard Taco has bybfar the best tacos in town. Whether it is taco Tuesday or a family pack and head home it is our go to taco joint."}
{"text":"Love!!!
Super fresh ingredients.  
Always packed in there Cuz they're so good. 
Fast service with a smile! A+"}
{"text":"Probably some of the best tacos I've ever had. Taco Tuesday deals are excellent. It was under $10 for 6 tacos and they were quick"}
{"text":"My husband is very picky about his tacos. We make the best tacos at home. But I have to say backyard taco in Gilbert is very very good. I also loved their baked potatoes. You must go visit."}
{"text":"I love tacos and I love Taco Tuesdays. This place is an old favorite of mine. The staff is always friendly and the food is affordable and pretty good. Backyard Taco serves up Tacos al Carbon (cooked over charcoal). When you walk into the lobby you can see and smell the meat grilling on the mesquite grill behind the cashier. The couple that started this place got their start grilling tacos for friends and family in their backyard. So hospitality and making customers feel at home is a big part of their business. They use fresh simple ingredients along with their selection of meats to create the delicious authentic taste of Tacos al Carbon. They also do quesadillas, burritos, tostadas, gorditas and a crazy potato. I got a variety of tacos this time around that included Al Pastor, Carne Asada and Pollo. Al Pasor is my favorite street taco and the meat they cook up here is nice and juicy. My favorite thing about Backyard Taco is the condiment bar which has all types of salsas, onions, limes and jalapeños for toppings. If you come here on Taco Tuesdays, tacos are $1.79 from 2-10pm."}
{"text":"Love Backyard Taco! The chicken tacos and quesadillas are awesome! And my girls love the bean and cheese burritos!"}
{"text":"Backyard Taco is like that 80s cult movie that everybody likes, but when you watch it, and really look at it objectively, the best part about it is the nostalgia.  It has such a cult following that it was guaranteed to be successful the day it opened its doors... And considering they used to operate an illegitimate back yard operation (hence the name), it's kind of deserved, isn't it?

First, the good things.  The facility is nice.  And their claim is that they keep the menu simple so that they only serve what they're good at.  This seems to be true about their salsa, carne asada tacos, and chicken tacos, but not their cheese quesadillas.  The quesadilla was boring and flavorless.  But the tacos had great flavor, especially the chicken one.

At some point, however, if you want to run a real top-of-the-line taco operation, you have to expand the horizons a little bit.  They don't have any of the nice juicy stuff they serve at the more legit places, like chorizo, lengua, cabeza, pastor... Are they afraid their mostly-white-Mormon clientele won't eat these? (OK, that might be a legitimate concern.)  They don't even serve carnitas.  No pescado.  No camaron.

With their limited offerings, it's hard to make an argument that they serve anything close to the best tacos in the Valley.  Atoyac is better, La Condesa is way better, Moreno's may even be better.  I'm tempted to even say Tia Rosa Tacqueria is even better as far as tacos are concerned.

This is great food if you're inviting people over to have dinner in your back yard.  But if you're running a restaurant, you have to offer more than the two most boring meat choices on Earth."}
{"text":"It's amazing that Del Taco & Taco Bell even exist in this area with authentic cuisine like this.  An open flame mesquite grill welcomes you on first sight along with the delicious smell of open fire and smoke flavors.  I can see why this place is always packed, but the food does come fast.  I had 3 tacos on corn tortillas, carne asada, chicken, and pork.  The house homemade salsa is deep smoky flavored with a kick.  The fixings bar has orange hot salsa, plus green guacamole, pico Del Gallo, cucumbers, pickled red onions, sliced radishes. Etc.  OMG.  Best Tex-Mex since I have been in Mesa/PHX.  The outdoor eating area even has cooling water misters to keep you cool from the salsa heat. Coming back for more."}
{"text":"It's Good, It's Busy, It's worth the trip and wait in line.  

Tasty Tacos, Crispy Chewy Gorditas, Flavorful Beans and Tasty Tortillas - Plus the Tortilla Chips are Hot, Thin, Properly Salted and Come With A Salsa that is Exclusive to the Chips.

Here you will find reasonably priced freshly made food, that is constantly being cooked and prepared.  There is a swarm of people coming, going and socializing and eating.  There is a salsa bar that will please most any pallet, although I would like to see a slight pickle to the carrots and onions, however, the cucumbers and radish have a nice crisp crunch.

The tacos are of the 6\" corn or flour tortilla variety as are the gorditas.  The burritos are ample in size and satisfying, the quesadillas are nicely sized and cheesy.  The Papa Loca (a baked potato, mashed, mixed with cheese and choice of meat) is filling and yummy.  The beans are good all by themselves or in a burrito sprinkled with cheese; also flavorful is the chicken and birra meats as fillings.

All in all, Backyard Taco pleases the need for a street style taco or burrito or Mexican fix that is big on flavor and easy on the wallet."}
{"text":"I've been a few times now since the grand opening, and haven't been disappointed. The staff is friendly and my food comes out correct every time!"}
{"text":"Ordered two beef tacos on corn tortillas and I have to say I was thoroughly impressed with how authentic and amazingly delicious these tacos were!  Coming from Texas, I have been on the hunt for the past 5 years for an amazing taco joint.  Sadly, I have been disappointed time and time again.  That is, until I met the good people at Backyard Taco and tasted their amazing Mexican food.  I'm happy that I no longer have to travel 1500 miles to feel like I'm getting the best tacos on this side of the border.  Way to go Backyard Taco!"}
{"text":"Tough to beat Mexico's street tacos or my mom. No al pastor or much variety on meat, but there salsa's are hot and not watered down. The restaurant is very nice with covered patio and clean. Music plays outside and for those \"cold nights\" they have outdoor post warmers."}
{"text":"Great tacos! We had the carne Asada and the chicken tacos. You can order either corn or flour tortillas, and all the fixings are in a topping bar on the side. I love that they grill all the meat inside over a hot fire stove.  It does make the taste more authentic, and the smell is heavenly.
We phoned in our order ahead of time, but still had to wait about 15 minutes for it once we got there and paid because it was pretty much the highlight of their lunch rush. Even so they were helpful,  accurate, and the tacos were really good!"}
{"text":"Not the best...I am sorry to say, I wish it were better. The house Salas's has too much acidic flavor? Lime juice i think? The taco meat was bland had a chicken, carne, Birria and I can honestly say I was not overwhelmed with flavor. In fact the meats were bland. Not even sure how that is possible because the chicken has an amazing orange hue covering every piece implying it was marinated for a very long time and slow cooked to perfection. None the less it was as bland as the shredded beef (birria) I am a huge connoisseur of actual Mexico street tacos...if you want tasty \"flavorful\" Carne hit up the pork shop in the QC...sorry Backyard Tacos I really wanted to enjoy your tacos more...:("}
{"text":"The family and I go here every Tuesday night as well as whenever a craving hits. Love love love their chicken tacos, carne is amazing too!! This place is the bomb!! Seriously...if you've never eaten here before you've got to try it!!!"}
{"text":"Have tacos?  Will travel.  And apparently when it comes to Ruben and Marciela Alvarez' taco stand in Mesa, I'm not the only one.  Taco stands are a dime a dozen in the valley, but only so many gain such a wild following as this place.  Closing in a thousand Yelp reviews and a crazy high score, there's gotta be something special going on here.  I figured this was probably more of a lunch spot than a dinner destination for most.  So on a Saturday night, I confidently drove myself to the east valley for what I was sure would be a quiet evening of taco nirvana.

Yeah, about that.  Backyard's flagship location in Mesa can be found on the north side of University Drive in between Stapley and Gilbert Roads (they also now have a second location in Gilbert).  You can't miss the brightly colored inviting looking building.  You also can't miss the crowds.  Holy moly was it busy.  I had to park a block away for my first visit here and by the time I got in line there were about 15 people in front me.  Fortunately the line moves at a decent clip and they've crammed in a surprisingly decent amount of seating into this modest sized operation (I'd say 50 or so seats on the patio and another 20 inside).  And like so many other great taco stands I visit in the valley, the crowd is a mix of all ages, nationalities, backgrounds, you name it.

Standing in line for awhile gave me plenty of time to survey the simple menu chalkboard up front and make my decision.  One of every taco they sell (don't worry, there's only 4 types), a large horchata, and a flan.  Total cost including tax came to about $16.  After just over 5 minutes they called my number and I grabbed an open seat in the corner inside.  Let's talk about the tacos (for the record I went with corn tortillas instead of flour).  The tacos are as follows:  A carne asada (chopped beef), an al pastor (pork),  pollo (chicken), and birria (shredded beef).  Each taco is topped with onions, cabbage, cilantro, and a house blend red sauce.  I was super happy with all but one of my tacos.  The beef and pork tacos were all perfectly cooked, juicy, and blended perfectly with the tortilla.  The pollo taco I had was on the dry side and combined with the dry corn tortilla had texture that was a little tough.  As for the flan, I have no complaints about the portion size and the flavor was pleasant enough.  Though I'll admit I like a flan that's a little softer than what Backyard offers.  As for the horchata, nothing but thumbs up from me for this beautiful beverage.

So they weren't perfect (at least not tonight), but there's plenty to love about this place.  Despite a packed house, they keep the facility quite clean, the staff at the counter were quite upbeat and watching them cook the meat over the open fire behind the register is quite a sight.  And with everything from teenagers out on dates, to families, to late night workers, to elderly folk coming in and out all evening, Backyard has clearly been lovingly embraced by the Mesa community.  Not bad for a Mazatlan born couple who got their start making tacos for friends in their own backyard."}
{"text":"Life is better with burritos
I'm glad this place is not too far from my house. The burritos are enormous

Taste? Delicious, spicy, juicy beef (ordered a carne asada). Can't ask for more. Plus there is an unlimited salad bar. Funny how some lady brought her own container to get these condiments

Price? A little bit pricey for a burrito but it is huge with lots of meat. Plus they grill these beef on charcoal. The horchata is cheap tbh. $3 for a L

Service? Fast food restaurant, fast service. Great overall"}
{"text":"So my 5 star is changing to a 2. Unfortunately I had high hopes for this place but it has gone hill since day one. Aside from accidentally charging me $2,000 the food has been worse than ever. The original one was so good but just like every business they start opening more doors and the quality and and consistency goes right down the drain. On another note the employees park across the street and jaywalk all the time not to mention I live in the neighborhood and have to smell the smoke from this place all the time, it stinks."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken, pork and beef Tacos. The beef tacos were dry and flavorless. The pork tacis were the most flavorful, of course, but notging too exciting. I wish tge tacos came with more cabbage because I like the crunch. The condiments (green sauce, pico, cucumber, radish) were offered. Wish I hax enjoyed them more."}
{"text":"Meat was WAY WAY over salted.  Guac was so watered down it didn't taste like anything.  The place was so smoky inside there's no way we could've stayed, not to mention it was sweltering.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"IMHO this place is totally over rated. And, a bit pricey too. First, they are as busy as the other reviewers said, there was a constant line of people ordering, eating and going. If you want a relaxed meal, this is positively not your place to eat!

Both my husband and I felt the food was pretty bland - even when all the toppings. 

Basically, okay food, but not great. Would we go back - probably not, there are so many other restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Crazy Potato (Papa Loca) is the best! Mexican version of a twice-baked potato. Be sure to get it with all the fixin's. Good value and a nice renovation of an old building."}
{"text":"Give it a 2.7... Service is good.  Getting food is not a long wait.  Prices are decent.  Not enough seating. 

Don't waste your time on ordering birria tacos.  It is not.   Birria is made from goat not beef. It is dry.  Doesn't have the juice.  No flavor in the carne asada.  Needed seasoning.  Cabbage is grated not cut.  Guacamole is gross .  Tacos Al pastor had the most flavor.  I rather drive three hours to Mexicali,  Baja California to get my tacos from  Ataclan."}
{"text":"I live right around the corner from BYT so when they opened up I was hoping against hope that it would be a great place to eat. You see, this area of Mesa is a foodie black-hole. In order to have a decent meal you have to travel across Mesa to reach a decent restaurant. I've been to BYT several times now, reserving judgement until I had experience the place enough and I have to say it's pretty disappointing. I've been to Mexico and have experienced authentic street tacos, but I've found BYT's to be very dry and tasteless. To top it off, it's pretty expensive for the portion size."}
{"text":"Love love love it. Next to cali Mexican food this is pretty amazing. But if they had beer I would have given them 5 stars. Food is worth the stop beer or not."}
{"text":"On a dark and stormy night, rain was pouring, I'd say at least an 8th of an inch worth drizzled across the car windshield.  I found myself in Mesa, a 'business transaction' of sorts was going down nearby. \"Let's meet at my place,\" said the voice on the end of the phone. We've never met before, but something about the big box of clothes my friend Craig told me about for super cheap brought me out this way. After the deal had been struck, hands a shaken and cash exchanged, it was time to eat. 

I opened Yelp, went to nearby restaurants and what did I find 1.3 miles away but Backyard Taco. I thought \"this is my chance,\" I've never been this close before and hungry at the same time, yes, this truly was my chance. Tacos for $2, burritos, family platters, salsa, chips. The choices are endle, well, your choices are pretty much tacos and burritos, but when you do it right, you don't need endless.

I don't find myself galavanting through Mesa often, but now that I've tried backyard taco, I might just need to.

Eat carne asada, eat chicken, eat the salsa, eat it all, it was sooo delicious. Happy yelping Phoenix!"}
{"text":"So apparently they can't take an order. I ordered a carne asada burrito and they gave me a bean burrito. When my wife went to exchange it for me the older lady behind the counter that originally took our order said thats what we ordered. Thanks for basically calling us liars backyard taco!"}
{"text":"Hands down best tacos in the city! Wood fired, slow grilled, meaty miracles wrapped in a tortilla!!! Writing this is making me hungry. Thank you backyard taco."}
{"text":"BYT is the best! Super friendly, and the quickest service around. They make the most out of the  small space and have crowds daily. Quesadilla with chicken or carne is soooo good!"}
{"text":"Tacos were good, place is small and not enough room. Crowds at the salsa bar...:("}
{"text":"I seek out this place when I'm in this part of town, and it's rare that I can get in the door. Lucky me today! 

Today's choice was the carne asada tacos: flavorful, tender, and delicious! Prices reasonable as always. Food came out quickly and everyone was friendly!

Salsa bar tip: try the tatemada. I tried it and the jalapeno, and it was definitely the more flavorful of the two. 

In summary, go if you're in the area. If not, drive over and get some tacos!"}
{"text":"Great place with awesome Assad tacos. Reasonable pricing, but has funks hours of operation. Other than that I love it!!!"}
{"text":"I am from a Texas town close to the border, so I am pretty picky about the Mexican food I eat and was skeptical to try Backyard Taco. Boy, what a nice surprise this place turned out to be! I ordered two tacos, one al pastor and one carne asada please! They were delicious! The meat was marinated perfectly and you could taste the yummy smokiness from the grill in each bite. The medium salsa tasted fresh with a touch of heat. I left feeling very satisfied and I know my tastebuds danced a jig or two! I will definitely be back. Nice job!"}
{"text":"Quick service ,  good food , pricing was reasonable. Environment is loudly with music playing. One more plus is the nice patio."}
{"text":"Tacos are the answer.....it doesn't matter what the question was......

One of the best tips I ever got about eating tacos is to always eat them over an empty tortilla, then when you're done you'll have one more delicious taco to gorge on!

And Backyard Taco is just the place for overindulging on tacos.  Get the family pack and you will not be disappointed....1lb of meat, 16 taco shells, and all the fixings for just over $25.  Killer deal.  BONUS!  No one is grilling their taco the Backyard does...the meat is just juicy and grilled full of smoky flavor.  One of kind and worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Items Ordered:  (3) Carne Asada Tacos ($1.89ea), (1) Carne Asada Tostada ($2.89), (1) Carne Asada Crazy Potato ($6.49)

Total Bill:  Under $19

Level of Delight:  Very High

QUICK TIPS FOR BACKYARD TACO:
  - Never been there when seats are available indoors.  Be prepared to sit on the patio.
  - They use mesquite wood grill to cook their meats to perfection.
  - Expect authentic tacos, just like homemade.
  - Service is fast.

We have visited Backyard Taco many times now and it just keep us coming back for more.  For starters, when you get out of your vehicle the first thing you will be greeted by is the amazing aroma of burning mesquite wood.  That's right, they are cooking on real mesquite wood fire grills.

What we especially like about Backyard Taco is the way they chop everything so fine.  The meat is chopped small so it shapes out your taco shell perfectly.  Then the cabbage topping is almost minced to provide a crunchy, yet somehow fluffy taco topping.  Don't forget the sauces from the topping bar.  They have a very nice, almost dressing-like guacamole.

And you CANNOT LEAVE without trying a CRAZY POTATO.  Baked potato lovers beware, this may change your life.  They start with a foil packet that stands up on your plate like some sort of crazy 1970's space souvenir.  Then they fill the bottom of the packet with a super soft baked potato.  The potato itself is not chunky like a baked potato but more like the consistency of mashed potatoes.  They proceed to cover it in a meat of your choice, cheese, sour cream, cabbage, and salsa.  Just dig in that fork and see what kind of ooey gooey goodness comes out.

UPDATE:  8/16/16 - We finally got to sit inside!"}
{"text":"So good!  I love the way the al pastor sauce has little chunks of pineapple.  This place is delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is the Bomb, amazing tacos and the workers there are very friendly. For sure coming back here."}
{"text":"Meat is great, salsa is great, it's just yummy!!! The re-fried beans are bland but everything else is so good. You need like 4 tacos to fill you up though and they are pricey. But again, we keep coming back so I'd say it's worth the price!"}
{"text":"Just above average tacos. Food is good and service is fine. Other Mexican places in the area are just as good or better."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I ate here today!!! It was delicious and reminded me of tacos from Tucson where you could go anywhere to find them. I was disappointed to move up here and find no real good taco shops. But then I ate here and I'm so happy to find my new taco spot! I love the guacamole sauce and the carne asada is so freaken good!!!!! I highly recommend trying it out, you won't be disappointed!

Also for those of you complaining about the size of the menu, sometimes simplicity tastes better. This place doesn't need all the extra things on the menu because it doesn't need it. Plus it's not some fancy restaurant that needs to cater to your needs."}
{"text":"Great food, very authentic, I lived in Mazatlan for a time and this is just like the tacos I got there."}
{"text":"So excited that a taco place was coming to our neighborhood, but so disappointed in the tacos. It's pretty hard to make a bad taco in my opinion, but they sure did. Flavorless, tiny portions, and the salsa bar that looked so enticing was flavorless as well? Supposedly these are recipes from Mexico...well I've been all over Mexico and of this was served they would be out of business. Needless to say we will not be back. For amazing, authentic, flavorful tacos and other items just head down the street to Mucha Lucha and you won't be sorry. They blow this place out of the water."}
{"text":"Wonderful carne asada, and amazing al pastor tacos.  I will return here again at any time."}
{"text":"Los mejores tacos, me acordé cuando era niño y mi papá me llevaba a unos tacos en Mexicali."}
{"text":"Wow!  I'm so happy I tried this place!  I love Yelp and the opportunity to find amazing little 'pocket' restaurants.  I'll be a regular!"}
{"text":"Love this location! It's bigger, airy, feels clean with nice outside dining. The menu is larger than I remember, but it's been awhile since we went to the original so I could be wrong. 

Service was friendly and with personality (which I love), nice salsa bat with slicked cucumber and radishes (Yum!)

I had one taco of each type of meat. The husband liked the carne asada most (my least fav but that'd because I don't prefer the taste of cooked over charcoal). The chicken was good too but the other beef (birra?) was my fav. Long story short...there's something for everyone for a great price, atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place another shot today since I was in the area. I shouldn't have. I went through the drive thru and this time the food was even more unappetizing than the last. I ordered a steak quesadilla and a chicken taco. The steak was fatty and the taco had a weird smell like maybe the oil used to cook the tortilla had gone rancid.  Both wound up in the trash."}
{"text":"It was good.  Don't know if I would return as it is out of the way.  Also, it did fill me up all the way either.  Fresh food and great patio."}
{"text":"The price per taco is ridiculous, mexican street style tacos are supposed to be inexpensive.  I never got the hype of this place , the wait makes it worse.  Pleenty of other places with better tacos for less.  This is for the soccer mom , white washed eaters that are afraid to walk into a Restaraunt with Spanish writing on the front door"}
{"text":"Good food,  simple as the name implies. I had been extremely hyped up by numerous people going into dinner  (I guess I should've have kept in my head is tacos not 5 star dining) wasnt disappointed but have also had better for less in my travels"}
{"text":"Delicious! Tastes just like the street tacos in Mexico and the cheese quesadillas are to die. Do yourself a favor and call your order in ahead of time."}
{"text":"We first found out about Backyard Taco when they initially opened in Mesa. We went there when they first opened and it was so good! Did you know that the tacos used to only be $1/taco? Went today to the Gilbert location, and found out it's $1.79/taco (on taco Tuesday) and $2.25/taco on other days. Wow, big jump! I thought perhaps the quantity/sizes or something would be different for the big price hike... I was wrong. The carne asada \"meat\" is not the same; it's dry and combined with what seems like 1-2 other types of meat. The corn tortillas used to be so good too. This is coming from someone who grew up eating beans, rice and carne asada in a 100% Spanish household/family. I know that nothing will have the taste of home, but it used to come close... now, I feel that they've gotten selfish due to their exploding popularity, and as a result hiked up the prices, for worse food! Disappointing really."}
{"text":"Two years ago, the food and prices were fantastic. Fast forward to 2015, the prices have gone from what was $1.25 a taco to $1.89. Yes, I understand it's less than $2, but the size of the taco is super small. The carne asada is what used to draw me in, however, it is now very coarse and dry. Super sad that this place with so much potential has deteriorated into a dirty shack without delicious food. We probably will not return."}
{"text":"Literally AMAZING. Went today for the first time, and now I know why it's so popular. Got 2 steak tacos that were plenty, and all the salsas are amazing (the orange one is HOT so watch out!). It came out fast, fresh, and hot. Simple toppings, simple recipes, amazing taste. You can't go wrong here, folks."}
{"text":"When I die, assuming I get to go to heaven, I hope there is a fresh plate of backyard tacos waiting for me at the pearly gates."}
{"text":"I would give it a 3, my husband a 5 so we are compromising with a 4. The meat was tender but not particularly flavorful to me. The various sauces were interesting to try but only one of them appealed to me (3 for my husband). Service was basic, the place was crowded but it was cleaned as quickly as possible with the crowds. I wouldn't go out of my way for it but my husband would."}
{"text":"Los mejores tacos al carbón , recomendados a toda mi gente latina en el este Del Valle, sobre todo la barra de salsas y verduras y aquí no cobran el guacamole aparte"}
{"text":"The shredded beef tacos are really tasty with the pickled onions and some lime. 

Prices are reasonable. 

But their other meat looked really gross. I'm super picky about meat, and their chicken and pork (I got a sample of each) was really chewy with questionable pieces, like tendons and such. I'll stick to the shredded beef, I think."}
{"text":"All of the positive reviews are accurate. This is one of the best casual restaurants I've visited in a long time. First I was excited to see a clean and well-maintained building and property. Then the exquisite mesquite grill aromas pulled me inside where my group was greeted with friendly smiles and helpful staff. The menu offers just the right amount of options, all reasonably priced. After a short wait, we were all really happy campers enjoying our lunch on the cute patio area that has misters. Can't wait to return to this Mesa gem."}
{"text":"Best tacos around. We just moved from Chicago were Mexican food is pretty good so it's been hard to find places that are not just throwing together a slip of ingredients. They are really clean, the food is made fresh and quick service. The tacos are my favorite."}
{"text":"The tacos are great, the only downside to the place is the really good tacos are tiny and way more costly than they should be. Even knowing that I still find myself stopping by from time to time."}
{"text":"Hubby-  Had a little time to kill between my daughters softball games and looked up places to eat on the phone.  This place popped up and looked to have great reviews.  Had some family in town that came with me and we were pleasantly surprised.  Had tacos for myself and a burrito to go for my daughter.  Place was packed at 2:15 so a good sign.  Very clean and efficient.  Food was delicious all around.  I can see what all the buzz is about.  If you get a chance I recommend giving this place a shot.  Clean, great service, cooks are quick and employees were constantly cleaning tables keeping places available for the steady flow of customers."}
{"text":"I have been eating at BackYard Tacos for about a year now. Never disappointed. Food is always great. Just recently they updated the menu and added a new item. Amazing food. Yum! I had tooken my boyfriend here, was his first time. He loved it all. Shocked with the outcome of his order. Definitely satisfied us both. We're both regulars with this place and recommend BackYard Tacos to new comers. Don't be shy. Pull in and Order. Not hard. Enjoy every bite."}
{"text":"We have been big fans of Backyard Taco and have been going to the Mesa location for years. The food is fresh, authentic, and delicious. The stuffed baked potato with carne asada is so unique and a family favorite. We love the simplicity of the tacos and usually order the birria (shredded beef). I'm just happy that it's finally closer to me so I don't have to drive 40 minutes to get fabulous Mexican food."}
{"text":"The tacos are great! The salsas and chips are not so great. The chips look like they are store bought. The wait was pretty long as it was Cinco De Mayo but it moved quickly. Overall the experience was good but I'll just go for the main courses from now on."}
{"text":"I had a solid experience here. It was highly recommended by a handful of people so I had to try it out. The stuff potatoes they have there are really good, I would just request extra meat because there is usually a good amount of potato left over. 
I would say, it isn't the best tacos I've had, but I can't complain with what I experienced."}
{"text":"Made it to this spot for the first time yesterday. Tried el pastor, asada, and chicken tacos and the flan. Wow! I asked where the owner was from and when they said Sinaloa (I have a bias for tacos from northern Mexico), I was like.....\"this has a lot of potential.\" The street style tacos and Mesquite flavor really did it for me. Plus great salsas. It is surprising to me how hard it can be to get good tacos, often the ingredients are stale or are too hipster/gourmet. This place has the best tasting tacos I have had in Arizona."}
{"text":"I've had the chicken quesadilla, taco and carne asada burrito.  All are fantastic.  Staff is very friendly.  The facilities are clean.  Most importantly, I feel safe eating their food.  Last month I got food poisoning from a local ghetto Mex restaurant.  Eat here!"}
{"text":"This place was just \"ok\" for me. I think what bothered me most was the amount of fly's inside....gross! The salsa bar was good (everything seemed fresh & cold). I've had better tortilla chips  &  the chicken taco's were average.....How can you not serve rice??? Anywho, that's my white girl review. Maybe I'll try it again, maybe not!"}
{"text":"I honestly don't know why this place is always so busy. I mean it's ok but nothing amazing. I thought the food was mediocre compared to the price and there were just way too many people in there. Maybe if I'm off during a weekday I may try them again but definitely not during evening hours."}
{"text":"So good! Fresh ingredients, great salsa bar... stoked to have such a great taco spot come to our neighborhood"}
{"text":"Always love it here. Food is always fresh and super yummy. The staff is always nice as well. We come here 2x a month. Well priced and delicious food."}
{"text":"I really wanted a potato taco.....it would be nice if the menu stated that the crazy potatoes are not tacos but instead potato tubs.  I ordered to go and thought it was strange getting 3 containers....I questioned it when my order was ready and staff told me it was the potatoes...so I left thinking that i had the tortillas in the bag also and would just assemble them at home.....wrong! But my fault for not looking through the bag before leaving. So I ended up heating up my own tortillas and made my potato tacos.  Not what I expected."}
{"text":"Back yard Taco is super good. They have a lot of cheese in their food and kind of unique food. I am just a white person but I've Been to Mexico a few times and back yard Taco taste like the food I get in Mexico which it is really really good. They also have a stuffed potato which is personally my favorite stuffed potato from anywhere."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Got all the way home with a very large order for 15 people and realized there was several things missing. When we called, the girl who answered was very rude and short with us and told us we needed to prove that not everything was there. Said we needed to pack everything up and bring it in. We already had several kids and adults eating. I will never go back. So so rude to us. If I could give this no stars I would."}
{"text":"My husband and and sister in law are crazy for this place..... 

To me... It's ok... 

I just don't have the urge or cravings for it.  My sister in law will steal our car for their food.   

So 3 stars are for my rating of \"meh\".  

For husband, it's 4 stars.  

For sister in law, she needs an intervention 5 stars"}
{"text":"The meat is always dry the lines are always long and it's a little overpriced........"}
{"text":"This place not bad, but it's also in no way good. Everything is bland and very white washed. There is plenty of authentic Mexican food in Gilbert, but not here. I ate with three people and we all said we wouldn't be interested in coming back. Nice restaurant and staff underwhelming food."}
{"text":"Very, very disappointed here. Ordered at the drive through and brought it back home 6 minutes away. I ordered a steak quesadilla with only meat and cheese but all I received was a tortilla with some bland carne asada on it, not even a hint of cheese. Also ordered some chicken tacos which were very dry and had very little flavor. The only flavor I tasted was onion because they were LOADED on the top, but even after scraping them off I still tasted heavy onion.  Lastly, I ordered the chips and salsa, but got stale chips.  Will not be returning here."}
{"text":"This place is SO GOOD! My husband and I went on Taco Tuesday (discounted tacos? uhm YES) and got one of each kind. They were amazing and all the sauces and salsas were great complements. Their horchata was awesome too! Thanks so much, Backyard Taco staff! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Loved their tacos and gorditas! Their carne asada is amazing and their salsa options are great! A must try definitely!"}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best steak taco on flour tortilla I have ever had. On Tuesday they appear to have a special on tacos, only 1.59$ each. Given this deal plus how amazing the tacos are, it's worth the drive no matter where in the valley you are coming from. If they can keep their quality, I expect great things out of this place."}
{"text":"My favorite place for tacos!!!!!! I eat here at least twice a week. Such a good price point and the carne asada quesadilla is my favorite. There is always a line out the door which is a huge sign that this place is GREAT. I don't mind waiting when I know the food exceeds expectations every time."}
{"text":"Sad to say I was underwhelmed. I was so looking forward to finally trying Backyard Taco. I had one of every type of taco, and a carne asada quesadilla. The pollo and al pastor were decently flavored. But everything was totally smothered in lettuce and onion. The carne asada was very dry.  I will say the ease of the drive thru was nice. I'll probably try again to see if this was a one off and update, but my overall impression right now is \"meh\""}
{"text":"Wonderful street taco place, but clean and open. Food is excellent! The tacos are kind of small though. Highly recommend you at least order three!"}
{"text":"Amazing tacos! My only suggestions would be to order to take out. It's very difficult to find seating when it's busy and the wait can be a bit long on a Friday or Saturday nights. That said, the wait is WORTH IT!!!"}
{"text":"Came here on Thursday night and it was a 55 minute wait, which was to be expected! It's brand new. The little boy who greeted us at the door was so sweet. The cashier was helpful, answering our questions. As we were getting water, there were 2 rude employees restocking the straws, ice, etc. Even if you're not happy, at least put a smile on your face so it's not so obvious. We ordered our food, and it wasn't bad but wasn't great. Luke warm. The chips and salsa were good, as well as the steak quesadilla. I'll give it another try after the crowd dies down."}
{"text":"Those were some tasty tacos. Also, the ambiance was upbeat compared to any other late night taco spot I've been to in Phoenix or San Diego."}
{"text":"The best taco place ever! The first time we visited here we were helped & guided by a service crew, Natalie if im not mistaken, she's our favorite staff here, very attentive to all the costumers & always with a smiling face, she let us try the meats that they have so we can decide what to get. I decided to get the chicken tacos & my husband got steak tacos, all were good! We try to go here atleast twice a week, I also recommended this place to my brother & he's been a fan ever since. Their lemonade & flan are good too!"}
{"text":"Packed at 10:30 PM on a Friday night.

Great tacos.  My favorite between the carne asada and birria (shredded beef) was the birria.  Got free chips and salsa from checking in on yelp.  Chips were stale and didn't care for the salsa it came with.  Nice salsa bar!  The avocado sauce is so light and refreshing.  Good liminada aqua fresca.

The family pack for $25 with a pound of meat and 16 tortillas, etc seems like a really good deal."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite taco places it's a great place for the family nice place to hang out the food is always freshly cooked parking is not a problem!

Juslkeme"}
{"text":"After hearing about this place being the best, my girlfriend and I decided to try it and its not what everyone makes it to be w could have payed way less buying the ingredients ourselfs and taste the same or even better. We bought a total for 4 tacos each and 2 drinks and ended up paying $25. They only have 3 different meats for the tacos as well chicken fish and carne asada. Seriously so not worth it save your money and go to a little hole in the wall it will be just a good or maybe even better and way less expensive.... Hope this helps some of you out there"}
{"text":"It's good.  

The novelty of their story and the very well designed restaurant with unique  marketing flair doesn't move them to great in my book.  

Ingredients were fresh, the papa loco is a really cool concept that blended well and had great flavor.  Service was quick and overall was a good experience.  Priced right!  ultimately a trip here turns into a fun economical eating experience.  

However, the carne asada had a bunch of \"bouncies\" in the meat which may not be as much of a hinderance to other yelpers, but the flan may have been one of the worst I've tried.  

Again, it's good."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and it's always filling and fresh. This last time not so. The meat was dry and portions are getting smaller. The asada used to be tender, large chunks of tasty steak but now it's chopped to cat food size and dry.
The al pastor was great but just disappointed at the lack of quality compared to months past.
Not sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"Can't believe this place has 3.5 stars! All the negative reviews are crazy to me.  I have been to this location many times,  Mesa location many times and have always received awesome food and great service. I understand there can be some miscommunication instances which may result into a bad review.  But the food stands on its own.  If this is not good to you, something is wrong with you, not the place.  

To all the bad reviewers, you truly are insatiable.  You'd complain that your ice is too wet, your steak is too meaty, or the tables are too flat. Possibly recognizing good food or visiting restaurants in general just isn't your thing. Something might be wrong with your taste buds, something might be wrong with you as a person if you can't be a good customer.  

To Backyard Taco - Keep doing what you're doing,  you're killing it!"}
{"text":"Food was OK, service was sub-par, the staff seemed unhappy to be there, the seating was not wiped down and seemed messier than it should be for not that high volume of service. Disappointed because I have heard such great things. Probably will not come back to this location again. Maybe will try a different location in the valley."}
{"text":"Best tortillas in town tast like it is straight from Mexico also have great green sauce and hot sauces"}
{"text":"This went above and beyond our expectations. Visiting from NC and decided to go because of the great reviews. The meat was amazing and the service great! Love they stick to doing what they do best because it is sooooo yummy. Can't go wrong coming here."}
{"text":"Best street tacos I've had in AZ!! It's worth the wait and squeezing through the lunch time rush. Facility is clean. Parking is a little tight during the busy hours but again worth it for the food. Salsa is also delicious."}
{"text":"Overpriced, lackluster food. Typical trendy east valley restaurant that knows how to market to the masses but delivers nothing of substance. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I love backyard taco. Even though it is far for me, it is awesome and worth the drive. I love the open kitchen, the huge grill, and all the workers just making it happen. 

I usually get anything with steak. Steak tacos are money and so is the steak burrito. Man it's so filling that burrito. It is all simple, clean, and quick. They know how to do Mexican food. 

The salsa bar is pretty money. I'm not sure if they are their own recipes or ordered somewhere, either way it's awesome. The pickled red onion is one my favorites and the cucumber. The green salsa and pico are my go to. 

Taco Tuesday is the play. They have discounts on tacos during Tuesday from 2-10. For about 3 adults and 2 kids we order about 15-20 tacos and are straight. I usually eat 5 myself. 

If you want amazing tacos and one of the best in the valley go here"}
{"text":"I like this place even though I am a vegetarian and they have super limited choices. Bean burritos, veggie potato and plain cheese quesadilla pretty much it. The salsa bar is great though. That place gets packed around lunch time so I usually park off to the side. I think a lot of the girls that work there are big bitches but it is what it is."}
{"text":"It was Taco Tuesday evening, and we opted to drive to Mesa to experience for ourselves what the big deal was about this place.

When we arrived, parking was non-existent at the main driveway. Therefore, we had to park at the strip mall across the street. Crossing that little street was like the old Coin-Op video game \"Frogger\" due to the number of crazy drivers pulling in and out of the this establishment. 

People were cccrrraaaazzzzyyy to come eat at this place! This was a good sign. When we finally made it across the street, there was a line that wrapped around the front of the building. Another good sign!

However, it was disappointing after that. We both ordered the same meals so that we could compare notes.

Both our taco meats were actually slightly burnt, to a point that they had lost their flavor, unless you like the flavor of charred meat. On top of that, our Carne Asada burritos were so soggy that they seeped and broke through the hole in the tortillas. We actually had to eat it on the plate because it had become impossible to hold in our hands.

I am fairly sure that with so many positive reviews from Yelpers that I know and respect, that this was simply a Taco Tuesday anomaly. And that this place actually does serve a good product, albeit not entirely consistently!"}
{"text":"THE BEST Street tacos I have had in Arizona after eating Mex here for 15+ years.... Reminds me of being in Cozumel and San Carlos....genuine street tacos.......Meat is moist, and Mesquite flavored just enough. Salsas there are excellent too from a mild pico to their green which has a bite......Refried beans are perfect too.....I will be going back, Taco Tuesdays are a wicked good deal."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my food last night at backyard taco. The steak on my steak tacos had a great flavor and the salsa bar was amazing. The line was out the door when I arrived but it moved quickly and my food was ready in no time. Will definitely be making regular visits here to satisfy my cravings for good Mexican food."}
{"text":"Some of the best carne asada around! Great prices and friendly staff. This is my go to lunch spot when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"pretty good.  they need buritos!"}
{"text":"We get BYT at work a few times a month, always happy, never once disappointed. The carne asada is legit! Amazing tacos and burritos, you just can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Good Mexican Food. Great carne asada tacos. The only down side is that it seems to crowded at times . Best times to eat there are early afternoons."}
{"text":"This is without a doubt, the best taco stand in Mesa and possibly the entire Valley. I highly recommend it. The service is great, tacos and salsa bar authentic, and atmosphere is cool. I've been to Mexico a lot, and this Backyard Taco is every bit as good as anywhere there."}
{"text":"I heard great thing about this place, went two times with the same result, I ordered two carne asada, bit into taco...nothing but large chunks of fat. Was not impressed"}
{"text":"1st time here came to get some tacos and the owner was on the register his name is Ruben he gave the best customer service I have never seen someone so nice!!!? I received my tacos a few minutes later and they were the best I had! I would love for everyone to experience this customer service and this taco house! Hands down they are the best!!!!"}
{"text":"I love going here for Taco Tuesday!! Their menu is simple and amazing. The street tacos are really fresh and taste very authentic. And don't get me started about their horchata - it's some of the best I've had. 

This is a great, affordable place to grab some authentic and delicious tacos, or other Mexican fare. Don't miss out on their homemade drinks!"}
{"text":"The quality of the food and service here is very consistent, though always busy. I am not much of a fan of the standard American-Mexican food joints all over the valley, but this place gets me dreaming about going back."}
{"text":"Delicious and not too pricey. Although it is hard to find a seat at lunchtime. Chicken is moist and flavorful, beef has the wonderful charcoal flavor."}
{"text":"Place is always packed which is a good thing. But the set up to get to the salsa bar is terrible. I sometimes do not choose to eat here simply bc I do not want to deal with the claustrophobic atmosphere. Their tacos are good, but sometimes the meat is chewy and dry. Their tortillas and beans are super delicious. Priced decently and the familyntaco pack is a good buy."}
{"text":"When I am feeling lazy and do not want to put in the effort to make tacos... This is the place to go.

The flavors are wonderful, nothing like carne asada cooked over an open flame, right in front you!! 

Quality. Haven't had a bad experience"}
{"text":"Best tacos around!  Finally had to wait long enough for their grand opening to die down.  Waited one day for nearly an hour for our food, but it was worth it.  Everything was made just the way we ordered it.  Love the finishing bar where they have a great stock of salsas, pico, and toppings for the tacos.  One of our favorite places to stop for lunch or dinner.  Got the potato last time.  It was interesting to say the least!  Everything was mushed up inside the potato, but it did taste really good.  Didn't really like the fact that everything stuck to the foil wrapper.  Be careful when you eat it, as not to bite into a piece of foil."}
{"text":"First time here.  I know it's new in town as we had to wait about forty-five minutes from start to finish to get our food.  Food was very good, though.  Loved the salsa/fixings bar.  It was fun to try the different salsa options.  Ordered the bean and cheese burrito and the burria taco.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"The location was very busy could barely able to find a seat. The tacos were great! I was a bit disappointed they didn't have rice, our sons favorite. Everything had a smoke flavor, not my favorite in Mexican food."}
{"text":"Very yummy and because of that it's very busy. It's also very tiny making it difficult to stand in line, find a place to sit and eat and even hard to find a parking spot."}
{"text":"The food was OK. The service was a bit slow. I heard it was a great place for authentic tacos. Not the best I have had."}
{"text":"Food was alright. Food was on the smaller side. Tables were dirty. Have had much better food and portions elsewhere."}
{"text":"Tried this new place on a whim but really wasn't impressed. It was incredibly busy which is usually a good thing and means it's worth the wait, but it proved to be very inconvenient to find a place to sit. The menu wasn't quite as large as I was expecting and to be honest the food wasn't all that great, rather bland and incredibly messy to eat. The one thing I did enjoy was the avocado sauce usually found at authentic Mexican restaurants, but that was all. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"We went for the first time tonight. The food was great! The place was really busy, and the parking lot was pretty tight. Overall, good experience. Just need more parking. More explanation on their menus would be helpful as well. We had to ask a lot of questions to clarify what some things were and what came on everything. We will definitely go back though!"}
{"text":"Our gym is located just down the street from the place, and we have been watching the hard work they have been putting into building the place and making what was once an eye sore to a wonderful and clean looking establishment. When my husband and I finally noticed the place we had watched develop was open for customers we were excited. We often do not go out to eat, we would rather eat in, but we had to try this place, maybe because we were super excited, and made it out to be more in our minds, but on the day we went in, it was one disapointment after another :(. I will give the place on how clean and nice it looks 5 stars, but the salsa..although freash, it lacked flavor and most of them were so hot you couldnt even taste your food over the heat in your mouth :( The meat (beef) was so greasy and lacked flavor that unless you put a tons of lime on it, it was very unenjoyable to eat :( The price was high, and the portions small, and the chips and salsa, I belive, are the same chips I could buy from the local market :( Also we could not find one napkin in the whole place, and the service, although kind, was very unorganized. We do not want to be 100% negative, again, we give the owners 5 stars for making an establishment look so wonderful in Mesa that was once an eye sore, but wish that more money would go into less grease and more flavor all around:) -two mesa people :)"}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican food places in mesa.  You walk in and smell the mesquite wood that they use to cook with.  I always call ahead and the food is ready within 5 minutes.  The salsa bar is always stocked with fresh sides.  Go try it...you'll be hooked."}
{"text":"Tonight was not a good day to go to Backyard tacos. I always spoke highly of there food but today they lack the most important thing that makes business run great, customer services. There was a large crowd and not enough space for everyone. It is much colder these days and nobody wanted to sit or wait outside for there food. There was line to order and a line for the condiments. I went with the intentions to eat there but instead, I order to go. I noticed my receipt that my order was incorrect and spoke with the cashier. I explained my order, one plate with 1 carne asada taco and 1 birria taco, second plate 2 birria taco and 1 carne asada, third plate 2 birria tacos, 1 carne asada quesadilla and side grill onions. I was missing a birria taco and paid the difference. Which, I had no problem paying but I didn't know the order was canceled and removed from there screen with displays the orders. I waited patiently and noticed many others people getting there orders that order after me. My order was number 52 and they were calling out 59. I asked them about my order. I had to explained once again what my order was and showed her the receipt. She told me that the order was removed. I told her I never got my food. I am still waiting. They've talk with themselves and told me there working on my order. I was getting annoyed by then. She handed me the order and told me everything is in there but is not separate. I gave her a look of this disbelief and unsatisfied through all that waited time. I told her, \"if I was to eat here, you wouldn't have given me my order all incorrectly.\" I wanted them to place the order Accordingly to how I originally order it. Not 5 birria tacos one plate and 2 carne asada another plate and a carne asada quesadilla.  She then tried to explain cashier is new, I interrupted her and told her it wasn't her who took my original order. she's the one who fix my order and I seen her multiple times before. Another cashier was the one who messed up the order in the first place. Then she try to tell me that they always place everything together that's how they do it. Once again, I told her if I was to eat here and I asked for one plate of 2 items and my mom wanted a different plate of another food item, you would not combined them all together would you? So why is my ordered any different from anyone else that is eating here? Also, the fact the order was wrong and then they completely forgot my order....which made it even more annoying.....excuses after excuses. When I asked to speak with the manager, she said she was the manager. Didn't get no names because they don't tell you when you asked them and they don't have any name tags to identify themselves. She turned and look at another girl which she said, \"you got your food what else do you want?\" At that point I became upset.... what I wanted was an apology and fix my order, is all I wanted but they couldn't even give me that! All they keep coming up with dumb shitty excuses. Oh by the way, they still messed up my order when I got home. They forgot to give me a side grilled onions. Have they fixed my order like I requested they would've saw there was something missing. Never eating here again with there shitty customer service. I rather go somewhere"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place after watching it get built near a friend's house.  Unfortunately I was not satisfied..... Let me just say that the tacos are the bad version of white people tacos. Meaning, not like authentic tacos and a white person on a bad day could make a better taco.  I ordered two chicken tacos, kinda on pricy side at about $7.  Dry chicken, with unidentified green topping... Maybe it was lettuce.. but it had the texture of rice or a mutant cousin of quinoa.  The topping bar was ok-ish , but the guacamole was runny and looked like slime.


Lesson learned. I should have known better by all the patrons flawking here in mom jeans.....

BTW. This is not a racist rant,. I am white and I know we could do better tacos than this."}
{"text":"This is by far the best tacos in all of Arizona. Quite possibly the best tacos in the entire Southwest. They're always packed always busy."}
{"text":"We love this place a taste of some real authentic mexican street tacos!!"}
{"text":"I have been to Backyard Taco after my first review numerous time. It has now become my go to taco place especially for shredded meat. The consistency, quality of food and delicious taste keep us coming time and time again. I have recently tried their crazy baked potato and it was just as delicious.I usually go for the vegetarian one and I'm always tempted to try the one with meats but I have not yet. I also always order Jamaica which is my favorite drink. So cool and refreshing, I just love the flavor. 

The atmosphere here is very casual. I have come here during the day, at night, afternoon, it's always busy and buzzing with people. Prices are pretty average. Their menu options are pretty good but I always order the exact same thing which is Birria because I just absolutely love it. It's always juicy and tasty, I have not been there a single time and wasn't happy when I left. They do not serve any seafood items, so keep that in mind if you're interested in fish or shrimp tacos. 

I have come across their new Gilbert branch once. It looked really nice on the outside, very different from this location which is the original branch. Due to distance, this will probably always be my favorite location."}
{"text":"Quick update, I was not able to finish the family pack by myself.
I got about 7 taco's in."}
{"text":"Great tacos!! The chicken is amazing!! My fil request to eat here every time he visits."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and good food. But it's fairly run of the mill. Not as fantastic as everyone says it. It's moving away from its hole in the wall status that I prefer"}
{"text":"Was good. Kinda expensive though and not really authentic, more commercial. I'm more street taco truck type of person."}
{"text":"Loved it! Everything was super tastes and reasonably priced. GET THE POTATOES! Get them. Seriously. Salsa is so fresh and tastes like you would not believe. Clean and friendly atmosphere. Friendly staff. I would give 5 stars in a heart beat, except they use styrofoam plates. That was a huge bummer for me. If they switched to earth friendly compostable plates and utensils then I would change my review.

Hey backyard taco, can you look in to making your awesome business more earth friendly?"}
{"text":"Went for Taco Tuesday and had 4 carne asada tacos and a \"Mexican Coke.\" Amazing food and good prices. My friends tried some different items off the menu and everyone was pleased. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"May have come on an off night or something because we heard so many great things about this place but we were just not that impressed. Tacos were ok, but in my travels and even around the valley I've had way better. Service was friendly but place is small and was super busy. We would try it again probably on a less busy night."}
{"text":"Excellent grilled steak  and chicken tacos! The condiment buffet has something to satisfy everyone's palette, too. Next on the list to try is the
Potato!"}
{"text":"I had the Beef Carne Burrito. The meat had such a nice mesquite flavor, combined with the other fresh ingredients , that no salsa was even needed. This was probably the best burrito I have ever had and at $6-7 the price was a bargain."}
{"text":"We went on a Friday night, about 1/2 the tables were filled. We ordered chips and salsa, 4 taco's and a drink and our bill was about $20. The food took a really long time, the chips were mostly broken and the salsa for the chips was way too limey. 
The taco's tasted okay but for $2 each, I expected them to be larger, these are the street taco size. We sat outside since it was hot inside, regardless of where you sit, it's loud. It's either noisy from the kitchen or noisy from the busy road traffic. 
We were still hungry when we left but didn't want to wait another 20 minutes for another taco or two. So overall for us this place was meh, I probably wouldn't go back just because our visit wasn't all that enjoyable."}
{"text":"Tacos are very flavorful however their salsas have no flavor. I love putting salsas on my tacos so that was disappointing. The ambience in the restaurant is nice and open and the restaurant was very clean."}
{"text":"Really good tacos here. I like to go for Taco Tuesdays! $1.25 per taco from 2-10pm every Tuesday. Great deal. I normally prefer steak/carne asada to chicken at taco joints but at Backyard Tacos, I enjoy them both. I like that you can choose between corn or flour tortillas, also. 

The Papa Locos are good also. It's basically a baked potato topped with meat of your choice, shredded cabbage, pico & salsa. Its pretty awesome. 

They have a variety of salsas here. I can't ever remember which one I like so I always take home one of each of the 4 offered. I know one is spicy as hell. Way too spicy for me but my BF likes it. I think it's the green one if I recall. 

Only con is that its pretty dang small. There's barely any standing room while you're waiting for your order. I constantly have to maneuver around people while waiting because you're either blocking the trash can, the door or the salsa bar. Fortunately the food is ready pretty quick so it's not too bad."}
{"text":"by far the best tacos in town. always busy, like any place that has good food."}
{"text":"That place was awesome!  I was looking for a new Mexican food joint to try in the Tempe area.  The reviews talked me into making the drive east!  It was well worth the short drive.  Carne Asada was done right, it was chopped up very small.  Not large chunks that make it hard to chew. Resturant was very clean and friendly staff!  I look forward to re-visiting already, keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Great taco and of course the papa loca. Everyone is friendly here. The salsa bar offers the ability to make your taco even tastier. Don't be put off by the crowd. The line moves quick."}
{"text":"The food is typically pretty good with the exception of the chicken which tends to have a lot of fat on it and can be greasy. The salsa bar is suspect when it comes to cleanliness. But what's most annoying about this location is the slowness of the drive through and horrible parking situation. At 6 PM on any given night, expect to spend 20 minutes sitting in the drive through only to get your burritos unlabeled hoping they are correct. It's unlikely you snag a parking spot and if you do it's like a Rubik's cube parking lot."}
{"text":"Simple and delicious like a good taco joint should be. Pretty fast too despite the long lines."}
{"text":"Best Carne Asada Tacos! I love their salsa bar options too! Super busy and there was a wait but it was worth it."}
{"text":"flame grilled meat, on point, all fresh. best tacos i have every had, there  salsa is really yummy.  they are always packed, only downfall there not open on sundays. i refer anyone who asks me a great taco place in east valley."}
{"text":"Really good food, done right and fast. Definitely a crowd pleaser at my house!

There isn't anything on the menu that isn't good, but for my tastes the grilled chicken is the best: the marinade they use over the open grill is just fantastic.

The usual order for my wife and I is a couple of tacos (they're small street tacos) and the Papa Loca (Crazy Potatoes) with whichever meat you like: It's like a combination of mashed and baked potatoes done on the giant grill in a foil pouch, with cheese and finely minced veggies added. Amazing! The quesadillas, burritos and gorditas are also very good.

A note: It's all about take-out here...I've never eaten in, and there is often a line, but it goes pretty fast.

It's also popular with the locals: I've run into the Mayor of Mesa and City Council members, Church Leaders, and City Employees (Fire/Police, etc.)"}
{"text":"Best tacos I have found in Mesa so far.  This place is what a taqueria should always be, clean, nicely decorated and above all, great quality food.  5s all the way."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Street tacos, quesadillas, crazy potato.  Salsa bar has a great variety of salsas, all tasty, and some very spicy (which I love!).  Love the grilled onions and jalapeno!  Super friendly staff.  Quick service.  Loyalty punchcard.  Great location.  (Has a PokeStop, for the Pokemon Go players!)  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Where do I start great food friendly staff the crowd was a little bitchy service was fast who I think was the owner was friendly and informative must go"}
{"text":"So delish! Check them out, they offer a simple menu of tacos, quesadillas, gorditas, tortas, and their signature is the Papa Loca. They offer the party pack too which is awesome for entertaining. Very cool concept, they have renovated an old business and it is nice to see when that happens. 

Apparently the owners were cooking and selling food out of their backyard and every Friday night the line would stretch down the street to just order some of their tacos. Someone discovered this, and helped them get their own restaurant going."}
{"text":"Best tacos! I come back to this place when I'm looking for good quality meat! I always get the carne asada! Also got a cheese quesadilla to munch on and the cheese they use is also really good. Until next time taco Tuesday :)"}
{"text":"I ordered a steak taco, chicken taco and quesadilla. I expected to be blown away by the food, but the taco meet was pretty dry. Not sure if it's because the staff was still getting trained or it was an off day. 

The quesadilla was pretty good, nice flavor, but the meat was dry. I love the salsa bar, runny guac is delicious and the pico is fantastic. I will give it a shot in the next few months and see if the food improves (and the line gets shorter)."}
{"text":"Really good, inexpensive Mexican food.  We typically get the family platter of meat to make tacos plus an extra quesadilla.  Very authentic food - plentiful and fresh.  They have a little salsa bar where you can get guacamole but, it's a strange guac - it's very liquidy as opposed to thick and chunky.  It tastes ok but, I like traditional guacamole.  

My only complaint is the lack of seating and the insane fly problem.  No matter what time of year you go, the flies are everywhere.  We never stay to eat because of the flies."}
{"text":"Who wants really good carne asada? You know that thin, marinated, juicy meat with a smoky flavor having just come off the grill. When you're not cooking it up in your own backyard, you should come check this place out. 

I came here with Erin S. on the second day of the grand opening week. The VIBE was sort of that modern fast casual feeling with rustic touches. The space is quite large and boasts a sizable patio. 

The FOOD was delicious. I ordered the carne asada burrito and it filled me up good. The meat is succulent and tender, not chewy. Some other places you have to beware of those bites of carne that could go on for days. They deliver a good size burrito that's packed with mostly meat along with cabbage, onions, and red tomato sauce. This goes the same for the tacos which I can imagine are just as yummy. We ordered a side of frijoles (beans) which were tasty but not particularly remarkable. I intend to come by to check out the chicken and birria (shredded beef). I heard many good things about these other options while waiting in line, but a man only has one stomach. 

Take your pick from the MENU:
- Tacos
- Quesadillas
- Crazy Potato
- Grilled Gordita
- Grilled Tostada
- Burritos
- Chips and Salsa

They also offer a nice selection of Mexican bottled sodas, horchata, limonada, and jaimaca. 

The WAIT was bad - almost an hour. I chalk this one up to the fact the location just opened and they're working out the kinks. The volume of customers had to be slowing them down too. So, I'll give it some time before I return. Hopefully, they will have the drive-thru working by then!"}
{"text":"This authentic Mexican food place is amazing. They really grab your attention when at your first time checking in, you can get free chips and salsa. Following that, a stamp card for free food after 10 meals. And if that wasn't enough, they give you free tacos for your next meal here. As a college student who has to watch money, this place is perfect. Portions are large, and very affordable. On to the food, AMAZING. the flavor combination was so good. The grilled chicken (in the crazy potato and the burrito) had this smoky flavor to it. And nothing was over powering. Highly recommend the chips and salsa. And the limonada!"}
{"text":"Backyard say it all more clueless people working here with fully burned meat! Anyone can burn meat but can the cook NO! Amazing that Taco is in their name and they can't even get that right. I don't even think this is Mexican food even though everyone is clearly Mexican working there. Perhaps the should visit Mexico to learn how to make a real taco. 100% Thumbs Down."}
{"text":"This place is SO good! The overall food definitely deserves 5 stars. I had the chicken burrito and it was one of the best I've ever had. The chicken is seasoned and charbroiled and the cabbage, tomato sauce, and sour cream all taste so fresh. I loved it so much the first time, I had to eat it again the following day. 
The chips are great, but I didn't love the salsa that came with them. That was just fine, because their salsa bar is a huge plus. I especially loved the pico de gallo and some of their other salsas. Although the food is damn good, there were some things that made the overall experience less than awesome. First all, if you're dining in...expect pure chaos while ordering, waiting for your food and a seat, and using the salsa bar. It's usually so busy that we order take out. Some of the girls that work there mess up the orders pretty well. I've had my orders messed up on the twice now. 
Even with all that being said, it's not enough from deterring me to eat from here. I crave their burritos and tacos."}
{"text":"Raised in MX border for the majority of my childhood, I grew up eating tacos and all kinds of mexican food whether it be home cooked or just food stands. I can count in one hand the restaurants that serve tacos that hit closest to home and this is one of them. My favorite item is the Vampiro, I order two mimimum when I go but everything else is just as delicious. I live in Phoenix/Tempe so this place is quite the drive for me but very well worth it."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of my favorite street tacos in Mexico. However it's brick and mortar, clean and got a lot of variety. For less than $2 you can get a small taco that is packed with flavor. 
I've seen my Facebook friends eating here a lot so I thought if give it a try. I ordered two steak and two chicken. You can see the meat on the mesquite grill right behind the counter. I loved that the steak was medium instead of well. The chicken was also very juicy. 
I washed it all down with a mexi-coke. Shame that sugar mexi-cokes are going away. 
Give this place a try. You won't regret it. I can't make it to Rocky Point every weekend. This place is a fine substitute. I'll be comin back with friends and family."}
{"text":"Omg what a great find! I had the baked potato and it was amazing! Staff was very nice and knew their stuff!"}
{"text":"I really liked their tacos, both the chicken and carne asada with the chicken being my favorite. The only problem: I found a hair in my taco. I am blonde, the hair was black and curly. So I had to dock a star (normally it'd be -10 stars for that but I am feeling generous because I did enjoy the salsa bar). 

If you ignore that aspect though, good food! Worth a little wait."}
{"text":"Tacos, but not tacos!  My son lives nearby and insisted we go to lunch here--what a great son!  It had an eclectic feel and I thought I would get some good old fashioned tacos, like the tacos you would eat while sitting in a red Naugahyde booth.  No booths, no red naugahyde, just excellent food.  The chips and salsa were exceptional and the tacos...it was like eating tacos, but so much more.  I finished my chicken and beef tacos only to remember they were tacos.  I will be visiting my son more often now--good Dad!"}
{"text":"True authenticate Mexican food.  The way it should be with lime and salt.  They have a salsa bar with guacamole, 3 flavors of salsa, limes, and other stuff. 

Has an area to sit outside or inside and free chips and salsa with yelp check in. 

Definitely a place you should try if your in or close to mesa. I'll be taking myself and family back soon."}
{"text":"Update to my first review below- This place has figured out their issues it seems and has been awesome and timely the last few times we visited. Way to go guys! Food is better now also and staff is super friendly. 

Waited over an HOUR for food. Super slow! Once you actually get the food it's good but not great and definitely not worth waiting an hour for. This makes me so bummed because it's right in our neighborhood. I wanted so badly for it to have great food & service. Hopefully they get it figured out."}
{"text":"Discovered this place at my son's school carnival! Not only do I love local businesses that are involved in the community, but man do they make a good taco! It's so simple yet so delicious! We tried them out at their place and it's got a great local vibe as well. Definitely found my new taco shop."}
{"text":"04.12.17 Update: Three price increases since opening, but service and quantity of food for the money isn't keeping up. Change from $ to $$ category."}
{"text":"My favorite place to get a great street tacos. Family tradition after seeing Christmas lights. Tacos are amazing, but those potatoes are to die for too!"}
{"text":"We were SO excited when Backyard Taco was being built, since it was so close to our house. Walking distance! The restaurant is clean, service is good, but they have three things missing. No vegetarian options (their bean burritos are made with lard) and they don't serve beer. No tacos and beer? Bummer! They are also closed on Sunday's :("}
{"text":"I just went here last night for the first time. So impressed! It's so authentic and looks clean and delicious. The service was nice and efficient. They answered all my questions about the menu(I have quite a few). I ordered the Crazy potato and my boyfriend got the steak quesadilla and a steak taco. The crazy potato came with a choice of meat, I chose carne Asada. It was nothing like anything I have had before. Me and my boyfriend agreed, So delicious! 10/10 recommend coming for that potato because it is Unique and so damn good.
BUT I have to say I feel it is a little expensive for the burritos cause they are really just meat but that's just me. 
Over all go try the Crazy Potato!"}
{"text":"Great asada. I really love their flavor profiles. It's a small menu, but what they do, they do well."}
{"text":"Love!!! Not very authentic and limited menu items, but so delicious. Their carne asada tostadas are the bomb."}
{"text":"Went for Taco Tuesday with the family and it was so yummy!  The staff was very friendly. Great for a casual quick dinner"}
{"text":"The charm of Mesa is that with one leisurely jaunt down to a just about any street corner - you can cash your paycheck, pawn a few items from your grandmother's estate, and/or grab some pretty decent cheap mexican food.  So in that sense - BT is really nothing special.  Good, cheap, and authentic hole-in-the-walls are on almost every corner in these parts.  But for some reason the gringos and their BMWs keep rolling in here and acting as if you need to go out of your way to find a decent taco in Mesa.  I disagree.

The meat here is literally diced to the point of being mince.  Flavorful - but the tiny bits are overly diced and thus are kind of like eating pebbles of well-spiced beef.  We had our tacos wrapped in mini flour tortillas - the tortillas were a bit stale/stiff - not great.

The best part of BT is their salsa bar, which includes sliced cucumbers and pickled onions - though their pico and salsas were pretty ordinary.  Small but nice patio plus a few large picnic tables alongside the parking lot.  Overall 3.5 stars.  Come if you like safety in numbers - as this place seemingly is always busy.  Free chips for YELP check-in and note Taco Tuesday does not start until 2:00 pm here..."}
{"text":"I just can't stop coming back to Backyard Taco. Being from Southern California, I have authentic Mexican food at my fingertips. So whether it's a local spot, relatives, or friends - I've been taught what the best is.

Now let me tell you, this place is the best. I'm comfortable here. I'm welcomed here. I enjoy it here.

The employees are always great with my substitutions on my orders (yes, I'm picky) given the ever-growing line they never don't have. That's kind of a big deal for me... That being said, my service is always quick but never lacking. By the time I make it through loading up on salsa at the SALSA BAR, my food is up!

So get on over to Backyard Taco. Or don't... there will be more for me then!"}
{"text":"Ok,  so if you're a stuffed shirt who is worried about how many beans are in a calorie ... please go away so the rest of us can enjoy this hidden gem!  This place is not fancy, just good. Sit inside or out for a friendly, cozy atmosphere. 

I am a lover of carne asada. Congrats Backyard Taco, you nailed it! The corn tortilla carne asada taco is where it's at. The salsa bar is filled with awesomeness. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I've been to this Gilbert location about a dozen times now, and feel that I can give a fair review. The parking is hit or miss. They share the lot with a few other businesses, so that plays a part in not having too many available spots. The service and the food are both wonderful. My second time there was an error in my order, but it was promptly rectified, and super tasty! You're always greeted upon entry. There's a great salsa bar and even Mexican coke and Fanta! I mean, we talking full on authentic here. This location is nicer than its Mesa brother, from what I hear, but the food is just as Mexican as if we were south of the border. We finally are getting some good food spots in Gilbert! Taco Tuesday offers discounted prices on the tacos and there's even a stamp card that gives you $5 off you next purchase once filled up. I'm on my second card now. ;) Mary has helped me before, and she's always so pleasant and complimentary. Every interaction I've ever had with an employee of BYT has left me with a smile. Great job vetting and keep up the awesomeness!!!"}
{"text":"This place has the best tacos! They're as authentic as it gets. I don't know what they do to make their chicken and steak so good, but it's working! Yum!"}
{"text":"We love tacos..obsessed if you will. These are by far the best tacos in the valley.  New location is convenient (closer to home),  roomy and just awesome.  You can't go wrong here. The meat is amazing.  Real deal tacos al carbon."}
{"text":"Seriously, prob the best street taco in Phoenix.  I don't understand why other shop have not figured out that CABBAGE is better than lettuce....  I first experienced this in Puerto Penasco (Rocky Point).  Could not figure out why the tacos there were better.  It's the effing CABBAGE!  and that wonderful runny guacamole sauce.  I'm telling you, Backyard taco does it right!

That being said, I'm going 4 stars because at times the Carne Asada tends to be super greasy.  Like I got 3 of those bad boys and had to give the 3rd one to my friend.  The Pollo though, aww an, AMAZING!  

What pisses me off the most about Backyard Taco, the PRICE!  These kind of Tacos are not $2+ tacos.  I went on my first taco Tuesday and got 3 pollo 3 carne and spent $12  How the heck is that a Taco Tuesday deal man?  I was in Ahwatukee a month ago and Los Taquitos (aired on triple D) had tacos for $1 on taco Tuesday.  This used to be my fav tasting taco in Phoenix, until I tried Backyard.

Overall, yeah the food is bomb, I can't lie.  I guess today I will do a Yelp check in and get free chips n salsa to help make the price seem more worth it.  Easily a 5 Star if the price goes back down to the orig pricing."}
{"text":"Do not eat here. Went there this evening for the first time and was excited to see them cooking the meat over a fire. All downhill from there. I told the cashier it was my first time there so I wasn't sure about how things were done there..she just looked at me blankly. I ordered 2 quesadillas and a small beans to go. She asked me if I wanted everything  on it but when i asked what was on it she seemed annoyed. I then said no cabbage but yes onions and sauce. I was expecting a decent size for 4.25 but the container seemed small. Got home and only had one small, tasteless quesadilla with no cheese and no sauce. Just tasteless overcooked meat on a tiny tortilla. Called to find out if I could get money back for the missing quesadilla and was left on hold for 7 minutes. Called back and was told I would have to wait as people were ahead of me. Asked to speak to a manager and a few minutes later \"Danielle??\" came on the line. I told her the story. She said to get my money back i would need the receipt. I dropped it in the trash on my way out since who needs restaurant receipts. She said if I wanted to come back in...a 10 minute drive...she could give me some free chips and salsa. Go a few blocks further to Carolina's and get better portions, food and service."}
{"text":"Great place to find those Mexican Street Tacos!  Salsa is very good. The people waiting on you are friendly and helpful. Best place to go for a tasty quick affordable lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"At first bite I felt like I was in Mexico again. Carne asada is great. Also had Vampiro with Birria and that is my new addiction... the quesadillas are great and all the options at the salsa bar are amazing. Can't wait to make excuse to drive to a Mesa from the West side to eat another Carne Asada Taco!"}
{"text":"Great street tacos!  Carne Asada and Birria are my go to.  The only negative is how busy it can be, but definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"First visit to find out about this small but charming taco place. I had the Carne Asada (steak taco) and a chicken taco. I added the jalapena sauce on the chicken taco which raised it up to a new level of taste. I had a delicious Horchata to go with my lunch. My hubby had the Birria (shredded beef), which he enjoyed. The salsa bar had a fresh tomato salsa, sliced radishes, cucumbers, red onions, limes, a thin guacamole for the tacos and a couple of other salsa toppings. Our first visit was on Taco Tuesday during their special price hours from 2-10 PM. We sat outside as it was a pleasant day. The road noise is the one big down side to the whole atmosphere. The staff are very helpful and pleasant. I would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Our favorite taco place - we go here everytime we travel to Mesa from Orange County to see our family.  We actually go here first before going to my parents' house!"}
{"text":"Oh anytime our Employees are close to Backyard Taco a drop in for lunch is done. A good tip is always squeeze a lime on your taco! Very good food, service & smiles from staff!"}
{"text":"This is one of the better places to get tacos in Mesa. They have authentic flavors and do an awesome Taco Tuesday deal. 

The carne asada tacos are my favorite, but everything they serve is solid. 

Plus, they have the classic Mexican Cokes - the true sign of a good taco restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great place for quick tacos burritos quesadillas or gordita. Very good food. Not real big tacos but loaded with lots of meat. Not a very big place but quick service with great tasting food. Staff cleans tables in between customers quickly. So quick turnover.
Parking is limited. 
Really need a bigger place with more parking to serve more people this good stuff."}
{"text":"Amazing food! They have fire right in front of you with all the meat cooking. Loved all the sauces and the drinks too. The Horchata is delicious and a must try."}
{"text":"We got take out at Backyard Taco and I have to say I was very disappointed. I agree with TCU, the food portions are very small for the price charged. I ordered a carne asada quesadilla only it had no cheese on the tortilla, just a smear of green sauce and a little meat. We also ordered a stuffed carne asada gordita, the tortilla was hard and leathery and the filling seemed to be missing a lot of something. The carne asada was dry, dry, dry, tough and burned and flavorless.
Hopefully this is opening jitters and they will be able to work out the kinks and make this a great restaurant."}
{"text":"Backyard Taco is way overrated. Choose from any of the hundreds of other hole in the wall taco shops nearby for tacos that are both cheaper and tastier. If I'm going to pay over $2 for a street taco it had better be amazing and the carne asada tacos I got were dry and the al pastor just average. On top of that, they are always ridiculously busy. Not worth the price."}
{"text":"We both found hair in our food we have light hair and it was black. Parking is horrible. Food tasted not so great the Gordita's  where are harder than hard  like almost  chip your tooth..(truly) the quesadilla wasn't bad tasted a lot  fresher . It's a fast food place but was 1/2 hour wait ... I will say it's new,So will give it one more chance in a month or two. But as of yet so not impressed"}
{"text":"Honestly it's the best tacos I've tried since I moved here. Little back story on me. I moved to Arizona from LA this July and I grew up in Mexico so my standards are a bit high. I have to say these tacos are pretty good. The prices are a bit high but I think that's the norm here. In LA my favorite tacos were 75c...I had the carne asada and al pastor and they were both very good. The al pastor was a little sweet BUT I know the founders are from Mazatlán so the recipe it's probably influenced by that fact. I also loved the music! It brought back so many memories. Oh and the person who complained about the cabbage being chopped so fine obviously has no culture. I have tried tacos from literally 2 extremes of Mexico. I've had them in Baja where I'm from and in Yucatán and the fine cabbage is a thing. I will definitely come again and try the papa loca."}
{"text":"I was disappointed in my visit yesterday, the carne asada was extremely dry like if it was old and re heated in the grill multiple times. I been to the mesa location before and it was good almost like eating in Sonora. But I was disappointed, we ordered for 5 people tried gorditas, tacos quesadilla, and unfortunately the meat was the same .

I am not sure if its that the meat was old or who ever is grilling the meat had no idea what they were doing.

Hopefully you can fix this and we can give your location another shot since we live so close, thanks"}
{"text":"Great upscale tacos. I have only done the drive thru. However it has always been excellent service. The staff is friendly and always willing to make sure the right color salsa is given. If you get the chance, try the vampiro."}
{"text":"The absolute best tacos in the Phoenix metro, and I've been to many! I love their style of grilling, which is slow chargrilled over mesquite wood. When its finished they store the meet properly so it doesn't get soggy and overcooked.

Tacos are the best, the potato (mashed potatoes with your choice of meat) comes in second, then the burrito. All meats are good, but the al pastor is lacking and not the best in town (also a new selection to their menu). Carne asada and chicken are both very tender, moist and savory, with a good outer seared crust. The Birria is 100% moist and finely shredded - no dry bits at all - and is extremely FLAVORFUL. You have the option of flour or corn tortilla, but I always go corn on tacos. The staff are very accommodating as I only like single shells rather than 2. I love that these tacos are not oily, but still pack amazing flavors. You can request complementary grilled jalapeños and onions (a must for me).

There is a salsa and condiment bar for all of your needs. Not the most flavorful salsas, but it's perfect to compliment their food. I just hate where it's located, because functionally, it seems inefficient (especially when the restaurant is full, which happens all too often).

Lunch is usually pretty packed and weekend nights get packed as well. Parking lot is really small but you can park around the neighborhood and the nearby venue's parking lot.

Horchata tastes good as well."}
{"text":"This place does live up to the hype, I have to say. Nothing I've had here has been dud. My favorite meal at the moment is the Carne Asada Burrito and the flan. It's not diet food, but I could care less. I order ahead to avoid the line, and I ask for extra salsa on the side so I don't have to stand on that \"salsa triage\" line (there's always one person in that line who has to take a year trying a little of everything). The flan literally melts in your mouth. No complaints."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Mesa. Every single one is good but the Carne Asada and the Shredded beef take the cake. And that shredded beef has SO much flavor. On Tuesdays each taco is 1.79. What more do you need?"}
{"text":"Love this place!  The food is delish and the price is amazing!  It can get busy during lunch and dinner times.  Menu is bigger, now they have  burritos!  One of my favorite things is all the stuff they let you get for free on the side.  Cream guacamole, salsa, grilled onions and more. Make sure you check in before. Today they have a special for free salsa!  I will have to save it for next time."}
{"text":"I was extremely hungry and I saw the great reviews so decided to try them. I ordered shredded burrito  and tacos. My order got confused  but was still warm. Prices are fair and it was a good but sweet burrito . The flan was delicious and very good texture. It is extremely busy so if in a hurry call it in."}
{"text":"Love the food and the atmosphere. Highly recommended

Am about 15 minutes from both this and the Mesa location. This one is bigger and more open but that one has a slightly homier feel. Either way you'll not be disappointed"}
{"text":"Not sure how this place is getting 4 stars and good reviews.  The food was dry.  I know they just opened but the soda fountain was out of many choices.  I reported it but nothing was done to remedy.  I was excited to have a taco shop come to my neighborhood but I think I will continue to drive out of Gilbert for much better tacos, etc."}
{"text":"Just ok. I've had better carne at other places. It wasn't terrible, but for the price, I expected more. I also wish the had combination plates. It's all a la carte."}
{"text":"Wow! 
If you try one thing, make it have carne asada on it! MM mm Mm! Give the crazy potato a try, too! Fantastic stuff!

So we looked this place up on mouth-by-southwest and thought it sounded good. We were looking for late-night tacos on a Saturday night. Open til 11pm on Saturdays, we thought we'd give it a shot. Arrived at 9pm and this place is hoppin! We ordered one of each type of taco, some nachos, as well as a crazy potato w/ carne asada. Delicious! It's definitely worth the drive and the price is low for such delicious food. We will for sure come here again!"}
{"text":"With all of the hipster joints turning tacos into $5 affairs it is nice to find the old dives that serve them up right.... sizzling hot and cheap.  A solid spot that provides a great street taco experience."}
{"text":"Let's be real, this place has one of the yummiest tacos! From their salsa bar, to their mexican sodas, it was all a thumbs up and a must come back for me. The staff was NOT the nicest, but I can see past that. And it was also too bad that they don't serve alcohol, but for being a 'backyard' taco joint, it serves it purpose and can't wait to come back! Definitely try their chicken tacos, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Was honestly just meh or alright. I think it is expensive for the amount of food a person receives. The only menu item I enjoyed was the potato. It is different and can be loaded with meat, cheese, sour cream, guacamole, and/or salsa. They have a salsa buffet but it is extremely small and the line gets backed up rather quickly. The cashiers were not very friendly or fast. I don't know if I will be coming back there."}
{"text":"Very good carne asada tacos for AZ.  One of the closer ones compared to good tacos in Sonora, Mexico.  Will definitely be going back. Recommend putting the cabbage (repollo) out at the salsa/accessories bar and make it a little bigger and not minced.  Would be great if salsa bar was accessible from both sides too as gets crowded in the corner with others waiting for food and tables nearby.  Look at Ta Carbon in west Phoenix for their salsa bar set up."}
{"text":"Best tacos in the east valley! 
The cons of the place is the arrangement, the salsa bar is a nightmare, the very long wait to get your order and then to receive it, and good seating is practically next to impossible to find. 
Otherwise the food is great! 
I recommend it here to anyone who loves GOOD tacos. 
A little overpriced but relatively average for the area, although 100% worth it for the authentic street taco flavor. We haven't found a better spot even after hitting up the stand alone street taco vendors off broadway. 
Note;
Just stick to ordering tacos, I don't recommend the quesadillas they are very small and don't add much cheese or the burrito, the portion really doesn't justify the price."}
{"text":"Hands down best taco shop on the east valley get their carna sada tacos u can't go wrong. I love this place gone 3 or 4 times a no th they are always busy but it's worth the wait I usually get the carna taco and burrito best thing on there menu haven't tried The pork yet but my buddy said it was good so I will let u know when I go next and try it it would be a 5 star but tables are always dirty because of how busy they are"}
{"text":"(Reposted, because Yelp took my review off for some reason?) 

When i took the first bite of my Carne Asada Burrito, i found the heart to consist of nothing less than Mesquite grilled steak, bursting with flavor and awesomeness. Move aside, Fili's and Los Fav's, a NEW boss is in town. 

I am madly in love with mexican food to begin with, but the flavors emerging from my meal were far beyond my wildest dreams. . . and that says a lot! 

I am shocked that I have not eaten here before, being a Carne Asada Connoisseur, and the restaurant only being three miles from where I live! 

The food is top notch and tastes amazingly authentic, the atmosphere is pleasant and welcoming, and once you have one bite, there's no turning back. 

Did I mention the Pico? I have found the actual physical embodiment of Awesomesauce.

13/5 stars, but they would only let me put 5 up there, so that's where it'll have to be. Cheers, and Eat up."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the rave is about. The staff is unfriendly and anti-social. The wait to get your food is extremely long. The first cashier what very nice, but after that was not a good experience.

I want to the \"salsa bar\" and nothing was labeled so I had to ask what stuff was. The first girl looked at me like I was an idiot and I should know. She said one was guacamole; I've never seen it in a liquid form. It was good, but I wouldn't call it guacamole. I asked if they were always that busy and she said yes.

I get my food like 30 minutes later. The tacos were good; I wouldn't say they were $2.25 good. Who doesn't put cilantro and onions in a \"taco\"? Literally nothing there. Then I look at my sons quesadilla and there is literally NO cheese on that. I took it to the front and the next girl looked at me super pissed. I said \"hi, do these normally have more cheese?\" She grabbed it from me and took it to three different employees who all looked at me as if I should have my throat slit. Then another girl says \"if you want see your cheese, you need to ask for the cheese to be on top\". Not sure what that even means. She gives me another and literally the same if not, less cheese. 

The food flavor would give this place a 3-4, but man that service is so terrible I couldn't believe it. How does 75% of your staff look miserable? I might try again in a few weeks. It will have to be on a Tuesday(discounted tacos). Hope they work this stuff out. This is the only new food place we've gotten. 

If they reach out and I go back I'll update this review."}
{"text":"Wasnt impress with the portions for the price. Flavor was ok as well. Ive had better, so this will be the last time I eat here. Not worth the money. Dont recommend this place. Restaurant looks nice from the outside tho"}
{"text":"Great Food! Great Service! I really love this place and everything I have ordered has been good. I love places with a salsa bar. 4 out of 5 only because tacos aren't the best value if you go on a day besides Tuesday."}
{"text":"Simple, delicious street-fabulous tacos, burritos, and quesadillas. All served in a laid-back indoor small place...so get there early!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  Local and authentic...a hidden gem with good food a great location and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Omg such a sweet spot in Mesa for this taco stand!!! The carne asada was absolutely the bomb, next time I'm in the area I'm definitely gonna come here again."}
{"text":"I came back to the Phoenix area on my short trip with one very specific task in mind: to eat lots and lots of Mexican food. Backyard Tacos was one step on my journey to taco fulfillment and I primarily went based on reviews from yelp. Apparently this place started off as a tiny little taco shack that was literally based out of someone's backyard (or at least that's the urban legend I was fed). Somehow it expanded into a full sized fast food taco shop with a full (but small) menu. I was told that their tacos were the best in the valley and with a claim like that, I was convinced to challenge it. 

Sure enough, when I arrived at lunch time it was packed with a nice long line. I ordered 4 tacos with chips and salsa (which were free with a yelp check-in). I'm generally a carne asada guy do i got 3 of those and 1 of the birria tacos. The wait for my food was long after I placed my order and the staff seemed flustered and not too friendly. The salsa bar had its own long line which was mostly due to being poorly placed in the front corner.

Once my tacos arrived I sat outside along some counter seating (the only thing available). I immediately noticed a strong paint smell (from the counter, not the food) and found that my arms were coated with paint residue from the counter since they obviously didn't take time to put any form of sealant over the paint. It probably bothered me more than it should have so I tried to not let it distract me from the important part - the food.

I was impressed by the carne asada tacos. The meat was nicely flavored and tender. They were a bit small but the price wasn't terrible for what I got. The birria taco wasn't anything special but it was pretty good too. The offerings from the salsa bar were disappointing (I didn't love the flavors and found them relatively bland, especially the guac) but the tacos were good enough to stand on their own and I really only used the salsa for heat (the red salsa is quite smoking hot). My face was screaming for the rest of the day. The chips were good as well but the salsa that came with the chips was actually kind of gross so I ended up using stuff from the salsa bar instead.

Overall I definitely recommend this place but it is by no means the best tacos in the Phoenix valley. Better than Filibertos? No doubt."}
{"text":"I like the food. Nice small business success story and example of a revitalized commercial space.

Edit to add a star because, generally, the so-so customer service from some of the younger employees has improved.

There are some genuinely friendly, helpful, and hard-working employees here. Things are a bit hit-or-miss with some of them, but generally, it seems like things have improved compared to a few of my previous visits."}
{"text":"Found this place last year after business meeting - really good food and highly recommend"}
{"text":"Tried the Carne asada, pollo and birria tacos. All 3 were fantastic. But I favor the birria more since I love lamb meat. Nice salad bar. Quick service although wait times can be long depending on the time you are in, but quality is top notch as always. 
Friendly staff. I'm giving 5 stars for this wonderful experience."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed because I had been looking forward to trying this place.  I was already annoyed by the parking lot situation.  You basically have to fight to get a spot and I was there after 7pm.  I got a chicken quesadilla and seriously there was no cheese inside.  I pulled it apart and there's just chicken and cabbage in it. To top it off, the meat had gristle.  Not sure what the rage is all about with this joint.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"This place has great tacos, but it is small- so do't plan on eating here- just order it to go. When you order out you can ask for bigger cups for the salsa bar- so you aren't taking a half dozen little ones. The salsa bar line and the ordering line tend to merge into one due to the poor set up, so it is kind of a fiasco. The grill is right behind the registers, and it gets really hot in the small building. We have found that calling ahead is the only way to go - or you will be waiting in a blistering hot building sweating for the 20-30 minutes it takes to get your food.  
Also, be prepared to park down the sketchy neighborhood street and walk to the location. The parking lot is ity bity and this place is popular. 

This place is closed on Sundays which is really unfortunate, but it is a great place to get street tacos for lunch during the week."}
{"text":"My husband and l where introduced to the original location on University by our son. Needless to say, we love these tacos. We would drive the 20+minutes at least once a week to have them. When they built the Higley location, it's still about 20 minutes to get there, but for us all freeway. I don't know where those who have left a negative review have eaten at, but bar none these are awesome street tacos. It's fair to say my husband and l have eaten allot of Mexican food in our lifetime, not only in Az, but Texas and California. These are by far the best out there!! The restaurant is clean, well run and the food is always fresh and extremely flavorful! We absolutely will remain loyal customers to Backyard Taco as well as many of our family and friends we have taken there! Thank you to the managers and staff for maintaining good food and awesome customer service in the restaurant industry which is hard to come by these days."}
{"text":"The last three times I was there. The meat was greasy and hard. It tasted like it was the meat sitting at the bottom of the pot all day. Gross!! Now I eat at Two Hippies Beach Shack. Those are the best burritos and tacos in the Valley."}
{"text":"Nothin too fancy about it. Plain and simple good food. I got the carne asada burrito which was awesome and my wife got one of each of the 4 different types of tacos. Burrito was decent sized and delicious. We popped in there for dinner before a concert a ways from the house because it was nearby the show. Will definitely be visiting again any time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, the food was wonderful, I loved my crazy potato with carne asada meat. Really busy while we were here the whole time the line was moving superfast though. Everybody working here was in a great mood and super helpful. Overall it was an excellent experience and we will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I had some tacos (take out) with some friends, and they were delicious!! The carne asada was fantastic; the chicken wasn't as flavorful, and I wasn't crazy about the guacamole. But overall, everything else was great and I'll be back!"}
{"text":"What a find. Great street tacos. Reasonable prices. Loved the salsas. Fresh pico not the typical old tomato kind. The spicy one is very spicy exactly the level of spice I love. Carne asada is outstanding. I generally don't like chicken especially if its not white meat but the chicken isn't bad either. My review is if you love tacos this is a must try. And last they have great dietcoke.

I see my review didn't post and for some reason I had it at 4 stars.  I'm going to go again but I remember this being a 5 star place.  I can't think of any place that has better tacos."}
{"text":"I went to lunch here yesterday with a co-worker. During the ride I was reading some of the positive Yelp reviews. I must say that this place lived up to those reviews.

I had a chicken taco, steak taco, and steak quesadilla. They were all great. It was cool to walk in and see the pit going with the fresh steaks and chicken being cooked right behind the cashiers. I will warn you that you need to step to the side if you don't know what you want. They move fast and the line builds quickly. There is also limited seating here."}
{"text":"Right in between 3 and 4 stars. Lots of meat - you can see it when ordering I Wichita I could by the chicken from them and take it home for my own creations - a suggestion if mgt reads this!  You are showing the customer that anyway it could be profitable. You end up buying 3-4 tacos because they are those little ones . Guac is free sour cream is not. I think next time I'll try their baked potatoe thing - looks good."}
{"text":"Ive been eating at Backyard Taco since they were literally in the back yard.  Great food and great prices.  If you haven't tried it, you are truly missing out."}
{"text":"Where do I start? I was looking for a place to get a Carne Asada Burrito since there is no Filiberto's by my house. Yay, Backyard taco. Hear some good reviews so I thought I would try it. I get to the window and order my Carne Asada Burrito, Thinking this is great. The employee asks me if I want everything on it. Yes, yes I do. No onions if there are. Perfect. Get to the window and grab my order. The employee says 10.00. What? 10.00 dollars for a burrito? Ok, this better be the biggest bestest burrito I have ever had. Look in the bag ok. Good to go. Burrito is, in fact pretty big. Get home and pull this giant burrito out of the bag. Nice little Styrofoam plate included. Get a knife to cut it. I open it. Look, cool. Beans, rice, some Carne, and some pico. Fine, fine. Not what I was expecting but ok. Wish there was some guacamole or sour cream but I will survive. Now to the moment of truth. I bite into this big burrito like there is no tomorrow. What, is this? I'm chewing. Ok there is NO flavor. I kid you not, I felt like I was literally eating textures. It tasted like nothing. So plain. And boring. I was thoroughly disappointed. I ate half as I was very hungry and threw the rest away. So my conclusion. Either I have been way to Mexican and maybe my taste buds are off or this was the most Caucasion'ist burrito I have ever eaten in my life. Even worse than taco bell. Never again. I did give two stars for quick service but that is it."}
{"text":"2nd trip to backyard taco   not happy to wait one hour for what is considered fast food.  Will definitely re think my return.  Sorry.. !   You can't run a special and not be able to keep up with the demand"}
{"text":"THAT salsa! THOSE tacos! THIS could be a dangerous problem of yummy proportions! 

Challenge accepted! 

Someone give me a stamp card and lets get started on a beautiful journey covered in the salsa bar's guacamole with a twist of lime. BYT is simple food that is done impeccably well. And it is apparent by the hoards of loyal lunchtime business they do. 

THAT insanely large line moves fast and smooth! THOSE employees give beyond friendly with a smile service! THIS needs to be your next lunchtime meal! 

Bonus: Taco Tuesdays mean tacos are only $1.49 each!

So grab yourself the biggest cup of horchata I've ever seen, and accept the challenge that will have you hooked on BYT."}
{"text":"The only place in Mesa that serves the best fried gorditas de al pastor. So glad I found this gem."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!! What a great find. Prices are right and the food is superb. Just. Backyard cookout with carne asada. You can taste the char from the grill and the flavor of the meat. If you love tacos or simple, real Mexican food look no further. It's worth a drive too if you're in Scottsdale or Tempe."}
{"text":"YUMMY!  Very authentic, clean, fast, tasty, well-priced and the people always smiling....love this find...."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WORTH THE WAIT.

Backyard was absolutely fantastic. You walk in, place an order, and wait for your number to be called. From tacos to gorditas, there were plenty of options and lots of sizzling meat grilling right before your eyes. We both opted for carne asada on everything, and I added another pollo tostada to complete my meal. As you wait, you go and take over the sauce bar and fill your small containers with all the salsa, guac, or gallo you'd want.

Oh, and a Check-In on Yelp snags you complimentary chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Backyard Taco is THE PLACE for delicious fire grilled meats in their delicious authentic tacos, burritos etc, and the salsas are perfecto!  This is where all the locals go, so you know it is awesome!  Try this place, it will be one of your favs, it's mine :)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!! Everything is so fresh and delicious. There is always a line out the door. It is very small so most of the dining space is outdoors. They have a great salsa bar too!"}
{"text":"Definitley a fan and happy they are building another location in Gilbert.  That will make it easaier to get to!"}
{"text":"Good tacos but overpriced. Not too many tables to sit at. The place is small and it was packed at dinner time on taco tuesday.
We waited 20 min for our take out food.
The people working were not friendly and seemed to be under staffed.
The place looked clean.
Again, Good tacos. Not the best I've had and overpriced.
Will probably try them again because they are close, but not on taco tuesday."}
{"text":"Great customer service. Nice ambiance. Tried all the tacos. Liked the pastor the most. Least favorite was the shredded beef. Great tortillas and reasonable price. Come check it out!"}
{"text":"Great carne asada tacos! Lots of extra condiments. Meats are all seasoned & grilled on-site!"}
{"text":"Good tacos, when they're not busy. Otherwise, it's raw tortillas and overcooked meat. I prefer the flour tacos over the corn, the tortilla soaks up all of the juices! They have a yummy little salsa bar that I'm obsessed with. I come here every once in a while when I don't mind spending a little more on tacos."}
{"text":"I love love love Backyard Taco!! I've never had a potato at a taco stand but boy was I pleased to try it for the first time. The asada is juicy and the cabbage they top their street tacos with really makes them pop!"}
{"text":"Ordered a carne asado burro and a pollo asado burro to go.  Get home and the burros have beans and very little meat.  Not happy was excited to have asado.  I have never heard of asado burros with beans.  If I had wanted beans I would have ordered a bean burro!  Did you run out of meat or what?  Dont think I will be going back!"}
{"text":"Don't listen to the 3 star reviews. These are some of the best tacos in town. The grill is amazing and all the meat turns out pristine. The salsa is on point too. The restaurant is also clean and nice. Ya, there's a line sometimes but that's because it's legit. This place never disappoints. Come here once. Just come. You'll never stop."}
{"text":"Sorry Yelpers. I hate to rain on your parade, but meh...I didn't really find this place to be spectacular in any way. The restaurant was crowded which I expected, the service was ok at best. The food was mediocre. To me, this is an overrated hole in the wall that has somehow gotten really popular (power of suggestion maybe?). The entire restaurant struck me as unsanitary. The Salsa bar had a glass shield but seems unkept and overused. Most people there seemed like they were having a good time and enjoying themselves; I thought is was crowded, loud and disorganized. I would never suggest this place, or go back myself. Not terrible but absolutely nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"If you love street tacos, this is the place, no fish however. Very ample salsa bar with all the fixings to dress up your tacos. The guacamole sauce is excellent. The steak was my favorite and the tostadas are so crispy, really worth trying. Fast food style, good service, most seating is outdoors, a few tables indoor."}
{"text":"Food here is fantastic! My wife and I were excited to visit the new location of Backyard Taco! It definitely hit the spot! We ordered Chicken, Carne Asada, and the recently added Al Pastor Tacos. The taco size and quality are worth the price, these are not small tacos. They were all delicious! They have a salsa bar with cucumbers, pickled red onions, lime, etc. All the essentials you need to dress up your already tasty food. These are authentic made to order tacos grilled over mesquite. Don't mix this up with the wannabe fast food tacos that are already made and packaged so don't freak out if it doesn't come out in 20 seconds. This is the real deal, we always complete our order with a bottle coke and agua de jamaica. Neta la comida aqui es para chuparte los dedos. Must Try!"}
{"text":"The line was a little long but they're quick and it's worth the wait. We tried the steak taco, chicken taco, and cheese quesadilla. The food was delicious and salsa bar was a good bonus. Try the guacamole salsa!"}
{"text":"First time here on Taco Tuesday and They were delicious! Will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place and it did not disappoint! The quesedillas are AWESOME, authentic and not too much cheese. Crazy potato was delicious too but not a lot of food for the price. We did the drive through on a Saturday night and it was relatively quick considering it's not fast food. Great price overall and yummy drinks too. The patio looks adorable and large. Salsa was good. Skip the Gordita."}
{"text":"Awesome mesquite meats. The tacos, burritos and quesadillas are excellent. These guys move fast and the food is out quickly. Not a huge fan of the salsas they offer but everything else is on point."}
{"text":"Yummy!  We ordered the family dinner to go - 16 (small) tortillas, salsa and carne asada for $20 plus we added a side of beans. everything was delicious! Cute place, very clean! Simple decor, nice patio (I will sit there next time!) Service was quick! I really enjoyed it!  :)"}
{"text":"Long wait food was ok but not spectacular"}
{"text":"It was okay but the best tacos in the state is really pushing it. I had the carne Asda tacos and the seemed really dry. The cucumber were really fresh and the chips and salsa were pretty good but because I came for tacos I wasn't that satisfied. I doubt I'd ever go back even if in the area."}
{"text":"Love the papas loco with carne asada and the fresh salsa.  Carne asada tacos are good as well.  Small sitting area so get ready to stand to wait for a place to eat during the busy lunch and dinner times.  Other than that, good customer service and clean establishment."}
{"text":"Finally got here to see what the hype about. Nice location, lots of seating available especially with the size of the crowd. I ordered the carne asada burrito and my daughter had the stuffed quesadilla.  I was underwhelmed with my burrito. The meat was bland and after 2 bites, my burrito completely fell apart. Think I'll try the tacos next time."}
{"text":"Living in Gilbert you don't have much choice of real authentic Mexican food, so we had to take long drives into town to have some. I was told about this place (Backyard) took the family out there and let me tell you, this place is delicious. Good size tacos, the pappa loca is awesome too! Would recommend this place to any taco lover!"}
{"text":"Not as good as the original back yard taco in Mesa. The location is great though, very modern feel, it definitely was put in a great spot for the town of Gilbert. The food was not good though. I got one of each of their tacos, and my boyfriend did the same. The tacos were not good here. I mat give it a try again sometimes soon because maybe they were just having an off day but as of right now I will stick to the longer drive and go to the one in Mesa."}
{"text":"Nice little laid back place. Menu is simple and food Is good. Salsa bar. Meat is cooked right on the grill."}
{"text":"After reading all the positive comments about this place my wife and I decided recently to give it a try.  First, let me strongly recommend you get your food to go.  There are only a couple of interior tables, the rest are outside.  None of the tables appeared to have been recently cleaned.  But far worse than that was the flies.  It was like eating near a garbage dump.  You eat with one hand while waving the flies away with the other.  Not cool.
I had the carne tacos.  These are street tacos so they are small, about 1/3 the size of a restaurant taco.  I was expecting some very flavorful meat after watching it cook over the interior mesquite-fired grill.  If it weren't for the salsa on the meat it would have been flavorless.  The beef was chopped into tiny pieces, the bulk of which were very overcooked, dry, and leathery.  I would not order them again.  My wife had the chicken quesadilla and a chicken taco.  These were much better, although she had a hard time locating any cheese on the quesadilla. The chicken was a tad overcooked and not at all spicy, which is how my spouse prefers it.  If I ever went again I would order something with the chicken."}
{"text":"Everything is awesome!!!!
Try the crazy potato!   I honestly don't know which is better, the chicken or steak!  Call ahead if you can, the lines are always long!!"}
{"text":"Fast and tasty tacos! The potato was super hot and more \"creamy\" than I expected, assuming it was just a baked potato. Tacos were delicious, although I was surprised they were only available chicken or steak. I ordered a gordita, but somehow got a burrito (that is not even on the menu?!?) I kept it, but it was a big one and I was so full after that I really regretted not sending it back. Jamaica was great. The \"backyard\" is so cute, I woukd have probably loved it just for that, haha. But I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"We've been by this place a number of times since we live right by it and we finally decided to try it.  The family was starving and I was in the mood to try something new.  I ordered some chicken and beef tacos, chicken and beef tostadas, a cheese quesadilla, some chips/salsa, and flan to go.  It didn't take too long for the order.  It was probably in the 5-10 minute range.  

I took it all home and placed it on the table for everyone to dig in.  We pulled out the tacos and tostadas.  The meat was great!  Everyone agreed that the tacos were better than the tostadas.  The tostadas seemed to be a little on the crispy side.  The kids tore through the quesadilla so I'm assuming it was pretty good.  The chips and salsa were very good.  

They also give you a salsa bar to select different kinds of salsa which is very nice.  We sampled the different salsas and found them all to be very tasty.  

We all finished and it was time for dessert...the flan.  Wait, all the bags were open...where was the flan???  Well $&%@!!!!  They didn't give us the flan but they were nice enough to charge us for it.  I have to admit it was one of the pictures I saw here on yelp and it looked so good.  I was really looking forward to trying it.  I thought about going back and the kids wanted me to go back but it was late on a Monday night and I just wasn't feeling like going to argue for flan.  

I've been debating between giving this place a 3 or a 4.  I really liked the meat but I'm really pissed about the flan.  I finally decided to go ahead and give it a 4.  I did like the flavor of the meat and I will probably return for more tacos.  If you get takeout I would highly suggest giving your bag a couple of extra checks to make sure you aren't missing any items or you risk getting home and being disappointed."}
{"text":"Backyard Taco, you are nowhere near me, but I'm willing to make the long journey for your delicious Carne Asada!!!  Cooked over real mesquite for a perfect smoky blend of flavors.  The tacos are amazing, but I usually go for the burrito, as it is PACKED with tender, juicy, smoky steak!  In fact, typically, I ask for meat only and hold everything else that comes standard, it's that good on its own.

I guess back in the day, the owners started grilling their food for their family, friends and neighbors; and as word grew, people started following them to stranger's backyards just to get some of the delicious food off the grill.  I don't know if this story is true, but I don't doubt it!

The menu is limited and they obviously stick to what they know best, and it shows.  The restaurant interior is usuall packed with a long line that extends out the door; but don't fear, it usually goes by very quick.

Take the journey if you don't live in the area, you won't be disappointed, I promise!"}
{"text":"So yummy and authentic. I have been there several times and each time I'm please with my experience. The  food perfect the staff is always friendly and although there's a long line it moves along so fast you don't even feel like you're waiting"}
{"text":"Ok best new taco place in the neighborhood!!! Yes the line is long but totally worth it!! Would you want to go to a place where isn't  a line??? To all the haters........it's worth the wait!!! I loved the carne tacos and quesadillas!!!"}
{"text":"I've heard many things about this place.  finally close to one. Decided to try it out. And I must say damn good. I will definitely do my best to come back"}
{"text":"I like the Carne Asada. The place is consistent in quality and service. There's usually a crowd and limited seating but they keep things moving. It's not my fav place for Mexican food, but one we like to go to occasionally to mix things up. Love that they started in a backyard and built their business from there."}
{"text":"Don't let the name fool you. There is indoor seating. 
The chips and salsa are perfect companions to each other and to any meal. The best chips and salsa that I have had in years! 
The vegetarian crazy potatoes are my new comfort food."}
{"text":"Bought two chicken tacos wrapped in corn tortillas. I liked the finely shredded cabbage, which resembled rice, and the salsa bar filled in the missing flavors. The chicken was nicely seasoned and fresh.
Also purchased a side of salsa and chips. The salsa was a little different flavor and more of a liquid but the scattering of cilantro helped boost it. I will probably go back if I'm in the area because overall, the tacos are decent."}
{"text":"Disappointing quality! I excepted much better food at the price and based on the high yelp rating. Don't be fooled. The food is not terrible but it is below average. I would not recommend this place unless you are starving."}
{"text":"Backyard Taco is a great little place for cheap tacos, especially on Tuesdays. At this location it's a little bit of a pain to get salsa and stuff (we waited longer in this line than we did for the food), but overall not a big deal. I definitely enjoy coming here when I'm nearby! :)"}
{"text":"The crazy potato is yummy.  I know , not a taco.  The carne asada tacos - meh.  The meat is chopped into itsy bitsy pieces.  And tacos are small size.
Patio was nice, very shaded and cool"}
{"text":"Food was fresh and delicious. The service was great. The horchata was super good and \"homemade\". I had their chicken potato dish and it was just enough food."}
{"text":"i love backyard tacos. their carne asada is the tits.. probably the best carne asada ive had in arizona."}
{"text":"I love this place food-wise, I crave it because it is healthy and tasty. However, I have found myself going there less and less because of the awkward lines and long wait times. It is extremely difficult to get salsa and awkward standing next to everybody like a tin of HUMAN SARDINES, as the restaurant packs way too many people in a crowded and cramped space. As I said in a different post, they need to redesign their salsa bar so that people can get it from two different sides and remove a table,  and OR  add another salsa bar.

SUCH AN EASY FIX   Also, lower the music as it it is ridiculously loud sometimes and the sound here echoes and reverberates, especially being alongside a heavy road full of car fumes and loud congested traffic. Feels like a distorted horror movie with circus music, screaming people, flies swarming, and cars whizzing by."}
{"text":"This is a pretty cool place to get street tacos. They cook their meats over charcoal and it adds a really nice flavor to it. I highly recommend the Carne Asada Tacos, Yummy ! They are the small type so you may want to get 3 or 4 of them. 

They have a nice little patio in the from so you can enjoy your food outside on a nice day. This place is located in Mesa, AZ and is close to Gilbert Rd. and University. 

Stop in for some Tacos, you will love them!"}
{"text":"Friday at the office we decided to order Tacos from Back Yard Tacos... Oh my, I thought. 
Everyone who knows how office lunch order picks can be a night mare. Well I send out an email with Back Yard tacos web link, and said order by 1030 and pay in advance and let Back Yard taco know the order will be under Liz. I will pick up order at 1130.
I got to Back Yard Taco, the attendance was great. She know who I was. They had everything ready for me. I took less than 10 minutes. Also, they have free grilled onions,,,yum.
Thank you Back Yard Tacos
No picture... I finished my tacos sorry"}
{"text":"Literally one of the best tacos I've ever had in Arizona. This place is a gem!"}
{"text":"Really yummy tacos at a really great price! Carne asada tacos were delicious  chicken was a solid choice too. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the tacos from here, to the point its addicting"}
{"text":"Backyard Taco changed my life. The food here is amazing and so is the horchata. I always see the owners working here, so you know they are paying attention to quality! I've become a vegetarian, and they have a few veggie options which is cool too! It's usually pretty hard to find that with Mexican food."}
{"text":"Finally a Mexican street-style taco in Mesa that doesn't give you a stomachache.
Yelp requires that I leave it longer review, so let me say that the salsa and guacamole options are also great. I wish they gave free sour cream, but life can't be perfect."}
{"text":"This is my family's favorite taco restaurant. Everything I've eaten there from the tacos to the burritos and even the quesadillas have been excellent. The prices are reasonable and the restaurant is clean and bright. If we are ever in the mood for tacos or Mexican food this is the first place we go."}
{"text":"One of my favorite taco places in Gilbert. Good prices and great tacos. The whole family loves backyard tacos and we will be back often."}
{"text":"Soooo good! Love the small, cozy feel of this place and the food was awesome!! Great prices and super fast service! Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Not impressed, I've been here maybe 5 months and I can already guarantee this is not the best taco in the city. 

They are quite honestly bland with no flavor, costly, not to mention the dirty tables all over the place. 

Walking around trying to find a clean table was like pulling teeth. Like I said, you can do better somewhere else."}
{"text":"Best tacos in the Phoenix area.... They are actually the SAME EXACT tacos you can get in mazatlán Mexico on the beach... YES, yes they ARE!!! Super authentic style street tacos, I'm in love! Fast casual and delicious salsa bar!! Thanks backyard taco for your dedication to great authentic style Mexican cuisine!! I love you guys!"}
{"text":"Was pleased with Backyard Taco! I went here to meet someone for lunch today, and it was a bit of a drive for me, but I'd say it was worth it. 
This is a cute little taco shop, a good amount of outdoor seating, and it wasn't too busy when we went. I checked in on yelp for free chips and salsa and was excited when I saw the salsa bar! There was only one vegetarian option, the crazy potato, so I ordered that. This was not like a typical meal that is order, but it was very good! Id get it again! The guacamole was a little odd, it was like liquified. But not bad! Chips and salsa were pretty good.
Backyard taco was also very clean when we went and our food was given to us in a timely matter! The food was super inexpensive too which was great. Overall, I was impressed with my experience here and would return if I happened to be back in the area."}
{"text":"So excited to have tried this place! I love it! The workers are great also, great customer service!!"}
{"text":"Great service! Burrito was delicious! Cool place to hang out! 25 dollar family taco platter can really feed 4 to 5 people maybe even 6. Would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"I was really excited when I heard Backyard was coming to Gilbert, a mile from my house. The original in Mesa is awesome for so many reasons. I gave the new location a few months to get things together and I am glad I did, based on early Yelp reviews. I proceeded to eat there 3 times in a week! The location itself is great, a very nice building and patio setup. For me, the char grilled meats steal the show. You can smell it from the parking lot and hunger sets in. Pastor is one of my favorite foods, so it is hard for me to move past that. They do it well, both in taco and Burro form. I also tried the carne which was average-above average. The salsa bar is really good! Many to choose from and they are quality, minus the Guac. Prices are fair and the service was friendly. The drive thru is now open, so that 3 x a week may turn into 4! Glad to have you in Gilbert, Backyard!"}
{"text":"The Mesa location for some reason seems to far exceed the new Gilbert restaurant, and the taste is a solid 4 stars, plus they have great people working there.  Nice street taco, but not the best....."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday. They do have taco Tuesday for $1.80 a taco, if I remember correctly.
Regular price is around $2.20 or something close to that. 

Came around lunch time, right before he got super busy.
Right after you parked their car and you're on your way inside, you can smell the meat. Always a good sign. They have a pretty big menu with all your basic stuff besides tacos as well. However I came wanting to try the tacos. 
I order a al pastor, carne asada and Pollo on corn tortilla. With everything that comes with it. Then I went over to the salsa bar, which was pretty good. They have a maybe for types of salsa. They had the spicy, on the green, and two other ones. And I had Limes which i loved. They also had the cucumber and the radish I believe. And they also had some of the onions, purple looking onions. And of course the pico de gallo. Overall, the salsa bar was amazing. You can keep refilling as you desire.

Didn't take too long for the tacos to get made. Service was quick. cashier was friendly.

Check the picture for the tacos.

Taste:
Overall, I could eat all the tacos a second time at the same sitting.
Full of flavor, I also did add pretty much all these salsa and toppings on my tacos. The meats weren't too dry And they have flavor.
For the al pastor Taco, they do have pineapple, but I did not get as much meat as I would have liked.
For the carne asada and the pollo, you get a decent amount. 

Tacos were falling apart after I talked everything on the tacos. Use a fork.

Parking lot is Tiny, and if you do come here around lunch time there might not be any parking.
Restroom is clean.
They do have outdoor seating as well with water sprinklers during the day.
Seating inside is possible, could become limited real quickly.

Overall, would definitely come here again for the tacos, especially on Taco Tuesday because of the price. Come here and check it out on a Tuesday!"}
{"text":"My buddy brought me here for a quick lunch. He ordered something for me that I never would have tried: the crazy potato. I was genuinely surprised; in the words of Dora the Explorer: \"yum, yum, yum... delicioso!\" 

The place was clean, the staff pleasant, and atmosphere above average for a quick-stop eatery. 

If you are in the neighborhood, don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in the whole area.  I love all their grilled meat, but keep going back for the carne asada.  It's a casual place where they take your order at the counter and you wait to be called.  The lines can be long, especially on Taco Tuesdays, but the delicious food is well worth the wait.  And the wait really isn't that long; 10 minutes at most when they're busy.
There are tables inside and out, but lots of people take the food to go.  The salsa bar has a nice variety of salsas and my favorites are the pico and guacamole salsa."}
{"text":"This place has been my work's go to place for catering during the day. They make it so easy to order the family packs and get all of the delicious toppings for our Taco Tuesday's. Their beans are so incredible and their steak has this unreal smokey flavor that cannot be mimicked. I'd suggest that the shredded beef is something you try because it's made with something of the Gods. Gracias, Backyard Tacos, for the most unique taco in Mesa!"}
{"text":"Finally, a place to go that reminds me of some of the unique eating spots in Phoenix!  Love the garage door style windows open to the outsides. Makes for a great vibe, and the food is good too. Nice salsa bar."}
{"text":"The chicken was awesome.  

The steak was very good too.  Plus the chip dip was yum! 

These tacos remind me of the street tacos in Mexico. 

So good!"}
{"text":"Been a few times, also had take-out, love the tacos in either double-corn or flour tortilla style. Carnitas are great, sauces are spicy and fresh, chips are also very good."}
{"text":"Tasty, affordable and quick! Have been here a couple times for tacos and quesadillas."}
{"text":"I would say the food is decent...a bit pricey for what you get.  And I feel like this place is so overrated.  Sorry..."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday's. Wow! Go early. The line backs up, but it's definitely worth the wait. Great Mexican food!"}
{"text":"It took us long enough to try this place.  We are fools for street tacos.  This place was crowded and busy and about as backyard as you'd expect.  The atmosphere is very casual.  Our table was dirty.  But the tacos were very good."}
{"text":"If you like street tacos this is the place. Could be cheaper but its a local business and it taste great. Can't say no if I'm I'm the area."}
{"text":"I enjoyed their tacos!!! I felt like it was as close to authentic that I could get without going across the boarder or driving a ways!"}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is nice, clean and modern, no your regular Mexican restaurant.
Service is fast, you can see people working in your food. They're also helpful and kind when you're making your order.
But, the best of everything is THE FOOD, best carne asada around. They have also other options (chicken, al pastor, shredded beef).
Fresh tortillas, salsa bar to add to your food is included.
Ask for the grill onions and jalapeños, they are complimentary, and they're delicious, Believe me, it will change your food for the better, it will increase the flavors.
Favorite and best taco place around."}
{"text":"I love that they give you free grilled onions, and jalapeños to go along with those bomb tacos!"}
{"text":"Great tasting Mexican food! I love how fresh everything tastes. This nice little place is great to eat at or take out. It has that authentic atmosphere and it is very decent. Love the steak and chicken tacos. Has a lot of flavor!"}
{"text":"I usually go to the other location on broadway, so we decided to try this one out today.  Not bad! I like this taco place. the only downfall is the drivethru line is out of control, way too long to wait for tacos, and going inside isn't much better.
but the food is pretty good.!"}
{"text":"This was a very disappointing experience. Despite the recent and displayed \"A\" rating, the cashier was eating while she was taking my order. I ordered steak, chicken, and shedded beef tacos and all of them were underwhelming.  The salsa is by far the most disappointing part of the experience. If you order the chips and salsa, be prepared for salsa that tastes like popcorn. Yes, I said popcorn. The salsa bar didn't offer better options either."}
{"text":"This is by far the best place for tacos on the East Side. Taco Tuesdays can not be beat. Staff is fast and efficient, even when there's a line out the door."}
{"text":"This a hidden gem!!! I am so happy to have found this place for everything in the menu are amazing and very affordable!! You can tell that the ingredients are fresh and everything taste homemade. The customer service is good too, food comes out in a timely, efficient manner. I guess the only downside to this place is the lack of parking space. However, my friends and I can definitely overlook that for the AMAZING food!"}
{"text":"Tried this place solely on yelp reviews and we were not disappointed! Busy on a Sat night is a GREAT sign also. Delicious street tacos...cheap. Had the carne asada and the chicken. YUM. We will back to try more!"}
{"text":"Not sure what I missed but just did not love Backyard Taco like my fellow yelpers. Maybe I was just expecting too much given the amazingly positive reviews. I really did try a lot of food (many tacos, crazy potatoes,etc) but just think my food experience was average. I would state though that the crazy potatoes were tasty and different. Would get that item again. Maybe I need to try this spot again so I can for sure state that my yelping friends are crazy :) JK :) Still trust you all...well most of you :)"}
{"text":"My least favorite Mexican food in the area. A lot of hype for bad service and even worse food. I will not be visiting again."}
{"text":"Nice divey taco shop in Mesa Arizona! All the sauces were very delicious and some a little spicy. My group ordered for tacos and two gordita's and the total was $15! Great price for some authentic Mexican food in Phoenix area. Definitely will recommend to my friends and come back during my trip they even take American Express which is great for an expense report LOL"}
{"text":"First time eating at Backyard Taco and left happy! We tried the Crazy Potato w/Carne Asada and a Carne Asada taco. 

The crazy potato is essentially a baked potato loaded with all the fixings plus your choice of meat (carne asada, pollo, or birria) inside a tinfoil bag. All in all the crazy potato was a hit. Would recommend. 

The carne asada taco was pretty good too. I tried mine with the tomatillo salsa to add a nice level of spiciness. Tacos are about $2 each and about the size of a standard street taco. 

Service was great, food was excellent and will be coming back for more."}
{"text":"was pretty good, meat a little over cooked (aka dry or burned) on a few"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! Especially the tacos, it's a great place to satisfy your craving of Mexican food. Although the food is a bit expensive when comparing it to the portion size, it's still worth it. It's a place I'd recommend everyone try."}
{"text":"Best street tacos in town! Everytime I get the opportunity to eat here I do.  Very busy during lunch time, but worth the wait everytime."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! I've gotten the crazy potato, tacos, burritos, and the chips and salsa. I love the medium salsa and am never disappointed with the speed and taste of this place. Fantastic."}
{"text":"We visited this joint few days ago for lunch. They were quite busy, but the service is fast. You get that delicious smells of the grilled BBQ meats as soon a you walk in, which is awesome. If you are not hungry just the smell will make you hungry. 
The tacos are awesome.  
Even their simple beans and cheese burrito better than most places we have tried."}
{"text":"Their tacos are flavorful and does the job when you want a quick lunch. I like that they have the vege/ sauce bar so you can get as much as you want without having to go back to the counter."}
{"text":"Lesly have BAD attitude with customers. She needs to work behind the scene in this restaurant.. maybe a dishwasher or something.
And food quality wasn't so good. Not recommended. I can make better tacos."}
{"text":"I tried backyard taco for the first time as it is down the street from my neighborhood. Other neighbors had warned about long wait times so I decided to wait a few weeks for the crowds to die down a bit. There wasn't a very long wait (1 star). I ordered a flan (one of my favorite desserts), a carne asada quesadilla and a drink which totaled about $11. As I was waiting for my food, I tried the flan which was handed to me at the register. It came in an individually packaged plastic container. Right off the bat I noticed that there wasn't any caramel sauce. I took a bite and this has to be the worst flan I've ever tasted. It wasn't a creamy, caramel texture at all. More like a flavorless sponge cake that was undercooked. I can't even really describe it. My food was ready and I could already tell I'd be disappointed again. The quesadilla was just a large tortilla with carne asada and cheese. Not melted together or anything. It was clumsily folded in half like a taco. Next I noticed how much grease was pooling at the bottom of the plate. The tortilla was drenched in grease and the carne asada was swimming in it. Now, I'm all for greasy food, but I don't want to be able to fill sauce cups from the salsa bar with excess grease dripping from my plate. I tried to soak up the grease with napkins but just ended up losing my appetite. I won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb!!! Mary helped us and she was so sweet and helpful! The salsa is so good and they have late hours!"}
{"text":"Delicious steak burrito. Average prices. Very small inside. fast food stop. Not superclean."}
{"text":"Just visiting. Had one of each kind of taco. Amazingly simple and tasty! Watch the orange colored salsa it's very hot. Nice outdoor seating. No alcohol."}
{"text":"Best carne asada in town. I love the tacos, vampiros, and their sauces. Only downside is the price is a bit much compared to places around and for the area it's in but it's probably because of the quality of the food."}
{"text":"We watched patiently as this place was getting built and were pretty excited to give this place a try. Drove by one afternoon after seeing my friends snaps earlier that day and them telling us they liked the place. 

We ordered 4 tacos, a tostada, a quesadilla and a horchata through the drive thru. The girl at the window didn't seem too friendly,  but whatever, maybe it was the heat.. we got our food and waited for the girl to ask of we wanted any sauces, since apparently they have a pretty good salsa bar, that didn't happen. So we drove off thinking maybe a sample of each were already in there. I looked through our lol bag and saw ONE sauce for all of our food, awesome. 

Got home, opened up everything and I said out loud \"That's it, well maybe it's very flavorful!?\" 
Nope.
The carne asada tacos were bland even with my runny tomato paste of a sauce, added no extra flavor. Chicken tacos was a bit better, definitely marinated better than the steak.
El pastor taco was alright.
Carne asada tostada was bland and too chewy, maybe if I go back, next time I won't get it \"crispy.\"
Quesadilla... was not even a quesadilla, it was literally an oversized taco with a tad of cheese in the fold to keep it closed. 
Horchata was actually pretty good, not the best I've had, but compared to everything else it was definitely yum.
All in all, most likely won't be returning."}
{"text":"My family wanted to try somewhere new for Taco Tuesday. We are there several hours ago and I still have the hebbie jeebies. So gross. I just don't understand. No one in my family really liked their food and my kids all asked to go to Del Taco as we were leaving. I'll eat at Del Taco or Filbertos any day before I eat here again. 

Not super great prices. Tacos are kinda small. Chicken meat is full of fat and gristle.  Sauce on them is a little weird. I loaded mine up with pico de gallo because the food was bland without it."}
{"text":"I love their food, however the small amount of seating is sometimes a hassle."}
{"text":"First visit tonight, did the drive they due to fussy children. Husband and I had high expectations for flavorful meat street tacos. We opted for the family pack and chose half carne asada and half pastor, a crazy potato chicken and horchata drink. Our order was $42, a pretty penny vs our taco spots in phx. When we got home we were totally let down by the tacos the meat had no flavor. We wanted to see what the hype was about and I wished we hadn't. Sams club packaged pastor and carne asada is way better! Save your $ people and make street tacos at home"}
{"text":"Ordered carne asads quesadillas, one of our favorites at Backyard Taco. When my wife got home with the order she found that it was completely incorrect. She called up to speak with the manager just to let him know that she was disappointed because the order was wrong. He said that he was the owner and that he wanted to make it right. She explained that unfortunately, she could not drive back up to pick up the order as our nurses had gone home for the evening and she had to care for the 4 medical children in the  our home. Not only did he re-make the order, he insisted on driving it out to our house personally to make it right. 

I want to thank the owner personally (don't know his name) for going above and beyond to make things right. In our household, time is precious. I didn't have to stop on my way home from work to pick up the new order and my wife could simply care for the kids.  

 Oh...we got chicken quesadillia on the first order instead of the carne asada and of course I had to try it. I just might have a new favorite. 

Thank you again."}
{"text":"Pretty good stuff here, they have a nice selection of flavorful, quickly made Mexican food. I had a few things here to get a good feel and all the items I tried were on point. The place was busy, so it appears locals like this joint. Always nice to have good Mexican restaurants to choose from."}
{"text":"Kinda expensive for what you get, plus the guacamole is runny.. I guess I expected roach coach prices and better tacos. I would not like to go back again and do not recommend. Hit something better and authentic if you want quality Mexican comida."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't taken the time to rave about this place. Fabulous grilled meats. Love the crazy potatoes with toppings. Tuesday Tacos night $1.25. The salsas are great. And if you like flan, order it as soon as you get there. It is homemade and they run out fast. Sometimes, I stop just for the flan. It is family owned. The prices are great and they give you a punch card which they trade for $5.00 off after 10 punches. The only drawback here is it is always crowded."}
{"text":"Best Kearny Asada in town. Good tacos good food little cramped for parking and always seems a little crazy but the food is worth it"}
{"text":"Delicious food at a great price, friendly service, & fun atmosphere!  Fun place to go with family & friends!"}
{"text":"Backyard Taco is my favorite taco shop! I'm glad Yelp reminded me of them, because I haven't gone as frequently since changing jobs to farther away. Their prices are reasonable, and the carne asada is phenomenal. I always get the carne asada tacos on corn tortillas. My husband likes their burritos, but with his appetite, he needs a little extra. They have a salsa bar out, which is very handy. They do large meals to go for families, which we did with a group of friends. That turned out well. Be patient. I've mostly been there during the lunch hour, but also a few times for lunch. It has always been busy. They call your order number out over the sound system, so you can hear them even from outside."}
{"text":"Been here twice on my visit in Arizona this week lol.  My girlfriend told me about this place.  A coworker of hers suggested we try this place if we wanted some real good street tacos and I must say she was damn right!  I been to Arizona a few times tried a lot of tacos but nothing compares to this.  All I can say is this place is \"Legit\"
My fav would be the Carne Asada Gordita with the work.  The meat is sooo tasty I can and has the char taste that brings out those flavors in the meats.  The Birria would be next and the Pollo is so juicy and tender they all are must try.  If you're in the area I would highly recommend coming here.  The salsa bar was awesome.  Theybhave all types of salsa from your pico to the Birria sauce which was fuego as hell had me sweating but was def worth the burn lol.  
The food is bomb and the prices are reasonable not overly price.  You def can get full off $10 dollars.  
 When I'm back in Arizona def coming back here and getting my fix."}
{"text":"I love the crazy potato.  Pretty sure I could devour a dozen steak tacos!  This location is big, with a huge outdoor patio as well.  There's a drive-thru for orders on the go. All around a great place to get something to eat!"}
{"text":"The tacos here are amazing, we drive across town for them probably once a month!!  I love the carne asada tacos with corn tortillas.  The carne asada burrito is really good too!
We also get the chips and salsa, the salsa that comes with the chips is different than the other salsas, it's a little thin so we just add the pico de gallo from the salsa bar to it!  So good!  We like almost all the salsas from the salsa bar and have to have a little of each every time!
Only thing I've had that I didn't care for was the gordita, I ordered it crispy and it was too hard to chew, so order it soft.  
Be prepared to probably sit outside, we've only ever sat inside two times I think!  But the patio is shaded and even in the summer isn't too bad."}
{"text":"This restaurant reminds me of a Mexican-style restaurant. The menu you order from is a very simple. It shows you the style of food you're getting along with the meat options but not much else. You essentially order the food at the counter, pick up your condiments from a cart, and you sit and wait until your number is ready. If you're looking for a sit-down restaurant with wait staff, this place isn't for you. If you're looking for good tacos in a good casual setting, I would recommend you try this place!

The idea of this type of restaurant is mildly strange to me since it is the only of its kind for many miles. I feel that it's essentially a Mexican restaurant from Mexico transplanted into the heart of Agritopia Gilbert. It's a welcome sight!

Anyway, back to the restaurant and food. My boyfriend and I went to this place at 8:30 in the evening. From entering the establishment to ordering to getting our food, it was maybe 5-10 minutes. It was pretty quick but there was a good steady stream of people. Based on my observation and other reviews, it seems that there may be a wait if you go during peak hours. The restaurant itself is trendy in appearance and as far as I could tell, it was pretty clean. It's a very open restaurant with both indoor and outdoor seating. The patios had fans as well as heaters.

The food itself was pretty decent! If I could give 4.5 stars, I would. I got the tacos- carne asada, chicken, and barria, all on corn tortillas. My boyfriend got a carne asada gordita and a cheese quesadilla. I was very impressed by the corn tortillas. They were very moist and didn't feel like dry cardboard going down my throat as I swallowed. However, the chicken and carne asada were slightly dry, and this would be the reason for docking 0.5 stars. All the meats had very good flavor, and their salsas had a little spice to it! I always appreciate a Mexican food place with some spice to their salsa since I feel that a lot of places have very mild, non-spicy salsa. I really liked the fact that the cabbage (I think it was cabbage...maybe it was lettuce) on the tacos were diced. Actually, all their chicken and carne asada were cubed as well, but I actually like my meat this way. It made eating the taco so much easier! The tacos are smaller...but I think they're appropriately sized. Just giving you a heads up!

I would definitely return to this place and try more of their food. This place is definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"The carne asada here is super good, but that's about it.  I came here the other night and tried a few dishes; overall the chicken was really dry, the chips and salsa were terrible and the carne was good.  Not worth the trip in my opinion, but to each their own.  Also, whats with the 80's music at a mexican taco stand?"}
{"text":"Talk about authentic!! I had their tacos for lunch and simply left with a smile on my face and happy belly! That pork sauce that they add on top of the tacos is Just so savory!!! All their salsas were so good!! I can't wait to back again!!! And their prices are great too!!"}
{"text":"The potatoes are my favorite thing on the menu. Do yourself a favor and get one. 

This place is clean, cool trendy decor, great staff. It's always busy (which says something good about the food) and I'm never disappointed. I'm getting hungry just thinking about this place. The kitchen is open to the dining room so you can watch your food be made."}
{"text":"I'm a Mexican food fan and LOVE Backyard tacos.  These street tacos are fantastic.
I highly recommend this place.  Clean, fast , delicious."}
{"text":"Really good food, a bit pricey for what you get but the place was super busy when we went.
They serve \"tacos\" on soft shell so beware that's what you'll get.
The meats were amazing and the potato was top notch.
As usual, classless people let their kids do whateverthehell they want in here, screaming, yelling, running etc, so it's stupid loud in there.... We got ours to go as the noise was unbearable. But that's not Backyard Taco's fault..... society.......
Great place, we'll repeat."}
{"text":"Food is ok but service is a bit slow. That may be due to newness of this place. My main concern is how ridiculous it is to turn into the lot from northbound Higley. This business is too large for this small strip mall. Insufficient parking and traffic flow."}
{"text":"Best I can say...  average. 

Nothing stood out to me. Their carne was ok. The salsa was ok.. maybe it's me because they are always busy.."}
{"text":"This is the best little taco stand for tacos al carbon. Not fancy, kinda ghetto, but our entire family loves the food. We especially love the carne asada burritos and tacos.  Their green jalapeño sauce makes me drool just to think about drizzling it over a big burrito de carne asada with everything on it.  I bought a t shirt and now get a free taco every time I come in wearing it.  Good horchata too!"}
{"text":"Carne asada tacos are chopped to fine and way over cooked. Disappointed by the service too."}
{"text":"We really liked the place...nice ambiance, good tasting food, close to home. Yes, the portions are small, but its tasty. I really liked the quesadilla and crazy potato. The chicken tacos were good, too. We'll go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Really great carne tacos plus with the chips and salsa promo.... delicious!  Nice staff, clean, needs some more inside seating."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic! Tried a carne Asada quesadilla and it was really good. I would come back and try it out again for sure. 

The service though......not so good. 
I know they are new and there is some grace that goes with that, but their assembly line and expediter are a hot mess. They were busy, so the wait time is expected to be longer. I am ok with that. However, they got order after order wrong. They didn't check tickets and gave food to the wrong people. This caused them to have to remake their food, which put the rest of the orders further behind. A simple checking of the tickets would have solved half the issues. They got my order wrong. I asked for no onions. I saw them put it on, then attempt to take them off one by one. They should have offered to remake it, but didn't. I refused the food and asked them to remake it. They did, but it didn't look nearly as good as the first one. It tasted great, but their mistake made my experience suffer. 

I hope this is just the newness effect and that a visit later on will show the improvement in service. I want this place to be awesome and I think it has the legs to do it!"}
{"text":"We have driven by this place several times, and it smelled really good so today we decided to stop in for a first-time.  the street tacos are Beyond Compare they are amazing!! If you haven't tried this place you are missing out, we highly recommended Backyard Taco."}
{"text":"Very, very busy when I went.  Food was very good!  Wish there was some pineapple on the al pastor tacos!"}
{"text":"Placed an order for pickup over the phone and was told it would be ready in 20 minutes. I show up to pay after about 25 minutes. There's one gigantic line out the door so I walk up to the side to pay as I was told I could do. Still had to wait a few minutes which was no big deal. After paying, I thought my order would have been called shortly. It was not. 10 minutes goes by. Then 20 minutes. Now 30 minutes have gone by and still nothing. I go back to the counter and tell the young lady I'm still waiting on an order that was supposed to be ready over a half an hour ago. She looks confused so I hand her my receipt showing her I paid already. No apology for the delay or inconvenience but what I got instead was a please wait over to the side and they'll call your order soon. Looking back on it now I should have said forget it and asked for a refund. 

Got my food finally and it was less than what I've grown accustomed to when dining here. The carne asada was dry and a terrible cut as it was so tough to chew. I only ate 1 of my 3 tacos because of it. After eating chicken tinga tacos at Crescent Ballroom for lunch, I can say these backyard tacos couldn't hold a candlestick to theirs. The kids who work here are nice and all but management needs to creat a more organized system for pick up orders by creating a designated area for said orders. Either that or they need to forego accepting call in orders altogether. I used to brag about this place to all my friends and family but I sadly won't be returning. Do yourself a favor and take your business somewhere else."}
{"text":"The most reliable, reasonably priced, and above all delicious little street tacos one could hope to have. Worth the trip every single time."}
{"text":"Backyard Taco is simply the best! There is none more authentic and the Mesquite grilled meat is to die for!"}
{"text":"Don't let any body fool you about better tacos because these are the best! A real authentic Mexican taco shop"}
{"text":"Their beans are okay tortillas are good. But I asked for some vegetables in the burrito and they just didn't get that concept."}
{"text":"Backyard Taco!!! OMG this is the best hole in the wall place I have found out here in the valley! 

Don't except fancy schmancy, because you won't find it! What you will find is some pretty great street tacos.

The place is cute; it looks like someone gutted out a house turned the yard into a parking lot & place into a restaurant.  They do have tables inside & a nice seating area outside (they do have the portable heaters outside too) 

The menu is up on a board its easy and simple to follow. You can see the meat cooking on the grill behind the counter.  The kitchen is a busy place, the place is a busy place, but everything moves fast & smoothly. 

I have been to Backyard a few times now and I can absolutely say the carne asada tacos are the bomb! So So good!  I'm sure the chicken & veggie ones are too.  Also dig the carne asada burrito, so damn good! When you check in on Yelp, you get a free order of chips and salsa and let me tell you they do not skimp out on the chips!  They also have a great salsa bar to pick up some extra too!

Backyard Taco is quickly becoming my favorite grubbing place to go, in a moment of weakness I took my son and his boyfriend and now they are begging to go back too....so much for keeping it just my spot haha.

Oh and they even hand out a Repeat Eater Card after the 10th visit you earn a free meal, I see this happening soon haha."}
{"text":"Should have listened to the reviews on yelp. Just got home from backyard taco. After I ordered my 3 tacos, and I found out there were only 6 orders in front of me, and the kitchen was well staffed (I was order 206). About 5 minutes later I heard them call out order 201. I waited patiently, but was surprised they were taking so long. If someone was at the counter the staff would give them their order without announcing it. After 20 minutes they called for order 210 over the speaker. When I went up to the counter to see why my order still hadn't been called, I noticed order 210 had ordered over 15 tacos, so I was confused as to why they were called first. When I asked they asked for my receipt, which I presented, and they informed me they had skipped my order entirely. I waited over 20 minutes to get 3 small tacos that should have taken 5 - 10 minutes at the most. The service was horrible, and when I expressed my frustration, they did nothing to rectify the situation."}
{"text":"Long lines are worth the wait. The food is amazing. The thing to get us definitely the carne asada papa loca. It's one of the most amazing things I've eaten."}
{"text":"I have had better. My carne Asada was burnt plus it was too salty.  There are better places in Mesa for street tacos. I was really hoping to like this place since the Yelp reviews were so positive. This is a very busy place. I will say that the owners run a tight ship because the orders were quick and people were eating right away. They have a check in offer, free chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Been getting tacos from Ruben and Mariela since they were in their real Backyard! Haven't even found a taco that comes close to this. If you haven't eaten here yet: You Are Doing It Wrong!"}
{"text":"We were disappointed. The meat is good, but the beans seem watered down. We might order tacos to go, but we won't go in to eat again for two reasons: First, there is zero atmosphere and the staff isn't friendly. It feels like eating in a cafeteria. No thanks. Second, everything is served on styrofoam or plastic. This place creates a ridiculous amount of waste! If you're looking for tasty beef or chicken tacos to go, I think you'll be happy. For dine-in, I think there are many better choices if the area."}
{"text":"I love Backyard Taco!!  I will drive out of my way to go there!!  The flavor is AMAZING, and the service is quick!  The only think lacking is a Margarita to go with their delicious food!!"}
{"text":"Finally, a good Mexican place in Gilbert! The tacos are worth it especially on taco Tuesday when they're discounted!"}
{"text":"Backyard Taco is the bomb! We love backyard taco! Their tacos are delicious! Service is friendly and fast too! We drive all the way from Tempe to get backyard taco. Their tacos are the closest to real authentic Mexico street tacos in Arizona!"}
{"text":"Have came to backyard taco many times. Amazing food and great service. Always fresh too. Haven't gotten a bad taco yet surprisingly. Pricing is fair. Not expensive but you do pay for quality."}
{"text":"It's really good food. The crazy potato is the best thing on the menu. The Carne Asada  has been dry at times but not enough to detract from the overall."}
{"text":"Good food, portions are a little small for the prices.  They used to be much larger and better quality.  Still good, just miss the old days."}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE Backyard Taco, and are so happy it's within driving distance. They make the best carne asada I've ever had. In fact, everything is delicious! The only menu item that's \"just okay\" is the refried beans, but they are fine - just not amazing like so many other menu items.

This is a small establishment with just around 6 or 7 tables indoors, and maybe 10-12 outdoors. They have a misting system, which helps during the hot summer months. Expect a line when you order (a good sign for any food place) but your number should be called fairly quickly. 

You must try Backyard Taco!"}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal. My company comes here quite frequently and no one has any complaints. We just placed an order for 9 different people and the total was under $70. Crazy potato is DELICIOUS!! Strongly recommend for any family, business, or casual date."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this place as I've heard great reviews about it. I was sorely disappointed. My family ordered the bean and cheese burrito, carne asada tacos, chicken tacos, cheese quesadilla and chips and salsa. Everything was completely overpriced and small in proportion. The flavoring was mediocre and lacked in substance. We would have been better off going to Filibertos."}
{"text":"I visited yesterday for the first time. The $1.50 taco special brought me in but I plan on coming back and have no problem paying the regular price (which isn't bad at all). Everything was very tasty. I especially liked the birria taco. Even though the line looked long, it moved really fast and we got our food even faster. The gentleman that took our order at the counter was extremely friendly and had a great sense of humor. I look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Food was okay, i liked the guacamole sauce. We got 2 chicken tacos, a chicken quesadilla and a drink for $10. Tacos come with cabbage and onions and a teeny blob of something red. The staff is not very friendly. Knocked off stars for the number of flies in the place!! Very gross!"}
{"text":"Quick service and great food!!  I've been to this place twice and both times the food was awesome."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places! Backyard Taco never disappoints! I've taken many friends and out of town visitors & while it may not look like much from the street the food is AMAZING!!! 

I try to get here at least once every two weeks if possible, and that is never enough. Love, love, love the chicken & carne asada soft corn tortilla tacos & the salsa bar is the bomb! They'll give you free grilled jalapenos & onions upon request to add extra fire...YUM! Mom loves the chicken quesadilla and the chips & salsa. I can't say that I blame her. They are delicious, as well.

P.S. Don't forget to leave a tip in the jar. The workers here are the best of the best!"}
{"text":"The first thing you notice is a strong char grilled smell as you enter. Everything here is grilled open flame. They had a a full grill of tomatoes I assume they turn into their salsa due to the smoky flavor. I loved the crispy carne asada gordita."}
{"text":"I'm in town visiting this weekend and my friends brought me to this place. Y'all, it was SO GOOD!!! The carne asada burrito was insanely good. The salsas were perfect. Definitely check this place out if you get the chance!!"}
{"text":"These are the only authentic Mexican tacos in the valley! There's a reason why this place is always packed. 

Next time you want delicious tacos or quesadillas get over to back yard tacos!!!"}
{"text":"This place is sooooo overrated and pricey for what you get! The carne Asada is burnt. The quesadillas are tiny and pricey.,You stick cheese in a tortilla. Closed on sundays, really, so stupid!!"}
{"text":"Yummazing!  Carne asada quesadilla, horchata, and chips and salsa were all incredible.  My father got a chicken quesadilla and loved it.  Their salsa bar is fabulous, as well."}
{"text":"This location is just so much nicer and easier to navigate than the one in Mesa.  The salsa bar is in a good location so people can fill containers on both sides.  They have a ton of outdoor seating and areas outdoors so kids can run around.  Their food tastes the same as the original location.  The bean burritos are fantastic and pretty much any meat you get in a taco will taste great."}
{"text":"YUM!!!!  This place is a little gem in Mesa.  My hubby and I stopped in on a Saturday for lunch and apparently beat the rush, because right after we ordered, the line started growing out the door and onto the patio.  We ordered street tacos, of which we like both the beef ones the best.  We also both ordered a bean and cheese burrito, which was way too much food, but we both couldn't stop eating because it was one of the best bean and cheese burritos either of us had eaten before.  The salsa bar was also to die for- at least 4 different salsas to choose from along with cucumbers and pickled onions.  We took full advantage of the free check in offer of chips and salsa.  The salsa that came with the chips was chunky and juicy at the same time and had a ton of flavor!  Anytime I crave a burrito from now on, we'll be going to Backyard Taco!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Shorted my order and won't do anything to make it right.

 There are better authentic tacos to be found in  this city, put forth the effort because this place isn't worth it."}
{"text":"Hipsters unite to enjoy a room temperature tiny street taco.

The restaurant was clean as was the salsa bar, that's a plus. It seemed larger than it needed to be for what they're serving.

Ordered the al pastor quesadilla and one carne asada taco on a flour tortilla. Husband got two tacos, carne asada and chicken on corn tortillas and a order of chips and salsa. Carne asada had great flavor, hence the one star...

Received order very quickly, nothing was hot, nothing was even approaching warm...not even my quesadilla. It was an open kitchen, so I watched as they pulled together everything for our order from nothing fresh. Although the grills at the front where you order makes you think that you're getting fresh food.

The chips...not house made, looked and tasted like Tostitos, and probably were. Sad...sad...sad...

One last thing, Styrofoam plates and bowls. No, Backyard Taco...No. If you're going to put us through your room temperature tacos, let's not try   to add to the destruction of our environment as well."}
{"text":"Being a simple man bean and cheese burritos and cheese quesadillas are great and the tacos to die for."}
{"text":"Had the potato and street tacos.  Perfect!  Taste was fantastic. Salsa bar is small but delicious.

Very busy!  Recommend calling in order and picking it up.  Line was out the door behind me.  That said I was number 12 and they were calling order 2.  They are very efficient and fast and I did not wait very long.  Woeth the wait!! 

The people who work here are friendly and professional.  

Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food here is so good but it seems a little bit over priced for how much food you get. I would need to spend quite a bit on the meal just for myself to feel full and satisfied. I love the food though. The place is usually pretty clean and organized. Not a ton of seating for guests. It's pretty small."}
{"text":"My friends and I go to this place for Taco Tuesdays as often as possible! Everyone I've brought to this place has absolutely enjoyed it! Well-textured meat, variety of toppings, and cravable flavors. The only improvement I would make is to encourage a higher energy from the staff."}
{"text":"Backyard Tacos.... well, we finally tried it out and its ok. Ya, just ok.
I really wanted to love this place... The proximity to the house makes that unfortunate.

The tacos are ok, we ordered the chicken and carne asada and as many have said on here, they are not that flavorful. The carne asada is better than the chicken. We also ordered bean n cheese burros and those were ok. 

In a pinch, sure we will go. But we'd rather go a few miles south on Higley to 'tacos n more'"}
{"text":"Awesome Taco Tuesday, I forgot my phone at home and one of the girls wouldn't honor the free chips.  I've forgotten the phone before and the owner has always honored the free chips when I didn't have my phone. The girl just said, well he's the owner he could do what he wants, so since you don't have your phone you don't get the chips.  I was I little disappointed that she didn't honor the free chips, but the tacos are good, so not that big of a deal"}
{"text":"It's not a big secret that this place rocks. There's almost always a line when I stop by, but their service is extremely speedy so it'll only be 5 minutes before they finish making your delicious food for you hungry carnivores reading this. 

A stand-alone location that serves up some delicious tacos y burritos y gorditas, Im definitely addicted to their endless salsa bar. 
The guacamole is a miss, but can't really complain when it's free. 

Their free chips & salsa for checking in makes it a 5 star place."}
{"text":"The tiny tacos were delicious! You're going to want three or four. DO NOT buy the flan!!!! Disgusting! Dry, over cooked grainy texture. It seems like it may have been frozen."}
{"text":"In town for a conference. Simple, yet amazing tacos and also an al pastor quesadilla. Long line, but moved quick and definitely worth the wait. If I'm ever in the area again, I'll make this place a priority stop."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos and quick service.  I'd recommend asking for cilantro instead of cabbage -- that didn't really work for me on the chicken and steak tacos.  Otherwise, really good stuff."}
{"text":"My hubby LOVES the chicken & steak quesadillas!  He tried these first, and eventually tried the steak burrito as well.  He's a fan of gringo-style burritos from another popular chain and tried these because it was nearby and devoured them in no time flat.  :)

The sauce bar is pretty cool, that reddish one that's the color of tomato soup seemed to be the only one he gravitated to.  In checking them all out, they all looked pretty good to me.  What impressed me more about the location was the friendly staff and the atmosphere.  Everyone was really working as a team backstage and the dishes were coming out pretty fast for the amount of people waiting.  (Which is appreciated when you're starving, for sure!)

Presentation is very basic, a styro tray and sheet of foil.  No harm no foul, as most chains just use foil as well.  We sat on the patio that had plenty of heaters and nice big tables.  Indoors was jam packed with not a seat in sight, so it's a good thing it had a little heat.

All in all I know we'll be back.  It's a totally cool little spot to grab & go or to sit for a few and kill a craving.  Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Their carne asada is the best. Love it on their tostados, tacos, and potatoes. Great salsas too. It can get very busy and very crowded, so be prepared. But it is worth it. Food is always great."}
{"text":"Sonora style tacos.  Great flavor, great salsa bar. done just right."}
{"text":"I found Backyard Taco through Foursquare and I picked it because of its high rating and most people said that it serves authentic Mexican food. It's a cozy and casual fast food shop with a lot of options. It also has a salsa bar with some choices of salsa, sliced radish, cucumber, onions etc. I ordered steak burrito and when server asked me whether I want everything in it, I said yes.
The burrito was big but to my surprise it was nothing other than bread and meat and even the meat was salty. The water in the glass tank was very obviously tap water. So first impression was not pleasant. I will give this place another chance and I hope next time I get better food."}
{"text":"This place was better than a lot of taco places around but still not that great.  They are close but just not quite there.  The environment is pretty cool and trendy but the tacos could use work."}
{"text":"This is a great little place!  Have only been there once but will go back. Seating inside is limited but they have a nice size patio area."}
{"text":"Been eating their food when it was really in a backyard behind M&M and the fire station *kneeslap!*

I am a regular at this restraunt. Best tacos in the valley! HANDS DOWN!

Simple menu, fair pricing on the food, clean welcoming feeling at the restraunt.

Absolutely good food and service.

Only one problem about this place. It needs to find a bigger location to fit all the customers that go there."}
{"text":"Some of the best carne aside meat I have ever tried. They are grilling the meat right behind the cashiers filling the entire place with a great savory aroma. My only complaints here is the salsa bar... wasn't a fan of any of the salsas available so I decided not to put any on my tacos. Also there is very limited seating and this place was packed at lunch time, we had to stand around and wait for an empty table.
 Never the less it's still definitely worth to check out and try the food!"}
{"text":"Welcome to the Taco Bland-o-rama.

This is a gentrified, more expensive version of the original in central Mesa.

I want to like this place, but that's just not going to be possible. The Steak/Carne Asada and Al Pastor meats have pretty good flavor. The problem comes in with everything else.

The salsa is NOT OK. I really don't know how you can get salsa that wrong in 2 or 3 different versions.

But the thing that really kills me is the cabbage. It is diced so finely that it has a mushy texture. It's horrible.

The only thing that would bring me back is a bulk buy of just the Carne Asada and Al Pastor meats. I would take nothing else with me.

But, if I have to use my own salsa and prepare my own cabbage to get tacos to taste right, I'm working WAY too hard. If I have to go that far, it just makes sense to get some marinaded carne asada at a carniceria. With $25, you can get everything you need to serve stellar tacos to 10 people (well, you'll need a grill too).

These guys got an extra STAR because I ordered a bean burrito and it was OK, bland, but OK.

To the owner(s): How to fix what's wrong....

Here's a VERY SIMPLE bulk Salsa recipe:

1 Gallon Can of Whole Tomatoes
10 Garlic Cloves
8 Jalapenos
1 Large Onion
1 Bunch of Cilantro
Use a Blender or Chopper
Add Salt and Lime to Taste

And for the love of God stop puree-ing your cabbage."}
{"text":"Food is OK but not the best true mexican food.  Seating is nice with lots of patio seating."}
{"text":"I got a steak burrito. Personally I prefer the steak at Americas taco shop but this wasn't too bad. Besides the prices I mean am I right? Hot damn! Over all it was a good experience and it wasn't too long a wait for food. Cash me out at Los favs, Papa Chevos or Americas for my next carne asada though. #whatisliftdriftco"}
{"text":"I love local places born and raised in Mesa and not the crap the chains offer.  This place is funky, fun, and the food is good and fresh.  Lots of cool people there too.  I have been there several times and a few times ago ordered the family pack which is plenty of food for 5 people.  Thanks for brining a new place to our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I love the food here. But it's always crowded, loud and busy. The restaurant has a nice atmosphere. Parking is limited."}
{"text":"Great place to get great food, authentic and my whole family loves to eat here clean great specials. if your looking for a good place to come for lunch or dinner I suggest back yard taco"}
{"text":"The tacos are amazing and there was little to no wait! I highly recommend Backyard Taco!"}
{"text":"Back Yard Taco. 
Fantastic lunch. 
This place is close to my place of employment and is fairly priced and the chicken menu is delicious. 
Lunch time rush is a bit much however, the service is petty quick. 
Frequent stop for me. 
Recommend to all."}
{"text":"Food is ok, the tacos had quite a bit of gristle. This place is not on any short list for me to return. I do not like the atmosphere & there is not enough seating. Don't come if you aren't in the mood to stand & be jostled."}
{"text":"Mexican food is one of my favorites. I came here on taco Tuesday from 2-10 tacos are only $1.80 good thing because they are street taco size. But the corn tortilla carne Asada taco was really good. I will definitely be back again for these. Nice salsa bar and awesome outside patio!"}
{"text":"Boring food, expensive for what it is. 

I won't return. 

I ordered a burrito and it was meat bean and cabbage... very minimalistic. Chipotle is more affordable and a larger portion with more stuff inside. 

Save your money and skip it."}
{"text":"This place was alright. Nothing special to rave about. A lot of people and I guess it was so packed that no workers had time to clean up a lil. Tacos were good, and the Horchata was delicious. Probably will come again whenever I'm in the mood for street style tacos. Price was pretty good as well."}
{"text":"Their tacos aren't too bad, they do kind of remind me of street tacos. It's always busy here, no matter what day/time you come in. Expect a lil bit of a wait, and sometimes we can't find tables either to sit. It was also a bit pricey as well. Not a big fan of this place. I know better Mexican places than this."}
{"text":"Great street tacos. The carne asada is my favorite, with chicken coming in 2nd. Salsas are great. Beware if red chili salsa. VERY HOT!!! Order all you think you can eat at once cuz you have to wait awhile, especially on Taco Tuesday. I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place! Heard about it from some friends and it came highly recommended. I will be saying the same to everyone I know. Everything we've tried has been delicious! I am a fan of carne asada and their tacos, burritos and quesadillas do not disappoint. The salsa bar has a ton of options to compliment all their food. Always busy; it's fist come first serve seating so keep that in mind."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, places like this just don't taste authentic. Think of a mom and pop shop going corporate. I'm guessing it was good before they became big, but now it's just another disappointing Mexican restaurant in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Pretty good tacos here! I'd definitely come back. The ambiance is nice and the space isn't huge so it's a nice place to go with a small group. Oh and the price is super super reasonable!

Coming from San Diego, I'm pretty particular about my Mexican food. After trying all the tacos, I'd say I liked the Carne asada then chicken, and birria in that order. The star of the show for me was the Carne asada tostada!!!! I'm excited to come back and try the rest of the menu, but the tostada may be in my order to stay!"}
{"text":"With all the kudos this place gets, I was super excited to find a good taco joint just down the street from home. 
The service was ok. Standard counter service, though I did have to have another person help me check out because not all the cashiers speak English. That didn't really bother me, in fact it made me feel like I was in for a superb, authentic taco experience. Maybe I was hyping myself up, but I was really starting to look forward to inhaling the half dozen street tacos I ordered. 
Instead, what I bit into was dry, underseasoned carne. Smh. The salsas were good. The carne, however, could not be salvaged. Beef jerky is more tender. 
Next time I will try the potato goodness everyone raves about."}
{"text":"Order incorrect- service terrible! This review is based on the service and poor handling by America (she said she was the manager). I placed an order for two family packs plus a large refried beans. I was informed I could not pick up the order through the drive thru, so I went in. They confirmed the order and handed me the bag. I asked for containers for salsa and condiments and the girl helping me went to give me a few medium sized round containers. Another girl told her to only give the very smallest ones. So I received 5 very small containers. Which held 4 slices of cucumber and 4 lime wedges! Okay- fine. Then I arrive to drop off the food, as it was for a friend and her family as they are moving. Only to discover there are no beans. It was a long drive to pick up the food in Gilbert and deliver it to SE Mesa so I couldn't go back. Instead When I called, I was told by America, the manager that I can come and pick them up (no apology). When I explained I couldn't come back and would just like a refund (they made me pay over the phone since it was more than $20) I was told I need to keep my receipt and bring it in for a refund. No receipt no refund. Very poor service and I certainly will not be back or recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Excellent carne asada and birria tacos! Great chips and salsa too. Overall, we enjoyed everything. We've been twice this week, and I'm sure we'll make one more visit before we leave town."}
{"text":"The best street tacos in town!! Get them loaded steak or chicken I like them both. $1.25 on Tuesdays. Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Bomb! Only critique would be that the quesadillas need more cheese.  But the flavors and salsa make it worth it.  Gonna try extra cheese next time."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. However, the numerous times I have been there, I have yet to experience \"good customer service\". I'm never acknowledged or greeted when I come in. I understand when it's busy and the line is out the door. But when I approach the counter I don't even get a \"hello\". The girls that work there are always extremely rude. They walk away when you approach the counter and they chit chat right in front of the register while you're standing there waiting for them to acknowledge you..Also, the salsa bar is an issue. Your customers already have to stand in line for a congested salsa bar... but when it's busy the staff cuts in and starts cleaning up the salsa bar!! Every time! C'mon guys!!!"}
{"text":"I've heard about this place,  been watching them build one 1/2 mile from my house and been looking for the open sign to come out as I've driven by this place for 3 months.    People have been talking about the one in Mesa...  

Being it just barely opened, It took an hour and a half to get my order.   20 minutes to wait in line, and another hour till number 77 was called for pickup.    

It was worth it.  Wow.  

I don't know what this place has got going on, but they really make delicious food.   Some of the best sit down restaurants don't taste this good.   I got the Carne Asada burrito and it was epic.   The chips and salsa were even delicious.   I think I'm going to eat here, A lot (as soon as the line calms down).   Whatever you're doing, don't stop doing it.    I'm a fan. 

Nicely done Backyard Taco!!!   You're nailing it."}
{"text":"First time here having lunch with my girlfriends. So happy we found you on Yelp!!  I had chips and salsa, along with Carne Asada Tacos. The food is so good! Love the light crispy chips! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"We enjoy the Gilbert Backyard Taco, and thought that we would give dinner at Backyard Taco Mesa a try. Wow, what a difference in locations!

This location is in a rough area of town. It is sparsely lit, with lots of foot traffic in the area. There is no drive-thru here, which was disappointing. The shop itself was small and very busy. I noted that there was outdoor seating in the front, and also on the east side of the building. The parking lot was small, dark and congested. 

The interior was busy, and was a disorderly, hot mess. If it is busy, you will have a hard time walking in. The line goes from the ordering counter out the door. Once you order, there is really nowhere for you to go. So everyone is still standing in the ordering area. This also happens to congest the area in the back corner where folks are trying to get to the salsa bar. 

When it was my turn to order, the gal at the counter walked away. I was not acknowledged, and just stood there like a dummy. A man who struck me as the franchisee or manager asked if I had been helped. I said I had not, and he asked me what I would like to order. However, he just walked over to the girl who had left me in the first place, and told her my order. They squabbled  for a minute over things she had to do first, then she approached the counter. She asked again what I would like. I ordered two al pastor quesadillas, an order of chips and salsa, and two drinks. She then tells me that the card system is down, and she has to write down my card number and charge me later. I should have said no and walked away, but I felt obligated at that point. I asked her about the destruction process once the charge was entered, and she did little to dispel my worries.

My food comes out rather quickly, but no drinks. I tell the gal I had two beverages, and she snaps at me to go to the drink counter and someone can get them. The only person there is the owner/manager guy, who I will say was very personable and took care of my drinks. (Not before asking \"No one got your drinks yet either?\") 

I got home with my food, which was underwhelming. I don't know that I would call it a quesadilla, because I'm pretty sure that there was zero cheese. It was more like a larger sized taco, with fatty al pastor with too many onions and abundant cilantro. But even the cilantro couldn't help this flavorless, ill-cut meat. Also, I'm pretty sure I got the bottom of the chip bowl. I had ONE whole chip and a bunch of small pieces I could eat with a spoon. While it's hard to mess up drinks, and the diet Coke was normal, my Jamaica tasted as if double the powder was put in by mistake...so sweet! I had to transfer cups and add water.

I would not likely visit this Backyard Taco location in the future. And please, cross your fingers for my credit card information's safe and thorough destruction!"}
{"text":"I've had better tacos in Phoenix but this is probably one of the better taco shops in the area. My carne taco was a bit on the dry side and could have used more sauce."}
{"text":"We tried just about everything and it was all so good. But what I was most impressed by was the delicious chicken. On tacos, quesadillas, and tostados. So so good. We took our four kids here and everyone was happy. Including my husband who ate 6 tacos."}
{"text":"First visit tonight and probably last. Ordered tacos, quesadilla and chips with salsa. All looked like it was from the kids menu. Waited 30 minutes, which is fine since they just opened their doors, but the drive through wasn't working and they were still training their staff. 
Salsa bar would have been great if they had the supplies to take it with you, and if it was any good. Guacamole was watery with no flavor. Salsa tasted like straight lemon juice. I had my husband buy a bag of chips on the way home to eat with the bland pico. 
Filibertos is way better"}
{"text":"They truly have some of the BEST tacos and burritos around! I have been twice and both times have been very satisfied with the food. I make the 30 minute drive because the food is JUST that good. The line is usually long, but worth it. I'm just hoping they come closer to me one of these days!"}
{"text":"Awesome carne asada tacos! Some of the best I've ever had. Highly recommend the crazy potato as well. Great fast service! 
Forgot to mention the salsa bar and avocado sauce. A must have."}
{"text":"The food is good the atmosphere is good. It's fresh and the price is right. Vignon Attley located almost in my backyard."}
{"text":"Authentic. Tasty. Simple. Friendly. You can't ask for much more. Papa Loca will blow your mind. True al carbon makes Backyard Taco a CAN'T MISS! Love it."}
{"text":"Excellent food for very good prices.  Carne asada is the choice to get. Chips are fresh and really good. Stuffed potato is something you won't find elsewhere."}
{"text":"Carne Asada Tacos !!!! Yum, fresh !!"}
{"text":"Meh. I found this place mediocre. I asked my husband if he'd ever go back and his response was, \"maybe in a pinch\". 

I had the chicken quesadilla, it was OK. Nothing special. I got it loaded but it didn't come with sour cream. My husband got two steak tacos, also just Ok. I didn't think they had all that much flavor. We ordered chips and salsa and apparently you're supposed to get them right when you order. We had our number called and asked for our chips and salsa and they told us we already got them. Umm no? After my husband argued with the counter staff for a few seconds they finally handed us a bag of cold chips while everyone else had fresh chips in a basket with salsa. We didn't even get the salsa so we used the salsa from the salsa bar. I'm sure it's the same but the cups are much smaller and when you're sharing something a little larger is helpful. Thought this would be our neighborhood spot. I thought wrong. Oh well!"}
{"text":"Believe the hype. This might replace my previous \"Favorite Mexican Place.\" Rumor has it, the owner used to sell tacos out of his backyard. After many of his regulars suggested, he saved up & opened a restaurant, Backyard Taco. 

It's a super humble little place right off of University Drive, in Mesa. I've driven past it dozens of times & each time I thought to myself, \"I bet that place is really good.\" (I have a Sixth Sense that scouts out quality Tacos.) - anyways, there's seating outside & inside. The outside patio has mister to accommodate for warmer days. The inside portion has a cute \"Mexican-country-chic\" vibe. There's about 6? tables that seat 4, a salsa bar, restrooms(duh), & the order/pickup window. Their menu is very simple, and I think that's what makes the food come out consistently above average. The steak they use is marinated impeccably, & there was no fat in any of my 4 Carne Asada tacos. Every single salsa was fresh, & the flavors were on point. *bonus point - I noticed every time a customer walked away from the salsa bar, one of the employees checked & cleaned each condiment for cross-contamination. I've never seen that before, so - kudos!* From the young lady picking up trash in the parking lot, to the cashier, to the chef, every employee was polite & helpful. We were delighted & shocked when our order number was called out. Guesstimating, I think it took maybe 3-4 minutes for 4 carne asada tacos, 1 cheese quesadilla, 1 carne asada burrito, & an order of chips/salsa. I'll go ahead and reiterate that it was well made with quality ingredients. It's safe to say I'm obsessed with Backyard taco. 

P.S. A Yelp check in gets you a freebie!"}
{"text":"The original in Mesa is great. Really disappointed with this location. Food was mushy and sub par. Support the original and pass on this one."}
{"text":"To start off, I was having a good night. I was sitting at a bar and decided to order a carne asada burrito; a friends went to pick it up for me. When I open the burrito and took the first bite I was pretty disappointed to see that my carne asada with chopped into tiny, tiny little pieces. I needed more.. much, much more. I sent for the sriracha... we need a ride, I smother my burrito in it so that I could mask the flavor and look of this horrific bundle of \"goods\". \"Sriracha is the only thing that can save this burrito\" (John Doe). Overall, I give this, out of 10 stars, 60% of 3 stars... it's terrible ."}
{"text":"This place knows what they are doing! Great food, great service and great prices. The salsa bar has tons of options, the atmosphere is fun and bright, and the patio is the perfect place to sit and enjoy your food! I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I have eaten here 4 times and every time I come back I am impressed. I wish there were more locations since it is so busy but it's worth the wait. The carne asada burrito and quesadilla are my favorites but chicken is good as well. The complimentary bar on the side offers a plethora of sides"}
{"text":"Best tacos ever! I love this place. It's always busy but it's worth it. Price is right too. I try to always eat here at least once a week."}
{"text":"Visited this location for the first time today.  Waited about 5 minutes to order and about 5 minutes for the food.  

Excellent!!!

Do not be distracted by the \"uptight\" reviews on here.  We all know what kind of people take 20-25 minutes out of their own day to right something negative on Yelp.  Unfortunately the restaurant is in a very \"stiff\" neighborhood if you know what I mean.

Go here now!!! You will not be disappointed, unless you are one of those..."}
{"text":"Solid.  This was my second visit and it was just as good as my first visit.  Try all 3 tacos if you are into carnivorous choices.  I shall return.  Awesome."}
{"text":"Just finished my first round of street tacos at Backyard.
Normal price 1.89
Taco tuesday special 1.49
I must say the fresh made grilled flour tortillas are the bomb with the carne asada !! Wow!
The smokey flavored salsa is great as well from the salsa bar.
The only problem i see so far is that the cost can add up. 
I can eat 8 street tacos @1.49 and a small drink.... About 14.50
So it does add up!

.....just the smell out in the parking lot will make u nutz!!"}
{"text":"Omgosh! I found a diamond in the rough! A rough as in neighborhood. A diamond as in great food!  I've driven by this little gem so many times and was always a little sketched out by the area. I decided to try it today since it's close to my son's school. It was Fab! We had the carne asada tacos and they were delicious. The salsa was outta this world.  Price was moderate.  We sat and ate outside. It was great! Be sure and try the different salsas at the salsa bar too. They are all so so good ! Yum! Who knew???!!!!"}
{"text":"Second visit here.  The first time was soon after they opened and I thought maybe it was just opening issues... I never cared to try it again but my hubby wanted to try it.  I did not have high expectations and my expectations were met:(  the food is just ok... we ordered quesadillas, tacos and chips/salsa.  The chips were so salty... we asked if there were any other chips but they said they come in a big bag-bummer!  Make your own chips if you are going to charge $2.50.... give free yummy chips instead of the plate of onions and chilis that will go in the trash. 
so disappointed.... and I feel sad for the people who started this- going big ruined it, I guess...
They need a revamp of their menu and process...."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed. My husband and I had high hopes for this little place based on reviews, but it fell pretty short of our expectations. The place is tiny with no room to move around once your order is placed. It was very awkward trying to figure out who was next to order and who was waiting for their order. Also, the place smelled weird. Not like \"oh wow, I can't wait to eat whatever is cooking it smells so good!\" which, in my opinion, is what all restaurants should make you think. My 4 year old requested to go outside because \"he couldn't take the smell anymore\". I went outside to wait with him while my husband stayed behind to place the order, which he said was rushed by the woman behind the counter. 

When my husband brought the food to our table my face must have given away my thoughts because he looked at me in agreeance. We had two shredded beef tacos, one steak and one chicken all on flour tortillas. When asked if we wanted \"everything\" on our tacos, we said no onion. We definitely got no onion; however, the only other thing that was provided was cilantro. No cheese, no lettuce, no sour cream, no guacamole. There was a \"salsa bar\" in the corner with 4 options. The meat had so much \"juice\" that my tortilla was soggy and literally poured out liquid with each bite. There wasn't really any flavor to the meat with the exception of the occasional bite of cilantro. The portions were honestly a joke for the price being charged and was something you'd expect to receive if you ordered from the kids menu. I'm annoyed I didn't think to take pictures before I ate/threw away the food. 

We sat outside because there weren't many seating options inside and the smell wouldn't have made it pleasant even if there were. Thankfully it's \"winter\" so it was not a problem weather wise, but the soda bottle/can recycling bin that sits outside as well had bees swarming around it. We have no desire to return and will continue to look for better Mexican food options.

P.S. Immediately after leaving we drove to Filiberto's to get more food. I think that says it all about our experience at Backyard Taco."}
{"text":"I feel like I definitely know what is/isn't a good taco. The tacos at backyard taco, in my opinion, have gotten worse with time. They were at their best when they were made in the actual backyard many years ago, then they were still pretty good at the Mesa location when it first opened up, then I tried these recently at the new Gilbert location and was not impressed. Way too much smokey flavor and mediocre tortillas. Chips were stale and the salsa tasted very off. I don't think I'd ever go back to the Gilbert location. 2 stars though for the bottled coke and the chairs with the big springs."}
{"text":"The meat is really tasty and the salsas too. Good stuff! Prices are great and staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Wow. Flame grilled meat, wonderful flavors in the tacos. The salsas are all amazing as well, I suspect flame grilled veggies in the salsa. Very delicious. I like the reviewer who said it's like a stationary food truck, because that's exactly what it's like. You order a la carte at the counter. My chicken was dry, yes, but not inedible, and with the salsa I didn't even care, the flavor was amazing!!

I'll definitely go back and definitely recommend it to everyone else.

If you check in, you get free chips and salsa! Woot!!"}
{"text":"Not impressed.  Standard American Mexican food. I don't really see what the hype is about."}
{"text":"The best carne asada tacos in town! Get there early as the line can get long, but they get the orders out quick. The salsa bar is fresh and the meats are cooked over real wood everyday. 
I recommend the quesadilla carne asada."}
{"text":"The atmosphere in this place is great! We came at a busy time with a large work group and were still in and out within the hour! The flavor here is absolutely incredible as well as the service and we will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a joke. The food you get for the price is redic, and the service was horrible. Absolutely NO vegetarian options besides a quesadilla that I could have eaten in one bite. RIP-OFF!!"}
{"text":"OMG! Mexicali style tacos in AZ? YES! I'm originally from Calexico CA  ( located five minutes from Mexicali ( Mexico)... where the Tacos, Chinese Food, and pretty much everything is amazing! :) This place makes me feel like I'm back in Mexicali! I have been searching for more than 10 years for a taco place like this! I love taking my family out to eat at this place! The family pack is only $22 and it feeds 4 very hungry adults. The service is amazing and the lady's preparing the food are super nice and really hard workers!"}
{"text":"I love going back yard taco  ,, has a traditional taco ,,, it is simple but its so delicious,,, i have been there fo many times,, always is busy ,, it shows that every one likes it"}
{"text":"Plenty of seating in doors and out with friendly staff. They had a few problems (I didn't see anyone bussing tables and their lemonade machine went on the fritz while I was ordering) but it seems like a really great place.
I got the carne asada quesadilla, a steak taco on flour tortilla, and a pollo taco on corn tortillas. These are street food style and came on styrofoam picnic plates wrapped in foil. The tacos were good sized but I thought the quesadilla would be a litte larger - however, there were plenty of ingredients stuffed inside. The meat was delicious! Perfectly seasoned. I also loved that the onions/cabbage was minced so you got a lot more flavour with each bite and it was more uniform, instead of big chunks like some places do. The tortillas were really fresh and grilled. No complaints at all about the food. 
I also got a large lemonade \"agua frescas\". To me, aqua frescas is more like a naturally flavoured slushy where this was just fresh juice, but it was still really good and tart. If you like really sweet lemonade, you might have to add some sugar! 

Two tacos, a quesadilla, and a large drink for just over $10. It's street food at sit down prices, but the taste makes it worth it."}
{"text":"Casual little spot with amazing tacos! I come here frequently and I am never disappointed. I love the papa loco (crazy potato) and the al pastor tacos. There have a good variety of tacos, burritos, quesadillas and more. Prices are reasonable. The drive thru line is long but you can go through pretty fast. There is a lot of sitting inside and outside."}
{"text":"A simple, clean taco place that you can take family and friends to.  The food is fine and the staff is nice.
The reviewer (M.S) that said the music is too loud is sadly mistaken; this is NOT a loud place at all.  There is an outdoor patio and it's entertaining to watch the people not know what number is on their ticket..it's used to pick up your food dummy."}
{"text":"Best Street Taco place around.  We've tried just about everything on the menu and all delicious.  We  aren't really fond of the Gordita, {shell was pretty hard}, but everything else has been perfect.  Love the Crazy Potato, makes a nice side with a couple of tacos.  

We have always had good service, but space to wait for food is a little tight if they're busy and the patio is pretty noisy with all the street noise, but you just can't pass up the good tacos for these prices.  Also, love the salsa bar.....always fresh, crisp radishes and cukes.  Order a basket of chips and try the different salsa, etc."}
{"text":"Very good tacos! Fast working. My daughter love them tacos . I recommend this place to everybody!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to eat tacos.  Their food is Oaxaca style.  Don't expect the same menu as Filiberto's.  These guys have their own stile and it is mostly tacos with delicious meats on top.  I would recommend for a medium appetite at least 3 tacos or 2 tacos and a gordita (kind of like a tostada, but a thousand times better!)  They have a great salsa bar.  Don't miss their aguas frescas, especially the horchata.  They also have Mexican sodas, and if you are lucky, you might be able to try their flan (best I've ever had).  Their refried beans are delicious and hard to stop eating."}
{"text":"If you don't get here before 11am, expect waiting a while in line for the amazing food this place has to offer!  Simple menu but great food!  Self serve salsa bar makes the sights and smells worth the wait.  Come on Taco Tuesday for less expensive tacos."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and keep driving to the original Mesa location. I have no idea how they got the experience so wrong here. Great location. Great facility. Nowhere near the quality of food as their Mesa location. I hope they get this fixed soon. We love Backyard taco but this location is.. meh."}
{"text":"Yum! Quick stop for lunch. Tacos so good I went back for more. Very fresh and very good."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service, they always mess up the order and only gave me 2 salsas for 12 tacos!"}
{"text":"The best tacos that I've tried in the Phoenix area. Living in Mesa it's tough to find great quality food but backyard taco is seriously delicious! My favorite is the Carne Asada tacos and the crazy potato. I wish they would add street corn since that's one of my faves! Also don't forget to get their salsas at the bar, they're made fresh and add the perfect flavor to the tacos."}
{"text":"If you live in the East Valley and don't frequent this place your nuts.   Papa Loca and Carne Tacos = Amazing."}
{"text":"The tacos were great. Reminded me of the street tacos you can get... just without the unintended consequences that usually follows. I also got a quesadilla and it was good, though I think it would be difficult to screw up a cheese quesadilla. The salsa bar was nice and even had some guacamole.

The patio area is nice, even in the summer. I think misters were probably god's gift to Phoenix for making this land so unbearably hot. 

I will definitely go back as everything I had was excellent."}
{"text":"We came here for the first time yesterday and these are some of the best tacos we've ever had. We tried the birria, chicken, and carne asada; all were amazing. Definitely coming back and recommending."}
{"text":"Delicious street tacos. Fast and friendly service. Free refills on fountain drinks. Menu choices will not overwhelmed first time visitors. Give it a try when visiting Mesa. Don't forget to check in to get free chips and salsa."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite spot to get \"street tacos\"  the flavor is awesome, super fresh and my meat was perfectly cooked, not dry at all. 

I like how you can see the food being cooked over the hot coals of the mesquite grill right in front of you as you order. 

They have some of the best salsa's I've ever had, I honestly would buy jars of it if they sold it separately. 

It's $1.70 for the typical double corn tortilla \"street taco\", honestly with quality salsa that comes with it, I think that's a very good deal. 

The crazy potato is very interesting, it's a baked potato mixed loaded with what would usually be in the taco, kinda reminds me of the Stuffed Baker from Joe's Real BBQ.  

Honestly though the tacos are where it's at."}
{"text":"Incredible carne asada here. They use a mesquite grill which you can definitely taste and adds so much to the flavor. Many different kinds of meats to choose from as well as a salsa bar with all the toppings you can ask for, like radish, onions, cucumber as well as a few different types of salsa. You obviously can't go wrong with any of the tacos but what really stands out to me is the papa loca. Basically a grilled potato, mashed a bit, and topped with so much deliciousness the head will explode. Service is very quick and the staff is always friendly. Ample seating inside as well as a large patio with misters if it gets too warm out. Overall a great taco spot that I recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Backyard Taco is the spot!! Amazing tacos!! Every time I've been here there is a huge line, well worth the wait. Steak or chicken tacos, you cannot go wrong!!! Very flavorful. Worth what you paid. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Great taco place wish they had a drive thru! Taco Tuesday is a nice idea but it's SO crowded and almost feel some of the quality is compromised (chewy pieces in the meat no good). Otherwise pleasantly surprised to find it close by and will return not on a Tuesday!"}
{"text":"What a great place to eat.  I live just down the street and saw as I passed everyday how crowded it was.  I decided to try it and was not disappointed. The meats are cooked on a grill and have a great flavor.  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Amazing. So good. My son and I love this place so much! Delicious! The service is always friendly. I would come back here more and more but we  loved far away. But we do make the drive just to go there.  Only thing is the lines get a little long so either call ahead for to go or don't be starving when you go you might be waiting a little longer."}
{"text":"I ordered the tacos and they were just ok. Nothing big at all especially for the price and quite small. However, my reason for such a low review was the service. I waited in line behind a family. As soon as the person took their order she walked a way and no one helped me. 
Well....at this point I am hungry and I can't go somewhere else so I went through the drive thru. Because of the service I won't ever recommend this place to someone else."}
{"text":"Great food. Fast service. It would be great to have more places to sit, but it's not a hang out kind of place."}
{"text":"It's hard to find good Mexican Food in Arizona (surprisingly) but this has some amazing food! I love getting their tacos and probably eat here way more than I should! Their carne asada is smoked and has an amazing flavor! They also have a shredded marinated beef which is awesome and their chicken is just as good! They have a salsa bar with fresh salsas and some really have a kick! They also have a crazy potato which I have yet to try but every time I am tempted to! I just can't skip out on the tacos cuz they are that good! Definitely love this place!"}
{"text":"I go there 2-3 times a week, everything on the menu is always fresh, the hot sauce is very good, during its prime time the line is long, but they do a very good job of taking orders and getting them out. Seating can be challenging @ times, but feel free to share the tables with the others."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 or 4 times and love their chicken everything. I have yet to try their burritos. The environment is chill and always busy but the service is good. They need an expansion because they are so worth it."}
{"text":"Best street tacos ever !! My favorite were the chicken and carne asada tacos. The avocado salsa was amazing and so were the beans. Their original salsa is the best salsa ever. 1st timer and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Great service, good food. Saw a pretty woman so that helped like it even better. Want some good food, try it out."}
{"text":"Wow. Where has this place been all my life?!  This place is all about great, fresh food served quickly. Served on styrofoam trays, beautiful tacos, gorditas, folded quesadilla, and crazy potatoes.  We watched the cook grilling huge amounts of steak over a fire grill - a thing of beauty!  

The topper?  Their salsa bar - not huge, but full of great options. Avocado sauce, different freshly made salsas and the best pico ever!  Fresh limes, radish and cucumber.  I'm in heaven!  

There are only a few tables indoors - several tables on their patio with fans.  It's like coming to someone's backyard.  They have a frequent visitor card also.   There are no locations near me, but one is near my sisters house, so I'm going to visit a lot more."}
{"text":"I'm not too sure why people like this place anymore. I give it three stars because it used to be one of my favorite places to get tacos. Also, despite the long lines they tend to get your order out in a timely fashion. It was a good place at first but I'm not sure if they changed their recipes or distributors but the taste has changed and not for the better. I keep seeing other Backyard Tacos opening up in other parts of Arizona and it's usually flooded with people and I am just utterly confused. I've never stopped by but I think I will go to a different location one day to see if there is a change. ¯\_(?)_/¯"}
{"text":"Awesome place, nice and simple menu items, they don't get you confused about what you want to order like many other places do with 100's of choices. The meat is cooked on charcoal ehich is very awesome in my opinion. Very distinctive authentic taste."}
{"text":"After going here more and more often, the less I like it. The food is okay, but the biggest thing is that the prices are really steep and you're going to find way better taco places elsewhere."}
{"text":"The best tacos I've had in my life. As a serious connoisseur of Mexican food and avid traveler (mucho tiempo spent in Mexico) that is saying a lot. The flavor of their meat is unparalleled. Staff is friendly and gracious. Be prepared, the line is out the door, but the wait is worth it. If you call ahead, skip the line and go straight to the front and pick up heaven in a taco."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting and unfortunately I'm not a fan. I usually seek to give good reviews on restaurants and find as many positives as possible but I could not on this one. 

We ordered tacos, quesadillas, beans, and chips & salsa. 

The chicken and carne asada meats were delicious, but the rest of the taco didn't come with much else-just cabbage and a hint of red onion. This was mentioned on the menu. They do offer a salsa bar but it only had pico de gallo and a chipotle-type salsa. 

The chips and salsa come with a thin salsa and a thicker red salsa that is very tasty and these were not found on the salsa bar. It's unfortunate for customers who do not order the chips and salsa as they won't get these variations.

The quesadillas lacked quite a bit. They were basically a version of their tacos but larger. Cheese was certainly an afterthought and barely visible. Very disappointed. 

The beans were probably the worst I've had. Absolutely flavorless.  

The restaurant itself is really nice. It's too bad the food doesn't match the ambiance. At first glance of the menu, the prices seem very cheap but now I know the reason why. The menu is very simple, which I like, but they need to go back to the drawing board on a few things otherwise they won't have customers come back."}
{"text":"Alright here is the deal, well at least my experience. Food was ok at best sent my burrito back because of the copious amount of cilantro on it. Btw order without unless u want a lot on there. So I got the new burrito and it was ok(shredded beef)
As for the atmosphere, I would rather sit in the play area of McDonald's than be here. So many families that either do not care how obnoxious their kids are or are simply oblivious to it. Wow! At one point I had a kid sitting on the wall next to us. Was not our kid. 
Positive note: no chipmunks found here"}
{"text":"I do not understand all the great reviews, because we were sorely disappointed!
First off $2.25 for a small taco with meat only is obscene. Not worth more than a $1.00. I opted for a tostada with shredded beef. Onion and cilantro on the side. Imagine my amazement when it arrived and all that it was was a crispy tortilla,small, with a blob of tasteless shredded beef on top! No tomato, no lettuce and no cheese! And a little plastic plate with some minced red onion and chopped cilantro! And the side of beans were terrible. They should advertise it as bean soup. Tasteless bean soup! It astounded me that the clientele was predominantly Hispanic too! What am I missing here!
Now I don't expect my Mexican food to be hot, I am accustomed to adding my desired degree of heat, but I do expect taste! This place fell so far short of that it is unbelievable! Will never go here again!"}
{"text":"Always amazing food! Can't beat the quick service and great food. I'd eat here every day if I could."}
{"text":"This place was so good! I got the al pastor taco and would definitely come back again! Also their horchata was also delicious"}
{"text":"Totally earned their award for Best Taco Mesa for the last several years in a row. Right as you walk in, this fabulous aroma hits you in the face. The food is delicious. Highly recommend the carne asada quesadilla and any of the tacos. 

Seating inside is a bit limited inside but there is plenty outdoors and several misters to keep it cool and enjoyable. Keeping it on my list."}
{"text":"First check in, you will get free chips and salsa and the salsa is soooo good!

I had a carne asada taco that was really good, and cheap at $1.89. I also had a chicken quesadilla and that was really good as well. I'm looking forward to going back and trying out different items and different meats."}
{"text":"Street tacos are small by definition and I think a little over priced. That being said they are delicious and they do not cut corners."}
{"text":"From a Mexican born in Sonora (best place to eat meat) this is really close to my kind of tacos, except for the fact that they put cheese on the carne asada ones, if I want it that I could order a quesadilla with carne asada or better know as a \"caramelo\" but other than that I like the place, it's nice to have a taco place around in Gilbert, it was really busy when we went but didn't took long to get our order and food. Love the salsa bar, maybe you should just put the cheese there as an option as well as the cabbage."}
{"text":"Very very busy. Long lines very crowded. Very small shop. Don't really dig the whole set up. However with that being said, the food is still pretty damn good.. nothing spectacular, but good. I fell like they need a better organization of the line and a bigger shop. I don't want to be bumping arms with someone trying to pour some hot
Sauce in my little cup."}
{"text":"Always a great taco and service for the night. Always a crowd. Try everything at least once"}
{"text":"Best taco I have eaten. The meats are perfect. Went twice. I would love to go more. The number of seats are limited. So during peak hour, the place gets crowded. they should think of expanding. Overall, a great experience."}
{"text":"Great food and service! It's worth the drive.
Reasonable prices, excellent food and just enough choices. 
Free chips and salsa when you check in.
Coking back often"}
{"text":"Very good and decent tacos. Would recommend the al pastor and carne asada tacos, they are great. They also have a very good and fresh salsa bar."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first time trying this place. It's really good food. They make salsa fresh, and their roasted salsa starts with a batch of tomatoes on the grill sitting over hot mesquite coals. It doesn't get better than that! Their carne asada was slightly on the dry side last night, but I still loved it - you can taste the mesquite smoke, it's just plain good.

I had the stuffed steak quesadilla, it was incredibly good. Again, the meat seemed slightly dry but the flavors and textures were very good for the quesadilla overall.

The aroma surrounding Backyard Taco is wonderful. It's not something I've come to expect out of a typical Mexican Grill, but this place is anything but typical. 

Back to the salsa - you just have to try it! I didn't like the salsa that came with the \"chips and salsa\" order because it tasted like the put tamarindo in it, it just didn't taste very good. However, sitting in the free salsa bar is a roasted medium/hot salsa that will knock your socks off. So good. Give it a whirl. 

A good friend of mine, urging me to go to Backyard Taco, said \"Don't mess around and be an idiot.\" I feel the same way now. Please don't mess around and be an idiot -  Get a carne asada quesadilla (maybe two - and ask for extra cheese), some of that roasted tomato salsa, and a big ole Coke. Tell em Jimmy sent ya. You're welcome."}
{"text":"I was in the Phoenix area for Spring Training and was craving tacos. I knew there would be a lot of great Taco places but I decided to give this one a shot . 

Small private parking lot on the side that wraps to the back of the restaurant . 

Outdoor seating available under a overhang with heat lamps mounted . Table seating inside very minimal . Clean for the most part. I came around dinner time on a weekend and it was starting to get crowded. Walk in, order and wait for them to call your number . Salsa bar to the right of where you order / pick up your food. Person at register was friendly and you could tell people in the kitchen were hustling . 

I ordered tacos (corn or flour tortilla with several meat options ) , quesadilla and free chips / salsa with check in (at the time). Order was quick. I sat outside (more space then inside). Tacos were BOMB! so good and filling . Quesadilla was good along with chips and salsa . Price was decent . 

If you are in the area and want some good tacos fast, come here!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! Very good food! The beans were also very good! 
Service was extremely good even though the place had a line out the door."}
{"text":"The tacos were good but the concept and originality of this spot is great. Quick service, friendly staff small but tasty salsa bar"}
{"text":"The restaurant felt a little chaotic with the long order line running right through the dining area; this required patrons to criss cross for order pickup, drinks, salsa, etc.  Would redesign as we will try to avoid busy times.  We did not receive one of our sides and upon inquiring was met with less than optimal customer service.  Food was good, lots of flavor, but nothing you couldn't find in other places in a calmer setting."}
{"text":"Lady and I came here for the first time and went back three times within the next two weeks. 
Burritos are large - carne :) 
Tacos are like street tacos so you can get a few. The flavors are so intense. How tacos are supposed to be. Recommended to many friends and a few made the drive to Mesa (where I now live) and they loved it. So, it's not just me lol"}
{"text":"My boyfriend told me about this place and we went there for treat since the tacos here do tend to be a little more on the expensive side.  I was extremely pleased with the flavor of the tacos, and the atmosphere was nice too.  They have an inviting patio and an amazing salsa bar- always a plus in my opinion!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Have great street tacos and my friend always gets the baked potato from there!"}
{"text":"Not worth the wait for overpriced, bland tacos. I'll stick to the real thing"}
{"text":"We stopped in after picking my brother up at the airport before heading back yo Peoria, and the staff and food were amazing!  We were very pleasantly surprised.  I would definitely come back again.  I just wish there was one closer to me!"}
{"text":"I am scratching my head trying to understand why people were standing halfway around the building to eat this food. 

The sauces were flavorless and the carne asada was tough and dry. I know it was fresh because it was so busy, so just thinking it's the way they cook it. America's taco shop is much better than this. 

The only thing that tasted decent was the shredded beef. Most in our party felt the same way. I really had high hopes about this place, but to me, there are a million different Mexican food places in AZ that top this place."}
{"text":"decent food nice little place. clean and quick which was nice.   Tacos are best bet for the money."}
{"text":"We rarely venture over to Mesa. And even when doing so, food options seem incredibly limited while browsing through Yelp. Backyard Taco always shows up in searches, but I always feared it would be a situation like up in Anthem, where a place gets glowingly positive reviews, not necessarily because it's good, but because it's the ONLY place available, so the locals simply just don't know any better.

I can confidently say that this definitely isn't the case with Backyard Taco - as their tacos easily made it to our shortlist of some of the best that we've found in our search.

The standout taco is clearly their asada, that has that lovely charcoaled and smoky flavor that I have such a hard time finding in Phoenix. The other tacos, including the al pastor and birria are good, but their asada is clearly the most popular for a reason. The mesquite-grilled approach is a style that I wish more taco places would adopt.

Things can get pretty hectic at times. When the lines get understandably long, you're often cutting through in order to access the salsa bar and might have a difficult time finding seating. But it's never been a significant issue during the handful of times we've visited.

On a side note, I've always been kind of baffled why their second location in Gilbert doesn't receive quite as much praise at the original spot in Mesa. Nevertheless, in terms of cheap tacos, this will always be a favorite choice.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Tried both the carne asada and the chicken.  The meat needs seasoned!  The price is pretty fair given the portion size.  The pico de gallo is really flavorful, but  the other flavors are muted.  If I'm in the neighborhood, I could see going back."}
{"text":"I Love this place for inexpensive Mexican food. You can't go wrong with anything on their menu. I love the carne Asada tacos, chips and salsa, and their bean burrito is the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"I ordered one carne asada taco because I wasn't starving. I wish I was starving because it was delicious and I wanted more. Flour tortillas are my preference. So good. I also got the nachos and they were fine. Nothing special. Next time it's tacos all day for me. Plus only $1.49 on Tuesdays. Can't beat it."}
{"text":"By far the best taco place I have ever eaten prices are reasonable fast service very clean I had carne asada tacos they were great people that work here extremely nice I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"Awesome Mexican hand food. Haven't found a better place in the East Valley yet. Lots of Mormons for some reason. Does anyone know why that is? Nita complaint simply an observation."}
{"text":"I ate here the first time when it was still in the backyard! The food is actually getting better! Do yourself a favor and get a papa loco or two if you're luchador enough!"}
{"text":"Food is great however I am disappointed with the restaurants customer service. They advertise catering services on their Facebook page so I called and asked about catering an event that I was having. Gave all the information they needed and they said they will call me back with a week for price estimates. I was thrilled that I was going to have their great tacos at my event yet they never called me back. Thanks a lot."}
{"text":"This is got to be the best taco place ever. They are quick beer festival is a Kendrick and food is just superb. The salsa is great the spiciness is appropriate I would recommend it for anybody anytime everywhere."}
{"text":"I really, reeeally wanted to love this place. I love a good taco joint, and this one is fairly close to my house. But alas, it was just ok, bordering on bad. 

We came here and ordered a carne asada taco, chicken taco, carne asada quesadilla, 2 bean and cheese burritos, 2 drinks, and chips and beans. The total came to $30. 

The food came out fairly quickly, but when I went to pick it up at the counter, there was a carne asada burrito instead of a quesadilla. I pointed it out and they remade it quickly, but stupid me didn't check the receipt until after we left. They charged me for a burrito instead of a quesadilla, which meant I paid several dollars more for the meal than I should have. The kid handing out food should have pointed out that the order was taken wrong (since he knew what it read), so I could have gotten a refund of the difference. Strike one.

The salsa bar looked really good, so I got a little bit of everything to try out. I LOVE a good salsa, so I was excited to try them all. Sadly, they were all extremely mediocre. Some of them had a bit of a kick to them, but they were completely lacking in actual flavor. I was super disappointed there. The chips and dip we got were also incredibly mediocre. For $4 you get a basket of chips that taste like they came from a bag and about a cup of the same (extremely runny) refried beans that they use in their burritos with some cheese sprinkled on top. The beans themselves were also strangely lacking in flavor. The cheese was good, though. Strike two.

Now, the tacos. The carne asada taco was super dry and (you guessed it!) bland. I dumped a bunch of salsa, their really runny guac, and lime on it to try to give it more flavor and make it less dry. It only slightly improved the experience. The chicken taco was less dry and bland, but it still required copious amounts of \"stuff\" to make it taste like anything. The quesadilla was not so much a quesadilla, but a large taco with cheese melted in the bottom. My 6 year old son picked out the carne asada in the quesadilla, but that was it. The burritos were probably the best part (but that's not saying much). The cheese was the redeeming factor, but the beans were so runny that it was hard to keep the burritos from falling apart. Like I said before, the beans themselves were pretty flavorless, but the cheese added a bit of flavor. Strike three.

All in all, the only really good part of this experience was the tortillas. They were super good! I have no idea if this was an off day were they forgot to season ALL of the food they served today or what, but overall we were super disappointed."}
{"text":"Authentic street tacos. They cook fresh meat right here on the grill. Traditional Mexican garnishments. We will definitely be back. I had the chicken tacos, my husband had the chicken burrito. Both were great."}
{"text":"Great tacos!  Very nice atmosphere.  Took awhile for our food.  Prices are ok.  Will visit again during off peak hours though."}
{"text":"It's obvious this place needs to get their service and training down.  I'm  sure they have been overwhelmed by the amazing response to opening in Gilbert.  The restaurant looks great, is big and clean. Even though the  service I received was a \"1\", I'm giving them an overall \"4\" because the food was on point!  The Carne Asada was delicious and they do not skimp.  Their tostada was the bomb and the salsas hit the spot.  We'll be back fo sho hopefully they will iron out all the kinks in their disjointed service. If you are patient and light on the judgement, and you love Mexican Food, you gotta try this place out."}
{"text":"I am going to make this review simple! I am so proud of the family owners that have a part of the American Dream! THIS PLACE BY FAR, IS THE BEST AT WHAT THEY DO!!! SIMPLE MENU, LIKE IN-N-OUT! KEEP IT SIMPLE, AND YOU WILL GO FAR!!! If you do not try this place, YOU ARE CRAZY!!! Thank you for bringing us your craft here in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I was excited to come in and try the tacos after hearing wonderful things on tv about them, and come to find out, they weren't bad but they were also very pricey for the size and amount of food you actually get! i'm a little disappointed, but would go back."}
{"text":"Check them out, We stopped in for a late night snack, the menu is simple and straight to the point. We grabbed a couple of Carne Asada and Chicken tacos to go and both hit the spot. Flavorful and fresh tasting."}
{"text":"Amazing tacos in a nice building with covered patio. The grill they have is really intense and cool. Horchata and jamaica drinks are really good. Birria tacos are really good."}
{"text":"I ususally find Yelp reviews to be a pretty good indicator of quality.  This is not one of those times.  It cost approximately  $10 for a taco and a potato.  They were both ok, but nothing I would ever order again.  The marketing is top notch however.  They have a great logo, and the sign out front is appealing.  That is about it."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for tacos, this is the place. Their carne asada is delicious because you can really get that \"off the grill\" taste. My favorite thing here is their carne asada-crazy potato. It's basically a baked potato with taco fillings. They also have a good variety of salsa and condiments on the side such as pico de gallo and cucumbers. I personally mix the pico, green salsa and a bit of lime juice in my crazy potato to create the perfect flavor and heat, but to each their own. I also like that you get free chips and salsa every time you check in so I put a little bit of that in my crazy potato as well. They have Coke by the glass bottle and delicious horchata as well. 

Quick tip: come before dinner time (~6pm) if you want to dine in because it does get crowded and you might have to sit outside in the cold/hot weather that AZ has to offer."}
{"text":"Birria tacos are super juicy and the asada is always great.. If this place was closer to my house I would be there every other day"}
{"text":"Definitely check this place out! As a native, I know a good taco and burrito when I taste one. This place hits  the spot with few exceptions!

Options are good enough, although other places might offer you more meat options. I love that they give you the option to have \"everything\" on your item or not. I chose to have everything on what we tried (plus some extras!)

We got a carne asada burrito, and one steak taco, one chicken taco, and one shredded beef taco. Wonderful  flavor and balance of flavors!

Our critique is: the meat was overcooked. Chewy, not burnt, but a lot more chewy and tough than your typical taco and burrito. It makes sense, since they cook the meat in front of you over an open flame.

Also, the side bar could have sooo many more options. I've been to places that have twice the size of sides to choose from, like cheese, salsa, etc.

Regardless, this place is a great option! Wonderful service and flavor!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch today. Ordered a carne Asada and chicken taco. The interior was clean with clean tables ready to go. The street tacos arrived quickly garnished with diced cabbage and onions.  Of the three salsas, the green avacado was fantastic, tasting light and fresh. The chicken had a mild flavor. I prefer a much bolder grill flavor. The Carne Asada had a slight marinade/rub flavor with an excellent char to it.  When I return, I will definitely order more of the carne asada."}
{"text":"Too many flies buzzing around, really disgusting, they need to invest in a system like a gardner light trap.  I have eaten at places outside of the USA with less flies than this.  Beyond that the meat was barely lukewarm on my tacos, and rubbery and flavorless, I was really expecting a nice charcoal grill flavor on that meat but nope.  Tortillas were tough and very hard to enjoy almost like cardboard .  I had high hopes for this place, maybe it was better back in the day, but really a huge let down.  No flavor, no heat just bland."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat tacos literally started in someone's backyard at one point time and has grown into several locations with the best street tacos and drinks available in the market congrats to the Entrepreneurs who got this bad boy going and kudos for their success I hope to see you all over the state one-day!"}
{"text":"I can't say the food wasn't good it just is a little overrated. The service was very slow."}
{"text":"We came here because Mucha Lucha was closed. I wanted to like it, but honestly couldn't get past how unsatisfied I was. I got a carne asada burrito that was overpriced considering how small it was. I was mostly bummed about how much flavor the meat lacked. Didn't even taste like there was salt and pepper. The salsa bar was my only hope and that failed me too. I would go to Filibertos over this place. Sucha bummer."}
{"text":"Taco Bell. (No. I'm not comparing this place to Taco Bell. I wouldn't do that. This wouldn't be a five star review if I did something that stupid.)

It was a Friday night and my wife and kids wanted Taco Bell. No, they're not classy people. In the interest of finding a Taco Bell worthy of my hard earned dollars, I searched for the Taco Bell with the highest rating in the Mesa area. In a most serendipitous of circumstances, Yelp provided me with a listing for Backyard Taco.

Five stars and over 1000 reviews. I had to try it.

I opted for a carne asada taco, al pastor taco, carne asada quesadilla, and an al pastor quesadilla. I am not exaggerating when I say that my love for Backyard Taco grew exponentially with each bite I took of these delicious tacos and quesadillas. The carne asada had the right amount of texture and flavor. 

Backyard Taco did not disappoint. Sure, the line to order was 20 people deep at 5:45pm on a Friday, but that only added to my anticipation. 

Also, being able to look past the registers and see the carne asade being grilled before my eyes and watching the al pastor spin on a spit is a nice touch. 

If you want street tacos and stuffed quesadillas, do yourself a favor. Don't go to Taco Bell.

P.S. In my excitement of eating at Backyard Taco, I forgot to buy my family dinner. I had to run through a Taco Bell drive thru on my way home. BACKYARD TACO IS SO GOOD IT MADE ME FORGET ABOUT MY FAMILY."}
{"text":"As of a review on how awesome this place is lol just go here and eat it's kinda cheap but omega delicious"}
{"text":"Okay so I finally tried this place after all my friend said the mesa one was amazing. I'm not taking stars away because of the wait thats a given with any new restaurant, even tho it did take an hour to get food. I think the whole set up is nice, love the patio but that's about it. The food Blew me away I was so disappointed, yes it is cheap I believe about 2.50 a taco but that's why because the quality of meat is not there, chicken was the worst of all of them the steak was so thin an over cooked felt like I was eating crumbled bacon. And they have no alcoholic beverages to help pass the time for the extremely long wait. All in all I was let down from all the hype. I've had WAY better for only a dollar more a taco LOL I think ill stick to that. THANKS!"}
{"text":"Great tacos for a very affordable price. Try the Carne Asada!"}
{"text":"No, just no.  This is not \"real\" Mexican street tacos.  It's also way overpriced.  Sorry but when your place is full of Gringos located where it is, I should have known then it wasn't authentic.  But I went and ordered food any way.  My suggestion is you go to Taquitos Jalisco on Broadway between Extension and Alma School and you will find much tastier food and it's cheaper."}
{"text":"First time at the new Backyard Taco in Gilbert. They have a drive-thru and much more seating inside. They also have more patio seating. The parking lot is bigger, but we had to look hard for a spot to park.  We were there during the Memorial Day weekend so maybe it's normally not so busy.

For how busy it was, it didn't take long to find a spot or get our food. The food is just as good as the original location in Mesa. Even though this location is further from home, we'll drive a little farther for the possibility of better seating and parking."}
{"text":"This place is good! I had the crazy taco. Like someone said before... CRAZY GOOD!
go here!

There's not really a kids menu but they chowed down on plain chicken tacos and beans. I wish they made rice. Thats my only suggestion for improvement."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to go, but I liked it for it's salsas and atmosphere. The tortillas were cold upon arrival, and flaky. 

It needs better seating.
Bathrooms are clean.
Music is good for the ambiance."}
{"text":"1) the patio is amazing. I love outdoor patio restaurants and this one is 100% shaded with fans 


2) Get the crazy potatoe thingy with carne Asada, you're soul will thank you later

3) They have a Drive thru and they are open late

I rank 4 stars because I didn't like their quality of meat"}
{"text":"My wife and I went on the day after it opened so it was very busy and we waited an hour for hour food.  That was not too bad considering we had about 60 orders ahead of hours after we placed our order. The outdoor seating is really nice and the whole restaurant feels really open. 
We ordered carne asada and chicken tacos, a carne asada quesadilla, and a bean and cheese gordita.  Everything was good. I was a little underwhelmed by the chicken taco but the carne asada taco more than made up for it. So delicious!  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great food!

Price is ok!

Fast service!

Authentic!

Tasty.....

Will recommend  to anyone"}
{"text":"It was good and definitely closer than my usual boarder taco place. My picky 10 year old found something to eat! That right there is a plus. 

The only issue I have is parking. Omg parking the the Higgly Rd place is a nightmare! Please just park down the street and walk there. The parking is why I only gave 4 stars. After being stuck in a parking space for 30 min before some nice person going to the drive through let me out."}
{"text":"Very good tacos especially the pastor and chicken!! 4 stars because Mucha Lucha taco shop is down the street and that place gets my 5"}
{"text":"Yum! Nice atmosphere and decor. This is what a taco joint should be!!!! Service is super fast! I had the chips and salsa along with the carna asade burrito. This thing was packed with steak!!!! Good food at a good price. If I lived near this place the burrito comas would ensure..."}
{"text":"We tried the other location in Mesa and it was good but the Gilbert location is much closer. The food is just as good, love the chicken burros at both places but this location is my new go to place due to size, location and the place is very clean. Employees are very friendly and salsa bar is really great. try it when you get a chance."}
{"text":"Very good food. We went there as a family of 8 and they had a table outside. It would have been bad but they had the misters going and it was nice. I can tell you that they give you quite a bit of food and it's all very good. There was not anything left on out table to eat[ sorry birds] If you have not tried this place, you're missing out. Chicken Burro is Greaaaaat!!!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good for the most part. Clean restaurant and good environment. Parking lot is really small and busy which is very annoying when your just trying to grab some taco's on lunch. I took a look at my receipt after noticing the line items + tax didn't add up to the amount I was charged (I was over charged), same with 4 friends. It was only .50 over however if that happened to us 4, I wonder how many more people this happened to. I spoke with a manager who said it was for the cheese (seriously? cheese on the tacos is an extra charge??) I asked why I wasn't told cheese is an extra charge or why it didn't appear so on my receipt and he said it must have been a glitch in the system and compensated me with a voucher for 1 free taco."}
{"text":"OMG, I knew that there'd be some bomb Mexican good in Arizona, but Backyard Taco just took it to a whole new level. LEGIT.

We received this recommendation from one of our bartenders over on Roosevelt as we were exploring Phoenix. Fortunately, my friend lives in Mesa, so we made a pit-stop to grab what our bartender called \"the best tacos ever.\"

She was right. Oh damn, was she ever right.

Backyard was absolutely fantastic. You walk in, place an order, and wait for your number to be called. From tacos to gorditas, there were plenty of options and lots of sizzling meat grilling right before your eyes. We both opted for carne asada on everything, and I added another pollo tostada to complete my meal. As you wait, you go and take over the sauce bar and fill your small containers with all the salsa, guac, or gallo you'd want.

Oh, and a Check-In on Yelp snags you complimentary chips and salsa.

Twenty minutes later when we got home with our food and Coronas, we took our first few bites of taco heaven. Mmm... the carne asada was grilled to perfection, and the flavors blended so well with all of the condiments and salsas on top. My pollo tostada was also fantastic. The chicken was tender and was packed with spices.

As for those chips we got? Light and crispy! The salsa that came with it held out on its own. Amazing and delicious.

Our only regret was not ordering more. Everything was so good and affordable that we could've easily gotten five more tacos each. But alas, having it every so often will help me keep my high each time I go and enjoy this amazing place.

Highly recommend for anyone visiting Phoenix and locals alike."}
{"text":"Best food ever!!! Love the salsa bar. Totally worth waiting in line. Staff is always friendly and fast. Clean inside and out and always fresh food."}
{"text":"This is such a great taco place! I really liked the original mesa location but did not go there very often. Came here for dinner and it wasn't very crowded and we did not have to wait very long. I got a carne asada quesadilla and would definitely recommend it. My husbands burrito was FULL of carne asada and I think it looked like it could have used more of the other toppings. Their cabbage and onion toppings are great, so make sure not to remove those the first time you order. My mom got a bean and cheese burrito and that looked very good as well! I enjoyed my meal and will probably come back."}
{"text":"We have a goal to try a new restaurant at least once a month, Backyard Taco is one of those places on our list.  I had heard good things so it was nice to finally try them.  I ordered two tacos, a Carne Asada and a Birria (which the poor girl at the register had to pronounce three times for me and I still butchered it).  I enjoyed the carne much more than the birria, we got our food to go and the birria taco was fairly soggy by the time we got to our food.  I've never seen cabbage chopped so small, it was more than diced - it was microscopic.  The tacos were both over flowing with meat.  Bae ordered the Carne Quesadilla which strangely had no cheese in it.  Not sure if that is intentional, but not sure you can call it a \"Quesa\"dilla without the cheese.  It was more like a giant smashed taco.  The meat was also in abundance so he had no complaints there.  We tried each of the salsas at the salsa bar and really only like 3 of the 5.  The restaurant was not very busy which was a main reason we stopped since usually the line is out the door.  Our food was done so fast we were still deciding on what salsa to get from the salsa bar.  AND our order was under $10.  Can't beat that.  I will definitely be coming back to try the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Oh this place is the best!  Most amazing chicken and carne asada.  You'll typically wait in line - but it moves quick and is sooooo worth it."}
{"text":"Love! love! love this place. The hubby & I eat here atleast once a week. I promise if your visiting from out of town, or an AZ local looking for some delicious Mexican food.. you will be doing yourself a favor. Backyard Taco is doing something right & you gotta try it. The carnasada Taco is our favorite but you can't go wrong, so far anything we have tried has been fantastic! Stop reading reviews & trust me.. just go to backyard Taco."}
{"text":"Backyard Taco, what kind of magic or crack hath you bestowed upon your Carne Asada? 

Whatever it is, it's enough to make me drive all the way from North Chandler to fulfill a craving. 

Please ignore the symphony of gunshots as you roll up and a child choking incident on the patio like our first visit this summer.

Besides, I'm from Modesto, you don't scare me. ;) 

Just get in line.  You're in for a real treat. 

This place is very humble and totally adorable; limited indoor seating with the most excellent enclosed outdoor patio. Simple, clean metal tables and chairs. 

Also, can we talk about how clean the place is? Even during peak service times, someone is always hustling to clear away debris on tables or keeping that salsa bar spill and splatter free.

The menu is very simple, which is perfect. Think Tacos, Burritos, Gorditas, Quesadillas, and the Papa Loca (crazy potato, have yet to indulge, next up). 

So far, we've tried:

1) Tacos (Carne Asada, Birria, Pollo) - Never shorted on meat. 

2) Freaking MASSIVE Burrito (Carne Asada, duh) 

3) Quesadilla (I'm going to let you guess what meat!) - Surprisingly not a lot of cheese, which as someone with legit dairy sensitivities, I can get rocked with that!

When you walk in, you see the Carne Asada being cooked over mesquite chips, and ho lee WHACK that first bite is like hearing the Hallelujah Chorus - Tastebud Orgasm - Yeup, they exist! 

Just the right amount of seasoning, never tough, and you can't miss those mesquite notes.

Burrito, Taco, Quesadilla, whatever you choose, you will NOT be disappointed. 

And the afforementioned salsa bar is incredible. 

Especially the Birria, Tametada and Jalapeño ones; sweet Lawd the Birria one brought tears to my eyes with how hot it was on one particular visit. 

We've gotten out for under $13 with a Burrito, Quesadilla and a Drink.  

Incredibly affordable. Take THAT overpriced and under-delicious sit down Mexican joints!

Don't forget to check in for a free order of Chips and Salsa; the perfect compliment to your feast.

If the story about this place is true, I would TOTALLY follow the owner into someone's backyard just to get a shred of his culinary delights. 

Backyard Taco is the real deal. Make moves and plan your visit, mi gente!"}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. Usually very busy, especially on a Tuesday (Taco Tuesday). However, the food is amazing and makes you feel like you are at a taco shop in Rocky Point. They have the best carne asada tacos!! Then you get all the toppings you want, guac., limes, radishes, salsas, cucumbers, it's SO good!"}
{"text":"It's alright. Based on other reviews, I was expecting much more. The service was slow and the staff was not very friendly. The food was good, but I've had better. It's worth a stop if you're in the neighborhood and hungry, but it's not something worth going out of your way to get it."}
{"text":"Another positive taco experience.   Love the casual atmosphere almost as much as the food.   The local citrus is in full bloom  and it smells great for outdoor seating.  I have a few days off work and I came here to feel like I'm in CA close to the ocean.  Enjoy the weather while you can!"}
{"text":"Really wish I didn't have to give this review but just a heads up, they do NOT tell you their food is spicy. I asked them and they told me it isn't. I pulled all these jalapeños out of my first few bites of my chicken burrito. One of the jalapeños is bigger than my fingernail. I decided to just throw it away because my stomach can not handle the heat. What a waist of $8."}
{"text":"I absolutely love backyard taco...been eating the incredible food made by the owners for many years now and their carne asada tacos are some of the best in the world. nothing more to say then tasty, yummy, goodness!!!"}
{"text":"I am so excited BYT is back, this place is good.  The reasons I am rating it 3 stars is because the portions are small.  I would suggest ordering a quesadilla.  Both the Carne Asada and Chicken meat are good. The Place is really clean and good looking inside."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place. Great food and and great vibe. Friendly staff and cool decor. The food has a very flavorful and fresh taste. We took our food to go. The food traveled well. The authentic taste and fresh ingredients were a pleasant and most refreshing take on tacos. I will be coming back for more."}
{"text":"Omg these are the best carne asada tacos in Mesa, Az I have had. I have had many tacos in Az & Mexico and these are pretty darn good! I rather eat here then a fancy restaurant. They put a good size of meat on each tacos plus they have a free salsa bar with pico de gallo, avocado salsa, green salsa, red salsa, cucumbers, and jalapeños. A good combination with the carne asada tacos is a horchata drink. I also like to get their quesadilla with carne asada inside. They have seating inside and out which are clean."}
{"text":"They won 2015 Best of Mesa for tacos. Tacos are great, small, grilled right there where you can see. Burritos very good. White cheese quesadillas. Small place, but in & outside seating. Line goes quick. Not my favorite street tacos,  meat can be a tad tough sometimes."}
{"text":"By far the closest I have found to Mexico street tacos!! Meat has that crisp texture and the salsa bar has all the fixings! Wash it down with a hecho en Mexico bottle of fanta"}
{"text":"Don't go to this place starving and expect your food in 25 minutes or less.  I been here twice and both experiences not impressed.  I went there yesterday and it took 25 minutes to get just two Quesadillas and they barely had any cheese in them.  I asked to speak to the manager and he/she had me waiting another 5 minutes to where I didn't even bother and left.  WILL NOT BE BACK EVER AGAIN!  I can get better food and service at Filiberto's or Los Favs's and cheaper.  It's overrated.  If I could I'd give half a star I would."}
{"text":"Get take out, there's not much seating. Food was affordable and delicious! So glad there's some place great to grab a quick bite near by. I just wish they had drive through..."}
{"text":"Just left from my first visit with some friends! It was so good. I love the free salsa and guac bar. All of the employees were attentive and answered any questions we had. Food was great and it's a definitely a new hangout spot. Generous amount of food for how cheap it is also."}
{"text":"I love Backyard Taco! I used to be a customer when they were still in the backyard of the house over by Stapley.  I just wish they had a bigger place and parking lot (or a second location!).  The place can get packed at peak times.  All three meats for the taco are great and full of flavor.  They're cheap enough that if you can't make up your mind, you can just buy all three."}
{"text":"The wife and i just finished our dinner from here....IT WAS THE BEST DAMN FOOD WE HAVE HAD IN A LONG LONG TIME. We ordered the papa loca carne asada, a carne asada quesadilla, two carne asada tacos de maize and a carne asada burrito. Each and every one was just as delicious as the next, we plan on going back to try everything else left in the menu....can't wait."}
{"text":"Backyard Taco's Crazy Potato is amazing and the best part is when you put it in your mouth and begin chewing!"}
{"text":"Not impressed, not sure what all the hype is about. It was edible but the taco and tostada that my husband and I both had lacked flavor and were small. The guacamole at the salsa bar was runny and had no flavor it was more like a sauce then a guacamole."}
{"text":"I have a weakness for tacos... luckily Backyard  Taco is literally in my backyard! All the tacos are delish! The chicken had a very smoky taste that is different than your average chicken taco it's like a mesquite flavor and the shredded beef is so flavorful. And who couldn't love carne Asada super juice and full of flavor... they are all my favorites. During lunch there is always a line out the door but it's worth the wait and their drive thru just opened for faster service . They have a good variety of salsas too.. I don't understand their quesadillas since they look like a taco not a standard quesadilla but still yummy."}
{"text":"I'm amongst the crowd that doesn't see the fascination in this place. I waited weeks after the initial opening to try it out and was glad I did...because if I had waited in one of the lines that stretched around the building for this food I would have been even more disappointed. 

I can visit a place one time and know whether or not I'd ever return within a few minutes of being there. This is a spot I'll never need to try again. Food just wasn't for me and was terrible. 

On top of the lack luster food, we asked that our check be split on two cards. Everything looked normal in the store but when checking our bank accounts later we were each charged our appropriate halves and then I was charged the full price as well. So I payed twice as much as I should have for food I disliked. Called and asked to speak to a manager and was told by the girl who answered she was the closest thing there was. I knew then I wouldn't get anywhere so I told her I'd call back. I never did as I just chalked it up to a loss."}
{"text":"This place was extremely busy and the wait was long, which is fine, they probably have amazing tacos but we will never know. . . I ordered 4 chicken tacos to go and chips & beans. When I got home I opened 4 super greasy steak tacos. Literally the grease was dripping out of the foil into the bag. I checked the receipt and they also double charged me for the chips & beans. My girlfriend doesn't eat red meat so I called to let them know about their mistake. The woman on the phone interrupted me and took a customer's order while I was talking. She didn't ask me to hold or excuse herself. There was no resolution offered, just an empty apology. The tacos went in the garbage and they can have the extra money because I won't be going back, not even for a refund."}
{"text":"The Al Pastor tacos and tostadas were wonderful. The tacos are VERY small, be aware more like street tacos. We tried chicken, shredded beef and steak, all were good but the al pastor, (grilled Pork)  was the BEST."}
{"text":"WOW, went there with high hopes, but sadly let down.
1. menu doesn't say whats in the food beside what kinda meat.
2. if u want lemonade/horcheta/jamaica it's $1 more & no refill's? On lemonade? I can understand the other 2 (not really tho) but cheapo lemonade?
3. they give u your chips/salsa right away BUT NOT THE BEANS, my theory is they know u will eat all the chips with the little salsa cup (which by the way u can get FREE at their condiments bar) so that way u will have to order more chips (again $1) when they give u the beans with your order (moreno's gives u all the good stuff upfront!)
4. Food was awful tasting, I drowned mine in vinegar/onions just to finish. The beans we ordered for the chips tasted a bit like coffee?!?! Salsa was almost watery ketchup, and just the taste was bitter & really really bad.
we had each type of taco, chicken burrito, chicken quesadilla.... nothing good im sad to report
even my daughters quesadilla had a bunch of chopped up nonsense in it (cabbage?) I really couldnt even identify what it was.
OMG and the \"green watery stuff\" called \"plain guac\" at the cond. bar... WHY?!?!?!
Your $$ would be MUCH better spent eating Chipotle."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great customer service. Good drinks and al pastor and carne Assad's tacos taste amazing."}
{"text":"My fiancé has been wanting to try this place. So we came on a Thursday night, around 6ish. There was a long line, the guy behind us was talking to his friend saying there's about an hour wait. Since we're already there, mine as well just try it. When we got to the cashier to place our order the girl warned us that the wait would be an hour, we still placed our order anyway. The clock was ticking, people were patiently waiting for their orders & so we did. We we're munchin on our chips & salsa while waiting, 55 mins later they finally called our number & got our food. The steak tacos we're pretty good! They have salsa bar with good salsa, pico de gallo, cucumber & pickled onion. I need to come here during Tuesdays, I heard they have happy hour & cheap tacos!"}
{"text":"Like mesquite grilled meat? Fast service? A salsa bar? Then look no further! Backyard Taco offers chicken and beef grilled \"al carbon\" AKA over coals right in the kitchen as your order. The smell of mesquite is quite distinctive and you can catch the aromatic smokiness right when you enter the restaurant.

There was a fairly steady line on a Saturday afternoon but it moved quickly and my meal was made quicker than I could fill up on the salsa bar. I had the carne asada papa loca and a chicken burrito. Both had smoky grilled flavor, with plentiful toppings. They were both hearty portions. While I like the uniqueness of being served smashed baked potatoes with meat, cheese, and vegetables, I liked the taste of the burrito more. 

The salsa bar has several salsas, pickled onions, limes, and a very puree'd, runny looking guacamole. I wasn't really a fan of the guacamole, but I did like the various options for topping your meal.

The parking lot is a bit small but I had no problem finding a spot. I can imagine though at busier times it might be a problem finding space.

There aren't many spots for dine in either, so if you are coming at a very busy time take out is probably the way to go.

Each item I got was a little under $7. Overall, I liked the grilled flavor of the meat and if I'm in the area I'd go here again."}
{"text":"Literally the best news I got last week was learning the new location of backyard taco opened up in Gilbert. Backyard has essentially five different flavors in my view. They package these different flavors in a few different ways, tacos, quesadillas, etc, which may sound a little boring. But I assure you those 5 flavors are outstanding... just exceptional. So for instance the steak taco and the steak quesadilla are very close in taste...  but wow, both are very very good.  I love to get a bean and cheese burrito and steak quesadilla... it's the best."}
{"text":"I just so don't get the hype around this place. The only thing I even sort of like is the crazy potato but the last two times I've been I've even been disappointed in that. The only reason I've been a few times is because my husband used to like it alright and it's close to our house but last time was the last time we'll be going. We both we just disappointed one too many times. The two stars is just because they did such a good job designing the place and they have glass bottle sodas that are of course delish. I'm glad they're having success, but it's not our cup of tea."}
{"text":"Delicious authentic Mexican food. The restaurant is clean and has great ambiance as well. My husband is from Mexico and is extremely picky about his food and he loved backyard!"}
{"text":"Wow! What a great local find! Noticed this little place going in a few months ago. I have been there twice in two days. The food is super fresh and the salsas are great. The carne asada is on point, the chicken is tender. Authentic Mexican street tacos and gorditas. Try it, it won't disappoint"}
{"text":"Another stop on my Taco Mission while visiting in Arizona! I did my research to find some of the best tacos and this place was definitely delicious! I tried steak, shredded beef and the chicken, the shredded beef was my favorite and the hot sauce they had was very good! There was a long wait and lots of people, but hey that must mean it's good right?!"}
{"text":"Love the tacos, the bean burritos not quite for me, but the potato bowl is excellent.  service is fast and very friendly.  Parking is a bit hard, and being on University Ave at 5:00 it is busy.  worth the stop,"}
{"text":"Love this new location. It's bigger than it appears. The outdoor seating is great-- complete with fans & misters. So it's comfortable even on a hot AZ day! The carne asada tacos were great. My friend ordered the Pastore tacos & I'm definitely getting those next time. The meat was awesome. The staff was friendly and helpful. And our food was done promptly!! I love the salsa bar and all the options!! Any place with FREE guacamole deserves five stars!"}
{"text":"Best tacos in the valley!! No more having to travel to centeral PHX to get authentic Mexican food! Horchata is delicious as well"}
{"text":"The driest most unflavored carne asada I've ever had. I don't think they even marinate the meat at all."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good, and I'm glad to have another place to eat at in North Mesa. The staff is friendly and I like that is a small local business. The chicken quesadilla and carne asada potato were delicious!  I will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"This place is so good. We get the family taco meal and it serves as dinner, steak and eggs and lunch tacos. Good deal"}
{"text":"These are the best replication of Mexican dollar taco's on the East side.  Good asada, pollo, or Al pastor taco's cooked on a charcoal grill.  Salsa bar is great too"}
{"text":"Tried this place because I was in the area. What a nice Taco place with a unique taste on their tacos.  Ordered the Carne Asada tacos one on flour and one on corn tortilla so I could taste the difference.  I really enjoyed the taste of the beef, and really does taste like steak I made in my backyard grill.  The mesquite flavor is awesome. The only improvement would be not to make the meat well done. The beef is over-cooked but still tastes really good. Would give this place 4.5 stars easily.  The staff was friendly and the restroom appeared to be recently renovated and clean.  

I also tried the chicken tacos which were good too. I would recommend the carne Asada tacos over the chicken. Each Taco is $1.89 and only sold a la Carte. 

Will return again . Thx. BTW. Lemonade was tasty"}
{"text":"Best, authentic tacos! The meat tastes so good and I like all the toppings they have."}
{"text":"Went here with my brother and his wife. She's from Sonora, Mexico and knows the real thing. Look no further. This is it!  Fresh flavorful and inexpensive. Over the top good no-frills Mexican street food.  OVERALL: OUTSTANDING. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."}
{"text":"I enjoyed most of my lunch.  Service was excellent and small line moved quickly.   Chips and salsa were given at time of order and food came out fast.  I enjoyed the birria taco, but would not have the cheese quesadilla again.  Salsa bar was fun."}
{"text":"Well, as you might already know from the other reviews, this place is awesome! The food is excellent. The pastor tacos are excellent, so is the chicken, and carne asada...did not order birria so cannot vote on that one but one could only assume it would be equally amazing! 
I must let you all know something...get the Papa Loca! It is Stupid good. The tortillas are good, the salsas are good, the service is great but the darn Papa Loca is THE BEST on the menu. 

Upon walking in, or should I stay, standing in line outside waiting to get in. The anticipation starts. It's like \"give me my food! NOW!\" You want it, bad. It all there right in front of you like a candy store...just have to wait your turn. The best thing about killer food is when they only have four meats on the menu and four ways to order them (love that). That is a wise, strong call for \"we got the best, don't need random hipster crap to fill a menu\" :)

The place was beyond packed, the wait time was rather quick considering though. I wish they had one of these set up more like 'sit at bar, enjoy a Mexican beer and kill six tacos' places in addition to this awesome place. For now, this place is holding the bar really high for every other taco shop though. Keep it up there Backyard Taco, great job, great everything :)

PAPA LOCA!!!!"}
{"text":"I must like it because I've gone back several times - they grill the chicken and beef for their tacos and burritos over a wood fire, which gives it great flavor and they have a nice selection of house made salsas, going from mild to spicy, to go with the food. They have always been busy when  I  have been there and seem to be a favorite of people in the area - for an authentic taste of local Latin American cuisine it is definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Yes please! Very authentic flavors, I'm from san diego... reminded me of tacos el Gordo a little bit. I'll be back for more!!!!"}
{"text":"Thank you for opening this location! Have been going to the Mesa location for years and never been disappointed! By far he best street taco place around.  No competition here."}
{"text":"A girlfriend of mine told me about this place and I'm so glad o tried it out, the tacos are sooo good. You walk in and small the meat cooking.  They were fairly busy during lunch, but they move very quickly.  And the salsa bar is AMAZING!! Will definitely be back to try other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Warning: not open on Sundays. That was our first attempt to try Backyard Taco only to find they are closed all day Sunday. The parking lot is small and once the other business in the same complex open will be limited parking since this was the only place open so far and the parking lot was full. Street tacos were good and l liked the salsa bar."}
{"text":"The best food...I love the flavor of all the meats. The crowd is diverse so it has a broad appeal. It doesn't serve alcohol nor is it open Sundays. Go at an off peak time because the place is small and it gets quite packed."}
{"text":"A Mexican food restaurant that actually serves real Mexican food! I AM IN HEAVEN!!! They have Birria, refried beans (the delicious kind) corn tortillas...... everything for authentic Mexican food. This new space is Gilbert is wonderful, its pretty big, nice and open and decorated really neat. They have outside seating and a huge salsa bar in the center. Everyone was really nice and our food came out super quick. This is my 3rd day in a row eating here...... I cant stop!!!! Everything is cooked on a huge grill right behind the counter and the smell is fantastic as soon as you walk in you can taste it in the air! LOL! The steak I wish they served in bigger chunks instead of the tiny bits, but it is still good and they pack the taco with meat, it has a lot of flavor. The Birria was amazing!!! Fantastic flavor! I recommend that before anything else. Get in my belly!!!! Note to self if you keep eating like this you will need to go to the gym twice a day!"}
{"text":"Great little place in Mesa! They cook their meats right up front behind the cashiers, so the smoke gets a little much at times, but they keep it ventilated as best as they can. Decent prices, meat taste really good, great refried beans and yummy salsa. Over all 4 1/2 stars. Make sure you stop by between normal lunch and dinner times because it gets pretty busy!"}
{"text":"Chips and salsa were delicious. The steak was better than the chicken taco I had. Great salsa bar!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Saturday.  The line was out the door but went quick for just being opened for the first week.  Service was great and restaurant had great ambience with a nice patio.  Loved the salsa bar! Ordered pretty much one of everything off the menu.  Gave this place 4 stars only because we ordered the chips and salsa and I felt like they can do better.  The chips were like plain chips you can get at the store but the salsa was amazing.  All in all, great place and lives up to the hype.  Definitely will be a regular customer."}
{"text":"I eat at Backyard Taco for lunch today and had delicious beans, tacos and chips. I accidentally left my backpack containing my wallet, money, credit cards ... around 1:30 pm. I didn't discover it missing till 5:30. They had found it and put it away for me! I was so happy that nothing was missing! Love Backyard Taco"}
{"text":"Great street tacos had a few Al Pastore, also tried a carne asada burrito everything was great. sauces were good, price is a little expensive for street tacos but still  worth it. Will definitely go again"}
{"text":"So glad this location opened closer to home. Food is consistent with the other location. The salsa bar is much easier to access here, and much more seating. It's busy( as I write this, they just opened about a week ago) so there will be a wait for food as they get into their groove. We waited about 30 minutes tonight. Chicken tacos are worth it! The pico is addicting."}
{"text":"The Mexican food is a little too authentic for me. Im too Americanized! I need cheese and sour cream. Everyone else I know loves it here. It's a super clean restaurant and fun to sit on the patio. Good luck keeping the flies away if you sit out there."}
{"text":"Great food at a good price and prepared quickly. I have been there multiple times and always great!"}
{"text":"Simple and simply outrageous. Street tacos extraordinaire. The Carne Asada was incredible. The meat take char and texture from the charcoal grill. Combined with some cabbage and salsa, it was taco perfection. The birria was succulent and not far behind. Good (Great!) honest food."}
{"text":"Love this place! Found it looking for tacos similar to Ta'carbon on the west side and this is almost exactly like it! Highly recommend if you're looking for authentic tacos on the east side!"}
{"text":"I only know about this place because it's across the street from my dentist. I came by after work and there were just a couple of people dining inside when I came in. I perused the menu and decided to try a chicken gordita and carne asada taco, with horchata to wash it all down. The food didn't take too long to come out and I took it to go. I like that they plated the food and wrapped it with foil, easy to dive in. The gordita wasn't what I incorrectly imagined, but it was really good. Both the chicken and the steak were very soft and flavorful, though I have to say I preferred the chicken. I will definitely be back to explore their menu, plus the price is very reasonable."}
{"text":"Best authentic mexican food around! Love the atmoshphere, too."}
{"text":"Was a little disappointed with the carne asada taco. The meat was dry. However, the chicken taco was delicious. Really liked the outdoor seating. I love the salsa bar. Did not like the salsa that came with the chips. It had a vinegar taste to it, that did mix well with the other salsa flavors. I would recommend this place only on Taco Tuesday!"}
{"text":"Great taco Tuesday. Fantastic prices. Loved the vibe. The good itself was delicious. The flavors went well together. The salsa bar was great. Lots of variety and good flavors. Would come back again for TACO Tuesday"}
{"text":"The tacos here are great! Sometimes they do taste a bit bland and I suspect that the meat has been out for a while before being served. That being said, I still come here every once in a while to satisfy my taco Tuesday cravings."}
{"text":"Yummy tacos. The wait is worth the wait even on taco Tuesday. Been going here since opening day and will continue to do so"}
{"text":"Decent tacos,  nothing special.  I've tried everything on the menu.  Price is right,  food is consistently solid.  Service friendly.  But I have no Idea why they have lines. Surprisingly I enjoyed the chicken more than the carne asada.  The salsa is good.  Stick to the tacos I wouldn't go for other things on limited menu.  I do applaud them for the limited menu, they have their niche and stick to it."}
{"text":"I can't rave enough about the carne asada tacos. They are supreme! Having a traditional salsa bar is also top notch. Love this place."}
{"text":"This one is on my top 10 for tacos in the Phoenix area. They cook their meats for each order, and their tortillas are made fresh there too.  They have a great salsa bar, I suggest you try them all.  If you are really in a fun mood order a loco potato. They take a baked potato and stuff it full of meat and toppings, they are a meal. But if you order the tacos I would order 3 to cover your hunger."}
{"text":"One of my favorite taco shops in the Mesa,Az area. Great portion sizes, and everything is very scrumptious! Besides eating about 6 Carne Asada tacos to myself with a large Horchata (1.79$ taco tuesdays! ), you should defiantly check out the Crazy Potato!"}
{"text":"You need to try this place .  We frequented the Mesa location and love the food, especially the carne asada tacos!!! This location is much bigger and customer friendly and the food is 100% the same.  I have spoken with the owner at both locations, great dude, great food, great customer service."}
{"text":"This is a great place for us because its a rare place that I can agree on with my wife, daughter, and both of my parents - its rare to find a place that all 5 of us like.  The crazy potato is amazing and that is what my dad normally gets, I typically get the carne asada burrito, and my wife, daughter, and mom get the tacos - then we split a chips and salsa and a refried beans. The food gets 5 stars and the service does too.  The owner is often there and I've chatted with him a few times, he is a really nice guy.  The only reason I don't give 5 stars is because the place is small and busy, it can be difficult to find indoor seating, and sometimes seating at all.  Also, the condiment area is often crowded and inefficient due to its location in the corner but there isn't anywhere else to put it in this small place.  The parking lot is crowded too, this place needs to either open another restaurant (further south and east please) or move into a bigger location.  But the food really is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"best damn tacos in the universe- now they just need to add delivery."}
{"text":"This place is amazing best tacos around the flavor of their grilled meats are so good. Always packed glad they finally are opening new locations must try if you haven't already"}
{"text":"Love this place street tacos are to die for the steak is perfectly flavored and cooked I just say be prepared for a line on Tuesdays for taco Tuesday other than that it's a cute lil place clean and good"}
{"text":"Incredible Mexican food. Small simple menu but so tasty. Every first timer I bring there, loves it."}
{"text":"This restaurant has it going on! Good food, great service, awesome customer base; definitely a place you'll want to eat at."}
{"text":"Best place in Mesa for tacos! Seating is limited and they are always busy (for obvious reasons, the food is amazing!!), but we've been during lunch rush and have always found a place to sit. The food is phenomenal, always fresh and delicious. I love the open kitchen, the place has a fun vibe and the food can't be beat."}
{"text":"Food here is delicious, my mouth is watering just thinking about it. The carne has a really good flavor cooked fresh off the grill. The owner is really nice and even gave me a free backyard taco t-shirt! Love this place for lunch or dinner, Yumm!"}
{"text":"I love backyard taco for their family feast! It is the best deal and it feeds my family of 4 nicely. Plus then everyone puts what they want on their taco so it satisfies even my pickiest eater."}
{"text":"Best thing ever!! Food service music people! Smell! Salsa!!!  It made me feel i was enjoying some tacos on Mexico!  Love it love it!"}
{"text":"Best tasting meats in the area!!! It was crowded but they are fast and its worth it. If you've never eaten here, they will give samples of the meats. Be prepared to eat after you get the samples. With the burritos, you get meat on the FIRST bite!!!"}
{"text":"We went there last Saturday morning after reading the reviews and it was awesome. I got the chorizo burrito with a waffle on the side and both were wonderful. The burrito was so big that I could only finish half and took the rest home."}
{"text":"I went there because the smell driving past there was so enticing I couldn't NOT. I've not been back - it was just ok. Maybe I just don't like grilled meat tacos?"}
{"text":"I really like the food the only reason it is not five stars is because it still takes quite a bit of time to get your food.  I won't go between 430-730p.
I've never had an issue with customer service nor bad attitudes. Taco Tuesday everyday!"}
{"text":"Our family does not eat out often (I love cooking), but we stopped in at this place one day to get some grub.  It was delicious!  The people were friendly, atmosphere was cool, and (most importantly) the food was great.  Even my son loved it (and that is saying a lot about my kiddo).  We have since revisited to grab take out and we had the same great experience and fantastic quality.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The horchata is pretty good! I love the Gilbert location. It is really clean and open. This is such a fun place to visit in the winter because it is fun to sit outside. I got the quesadilla, with chicken. I have to say it is a really tiny quesadilla so definitely get two if you are hungry."}
{"text":"This is my favorite street taco place to go. Do yourself a favor and check it out. Everything is so fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"A bit expensive for one taco...$2.50, but their salsa bar is amazing! If you plan it right, you could get a whole salad for free with this salsa bar. Ambience is just right, makes you feel like sitting in a small Mexican neighborhood with loud traffic nearby. Great for 2-3 people at a time, larger families or groups need not stop by..."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, what a gem. The food is excellent, and they really get a lot of people through the door. They cook the meat right behind the counter over a flame. It can get really crowded, so if you plan to go, leave early."}
{"text":"I love this place! Being Mexican myself, its very hard to find a really good, non chain Mexican restaurant that is not so overpriced and have very good food. I definitely recommend this place if anyone wants authentic Mexican tacos."}
{"text":"showed up around closing the manager said to come in he will take are order and serve us after closing time. We were hungry and he helped us with are order and let us dine in on the patio. The food was awesome and we did not feel rushed thumbs up Backyard Taco"}
{"text":"If you want fast, no-nonsense tacos, you've come to the right place.  Even though the food comes out quickly, they do not compromise authenticity for speed.  It's not a very extensive menu, but expect to be full and satisfied.  The dining area is really small with limited seating (although there is a patio area with misters) so I would suggest taking the food home to enjoy.  A solid experience."}
{"text":"Good food.  Pleasantly surprised. I loved the street Tacos!  The counter help seemed annoyed explaining what items were, but the menu didn't.  So guess what? It's your job!  Even tho it was Saturday and pretty busy, food was ready quickly.  Yummy!"}
{"text":"My brother recommended for our group dinner, so I checked out the website; seemed authentic so good food would be had. I called ahead to pick up a to-go order. Or I should say, tried to order over the phone. They answered, put me on hold, and never came back. I hung up 5 minutes later because I was already at the restaurant. I called ahead b/c I had two hungry kids in my car and was just trying to minimize the time it would take to get the food in their mouths. After I ordered, I saw the cook tell the cashier that he didn't give her a heads up on an order, so apparently they had to start over. that order was mine, and it took awhile to remedy, as two other families got served before my order was ready. While waiting, I saw the cashier pick up tongs to flip the meat (no gloves) and I think he burned his arm reaching across the grill. Doesn't come across as sanitary when the guy handling dirty money is also cooking. The salsa bar did look expansive and I scooped 4 different options for us, but if this is a typical experience, it's not worth it for me. Only gets the third star because the food was tasty."}
{"text":"We love both locations, so glad it's closer to us and can't wait for that drive through to open!!! 
We are huge fans of the chicken and stake tacos. We also love the crazy potato! 
This is our first go to for friends and family visiting! 
Love the new places location, it's large and lots more room to sit. The new decor is awesome! Super friendly service every time, and fast!"}
{"text":"First time trying it while on Vacation. Fast friendly and food was delicious.. try a Gordita soft it was amazing"}
{"text":"I'm kind of a taco snob. I've eaten a lot tacos and know a good taco when I taste one. This place is good for the East Valley, but doesn't even come close to Ta Carbon in the West Valley. But since Ta Carbon is so flipping far from this location, this will do. 

I had the tacos in every meat combo: asada, chicken, and birria. Meats were juicy and had good flavor. They had flour and corn tortilla options and the tacos were topped with finely chopped cabbage, red onion, and cilantro. They are street taco sized so get a few. I got 3 and it was the perfect amount.

The salsa bar is decent. They have cucumber and radish slices, lime, avocado salsa, jalapeño salsa, pico de gallo, and a spicy salsa for the birria. They had a few other salsas I didn't try out.

Price wise, you get bang for your buck. The tacos are $1.89 each and Taco Tuesdays they are $1.49 each from 2-10.

They have agua frescas and their jamaica was on point. Overall, they get a 3 from me as it didn't blow me away but I will most likely return because I do love cheap tacos."}
{"text":"Great food! Ate at the restaurant and took food home for later! I read a lot about people loving the crazy potato but I wasn't that impressed with it. Carne Asada tacos were the best though. Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"Every Juan loves tacos and so do we!  The carnitas is the best ever, bar none. The long line is worth the wait because you get to savor the delightful aromas from the sizzling grill and you get to watch the grill master. Wow what a concept......"}
{"text":"I can't believe I was missing out on this delish taco stand.. worth the drive to Mesa for these tasty tacos!! 

They clearly have a following.. diverse crowd was patiently waiting in line during a busy lunch rush. 

Beautifully seasoned carne asada, chicken & birria tacos.. fresh salsa and sliced cucumbers & radishes .. Jamaica and horchata to wash it all down! 

You will not be disappointed, the staff here keeps the line moving, the orders come out of the kitchen quick, salsa bar is full of yummy options and tables are wiped down and made ready for the next customer.."}
{"text":"This place is incredible! The crazy potato is by far the best thing on the menu. I would definitely hit this place again if I was in Mesa!"}
{"text":"This is supposedly one of the best taco places in the Phoenix/Mesa area, so obviously we had to give it a try. It's really good! I have had better, but this place is a solid 4 star place! The food was good, service was quick and efficient. The salsa bar was nice. Very pleasant, casual setting. The chips weren't the best I've had, many of them were crushed and they weren't the freshest, but other than that we enjoyed the place."}
{"text":"We tried the food here based on the recommendation of a friend and after seeing the reviews on Yelp and Google I knew it had to be great!

There were four in our group and we came at 1:00pm on a Sat. It was packed! There wasn't a lot of parking, so we felt lucky when someone pulled out of a spot right when we turned into the lot.

The smell of smoked meat hits you as soon as you get out of the car. It smelled like we were at a BBQ joint and not a Mexican restaurant. It smelled like some really good smoked meats were waiting to be eaten!

Then there was the wait... We waited in line for close to 30 minutes! I realize this restaurant is highly rated and has a loyal following but that line moved REALLY slow! And because the place is SO small and not laid out well, people are walking in front of you and behind you the whole time you're in line. If you're someone who doesn't like people in your personal space (like me), then turn around if you see a long line here.

After we ordered we waited another 10-12 minutes for them to call our number. I highly recommend getting your salsa while your food is being prepared. I wish I would have thought of that because there was another long line for the salsa. I waited another 10-12 minutes for salsa and when it was finally my turn, the green salsa was completely out and it was way too loud and busy to get any of the employees' attention. 

By the time I finally got to sit down and eat I was irritated and thinking this would have to be the best Mexican food I've ever had to go through all of that waiting. It wasn't! In fact, after having to go wait in line for salsa for so long, my food was barely warm when I got back. 

We decided between the four of us we would try everything on the menu. The food was good and I would say better than most of the competition (Filiberto's and most of the local taco joints). On this particular day, having to wait about 45 minutes from the time I arrived to eat and then the food not being very warm by the time I ate, there was no way this place seemed like it deserved the high ratings. And it was a bit pricey for a tiny place in the older part of Mesa. For my wife and I, we ordered four tacos, a Gordita, a burrito and two large drinks and it was almost $30! The burrito was large and the lemonade was good. The Gordita, which seemed more like a Tostada, was overpriced and so were the tiny tacos. (Except people seem to have all accepted paying $2.00 - $2.50 for street tacos these days). The other two people in our party who have lived in the area a lot longer than we have (35 years vs 11 years), said it wasn't as good we hyped it up to be).

When we left at 2:00, there was no line at all! So maybe we'll come back another time when it's not as busy and see if the hot food and shorter lines can make it a better experience. For now, it just seems like yet another place in the Valley with a really high rating on Yelp that doesn't deserve it."}
{"text":"The street Tacos are truly amazing, the service is good as well, and I love the seating outdoors as well as indoors.  With that said though, parking is slightly limited, their website is down, and they don't respond to yelp messages (only reason I gave them 4 stars to b e honest).  Obviously those are important, but at the end of it all, the food is really good, the service is great, but there is always room for improvement especially when it comes to internet based customer service :-D"}
{"text":"Best tacos ever! Literally. Small place and always busy but I promise you it's worth it!"}
{"text":"I don't normally write a review after going to a restaurant only once, but in the case of backyard tacos I had to! These tacos are the most authentic I have ever had, and so flavorful! And the hot sauce I would pour over everything! If you come here, they will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Delicious as usual!!! Carne asada quesadilla, chicken burrito, and carne asada tacos!!!"}
{"text":"Environment: Went in doing lunch hour. The place is pretty crowded and the line was out the door. That was a good sign of good food. Aside from the restaurant being a bit smaller, the environment was good. 

Price: Everything was reasonably priced. I ordered a carne asada burrito ($7.95) and a bean and cheese burrito ($4.25) and they were delicious. The carne asada burrito was filled (I mean FILLED) with carne asada. The burrito was very filling and their medium drink was charged ($1.95) which was reasonable. 

Food: There's no complaints on the food quality or the quantity. You get exactly what you pay for. I'm not a big fan of Mexican dishes but if I have to eat at a Mexican restaurant, this would be my Go-to place. 

Service: There wasn't much service. However, she lady at the register was polite and patient. She listed all the ingredients of the burrito when asked. You get a number for the order and you'll go up and pick up your order when it's ready. 

Overall: Price = Great ; Food = Great. 10/10 would recommend others to try it."}
{"text":"If I'm in the area and have the time, this is the place for a carne asada burrito. Great salsa taste and the horchata even better!!"}
{"text":"Mucho gustoso! El burrito the asada 
Las mejores salsas que he probado. El lugart esta muy clean"}
{"text":"Slow to review here. But because I've been eating tacos. I have been going to Backyard Taco since the week they opened up. I am fortunate enough to work within walking distance. They have a friendly, helpful staff. The food is fantastic. All proteins and veggies are fired over a huge charcoal grill. The owners care about your experience and it shows. I love the Carne Asada Tacos and Tostadas. I suggest going weekdays around 11 or after 2. From 11:30-2 they can get pretty packed and it's not a big place. Anytime you go, it will be worth the wait, though. 

Ohh yeah...ask grill onions and peppers when you pick up the food. You have to ask."}
{"text":"Their carne Asada is the best in town! They also have a salsa bar with all the fixings. Truly authentic Mexican tacos! They have a cute outdoor patio and it is usually very clean and orderly. There is always a line because the food is delicious and absolutely worth the short wait."}
{"text":"Checked this joint out today.
\"All & all, I would say it's just ok\"!
Kinda pricey. Street Tacos are $2.25 each.
Place was pretty busy at 2:00 PM. Our food took awhile (4 small tacos) & a side of refried beans.
They offer complementary grilled onions & grilled jalapeños with your meal. \"Yes, please\"!
Nice salsa bar- just wished they'd offer hot carrots.
The Carne Asada was average in flavor: however the Al Pastor was quite good! 
The refried beans were somewhat discouraging. Very bland. Had to add salsa & some of my grilled Jalapeño to give it some kick. Definitely lacked on the taste buds! 
We purchased the 4 tacos & the side ( No DRINKS) it was over $14. Disappointed in the portion size that is served on a small styrofoam plate! 
I don't think I'd consider experiencing this place again; unless it was for a burrito, that looked a little more appealing for the price."}
{"text":"I hope people know about the original location in Mesa thats been open for awhile. I love the Mesa location a lot better. The atmosphere over there seems more like your neighborhood taco shop than this location.

Other than that, the tacos are always good. 
I think a lot of people on here are basic and like super Americanize tacos."}
{"text":"I guess it's ok. The chicken and carne asada weren't as flavorful as I wanted but cute place and it was very busy."}
{"text":"Bummer.
I waited forever for this place to open. The husband doesn't eat mexican food so on this rare occasion when he wanted to try some, I jumped at the chance to finally go. They were CLOSED. On a Sunday. Waaaaah.
 A couple days later, we try again and there's a line out the door. We were too hungry to wait but we decided it must be some pretty epic grub. Couple days later, we try again.
This time they are open and not much of a line so we finally gave them a shot.
Meh.
As a Gilbert resident myself, I'm convinced that people in Gilbert will eat anywhere they've been led to believe is trendy, no matter how bad the food is. (Looking at you, Snooze) 
Taco with teeny crunchy bits of overcooked \"beef?\", check. Quesadilla with too much cheese (I know, I didnt think it was possible,  either) check. Rice?..... Rice?..... Nope. No. Rice. The hell? 
Really let down, but this place will do fine with the gringos, because they are not the slightest bit authentic. 

If anyone needs me, I'll be at Filibertos."}
{"text":"Solid food. It's a little pricy, but we will super close and love going to this place. It's not the best mexican food ever, but it gets the job done on the way home from work."}
{"text":"The El Pastor tacos are delicious! We stopped by on a Tuesday not realizing it was taco Tuesday and since they offer a deal on the tacos it was very busy! Seating is limited but the tacos are totally worth it!"}
{"text":"So excited to finally have them this side of the 60!!! We've driven the miles for years for this one of a kind taste! Such a simple menu yet exploding with flavor on all tacos, burros and salsas! You can't go wrong! Love this place!"}
{"text":"The line is ridiculously long most the time. Food is a bit over priced. No OG street tacos w onions and cilantro. Not all that overall."}
{"text":"When you want flavor and more authentic Mexican food come here it is the best in the area!!!   The tacos and out of this world!"}
{"text":"Problem with this place is the prices are so high for the amount of food you get.  I had two beef tacos for lunch that were good but not to the tune of the price.  Very limited meat and lots of cilantro on small flour tortillas.
They do a good salsa bar with a really nice guacamole salsa.  Will try again in a few weeks and see if it was me or them."}
{"text":"I just ordered the grossest carne asada tostada I have EVER had.   Thank goodness it was minuscule.
How can they stay in business if their other food is as bad.  Bland, boring and just not what I thought it would be.
Who ever heard of 'no cheese' - we'll put cabbage on it instead.
Service:  the dark haired girl never took my order from outside ordering post... Very unapproachable.  Bye Bye Backyard Tostada..."}
{"text":"One of the best taco joints ever! Just go and get one taco of each kind."}
{"text":"Not a favorite. I really wanted to make this a regular spot for my Mexican food cravings .. but the portions are too small for the price and there is isn't very many options. It was new when I went last and was way too crowded and seemed like they were slow to get the food out."}
{"text":"We went for taco Tuesday and loved it! Super affordable and flavorful! The outdoor seating was perfect with the nice weather. We are excited to come back for more tacos and tostadas!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry, i really wanted to like this place but the food was horrible.

I bought dinner for 3 and none of us liked it.

The flan had a cottage cheese texture that just ruined it.

The only saving grace was the bean and cheese burrito was ok.

$46 for a family of 3 and i will never eat there again."}
{"text":"Back when they were still serving out of backyards, I got my wife, who is from Texas and is picky about Mexican food, to admit they were the best tacos she's had in Arizona. You won't regret a trip here."}
{"text":"Awesome tacos - I highly recommend the carne asada.  Quesadillas are good too, but there isn't much of a taste-difference.  We also tried a burrito, but it wasn't that impressive at all.  The beans were good, but I probably wouldn't order them again.  

Indoor seating is very limited, so avoid peak times if you are trying to sit inside.  Parking is also a bit of a challenge at times.  

Overall, this is a tasty little lunch spot. You can't really go wrong with what you order.  My biggest complaint is the FLIES inside.  Eat a taco in one hand and swat flies with the other."}
{"text":"These were the best tacos on the east side that I've had. Very authentic and inexpensive. Nice people and the place is very clean. The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as I don't like it puréed. I like it chunky. But that is no bug deal. I HIGHLY recommend people to try this place."}
{"text":"Love the Mesa location.... but this one isn't as good. Got the carne asada crazy potato and it was terrible. No flavor and not good at all. They had the heaters on on the patio and it was 75 degrees out, so everyone was sweating out there and wondering why they were on. Just not an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time tonight and it was awesome! We each had the carne asada tacos and split a carne asada quesadilla,  It was all excellent as was the salsa. 
The crowd was a good mix of collage kids, couples and Mexican families. It was a nice if not quiet setting, when it cools down it will be nice to sit on the patio. 
We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I went for the first time a couple weeks ago to check it out as I had heard a lot of great things about it. I thought the food was good. The salsa bar was great. I would not consider my favorite taco place, but would return. The restaurant was loud and busy."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best place ever for Mexican food!  We live in Avondale, and every time we are in Mesa, we love to eat here.  The prices are very reasonable, and the service and food are awesome!  We wish they would expand, and build one in the West Valley!  Everything on the menu is amazing, you can't go wrong, great atmosphere, too!"}
{"text":"Love it!  High quality, street tacos, quesadillas, burritos.  carne asada burrito with beans and sour cream is wicked good! The meat is so flavorful.   The patio is cute and cozy.  Fast, cheap, delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! The carne asada tacos are the best!! Come on Tuesdays for better deals! All of the food is authentic and delicious!"}
{"text":"No secret, this place is awesome. Great food, good service. It is a bit cramped from the parking lot to the dining room, but worth it."}
{"text":"Love this place! Their Carne Asada Family Pack fills up our little family! Only complaint is that they're closed on Sundays! And La Papa Loca is definitely my LOs favorite!"}
{"text":"Love backyard taco.  The line was out the door, but was expected with the popularity of the other restaurant in Mesa and the Grand Opening.  Definately worth the wait!  We purchased 2 family packs for my family of 6 and had plenty of left overs.  Glad this one is closer to home so I don't need to make the trek to Mesa!  As with a new staff, I am sure the wait times will improve - but you can always count on Excellent food!

I will be back, and often..."}
{"text":"The food is really good and the price is good as well. I absolutely love the patio at night! Quick service and great atmosphere. We'll be back real soon!  Thanks backyard tacos!"}
{"text":"Tyler as a business owner you need to invest in courses on professionalism, leadership, and anger management.  Your reckless response to my review just solidifies my thoughts on this business.  I was not being dramatic when I said that we spit out the food.  It literally tasted rotten.  Maybe it was just our order as I know multiple people that do like your place.   Before your childish response to my review I would have told people that we didn't like the food but I know many people that do so they should try it.  I sincerely hope you were just having a really bad day!"}
{"text":"The food may be great here but this is the slowest \"supposed to be fast food\" restaurant I have ever been to in my life. I got here at 6:20 and now it's 7:30 and still haven't gotten my food when all I ordered was 3 tacos!!! They need to do something about the wait times."}
{"text":"Most authentic tacos you could ask for! We go here once a week for taco Tuesday and it's always packed with a line running out the door. Only thing bad here is their salsa bar is way to small."}
{"text":"This is such a great place for great food! I just wish the place was a little bigger!"}
{"text":"I had heard nothing but praise for Backyard Taco, however the food I ordered was bland and lacked any real flavor aside from the beans. Very disappointing and do not think I'll be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"Whenever my co-workers and I get a chance to be near Backyard Taco, we make sure to make a stop at this place! I love the grilled veggies and their Carne Asada street tacos are great and flavorful."}
{"text":"We went to check this place out to see what the hype was all about. And we were disappointed! We bought every single meat taco they had and nothing raised our brows. The horchata was good. The cashiers were kinda rude and not really helpful. I understand it is very busy, but lets keep a good attitude people. This place was recommended by my sister and her boyfriend. I will not be influenced by her again."}
{"text":"I really liked this place, it was recommended by a friend who lives out in Mesa, and I happened to be in the area. We ordered carne asada burritos, and didn't wait no more than 5 min to get our food. The burritos were really good. I'll definitely have to go back."}
{"text":"This small building has much to offer! The menu has a variety of choices without overwhelming the customer. The prices are very competitive. The service is friendly and fast. Even though the building can hardly hold the line of customers, the patio is spacious and comfortable - even in the AZ summer! The food is delicious. I hope to return soon!"}
{"text":"I've been to this establishment twice and both times it has been really busy but I get my food in a timely fashion, the burritos are good"}
{"text":"This place is on point.  Fresh, large portions, obviously fresh, awesome customer service.  

The family in Mesa tonight grabbing quick bite.  Way more than I expected.   The 6 of us are sold... Tues night and packed like it was the weekend. 
Gave our family a free flan..  
Thank you!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"They literally screw up our order every time we go here. I think I'm done with this location. The food quality is always changing too- sometimes great, sometimes just meh."}
{"text":"My daughter and husband love this place so I had to try it. Ate here a few days ago and was very impressed!!
Had 2 shredded beef tacos they were delish!! The food is very fresh!! Will be going back soon."}
{"text":"This place is so good!! Everything is so flavorful. Tacos are the best.  And the Papa loca bomb..."}
{"text":"Does the carne asada always taste like lighter fluid, or was I just lucky enough to catch this place on an off night?  I had a taco of every kind, a carne asada quesadilla, and chips/salsa.  None of it was worth the hype.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"The food was really good. They treated me with kindness and prompt service despite me coming in 20 mins before closing. I will return again. Chips were good and the variety of taco choices was excellent."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos, nice people and the take home kit (by the pound) is an excellent value when we need a quick dinner. I wish the location was a bit bigger, the parking lot fills up as does the seating areas. I love the idea of the patio, but do not feel safe sitting that close to speeding traffic with my family. Excellent food!"}
{"text":"Would be a 4 and 1/2 if Yelp would get with the program. The only reason it's not a five was the flour tortillas tasted like store bought not the homemade kind that should go with street tacos. The meat was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The cabbage is cut in tiny chunks that made the taco for me. The red sauce is good but the salsa they offer for free to put on the tacos is excellent with the perfect amount of hot.   

Went back and the street tacos were perfect, tortilla and all."}
{"text":"These were some of the best tacos I've ever had!  And we went on Taco Tuesday and by 6:30, the place was packed with a line out the door.  Amazing food!  Highly recommended the steak tacos and pastor tacos.  So good!"}
{"text":"What a great surprise.  Ordered the carne asada quesadilla and a taco.   Both were perfect. No cilantro at all (cilantro is the devil).  Both came dressed with cabbage and some onion.  

Normally I'm not sure about a places salsa.  I tried both and both were fantastic with a perfect spice."}
{"text":"The carne asada quesadilla is really good, delicious cheese and meat wrapped in a flower tortilla. I didn't think much of the chicken taco, pass on that one. The birria salsa they have at the salsa bar has some kick!"}
{"text":"I had six tacos. 3 chicken. 3 carne asada. And a large horchats. I have no regrets. Amazing food.  Great service."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place because I love having good Mesa restaurants!  I love the neighborhood feel and the staff is nice enough.  My biggest issue with this place is the rubbery meat.  I do like their bean burro and the chips and salsa. I just wish I liked the tacos!"}
{"text":"Backyard Taco has excellent carne asada and chicken. I love that they cook it over an open flame in view of the customers.  Their prices are okay. Their family pack meal is the best deal. If you go during lunch make sure you have plenty of time because the lines can get very long. The food is very good and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Ok here we go, everyone said this is the taco spot and right by my house. Came in on a Monday for lunch and it was slow. The price is decent not too expensive. $2.25 a taco.

We ordered: 

4 Carne asada taco - salty 
1 Chicken taco - alright 
2 Burria taco - awesome 
1 Crazy potatoes (steak) - awesome 
1 Chicken quesadilla  - alright 
1 Loaded steak quesadilla - good 

There was pastor on their paper menu but not on their board menu. They said not for another month when we asked about the pastor. 

The condiment station was cool had all the stuff you would need for your tacos like pico, cucumber, pickled red onions and all the typical hot sauces however the level of spice I need is never at a place like this so we always bring our own habanero sauce, haha. 

The restaurant was pretty chilly inside I'm guessing for when the restaurant gets packed I'm sure it gets warmer but around 11am my food was just getting cold faster. 

Overall I won't wait in line for an hour however I would come back again, especially to try the pastor.  When there is no line out the door and to just have a relax lunch."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this new taco joint, but very disappointed. Over priced and not very good food. I won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"We heat here at least once a week typically after 3 o'clock on Tuesdays they have a taco special for 179 for taco. So we tend to come out for taco Tuesday. The food is fair not amazing but pretty good"}
{"text":"My husband and I recently moved to Mesa and happen to live just down the street from Backyard Taco. After about two weeks, we had eventually made our way there after being bombarded with positive reviews about the place. 
The food was fantastic! I got one of each taco and they were absolutely delicious. The meat was overflowing and incredibly flavorful. My husband ordered a burrito and I was equally impressed. The atmosphere was so fun and lively and there is a lovely place to sit just outside. 
The girl at the register was a bit unfriendly, but everyone else we interacted with was fantastic. The parking was also a bit scary, but well worth the decadent food. 
 I can't wait to go back and try other items on their menu! Fantastic date night stop if you are looking for great authentic Mexican food!"}
{"text":"If Mexican food is on the list, then stop in here!! The food here is great. Small place so parking and seating is always always packed but there is a reason why. You can call ahead to help to beat the line."}
{"text":"Love this place! My new favorite taco place and the food is so good. I love their carne asada tacos. I eat here about three times a week. They make their tacos just like my mother's. The food is authentic and fresh. The place is always clean and the owners are there firing up the grill. It really has a family appeal."}
{"text":"I found this place with a friend one night and now we are obsessed. I love the simplicity of their menu and how fresh and delicious everything tastes. I normally get the tacos and their amazing horchata!"}
{"text":"My wife, kid and I went on a Friday night in February.  I can see why this place is so popular.  


We ordered the family pack which comes with 16 tortillas and 1 lb of meat.  The cashier gave me a free cup upgrade.

We were happy to see heaters on the ceiling outside so we ate there.  My wife thought they gave us more than a pound of meat.  It was flavorful and the sauces have a kick.

I recommend parking as far away as possible since it can be a cluster to get out."}
{"text":"The best tacos $1.50 can buy! Seriously, great price for a great meal. The barria taco was the best, very juicy and flavorful. Great salsa bar and misters on the patio. I will definitely bring my crew back next Taco Tuesday."}
{"text":"Some of the best tacos in Arizona! I've always been a regular for the tacos and salsa bar but recently I've been getting the papa loca. It is beyond delicious and I highly recommend it! Great service, great food and ambience. If you haven't tried it yet you need to go!"}
{"text":"My brother turned my onto Backyard Taco and I haven't looked back! So delicious! The burritos put Chipotle and any other place to shame."}
{"text":"Truly authentic Mexican.  I loved the quesadilla.  My only letdown is that I enjoy crunchy taco's, which they do not do.  Next time I am going to try the burrito."}
{"text":"Filibertos is better and cheaper. Backyard taco has a nice patio. That's it in a nutshell.  Oh- way too much onion on everything."}
{"text":"It's pretty good for Gilbert area Mexican food. Carne asada and birria meats are my favorite here."}
{"text":"The food is great. Most of the seating is outside. Parking is packed so try to carpool. Well worth it! They also have a decent salsa bar. This place is always busy when I have gone."}
{"text":"One of my friends raves and raves about Backyard Taco, endlessly. Like within a few weeks of him taking me there, he, like a little puppy, asked me uber excitedly if I'd been back since. Haven't had a chance dude!

I was surprised that at 9PM on a weeknight a) there was a line b) kids were awake in said line for dinner! You know it's legit if the line is long that late. My friend led the way and ordered a handful of tacos. I got a chicken, al pastor, and a carne asada. Al pastor was the best of the three. All over-flowing with fillings and a really good fresh tortilla. Their salsa bar isn't too bad either, especially the non-spicy salsas. I checked into Yelp to get the free chips & salsa, and I'm glad they were free. Quite the disappointment, the chips were stale and the salsa was just bad. Save the check-in and spend money on something else like a quesadilla or an extra side of guac or even an extra taco!"}
{"text":"One amazing Taco restaurant.  Simple, delicious food with lots of added condiments for your tacos.  Only downside is it does get busy so be prepared for a little wait."}
{"text":"Unreal!!! These tacos are hands some of the best I have ever had. Their fresh salsa bar adds some great flavors as well. I would highly recommend anyone looking for great tacos to make sure they are on your list of restaurants to stop at."}
{"text":"Let us be honest with our selves. This place is tasty. 
Eat and eat and eat. The only problem is the total of your purchase will surprise you and get pretty high pretty quick."}
{"text":"Awesome and reasonable prices!  Fairly quick service - was pretty busy on a Wednesday night.   Meat was seasoned perfectly and was so tender. Will be back soon"}
{"text":"Really really good food. The best Pollo and carne asada that I've had in a while. The food is seasoned well and has that good Smoky flavor to it. If you want to try their tacos go on Tuesday otherwise it's $2 and some change for one. The green salsa is pretty good. And the chicken quesadilla is packed with chicken, no skimpy meals over here"}
{"text":"I finally decided to give this place a try. Everyone has been talking about it since it opened a few months ago. The food was what you would expect from a taco guy. It took FOREVER to order (long line with only 1 cashier) and even longer to get our food. Then when we got our food the Salsa bar was \"Closed for Cleaning\". The guy cleaning the salsa bar had no sense of urgency and took about 15 minutes to clean it. I was starving by the time we finally got our food so I couldn't wait for him to finish. I'd go back but definitely not the top of my list."}
{"text":"Slowest service in the world. I do not recommend coming here on a lunch break or if your in a rush. Rude staff and minimal seating. But over all amazing food. The best authentic street tacos my family and I have had since home in Sinaloa. Good and free selection of sides and garnish including fresh homemade tomatillo salsa. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome! Nothing but good things to say! Popular, seating inside, and cute places to sit outside! Nice customer service, man I spoke with was very helpful. Easy to read menu, good price. Tacos were delicious!"}
{"text":"Pretty good tacos and they got taco Tuesday which makes it a killer deal. Gets packed but they are quick with the orders and your enjoying your food pretty quick. Had al pastor which they make more traditional but still pretty good. Not so much a place for family sit down, but more like a quick lunch or late night munchies suppression."}
{"text":"Love this place. Every time I go to visit my parents in Mesa I always head here for some food. The potatoes, tacos and all are just great!! I'm in love with the el pastor tacos but everything is delicious, even down to the tortillas they use."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!!!!!!! The Al Pastor, the horchata, the cleanliness, the portions... they're all amazing!"}
{"text":"I have been all over the valley to have tacos and this by far is the best spot!! There has not been one item that I've ordered that I haven't devoured. From the salsas to the chorreadas to the crazy potatoes.....absolutely delicious!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place, but I have heard that people either love it or hate it, so your mileage may vary.

First off, everything is a la carte. There are no \"combo platters\" or anything like that. You order what you want. (don't forget the Yelp check-in special for free chips and salsa!)

Don't expect \"sit-down\" Mexican restaurant with waitstaff, plates, and silverware. If you think of it more like a stationary food truck, you may have a better idea of what this place is all about. I have tried everything on the menu and have not been disappointed. Unlike some other reviewers, I have not experienced the \"dry meat\" syndrome, although sometimes we have seen pretty light cheese on the quesadillas. The \"Papa Loca\" is something I have not seen on the menu anywhere else, and it is both tasty and filling, but I really prefer the tacos and gorditas. My wife and kids really like the quesadillas. Don't forget to grab some sauces, pico, and salsa from the salsa bar to dress up your tacos -- they are traditional and very simply prepared. Therein lies the beauty. 

The place is small and can get VERY crowded, but service generally remains pretty fast. I have not been there on \"taco Tuesday\" when they drop the price on their tacos, but I can imagine the place becomes a veritable zoo.  

I found the beans to be a little bland, but anyone who has made real refried beans at home knows that many recipes don't call for a lot of seasoning in the beans -- that way, you can add that after the fact with toppings and salsas.

The horchata is worth getting: it always tastes fresh."}
{"text":"I was really really excited to try Backyard Taco. I love close to the location and was excited when I saw it being built. Opening day, I stayed away because of the crowd. Tuesday, the line was out the door, I was even more excited to try the tacos. Today (3.23.2017) Thursday, 4 days after the opening my wife and I decided to try it. We walked right in, waited 5 minutes to order our food. I thought great, no long wait. I ordered our food at 8:08 p.m. we found a seat and waited. We were never given our horchata that we ordered, I had to flag down someone to get those. We listened as the numbers passed. No line, no one waiting for tables (there were plenty open inside and outside)...we finally got our food at 9:10 p.m. 6 carne asada tacos took an hour? I know it's opening week, I feel like it might have been premature, or not planned well. I even tried to call ahead and kept getting a voicemail to leave a message, hence why we went to the location to eat there. We had waited so long we decided to go home with our food. It was decent but I'm 99.9% sure my family and I will not be back."}
{"text":"You know how when you burp after eating tacos you sometimes get a smile on your face?  I'm smiling and the folks around me at my son's concert aren't smiling so much. 

Totally worth going out of the way for. I went on taco Tuesday so it was busy. The cashier was super professional.  Prices were mega reasonable at $1.79/taco. I got a chicken, an al pastor and a carne asada. Three were enough to fill me up but if I would have had six in front of me I would have eaten them all.

They were mega tasty. There was a line out the door but it moved really fast. I'm so happy to have found this place. They are much cleaner, cost less and the service is way better than another place around there by a skateboard place. I have a new favorite for this area and plan to go back soon.

Tacos are really fabulous!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome!  We are frequent visitors of Mexico and love everything about the country - and this was the next best thing.  We ordered the chips. carne asada burrito, carne asada taco, pollo asada taco, and a vegi loco papas.  They were all SO good!!!  The lemonade was killer and hubby enjoyed drinking a Mexi Coke out of the bottle.  Killer lunch for two?  Well under $20."}
{"text":"7pm on a friday,packed must be good, looks are deceiving,ordered 3 Tacos, when i got them home i opened the container,and walla,i observed 3 sorry small Tacos, with a little more than a teaspoon full of crumbled i would assume steak ,i bit of white substance, it was either cheese or cabbage,there was not enough of it to distinguish the difference.had a homerun inn frozen pizza for dinner, next time ill make my own tacos."}
{"text":"It was OK. Passed it many times and always saw a line of cars so finally made it in. The chicken was overly smokey flavored for my taste. The shredded beef was OK. Not sure I'd be back anytime soon


Update.. Received message from owner about review and welcoming me back to order maybe something a little different from first visit. Based on his reaching out, I think I might have to give them another shot. I'll let you know how other options compare. Thank you BYT for reaching out."}
{"text":"If you are a vegetarian then you can skip this place in a heartbeat and you will totally have no regrets even though you might see some long queues outside this place. I visited this place drawn by those long queues and expected it would be awesome but sadly not. You have no veggie option other than a bean and cheese burrito. How cruel !!! Although you could add some veggies as add ons on the burrito but still it was an ordinary bean cheese which I can very well make at my home. They have three sauces - guacamole purre, a medium heat sauce and an extremely hot one. The hot one is pure heat with no flavor so not sure who wants to put their mouth? on fire just for the sake of it. Makes no sense for that sauce to be there as it doesn't bring anything to the table.

Prices are pretty reasonable though not too expensive."}
{"text":"Place is awesome I didn't like it at first because my order was messed up but went again and man worth every penny just wish they would put cheese on my tacos to make them better but overall pretty good place to eat"}
{"text":"When the king of pop decided against \"Beautiful Young Thing\" for his epic 1982 album, Thriller, that set the wheels in motion for what we know today as BYT.

When this place is packed, and it gets packed, you'll be doing the moonwalk as patrons enter and exit by means of any open crevice between you and the other line-mongers.  Michael was so right... You Are Not Alone, but tough it out, because once you sink those bleached choppaz into your first bite, you'll Wanna Be Startin Somethin.

I can personally vouch for the carne asada, chicked and birria tacos, with the later being my favorite.  My wife and I split a carne, cheese and bean burrito.  My only complaint was the fatty chunks, and the gristle.  I wont ding them too hard, as they were totally slammed.

The biggest disappointment of the night came in a styrofoam cup.  The side of frijoles we ordered had to have been from a can... like a can of Rosarita.  I can see them needing a fallback with as  busy as they were, its possible they could have sold out of the good stuff.  I wont know for sure, until my return visit.  I use Elmer's Tacos or Rancho Market as my bean baseline, so be on your A game guys, because based on The Way You Make Me Feel will determine if I'm going to continue to Rock With You, or not... because I will Remember The Time.

I also polished off an order of chips & salsa, a Mexican coke and a large horchata... so I left pre-diabetic and pretty stuffed... so much that I almost didn't recognize that Man In The Mirror."}
{"text":"The Jamaica agua fresca is FABULOUS!  Sooo refreshing on a hot Phoenix day.  I usually get the Crazy Potatoes, which I love for their mesquite smoke flavor.  Great patio and I'm sure the rest of their food is tasty just based on smell alone!  Always busy (a great sign) but they move you through very fast.  A gem right in my own backyard."}
{"text":"We really like this place. They have a small menu, so that is really nice. We always get a family pack of tacos that is half steak and half chicken with flour tortillas.( It comes with one pound of cooked meat, sixteen tortillas and the toppings so you assemble them at home or wherever.) If you ask they will give you bigger containers to fill up at their salsa bar, instead of the small ones that they have out. ( Useful if you are getting a family pack.) 
I am giving them four stars instead of five because it is hit or miss if they will actually be open.  Several times over the past year we have gotten there just to find out they are closed for something or another ( Water heater breaking, owners being on vacation, or just closing early and not giving an excuse.) We have learned to call in advance, it has saved a lot of trips out there when they are closed during their normal business hours. They also aren't open on Sundays, so that sucks."}
{"text":"Yay! Love Backyard Taco so much! I worked in Mesa for a couple of years and would always go to their original location. I love their story and more importantly, I love their food!! Now, they have a location in Gilbert. It's closer to my family so I'm able to frequent it more often - best day to go is (of course) Taco Tuesday!!! If I'm not there on a Tuesday, my absolute next favorite thing to order is the Crazy Potatoe with Carne Assada! Get it - you won't regret it! Service was quick and one of the employees even checked on us to see how the food was tasting!! Needless to say, I'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"The Carne Asada was pretty good. A couple of good sauces too.

The Birra is a pulled beef. That was also good.

The Pastor was really really dry and not very good at all. Which is a bummer because we went for the Pastor. Not too many people do it these guys shouldn't either.

The other downside is the quesadillas and burritos are kinda small. Nothing like El Guero Canelo which this place is supposed to compete with. Also no fresh serranos which would be nice."}
{"text":"This is such a chill & laid back taco shop for the casual Mexican food diner.  This spot has everything I like in a restaurant:  simple menu, great value, and speedy service.  The ambiance is much align with the name, you get the feel like you are at someone's home which is always conducive to a good time.  I've been here for lunch and dinner and I always leave satisfied.  I recently stopped eating meat and find that the cheese quesadilla with the cabbage mix, or the vegetarian loco potato suffice as great meals."}
{"text":"IM A FAN

When there is still a line for tacos on a Thursday night at 9pm, I think that's a good sign. Its literally the size of a small house and the parking lot is the size of their side and backyard. I'm sure if I came during prime time, there would be no parking. 

We ordered an array of different tacos all which were A M A Z I N G. They had good sized salsa bar with an array of different types of salsa and cucumbers, red onions, and other sides. Horchata was bomb. 

There is limited indoor and outdoor seating. So if there is a long line, you'll probably have to take it to go. Service is fast and friendly. I can't wait till I go back!

Environment: 4/5
Food: 5/5
Price: 4/5
Service: 5/5"}
{"text":"The pork tacos are the best thing I've ever eaten. I add the avocado salsa as well. I could eat 100 if these.
This is my fav place in AZ!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for taco Tuesday my my sweetheart. We got one of everything. The tortillas were a little flakey, but I can't say any taco was bad. The price was $1.79 vs the regular price of $2.25. There was a deceiving amount of outdoor seating meaning that there was much more than what appears from the street. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"This place is good. I've ordered from here twice already and unfortunately they did mess up my order both times 

They messed up one taco (plain taco for my daughter) on one order and 4 tacos (no onions) on another order.

This is not going to stop me from going back but I will have to check my order before I leave which isn't a good thing.

The brownish salsa & guacamole lacks flavor and it's NOT that spicy from what the other reviewer stated. 

The guacamole needs more guacamole and \"less cabbage/water?\" when they blend it. Why not add some boiled tomatillo, lemon and cilantro to it to give it more flavor?

A red salsa (chiles japones with boiled red tomatoes/tomatillo + seasoning) would go great with the carne asada tacos. The one they currently have is that brownish jalapeno salsa.

They have another tomato-y red salsa but it ruins the tortilla because it's too runny.

This place has potential, but they need to step it up. Train the staff and improve the order and delivery process."}
{"text":"So good! The beans are some of the best I've tasted! Loved the gordita. Good atmosphere, good prices, great food!"}
{"text":"Backyard Taco  has good food. You can see them making the food over a BBQ behind the register. They also have a self serving salsa bar for some fixins. We had the burrito, chicken and carne tacos. Quick, affordable, tasty Mexican food."}
{"text":"Great food. I've been eating this stuff since it was actually made in his backyard. But the prices are a little high."}
{"text":"The line was pretty long on our first visit, but they keep it moving along. The location is small, but I love the feel of the patio. The food is fantastic and priced very fairly. We love their carne asada everything and we always hit the salsa bar that is full of fresh options. 

We have been back a few times now and have nothing but good things to say."}
{"text":"We used to eat this food before they turned it into a restaurant when it really was \"backyard\" tacos. 

The carne asada quesadilla is legit. Best meat and salsas to add to it. 

The gordita, never had one before, was a little different. It was kind of hard but yet soft. The meat was delicious. 

The salsas were awesome. 

Great looking and clean interior too."}
{"text":"Tried it out on a recommendation.  Decent Mexican food for the price.  Wasn't clear as to what the ordering procedure was though.  Only a couple of tables inside.  Outside on the patio was a little to noisy for my taste being in next to the constant street traffic.  If I go next time, I will order carry-out."}
{"text":"Food is good, disappointed they didn't have a real guacamole though. The patio is super cute but hard to hear anything because it's by a busy road. My biggest complaint is that the girls working there are just stone cold and don't even say hello! If I asked a question I just got a stare down and no response. Very strange."}
{"text":"We love the food here. My favorite is The shredded beef tacos.  The staff is always friendly!!"}
{"text":"First time here.  Easy to order and sit where you like.  Good looking menu.  I had the carne asada and chicken tacos.  Love the fixings and salsa bar."}
{"text":"I like Backyard Tacos! The food is yummy and a good price. I really love sitting outside under the cute lights. 

My one issue with this place is the set up of the salsa bar! There is constantly a group of people around it because it's just not set up for more than 1 person at a time. 

Other than that I think it's a fun and casual place to eat!"}
{"text":"Not a fan.  The food portions are large, but the flavors seemed to be too smoky and burnt almost. I went with a friend for lunch the other day to give it a try.  Staff seemed rushed and there was no sense of customer service.  I most likely won't be back but was worth a try!"}
{"text":"Always a good choice for some delicious food! Been coming here for the past year and a half, never once have I been disappointed. It does get pretty busy around lunch so plan ahead when going for a work day run."}
{"text":"WOW so good! I don't think you could go wrong ordering anything here. SO DELISH! Husband ordered carne asada gordita I got a carne asada taco and a chicken tostada."}
{"text":"Today was our first time going to backyard taco. We ordered the potato thing, a bean and cheese burrito, one chicken taco and 1 steak taco. They have a nice salsa bar with an arrangement of cells does. The place seems pretty authentic, down to the flies going after your food. Regardless it was good. We ordered the potato thing because everybody talked about it in the reviews, it was pretty good, a little difficult to eat because all the food sticks to the tin foil. The bean and cheese burrito was very good, they don't skimp on the cheese at all which is always a plus for me. We didn't realize until after leaving that if you check in on Yelp you get a free chips and salsa. Will be going back to get it another time because the food was pretty good."}
{"text":"Darn good tacos and really cool place. Always busy and the steak and chicken are equally as good, really impossible to decide which I like better! Will be returning weekly!"}
{"text":"Wow! What happened!? Husband and I used to LOVE this place. We ordered our taco assortment with chips and salsa with a side of beans. First sadness was they changed the chips! No more thin hot crispy corn chips. Now they have stale white corn store bought chips. Beans were cold. Next was the cucumbers at the salad bar were old and yellowish. Not fresh and green like before. Last. Carne asada. It was chewy and had lots of grizzle. 
It's sad because they used to be great! I always stood up for them when people would say how bad it was. The quality just isn't there anymore. 
We wonder if Mesa changed at all. The only saving grace was the el pastor was delish and service was good. But quality of everything else just went down."}
{"text":"Omg. Love this place! I don't know why we never learned about this place before! They are a cute well decorated little place. It was amazing seeing all the carne asada on the grill behind the counter and it was delicious!! 
We ordered 3 chicken tacos, and 3 steak tacos, chips and salsa, and a steak quesadilla. The only complaint was the quesadilla needed more cheesy goodness. 
But we paid $16 for all of it! And that included a large drink! They have a fresh salsa bar which was full of different salsas, onions, and cucumbers. 
So good! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Good tacos, and generous size. The open grill inside is pretty neat and the meat has a good taste to it. Not your average Mexican joint so the experience of eating here gets lost but overall its a winner."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos in a relaxed atmosphere. Salsa bar has great options of heat and flavor."}
{"text":"After driving by all the time when I go to the gym, my boyfriend and I finally went. Wonderful service, clean and great atmosphere (could barely hear street traffic on University), and most importantly, delicious! I love the smaller portioned tacos, and the salsa bar was always stocked and fresh. Will definitely be making bicycle trips back and become a regular! :)"}
{"text":"To preference my review I will say that I went on Taco Tuesday at 7pm, so that could explain some of the issues. 

The Atmosphere
The restaurant was very dirty. There was salsa from the salsa bar all over the floor, and the bar itself. The tables were extremely dirty as well as the drink machine. Because of it being so busy, all the employees were behind the counter preparing the food and taking orders, not cleaning tables. It was also extremely loud and the noise echoed. It was hard to hear the people in our party speak, so we couldn't really have conversations. Again, most of these issues were probably caused by the large amounts of people. 

The food
We ordered chips and salsa, three different kinds of tacos, and a quesadilla.
The chips were those stale white corn chips you get from the supermarket, warmed up. The salsa had a lot of lime juice in it so it was hard to eat. The medium hot salsa from the salsa bar was great! Good flavor and sneaky amount of heat. The pico was also great! Would have been much better with homemade chips or better quality chips. I was also disappointed you could not order guacamole. Only guacamole sauce was offered on the salsa bar. 
The carne asada tacos had a good flavor, were just bland. I love cheese on my tacos and this did not come with. The chicken for the chicken tacos had good flavor but the chicken was very burned. The Al pastor meat had amazing flavor. 
The quesadilla was great, but needed more cheese.

IF we ever come again we will definitely get our food to go."}
{"text":"This place was ok. Salsa (hot & mild) is just not good. They also messed up my order in the drive thru. No plans on going back."}
{"text":"The food is OK; the ambience sucks; there's too much plastic and styrofoam."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this more than I did.  The place was cute.  I liked the vibe of it.  I had a beef taco and bean and cheese burrito.  They were fine.  Nothing outstanding.  Maybe I ordered the most boring thing on the menu.  I would give it another chance.  Customer service was good.  I just found the food to be ok compared to all the hype.  I have a theory that places in Gilbert are rated artificially higher because people are just excited for something new."}
{"text":"My favorite tacos is town! Of course I haven't had a whole lot of tacos at different places. But I believe it's better than Tia Rosas, better than Rubios, Morenos, and the place at old town Gilbert.
The meat is divine!!! I like beef on flour tortilla."}
{"text":"I'm from LA so I know good street tacos when I taste them and this place is as close to LA style street tacos as it gets in AZ. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Came here because I love authentic Mexican food. The Carne Asada was perfect!! The Birria was new to me however really good.  I like the way the dice up the onions and cilantro.  Only reason I did not go 5 Stars is that the salsa was all good but none that was very hot.  If you are reading this you must try this gem of a place."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been to this location. The foods just as good as their Mesa location. But the service is terrible. It seems they have a bunch of young people at the counter that just can't get it. It's gotten consistently better since opening, maybe it's time for another try here. I'm lucky enough to live in between the two."}
{"text":"I like this Backyard Taco. It's almost always busy but the service is always great. Not much of a wait time after I place my order and it's always been right on. The food is unbelievably consistent, always good! 
The best taco joint around."}
{"text":"I have now been three times to Backyard Taco, so I must amend my first review. Today I got the Crazy Potato and loved it!  The cabbage was fresh and added a wonderful note of sweetness to the entre...I think I have been converted!"}
{"text":"Stopped by after a Cubs Spring Training game and it hit the spot! All of the meats are cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"Exploring food around my new job. This place is good. Just like grilling carne asada and chicken tacos at home but better because I don't have to do the work! It's a little spot, plan on eating outside when busy."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best Tacos I've ever had! I'm glad we got there before five, because when the work crowd showed up the line when out the door! They were obviously regulars because no one cared that they had to wait. Next time were in the Mesa area we will be in for more of this great food!"}
{"text":"The carne asada is awesome! On Tuesday it is $1.25 taco night... Place is always fairly busy for a good reason - the food is good!"}
{"text":"Best street tacos in Mesa hands down.  If you have been searching for some authentic tacos al carbon this is the place.  They only offer (3) meat options.  Asada (steak), Pollo (grilled chicken), and Birrea (beef).  All the meat is cooked on mesquite grills right in front of you, as well as fresh corn and flour tortillas.  Tacos cost $1.85 each which is still pretty reasonable as I've paid $3.5-$5 each at hipster taco shops in Phoenix (I.E. joyride tacos). I'm not a fan of the burritos or tostado, I would recommend the tacos or quesadilla which is like a bigger taco but with melted cheese.. I would recommend Asada Tacos for folks that are on the fence about what to order, you can't go wrong.  They have a really solid salsa bar that includes a really good Avocado based Salsa, like a thin guacamole.  Only thing I think this place is lacking is variety.  I'd love to be able to order some Tacos Al Pastor, or maybe an option for Asada Fries. But they do make excellent food.. Expect to wait 10-20 minutes in line if you come during a peak times (lunch or dinner)."}
{"text":"We have been waiting for this place to open for months. The service has been a little slow, but everyone is trying to get used to the new system. The food has been great, not a complicated menu, very simple. The parking isn't the greatest, but we live close so we usually walk. The owners are extremely nice and friendly and they have a great following.
We are actually going there again tonight."}
{"text":"Blah, no flavor at all.  Hot sauce was either hot and no flavor or no heat and no flavor.  Guac tasted very \"watered down\"  I think they just increased the sour cream to make the dip last longer.  Staff wasn't very friendly.  The place doesn't look clean, but  2 stars because we didn't get sick."}
{"text":"Looks can be deceiving. This tiny little joint is unassuming and looks like nearly every other dive Mexican restaurant out there - of which there are thousands in the Phoenix area.

Just wait until you roll your windows down a half a mile away and you smell the meat searing on a wood-fired grill!

Simple, nothing flashy, nothing fancy - but pure taco goodness. Despite being at a charcoal grill place, I ordered the birria (slow cooked in juices and spices). Some of the best birria I've ever had! 

They don't junk their food up with extras - it's to the point, simple and straightforward and - DAMNED GOOD. 

It's nowhere near being convenient for us to go there - but the food will draw us back - as we are want to do. 

Prices are very affordable - taco shop prices. 

They have a nice selection of very tasty salsas and some other typical taco shop accoutrement. 

Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"It's the BOMB dot com!! It's authentic, it's fast, decent prices, and delicious food. Recently moved from Chicago, and finding a good taco place has been hard! But this place is soo good. My husband ordered asada tacos, a birria, and al pastor. All mouth watering delicious! I ordered a gordita, although it was good, it was like a sope. The food was on top instead of inside. We ordered some horchata and a flan as well, not disappointing. The horchata you can tell wasn't that powder ish . If I had to complain about something it'd be that I wish it was bigger, more seating. You should definitely try it out. You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Very very good tacos and horchata. Asada is best.  Worth the short drive from the 60 on your way through town. 

Avoid the other parts of the menu as those were less well executed. Salsa was bland, chips tasted store bought, tostada was meh."}
{"text":"This place is so CRAZY DELICIOUS!! If those words do not get you running to this place, well then read the rest of this review.
Last Friday, this mama bear was craving good carne asada tacos (you know the ones that you get from a food cart in Rocky Point with the runny guac). I did not expect what I was expecting.
By 5pm this place has a line out the door. Once you start walking to the entrance you can smell the delicious mesquite grilled meat being cooked to perfection. As the line slowly moved, the more watery my mouth got. I felt like I hit the jackpot once the girl at register asked me what I would like to order.
-2 carne asada tacos with all the fixings
-1 carne asada quesadilla.

After that line was done, you also had to make a dash to the salsa bar. Their salsas are the bomb! Habanero, Red, Green, Pico de Gallo, Radishes, Onions, Limes, Creamy Guac, YOU NAME IT!!

I patiently sat for my number to be called and once it did ...OMG HEAVEN. Each bite was inexplicably delicious.  I ate every bite. Even the small morsels that fell on my plate. I sat there digesting in disbelief on how I never knew a place so close to home existed. 

Let's just say I have been telling everyone about this small mom-n-pop shop. They do it RIGHT! No fluff, just RIGHT.

Thank you Backyard Taco. I am your biggest fan."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place. We ordered some pick up. On arrival the clerk said they had zero orders, and we \"MUST HAVE\" called the wrong location. Of course they found it, and hadn't even started working on it. On arrival at home, there were a few items missing and overall just a slack-job on the meal. When I called and asked to speak to the manger, they forgot to put me on mute, laughing \"damn, he wants a manger. Pretend to be a manger!\" Then Angel gets on the phone and says without a hello, \"What's the problem?\". Thank god for UberEATS. This place is a stone's throw from my house but I won't be back. Tragic."}
{"text":"This is  Backyard Taco's new second location and wow! It's just as good as the original. We had a crazy potato that is filled with cheese, sour cream and your choice of meat or not lol!! With also minced cabbage and onions in it.It's so......good. My hubby likes to put on his half, the jalapeño sauce. ( just a little) oh and of course we had street tacos mine on corn tortillas and his on flour. Al pastor ( pork with pineapple ) and topped with a little red onion and cilantro  and carne asada (steak) topped with the minced onion and cabbage and cilantro omg!! All really good. This new location is big and really busy. Busy is Backyard taco's middle name. Well worth going !! Check it out you'll love it."}
{"text":"If you want great authentic street tacos this is the place to come. The meats are grilled and oh wow !! So, so good. They have a lot of other items like a crazy potato that is really good. It's a baked potato filled with sour cream , your choice of grilled meat finely diced cabbage onions pico and a special sauce. If you go,try it during the week..  if you dare the weekends are ipacked out the door waiting but, well worth it. :)"}
{"text":"My favorite tacos in AZ! I used to go to the original location every week but recently moved and started going here and....am I crazy or does this location taste even better?! Definitely a must try."}
{"text":"Omg i love love this location! There is a different location close to me but I really wanted to try this one and let me tell you, this place is amazing. Its huge with plenty of seating and they have an outdoors area too! The food is 
Delicious!! We had the family pack and it was enough for 5 and a toddler. The place was super clean (bathrooms included). It also has a drive thru. I would definitely come back! Best tacos in arizona!"}
{"text":"I been here two times all for lunch and it was very busy. There are limited tables so we had to wait around ten min for an empty table. The tacos were a little expensive for my liking but they were pretty full. I had 3 asada tacos. They were delicious. They are opening a new place that looks better! This location is small and needs an update. Bottom line tacos are good, expect a wait for foos and a table."}
{"text":"Backyard taco is my all time fav taco place. I live in chandler and drive way out of my way just for backyard taco. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Loved the place. Froze my ass off dining outside as the indoor seating is limited. Although the Carne Asada street tacos were great, too much onion was a little over bearing so I will leave them off next time. We will be going back in the future."}
{"text":"Super fast, friendly service, delicious food and fun, casual atmosphere. My husband got a carne asada taco and a chicken to decide which he wanted in his burrito. I got the vegetation crazy potato. I enjoyed raiding the salsa bar. He chose carne asada  and enjoyed his giant burrito too."}
{"text":"Meat not so good and the price per taco is too much. I will stick to home made. It's a typical Mexican food in Az."}
{"text":"Delicious food at a good price. I like the tacos, and they have the best chicken burrito I've ever had (with yummy bacon) (wish it was a little less salty).

Removed one star because the inside is Too Small & cramped, only 4 tables and they're usually ALL taken. Eating outside in patio during the Summer is not an option.
To the Owners: Please enclose the patio & add ice cold AC ASAP. 

If this restaurant was closer & next to the freeway, I might eat here all the time.

12/23/2016 update: They seemed to have eliminated (or tremendously reduced) the bacon strips from their chicken burrito -- not okay with me. They also raised prices. Somewhat smoky inside today -- is something wrong with their ventilation??  
A bad combination. Reduced rating from 4 to 3 stars.
It may be a while before I go back."}
{"text":"Got thereon a Saturday night around 6pm with a group of 6 adults and 2 children. Inside had one open table and the patio was about 1/3 full. About 8 people in front of us in line. Ordered the family packet (1 pound of meat - carne asada and al pastor - plus 16 tortillas), 2 cheese quesadillas and 2 stuffed quesadillas (chicken and birria) - came out to around 45 bucks. Food was out and hot in about 7 minutes. Even heard them call out orders that were placed after us while waiting for our food. Very impressed with the speed by which they were able to whip up our large order.

Carne asada street taco was my favorite with the stuffed chicken quesadilla coming in second. With that said, everything was tasty. If I had to be picky, maybe the al pastor was a bit dry? However, I've had al pastor very few times, so I'm no expert. Loved loading up the taco with stuff from the salsa bar, including the pickled onions. Next time, I'll forgo the raw onions that come with the street tacos and just stick with the cabbage, salsa, jalapeno and pickled onions. My daughter and son loved the cheese quesadillas.

I look forward to street tacos on my annual trip to Mexico and I'm confident that BYT can satisfy my cravings between trips. 

Line was out the door by 6:20pm."}
{"text":"Love this place! The fresh salsa and cucumbers makes the meal so delicious! It's always a hit at our house."}
{"text":"Very good place, they opened not too long ago and been growing ever since. Its a bit crowded. I think thry need a new location"}
{"text":"I love the Mesa Backyard Taco and was excited to see their new location open up in Gilbert. I have only had the chance to visit in the evenings for dinner and it always hits the spot. The al pastor meat is so flavorful and tender, it is becoming my new favorite. The chicken is seasoned perfectly and is not dry. The corn and flour tortillas are also delicious, I am partial to the corn but the flour ones taste homemade and brings out the flavors of the meat. I love that there is aquas frescas like limeade, horchata and jamaica, which all taste delicious. There is also a wide variety of the bottled sodas, you can never go wrong with a bottles Coke or orange Fanta.  The staff is courteous, quick and attentive. Sometimes it may take a little longer than fast food to geth your order, but the freshness and taste definitely make up for it. The restaurant itself is amazing, the best part is sitting outside in their cooled patio and enjoying great food and a cold drink."}
{"text":"Perfect! Delish and yummy food! My favorite is the carne asada stuffed burrito (liked a baked potato with carne asada on top)."}
{"text":"You know they're doing something right when you walk in and they're roasting jalapeños over a huge wood burning grill!  Only wish is they had better seating!"}
{"text":"Simple menu decent price.  I wasn't a fan of the salsa but it grew on me.  The meat is all fire grilled and cooked perfectly.  The place is packed whenever I go and it can be overwhelming, but it is worth it, the wait is not that long even when its packed.  ******Bring cash for the tip, if you tip on your credit card the owners keep it.*****"}
{"text":"I went here with a friend last night after wanting to try this place for some time. It was nice that they are open late (ish... 11pm). I was really excited to try their food after reading all of the rave reviews, but overall, I thought it was just ok. I ordered a birria taco, a carne asada gordito - crispy as recommended by the girl taking my order, and a pollo vampiro. All of this (plus my free chips... thanks Yelp!) cost about 9$, fairly reasonable. The restaurant was busy, with many people waiting to get a table inside due to it being fairly cold outside (though they had heaters going outside making it effectively warmer out there), but we managed to snag a table inside. The food was prepared quickly and with a stop at the salsa bar, we were ready to eat. Unfortunately, the food was sort of a mixed bag. My friend had a bean and cheese burro and said it was amazing. The birria taco was fairly good, the meat was tender and flavorful. The vampiro was decent.... I liked the crispy tortilla, but the meat was nothing special. The gordita was not so good. The shell was incredibly chewy and hard to eat, the flavor was on the burnt side.... the carne asada was fine, but the shell... not so much. I'm not sure if this is how this dish usually tastes or if it was just an off night. The salsas from the salsa bar were all good and tasted fresh. They had many salsas that tasted unlike anything I have ever had before... in a good way. Overall, this place was alright, but I couldn't see myself making a special trip out here to have it again."}
{"text":"Yep. This place is legit. I removed one star simply because we called our order in, went down, waited 10 min and then had to re-place the order because they hadn't actually taken it. 
The food is great, however so I'm happy. :)"}
{"text":"Not a fan. The food is Meh, at best. But cute atmosphere, friendly staff, and quick orders. I would not go back for the food."}
{"text":"Burrito was just ok, pricey for what it was.  $27 for 2 burritos, bottle of coke and fountain drink. No sides!  There are several other burrito places in the area that are great and won't cost you a fortune."}
{"text":"This is the lowest stars I have ever given a restaurant. Was hopeful it was going to be a good experience. After waiting in line we finally placed our order.  It took over 40 min to get 3 tacos( turned out to be mini tacos)  and 1 burrito. The expectation is when you stand and order at the counter the food would be ready in a reasonable amount of time. They were kind enough to give us the chips and salsa we ordered when we asked for them after realizing we would not be seeing our meal anytime soon. The salsa with the chips wasn't bad but all the salsas on the bar were terrible especially a guacamole sauce. The guacamole sauce was a green tasteless liquid. The chicken in the tacos was flavorful but husband did not care for the steak. We had to ask to have our table wiped iff and then it was only3/4 done. This was a very disappointing experience.  Sadly (because I really liked the atmosphere) this was our first and last visit."}
{"text":"I don't get anything other than their pastor tacos. Hands down the best item they have. I've heard bad things about their other items but so far the pastor tacos have not let me down. They have a nice salsa bar and I like their avocado sauce. I do feel a little guilty buying tacos from a 'corporate' type of place rather than a mom and pops store that is more authentic all around the valley."}
{"text":"Great food nice friendly service cute outside place to sit but the prices are way to high for the amount of food they give you.  You think this is cheap but when you order you get this bite size taco and I do mean one bite size that's it.....  to bad they don't offer 2 tacos for the price they advertise.  I think that would make people happy and keep them busy."}
{"text":"Nom, nom, nom - can't talk - eating.  I'll sum it up: fantastic little taco joint, FRESH food & salsas, clean establishment. Got the Agua de Jamaica & Papa Loco spiced up at the salsa bar; it was so delicious that I hurt myself! Seriously, I ate so much that I actually hurt myself. Somebody help me - I can't wait to go back and do it again!"}
{"text":"When it comes to carne asada and horchata, this is my go-to spot. Whenever I have family and friends from out of town, we have to go here for dinner. The food is authentic, fresh, and reasonably priced. Only down sides are limited parking and small seating area which seems to always be busy, especially on Tuesdays. I feel like the food makes up for this so I still give them five stars."}
{"text":"People rave about this place but it was just ok to me. We ordered the steak quesadilla which had hardly any cheese, 3 burritos and 2 tacos to try. Our order came back missing 2 burritos. Everything was good but nothing special."}
{"text":"Worst experience here. I came in expecting great food and found a hair in my tacos and just bad quality all around. I was disappointed since I had gone to their other location and It was so good."}
{"text":"All of the awesomeness of Rocky Point tacos, but NONE of the diarrhea."}
{"text":"This place is the place ti be!! Tacos are great, specially the carne asada and the fish tacos"}
{"text":"Best Carne Asada tacos in AZ! Amazing meat cooked right in front of you. I cannot get enough and everyone I have brought here has gotten hooked. They are definitely worth every penny! Family packs are a great deal too you can feed 4 guys with one family pack."}
{"text":"It's always incredibly busy here, because it's fantastic! It's always super busy, loud, and packed, but I've never had a problem finding a seat!

I get quesadillas con birria, and they're amazing. They're incredibly greasy but they're delicious. The horchata is alright, but I like the horchata from Papa Chevo's/Los Faves better."}
{"text":"I went to Backyard Taco today with my wife and nephew.  Mind you, my nephew does not care much for Mexican style food.  All of us found the food to be quite good for the price.  It is a very casual place, but the food is of good quality.  

I had a gordita with chicken and a taco with carne asada.  My wife got a tostada and a taco, both with Chicken.  My nephew got two tacos with carne asada.  He actually liked it.  

Afterwards, we decided to enjoy some flan, which was also good.  The place is quite busy.  We would definitely go back if we are looking for an affordable place to eat Mexican.  

Usually with places like this the food is greasy, however, not here.  It was not greasy, and it was not salty."}
{"text":"Was driving by and noticed a sign that read \"Backyard Tacos\" then I noticed another sign that read \"Voted best tacos 2017\" if that wasn't enough to draw me in, The aroma that came into my car from the delicious that was being cooked an open flame inside, so what I had to do was make a U-turn and try it out for myself. I tried out the Carne asada and the Al Pastor tacos,there were other choices but these are the first two that I try when entering a new establishment that I've never been to. From the two I tried the Asada was the superior one to me. The salsa bar is great and the way they cook their meat on a open flame is awesome. I'm looking forward to trying out some of the other items on the menu as well. Thanks Guys see you soon

Part 2 
Yes! We came back just like I said we would. I got the burrito de Asada (beef) which was awesome the only bad is no rice but that's fine the taste of the meat makes up for it. My son also got a burrito de Asada and enjoyed it as well. We also ordered a Asada and chicken Gordita. These gorditas are not even close to what we expected. So I will stop there. Flan was good! I will buy it again if I had a craving of flan.You  really have excellent Carne Asada burritos &Tacos I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is delicious. The Papa Loco is amazing. Great idea. The tacos are excellent. The salsas and marinated vegetables are awesome. I love that they gave me a grilled jalapeno. I would love to see rice and beans added to the very small menu. The seating is wonderful, plenty of tables and chairs for a small place. Truly a class act. Thank you."}
{"text":"I think this is the most delicious Mexican food I've ever had, and I'm from AZ. Everything is homemade, and fresh! The flavors are heaven. I'm so happy right now."}
{"text":"Went here with my group for work to say goodbye to a teammate.  I had three Carne Asada tacos which were alright.  I was really hoping there would be a little more flavor or spice or something which most of us all agreed with.  Although we were all jealous of the one person who ordered the Potato...  damn we should have gotten that.  

We ended up sitting outside on their covered front patio which was really nice since it was a beautiful day out.   If I'm ever in the area... I'd keep this place in mind and I'd definitely try the potato next time.  However, I wouldn't go out of my way to get here since its pretty far from both my home and work."}
{"text":"I was very impressed by the authentic taste of their food. We ordered a chicken quesadilla, two carne tacos, one chicken taco, and a bean a cheese burro. The tacos were some of the best I've had. The green gauc sauce was very tasty, as were all of the other salsa options. One reviewer stated that he was disappointed because his tacos didn't have cilantro. All you have to do is ask. I requested cilantro on all three tacos. The prices are very reasonable and the quality of the food was great. The only issue right now is the length of the line since it is new. Just do the call ahead option to avoid the lines."}
{"text":"Oh boy this place is Great!!!  We have had all of their tacos and their Carne Asada burrito.  All have been awesome.  Do be warned this place is busy!  The line can be intimidating but they move through pretty quickly.  Absolutely a must if you love tacos and burritos."}
{"text":"The tacos are delicious!! So tasty but we tried the gordita, the burrito, quesadilla, and chips and salsa and were not impressed. The salsas are just okay as well. I will be returning but ONLY for the tacos!"}
{"text":"Backyard taco has become a regular lunch spot for me. It's close to work, food is really good, always tastes fresh and healthier than most taco spots and service has been consistently good. It's a pretty basic menu but what they do, they do well. I generally get one taco and a burrito which runs about $8. Tried the potato today (papa loco?). It was good, unique and a nice change but I do prefer the burritos. If you haven't been its worth checking out"}
{"text":"Been a fan of BT for a long time. This was our first time visiting the newer location in Gilbert.

THE GOOD - The building is big, bright and beautiful. So much more elbow room. Service was fast and everyone in our party of 5 enjoyed the taste of the tacos, particularly the chicken and al pastor.

THE BAD - Steak quesadilla was basically a ton of grease and bland meat inside a tortilla. It dripped a giant puddle of grease onto my plate and I didn't really taste anything like cheese. They also got one of my tacos wrong, but quickly and happily replaced it - no problem.

MUY MALO - It was a Saturday night, so expected it to be busy and hectic, but the table we found was a total wreck. Food/trash on the seats and on the floor underneath. I saw a cleaning person and asked, \"excuse me\" to get her attention. She turned around in full snarl mode and answered me with a loud, \"WHAT???\". I was shocked. Rude. I asked her if she could clean our table and after about 5 minutes, she came over and wiped the top off. She was already starting to walk away, when I pointed out there was still food and trash on the floor. She went for a broom, swept one side, then just walked off. Is it so hard to get a clean table? The owner lady (I believe), came over right after and finished cleaning the area herself, which was very nice of her.

So, all in all, we would have had an ok time if it wasn't for Miss Sassy-pants who couldn't be bothered to tidy up a bit. That, and my girlfriend ended up getting pretty sick from the food. Think we will stick to the original location from now on. Never have had a problem there."}
{"text":"This is seriously great food and served quickly.  We bought  the chicken family pack and a large refried beans.  They had lots of sides and limes, cucumber and radishes.  We are definitely planning to return here."}
{"text":"The food was great! Very authentic! Love seeing how they cook over charcoal for their meats! Will definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"Amazing and always satisfying! My family and I eat here at least once a week sometimes two. Everything on the menu is delicious. Highly recommend the Al Pastor!!"}
{"text":"Carne asada tacos were very good. Good prices too. Great salsa bar for everything u need. Great little place for some good tacos. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Back yard taco is THE BEST! Their prices went up quite a bit which I wasn't too happy about but the food is good"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place..
Being an L.A native, I guess I have a different understanding and love for tacos. 

This place just didn't impress me. 2 stars for being the only decent taco place in the area. 
I would go back, but won't go out of my way."}
{"text":"Best tacos ever Had. Don't know why it has such bad reviews. All the workers are very nice and the food is unbeatable. Please don't complain about the price... 2$ for a taco that delicious is incomparable. I definitely like this place better than americanized places like Joyride taco house that charges you 4-5$ for the same taco size LOL."}
{"text":"Ate here a few weeks back there was a bit of a line but it was well worth it. There salsa bar was fully stocked with plenty of options. I got my food togo, and got a variety of items as to try a couple things, and was not disappointed by any of them, everything was very good for the price. I will be back."}
{"text":"This place is very delicious!! Everything from their tacos to burritos you can't go wrong with any you order. The portions were good one to two people but you'll definitely want a plate to yourself. I would come back and enjoy a relaxing night with friends especially with their awesome vibe!!"}
{"text":"I don't often leave Yelp reviews, but the food at Backyard Taco left so much to be desired I felt like I had to. 

Pros: easy ordering over the phone, line moves quickly, short wait time in store 

Cons: the food...most of it. We ordered refried beans. The beans had clearly been burned, but for some reason the kitchen proceeded to make them into refried beans. The quesadilla we ordered was lukewarm, cheese barely melted, and tasted and felt like it had been microwaved. It probably hadn't been microwaved, but it spent little to no time on the grill. The gorditas were served on the worst, chewiest \"tostadas\". They hurt to chew. A tostada shouldn't be difficult to take a bite out of, but these were. The chips were ok, but the \"salsa\" that came with them lacked any flavor. It was literally tomatoes and pepper.  

The only redeeming items that we ordered were the birria taco and burrito. 

Don't waste your time here. Drive down to Tacos N' More at Higley and Queen Creek and eat some legit Mexican food there. Or better yet, make the longer drive to Los Taquitos."}
{"text":"AWESOME!! Everyrhing was so good, you cant go wrong! The wait was lengthy so go with some extra time, well worth the wait. Ive been back x3, will be back again!! I recommend the Carne Asada, but again, you cant go wrong!"}
{"text":"I am giving this one star because the Diet Coke was really, really good.  The food, not so much. The refried beans were beyond bland, the salsa was salty and the chicken tacos just bleh....we will not be back!"}
{"text":"Crazy rush here, lots of crowd but we did not seem to like the food much. Not made to our taste. Felt the chicken to be dry, beans had no taste. Quantity poor for the price. More like a take out. Place was not kept clean, spills everywhere. Did not work for us but a huge crowd pleaser it seemed.."}
{"text":"If you want mexican food, there's no spot like Backyard Taco. It's the best spot in town, and doesn't cost an arm, and a leg. Tacos, Tacos and Tacos. The best in town. Girl, you need to check out this place if you're in town!"}
{"text":"This location is ok.  It's a bit more snobby, and tries to be trendy and upscale, but that is just how Gilbert is.  Go to the original location in Mesa.  It's so much more down to earth and authentic.  They make the food better up there too."}
{"text":"This location is the real deal.  Whenever I have friends or family come in from out of town, I take them here to get a taste of authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"My first time here and this will be my go-to taco place for a quick bite from now on.  I couldn't give it five stars because I ordered one steak and one chicken taco and got two steak tacos, but they were excellent steak tacos.  The seasoning for the steak was delicious and the tacos were pretty reasonably priced for the quality.  I liked the condiments bar with multiple types of salsa.  The salsa that come with the chips and salsa was okay, but the ones at the condiment bar made up for that.  The tacos were the real star here.  Can't wait to come back and try something else."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was tasty. Papa Loca is worth a shot if you like mashed potatoe yumminess"}
{"text":"\"I prefer my Mexican food to have a little bit of an animal that suffered a little bit. That's some of the best food.\" ? George Lopez

Brace yourself for fierce mesquite meats.  It's like having coal-cooked meat kick you in your mouthpants.

The smell of meat cooking over coals... oh man!  So first things first, be careful and conservative when using the red sauce because it is hot!  Secondly, get the al pastor tacos.  I always base my taco reviews on how the al pastor is because any time I can get my taco with some pineapple, I'm a happy girl.  Even though I was sniffling and crying from being too liberal with the red sauce, the avocado crema and horchata not cooling down the blazing inferno in my mouth whatsoever, it was so dang tasty.  You can taste the marinade and smokiness even through the heat from the sauce.  Get it on the corn tortillas!  I also got the carne asada, on a flour tortilla, which I'm not mad about.  It was salted heavily and a tad on the drier side so when I come back to BYT, I'll probably get all tacos al pastor.  I also got a bean and cheese tostata to share with my friend just so we can try their beans.  They're were creamy and flavorful!  I like how they put the cheese right on the grill and topped it with beans and another sprinkling of cheese.  

BYT is amazing!  It's probably my favorite place now for tacos.  Parking and seating can be a bit challenging at this location so try popping in at the off-peak times."}
{"text":"They are often very slow, the tacos are fantastic, they are just ok. Now that they are getting the swing of things they are getting a lot quicker. I still prefer Rubios or chipotle."}
{"text":"I live nearby and like to support our-local business. I have been here several times since they opened and keep giving it a chance to improve. The food is ok but I don't want to chase my food and keep wrapping it up. My tacos are soaked in juice and the tortilla falls apart almost immediately. 
My kid's  bean burrito was all on the plate because it was not wrapped properly. There was so much cilantro in the shredded beef taco that we threw most of it out.  

I won't be back anymore, I wish them success."}
{"text":"The food is alright my only real gripe about this spot and the ONLY reason I don't give it 5 stars is the price. For what you get you can find much nicer restaurants around town. This still doesn't deter me from going in here when I am in the area. The food is fresh and the people are nice."}
{"text":"Super busy but worth it ... 
Line went fast and I can see the way they prepared the food. It was quite a an experience . 
I would recommend staying away from lunchtime . 
Enjoyed the salad bar and the sauces there !!"}
{"text":"Amazing salsas. Busy,  but totally worth it! Real meat flavor . 
I have tried pretty much everything on there menu and have liked there combinations. 
Also fast for such a small kitchen !!"}
{"text":"Live right around the corner and love this place.  We usually get the take out family pack and make tacos at home but decided to eat here tonight. Food just can't be beat. Fresh ingredients cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Every time I come to backyard taco they give me the same great quality time after time. No matter how busy they get (and they can get really busy!) it's the cutest place for a date at night because of the pretty lights and music"}
{"text":"Ran in for a fast chicken tostada and it was very good the food was fresh and the place was clean . The staff is very friendly and the prices are spot on , if you haven't tried Backyard Taco give it a try you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"A small family restaurant that has proved to be the best! I go here all the time and will be a long term customer!"}
{"text":"Awesome tacos best in Arizona hands down. I had the carne asada tacos, the quesadilla and a vampiro. Quesadilla was least favorite of all 3 due to tortilla tasting like store bought instead of homemade. We will definitely be back every week
To this establishment. Highly recommend the vampiro"}
{"text":"Great street tacos and LOVE their horchata. Their salsa bar is pretty good as well. Hit 'me up for taco Tuesday!"}
{"text":"Backyard Taco certainly lives up to it's  name and authentic Mexican food.  So busy at lunch time, the racks of meat that are grilling right in front of you are amazing and the team  there works like a well-oiled machine. I had the tostadas and my husband had the steak taco and the chicken burrito that was massive. They have a salsa bar that you can go to and get a lot of different flavors of salsa. Definitely a place to stop by and as you're checking in n Yelp, make sure you get your free chips and salsa. What I would really like to see from a company like this just to get rid of the styrofoam, everything was on styrofoam and could easily be replaced with recycled containers and serving plates along with drink cups. With our landfills filling up and styrofoam not breaking down we need to learn to recycle more, then this place would definitely get five stars"}
{"text":"This will now be my go to taco shop. Al pastor tacos were on point. The pork was marinated to perfection. Every bite just stimulated my taste buds. YUM! I HIGHLY recommend the crazy potato. That was delicious AF. The potato was soft and melted in your mouth. This place is bar far one of the best in Mesa."}
{"text":"3 is too low; I would actually give this a 3.5 but can't do a 4. I had very high hopes and I thought it was pretty overrated. The chicken was so-so and the carne asada was too bland for me. The kicker though is it's good enough to go back (probably alot) because of the price. They are pretty inexpensive and good enough that it's worth the trip. The carne asada was better but use salsa and guacamole to give it flavor. But even those were a little disappointing. The bottled soda is a huge positive and it is a cool little place and has a unique atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great authentic flavors.  Always good food.  I always get the carne asada.  Great hardwood charcoal cooking and the chicken is great also.  Pastor and cabeza.....mmm good.  Fine chopped cabbage and onions and  the guacamole and salsa is great also"}
{"text":"Great food. I had the tacos. Adobada pork with pineapple was on point .  Fresh made and the chicken was fantastic as well!"}
{"text":"This place is great! The outdoor seating is awesome, the service is quick & friendly & The food is delicious!!! Everything on the menu is a la cart so you can put together your own meals. I'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"First of alll Edwin was amazing! He put me on to the limonada and jamaica mix! Oh my, my, my! On a hot summer day it will quench that spot, yessss! Cool taco shop ambiance too! Everyone is friendly and in a great mood except for this screaming child sitting next to us now... wait she stopped crying PTL! It's packed in here and great vibes all around. On to the food... Amaz-balls! My favorites are the chicken and the other one I didn't order, but absolutely loved! The salsa bar is refreshed often and every single item on it was delicious to me! The end."}
{"text":"OK, so yes these are decent tacos... Would I call them 100% authentic... Absolutely not. They are pretty good but i'm not raving and making the drive every weekend. If you've only had taco bell and Filibertos and are comparing them to those then yes you'll fall in love with backyard. If your a Taco connoisseur (hahaha) like me and your looking for bomb street tacos, this will hold you over till you start the search again. I've only found 1 place in mesa that makes tacos to die for, and this isn't it. The restaurant was small and cramped. The salsa bar was messy as hell. I Literally ordered one of pretty much everything because I heard this was \"THE SPOT FOR TACOS\" and wasn't impressed. The only thing I enjoyed was the bite of my daughters chicken burrito, the chicken had good flavor. The only thing authentic was a couple of the Mexicans in the back..."}
{"text":"Mesquite grilled meats-what else needs to be said!  Food is great gets really busy at lunch time from what I can tell from visiting a few times."}
{"text":"I would give this a 0 star if I could. I have been to a few white wash Mexican places but this was the worst. The salsa wasn't even good & I tried all of them. Way over priced. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  That's hard to say about tacos in AZ, but this place does their meats right over a wood fired grill. It makes a huge difference in flavor!!  The salsa bar is fresh and their house salsa is excellent"}
{"text":"Best tacos EVER. I'm not a taco person, but I still find myself craving the carne asada at least once a month. I love the guacamole, too."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place. Consistency is something I greatly appreciate and Backyard Taco never fails me in that department. The restaurant is small, but clean and comfortable. Lord have mercy, the carne asada tacos with corn tortillas are to die for. Paired with the jalapeño sauce, yes please. The staff is very busy, which can be off putting, but the service is quick so I don't feel the need to complain. Love this place to death!"}
{"text":"Would love to eat there more but no salads?  The menu would be great if there was a salad to choose.  We live in the neighborhood where this is located and would go there over someburros or chipotle.

Update:  I changed from 2 to 5 stars since owner responded.  Thank you for reading review and even though your response was somewhat rude I appreciate you responding of considering salads. Having the customers ask the front counter staff if they have salads on every visit isn't useful because many times it doesn't get on to the owner.  Yelp is a forum to give feedback and that's what I used it to do.  You, as an owner, should always be looking for feedback from customers.  Having healthy alternatives is not a horrible thing for a customer to ask for.  Not like I suggested Sushi..."}
{"text":"I love their tacos! This place is so cute and the food is great. They are frequently busy but I don't mind the wait. I've found they this is the best place for quick authentic Mexican food in this area of Mesa. I'm so glad they are around the corner!"}
{"text":"Backyard Taco was recommended to me by some locals while I was on a business trip. These tacos did NOT disappoint! I even came back three times during my week-long stay. Make sure to try to avocado cream!"}
{"text":"Small,simple, clean and very very tasty! I have to go out of my way to enjoy this place and it's so worth it."}
{"text":"Overrated. Portions are small and taste, while different, wasn't above average. Tries to be trendy but this is not a step above fast food."}
{"text":"I hate myself sometimes when trying a new taco place, I tend to claim \"this is my new favorite.\"  I guess I need to develop a new rigorous grading scale when trying new taco joints.  Maybe its some underlying factors that triggers my favoritism towards new places? Who knows.

Just before entering the shop, I saw crowds sitting outside gleefully chomping away.  Peeping through the window were \"hangry\" folks waiting to order.  These clues made it obvious that I came to the right place.

Once I entered the building, there was a frenzy of people getting their food and grabbing utensils and sauces.  Luckily the line wasn't intolerable that my stomach would throw a fit.  The smell of grilled meat only salivated the hunger even more.

The menu isn't so big but it offers plenty to satisfy your faux Mexican taste buds.  Of course I had to get the tacos as a first timer.  I went for the usual Carne Asada and the Birria (recommended by the staff).  While the Carne Asada tacos were cooked and tasted perfectly, I now favor the Birria.  To describe it, its got a nice crunchy texture with some deep flavors.  But you have to complement it with its fire hot sauce.  Boy did it burn.  I like a burn like this every now and then.

You have to wash it down with either a Mexican Coke and something really sweet to counter the burn.

If this review doesn't scream at you, then surely the number of stars will."}
{"text":"This place is great. REAL Mexican food and the portions are good. It's what you should expect coming to a taco stand.

Unfortunately they don't take AMEX which is a huge bummer, so they lose a star there. Also, the prices can be a smidge too high for the tacos, but the other stuff is well worth it.

Needless to say, we've been back a few times since our first visit and will continue to go back for more in the future."}
{"text":"We love taco Tuesdays here. Their tacos taste just like the authentic ones you find in Mexico. The salsa options are also spot on. Taco Tuesdays!"}
{"text":"Our new favorite place for tacos! They were amazing! The carne asada tacos were just like in Mexico."}
{"text":"Good...not great.  Carne Asada taco's were average.  Al Pastor burro average also.  No real flavor to the meet except for the odd piece of what I believe was pineapple.  Real sticking point was price...$15 for one burro, 2 tacos and a large soda.  Not convinced it was worth it."}
{"text":"This is a clean and friendly neighborhood taco joint; it's open late and worth the drive! Everything from the carne asada tacos to the chicken crazy potato are worth the short wait in line. But the best part of the deal, and what I measure a Mexican venue by, is the salsa bar. And Backyard taco has the best hot sauce around! I brought some back to my neighbor who professes to know all the best Mexican places in town. To give you a little background, she's a top Mexican chef with an extended Mexican family here in the Valley. And when she tried the sauce I brought back for her, her eyes lit up and she immediately asked me where I got it. Backyard Taco is a great place to satisfy your foodie cravings that's friendly enough for your entire family. Check it out, you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Delicious tacos!! I love the salsas specially the green one,  which I think it has avocado. I go here very often and it's always full of people.  I wish the place was bigger but other than that it's great.  The location is good they have their own parking lot, washrooms and all the necessary.  The service is ok I mean they are good I understand they have a lot of people."}
{"text":"Great Tacos. The Salsa Bar is Awesome. 
Needs more parking place is always Crowded! 

Everything at this location has failed. Glad to see it wasn't the location. You guys Rock."}
{"text":"Yum best street tacos ever...and on Tuesdays it's even cheaper. 1.80$ tacos you can't get much better than that. Def recommend this to everyone I know"}
{"text":"Love this place in Mesa, I'm glad it's in Gilbert now. Definitely get a beer before you arrive and expect a wait! They just opened with new staff so be patient! They'll catch on soon enough. I hope."}
{"text":"Like going to Mexico for tacos. Yuummooo! The only negative is the ambiance. Very sterile looking. Needs a nice covered patio. I always pick up to go. Besides that service is good and I highly recommend the food.  And we all know its about the food!"}
{"text":"Went back again this weekend- the service was much better. Carne asada tacos are still delicious. Papa loca is great- packed with lots of meat."}
{"text":"This place is semi okay! Idk I wasn't in love with the food like everyone made it out to be!  It was good, clean and overall satisfied but the tacos were tiny and we didn't know so we only ordered 1 and the quesadilla had Aton of onions."}
{"text":"This place is pretty legit! The carne asada and shredded beef are really good but the chicken is pretty bland so stick to the beef! The horchata is also . The parking is tricky at this location, the lot is tiny and the place gets busy so we had to park across the street but it wasn't a big deal. Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"Wow!! This was a Hallelujah moment when bitting into their barbacoa taco! The mean was juicy and soft with great flavor! My husband got the chicken burrito and his chicken was just awesome! It was slow cooked pulled chicken so it had tons of flavor too! The burrito was a big burrito! So happy my friend recommended we come here for lunch"}
