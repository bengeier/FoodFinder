{"text":"Let's start with the beer, which was specially made for every college jock who has ever questioned, \"why doesn't my coffee stout actually taste like coffee?\" You're in luck young jock, their stout taste just like coffee. Their Albino Stout, just like diabetic toffee with light undertones of beer. The Jake tastes just like your gym friend Jake. And the other beers are on the menu which are described as \"drinkable\" are surprisingly drinkable because they lack character.  Any brewery can get their beer wrong, but their food on Yelp looked so right... and that's where it ended. I saw luscious photos of their salt pestatio and goat cheese beets, but the generous and oh so beautiful to look at amount of goat cheese was bitter and tasteless. Their scallops were topped with the fruity awfulness found in fruit cake. However, their bacon wrapped dates, topped with piquillo pepper sauce, get a B+ for creativity. These dates taste like and almost as good as a sausage so much so that it made me pause and admire at the flavor combination.   I came on a Friday night so I don't mind the half-hearted service, but I really felt bad for the manager who served me a couple of my dishes. You could tell that she really cared about the place, but she was the only one.  I can't entirely blame the staff for being burnt out considering their customer base. This restaurant is a Dave and Buster's all American fun house which attempts to be so much more. It is pornography to the eyes, but, like cheap porn, it is truly unsatisfying. [Insert college jock joke here]. Perhaps this spot is so popular because, through aesthetics, it makes young adults feel good about being trendy."}
{"text":"We are from out of town and  tried downtown on a local's recommendation.  The food was great . Started off with  the sliders which  had great beef flavor. Then the flatbread was excellent.  The highlight of the evening was the grilled scallops with celery root along with raisins and pistachios. We love grilled scallops but this sounded a little out there for us.  They were absolutely fabulous.  The broccolini was great too.  Scott the waiter was awesome and very helpful.  Good craft beers too!"}
{"text":"Read the previous reviews and most of them contained elements of my review - inside noise crazy loud - outside patio nice ambiance - drinks well done - food looks great - value missing 2 small pieces of cheese $4 - ordered  the MVP based on the severs recommendation - Steak was the MVP requested it be cooked based on the Chef's preference - came out medium rare only problem it was cold - sent it back instead of a new entree they reheated the sent back plate - the result Luke warm medium steak - the service was poor and the overall experience underwhelming"}
{"text":"Stopped by Butcher & the Brewer for the 1st time last night & loved it! We were able to grab a spot at the bar no problem & were greeted shortly thereafter by an extremely cute bartender, 'Tinnie' (sp?).   I ordered a German draft, The Repeater, & the smoked lamb ribs. The ribs were good (just a little fatty for me), the beer was excellent & the service was even better!  Unfortunately, we didn't have time to stay very long; however, I will definitely make it a point to stop by this place again!"}
{"text":"Fantastic beer and food. We got a cozy spot at the bar and got great recommendations from our server. She let us know that the menu items are all small to medium plates so that three things split between the two of us was the way to go. Perfect! We got the mushroom flatbread which was delicious... but the stars were the tempura cauliflower and the charred broccolini. So good! Wish I lived nearby so I had an opportunity to go back."}
{"text":"The shrimp and grits were amazing along with the pierogi flatbread! We ordered a meat and cheese board to start with and it did not disappoint. The albino stout was also very good! Definitely a spot we need to get back to."}
{"text":"I went here with my boyfriend for dinner and drinks. I'm happy they have call ahead seating and would recommend that is the best way to go about trying this place. We were seated right when we arrived.  The only downside to our experience was the community seating. Next time I would prefer a table. It was hard to hear each other and I often felt like I was competing to talk with the party seated next to me.  That being said, the food was amazing. I had the shrimp and grits and my boyfriend had a burger. We also ordered a board of meat and cheeses. Everything was a good portion size. I know there are a lot of other places that serve more food for the price, but it was nice to have a proper portion and not too much food.   Overall, the atmosphere was great and I look forward to trying more of their beers next time I visit."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Awesome Midwest mule. Great staff. Selection of food was slim and just ok. I would go back for drinks and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Not a great experience. Place is very, very loud. Food was good except for the very burnt toast sent with Steak Tartare and Bread & Slather."}
{"text":"The food was good but the service was terrible. It took two hours to get three appetizers. I understand it was a busy Thursday night but two hours to get appetizers is a bit ridiculous. The waitress offered to give us a free round of drinks but that didn't help considering we had an event we were going to and were late to because of their slow service."}
{"text":"The beer was fantastic and my wife ordered the snapper. Also fantastic. We also ordered the bacon wrapped dates...again, fantastic.  I ordered steak.  It was...NOT fantastic. While it had excellent flavor it was chewy and stringy. With a $36 price tag I expected more.  We'll definitely visit again but will like confine our ordering to beer and small plates."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great food and great service! We ordered the chorizo flatbread, beef sliders and the pretzel bites. I didn't think it would be enough for my husband and I, but it was plenty!"}
{"text":"I've been here for dinner before, but came here on this occasion for late night drinks. The first thing that strikes you is the ambiance- very contemporary and maybe even swanky. Sat at the bar and found that service was kind of slow, although it was on the crowded side. Had the midwest mule and did not enjoy it at all, the bourbon was way too strong. However I also ordered the s'more for dessert which wasn't bad although also wasn't anything to rave about. There is a large dining space and therefore good for groups. I really liked the venue so would still give this place another chance."}
{"text":"My fianc√©e and I went up to Cleveland for my birthday weekend and she took me to this place. I have to say that this place is pretty awesome. First of all, I'm not really a beer drinker but I decided to try their Albino Stout, which is a light colored stout unlike Guinness or any milk stouts. It was creamy and smooth and just the best beer I've probably ever put in my mouth. I let my tongue swim in the stout while in my mouth. Our server was amazing! The food was outstanding. The steak tartare was soooo good! I've had steak tartare in Paris, and this just might blow any tartare I've tried in Paris out of the water!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. The tacos were awesome! Beer is amazing! Really cool atmosphere. Loved going downstairs to see brewery. Great if your looking to get some delicious food before the game."}
{"text":"Was in town for a convention and came here for a casual dinner and a pint or two.  Highlight was the IPA. For dinner I ordered a salad, 18 oz prime rib, and Brussels sprouts. I then closed out with the albino stout just to see what it was all about.  The salad was above average, the prime rib was not priced on the menu and probably a good thing because I never would have ordered s $60 steak from s BREW PUB.  To boot the prime rib was overly fatty.  Brussels sprouts were good but didn't make up for the steak.  The albino stout tasted like a cream ale with vanilla flavoring.  Overall I felt ripped off and should have known better to ask the waitress  what the price of the \"special\" steak was."}
{"text":"Best spot in Cleveland. The sliders and calamari  are surreal. You will say \"Oh my god\" at least twenty times. Best brews hands down. Go here or you will surely regret it."}
{"text":"Josh is a marvelous butcher at this terrific Butcher Shop.  We ordered in advance our turkey for Thanksgiving, maple thick sliced bacon, beef tenderloins, and two whole chickens.  Everything was exceptionally delicious and Josh was so accommodating.  We had a week of great feasting with our family. Thank you!! We will be back.  PS-Also their aged bone in ribeye--fantastic!!"}
{"text":"Was visiting from Chicago and this was one of the few places serving food late night around 12am on E. 4th so my boyfriend and I decided to walk in. Host was very welcoming and explained the menu to us right when we sat down. Our waiter Mikey, was attentive and made drink recommendations we enjoyed. We ordered the beef tartare and mushroom pizza which were out of sight. The sliders could've used a little bit more sauce and maybe onions. Beer sample presentation was very original. We thought it was a great price for flights (4 samplers for $10). Also, they have wine drafts!!! Need I say more. We will for sure be back."}
{"text":"The corn dogs were smoked to perfection and the Albino Stout was the perfect complement. Great service"}
{"text":"Can't say enough about the beer at this place.  There's real dedication, skill, and pride behind every brew, and lots of creative options and styles you don't see everywhere.    The atmosphere is always welcoming, bartenders and wait staff are friendly, and I have only eaten there once (mostly because I wait to long to reserve a table) but my burger was great."}
{"text":"Great house brewed beer selection, the place is packed during the weekends. However, food is a bit mediocre except for the loaded fries. Service can be cold sometimes."}
{"text":"We came on a Saturday night at six, so prior to the rush.  We each had a beer, brewed on site. I had the hefewiesen and my wife had the raspberry beer.  Both were  good.    The place serves small plates, tapas.  We had the green beans, steelhead trout, corn dogs and smoked lamb ribs.  The food was very good, but not spectacular.    The service was attentive and knowledgeable.  The restaurant is very loud, so be prepared.  The seating is communal and the plates are made for sharing, It would be a fun place for larger groups.  They butcher all of their meats on premise.  We enjoyed our visit although I might not come without a larger group."}
{"text":"While they might have to sort out some growing pains as a brand new place, I can overlook that as the staff is polite and the food was both prompt and delicious. All of this is minor considering this place makes the most unique beer I've had in Cleveland, and possibly ever. I has two selections; the first was the farmhouse rouge which I can say is the best farmhouse I've has ever. For desert I had the hefeweizen which was the most excited I've been for a weizen in about ten years. Tasteful notes of banana and clove, yum! Definitely going to be back to see how this unfolds."}
{"text":"Visiting from Seattle I wanted to try some local food and beer, since Seattle is full of micro breweries and culinary gems.  Here's what I found:  Delicious house made brews, house cured meats and great service.           Never mind the price ( you get what you pay for) I had the burger and it was cooked medium perfectly, I added bacon and a perfectly cooked over easy egg, so much flavor from this juicy, cheesy masterpiece.  We also tried a few things off the Cured & Cultured menu: Pat√© Champagne, Jagerwurst and Red Rock Cheddar.  Everything was extremely well presented and had the flavor to match!  The Stop Hop Kaboom was a great American IPA brewed right there in house and perfectly washed everything down.       Hold on to this gem Cleveland!  If you don't, Seattle will gladly take them off your hands. Oh and the malt vinegar aioli is a must try!"}
{"text":"Pretentious.  This is Cleveland not NYC. Wait staff was unfriendly and condescending. Left before apps were even brought out. Had one great cocktail but couldn't get past the attempts to be hipster. Went across street to Greenhouse Tavern. Much better!"}
{"text":"Awesome beers. Good service and cool vibe. Didn't eat here because I just had lunch but food smelled amazing."}
{"text":"Butcher & The Brewer is a great place to come have drinks and eat very good food with a group of people. The entire bar has long tables so you are always seated closely with another group of people. It's a great atmosphere! I recently went before a Cavs game, and we got the Pork shank and the corn dogs. Delicious! I always get the Banana beer as well. If you are walking down East fourth, i highly reccomend to stop here."}
{"text":"The staff was so nice! The waitress took great care of us and made sure we liked our food. The service was fast and top of the line. Everyone was willing and happy to help us with whatever we needed even though we probably didn't fit the type of crowd they usually draw in. The beer was amazing and I don't usually drink beer. The bar food was presented well. It felt very upscale. The atmosphere was comfortable and lighting was dim which is relaxing. Beautiful wood floors and tables. The brewery they have inside of the bar is unbelievable. Great one of a kind experience."}
{"text":"Super great food and really unique beer selection. With some funny names. A la beans above the frank or the French toast.   Food was delicious and the atmosphere was excellent. I really enjoyed this spot and loved the communal tables especially when eating alone.   My only gripe service was slooow, but it was full and I went in 25 min after a playoff home Cavs game started.   I'd come here again."}
{"text":"i have lives in downtown cleveland for over  6 years.  the brewery/restaurant scene has taken over.  for a place that just opened the service was great and fast although i probably beat the rush on a friday as i ate dinner at 5-6pm.  with the name of the restaurant being \"BUTCHER and the brewer\" i would have expected more meat entree options.  my group ordered the mac n cheese, kimchee chicken wings, the burger, and taco appetizer.  they were all very delicious, and each one had their own unique twist- wings were spicy w kimchee, burger served with their own homemade ketchup and relish.....my buddy and i got a couple beer samplers to try their beer. we liked the farmhouse rogue beer the best- strong but tasty, nice aftertaste.  it is a big open space, VERY loud (which i dont mind, but it depends what you are looking for), lots of people.....decor is refreshingly unique to cleveland. made me feel like i was in a bigger city.  cool new addition to cleveland.  will go back time to time with friends.   hit up society bar afterwards.  heard butcher and brewer will eventually have their own speak easy downstairs, so that will be cool!"}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of visiting Downtown Cleveland at the Butcher & The Brewer on 10/02/2015....didn't know what to expect but that in itself was a treat.....the drinks and food were AWESOME!  Our bartender Kristen suggested some really good ones and each one you thought it couldn't get any better but it did.....I love my libations the food is just a bonus but the  put the 2 together and OMG.....I recommend this laid back atmosphere if your looking for something to do on Friday night......I'll be back!"}
{"text":"A group of old geezers showed up for a beer before a concert and the hospitality was exceptional and so was the albino stout - one of the best beers I've ever had, no joke.  And if your server is Leslie, you are in for a treat - tip her well, she'll deserve it."}
{"text":"Excellent beers--hoppy (at least the ones we tried) with great flavors. Definitely a 5 for that!! Food was pretty good--definitely enjoyed the patatas bravado with chorizo and Mac and cheese. The patatas after a while we're super heavy and salty (maybe the aioli), but did the trick. Mac and cheese was super creamy."}
{"text":"To start, the service was great and the staff was very friendly.  We were seated quickly, our order was promptly taken, and the drinks were out quickly, followed by the food.  However, I didn't realize we were in mid-town Manhattan.  I take no issue with the prices for drinks ($5 or so for a pint of their own brew).  Their beer was very good (I ordered the FRAMBOYZEE), and I would go back for a drink if in the area.  To start off, we ordered bacon-wrapped dates as an appeteizer ($8) and received 3 small dates.  This was not enough to share among two people, nor does the menu tell you the $8 price-tag is for 3 small dates.  Ok, its just a \"bar bite\", we'll move on.    Next, my wife ordered a $12 flatbread, it was large enough for one person, but the quality was average at best.  I on the other hand, ordered the Hand-Ground Burger ($12) and added bacon ($2), so the total for my burger was $14.  I received one piece of bacon cut in half, and NO SIDES.  I guess it is my fault for assuming that for $14 in Cleveland, I would have received a side of some sort with my meal, but no, my plate came out with just a burger on it, no lettuce, no tomato, nothing.  I have ordered burgers in San Francisco, Chicago, NY, etc. for the same price (or less) and always received a side.  The burger was good, but not $14 by itself good.  To end, nothing but positive things to say about the staff and service.  But the quality and quantity of food you receive is NOT worth the price.  Go for a drink, enjoy the atmosphere, but head somewhere else to eat."}
{"text":"The food was really really good. I would definitely  recommend the bacon & eggs and the corn dogs. The brews were really solid too. My issue I had was with the wait staff. Some of our friends at the table weren't drinking as much as others and felt neglected. Kelly our waitress only came over to check on us \"maybe\" a handful of times and by the time she came over we weren't able to tell her about the ribs we never got because we were so full. The biggest shocker and disappoint was the 20% gratuity being added on there already when we got the bill. I know there was 8 of us but no where did it say that party of a certain number would have gratuity already added(I check to see the menu to see if it said it). I just felt like we were trying to be tricked because we were younger looking. To say the least I was completely turned off by the service we had and don't think I will be coming back because of it. Really was hoping for a better experience and the food is killer oh well now we know :("}
{"text":"Came in before Cavs game. First time in Cleveland and enjoyed this area of town. We ordered the hamburger (teen didn't like - tasted funny but we thought it was fine), bacon wrapped dates was excellent, the Brussels sprouts were good but nothing special, shrimp and grits -excellent and the chorizo flatbread was very good."}
{"text":"Another new downtown \"gem\" for Cleveland, created by true local talent.  The atmosphere is unique, and rowdy.   Don't come here for a romantic meal.   Long tables that you share with others.   But fun, to talk about the food and drink with neighbors on your table.   The basement is worth a tour, with its unique restroom and all the brew kettles on display in a low blue light.   Beautiful.     Beer offerings were varied and all good.   Try the 4-for-$10 flight option, to taste four 5-oz samples.   Great way to find one you like.   The food offerings were creative and also varied, although, not one true salad on the entire menu.   So don't expect salads and be disappointed.  Everything is tapas style, a la carte.    The steak tartare was excellent, as was the calamari.   Note, the calamari has a mayonnaise based glaze on the plate.  Brussel sprouts were fabulous.   And the smoked lamb ribs were great too.   Didn't have one bad item in our order.   Ate and drank full meal for two, and ended up under $80 before tip."}
{"text":"Good location, good beer and friendly staff with a great patio. Definitely come back next time in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of communal dinners, but this was totally unexpected!!  There were so many one of a kind dishes to choose from, which made it even more enjoyable to share!!  ABSOLUTELY LOVED everything about this restaurant!  Highly recommend to anyone, especially if you are looking for something different!!"}
{"text":"Of all the restaurants in the Gateway District, this is my favorite. The menu items are \"small plates\" (think tapas) intended for sharing. Everything I have ever tried has been very good. The service is great when it is not crowded, and good when it is crowded. The craft beers cover a spectrum, so you can find one you really like. In fact, their beer flights are reasonably priced so you can sample 5 of their offerings to help you decide.  My favorite dish is the pork shank. It is literally fall-off-the-bone tender, and you can tell it has not been boiled because it is so tasty.  Don't go y yourself. Take a crowd. They can handle it, and you will have lots of fun. Oh, and the bathrooms are funny."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times just for drinks, but finally tried the food last weekend. As far as the beer goes, I'm not wowed. It's definitely not my fave brewery in the area. I hope they bring back the Albino Stout because it's delicious, but the other 6-7 ones I've tried have been average, nothing special. I would say they are on par with Market Garden, which again, is just average. I would go to Platform or Nano over B&B for just beer.   The food, on the other hand, is very tasty and I like that they offer sharable plates. Though, if you go with people who have food issues or don't like to share, that could be an issue. Our group tried the mussels (delicious, the cheese was an unusual, but yummy complement), the sausage flatbread with broccolini (could eat it every day), and the patatas bravas (loved the slightly spicy sauce). The other couple ordered two of the large sharable entrees, fried chicken and pork shank, and the portions were definitely generous enough to share between four people. Trying a bit of each, the fried chicken was okay on its own but definitely needed the help of the jalapeno syrup (though it really didn't have much sweetness, more vinegar if anything), but the pork shank was very flavorful. I would definitely get that on a return trip. I would just skip the fried chicken.  Note: I was tempted by the corn dogs, but when I saw them go by and noticed only three in a serving we skipped it. Same goes for the sliders. Splitting three items between two or four people is a pain. I don't understand that decision at all.  Also, I noticed that the TVs were in color on this last visit. While it's odd to watch sports in B&W, it was kind of cool on my first couple visits.  I feel like giving a 4-star review would be too much, but three stars is too low. Wish there was a 3.5-star rating."}
{"text":"Great craft beer selection, and atmosphere.  Food is good but pricey.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We were in Cleveland for a short visit. Had dinner at this restaurant and give it 5 stars. Our waiter went out of his way to  accommodate our needs and recommended great drinks. The manager's middle name must be \"hospitality\"  Be sure to stop by Brewer and the Butcher. You will be thrilled that you did. Enjoy great food and a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"ok I dig the beer and decor. But the service and food....just abysmal. I love when a new restaurant is around and has potential but until they teach their wait staff how to be respectful and kind, I will not come back.   Before I drove over around 10:45 I checked to see what time they closed which was 1am. However when I showed up there weren't too many people at the bar so asked again what time they were going to close. \"1am technically but maybe 12 tonight\" said the waitress. OK, great, I have an hour to eat and have a drink. After I already ordered my food and drink she says they are now closing at 11:45, drops my check and shuts off the music. I didn't even make through half of my plate and it was 11:20 when she dropped the check.   I am just appalled at the lack of customer service. This all coming from someone who has been waiting tables and bar tending for a few years. You can tell if someone just wants to have a pleasant bite to eat or is intentionally keeping a party there to drink past store hours.   no thank you."}
{"text":"Ended up there for beer week. Atmosphere is great although pretty loud. Had the calamari, octopus, and wings appetizers. First two were really good bites though small portions. Wings were spicy but not special. Looking forward to them opening up the butcher shop."}
{"text":"I agree with others who like the atmosphere. It is loud, very loud, but that can be fun. I Can't remember exactly what I had but my impression was that it's really overpriced for the quality and quantity of food. Someone said they paid $65 per couple and left feeling hungry. Yep, that sounds about right."}
{"text":"all i can say is albino stout!!!!! game changer. also bartenders are extremely knowledgeable."}
{"text":"We got the roasted chicken, asparagus salad, flatbreads and Mac n cheese. All were very good but it was so loud! They need to do something about that."}
{"text":"We just came in and had the corn dog appetizer and a few drinks. They were all good. What we didn't like was the noise level was EXTREMELY loud! Also, it would be nice if the servers wore shirts that said the restaurant name. They all had on different things and there were so many people in there that you had NO clue who to try to get their attention! It was a little confusing. I think we just like more quiet places. It was only ~ 5 p.m., but the noise was just too much for us!"}
{"text":"Food was ok as was service. But menu is odd and wine had sediment. Was told this is normal."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a very enjoyable experience here last night. The food quality, taste and presentation were excellent. Service was perfect and the manager comp'd us a couple small plates because we had met him previously when he previously owned the ice cream shop Sweety Fries in Cleveland Heights. It was my birthday so the server brought me a free delicious chocolate mousse dessert too. The only thing disappointing about our experience was that I didn't think the beers were that great. I'm a lover of big hoppy ales, like IPAs and they didn't have any.  I got a beer sampler and a couple of the beers were ok, but nothing really impressive."}
{"text":"Alyssa was amazing and  knowledgeable, recommended some amazing items. Food was spectacular. Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"Left feeling unsatisfied and short changed at what food I got for the money. \"Family style\" is bs, I'd stay at home if I wanted that. The beer was good though, and obviously a good location. I would not go back unless it was just for a beer and to sit ourside."}
{"text":"It was very loud which is pretty typical considering this is a bar. The restaurant has a very different look to it. Apparently they like you to enjoy your meal family style which was pretty appropriate. We loved the Mac and cheese and tacos, not huge fans of The lobster 'roll'. I would go back just to have the Mac and cheese and tacos again, totally worth it."}
{"text":"A group of us went for the first time on a slow Monday night.  And once again we followed other Yelpers advise and ordered certain high ranking dishes.  So... you gotta try the sliders!!!  They are out of this world good!  I don't know what they season the meat with but it is delicious! All of us were impressed with the sliders!  The patatas bravas ( potatoes and chorizo )  was also a big hit with our group! We also tried the sushito peppers..don't be scared...try them!  They are not too spicy and I hate blue cheese, but this doesn't have that strong odor or flavor of blue cheese - super yummy.   The pierogi pizza was - meh.  We've had different other potato pizzas that were better. The server we had was very accommodating and friendly ( good Midwest guy !)  It has dim lighting there, but we didn't think it was too dark to read the menu etc... The bathrooms might throw you for a loop when you see everybody and there brother washing hands in the same area! heeheehee - just FYI. The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the price.  I have seen others mention the same thing.  Since we all went to East 4th street we know that the restaurants are higher end so we don't mind paying - but it doesn't seem like you get enough bang for your buck.  Great food, but just not enough for what you pay. So hopefully the owners take note of the comments and add another slider to the plate. : )"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great beer, great food, great vibe. The scallops are crazy good. Service is always was top notch, too. Very friendly and attentive. Been here multiple times and the place is just consistently great!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes but won't be coming back. Both wings and pork shank were dry - usually cooked too fast at to high a temp.  Beer was great. Service was meh. I'm sure this place is hopping after games but you'll pay extra - pork shank was $27!  There are other better places nearby."}
{"text":"When the bathroom is the best thing about a restaurant, you know there's a problem.  I went here on Friday night with my husband and another couple. The front desk folks were friendly but a little unorganized, but hey, it's only been open a week, so I was ready to be forgiving.   The best word to describe our server was apathetic. She didn't seemed to want to be there, and definitely didn't care enough to sell us on the place - no overview of the menu, no recommendations, just \"so what do you want?\" Really odd for a new restaurant.  We ordered the loaded fries and tempura asparagus to start. Fries came out wrong (gave us the other fry option on the menu instead of what we ordered), but either way, the fries were not impressive - looked like they came from a frozen bag. Asparagus, however, was AMAZING. Definitely recommend it.  I ordered the mussels, my husband ordered the lamb ribs, my friend ordered the mussels and her boyfriend got the pork shank. The mussels were small in both size and in the number that they gave you (I think we counted 10). The flavor was lacking, one was not cooked and this was definitely not an entree size for the price! Aren't these supposed to be the same people who run Tremont Taphouse?! Their mussels are so much better in flavor, size and price!  The lamb ribs were overcooked and also not worth the price. The shank was the only entree that seemed to be match up to the quality we expected for the price we paid.  Unfortunately, this place already seems to be underperforming based on what the menu's prices would suggest it thinks it is worth. Usually, I would give a place like this a second chance, but unless they overhaul the menu, there's no point (note: I will make an exception for a beer and some tempura asparagus at happy hour)."}
{"text":"We loved this restaurant!  Overall, the staff was helpful and friendly.  Our server helped us figure out the right amount of food for our group of 5.  The food came quickly, but was spaced out well so we could enjoy it all.  Everything was delicious - especially the underdog, the tempura cauliflower.  We all would highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Ok. I'm giving 4 stars because I am hopeful that the whole establishment will earn them at some point. Right now, the Brewery gets 4+ and the restaurant gets less.  Eric is a good brewer with imagination. The narrator's voice of the beer menu is kinda weird, allegedly preferring few words, yet offering decent descriptions of the beers. There's good stuff going on here, I wish it was a bit cheaper, but I don't feel ripped off for what you get. The flights are way overpriced though.  I met the Butcher (or is it just \"butcher\"? why no definite article for THE butcher?), Rex, who seems like a knowledgeable good dude who is doing great things with sourcing their meats from quality farms and using whole animals. Cool.  The food from the restaurant is nice. However, small plates are the worst. They're $7-12 and you have to order 3 to not walk out hungry. Too much money. Too little food. Restaurants should stop pretending small plates are cool. They're just a way to rip off the diner. Boo.  So where does this leave us??? It's high time E4 got a brewery, and it's high time Cleveland got a brewery doing some of the weirder, Belgian inspired stuff that Eric is doing. It's high time we got a meat shop that legitimately sources their animals well. However, no one anywhere needs those damn \"small plates.\" Ahhh"}
{"text":"Love the farmhouse concept!  The beers were tasty, the pork shank was succulent and the kimchi was a welcome twist to the dish.  Marry those with smooth, knowledgeable service and you have a winning establishment!"}
{"text":"Arrived late into Cleveland with hopes of finding a decent pub menu and local craft beer. We were well past the dinner hour and the Indians were still in the 7th inning. The bar was full but there were plenty of seats at the communal tables. It took at least 10 minutes to meet our waitress, who then promised to bring us waters. Meanwhile there was plenty of staff and a disinterested manager wandering around that could have easily helped with the simple things.  We ordered drinks and food as soon as she came back with the waters. Again, we waited at least another 10 minutes for our drinks to be brought over from the bar.  The Kale salad was good, maybe a little over dressed. The calamari was flavorful, not too overdone and nicely plated. The sliders were under cooked and buried in so much salt that we had to pull the salted bun off just to make them edible.  Service was a failure overall but not completely the fault of our over worked server. (Although, while waiting for our bill we did catch sight of her checking her phone in the corner.) From our vantage point there were plenty of people to help, just a badly organized situation.  Prepare to pay for the experience too. 2 drinks and a sampling of small dishes ended up costing over $70!"}
{"text":"This place is great! A very fun concept, we liked the \"community dining\" aspect of it. Great selection of beers too!"}
{"text":"I am giving The Butcher and the Brewer a very favorable review, but I do have one issue that I will get into.  First, the craft beer selection has something for everyone.  I was told to get the albino stout and it is now one of my favorites.  Strong hints of vanilla that doesn't make it too heavy.  My wife and friends picked 4 different ones for a sampler.  The shandy was not one of our favorites since it had a little too much citrus in it.  Drinks were fine.  As far as the food we read on the menu that it was intended that everyone share and the servers would bring out the food based on the table's pace.  I was not sure how I would like this, but they have been successful so why not.  Our server also told us the serving style and it seemed a bit weird.  Here is how the orders went: Me - Starter:  Chorizo tacos and Shishito peppers.  Entree:  Smoked Pork Shank Wife - Bacon and eggs and tempura asparagus Friend 1: Starter:  Sliders  Entree:  Roasted chicken Friend 2:  Melon salad and green beens (share the chicken)  First dishes show up and it is the chorizo tacos, shishito peppers and tempura asparagus.  Basically all but the wife and my entrees.  Well, we put it in the middle of the table and everyone dug in.  When you are hungry everyone just goes for it.  I ate one of the tacos and some peppers and they were fantastic.  Well seasoned and great flavors that were unique with the Blue Cheese added.  The asparagus was very lightly done with the tempura and great with two sauces.    Next out is my entree.  What?  My order is complete and everyone is looking at it.  Friends ate my other taco that I would have loved to have.  Hey, we are all sharing.  Next out are the 3 sliders and melon salad ordered by friends.  They each grab one and there is a lone slider that I didn't want to snake.  My wife and I cut it into 3rds, not wanting to look like we were making a land grab.  I got a little bit of the salad and it was one of my favorites with a vinaigrette.    Next out, the bacon and eggs that really don't lend themselves to sharing.  This was closely followed by the chicken and green beans.  Well, I got some of the green beans and tasted my wife's bacon and eggs.  The beans will be ordered again and I might even order the bacon and eggs. Only complaint:  Bacon and eggs didn't really go with the beer.  Otherwise it stands on its own.  Never got the chicken, but it looked great.  So, overall the food was great and plentiful.  But when I order something it is because I have my own taste.  Since my dishes came out first I found myself sharing and only getting some of what I wanted.  I appreciate variety, but I didn't feel like I had the best experience.  I also didn't feel like the server was controlling the food coming out like they said.  It seemed like if it was up in the window it was getting served.  Didn't have a flow.  Atmosphere was simple, but on a Friday night it was a bit loud.  Not a whole lot of flair, but i was there for the food and not the ambiance.  Oh yeah, all of the TV's are black and white.  You will find the food has a unique flair that makes it worth going to.  Just make sure the ground rules are laid out and everyone is on board with the ordering style.  If I go back I will ask that we are served traditionally with appetizers first and entrees all at the same time."}
{"text":"Very attentive service, despite being very busy. Friendly hostess. Food was good, but mostly small plates. If you like tapas, this place will be right in your wheelhouse. The mac & cheese, chorizo stuffed (bacon wrapped) dates, smoked corn dogs were all on point, but I thought the pierogi flatbread was particularly fantastic. I'm a bit of an IPA connoisseur (I've tried hundreds of different ones all over the country), and I was impressed with both the Positively E 4th St and the Stop Hop Kaboom."}
{"text":"Amazeballs! I was given the best welcome by Leslie upon entering this golden treasure, made some of the best drinks by the beautiful and talented Kelly Ann, and had the BEST service from Michelle... and a huge shout out to the kitchen staff who absolutely rocked my socks off! We had the calamari, baked pretzels, shrimp and grits, and sauage flatbread, everthing was top notch. We'll definable be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"Had a weird experience the first time we tried to go here, but management was incredibly gracious about making it right. My fiancee and I went here on a Saturday night, there was a long wait, but we were able to sit at an area by the windows, which was open seating. It was nice to sit next to each other and be able to people watch out onto E. 4th. We started with a beer flight. The portions were very generous and their beers are very interesting and very good. The choice of Vietnamese cinnamon in the holiday ale was particular great twist on that style.   We shared the pierogie pizza and it was really incredible. The crust was perfectly baked and the toppings (especially the creme fraich and the carmelized onions) were on point. Service was good and even though they were busy, the drinks and food came out pretty quickly..  In the interest of full disclosure, due to the aforementioned weird experience the first time, Butcher & The Brewer comped our entire meal, worth about $22. However, I would have gladly paid the bill as everything was really, really good. It's a perfect place to go downtown if you want to split some beer and some food."}
{"text":"I'm tempted to give it 5 stars.  It is very good.  The beer selection is good and lots of delicious food.  Only thing that is strange is that the meals don't really have sides.  They are meant to be shared, so I guess that is cool."}
{"text":"Tonight The Groove Shop traveled to Cleveland to gig out here at the Museum of Modern Art. We were taken care of by Christina - UNBELIEVABLE. Food was killer. Drinks were fantastic. Service was awesome.   Also, shrimp and grits are a must have. Along with the Mac and cheese. And the scallops. And the cauliflower. And the flatbreads. And the wings. And the bacon wrapped dates. And everything else. Thanks for taking care of some traveling musicians! We'll be back.   @silver_pro_entertainment #thegrooveshop #composingthetrend #weddings #livemusic"}
{"text":"Inconsistent... some of the plates (the tacos) were very well balanced and tasty. The lamb ribs were fatty and disappointing. The staff is attentive and helpful. We went there on the early side for dinner and it was not too crowded."}
{"text":"Staff was very unfriendly and snarky and unprofessional. I recommend you take your business and hard earned money elsewhere."}
{"text":"This was the second time I have been there. The first time I went, I didn't known it was tapas style, so I was a little thrown off. But going in this time, I was ready and I genuinely enjoyed my experience much more. The food was delicious and I really enjoyed the pinot noir I got (i know it's known for beer, but I'm not a big beer person). The only reason I give it 4 stars is because it was very loud and kind of hard to talk to the person sitting across from you. I'll definitely be going back though."}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended to us by a friend to hit up before the cavs game. The atmosphere was great and the Mac and Cheese was top 3 all time. The beer needs some work, especially the chocolate albino stout which you should stay away from. The lamb ribs were pretty epic."}
{"text":"$$ Good service not so good food. I was there one week ago and we ordered lamb chops it was terribly small  barely one and a half lamb chop cut in 4 pieces full of fat not healthy at all not fulfilling yet pricey. Beer is expensive."}
{"text":"I don't know how people can be giving this place less than 4 stars! I love this place! I went the night of the first Cav's game and I tell you what...the bartenders were awesome and the food was awesome! This place was beyond crowded during the entire game and I give mad props to everyone that had to work that night! I felt bad for the bartenders who had to constantly repeat to customers \"we are a brewery, we brew our own beer we do not have bud light\".   I ordered the Ocktoberfest all night because it was so delicious! I tried multiple appetizers throughout the night the smoked wings (crazy spicy but good), House Smoked Corn Dogs, Shishito Peppers and the Chorizo Tacos (also a bit spicy but delicious). The only thing I didn't understand about the food I ordered is that the dipping sauces for the corn dogs were served in containers to small to actually dip the corn dog in. Why make them to small for dipping?!  I also love the bathrooms here! This might seem like a strange comment but the Men's bathrooms are straight across from the Women's sharing a common sink. I just love the concept- mainly because you never see this done anywhere."}
{"text":"I am rooting for this place - how can you not when they sell t-shirts with a picture of a pig/hop caricature.  Starting with areas on why this is not getting the full five....would like to see a bit more value on the food for the pricing.  I love that they are supporting local and going for real ingredients in what they make, but still believe its a bit out of balance.  I also would like to see a slightly expanded menu, but I am being perhaps picky on that.  The pluses - amazing decor /atmosphere.  The beer I have tried here has been very tasty.... I can't complain about service ( at least at the bar ) which is where we had dinner.  And I will say, the food that we ate had good flavor"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick beer and an appetizer before heading over to the House of Blues for a concert on a Sunday night.  Let me start off by saying while outside the sun was shining and bright, inside the place was DARK...I felt like I needed a lantern to navigate my way to the bar.  It was extremely hard to see the menu and read the specials.  Our bartender wasn't very friendly.  There is a lot of competition on E. 4th Street for my hard-earned dollar, so make me feel welcome and tell me about the place and all the beers on tap... it was our first time.  For a place that prides itself on all their rotating cast of beers, she really didn't seem enthusiastic about what they had to offer... nothing ruins a night out like bad, inept customer service.  The reason I'm giving this place a third star is for the awesome Corn dog appetizer...3 Corndogs served on a stick with dipping sauces...definitely not your father's corn dogs.  They went down well with the beer.  Ramp up the customer service...if you're not excited about the place, why should I get excited then?"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this place. My fianc√© and I are on vacation from Toledo and exclusively planned on going to this restaurant. If there is a \" seat yourself\" policy at this restaurant there are no signs to idicate as such. We walked in and the only staff to be found were the two bartenders. After about five minutes of standing inside the front door without a greeting or so much as a \"Someone will be with you shortly\" from one of the visible staff members we had enough. I would have been more understanding if they were busy but in this case I think there were about 15 people total in this restaurant. Very unfortunate considering how promising the menu appeared."}
{"text":"We had a lot of different foods. They were all so good! I liked the friendly atmosphere and TVs so we could watch the games! I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Couldn't get in at Lola so I decided to give this place a try. Caution. Don't go there if you are a party of one. I was told by the young lady to sit at the bar which is situated right in front of her. An idiot could tell that there is no seats open at the bar. Then she told me to sit at a \"counter\" that is right along the front window. The restaurant was half full at the time and remined that way during my whole time there! If the waitress had not greeted me promptly, I would have left. I was starving after not having time for lunch.  So I stayed. Had the shoulder steak and brussel sprouts. Steak was decent but the brussel sprouts were good. Waitress was friendly but was not attentive enough. Not worth the money spent!"}
{"text":"If you like smokey flavors, this place is for you. They have a wood fired oven that most dishes are cooked in and it imparts some strong smoke flavors in the dishes, for better or worse depending on your preference. The beers I've had have been great, they had an albino stout that is one of my favorite local beers."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner and had a couple of drinks. The beer is really good, but the food is OK and extremely overpriced. The ribs are $15 and they give you 4 ribs which were tiny and mostly composed of fat.   We also ordered fries and they were soggy and tasted like the kind you buy at the grocery store. The only reason this gets 3 stars is because of the beer. I had the Hop Stomp Kaboom IPA which was fantastic!  If you come I suggest just drinking the beer and going elsewhere for a decent meal."}
{"text":"The beer here is awesome! Try the nitro stout. Easily the best I've ever had.  Didn't try the food but it looked good."}
{"text":"Wonderful location. We sat outside on a fantastic patio and had a delicious dinner. Plate portions are smaller but surprisingly filling. Staff are really great and food service is relatively quick.  The inside restaurant is really noisy...that's probably the only knock I have but if you're here in the summer, take the opportunity to sit on their patio."}
{"text":"Fun night with family and friends...just shared appetizers and a few beers.  Smaller, craft beer selections (really enjoyed the Kolsch called the \"Retreater\").  As I mentioned, we only sampled appetizers...soft pretzel, house-smoked corn dogs and chorizo tacos.  The pretzel was warm and soft, served with a whole-grain mustard as well as a killer pimento cheese sauce (which I seriously could have drank, given the opportunity!).  The hot dogs (within the corn dog batter) were served in a natural casing and came paired with a perfect whole-grain mustard aioli.  Finally, the chorizo in the tacos was only mildly spicy and complimented well by pickled red onion and jalapenos and topped with creamy goat cheese.  We had a spot sitting / standing right in the front plate-glass window which made for great people watching along East 4th Street.  Anxious to give other main dishes a try some other time."}
{"text":"Expensive and service with attitude.  Just didn't work for me. I wanted a good beer and some descent food choices. The menu is pretty pricey and very suitable to they Ritz Carlton crowd. Yet the severs wear blue jeans and hang with each other. Very confusing place. Don't think this place will be in business for very long."}
{"text":"My pals and I ate across the street but stopped for a drink because the place looked amazing. We're from LA and didn't expect much... Kristy was awesome/totally hot my guy friends are drooling and they're handsome too and she rocks at making Kamikaze shots. Seriously, the drinks are great, the atmosphere is fun and the bathroom/ brewery was quite interesting.  Worth the price."}
{"text":"Good food. Great beer. The best service. Had a great time for a first time visitor. Each dish was better than the next. The patatas bravas were my favorite. Our server Alyssa crushed it."}
{"text":"LOVED! Ambiance is very cool and lively. Our server was fabulous. She was so nice and everything came out perfectly. Food is amazing! We ordered so many things on the menu to all share and everyone loved it all. We got the pretzel, sliders, scallops (AMAZING), tacos, mac n cheese and charred brocolini. Do what we did and get it all to share, so many good bites and the portions were just right.  Would absolutely recommend for good drinks, food and a fun, laid back time."}
{"text":"We had an incredible meal. Everything was wonderful; the flavors, portion sizes, drinks and environment. The service is impeccable and everyone is so friendly. We can't wait to eat here again."}
{"text":"I enjoy eating here almost every time I'm in town.  The menu is nice. Good beer and cocktails, although it's tough to get a simple drink if that's what you want.  Service is ok. Sometimes it's great, other times it's not.  Sometimes the bartenders are attentive, other times it's like they forgot there's a bar full of people in front of them and Trey avoid eye contact like the plague.  The food is good. Highly recommend the broccoli. The wings are fab. The flatbreads are ok. Dessert is odd- there's no menu, and the staff do t seem to know enough about them. I ordered one to go, and when I got it home there were peanuts on it. The bartender never mentioned nuts on it- not exactly smart for a good service person.  Some people have allergies, and hell, some may just not like peanuts. Either way, that's a big ingredient to leave out of a description."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch while working an Indians game. Absolutely best service and food. Told the waitress we were in a rush, she gave great suggestions and quick service. The cheddar sausage was fantastic with some of the best whipped potatoes and jus I've ever had. Would love to come back with more people and time to explore the whole menu!"}
{"text":"Good food. Good service.  Good vibe.  But WAY too f'in loud in there for me.  I don't enjoy shouting across the table for conversation."}
{"text":"When we first got there the hostess was very friendly and the bartender came out to offer us drink menus while we waited. The atmosphere was very pleasing but from there it took a bit of a turn. It took almost 10 minutes before someone came over to our table. We eventually we got some water and a round of drinks. Our waiter was not the most attentive and drink were coming out very slowly that we started ordering them preemptively expecting slow service. The Albino Stout was delicious once it eventually came out but drinks were very slow getting to us.   I had ordered the Bread plate, brussel sprouts and burger. While the brussel spouts and spread were decent I was unimpressed with the burger.  While  I understand the small plates concept I thought that for the portion size it was a little pricey.  The brewery had some great beer and think that this establishment has great atmosphere. I plan to return soon in hopes of better service."}
{"text":"In town for R&R Hall of Fame--wanted good beer, nice, casual atmosphere and decent food. This place was great, good mix of veggie and non veggie tapas, amazing selection of craft beers and super friendly service (thanks Alyssa!). I recommend this place and would come again for the beer, food, atmosphere and great service."}
{"text":"Well we were very stoked to come check this out. The menu changes all the time. Today was the 40 day dry aged sirloin. We ordered it medium rare. Sadly it came out medium. Pretty disappointed being this is a place with a butcher on property and it was their cut of the day. Our waitress was awesome and apologized many times. We also never got our lamb ribs. But on a good note, all the other food we ordered was fantastic. Calamari, cauliflower, steak tartare, shrimp and grits, smoked cheddar sausage,  corn dogs, and the bone marrow. All delicious. We do recommend it. Come get u some!!"}
{"text":"The only redeeming quality this place has is the decor. We had to put in our name to get a table 3 times. WTF 3 times! How do you lose our name 3 times!?!?! Did you just throw it away hoping we would disappear. Once we finally got seated after 2 hours we were highly displeased. It's true when everyone says it's loud. Like can't hear the person next to you loud.  They have a beer that is their version of Christmas Ale... it blows. Not nearly as good.  Had several aps. Corn-dogs were decent in a nice batter. Had the tomato flat bread. The tomatoes were supposed to be heirlooms but were flavorless. The calamari if you threw it at the wall it would bounce back and take your eye out. Loaded Kennebec fries were good but the portions are tiny. The server said we could get smalls plates to share. Only big enough to share between 2 people. We ordered the cauliflower as an ap... more on that later.  Main I had the Jasper Chicken. It was worth the price and had a huge portions of moist white meat chicken. My guy had steak tartar it was tiny portion but really delicious.   Also had their Midwest mule cocktail where in place of lime like in a Moscow Mule they use orange. It was very tasty. We finish dinner and our waiting for our bill when out comes the cauliflower we ordered for an appetizer. We told them we no longer wanted it. The server refused to take it back... d**k. So I figure might as well eat it. I take a floret to eat and had to spit it out. It was sooooo salty. I told the server I was unhappy with it and he got all shitty with me. He said, \"oh so now it doesn't taste good. Funny. Sure.\" I was flaming. He disappears while I search for a manager to tell him his server screwed up, wouldn't take ownership, then basically called me a liar. We already dropped $80 bucks on dinner, With a group of 8 that's going to be around $600 our party bring to your establishment and you want to be rude with me. Server finally came back and reluctantly took back the cauliflower and removed it from our bill.   All in all the aps are not worth the price, the servers not worth dealing with the attitude... that is if you can get seated. People ranted and raved about this place but I was highly disappointment."}
{"text":"I love this place. Excellent beer and food. The menu is unique compared to the standard brewery. It's well worth a visit. My only complaint is that there isn't one in my town."}
{"text":"I ordered the lobster roll on a recent Tuesday night.  While what I got was good, lobster roll is a bit of misnomer as it was a half slice of toast with four bites of lobster on it.  Literally, my meal was four bites and it didn't come with anything else.  Expensive for what it was.  I won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"I think that something I have to keep in mind when writing this review is that, due to my intense appreciation for the yelp community, I was already aware from previous reviews that I might feel overcharged for the portions at Butcher & The Brewer.  While I might say this place gets 5 stars for their bar alone (reasonably priced, great beer), the fact that the rest of the experience (and the food) isn't as accessible (re: high prices, small portions) makes it hard to award the elusive 5 stars, top-of-the-line review. In fact, the ordering experience and food prices left me thinking 3 stars, so an average of 4 sounds about right.   Here are my thoughts:  Overall, I enjoyed my experience which consisted of beer and a charcuterie board at the bar. It was a bit loud, but the other patrons were friendly, and there was a wide selection of [silent] TV channels on the big screens above the bar.   I really enjoyed their beer selection. While the bartender seemed uninterested in telling me about the beers (bummer), she was nice enough about letting me taste a few in order to make a decision. I tried the Hasselhefe, Framboyzee, and Spice Spice Baby (their holiday/christmas/winter beer). The Hasselhefe was mild, and a little bit sweet- I could see it being very popular on a hot day. I was not thrilled with the framboyzee- it was fruity, but lacked the tart and funky the description promised. The Spice Spice Baby was by far the best- spicier and smoother than the Christmas Ale from Great Lakes, for sure. I also tried their Gourdy (the Pumpkin beer equivalent) and was unimpressed- the spice was there, but it was lacking all things pumpkin.  As far as the Charcuterie board goes- get it. Just get it. For one person, it can basically be a meal. Not only do you get the cheese/meat, but mine came with some great mustard, honey, and pear compote that complimented the different meats and cheese and amazing toasts and buttermilk crackers. Strongly recommend the chicken liver mouse. The only downside was the bartender's informing me that the menu online isn't accurate; it appears the online menu includes all of the possible options, only about 1/3-1/2 of which were available or on that day's menu. While I missed the buratta, the board I got was still pretty good."}
{"text":"Finally got to come back to the Butcher & The Brewer. Our experience was much better, even though it was packed for Cavs game 6 of the finals. The two of us only waited 20 minutes to sit down, which was awesome. Our waiter was great, made nice beer suggestions, I didn't like one but he took it away and replaced it without giving me a hard time.  We split the mussels (amazing again), broccoli raab, and fried chicken. The fried chicken is soooo good! We were very full off those three items, and our waiter did not pressure us to order more. I will be back just for that fried chicken and the Stop Hop Kaboom."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious and our waitress was extremely attentive and amazingly nice. The pierogi flatbread and pretzels &a cheese were delicious, as was our cheese board. I definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Put in name for a table of 3 at 6:00 was told 30-40 minutes for wait time. Checked back at 7 and they told us it would be another hour at least and were extremely rude hosts that I heard using profanity about other guest... Extremely unprofessional... We walked out don't know if we'll ever give it another shot"}
{"text":"My friends and I stopped in here before going to a concert! We were mainly looking to have some beers and a couple appetizers because we were still full from our lunch earlier in the day. Our waiter, Mark, was wonderful and so knowledgeable about the beer list! He helped me and all of my friends find something that we would like based off of our likes. I had the Saaz Collaboration, which was a Belgian Blonde. I typically drink beers like this and really enjoyed it. For appetizers, we ordered the pretzel sticks and flatbread. Very delicious! We all wished that we weren't so full to have an actual meal there because the menu looked really great! Overall, we were really happy with our experience there and enjoyed our waiter!"}
{"text":"The name says it all, fine cut meats and excellent craft beer. Went to Cleveland for the week, and made myself go to all different top restaurants but this is the only place I went to 3 times (between dinner and lunch). The lobster roll is awesome! If I ever come back to Cleveland, will make sure to stop again!"}
{"text":"What a great experience!  My server, Jane, was a lovely introduction to Cleveland culture. Great advice, friendly smile, and attentive service to our whole table.   I felt like we traveled around their kitchen with our selections and it was ALL tasty.   Later, I found out pierogi pizza is a thing, I think it'll be hard to beat the one at Butcher and the Brewer.   If you have someone to share this rich dish with: try the diver scallops. Now I have a reason to experiment at home again.   The whole area is rife with tasty looking menus. But don't miss a stop here."}
{"text":"The food here is awesome.  In between gastro pub and bistro food with fun atmosphere on the cities best street."}
{"text":"Came here after a concert downtown and was happy to see there was lots of seating and a nice patio area with plenty of room, service was surprisingly quick even after the droves of people started coming in from the game and shows. The cheese tray selection was great and I love assorted chessboards theirs did not disappoint very tasty the flatbread pizza was also yum. I'm not into beer but they have a great selection I had the mango Margarita and it was great. Will be checking this place out again."}
{"text":"Small portions, glaring nasty lighting and a loud, annoying noise level make one wonder what the hipsters think is cool."}
{"text":"Great pretzel with pimento cheese dip.  Excellent strip steak with some Korean chili marinade.  Also the shishito peppers were solid."}
{"text":"Yelp really needs half stars as this place is probably 3.5 right now.   Huge space with a big bar and semi open kitchen. Wife and I found a seat at the bar; she ordered some kind of beer cocktail that was so so and I had the IPA, which was good,  but nowhere near its local competition in that category. I wanted to try a few more beers but I was driving.  Had the seared octopus on an arugula salad with chickpeas. It was pretty good, especially the salad. Initially ordered the short ribs... they were sold out. How do you run out if something five minutes after you open on your first day? Meh, whatever  Service was a little slow, but they just opened.   A place with good potential, but I must say I hate the location and that may get in the way of visiting often, or even infrequently."}
{"text":"Food and beer was outstanding, service was terrible. I had the Blackstar IPA and the sliders, both are excellent. I had to flag down servers and hostesses just to get silverware, my initial order, and the check. Left me frustrated with the process."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!  Food is very good, many of the beers are outstanding and the setting is so cool!  Plus, it has the most amazing bathroom in Cleveland!  Look at all the boxes you can check off: Fresh brewed awesome beer - Check Great Ambiance - Check Great Service - Check Great Food - Check Sports on TV's - Check Bathroom that you can't wait to take your pants off in - Check  In particular, we loved the White Stout.  Maybe the best beer I've had at any brewery ever.  We tried every one of their beers.  Had an amazing nap afterwards.  Can't wait to go back!  This is on my \"Never walk by without stopping in\" list.  Put it on yours as well!"}
{"text":"Here for dinner with friends. Plates are small and meant to be shared. I wasn't that impressed with meat platter but lamb ribs and steak tartare was out of this world!  Every else enjoyed their food but agreed the portions were small."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and look forward to going back. The space is amazing. Beautifully done. The food is also amazing. I like smaller portions because you can order and try a few things without getting overloaded. The shank and fries were my favorites. The beer is unique and well thought out. I look forward to seeing what they come up with next. It's a different concept than most of the places on the street. But I think we should all welcome the change. Do yourself a favor and try them out."}
{"text":"The beer is awesome. Incredible. I will be getting growlers from this place, and taking it with me frequently.  The food is decent. Some of it is great. The price point is a little high for what you get. I wasn't blown away by anything, but I enjoyed the pork rinds, the chorizo tacos, and the pork entree. However, I was incredibly disappointed with \"build-a-board\". We choose a collection of cheeses and meats. Everything tasted alright, but the portions were so tiny. It was so hard to share and enjoy it with everyone.  I'm not a big fan of the atmosphere. It is just too loud. It is so hard to have a conversation with anyone here. The acoustics of the place, and the lack of decoration are probably the most likely culprits. It just makes it a poor place for dining with more than one person.  I would be lying if I didn't admit that I had hoped that this place was just a downtown location of the Tremont Taphouse, with all the delicious house brewed beer."}
{"text":"Beer = run of the mill. FFF put these guys to shame. Service = so far (sitting at bar) seems deliberately disconnected or pretentious.  Guy tender walked by three times before another said \" do you want to order some food\".  He must have something on his mind.  Had multiple oysters with three returns due to no meat or equivalent. Tender made it right but there was still one after second serving that was bad.Disappointing that the shucker wasn't paying attention.All in  probably will not return, to many alternatives in the area and for the 120$ spent i prefer not to have attitudes."}
{"text":"So it was my first time at Butcher and the Brewer.  Let's take this one step at a time: 1.  Decor:  I like the way the place was set up.  Nice wooden tables and I appreciated the old school lighting. 4/5 stars 2.  Notice:  it was so loud, we could not hear our server as she went through the specials... And it's not because I'm old.  we went at 7pm and it only for louder as the night went on... Annoying so.  They also played music over their speaker system... Why?  It was already freakin loud.  1/5 stars 3.  Food:  I'm not a pork fan so I won't comment on that.  Otherwise we tried a lot of food.  Mainly because the portions are small, and with 5 people, you'll probably end up ordering 10 to 15 dishes.  Most of the dishes were great!  I would not waste money on the cheese and charcuterie tray. 4/5 stars 4.  Price:  I believe the price is slightly high for a place where multiple dishes need to be ordered.  3 of us spent 264 dollars including a few cocktails.  3/5 stars $$$  Overall I would go back but I'd limit the number of dishes to what Iiked best: sliders (minus the salty bun), Joseph's chicken, and corn dogs.   Did not like pork shoulder or lobster roll... Yuck."}
{"text":"I went to dinner for a friend's 30th birthday party.  There were 8 of us.  It was SO loud.  I could only hear the people directly beside me and across from me so it wasn't a good birthday dinner atmosphere.  I ordered a couple of appetizers -- the bone marrow and the bacon wrapped dates.  My husband enjoyed the bone marrow and the bacon wrapped dates were pretty tasty but you only got three.  I had the mac & cheese and brussel sprouts as my entr√©e. This is where the problems really began.  I think most of us ordered two things and they came out so sporadically over 15-20 minutes.  My brussel sprouts were almost gone by the time I finally received my mac & cheese.  Nobody felt they could start eating, of course, until everyone had been served...and to make matters worse, the birthday girl was one of the last to be served.  Now here's the kicker...  Our bill came and it was $97.  I reviewed it and didn't notice anything wrong and put my credit card inside.  When I received my card back with receipt I noticed the amount was now $104.  The difference was they added on my second beer which had been left off the first bill.  I completely admit owing for that but if the amount changed and they realized their error they should have come back and communicated that to me before charging.  It just came across as a little shady...  I highly doubt we'll ever return, especially with that kind of price tag on a mediocre meal."}
{"text":"I actually love the vibe this place has!  Industrial, rustic, very nice.  This place is still hanging on to two stars because of their beer.  It's fabulous.  We came in a group and so I was able to try multiple beers- The Spice Spice Baby is excellent!   If you come, sit at the bar, have a beer, skip the food.  Plates here are expensive, and I'm willing to pay for good food if it holds up to the level of quality it boasts.  This place doesn't  Our waiter was very good- suggested some of his favorite dishes, informed us that plates are served community style and should be eaten as they come out of the kitchen.  I can see how you could maybe share these dishes with a single date, but otherwise, these are not sharing dishes.  Enough for 3-4 bites per person if you order your own.  Not good for sharing!  So our group was left watching each other hungrily eat and share as much as we could after having waited 40 minutes for a table.  We needed to order much more than we did (2 plates per person) to leave satisfied.  We followed up our dinner with happy hour elsewhere since our 2 plates per person left each couple paying well over $65 dollars for what felt like a beer and half an appetizer.  We may stop in here again for a beer- the only reason this review is holding onto 2 stars- but when you're surrounded by REALLY great food, there's no way this place can hold onto customers at this cost for this quality and quantity."}
{"text":"Another great spot on East 4th! Finally had a chance to check this place out prior to a Cavs game. We arrived around 5:30 and it was already packed- wait was around 45 min for a 2 top, and the bar was quite full... but we found a single seat on the corner & hubs was willing to stand. This is my only drawback- is the odd location of this seat- by the bar door, with a computer behind me and I think there could have been room for another stool on the corner. Oh well- we could've waited for a better seat so it's our issue (& probably a bigger annoyance for the staff to have us there, although I never heard anything!).  Anyway, we don't really care for ipas or hoppy beers (I know blasphemy for a millennial), so we ordered a flight of the 3 lightest beers- the Jake, reached, an amber ale (don't remember name), and the albino stout. They were all good, but the albino stout was so unique & we both loved it. I would love to try their Christmas ale, but they were tapping their last barrel of it the next day, so we'll likely have to wait til next year. We also ordered the bone marrow, dates, and chorizo tacos. All were really great & portioned for sharing. Bone marrow is so good & the presentation was fantastic- we need a few extra pieces of toast and the bar staff generously obliged. The dates were packed with flavor. I loved the goat cheese on the taco, but this was probably my least favorite dish of the three, although still good.  The bar staff was super attentive & helpful despite the busy bar. They timed every dish out perfectly so that as one empty dish left our table, our next dish arrived within minutes. Overall a a great spot for drinks & food!!"}
{"text":"This is the best meal I have ever had! Our waitress Allyssa hooked it up....all the beers and food she recommended was off the chain! GO CAVS AND ALYSSA!"}
{"text":"Great place with an outdoor patio and very large inside with TVs. The service was very good, beer was awesome from their own brewery, the albino stout was best ever stout I have had. Chorizo bacon dates, burger sliders and the flat bread pizza with bacon and a fried egg on top were excellent! A must place to check out."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, and tons of seating. It has a casual feel but with a fine dining flair. The staff is phenomenal. The menu had tons of mouthwatering options, and I was very pleased with my meal! Will return next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Very busy on game nights, in fact standing room only on two of our visits. On the third, we sat at one of the communal tables and made new friends. The place is loud, but food and drink are very good. Yes the smoked marrow is definitely a winner, and worth the asking price. The Calamari is clean and crisp, with a great lemon aioli.  I also liked the Maple-glazed pork shank and tempura cauliflower. Not a fan of the Lobster \"Roll\"."}
{"text":"This place has great food and awesome selection of beer. I was also surprised by the prices being reasonable. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Grabbed dinner here on a Thursday night before a show at Playhouse Square. Our server selected our beers for our flight based on other beers I liked and she suggested her favorite picks. The pork shank is TO DIE FOR. You must order this - such a unique cut of meet but it's delicious, especially with homemade buttermilk dressing and kimchi. The calamari was great and so were the bacon wrapped dates. The pierogi flatbread was creative but not my favorite. I'd certainly return for more porkshank and to try some other dishes."}
{"text":"Doesn't take reservations (despite what yelp says). Sometimes you have to wait 1.5 hours or more for a table. Not worth it.   I'd go back to this place, but only with a reservation to avoid the madness of trying to get a table at dinner time on the weekend."}
{"text":"Look, I don't expect much when I go out. I enjoy craft beers and semi-attentive service. You don't need to sit there and chat me up about my life, especially on a busy Saturday night, but to blatantly ignore me and eat pretzels instead is absolutely atrocious.  Sammi and I were able to grab some seats at the bar after a few minutes, which I was really excited about considering how packed it was. Their beer selection is very impressive - I went with the \"Welcome to the Stage\" Amber, which had a very distinctive taste to it. It was a very different amber than what I'm used to, and it's not a beer I would drink while eating. It was tasty for what it was but I probably couldn't have more than a few.   My favorite thing about bars is meeting new people and chatting with up. The two men next to us mentioned that they had ordered pretzels three times and they still hadn't received them. They were very calm for having that experience, especially after we had put 2+2 together. What I mean by that is when I first tried to get a bartender's attention, instead of acknowledging me, he took a bite of a fresh pretzel order. An order that was obviously meant to go to the two gentlemen next to me but neglected to deliver. I eventually got another bartender's attention, and that same bartender finally got their pretzels, but to be ignored like that and his apathetic mood really dampened my experience.  I hope to try Butcher & the Brewer again, and definitely try their food. I've heard nothing but high compliments on their food menu, but if I receive the same type of service again, I won't continue patronizing this establishment."}
{"text":"The space is designed as a traditional Public House so the area is wide open so it can get noisy and with long tables which encourage mingling with those sitting around you.  That's usually not our style so we'd been waiting for a time when the restaurant wasn't too busy (like not after work, before and after sporting events and basically all Saturday nights). So we were finally able to try Butcher and The Brewer on an later afternoon on a Saturday. And even then it was more than half-filled. We didn't try the beers as I went with the House Old Fashioned which was quite strong (that's a good thing) and Jeannene enjoyed the Corpse Revivor so I can't comment on the Brewer part of the restaurant title but I can vouch for the Butcher angle. We started off with a board of blue cheese, foie gras and some dried pork sausage. The blue cheese included some amazing honey while the foie, already almost as light as whipped cream, came with some sweet grape preserves. We might get this for dessert the next time. All the items on the menu are meant for sharing, some are standard appetizer size while others are about the size of one entree. We went with several of the \"Bar Snacks\" --  crispy calamari ($12), house-smoked corndogs ($10) and aged beef sliders ($15). Also, the food comes out as it is completed in the kitchen, For us, that meant the calamari first. The squid was cooked perfectly and the batter was very light but I thought the lemon aioli was more of a thick mayo (and a lot of it) and I didn't get much taste of lemon or the black chili oil that was also on the plate. I'm glad we didn't get the lobster roll because this was enough seafood/mayo combo for me. Next came the corn dogs (3 of them) and they were delicious -- the batter was quite light and had a kick of jalapeno while the house-smoked hot dog lived up to the restaurant's Butcher name. It came with a mustard and a ketchup, and, like the dipping sauces we had witht he meat and cheese board, they were both delectable and added to the overall plate instead of just being an obligatory add-on. The meal kept getting better with the sliders (also 3 of them). The meat was juicy and the bun was nice and crispy and the pimento cheese and spicy mayo added just a little tang instead of overwhelming. These rank right up there with the burgers at The Greenhouse and Bar Cento., and of course, The B Spot. We were too full for dessert but the menu looked as encouraging as the one for main courses."}
{"text":"What a great place. The atmosphere is very comfortable yet looks rustic. Love the menu - wonderful options from starters, veggies and several protein selections. The service was spot on - our server was Isaac and he was familiar with everything we asked about. He offered some beer selections, mixed drinks and even helped us with a veggie. The broccolini was excellent - thank you Isaac."}
{"text":"I went here two nights in a row, and simply loved it.  I sat at the bar both times, and the bartenders were really helpful in recommendations and picking out beers. I did the steak tartare both nights (that excellent!), the bone marrow, and the scallops. Nothing but praise for all three.  I tried maybe a half dozen beers as well.  My favorite as the Albino Stout.  Everyone was incredibly friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"Butcher & The Brewer will be a stand out in downtown Cleveland for a long time to come. The beer was great with all the in house selections, which you can see the brewing equipment on display both upstairs and downstairs and the menu didn't disappoint. The stone fruit salad was fresh and seasonal, the \"bacon & eggs\" was perfectly executed and the corn dogs were fun and fantastic. They will continue to find their legs as they get past the opening weeks and I look forward to time on the patio when it opens!"}
{"text":"Small plates is the menu theme at this popular bar/brewery on E4. Stop in before a cavs game or for a weekend out. Great place to watch the cavs! Get there early as seating fills up quickly on game day!"}
{"text":"It was okay, very loud inside which I guess is a sign of vitality. I had the pepper tofu and it was delicious, but not super filling on its own (and for the price, one has hopes). My friend got the potato something and that was tastey. I also heard good reviews of the corn dogs and the sliders came in a substantial portion"}
{"text":"It was nothing that impressed me out of all the great restaurants in Cleveland. Plus the service was pretty bad. The bar staff stood around bitching about other staff and took forever to get drinks (was not busy at all) anyway... Got the roasted bone marrow! Was so pumped about it. Some was good I guess. Very gelatinous.."}
{"text":"I found their beer to be very mediocre. The ones I sampled I had were all kinda thin - no really body or solid mouth feel. Seemed like amateurish brewing. The GLBC beer I had after those tasted 100% better.  Food was very good but a bit pricey for what you get. Tried the tofu, pierogi flatbread, fries, and cheese plate. The tofu was the stand out but barely what I'd consider to be adequate enough to be consider a main portion.  The  design is cool but extremely noisy. Even if it wasn't packed, I imagine it would still be quite loud because of the acoustics. The nice thing about going to a gastropub/microbrewery is the chance to socialize, discuss beer and food, and chill but the environment is not conducive to this, so I probably wouldn't go back, esp. considering the prices and beer quality."}
{"text":"I had a fantastic time with my party of six for a girls night out.  The beer was tasty and so were the mixed drinks for the non-beer drinkers.  The space was open and airy while still giving that intimate feel.  Our server was great, being knowledgeable and witty.  I like places that have sharable foods because I get to try at lot more of the menu.  I am a huge fan of their Patatas Bravas and pierogi pizza (I will be back for both).  I also got to sample the Salt-Roasted Beets, the Broccolini, and Mac & Cheese.  All delicious.  I even liked the shared sinks for the bathroom area."}
{"text":"Excellent food and atmosphere. The eggs with pork belly plate was amazing. Nice thick and full of flavor. I highly recommend it! Make sure to call ahead cause place does get very busy but certainly worth the wait."}
{"text":"I have visited Butcher and the Brewer twice. The first visit went so bad that I reached out to the manager Nikki and after she tried to make things right with us I promised not to Yelp review that visit. So I'm reviewing my second try at Butcher and Brewer. I would give 2.5 stars if i could. We went on the day of an Indians home game (though it ended up being a rainout), there were four of us. We were sat immediately but it did take our server well over 5-10 min to greet our table. The restaurant I would call steady with people but not slammed, I attribute that to the rain outside. When she did make her way over to us we let her know that our two friends have never been there before and they would like to order a flight of beer / sampler to try many of their beers, she quickly responded that they aren't serving beer flights today. Not further explanation, no alternative. So we all four ordered 4 different pints that we weren't certain how they tasted or whether we would be a fan of that particular beer. We were basically going in blind. We also ordered a charcuterie board. When our beers arrived we all fell in love with the Albino Stout. It is truly a spectacular beer. I highly suggest it. Our charcuterie board was phenomenal. We also ordered Bacon-Wrapped Dates and House-Smoked Corndogs as appetizers. The Bacon-Wrapped Dates were delicious. They are only three in a order but we ordered an additional one thanks to the suggestion of our server. If you go definitely try them. I often had to almost beg for refills of water, but so far we were so pleased with our food and the Albino Stout. I visited the restroom and just so you know the restroom is a semi open area with stalls that have doors to your left and your right and a basin in the middle. To your right are the men's stalls and to the left are the woman's. Totally coed. As I made my way back to our table I passed by multiple tables with flights of beer. Imagine my surprise because my server curtly told me they were absolutely not serving flights of beer today. Maybe she meant just to our party of four. I took a pic of a beer flight on another table to show what one would look like if your server is willing to let you order one. I'm always amazed by BREWERIES, that is an establishment that brews their own beer, that is unwilling to let you try their beer. They are in the beer business. I think they sometimes forget that. People that come to their brewery come for the beer.  To sum up this extremely long review, and I apologize for that, if you are looking for a great Stout stop in to Butcher and the Brewer, find a spot near the bar and order a pint. Maybe you even want to try an appetizer or a charcuterie board, but lower your expectations for fast or friendly service. I truly find it hard to believe that the management there instills any sense of responsibility to the patron. I work hard for my money and I enjoy spending it where I feel appreciated for patronizing their establishment. That is not this Brewery in my opinion. Good luck to you if you visit."}
{"text":"Nice place, I liked the atmosphere and the beer. Salt Roasted Beets and Lobster Roll were delicious. But... The Smoked Lamb Ribs were made of 80% of fat, as for the Bacon & Eggs bacon was chewy and 95% of fat..."}
{"text":"They offer wine flights of 2-oz pours, which was great, wish more restaurants did that. We ordered the Salt-Roasted Beets, the Black Pepper Tofu, the House-Smoked Corn Dogs, and the Tempura Cauliflower and all were good. Four plates was too much for two people, not sure we would have finished even three."}
{"text":"Amazing. Friendly and knowledgeable staff. Food with strong and unique flavors and great portions. Amazing atmosphere. Speculation drinks. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Visited while in town to attend an NFL game.  Overall the environment was wonderful - seemingly traditional beer hall with plenty of sports enthusiasts.  However, everything else about our visit was completely subpar.  It started with us being told that a table would be an hour wait.  Not a problem given that 4th street has about a hundred bars so we went for a drink next door.  No sooner did we sit down did we get a message saying our table was ready.  It was less than 6 minutes and we had hit ordered a drink.   Once we returned we were seated but service was extremely slow.  They have what they called communal dining which is basically family style.  We ordered the fried chicken, lamb ribs, Mac and cheese and brocolinni.   We asked if that would be enough food (we are 4 large men) and the waitress assured us that would be more than  enough.   We waited about 20 minutes and a waiter brought the brocolinni.  A tiny dish and the 4 of us looked at each wondering if we should wait for the rest of the mean.   10 minutes later we gave up and started eating each of us getting a small spoonful - it was cold by that time and terribly over salted.  Then came the lamb ribs. 1 each and were good enough - mine was extremely fatty and I left half Of it due to the lack of meat.  10 minutes later we received a small bowl of mac and cheese. Again each of us got a spoonful - it was good but not enough.   Finally - another 10 minutes later the chicken arrived.  Over seasoned and dry there were two small pieces for each of us.  We all left thinking that we needed to go somewhere else to get more food.  Overall not a great experience"}
{"text":"Beautiful decor along with beer & wine on tap make this a perfect spot before a CLE Cavs or Indians home game. I love craft brews and the day we visited, there were 12 on tap. There is ample bar seating along with community style table seating. We always sit at the bar because the service is quicker, especially in a busy location like this, the bar and restaurant was packed 2 hours before the CLE Cavs game! Ordered a flight of beers and later had a glass of Riesling wine, all were excellent. Also tried the Pierogi Flatbread which took some time to come out because the kitchen was slammed, it is an open kitchen and you can watch the food being prepared; however, the food was fresh, hot & tasty. The menu is limited, but from what I observed, everything is well-prepared and I heard no complaints from the guests. I would highly recommend the Butcher & The Brewer, but be aware that upon opening at 4 PM, the seats fill quickly. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Came here for appetizers and drinks and was more than satisfied.  Appetizers and tapas style can be split easily between 4 people for a full meal.  Staff is also great."}
{"text":"Stopped on a Saturday afternoon for drinks- I had a beer flight - very good and affordable - 4 5 oz beers for $10; my lovely wife had Cabernet and it was good - smacked on curry cauliflower - was truly delicious - server was awesome   Will come again   Sit at window and enjoy the atmosphere in the craft brewery"}
{"text":"We walked into Butcher and Brewer after reading all of the amazing yelp reviews and we are sure glad we did!! Not only was the food well priced it was also excellent (we had tofu, broccolini, and the kale salad). And to top it all off we also had phenomenal service! Louise (who I believe is the manager?) went above and beyond to make sure we enjoyed our food and drinks - I have worked in the restaurant industry before - and she truly impressed us! I highly recommend this place - you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Food staff and atmosphere were amazing. Staff was knowledgeable about the food and the beer. Jim was amazing and recommended the best bone marrow and tacos we have had. If I could I would give it 10 stars!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have been waiting to get into this restaurant for along time. We looked forward to it even more since the reviews on Michael Simons show. We arrived at 915 on a Tuesday night, the location had a few tables full and a few bar patrons.   The staff was fast, friendly and courteous. And we were seated in a booth which we asked for instead of a table. The menu was described and this concept of community food sharing. This is even better with expectations of portion size for the prices they charge.   Sadly we got shrimp and grits and sliders and a flatbread all over 10 dollars. When they came out our mouth dropped and we both said to each other, where is the rest of our food. Portions siZe was small, very small for price. Three small sliders for 15 bucks, a tiny flat bread for around 12 that had four pieces that were not even three bites. The shrimp and grits were quality but again small for the price. Our bill was high stomachs still hungry. The food was high quality but to small for the price by almost double what should have Been charged for expectations.   Overall high quality food, good service just not worth the outlandish prices."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review as I sit at the restaurant. I've been sitting here for about an hour and have yet to even order any food and our server was not at all interested in even helping us or checking in to see if we were ready to order. At this point I don't care about the food, the service thus far is absolutely terrible. Don't even attempt to eat here."}
{"text":"There are several vegetarian and vegan options on the menu, and the ones I tried were excellent.  The spicy tofu was just the right balance of spice and savory. The Cleveland Tofu was perfectly chewy, and soaked up the delicious sauce nicely. The tempura cauliflower was perfectly crisp on the outside, and tender on the inside. The sauce on the side was creamy, but came in a too-small jar that made it hard to access, even with the little spoon provided.    The place is definitely loud, and not for a romantic dinner. But if you're a vegetarian/vegan and want a place to go with your meat-eating friends this is a great choice."}
{"text":"I've put off writing this review for a long time. Mostly because I just couldn't make up my mind. Sure, I love the decor, the atmosphere, the general \"vibe\" of this place. I've enjoyed many a fine brews there as well- the Framboyzee is one of the finest raspberry wheats I've ever tried, and The Jake and the Stop Hop Kaboom are both solid choices. I've sat at the bar and enjoyed apps, I've met friends here for dinner, something must keep me coming back. But when I think back on all my experiences here, I'm just greatly...underwhelmed.  To start, its always crowded, and i mean CROWDED. Good for them, I'm sure. But who wants to fight their way to the bar for drinks at happy hour, then stand because all the bar seats are taken, as are the tables? Not this gal. It creates an awkward experience in my opinion. If you do manage to snag one of the tables around the bar (no chairs, these are standing room only tables), you sometimes get waited on by the servers, and other times you're left to fend for yourself and keep going back to the bar for drinks. Every time I'm here and its that crowded, I just don't know what's going on. Should I open a tab with the bartender? Should I wait for the server to get our drink order? Is this awkwardly placed table in the way of the servers?   The other thing for me is the food. And I get the whole concept thet're going for- small shareable plates, food comes out as its ready, I get it. None of that bothers me, in fact, I think its kind of fun. But they just don't nail it for me. I appreciate their use of local ingredients and house butchery, but the end result doesn't blow me away. Their house smoked corn dogs tasted like I could have bought them at the grocery store. The smoked wings were mediocre at best. I ordered the chicken as an entree once, and my server didn't inform me that its just a chicken, on a plate, and I would need to also order additional sides. What irks me the most about the food is the price. They recommend 2-3 plates per person, but those plates are $12-28 a piece. That turns into a pricey meal. Heck, I can get an awesome 5 course tasting meal a couple doors down for less (I'm lookin' at you, Greenhouse). It just doesn't add up for me, especially when the food is as average as its been in my experiences.   Honestly for me, this is a brewery. Hopefully I get lucky and its not packed to the gills so I can sit at the bar and enjoy a couple Framboyzees. Maybe after a couple drinks I'll grab an app, but I won't be making dinner reservations."}
{"text":"Amazed at the quality of food and service on a Cav's and Indians night. Top notch.  We went all appetizers.  Highly suggest it."}
{"text":"This place was great. Beer was good from light to dark. Mac & cheese, shank, lamb ribs, and malt cake were great. I would highly recommend this place. Service was good."}
{"text":"I feel like this place is way overly hyped up. The server recommended 3-4 plates per person, which gets expensive quick. The food was just mediocre to me too, expect the shrimp grits. Try that."}
{"text":"Beer great. Food great. Ambiance great. Highly recommend. We came late night on a Thursday and it was expectantly busy, pretty loud inside, but the food and the beers made up for any issues with the loudness. Highly recommend especially their beets and their Mac n cheese."}

{"text":"Butcher & The Brewer.  Great find situated on the very popular E. 4th Street.   Only open one year so anyone  that USED to live in CLE doesn't know about this gem.  Great for locals and business travelers    The first thing we noticed was the excellent lighting upon entering the door.   This is a very pleasant find.    The huge bar on the left is inviting and the bar staff most accommodating.    Brewmaster Eric Anderson is on his game with awesome options. We personally loved 'Who's  a Good Boy' a Dry Hopped Kolsch.   You are presented a fun bar food menu and a HUGE array of shucked Oyster options.  5 stars.   Definitely will come back and share his great find with friends, colleagues and family.  Cheers, Bob"}
{"text":"Butcher & The Brewer is like nothing Cleveland has ever seen and is exactly what Cleveland needs. It's a public house on a grand scale with beer, craft cocktails and great eats in an amazing 1930's/40's inspired space.  Our dinner on opening night couldn't have been better from each plate we shared to the service. It is clear that they went to great efforts to have a fully trained staff of some of Cleveland's finest service folks and kitchen crew to be ready for their opening.   Every dish was a winner and was perfectly prepared. We subbed house made ricotta for goat cheese on the beet salad. Perfect beets, perfectly dressed with sublime ricotta. Stone Fruit, Tomato, Burrata, Panzanella salad was smart and delicious. The bone marrow is roasted in a wood burning oven, is roasty/toasty/smokey goodness and is served with perfect toasted bread and a perfect parsley salad. The roasted whole fish is a crisp, clean riff on the Thai Pla Rad Prik, a dish I will return for again and again.   The soon to open butcher shop will offer cuts of various meats, pantry goodies, ice cream and made to order sandwiches. Also soon to launch is an oyster bar which will offer a rotating variety of west and east coast oysters.   If you're a fan of Chicago places like Publican, Girl and the Goat or Purple Pig, you will love Butcher and Brewer as much as I already do. It's a place that captures the same convivial vibe as those Chicago favorites but does so on its own terms- back to that 30's/40's vibe and Cleveland spin.  The investment the owners (the good folks of Tremont Tap House) made in this project and Cleveland is awe inspiring. Their commitment to working with local growers and producers is yet another thing that makes me thrilled about this business. These are the kind of folks you want to support and they've created a space and concept that makes it a joy to support.  Best wishes to them and hurray for Cleveland."}
{"text":"Pierogi pizza was off the hook delicious. The bacon wrapped dates might be the best thing I've ever put in my mouth. Shishitos were scrumptious and so was pork shoulder steak. Favorite beer-Framboyzee. Boyeeeeeee."}
{"text":"The only good thing was the drinks, and even those were over-priced. The service was mediocre, and the food was terrible. We had never been here before and it was not explained that steak tartare is raw meat. I am very disappointed with this establishment."}
{"text":"I'm loving this place more and more every time I go. The first time I came I was a little unsure about the community seating as I didn't want to sit next to randos...but turns out it's really not that bad and if you're lucky, you could get seated next to some pretty awesome people.   The drinks are delish! Love the different cocktails and beer on tap. The service is usually on top of refills and clearing plates which is really nice too.   My favorite dish on their menu (and the menu changes seasonally I guess) is the pierogi flatbread. GET IT! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"only came for the beer on a weekend night. solid beers for sure. place was totally packed. great atmosphere and music. maybe will try the food next time"}
{"text":"Ordered the lobster roll, calamari, dates(never actually showed), bone marrow, mussels, tartar and smoked wings.   Everything but the mussels and wings lacked flavor. Pretty disappointing overall. I love dates and I'm sure that would have been delicious but they didn't end up at the table.   Consensus at the table was that this place was disappointing."}
{"text":"After strolling along the lovely E. 4th street, our group decided on this place to dine at before catching Roger Waters at the Q arena. They offered a very impressive, affordable menu with  many vegetarian options to boot! We got there early enough to grab a table outside.   A cozy communal atmosphere, great service, stellar craft beers and locally sourced entrees made our experience top notch! The people watching was super entertaining, too! The crispy pork shank, tempura cauliflower and mushroom flatbread come highly recommend!!! My only regret is not getting photos of the food because the presentation was stellar! We look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing beer and amazing service. Don't miss out on the wings, sliders and corn dog. Place has a great vibe and was an all around great restaurant"}
{"text":"I really liked the feel and the atmosphere when I walked into this place... All the TVs are in black and white which is cute and the lighting is nice.  We were seated in a booth in the back so it was kind of private for our \"girls night.\" The bathroom is also really interesting; it's down the stairs where the big beer brewing tanks are on display.  There are individual rooms instead of stalls, and the men and women share a trough-like sink... Pretty unique!   Apart from the decor, I really wasn't very impressed with the actual food and drink aspect.  We ordered a few appetizers to share (fries with aoli, corn dogs, and pretzels with pimento cheese dip).  The portions would be fine for 2 people going out to dinner, but for more than that, everyone basically got a bite of each dish.  The corn dogs were what I was really looking forward to and they were bland and soggy... Definitely disappointed.  My mac and cheese entree was creamy with a nice crunch on top from the bread crumbs, but there was something a little bit off on the cheese flavor.  The friends who ordered the burgers really enjoyed them but they were not very nicely played with literally a burger on a plate with no side or even lettuce and tomato.  Very strange.  I tried one of the beers they brew in-house, the framboyzee.  I didn't hate it, but I was envisioning something a little more fruity from the description.  It tasted more like a regular wheat beer than anything else.   Overall, if you are looking for atmosphere, this is the place to go, but if you are looking for tasty food and something worth the prices, maybe choose somewhere else"}
{"text":"Went for a pint before Brewzilla & returned after for dinner & drinks. Really impressed overall. Comfortable space, great service. The beers are what brought us in, & the food will bring us back. The tempura asparagus was awesome. Crispy & light. We also had one of the flat breads, the pretzels, wings... Someone in our party also had the tartar which was quite good. It was very unpretentious. Still several things on the menu I'd like to try. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This restaurant/brewery is in an amazing spot - easy to grab dinner and drinks before an Indians or Cavs game. The beer is unique - especially the albino stout - and the food menu is really creative.  Everything we had tasted great, but my favorite thing about this place was the aesthetics. The inside is huge and really well decorated."}
{"text":"If you want to drink beer, come here.  If you want to eat, do not!!!!  One dish they made had a very pungent smell that turned my stomach.  When served at other tables, it made you feel sick.  My own food was just okay.  I would go there again for a beer, but I would never think of dining again."}
{"text":"Omg! Food orgasm ... A must, culinary experience. We were lucky to arrive before the high traffic time. Good thing cause it was ridiculously crowded when we left. We ordered the patatas bravas, Brussels sprouts, beets and smoked lamb. A beer lovers paradise and not too shabby spirits. I had the Midwest mules. So delicious hands down."}
{"text":"We put our name in and were told 1/2 hr wait. After 2 hours (ok, we're optimists) we went to a restaurant across the way, Greenhouse. Their seating system is whack! We are from Los Angeles. Tried the call ahead seating, no Bueno. After we finished our meal at the other restaurant, we got the text our table was ready."}
{"text":"Decidedly not Cleveland ... Small plates inventive cuisine.. The green beans are to die for .. Chicken is excellent  .. Beets were very good and they have Laphroig.  Communal tables and a great vibe.  You want different .. This is it and it's very good."}
{"text":"Had a fun time last night. Had about 20 people in town for a wedding this weekend and wanted folks to see what is happening in downtown Cleveland.   We had the first two large tables when you enter the restaurant. Service was outstanding.   Started with drinks. They have many beers to choose from. Their bar drinks I understand are excellent.   I did try their pierogi flat bread. Excellent. The lake perch looked excellent also their black pepper tofu looked interesting.   Our group loved the sliders, baked pretzels and other appetizers.   Be sure to go downstairs to the restrooms- worth a visit- bring your camera.   Lots of action on East 4. Fun place to visit."}
{"text":"Butcher & The Brewer was our 2nd stop on our little brewery tour. I think we got there around 5pm. It was pretty busy, but not too crazy.   I love the space and atmosphere. It's very dark inside, lots of bench/communal seating. They have big barrels set up for open standing and a lot of high tables. I didn't notice a host stand, so not sure who to tell about our party of people. We stood around a barrel inside, and tried to snag a table in the bar area as soon as it was available. We were quickly scolded that we can't do that, and must put our name in with the host/hostess. We were told that a waitress would come to our barrel, but that never happened. We got our beer at the bar. The conversation with the staff member seemed a bit long for just a quick heads up about how they seat people. Ten minutes after being scolded, we were finished with our beers and left. We would've stayed longer if we had the opportunity to sit at a table. As we left, there was no one sitting at the table we were sent away from. Clearly we weren't \"stealing\" a table from anyone who had been waiting.   The beer I tried, Stop Hop Kaboom was really good! Everyone else liked their beer as well. I would've loved to try their other beer and food.   The bathroom is kind of odd. I can't decide how I feel about it. ha ha It's an open space with the Ladies' bathroom stalls on the left, and the Mens' on the right. The doors are totally private. Apparently the Men's are private urinals. There is a very long sink with several spouts to wash hands. It's completely open, so the sink/tub/whatever you want to call it, is basically communal. Primping in front of the mirror is definitely not private. The ladies better make sure that their skirt/dress isn't tucked into their underwear and guys better make sure their fly is zipped when they come out!   3 stars is basically for the lack of service."}
{"text":"Had dinner with my wife and toddler here. Our waiter was great, and very accommodating to the circus that is us getting settled with our 2 yr old.  He made some recommendations for us and we ended up ordering the Brussel sprouts, chorizo tacos, bone marrow, and the bacon and eggs.  The bone marrow was good, but probably not worth the price. I would of gone with something else. Everything else we ordered was delicious. I especially liked the goat cheese on the tacos. It made it unique and tasty. They did bring the Brussel sprouts out last, which I thought was an odd order to serve it in.  I also had a flight of beers and decided the Hasselhefe was my favorite."}
{"text":"My husband says \"this is the best food we've ever had.\" The brussel sprouts were the best I've ever had- creamy and made with bacon! The steak tartar and Chorizo tacos were delicious. The lobster roll was good but my least favorite dish. The beers were excellent - the albino (chocolate and coffee flavors) was my fave. I recommend the beer sampler! Reasons I didn't give 5 stars is they told us the wait would be 30 minutes but it ended up being an hour and a half. Also, 2 tacos for $10?? Really? It was expensive for how much food we got but the quality did make up for it. But  You definitely need to order a couple dishes per person"}
{"text":"The lower rating has more to with price than with quality.  It's rare that I spend $40 on a meal and walk away hungry which was the case with B&TB.  I had what were essentially two appetizers--the calamari and the smoked lamb ribs.  The calamari was OK but since they were lost in a sea of veggies, they lost their crispness and so were fairly bland.  The ribs were tasty but the plate consisted of six little riblets (don't let the photos fool you--they're small.  They're lamb, after all) and you get about two bites of meat per rib. The Alt 90 ale was satisfying.  I normally shy away from microbrew beers as they're almost all too hoppy for my taste (I prefer nice solid ales like Bass or Smithwicks) but this one claimed to be a German style and lived up to its name. So for me, this place is one and done."}
{"text":"Love the food here, our favorite place for dinner downtown. Staff is always attentive."}
{"text":"Wow. What are the 5 star reviews for? Unreal the food was ok. The shot gun approach we ordered numerous dishes they come up \"when they come up\" so you wait and wait water taste like mold. The restroom well experience that fun worth the trip by itself for that experience. Have to say with 1000 of restaurants designed this one hmmm don't get it. Still waiting for the 4th entree while waiting won't be back"}
{"text":"We went downtown for the Cavs game and had drinks and dinner here! No reservations so make sure to give yourself plenty of time. Food was awesome and drinks were even better!!"}
{"text":"Any place that features charcuterie and fresh cheeses is a place I'll enjoy. We were smart and arrived earlier in the evening because this place filled up really quickly. We started with a nice board of charcuterie and cheese, shared the Chorizo Tacos, and their steak special. Everything was really great! I was also pleased to see their charcuterie and cheese assortment changes fairly regularly! This obligates me to come back!   One thing that was different about this place is that there were several really long tables in the middle of the restaurant. So you may end up sitting next to complete strangers for your romantic dinner out. We ended up being seating fairly close to a family of 4, so it was a bit annoying having to hear child-nonsense for half our dinner."}
{"text":"Was in town for work and found this place on yelp. The 4 flights for $10 is what sold me on the place, but my expectations were exceeded. I sat at the bar and the service was really great. I got their skirt stake on pesto sauce and their beet appetizer. Both were amazing! I would definitely recommend checking this place out if you're in the area. I walked out drunk, full and happy."}
{"text":"We really liked this place.  In fact, we liked it so much that we came back a second night.  The menu was great - we LOVED the pork shank.  Also enjoyed the smoked corn dogs, beets and bacon-wrapped dates (with chorizo).  We were not so taken with the broccoli.  It's a fairly noisy restaurant because it's busy so if you are looking for a quiet, intimate dinner, do not come here.  There are five television sets so always something to watch.  We had a different server each night and in both cases the service was great.  I highly recommend this place and if I'm ever in Cleveland again, I would definitely return."}
{"text":"This was a very disappointing dining experience and unfortunately I will never dine here again because my trust in this restaurant has been violated.  I travel to Cleveland at least once a month entertaining business clientele.  I have been looking forward to taking a group to this restaurant for quite some time as I always book the venue directly across 4th street and see that's its always busy and seems to be very energetic.  We had a reservation for 6:30 on Saturday the 5th of November and were promptly seated.  After being seated, we ordered drinks and several appetizers.  Several of us order Tito's (vodka) and water while others ordered other drinks.  After 2 drinks, several of noticed something was wrong with our Tito's drinks.  To squash any kind of thoughts about being served a different vodka, I ordered 3 shots of Titos for the three of us that were drinking Titos and waters.  To my disgust, all three of the shots were water.  Not only that, the drinks they had been serving us were water as well.  I immediately called the manager on duty over to the table and had her smell the shot glasses and explained to her that our drinks were being doctored.  The manager then proceeded to the bar.  After several minutes and noticing quite a commotion at the bar, the manager returned to the table.  Because this had now become a topic of conversation, a very disappointing topic at my corporate dinner between my clients, I asked to speak to the manager in private as to not further damage the attitude that had now plagued our table.  The manager was very polite but had no answers or reason for the drinks we were being served.  The excuse was the \"cleaning crew must be stealing and we plan to check the cameras\".  Don't all restaurants lock up their hard liquor after close???  I was absolutely appalled that a restaurant like this felt they could take advantage of a large group of people without them knowing.  The manager did remove all the hard liquor charge at my request...not that it was offered.  For this reason, I will never dine or bring clientele to this location again.  For those of you who read this, drink at your own risk as you might not be getting what you ordered."}
{"text":"The beer is good. The atmosphere is great! When we were drunk we loved the food, now that we are here sober, the pretzels are a little dry. The flights a over priced, but that's compared to what I'm used to in NC."}
{"text":"Loved it! I had the Ros√© cider, some west coast oysters on the half shell, salted beets with whipped goat cheese and pistachios, and steak tartare. It was amazing and right up my alley (pun intended). Loved the theme and what they're about!"}
{"text":"I may be biased, mainly because I LOVE meat and try to go after good options that are rare, but this place was awesome.  I had the steak tartar. Amazing.   If you go here, go off the grid and try something you haven't had before.  You won't regret it.   I sat at the bar and had the beer flight. Yeah baby!"}
{"text":"Several of us met for drinks and dinner on a night when the Cavs were playing.  It was so loud that you couldn't hear the person next to you.  I was shouting to the point my throat was getting sore.  After those going to the game left, the noise was reduced to simply mind numbing.    I had a $12 glass of wine which was recommended by the waitress and turned out to be so-so.  Since they must feel I'm incapable of figuring a tip, they added 20%. This for a waitress who took orders and disappeared.  She didn't check back to see if we needed anything and we had to wait too long for our checks.  If the wait staff knows they're getting a 20% tip, they have no incentive to give good service.    The food was ok.  If you prefer to eat things that aren't calorie laden, this is not the place.  My visit was a one and done."}
{"text":"3 stars for the food.  4 stars for the beer.  3.5 stars overall.  This is a very busy and very fun place on 4th, within walking distance to the sports venues.  The bar is huge and seating is at large community tables.  Plates are small to medium sized, similar to tapas, and are meant to be shared.  This review will be a quickie, straight to the point.  Mac and cheese.  Very good, gooey and cheesey, but very salty.  Potatas Bravas.  The highlight on the menu.  Get them with chorizo.  Your mouth will thank you.  Flatbread.  Sausage and broccolini.  Just ok.  Nothing special.  Crispy pork shank.  Huge.  Tasty and crispy.  Second best menu item behind the potatoes.  Cheddar smoked sausage.  This was the least favorite item we've had.  Too smoky.    The beers are good.  Some are served in small-ish glasses, but quality is high.  So go for the beer, and if you're ok with upscale pub food that's good but not great, TB&TB will be lots of fun"}
{"text":"I rarely give 5 stars because there is always room for improvement. However, this place is pretty close. It was a little loud for this ole gal and somewhat dark but not lacking in comfort and flare. The architecture was just as appealing as the menu. I had the watermelon salad, green beans, and pork steak. I don't even like watermelon and I ate a bunch. The blend of fruit, blue cheese, and vinaigrette were perfect. The pork steak was ok but enjoyable. The waitress was totally amazing and really knew her stuff. Overall it was a fantastic taste bud experience."}
{"text":"The restaurant had me at local farmers and \"Good Meat.\" Omg the aged beef sliders. The butcher's blend of aged ribeye, brisket and chuck just melts in your mouth. I could've had another order and I don't even eat beef all that much. What's a half dozen sliders with a taste like that?! Sure wish I could've tried some more options, like the smoked bone marrow and crispy pork shank. Alas, just passing through for work. I bet all these options would've been great.   Looks like a fun place for after work and on the weekends. If I lived here, I'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Extremely excited to try this place and it did not disappoint. Went for the Bourbon Barrel Stuffed French Toast Stout and it was delish. We sat at the bar and enjoyed the smoked wings, calamari, and the shishito peppers. Yes they are small plates, but that was what we were expecting. I can't wait to return to try everything else."}
{"text":"This bar was very cool. Trendy. We didn't try the food as we were there for an after work happy hour, but I ordered a Moscow mule and it was great. Our drinks came quickly despite it being busy before the Cavs game."}
{"text":"Yum. We had just driven in from VA and were a little bummed to find that the dining room didn't open until 4pm but we were excited to try the sandwiches from the deli side and grab a seat on the patio. Brisket was delicious. A bit too much cheese for me but the burnt ends were so tasty. Hubby had the kielbasa and really liked it. Beer selection was great."}
{"text":"We have been here several times and love it.  Great service and inventive food and drinks.  They brew their own beers and always have a wide range of styles to choose from.  The only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is the noise level....the acoustics make it difficult to hold a conversation.  We highly recommend it overall!"}
{"text":"Cool sports bar atmosphere and really interesting menu.  Ordered the mussels, lamb ribs, and beet salad.  They served the ribs first, then mussels, then beets which was a little odd, but that's okay.  All dishes were really fantastic.  Perfectly cooked."}
{"text":"What a joke this place is! Attempted to dine here on 12/9 before the Cavs game with ) customers that I was entertaining. We arrived at 5:30, placed our food order just before 6:00 and by 6:50 only 2 of us had received our food! I've never heard so many excuses in my life about where the other 4 entrees were (oh they'll be out in 2 mins, oh the kitchen is slammed it'll be right up, oh snap the kitchen lost the ticket)........in the end we left with only 2 people eating, and the manager only comped us on a few drinks! WHAT A JOKE!!!!! DONT GO HERE IF YOU WANT TO EAT!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love the location, atmosphere and food. Been here a few times and it's always enjoyable. I felt compelled to write this review because of the odd service my party received. Even though the menu mentions ordering about 2 items per person to share, apparently for a party of 2, ordering 5 items total to share was too much. For parties that like to \"try a bit of everything\", I suggest coming prepared to handle being questioned about your choices. Although, I don't think the portion sizes are that big if you like having enough to eat and some for leftovers..  Overall great place, but service needs to get it together.."}
{"text":"My friends and I were very excited to dine here for my Bachelorette celebration. We were told days before that they DO NOT take reservations but rather call ahead seating. We were told that we just need to call the day of and it wouldn't be a problem. As the day came and we called ahead, we were told that they did not have anymore spots available.  For a restaurant that does not take reservations, how do you become \"full to capacity\" as we were told. Call ahead seating is simply a wait list. Or its supposed to be. So then the host decided to tell us that if we came in early that we may still be able to get a table. So my friends left early to get there by 5pm. When they arrived, the host then told them \"We will have a table for you by 6 or 630.\" We were very excited and all hung out at the bar and ordered drinks and appetizers while we waited for everyone to arrive and for our table to be ready. As the clocked ticked and multiple tables up and left, just to be re-sat, we patiently continued to wait. As 730 rolled around and still we had not been sat, we decided that was a good time to address the host about it. As we got to the host stand, she told us that they wouldn't be able to accommodate our party and that despite being quoted a time of 6 or 630, after waiting over 2.5 hours, that we wouldn't be sat. We then ask to speak to a manager whom basically kept making up excuses and apologizing but \"couldn't do anything about it.\"  We, at that point, were so irritated and offended that after wasting and waiting 2.5 hours on a non existent table that was quoted to us 1-1.5 hours after we arrived, without even being told but yet just completely taken advantage of, WE WERE LEAVING. A restaurant across the way was more accommodating and actually apologetic for your completely thoughtless and rude customer service and we had a fantastic time and dinner there! Not to mention, an almost $1000 tab. We will not be returning to this restaurant and will not recommend it to our friends. Such a poorly handled situation with false information. So \"walk in welcome\" you advertise..... NOT SO MUCH."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was cool, I liked the brewing tanks in the basement. Very open layout. I stopped here with a group of friends after a show at playhouse square.  I ordered a mushroom flatbread. It was okay but lack savory flavor, i would try something else next time. I also tried my friends flatbreads and was not impressed with them either. One friend ordered the Josper Chicken and it was excellent on the bite I had. I also had a bourbon lemon cocktail that was just awesome. Over all I will give it another try! Not every place can do flatbreads."}
{"text":"We were just here for beer and an appetizer, but I will happily return for a full meal.  There are a variety of beers, and we sampled two of them that are brewed in house.  The Stop Hop Kaboom was fantastic.  Also, the calamari appetizer was creative, well prepared, and a delightful appetizer.  The friendly staff was very happy to discuss the beer and brewing process."}
{"text":"We booked a table for 15 people and got a confirmation call from Butchers and Brewers management. Despite that, we were not seated because the table was already taken, the manager didn't accommodate us instead she was rude and we ended up leaving to never come back!Not to mention that the food is inedible."}
{"text":"I went here because I saw several people raving about it but it failed to deliver for me.   The noise level when it is busy is absurdly loud. You can not talk to the service staff and it is difficult to hold a conversation with somebody next to you.  The lighting is unacceptably poor. I felt like an old man nearly having to rub my eyeballs against the menu just to read it. I know that the trend is to have extremely dim lighting but they have taken it to an extreme here.  The food and drink options were above average but there are other comparable options in Cleveland without the need to pay or pray for parking on E 4th and where you can see and hear the people with which you are dining."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner this past Friday while in town for a concert.  Considering Cleveland was hosting two HUGE concerts on back to back nights, we were pleasantly surprised to be seated immediately around 5:30pm on a Friday without having reservations.  While it doesn't say so in the description, this place is like a tapas restaurant.  The server recommended to our table of four that we each order 2-3 things and share amongst the table.  While we enjoyed our cocktails we scanned the menu.  This place has a fantastic beer and cocktail menu too.  We ordered the pierogi flatbread, chicken wings, sliders, steak tartare, mussels, chorizo tacos and the josper roasted chicken.  Everything was fantastic but what stood out were the sliders, tacos and the flatbread.  The sliders may have been the best burger I've ever eaten.  Tacos were flavorful and delicious.  The flatbread was like an open faced potato pierogi.  It was absolutely to die for.  The steak tartare was very good.  Unfortunately, most at our table wouldn't even try it.  That's fine....more for me!  The sliders were good, but the choice of blue cheese with them was odd.  Not a good pairing with seafood.  Service was great and the music they played in the restaurant was AWESOME!  We will definitely be back next time we are in Cleveland!!"}
{"text":"This place is simply amazing, some of the best food CLE has to offer."}
{"text":"Two words: PIEORIGE. FLATBREAD.  Ok, disclaimer: pierogies are my all-time favorite food. But you'd think that should make me more critical, and let me tell you, this flatbread really out-did my expectations. I've had mashed potato pizza before and expected at the very least this would just taste like that. But no, somehow they seriously encapsulated all the flavors of an original potato and cheese pierogie all on this flatbread. It was seriously amazing; I tried stopping to save leftovers by ate the whole dang thing!  Other than the flatbread, I ordered the bacon wrapped dates which were also very good. For a drink, I got the Nitro Albino Stout which was incredible! I'm a fan of nitro brews and of stouts, but never had a blonde one like this - so good! It was much lighter than your original stout but still had that milky flavor. Delicious! I wish I lived around here so I could try more from this place, but I was super impressed with all that I had."}
{"text":"While we were in town for a conference, my group and I came here for lunch based on the reviews.  We were not disappointed!  After calling for a last minute reservation, Jason was very accommodating.  Although we arrived a few minutes late, we were warmly greeted and promptly seated in a private room -- what a pleasant surprise!  Despite being late, we also had to be out the door in a very small window of time.  Elizabeth hooked it up!!  Orders were placed, drinks (shots) were had, a delicious lunch was consumed -- and we never felt like we were running behind or being rushed.  In addition, members of my entourage can be picky about what they eat -- and everyone loved their meals!!    Thanks, Hodge!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere.  Food was amazing across the board but,  very pricey.  I own a angus beef farm and I know what prime cuts of meat goes for. I would definitely recommend the bone marrow if you've never had it.  It's very good."}
{"text":"After reading all these reviews for \"Cleveland's Best New Restaurant\", we had such high hopes for Butcher & The Brewer. Man, were we disappointed.  Let me tell you, I was not expecting to have AMAZING service, especially in a restaurant as big and as packed as this place (and since I am a server myself, I feel for these people running around like crazy) and we did go on a night with two concerts and a home Indians game. My boyfriend and I met up with some family friends of his and right when we sat down our waitress showed up to take our drink orders. I love beer, but seeing \"Draft Wine\" on the menu made my heart pitter-patter. My boyfriend stuck with the Farmhouse Rouge, while our friend ordered the Le Boucher and four appetizers for us to share right off the bat. This is, sadly, where things began to go downhill. My boyfriend's beer came out in a regular 12 oz. glass and it was a bright orange-y yellow color. The menu said that the Farmhouse Rouge was an amber, and I even commented how brightly colored it was, but continued sipping my DRAFT WINE (still excited about this). It was also a little hoppy for his taste at first, but the more he drank the more he enjoyed it. Our friend's Le Boucher was a deep maroon color that came in a smaller snifter glass. One by one, our appetizers arrived. The sliders, while a tad overcooked, were delicious thanks to the brioche bun and the spicy mayo. The corndogs were also delicious, no carnival wieners here. The whole wings (which were just okay) were brought out to us by our actual waitress, not a food runner, so we asked about our fourth and final appetizer we were waiting on, the one we were all the most excited about: the bone marrow. She said she would gladly go and check on it for us and that it should be up any minute. Well, that any minute soon turned into 20 minutes. Then 25 minutes. Our waitress came back to see if we needed any drinks, with no last appetizer in her hands. Our friend asked about the bone marrow AGAIN, and changed his beer to a Farmhouse Rouge, which my boyfriend ordered again and I ordered another glass of wine.   Now things just get a little strange. The waitress comes back and tells us that they are out of bone marrow and have been all night. Considering we ordered the appetizers almost an hour prior and we were just being told this right then after asking about it several times, we were a little iffy. But mistakes do happen, and she said she would buy us the round of drinks we were waiting on for the trouble. In comes my wine, and then in comes the two snifters of a marooney, dark Farmhouse Rouge. WAIT, WHAT?? Right as she puts his glass down, my boyfriend looks at her and says, \"Wait, we both ordered the Farmhouse Rouge?\" and, kind of in a snotty tone, she replies, \"Yeaaaah, that's what this is.\" Since he had ordered it before and this obviously was a completely different beer in color, taste, even glass it was served in, he asks what the first beer he was served actually was. She says she's not sure and walks away. Okay then? Today, we still have no idea what beer he drank when we arrived there. It will forever be a mystery.   We decided to order entrees as well, and all I can say is stay away from the shrimp and grits. The grits, the poached egg, and the large pieces of pork belly were delicious on their own, but they couldn't save the dish from the very fishy shrimp. Instead of being plump and sweet, they tasted almost like shrimp cocktail, the kind you can tell aren't fresh and were probably frozen a while ago. For a $16 price tag, it just wasn't worth it. Come to this establishment for the beer (if you are actually served the one you order), the draft wine (STILL YAY!), and an appetizer, but don't expect stellar service or seafood for the price. Probably won't be returning or recommending it any time soon, and that makes me sad."}
{"text":"I was visiting my hometown of Cleveland for a conference and stumbled upon this place while out with colleagues. We had drinks standing at a barrel/table and our server was super-nice. Later we moved to the bar and enjoyed the view through the glass. The bartenders were not inattentive but they were not attentive, either. (It helped that they were very good-looking!) I had the blood orange shandy and it was delish. My only regret is not visiting the bathrooms because everyone was talking about them!   The place is huge (at least by Boston standards!) and I can imagine it'll really rock when it's packed. I look forward to checking it out again next time I'm in town. Best of luck to you, B&B!"}
{"text":"Firmly established as one of my favorite spots in Cleveland - it helps that my trips here usually accompany a Cavs or Indians game. Good beers that continue to improve. Good shared plates and appetizers.  Great ambiance."}
{"text":"albino stout is money  tad pricey food  great location  top 4 bathrooms in Cleveland  good vibes  nice date spot"}
{"text":"First- the service.  The staff here is very accommodating, friendly, and knowledgeable. I should have gotten our server's name- she was awesome! This place is big and open.  WARNING: it is loud on a weekend night, but I think it adds to the energy :)  Our oysters were delicious, the fried cauliflower is always AMAZING, as well as the mushroom flatbread and the pierogi flatbread.  They have round tables for big groups, a long bar, an outside drinking area, and plenty of bathrooms.  The PERFECT place to share food with friends before a game, concert, or just a fun night out."}
{"text":"Do no go here if you want to have an actual meal in somewhat privacy! Tried to have a late night dinner here while visiting Cleveland. There are very few times where I have actually gotten up and walked out of a place, but this was one of those situations! We were greeted by two not so friendly hostesses. When we told them that we wanted to eat dinner, one of them brought us over to a cramped high top table that was already FULL of people. Meanwhile, there was a perfectly good dining room area right behind the bar. We asked if we could sit there and the hostess became extremely irritated and told us that the dining room was closed because the servers were leaving. We asked to speak with a manager and she continued to argue with us. At that point, we just turned around and walked out and went to the pub down the street that greeted us, sat us at our own table, and was very attentive to our needs!"}
{"text":"I read every single review that came in at 3-stars or under and aside from the usual \"I feel like being a douchebag and this is my only review and have zero friends\" one-star reviews, there appears to be a common thread running through all of them. If you feel like reading all of them for yourself, by all means, please do. If you want to save those minutes of your life for something more meaningful, please allow me to summarize:  1. This Place is Loud Indeed, Butcher and Brewer is pretty damn loud. From what I gathered, most of the noise complaints came when people visited on game days. We didn't visit on the eve of any particular sporting event that happened to be occurring downtown so it was more a loud din than a blasting cacophony. Still, I do agree, it's up there decibel-wise.  2. It's Expensive Agreed, but compared to what? I love when people complain about price for a restaurant that makes everything from scratch, in-house to-order. Butcher & Brewer is expensive, but you're downtown, you're on E 4th Street. What the hell isn't expensive down there? I was a bit taken aback with the $10 price tag on a 4-beer flight (if you add additional beers to the flight they're $3 a piece) but everything else is in line with others in the vicinity and the old adage \"you get what you pay for\" is apropos.  3. Customer Service Is Lacking This one I didn't personally experience. Sure, the hostess wasn't exactly beaming with delight but our server was pretty friendly and attentive. Our waters were always filled, our food came out quickly and was well-paced and she stopped by a few times to check in. I don't know what most people are expecting, but I found the service to be pretty damn good.  Our Experience:  So the atmosphere, let's start there. It's definitely got that \"I'm downtown so I gotta be extra hip and sexy\" vibe to it. The lighting is dim, there are gads of giant flat screen televisions above the bar (probably where most of the light is coming from) and the brewery is clearly visible at the very back of the restaurant. Long bar to the left, communal tables up front, more traditional chair & table set up toward the rear. We were seated up front.  We were there on a Tuesday around 6ish and the place was pretty deserted. A few souls at the bar, a few scattered at tables and us. For as empty as it was, it did take our server some time to come back to take our drink orders. Speaking of drinks, if you come here you've gotta try their beer. Brewed under the Cleveland Brewery name, their beers are really good. Not mindblowing, per se, just really solid.  Overall, the food was pretty tasty. We started with some crusty French bread served with three different spreads. We followed that with a couple of small plates including a flatbread and the house-smoked corndogs. The flatbread was tasty, gooey cheese, fried egg and garlic oil on crispy/chewy crust - but the corndogs were delicious. Just the right amount of smoke flavor and the cornbread was perfectly seasoned.  One we got through noshing on the starters we opted to share the hand-ground burger ($12). The locally-sourced grass-fed beef was moist, tender and flavorful. Cooked a perfect medium, the port salut cheese made the perfect compliment to the juicy, beefy goodness. My only criticism would be on the presentation. The burger was plopped u ceremoniously onto the center of a large, round plate. It just seems sparse and lonely, is all. Some fries would have kept it company.  I'd say our trip was a good one. The food was good, service was good and the beer was good. Definitely a solid 4-star experience. While I personally would avoid this place during any downtown sporting event or concert as I have a feeling it would be busting at the seems, others may find the crowds just their thing.   Be warned, parking may be a bit of a challenge when visiting this area. We managed to find a meter right out front (talk about your luck) but I have a feeling if you can't snag one of those during your visit you'll be forking over $10 to park somewhere else. Just be prepared."}
{"text":"Outstanding menu that presents interesting and flavorful takes on the typical pub food.  The list of appetizers was impressive, I really enjoyed the bacon wrapped dates.  The french fries were good, but the home make vinegar aioli and ketchup took them from good to great.  The four cheese flat bread done to perfection, with a quality cheese and a very good crust. It is also a great place to watch a sporting event... a long row of big screens that are viewable from almost every seat in the place.   I look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"I got a burger and the corn dogs which I really enjoyed.  They brew their own beer, which was tasty.  I went with a group of 4 and everyone loved their meal.  My only complaint is the bathroom.  If you look at the pictures posted it is shared with a sink in the middle.  So as a lady I came out of the bathroom and washed my hands.  Creepy guys on the other side trying to look down my shirt as I was bent down washing.  Then I was trying to primp in the mirror.  Creepy old guys leering and hovering the whole time.  It was so very uncomfortable.  I will probably be back here for a quick drink in the future but I will never go to the bathroom here again."}
{"text":"Butcher & The Brewer is the jewel of East 4th Street!  I've planned and attended multiple corporate and social events at Butcher & The Brewer. My findings are as follows : A.) The food is decadently on-point B.) The beers are spectacular (Albino Stout!!) C.) The staff is outstanding D.) It's a guaranteed good time  You really can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the patio for some beers and appetizers on a late Saturday afternoon. They weren't busy outside and our service was excellent. Everyone was pleased with their beers and we snacked on the soft pretzels, served warm with cheese and grainy mustard, and the patatas bravas. The patatas were amazing, not super authentic to Spanish food but so good. We didn't opt for egg or chorizo on them and it wasn't necessary."}
{"text":"OMG.  Straight up decadent.  Not a steal, but my god, if you want good food and have the calories and money to spare, come here. I would rather live like an ascetic monk the rest of the year than not experience some of the amazing, fatty, salty, cheesy delicacies served at Butcher and Brewer.  I can't lie -- I'm from out of town, and I was not psyched for the Cleveland food scene. Butcher and Brewer delivered me from that misconception. I  had stuffed shishito peppers, chorizo tacos, and the bacon pork belly breakfast thing (name long forgotten in favor of the memory of the taste on my tongue). The pork belly on toast with egg was by far my favorite; an absolute bliss. The tacos were filled with chorizo. The peppers were a good filler -- not stuffing but enough to pass the time. Also wonderful.  One of my great fears about any tapas restaurant is that it will not be enough food. Here I had no problem at all -- a very good dinner of multiple dishes for two people also ordering a drink each came to around $60.  I had ordered a dessert, but you saw my list of foods -- and our waitress was kind enough to return the dessert. I would probably have died if I had eaten it.  I wanted it.  Till next time..."}
{"text":"Hung out before an Indians game. Had their Smoked Bone Marrow and their Sliders. Everything was delish! Not to mention their great selection of beers made in house. Surely won't be my last visit."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is fun and the food is amazing.   Must try: Bone Marrow Lamb Shank  Mac and Cheese all the beer  Only complaint -- service was a bit slow!"}
{"text":"Great place for large groups as the plates and food can be passed around to try a bit of everything. The  sausage, shrimp & grits, and mussels were amazing. Don't forget the calamari for an appetizer. The service was amazing."}
{"text":"Food was good and atmosphere was even better. I ordered the Stake Tartare and it was delicious. The house beers are also good and there is a wide selection from heavy and strong to light and mild beers. There is also a rich spirit and wine list.   The food was a little pricey for the portion size. The restaurant also features only shareable plates. Not a bad thing but it did catch me off guard a little. This is a fun place for a date or a group of friends to go and have a few."}
{"text":"Do it.  Interesting.  Little bit pricy but who cares when is this good. Smart,  fun food"}
{"text":"They have great cocktails and appetizers. It was really busy and we had a large party but there was plenty of room on the other side of the bar by the meatcase for us to get drinks and snacks. Everything was delicious. It seems a little pricey though for fancy bar food. It's really nice inside. I asked for suggestions for cocktails from the bartender, they tasted great but he overall seemed annoyed. Overall I recommend going here!"}
{"text":"Good food, but LOUD. The tables are big and communal, it's a big open space, and if you're not prepared to shout at your friends, don't go. Having said that, the portions were generous, the beet salad was delicious, the fish was tender and flavourful, the mac and cheese was on the salty side, the tempura cauliflower was light, crispy, and terrific. Service was friendly and responsive."}
{"text":"Stopped in Tuesday night for dinner.  First time in so we were looking forward to it.  Sat at the bar and think I counted 4-5 'bartenders' all guys who between them had zero personality.  We finished some very average appetizers and our empty plates sat at the bar for 15 minutes even when 2 of the bartenders stood staring at them as they chatted.  I wanted to grab dinner somewhere else but my friends convinced me to stay.  What a mistake.  Pork Shank was dry and seemed microwaved!  Bartenders still stood behind the bar looking disinterested and not cool!!! Really wanted this place to kick ass but ended up very disappointed.  Maybe they are still working out the bugs but for effs sake bartenders...how about some personality and smile!!!   Will try it again when it's completed (6-8 weeks according to non smiling, pissed off bartender)."}
{"text":"We've got ourselves another contender, Cleveland! The Butcher & the Brewer opens to the public on East 4th Street this Friday and I'm so excited for this addition to the neighborhood! Again, through my amazing friends, I was able to attend the soft opening of one of the finest new restaurants in Cleveland. This place will eventually function as a full restaurant, brewery, butcher shop and Speakeasy.. I'm sure I'm missing something else - these people are that cool! They've got all they need for a successful business in downtown Cleveland - good food, fresh-brewed cold beer, genuine service and an amazing space that will wow Clevelanders and any guests we bring with us. My friend and I split the bacon wrapped dates, fresh baked pretzel and the spicy kimchee wings. The whole menu looked delicious so I'm looking forward to coming back and trying more. I'll keep you all posted as I continue to visit - this place is so cool I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I walked out of this place still hungry. The portions are small. I would say to only go to this place if your just trying to have a drink and a snack."}
{"text":"Makes my trips to Cleveland a bit more challenging in that used to head to Greenhouse Tavern as a no-brainer for their decor, interesting rotating beer selections, and eclectic menu.  Now there is this place, with many in house selections as well as guest taps.  Huge interior that is interestingly laid out, the beer is the draw here and all of the food pairs well with something on tap.  Especially loved the bone marrow."}
{"text":"First of all: hands down the best patatas bravas I've ever had! Cool place, great food, reasonable price and awesome service: shout out to Carl, our amazing waiter who was so kind and friendly that we could not wait to tell other people about him! Will definitely come back whenever we are in town again."}
{"text":"Fun vibe, tasty food - slow but friendly service. Small plates which makes it perfect for sharing. Menu has a wide variety of selections. The sliders were delicious, washed down with a glass of the Saison D'ete. Appreciate that they offer a 5oz sampling for non-beer drinkers. The wings were also delish. Great outdoor seating. Bustling and jovial atmosphere."}
{"text":"Beautiful place ! The beers are made on sight and so is the meat (hence the name ) it's in a row with a lot of other restaurants. We had the Mac and cheese we added bacon and the chorizo tacos it's served tapas style small plates to share. Food was delicious ! The only thing is we came the weekend of the republican convention and it had left its skid mark of people. Didn't give it 5 stars because I didn't have any alcohol, can't review that."}
{"text":"We went there recently with a group of friends sat at one of the round tables up front. Our server was amazing!!! I can't remember her name but we told management, shorter woman with short hair (sorry I don't recall your name but you rock!). We have been to plenty of restaurants lately and honestly this was the best service we have had compared to places such as marble room, which I believe says a lot. Didn't order too much food except for oysters and sides, and those were very good. Cocktails and beer were yummy. Thank you for the experience!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, excellent beer - loved the \"Stop Hop Kaboom\".  Food was outstanding.  Recommend the Dates, Pork Shank and Lamb Ribs."}
{"text":"Solid stand-up of a place. The ale here is awesome so are the sliders and tacos. I stop in every once in a while and everything is always delicious. The staff is warm and the location and vibe is even better. Classic Cleveland- love it or leave it!"}
{"text":"Our server Jane was fantastic.  She made the right suggestions for our food & beverages. Everything was great.  Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Small plates, american fare. Our Food Team 4 came in HUNGRY and did not leave disappointed.  From the time we ordered, we were presented with a flurry of food delivery.  The things we ordered were brought out as prepared, which led to a civilized human version of Hungry, Hungry Hippos.   In the course of 30 minutes, we slammed down sausages, laid waste to lobster rolls, and chomped on charcuterie.  The sharing nature of the food lends to a super-social environment - very lively, dynamic, and not defined to tables.  The interaction spills over to neighbors, as well.  Some plates that hit the table got the attention of others, in the form of \"Oh! What's that? Can I try that?\"  So, share and share alike!  I recommend the beer sampler - The brewer side of the menu is well planned, and lends well to a progression of the beers.  They're complex, well crafted, and pair really well with the pub food.   The food has a focus on the meats.  The seafood selections we tried were good, but the red meats left the ocean critters in the dust.  The lobster rolls were ok, but anything with sausages were fresh, zesty, and led to a few disputes for the last bite.    Don't expect a regular sit-down meal. Go to be daring, try and share a lot of things, and be in the mood to get a little loud. Perfect if you want to have a bit of everything or are in the mood for snacking.  Get ready to take in the energy of East 4th and whatever event is going on downtown when you visit B&B!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to go before an Indians game! The food is amazing quality and I love the changing menus. The beer and cocktails are refreshing and fun, and if you don't take a jug home with you, you didn't do it right."}
{"text":"Just stopped by for one beer and an app before an Indians game, but WOW!  Such a cool spot. Huge and loud, but fun and different. I love stouts, but never in the summer. Albino stout? Gave it a try and was really pleased. And they have bacon wrapped dates, what more is needed in life?"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE service and even worse food!  We went on the way to a Cavs game, and will never try it again.  The atmosphere was the only redeemable quality."}
{"text":"Stopped here before Cavs v Pelicans game and had the best service from Carl! The only \"negative\" was how dark it was. Carl provided excellent service to our family and made great food and beer recommendations."}
{"text":"This was one of our stops on our beer themed date night. The space was jam packed. I'm not big on crowds. If you read a lot of my other reviews - I'm a short girl and it makes me uncomfortable to stand in the armpits of men that I am familiar with, let alone men that I am not familiar with.  With that said, the beer was good. Lots of offerings and it seems like they change them regularly.   The food. The biggest downer. They do this shareable system. That's fine. LOVE that actually. I'm all about sharing, tasting, and trying new things. However, the system is overpriced and the portions are way too small. (Maybe they can jack up their prices considering their location, but that's meh to me.)   If you're going to serve me 3-4  5 inch smoked lamb ribs for $15, couldn't you at least make sure you gave me ribs that were filled with meat instead of fat? I mean - the amount of chewy disgusting fat on these ribs made me want to go vegan again. No lie. Ha. And they're called \"Butcher\" and the Brewer! Really?! What an embarrassment. I'd be ashamed to offer an unfit portion of meat like that to my dog, let alone to paying customers.  Long story short - go for beer - NOT for food. You can walk further down 4th street, eat at Greenhouse tavern, pay $45 dollars, share a bone-in pot roast AND actually get full without dissecting it all apart to work around that fat. Well, unless you like to eat gummy fat. In that case, do what you do."}
{"text":"Very cool place. We ordered at the bar and asked the bartender we could drink our beers outside. Her absolutely response was squashed by the young hostess as we headed out. She told us the outdoor seating was only for people ordering food so we were guilted in to ordering the pretzels either pimiento cheese dip. They were really good.   Now on to the beer. My boyfriend likes strong IPAs. He wasn't thrilled with either beer (sorry can't remember the names). I ordered a tasting. There was a seasonal stout, the cherry lime shandy, dunkelweisen, and the albino. All were fantastic except the shandy. The taste reminded me of how perm solution smells. The Albino was a blonde stout made with white chocolate and coffee. OMG delicious!! Very smooth and tasty!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service every time. A little loud inside and hard to hear your group, even when sitting directly across from each other."}
{"text":"I always recommend this place to visitors! This restaurant and bar is located right in the middle of East 4th street. Edison bulbs, great decor and a large interior give this place a classier feel. Only came here for drinks and some appetizers. The food was a bit on the pricier side but everything we got tasted delicious. Would definitely recommend to others!"}
{"text":"Sat on the patio the day they opened it. Awesome atmosphere outside although I didn't go inside so I can't speak on that. Perhaps it was the time of day that we went, but the menu was very small. I had the sliders and they were very good. The \"Jake\" beer sample was tasty. The service was nice and prompt in the beginning, then sort of fell off a cliff as it got busier. I am looking forward to trying it as the menu rotates."}
{"text":"If you can get past a number of this gastropub's quirks, you're left with some pretty good beer and food in a vibrant environment.  I'll start with the negatives:  Some people are freaked out by the restrooms with shared sink area--something I've seen at similar places like the Michelin Bib Gourmand-winning The Publican in Chicago (not too shabby a model to follow in itself).  Others are absolutely horrified at the concept of communal seating (another thing found in several Chicago gastropubs), with one couple down our table leaving a minute after being seated.  For myself, the only negative is the kitchen's unwillingness to time the dishes to come out at the same time or in any particular order, offering some lame excuse that they want the food to come out just after its finished being prepared (as if this is only a recent conundrum faced by the restaurant industry).  That all said, what I really enjoyed about B&B is the quality and uniqueness of the menu.  I thought the smoked bone marrow was a highlight appetizer--tasty and decadent, though just a tad under the bone marrow starter at Lolita (a pretty high standard; the difference coming down to the perfectly crisped bread at the latter).  For the less adventurous, the bacon-wrapped dates and, to a lesser extent, the house-smoked corndogs are great ways to start a meal.  As for entrees, I've only had the Bacon & Eggs, which is a thick hunk of seared pork belly with a poached egg, bernaise, and maple syrup.  A very industrial adaptation (in line with B&B's decor) of an Eggs Benedict brunch, transformed into a dinner entree by virtue of sizable portion of pork belly.  I've also heard glowing reviews of the Black Pepper Tofu but never tried it myself.  In the end, you take the good (food) with the bad (suspect service; very loud dining room) and the new, inventive dishes with the old, solid and always enjoyable combinations (e.g., bacon and beer).  Butcher & the Brewer is a great addition to East Fourth and the city's burgeoning food scene as a whole."}
{"text":"Carl was a fantastic server!! The appetizer we had was great and Carl made great suggestions on beers and wine."}
{"text":"We were in Cleveland for a concert and went here afterwards, so it was pretty late. We wanted to make sure that they were still serving food and the hostess told us we could order off the bar menu. Love the look and feel of the decor. Though the open trough sink and large communal bathroom was a bit of surprise. We ordered several plates to share and were immediately told they were sold out of flatbreads even though another waiter told us anything on the front of the menu was available. So we ordered the Patatas Bravas, cauliflower, calamari and chorizo tacos. The potatoes were really good and flavorful and the calamari was decent but nothing special. The chorizo tacos needed something to cut how salty the sausage was. There was goat cheese in the bottom but it was really lacking in terms of variety of flavors. We discovered they were also sold out of the cauliflower as well. The beer was good and there was a wide selection."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars is because of the wait and the noise level. Otherwise, the food was outstanding and the actual wait staff was very attentive and accommodating once we finally got seated. First, I'll rave about the Albino Stout. Absolutely amazing summer beer, light but rich with vanilla. Second, the food. Plates are family/tapas style with plenty in an order to feed two people. The fried chicken was delicious - definitely use the sauce. Mac and cheese was typical baked mac and cheese. The tartare was a hit, but the tacos were a little underwhelming. Third, if it's a day you can call ahead, definitely do so. They told us up front we would only have a 45 minute wait and it turned into 2 hours. Overall, 4 stars and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Always great service and great food. The beer is very good. Staff are very friendly and helpful. One of the best spots on 4th"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Great atmosphere, amazing beer and really good food. Try the albino stout. I've never had a beer like it!"}
{"text":"Went here tonight for a food date with fellow Yelper, Jason W (see his review for pics). If you're lucky to find some street parking that is great, otherwise plan to spend an extra $10 or so on parking. Once you come inside you will be hit with an almost overwhelming smell of meat, but you'll get accustomed to it and it fades after a while. The atmosphere is pretty chill, lots of people at the bar, long tables to share with other diners, and cool beer glasses with the B&B logo on them. Downside to this big space though is that it is very loud, so loud that we had to keep repeating ourselves because we couldn't hear what the other one was saying and we were only two feet apart. There are huge empty walls, maybe put up some sound absorbing panels or something?  I started things off with a 4 beer sampler for $10. Samplers are always a great way to taste what a place has to offer without committing to a full glass just yet. Next up I ordered the Hand-Ground Burger which was pretty tasty and perfectly cooked. Although it's $12 for just the burger, which to me that is a little pricey. To go with my burger I got the Loaded Kennebec Fries for $12 and it's a big enough portion for sharing. Make sure you say loaded kennebec though, because apparently just saying kennebec means regular plain fries, which I don't understand because regular plain fries are usually just called fries? The loaded kennebec fries were tasty, but what wouldn't be tasty with cheese and pork belly on it?  All in all, you'll spend a good buck coming here and paying for parking, but the prices are in-line with it being downtown and the food was good so you can't complain too much. The service is pretty standard and it is really loud inside, but I would recommend this as a place to try at least once; I would check it out again for sure."}
{"text":"Stopped in to try the Albino Stout. Def worth the walk from my hotel. A couple of items caught my eye. Since they cut their own meat I had to try a little off the menu.  Ordered the smoked bone marrow appetizer and the beef tartare. Marrow was a delight - nice and fatty. A little thick on the bread slices but the flavor of the marrow was heaven. Three cuts of bone but one of the bones was the shallow side of the cut. For $14, I would definitely order this again.  Tartare was a bargain too. Not overwhelming with seasoning, with the egg yolk and the cream/radish side, it was a perfect compliment to the brew.  Tried a farmhouse ale as well. Great bargain at about $40 for the brews and awesome snack."}
{"text":"Big open space and really nicely renovated. Dinner was okay, I'd say come here for appetizers!"}
{"text":"Came here with my family in search of a tasty dinner spot downtown. First impression was a very trendy, inviting, gastropub with community style seating and a creative alcohol menu. Great beer and an interesting cocktail selection. The food was described as \"tapas-style\" by our waitress, but many of the plates were dinner-sized. One thing to be aware of is that the food comes out as it's prepared, so order multiple plates to prevent one person eating alone. The food was phenomenal. We ordered the scallops, roasted chicken, and perogi flatbread, however my favorite meal was the shrimp n grits. Amazing cheesy grits and perfectly cooked shrimp were a welcome invite on the 9 degree winter night. Great stop- highly recommend."}
{"text":"This was a GREAT experience.  Timing of dishes was perfect.  We had the Albino stout, The Count, Hefeweissen blend, the Irish Red and Spice Spice Baby.  All were good but Albino Stout was the favorite.  All dishes were tasty!  We had: Tempura Cauliflower, chorizo flatbread, beef sliders, corn dogs, lamp ribs, shrimp and grits(yum!),  and pork chop (sauce was yummy!).  For dessert we had the Maple Pot de Creme which was Delish! We also ordered the brownie with ice cream and peanut butter caramel, which was the only the item we with which we were slightly disappointed because it was dry and apparently flavored with one of the beer stouts.  All in all, we will definitely be back.  Very great experience!"}
{"text":"I can't handle how much I absolutely loved this place. It is in the middle of downtown in a super adorable area, There are large patio lights hanging in the alley where the outdoor seating is. I loved that there was so much seating outside, high tops and tables. It was a great atmosphere. We sat at a \"shared\" table, so another party sat at the table with us, allowing us to have brief conversations to get to know them as well.   For starters we got the corn dogs and oysters. The corn dogs were so delicious. The hotdog was juicy and plump and not too salty, the breading was a little sweet and thick. Oysters were fresh and very good! The Mac and cheese was the best Mac and cheese I've ever had. I debated ordering another one. It's not a wet Mac and cheese. Baked with layers and layers of fresh cheese and breading. I highly recommend it!!! We also got the pork shank -- it was a lot of food so I recommend sharing it. So tender and perfectly cooked and seasoned.  I highly recommend this place! My only regret is not ordering more food."}
{"text":"Called. Super rude.  Worst BBq I have ever had.  Honestely, from Dertroit with BBQ all over the nation including Texas.   Horrible service and food.   Was told \"owner doesn't allow ranch dressing\".   Whatever, dude. U suck."}
{"text":"I think Butcher and the Brewer does an awesome job in every area that really counts! The place is spacious, the hosts are warm and welcoming, the service is on-point (and my servers are always knowledgeable), the beer is good, and the food is super consistent and delicious."}
{"text":"Tried this place based on reviews. My gf and I both really enjoyed our time there. The atmosphere was very nice (dim lights). I don't like eating under spot lights. The decor was trendy. The bathrooms were a first for me...individual stalls with a common hand washing area for men and women. Still offered plenty of privacy where it's needed most;) The food was very good. We had the beets with goat cheese and sliders. Our server Leslie was very helpful and friendly. I reserve my 5 stars for special places. I would gladly return there again.   Oh, also, fast seating for a busy Friday night."}
{"text":"First off I'll start by saying this place has quite possibly the best beer I've ever tasted. It's called Albino Stout and it's incredibly good.  Now on to my review. Went here for dinner the other night and everything besides my main course was fantastic. Great service, great beer, great appetizer but my main course was a disappointment. We got the Patatas Bravas for an appetizer and they were great. Good combination of flavor and crispness. I definitely get this again. Next on to the appetizer which was the smoked lamb ribs. I've gotten this before at this place and until this visit was my favorite menu choice. However this time the flavor was good however there was more fat on the ribs than actual meat which was an incredible disappointment.  Besides that the service was great and the beer will keep me coming back. But the food took a few points off me entirely enjoying the visit."}
{"text":"What a wonderful first time experience! While we waited, the bartender, Donne, suggested specialty cocktails. They were incredible! Our server, Mikey, was exceptional. He walked us through everything and was very patient and helpful with suggestions. We thoroughly enjoyed everything we tried, and can't wait to return. It's almost like walking into a completely different city being there. A true gem to Cleveland!"}
{"text":"The beers are on point, they have really enjoyable appetizers, music is good, I love the albino stout, the corn dogs and the chorizo tacos."}
{"text":"Opinions: - sausage flatbread is basically an oblong sausage pizza. Okay but boring - chorizo tacos are way too salty - tempura cauliflower is really tasty. Comes with an interesting mustard and a berry-yoghurt sauce. Neat. - lamb ribs are absolutely divine. They're a standout item, exceptionally good, and are carrying this review to four stars. They come with a mango chutney that's kind of absurd and unnecessary, and though I wouldn't recommend slathering the ribs in the chutney, the ribs themselves are absolutely fantastic. - the pretzel with cheese/mustard is all right as well. Nothing to write home about, but reasonably tasty, though I've had better pretzel/mustard combos elsewhere. - I had to ask for water? That was a little surprising, service-wise"}
{"text":"I pretty much loved the gin kaboom from this place. It really did taste more like pineapple juice.  The reason why this place got a four star instead of 5 is because we were told that the entree and appetizer were big enough for 3-4 people....(not really true, is more like tapas for one person). Maybe I could be super wrong as well because I'm use to New York portions. But they were definitely not \"big\" enough for 3-4 people with just one order of each.  Tips: order a variety of appetizers and entrees and share :)"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this place is a 4 star restaurant, but I saw so many poor reviews for terrible reasons I had to give them a 5 to help bring up the average.  I do not live in Cleveland, so this is from the perspective of an out of towner.   The beer: I am a cicerone and the beers did not blow me away by any means, but the albino stout was unique enough to make me want to write this review so I have to give it a  stout out. The chocolate and coffee overtones danced across my tongue so gracefully. I also tried the hefeweizen and the framboyzee, which neither struck me as a great beer.  The food: started with the peppers which had a great flavor and the perfect amount of salt. Next was the bacon wrapped dates, their version of a devil on horseback stuffed with chorizo. THESE WERE PHENOMENAL. Next up was the shrimp and grits(bacon on the side). Again, they did not disappoint with 5 large shrimp and a good portion of tasty grits. Next out was the mushroom flatbread. The taste was great for a vegetarian option, but did not resemble most flatbreads I've had in the past. Finally our wings have arrived! Sadly, the wings were the biggest let down. 4 wings that were not very meaty and were wayyyy too salty. Last but not least was the pork shank. This was such a great dish. It includes the shank, beans, slaw, pickled onions, and some chalupa flats. The were great combined or eaten separately.   The service: Our visit was pre Indians game and it was busy. However our waitress did a good job and was attentive.  The atmosphere: Love the lighting the the sound level. Edison style lighting helps set the mood and the acoustics could make even a small group feel like a crowd. I could see how some people wouldn't like either of these, but frankly they aren't fun people anyways. The bathrooms are communal in a sense. You walk into a large room with hand washing tubs deprecating the mans side from the woman. It's private and not weird at all. Nicely done."}
{"text":"The Butcher and the Brewer just screams Cleveland cuisine to me. Fresh, community-style, meaty, artery-clogging goodness. Just expect to pay a pretty penny and you'll leave feeling satisfied. We came here with a large group for a bachelorette party, so we filled up an entire table. It was a Thursday evening and the place was lively but not unbearably loud like the other reviews mention. The decor is cool and the \"unisex\" bathrooms were a nice addition.   We ate and drank a ton. And my goodness, everything was delicious. I tried the bacon wrapped dates (stuffed with chorizo and manchego cheese, brought me back to Spain), smoked whole wings (huge wings with a spicy rub), salt roasted beets (with goat cheese and crushed pistachios - simply divine) and tempura asparagus (good but not wow). The steak tartare was honestly some of the best tartare I've ever had, served with a perfectly poached egg and bread. The meal didn't stop there my friends. We also tried the pierogi flatbread, which by the way is genius. Carbs on carbs? Uhhh sign me up. For dessert we ordered the s'mores brownie, which was a perfect end to our heavenly (and heavy) meal. For drinks the highlight was definitely the Albino Stout, a scrumptious chocolatey-coffee oat ale. I enjoyed the food SO much that I forgot to take photos of most of the dishes, which is completely out-of-character for me.  Yes, the bill was steep, but we got a ton of delicious food and drinks, so well worth it IMHO.   Next time I'm back in Cleveland, you'll probably find me here stuffing my face with steak tartare and pierogi flatbread. Do yourself a favor and get there now."}
{"text":"The food and the service were both amazing. Loved the communal atmosphere too. We were so thankful that they were still serving food at 11:30pm, after a long event at the Rock Hall. We ordered several small plates, and we thoroughly enjoyed each of them. Our 16 year old son loved everything too.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The best Christmas beer I've had. Great selection of beers period, something for everyone. The food was very good and exceptionally fast service. I got the wings and she got the brussel sprouts. First time the wings have arrived before anything else."}
{"text":"First time going here last night.  Although looks very casual don't be put off thinking there's no ambience. The wait staff and bar staff were excellent, friendly and efficient.  I was prepared for standard bar food.  How wrong could I be! The food was delicious!! We were a table of 10 so we shared a lot of dishes, chicken wings, calamari and peppers to start.  Crispy pork shanks, scallops, lamb ribs and steak to name a few all cooked to perfection. Nothing was over seasoned. The beer menu was extensive loved my choice which was recommended by the knowledgeable bar staff. I would highly recommend this place great fun informal evening out."}
{"text":"Beer was very good, although a bit pricy. Food was also pretty good, but not exceptional. Noise level was almost unacceptable. Literally had to shout to our companions across the table. Probably will not return."}
{"text":"I'm a vegan and still loved this place, drinks were great. Very friendly environment."}
{"text":"Great place! I've seen this place on Yelp a few times and when I come to Cleveland and I finally went to try it. The service was great and my waiter was very attentive to my needs and even a little talkative. I think he read me very well, because I was eating alone and at a table he knew not to be too talkative, but still be engaging. Soooooo, I ordered 3 ichabod oyster on the half shell plain and 3 ichabod oysters with the chorizo butter that he recommended. Good recommendation! It was tasty and cooked perfectly. Then I had a meat and cheese board with taleggio, duck heart pate, chicken liver mousse, and another recommendation of the beef sticks? It came with accompaniements like housemade whole grain mustard, honey, cherry compote? jam?, slightly pickled beets and cucumbers. The reason I like to have meat and cheese plates is that the variety of combinations you can make for your palate are so numerous. I thoroughly enjoyed each morsel. Then lastly, I had the steak tartare that came with a 6 minute egg. One of the few best steak tartare's that I've ever eaten. The only one that tops it is the one I had in Paris, which I recreate at home often. The flavors were on point and the texture of the egg went so well with the tartare. First time I've had a 6 minute egg with tartare and it was a success. The only downside was that I'm a lone diner and can only eat so much at a time! So I'm definitely coming back guys because you rocked my tummy and palate."}
{"text":"Okay. Wait for a Saturday night wasn't terrible: 30 mins. Beer is great, and tons of options. My favorite thing we ordered was the Pierogi flat bread, so good. We got the corn dogs and the pretzel as well, which were good just..not as tasty as the flat bread. My friends got the sausage flat bread and loved it and also really enjoyed their tacos and calamari. I think my least favorite thing about the place is how small the portions were for the prices. Everything is supposed to be shareable which...I don't like to share so... haha."}
{"text":"My first review was written when the restaurant first opened. They've since gotten their sh*t together so it's worth posting another review to highlight the improvements.  PROS -Shareable plates. When B&B first opened, they had plates on their shareable menu that were not meant to be shared (i.e. a burger...not sliders). They figured that out and now everything on the menu (well everything I have ordered) is easy to share among friends.  -Delicious food. If the restaurant had a report card, it would get an A on food. I have been here quite a few times in the past few months and have been happy with the delicious food we've ordered every time. The mac and cheese is definitely a fan favorite, as is the pierogi pizza. Food comes out as it is prepared, not all at once FYI. -Albino Stout. I don't even drink beer and I get an Albino Stout every time I come here. It's the most unique beer I've ever had. And one of the most delicious. -Butcher side is now open! It took them a few years, but the butcher part of 'Butcher and the Brewer' is now open. I have yet to buy any meats (sadly, they were out of the bacon I wanted), but I'll definitely be back to get some. They also have a variety of complimentary spices, oils, and other accouterment available for purchase.  CONS -Shared seating. Not necessarily a con, if you don't mind being in close quarters to strangers. Some of the seating are long tables, where it makes sense to seat small groups together. Not really an issue for me, but I could see some people getting annoyed with it if they weren't expecting it.   BOTTOM LINE -If you haven't been here in a few years, give it another chance. You'll be happy with the improvements they've made!"}
{"text":"Seriously, one of our favorite go-to places downtown. It's so simple, yet modern and an industrialized atmosphere, right up my alley. The menu is obviously known for it's handmade beer, made-from-scratch right from the back of the restaurant, which is amazing if you're a real hand crafted beer fan. A couple Ale's, a couple IPA's, a little of everything for every different taste. You really won't find another great brewery, hand-crafted like these anywhere around the area. The whole menu is made up of natural, non-processed, no antibiotics food. They thrive on buying everything from their vegetables to their meat, locally. They work with local farmers' markets who provide everything they need, which is exactly what I'm looking for in a great restaurant. Nowadays, these types of restaurants are getting bigger and bigger. More people are starting to understand the importance of \"locally grown\" food and processed by-products. These guys don't f--- with anything like that. The menu is made to be more of a \"pass the plate\" type of deal. They serve entrees similar in size to appetizers, and the whole idea behind it is to try a bunch of different plates. The menu itself has a modern feel to it and you can tell when they bring the food out, that they are going for something \"different' or out-of-the-box. Exactly the type of thing we look for when looking up a new restaurant.   Overall, I'm quite disappointed with the amount of bad reviews on here for them. I'm not sure if I missed something from the 5 times I've been there thus far, but I will say that if you're not a hand-crafted beer fan to begin with-you probably won't be into this type of style, simple. Example: You wouldn't go to Melt if you weren't a cheese fan to begin with, same deal here. Research your stuff out before you go."}
{"text":"This is a pretty cool restaurant that serves Tapas style type dishes...pretty much, the dishes that they prepare, and serve are meant to be shared.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anybody that simply wants to enjoy the evening eating well prepared dishes as well as the ambience.    I would definitely come back whenever I come back to Cleveland, Ohio. :)"}
{"text":"Butcher & The Brewer was the first place we stopped at upon arriving in Cleveland to see a Cubs World Series game. It quickly became apparently that it was going to be the only place we stopped at before the game. Atmosphere was casual, and the noise level decent enough so that you could hold a conversation. Service was top notch, as bartenders were quick and efficient and treated us warmly despite the fact that my friends and I were all dressed in Cubs gear. The albino stout is one of the better beers I've had in recent memory. Atmosphere feels old school and slightly upscale. Try the beef and cheddar if it's on the menu, as it was during the World Series. Excellent rendition on a classic sandwich. Next time I'm in Cleveland, I'll be coming back here."}
{"text":"This may be my new favorite restaurant.   Honestly, I was skeptical. The whole \"community style\" made me think it would just be overpriced, small plates... And that I would go away hungry. But it was fantastic.   We started off with a Cobb Salad. It was perfectly crisp. With bleu cheese, tomatoes, amazing huge chunks of bacon and a green goddess dressing. An amazing start.   Next we had corn dogs. Not my favorite, but overall it was okay.   Next course was Mac and Cheese. Holy Crap! So fantastic!!! Honestly. No Mac and cheese comes close.   Next we had their special of pork with peaches and cherries and honey glaze. It was so tender. And the sauce was out of this world. Sweet with a bit of spice.   Finally. The best thing of the night.  A Malt Chocolate Bomb. My mind was blown. It had a chocolate ice cream. With a thick almost mouse. And a lil cookie.  Best dessert we have ever eaten.   And our server, Michael, was fantastic. He was so attentive. He really let us know all the specials and was able to give us recommendations. He was honest and really helped us get the right amount of food.   Overall it was fantastic. A little pricey, but the food was totally work it."}
{"text":"Pretty amazing place with a great staff.   We let our server recommend the best and that is what we got.   Bone marrow and pork shank entree.  Cannot go wrong!!"}
{"text":"Attempted to eat at restaurant on a Saturday evening. Hostess told us it would be 45 minute wait. 40 minutes later we were told it would be another 25 minutes. That turned it to be a severe underestimate. It was 2 hours 43 minutes before the restaurant text us to inform us that our table was ready. Needless to say we chose to eat elsewhere.   When I emailed ownership to complain they informed me that their entire table and reservation system has been a complete failure and to please give them a second chance. They promised to send gift cards. It's been over a month and I'm still waiting for the gift cards.  I will never think of eating there again.  What a sad excuse for a restaurant in downtown Cleveland"}
{"text":"I came for lunch. You can walk into the left side , where it looks like a store and order from the butcher. You order and pay and then go sit down and they'll bring it to you. It takes a little bit of time to get your food and that's how you know it's made to order.  They have patio seating outside.   This place is hands down my favorite sandwich/sub/butcher/ whatever you want to call it place. Butcher is literally in the name of this place and it doesn't disappoint. I swear they have a little farm in the back because that's how fresh the meat is. Portion size for each of the sandwiches we ordered were HUGE. We had a second meal for later. The pairings of the cheese and other veggies/condiments paired together with the meat and their fresh bread was superb ... You might even call it superhuman having a lunch meal be so good. They have drinks and chips you can pair with your sandwich.   I can't think of one single thing that was bad about this place. My only complainant is I don't live around here and can't come here on a weekly ...maybe even daily basis!   I bet if you brought a vegan here it would flip their mind around about not eating meat..yeah it's that good."}
{"text":"We ordered the Crispy Pork Shank, Smoked Lamb Ribs, Breakfast flatbread. The lamb ribs were fantastic. The flavor was great, and they are very tender.   We didn't know what to expect with the breakfast flatbread, but it turned out to be really good. The combination of egg and bacon on the flatbread was surprisingly good.   The Crispy Pork Shank was definitely my favorite of the three. The meat is crispy on the outside but tender on the inside. We didn't even really have to use the knife to get the meat off the bones; they just fell right off with a little shake. The pork shank came with naan bread and kimchi. The combination of the three is so delicious.   I loved all three, but the ones you should really try are the crispy pork shank and lamb ribs."}
{"text":"There's something to be said about a balance of decadence and a parochial dedication to service that seems to be the mainstay of this pearl of Cleveland.   Dishes consumed: Bone Marrow, Scallops, Mussels, Calamari, Lamb Ribs, Charcuterie, Broccolini, Tempura Cauliflower.   The understated champion of the evening was the scallops. With their succulent flavor of the scallops with a celery pur√©e that made quite a power couple of the pair.   Everything else had made due on its full flavor, however the muscles did leave something to be desired in regarded for people living in or visiting Cleveland."}
{"text":"Great customer service and consistently good food. When we had to wait for one of our dishes to come out a little longer than usual, the house comped it and we hadn't even complained. This place is a gem. Order the broccolini and a cheese board you won't be disappointed. Keep it up Butcher you guys are doing a great job."}
{"text":"Delicious gastropub food, some of which is pretty eclectic. The public house style is noisy, but fun. We had nice people come and go from our table, and it was nice to hear the food experiences of our neighbors to help with our order. The plates are small, so you don't have to worry too much about committing to something you don't like. That said, we ordered 4 items and liked everything."}
{"text":"After flying in from Milwaukee, we stopped in for a late dinner and a few beers. The atmosphere was great and the food was terrific. The service was really good, especially given how packed the place was. I'll definitely make it a point to visit if/when I'm back in town.  Food 5/5 The real star of this place is the amazing food. We ordered the bone marrow, shishito peppers and the steak tartare, all of which were fantastic. Easily the best bone marrow I've ever had. As if that wasn't enough the beers we're amazing as well. The albino stout was my personal favorite.  Atmosphere 4/5 We luckily snagged a couple seats at the bar on the butcher side of the bar. The butcher counter and case we're awesome looking and well designed. The only downside was that the place was really crowded and the stools we're a bit snug to the bar, but that is more nitpicking than really problematic. The bathrooms we're... unique as well.  Service 5/5 The service was fantastic, especially given how packed the place was. My beer was always full, and the food came out fast. Everyone was really friendly and gave us great recommendations."}
{"text":"This is my second time here. I absolutely love it. Yes it's a bit expensive but certainly worth it. the food is awesome!  It's a very loud restaurant - if you can snag a table outside that's your best bet. The scallops on celery root pur√©e was one of the best dishes I've ever had!!"}
{"text":"It's ok, not for me, but not terrible. We went for a Saturday night meal last weekend. The acoustics of that big cavernous room make for a \"shouty\" dinner experience. I couldn't wait to get out of there so I could hear myself think. As a bar, or place to grab a beer before a game, it's probably fine. There are FAR better dinner options on 4th though."}
{"text":"Now, I do need to admit I haven't eaten a meal here, but I have had brews and appetizers and they were all amazing.  We've only visited Cleveland twice, but both times we've made a stop at this place.  The service has been great and SO friendly.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"While visiting college in Cleveland stopped by for dinner.  In a nice part of downtown on a pedestrian block with lots of restaurants and bars.  House brewed beer was very worthy.  Food was very good as well.  Shared meat and cheese board and sliders. Both were excellent.  Hip crowd.  I suspect the later it gets it turns more in to the party crowd.  Very cool space.  Not sure what it used to be but the building is pretty neat.  It would be a great venue to host an event downstairs.  Good music playing so a little on the noisy side."}
{"text":"Tried here a second time. Hostess was way more pleasant (they weren't busy and it was a Sunday). Sat at the bar, ordered a four sample flight. We shared pork shank with a side of Brussel sprouts. The Brussel sprouts were really good, Pork shank was cooked well but bland. It came with three different condiments which were all average. Beers were all average- ended up buying a sample of all 10 of their beers. Bartender was friendly, I was disappointed she never offered us an oyster and meat and cheese menu- she excitedly told the couple next to us \"they had to try something off that menu\". Food- good but a soft attempt at being \"trendy\". Decor- original and it fits the theme. Service- better this time around ... Nothing really captured my interest in going again."}
{"text":"The best broccoli I've ever had. Small plates, so a bit pricey, but something for everyone. Incredible food and beer."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic in all areas. Decor is very trendy and hip. You could be wearing an old T-shirt and jeans or business suit and feel at home though.   Started experience off with the dunkel. I figured it was the top listed beer on the menu, so it had to be good. I was extremely happy with my choice. Nice clean crisp taste on the beer with a slightly happy finish.  The food held up as well which isn't usually the case in establishments that brew their own beer. I started out with the beets and goat cheese. I can't ever pass up beats on a menu. Nice and crunchy lots of acidity cut nicely by the go cheese. If you're in the beat I would highly recommend this one.  Next For my entr√©e I had the pork shank. This came recommended to me by a regular who happened to be sitting at the bar next to me and who had also just polished one hour. Really glad I ran into this guy!   They drop the pork shank in the fryer right before serving to give it a nice crispy crunch on the outside that really adds to the texture of the juicy pork shank. all you'll need is a fork to take this one down it's so tender. At the end I was literally knowing on the bone trying to get every little morsel half of it. Also served with the pork shank was a housemaid kimchi and have the right amount of acidity to help you cut through the grease and richness of the meet.  Can definitely confirm next time I am downtown in Cleveland I will be going back to this place!"}
{"text":"Just stopped in for a quick beer while waiting on some folks to arrive. Had such an unpleasant bartender that I didn't even order, and came next door to Pickwick. Most bartenders at least day hello."}
{"text":"Me and the new man went here after we saw Bill Burr at Pickwick. My almost bf knows how much I love beef tar tare and bone marrow, so that is exactly what we got. He got the Albino Stout and it is LITERALLY the best beer I have ever had. And I try a lot of beers, can never pick a favorite, until now! (Not an IPA fan though). The albino stout is the best, I was drinking a Nero wine but switched to Albino once I had a sip of his. Its an airy light colored beer with firm yet sweet coffee notes. AMAZING. Now onto the bone marrow; the pickled red onions on there were such a nice contrast to the savory umami marrow. And beef tartare is always a win, wish they would have toasted the bread with it. Service was good too. It was after a Cavs game so it was bumpin, but our server was attentive even though she was very busy."}
{"text":"We barely waited for our food but they were very apologetic about us waiting. Also the food was great and the beer was awesome so everything about this place was overly pleasant. Thanks Cleveland for an amazing experience!!!"}
{"text":"This is a beautiful place. Make sure to visit the restrooms down stairs. The oysters we amazing! The plates are more Tapas style, more for sharing. It was a week night, but there were a ton of things going on downtown, and we didn't have to wait to be seated. Our waitress was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"This is what is becoming the stereotypical urban restaurant I believe. Dark, noisy, overpriced, and confusing.   The IPA was well-balanced, and the other beer drinkers at my table of 9 were satisfied with their selections.   Ordering food was another story. The menu says they encourage family-style sharing and that 2-3 plates are suggested per person. When we asked the waitress, she gave us varying estimated amounts for each dish however. Some of the dishes were enough for one person, some were meant to be for two people, and some were too small for one person to be satisfied. My date and I chose to order starters instead of a meal, since the peasant food served was outrageously overpriced. $12 for four wings?  I was very frustrated by this restaurant. The only saving graces were the good beer and tasty food. I will not return. I feel like their serving style is a scam."}
{"text":"My favorite thing about this place is that they work diligently with local farmers to source the highest quality pasture raised meats available. They also serve local, seasonal vegetables and brew their own craft beverages on site. It would be nice to see them brew their own Cider as well. Aside from the restaurant, they have a butcher shop and market that serves lunch specials and sells fresh cut meats, local eggs, kombucha and other pantry items.  We browsed the market during the afternoon as we were passing by and then returned later that night for dinner. I only have photos of the market because the lighting was so dim during dinner. They have public house style seating and encourage shared plates among parties. Plates are served as they are ready so you end up eating in courses. They also have open concept style restrooms with men on one side, women on the other and a trough style washing station in the center. Pretty neat.  We ordered 3 plates to share for the two fo us and I would say it was the right amount of food. The Chorizo Tacos had some hidden sour cream that was not listed on the menu. You get two per order. I thought they were delicious but my sour cream hating husband was disappointed. The Bacon Wrapped Dates stuffed with chorizo, manchego cheese and plated with a piquillo sauce. I didn't taste the cheese and the sauce was very sweet. You get 3 per order. Lastly, the Pierogi Flatbread. Seeing pictures from previews reviews I noted it came with sour cream so if not a fan, ask for it on the side like we did. Even if you are, it's truly not needed. It was delicious and would be even better if they would top it with some of their crumbled house butchered local bacon.  If I return, I'd probably forgo the tacos and dates and order the Crispy Pork Shank. We both enjoyed the Stop Hop Kaboom house American IPA. The menu has gluten free and vegetarian options labeled and vegan options available upon request."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here with some friends on some random weeknight. It was alright. The service wasn't that great and it was really loud. But, the food was good. I had a burger which was really good. We had some lamb that my husband loved. And the waffle dessert was also very good. Even though I thought about giving it a three because it was entirely too loud and service was lacking, the food saved it."}
{"text":"Really nice new spot on east 4th, might become my new favorite if they had a happy hour or cheaper food options. It might become it anyways  The beer: I had the milk stout which was spot on if not unique. It was rich, smooth, and flavorful.  The framboyzee was a tasteful play on framboise, but much more beer like and not overly sweet, a raspberry wheat beer. I highly recommend it to those who like girly beers or manly men open to new flavors.  And the hip hop boom ipa was nicely balanced. Definitely trying more, everything was good!   The food: Everything is pricey or small, but exquisite! I like how most everything is sharable (I always want to try everything) and good on top of that. The smoke lamb ribs with a chimichurry and pineapple cilantro topping was amazing, the shucked oysters were surprisingly edible given my distaste for snot textured foods, and the tempura asparagus was good before we let it get cold, but was a little on the bland side. But the sea bass? Oh my Lord the sea bass! It was amazing. One of the best dishes I've had recently and the best bass or any other white fish I've ever eaten! Get it, Get it now.  The decor: At first I thought it was a bit cheesy to have black and white tvs behind the bar, even if they were huge and beautiful, but as a huge sports fan and fine food connoisseur, it makes a lot of sense! You don't get the sports bar ambiance of Rainbow lighting blowing up your walls, but you can still keep up with what's going on or pick this place to watch a game without ruining the fine dining vibe! Otherwise the building is beautiful, awesome bar and tables, unique bathrooms, and very spacious.  The future: well they still need a sign out front as it's hard to find, and the bar tender assured me that would be remedied this week. Then they still are working on opening the attached butcher shop and downstairs speakeasy. I'll definitely be back to check on their progress!"}
{"text":"I went with a group of friends and we split about 8 dishes. They were all wonderful. The Mac and cheese might be my favorite in Cleveland (and I consider myself a connoisseur). I also really loved the kale salad, corn dogs, breakfast flatbread and I can't remember the rest but it's all good. It's a trendy spot in a great area, so if you're a tourist, this would be a great place to go to!"}
{"text":"We stopped into this cozy restaurant and we were very impressed with their tasty beer selection and food.  It was my first visit to Cleveland and my husband was showing me around.  We were in the area for the NBA Finals festivities.   We had to take a break due to hunger.  Everything on the menu looked tempting but in the end we decided on ordering all apps.  I must declare that the homemade corn dogs were delicious!  My husband enjoyed the calamari and we both devoured one of the meat/cheese boards.  The beer was equally impressive and there was a wide selection to choose from to please just about anyone's palette.  I will absolutely stop by on our next Ohio trip.  It's a good place to just grab a beer, dinner or both!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place!   Went for an early dinner with friends before a CAVS game.  We had the best time trying different food items...and every thing we tried was wonderful.   The explanation was very helpful and portions perfect.   We will be there again soon!"}
{"text":"Really cool environment. Had to wait about 25 minutes before Cavs game. Ordered sliders, pretzels and mac and cheese along with one of their specials strip steak. Sliders and pretzels were very good. Mac and cheese come out cold, sent back and then my wife's steak showed up 15 minutes after the rest of us were finished.  Food was just average and as an out of Towner just not a place I would have to come back to!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this baby a review update and adding a star. It's Cleveland. And summer. And 90 degrees, but feels like 200 degrees. Cue Butcher and the Brewer: the only bar on East 4th Street today that had the air on. You walk in and immediately feel better, YESSSS. This gets 6 stars in my book. I have no idea why bars in CLE don't crank that air conditioning on days like today. There's honestly nothing worse than being with friends, on a date, or in a meeting and sweating like a Cavs player in the 4th quarter of a game.  Ok, but cool temperatures aside, every server and bartender I made eye contact with smiled at me tonight! That is awesome in itself. The service was fantastic despite being very busy. The beer and beer cocktails are excellent. I love Butcher and the Brewer for their cool decor, a great atmosphere, yummy food and nice beer selection. This place is a super easy pick for me when on East 4th Street!"}
{"text":"I had a really great experience here about two weeks ago. We had called ahead, but when we arrived someone else had claimed our table. The front desk team were on top of getting us a new table right away. The food was amazing, I had an Old Fashioned which was fantastic. I'll definitely be back when I visit Cleveland again."}
{"text":"We came here with a party of 10 ish for dinner/drinks before the Cavs game.  The husband and I have been several times in the past and have always enjoyed it.  The atmosphere is cool and fun and they have great beers and cocktails.  I had a couple of the stop hop kaboom ipa's and a gin-beer cocktail with the same beer in it.  The beer is awesome and the cocktail was pretty good too.  The husband had the beer and a couple of sangrias, which were good.  For the food, we all ordered a couple of things to share.  I tasted the black pepper tofu, mac n cheese, and the pierogi flatbread.  All were very good, but my favorite was the flat bread.  The tofu was quite tasty as well.  My only complaint about the evening was that we arrived around 5:30 and were told that it would be a 30 minute wait.  We were sat at 7:15, an hour and 45 minutes later.  I understand though because everyone was doing the same thing that we were, eating/drinking before the game and nobody wanted to leave until just before it started.  We had an amazing cocktail waitress while we were waiting.  The service when we sat was also fantastic and the kitchen got the food out very fast.  We were only a few minutes late for the game.  Overall, a very good experience."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is somehow both loud and classic with a early 1900s/industrial vibe, great food with lots of variety and creativity. Brews are between middling and amazing...haven't had anything not decent. My only complaint is the water tastes like mildew."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure the beer vats are old socks and water.   Every beer is awful.  And overpriced."}
{"text":"Ate there for the first time and was very impressed.  Fantastic food and exceptional beer.  Mac and cheese was delicious and highly recommended.  Also had sliders and beet salad."}
{"text":"If I was only rating the beer it would be 5 stars. Had a great flight and all the beers were awesome, the standout is the albino stout- it's magical. A light colored, vanilla flavored beer described to me as adult cream soda. But as I don't like cream soda, I think it tastes way better than that! I'm a sucker for gastro pub style food so I tried quite a few items. The good: the patatas bravas really are amazing, like all other yelpers seem to agree. So crispy on the outside, creamy on the inside, and they didn't need a protein added in my opinion, they rock on their own. I really loved the shishito peppers- that soy blue cheese sauce is addicting. Just make sure someone else at your table wants them too- there's a ton in a serving! The Mac and cheese is in the running for best world wide. The crispy pork shoulder was fantastic.  The not so good: bone marrow was all bone and no marrow. We sent one back and they replaced it, but an over eager busser cleared it before we ever got to try it. The tempura cauliflower was soggy and over battered, the broccoli rabe wasn't cooked enough and had an overwhelming smoke flavor. The chicken should have been amazing, but it was really dry. There were two other items we ordered and never got- one we got charged for but we did get it taken off.  The atmosphere is fun and the beer is so good I'll definitely be back to try more!"}
{"text":"Fantastic. Just fantastic, in Cleveland from out of town and this place did not disappoint. My pops and I started with the pretzel with a heavenly cheese sauce and don't get me started with the angus beef sliders. They also have there own brew house, with some really nice top shelf beers. Lets just put it this way our server Leslie knew her shit! Great food better service, I'll be back when I'm back in town. I would give it a 6/5 if I could."}
{"text":"Best restaurant bar on east 4th in Cleveland.  Great tapas style food and also large plates.  Prices are I but higher than normal bars but food is much better.  They don't take reservations but very good on seating."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing first time. The beer selection is delicious. My husband and I shared the oysters (briney and amazing), beef marrow (out of this world), the salted beets (refreshing & delicious), steak tartare (better than Bobby Flay's) and a cheese and meat board. Fern the hostess, to the bartender, to the server and the food runners everyone was friendly and helpful. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We had the Albino Stout, scallops, and BBQ pork shank. Totally blown away. Everything was perfectly cooked and so flavorful. Service was great. (I would recommend the albino stout even if you're a dark beer lover)"}
{"text":"Without a doubt, my favorite spot in downtown CLE.  The beer is fantastic. The food (the patatas bravas) are amazing. The atmosphere is so cool and the help is over the moon. I specifically go for their beer called Stop Hop Kaboom, an IPA they brew. It's probably one of my favorite beers here in CLE.   The bathrooms are really cool, although it's unfortunate when I'm a bit tipsy walking up and down those stairs. It's convenient for me to get to because I live downtown and work right across the street from East 4th Street.   All around, a must see here in Cleveland."}
{"text":"This is a great new bar on E. 4th with a huge selection of beers on tap, a huge space inside and a nice front patio. I came here one night and it was packed. The service was really good though and I loved the atmosphere. The only complaint I have is the joint bathrooms. I'm sure they thought this would be a different and creative concept but I'm not a fan. Men and women should not share a bathroom. Especially when the space is so big they could have easily made them separate. And especially when people are getting intoxicated lol.  However, I still loved this bar. I really liked the glasses that they served the beer in too. They have huge flat screens everywhere so It's a perfect spot to watch a game. I heard the food here is really good so I'll have to try it next time I stop in. I also like that it is in walking distance of so many places, a really great location!"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant twice-once with a group and once solo. Between both visits, I've tried the loaded kennebec fries (disappointing), bacon wrapped date (too much cheese, but that is probably a personal preference), roasted chicken (YUM), the breakfast flatbread (never had an egg on a pizza before but it was surprisingly good) and the crispy brussels sprouts (my favorite dish by far). On Thursday night I tried the special flatbread, which was house smoked pulled pork, red onion, arugula, and mozzarella cheese. By far the best meal I've had in Cleveland in a while.   I would highly recommend the crispy brussels sprouts and the flatbreads to anyone looking to eat here.   The only negative attribute is the noise level. There isn't any fabric around to absorb the noise, so it just echoes off all the walls. It creates a fun, loud atmosphere but it can be hard to have a conversation.   Regardless, I will definitely dine here again!"}
{"text":"On my second of two nights in town, stopped by this place for a quick-ish dinner. Sat at the bar, and had a pilsener as well as the shrimp and grits. Everything was great, and the portion was more than enough for a grown man. Service was prompt and friendly! With top, I was out for under $30, so no complaints on the value side either."}
{"text":"Went for date night. Our server Leslie was awesome, very attentive , she knew the drink and food menu very well. We tried the beets and goat cheese appetizer. Absolutely delicious. My man was in the mood for sliders, good choice. You only get 3 but you are able to add on extras for $5 each. Well worth it. The atmosphere is dark lighting, tv screens, relaxing. Would definitely go again.   The seating is several very long tables. You will be sitting with other people next to you unless you sit at the bar or they have individual barrel tables with stools to sit at. We sat at one of those. Would sit there again. Enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Micro brew pub in Cleveland ... nice! Had their house special stout with a twist of orange.... yum! Excellent service and came here for a work event. Excellent service, good 1 inch patty sliders, salty crab cakes, and Smoked wings.  Flatbread and crab cakes were cold during the catered event though."}
{"text":"I don't write reviews often but this place left an impression.   1. The walls and ceiling are concrete, trying to be hip. But it makes the restaurant SO LOUD. Everyone is screaming to their friends which makes it unbearable.   2. Two of our 5 drinks arrived late and with bugs floating in them. I kid you not!!  3. The entrees are overpriced and come with NO sides. Not even bread. LOL  4. Lastly two of us ordered one of the chicken dishes and they both tasted awfully like old fish. Putrid.   We will not be going back. That is all."}
{"text":"Found this on Yelp next to my hotel, (Residence Inn), and good reviews were spot on!  The 4 for $10 beer flight is worth the stop alone and ten stars for that and the wonderful service!!!  We tried every beer amongst the 5 of us and all got the thumbs up... Maybe my fave was the miel, (honey), but they're all good so it's hard to pick a fave. If you're just having snacks, I'd suggest the pretzels sticks to help with the alcohol... They're a good balance to a 9%APV!  And the beets were amazing.  The tempura cauliflower is perfectly cooked... No grease at all, no sogginess. Etc but probably needs a little flavor/kick? (I'd ask for a siracha type sauce on the side next time).. And the Mac was good too. Waitress was right there with the refills and tips... Really good at her job.  Coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Its a cool bar to hang out and have a drink or two. The food options are very limited but the food was good nonetheless. I tried one of their beers which they brew in-house, and the corpse reviver cocktail, neither was great but they were Ok I guess. For food both the beef sliders and charred broccolini were good."}
{"text":"The vibe was electric on E 4th before the Cavs Finals game #4, and the wait was only 45 minutes here so we gave it a whirl!  The food menu was smallish, but I settled on the pierogi flatbread (it was a tasty treat!) and broccolini (very good). My husband was unimpressed with the food menu, too, but very happy with the craft beer selection, and we'd go back just for that in the future."}
{"text":"Definitely the hot spot on his strip. I had the grilled chicken which was amazing and the charred broccolini was phenomenal."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Butcher and the Brewer for a looong time and finally had the chance! I called ahead for seating and they were able to accommodate 12 of us on Friday night! Awesome! I even called back 2 hours before and asked to change it to 14 of us and they had no problem.   Service was great. They paid a lot of attention to my big, crazy group and none of us went without an empty glass of beer the whole night. The meals are communal style. All of us just ordered what sounded good and shared. The corn dogs were amazing, we all loved them! My sister ordered the sausage flatbread and it came out burnt, but they sent a new one no problem. Some other samplings included the pierogi flatbread, beef sliders, Mac and cheese (really good, just a little salty), and the beets. It's a very interesting and cool place. The vibe and decor is pretty sweet. The bathrooms are awkward - they're communal. Kind of weird so be prepared.   We all had a lot of fun here, and if i needed a spot for a large group of people this would be high on my list!!"}
{"text":"Some great dishes... Some shouldn't have left the kitchen. Order the butchers board, stuffed branzino, steak tartar and the framboise. Steer clear of the calamari, smoked hocks, and the s'mores fondue"}
{"text":"Carb-heavy foodstuffs and fairly tame if v. tasty beers characterize Butcher + Brewer, E 4th Street's only microbrewery to speak of. The space is gigantic and mucho-mod industrial with very little to dampen the omnipresent shouts and guffaws and the creak of the myriad stools and the music: it can sometimes feel as though one has stepped into a cacophony chamber explicitly designed to overwhelm the eardrums. The service is quite good, particularly at the bar, however (the bartenders somehow supernaturally immune to the adversarial aural ambiance). Food flies from the kitchen: steamy, savory dirigibles of tempura cauliflower w/ curry aioli land hard and heavy, narcotizing diners not accustomed to such mega-rich vegetarian food. And let us not even mention the mythic Mac and Cheese--of which odes have very likely been written, before the scribe slowly succumbed to an eon-long food coma. Beer-wise, the albino stout is legendary, but the seasonal saison is a crisp crowd-pleaser in its own right, balancing vital funk with the clean grassy notes that epitomize high summer and aid one in escaping the winter doldrums, if only for a moment. Stop in some Friday night ready to munch and laugh--and do check out the basement brewery inset in its gleaming nook: strolling about the subteranean apparatuses gives one the impression of having jettisoned oneself from all things snow-smothered and grey and entered a futuristic inebriation machine where yeast dreams of electric phenolics and everyone is appreciated."}
{"text":"We went to the Cavs game and decided to head out after an awesome win. We are so happy we went here! The drinks were great and the food was out of this world! Our server, Kate, was awesome! I will definitely make sure we come back soon!"}
{"text":"After a long week of holidays with the family, my husband and I finally got away for a date night and wanted to try somewhere new to us in Cleveland. We arrived at Butcher and the Brewer for a late dinner around 10pm. It was bitter cold out, but we were lucky to score some parking right around the corner. While I wouldn't say it was crowded, there were definitely other people out and about. We were seated right away at an empty community style table, which was fine by us. I love the industrial interior, high ceilings, and warehouse feel.  We were pretty hungry and were going off the menu recommendations of 2-3 items per person, so we picked out six things. When it came time to order, the server was like, hold up--that is waaayyy too much food, which was very nice of her. We were eventually able to narrow things down, but everything on the menu looked good! Since everything is served small plate style, they bring out things as they are ready.   We had the kale Caesar, which had the best crunchy, garlicky croutons and unique purple hard-boiled eggs. Next up were the Josper roasted mussels, which came in the most delicious broth with bleu cheese and bacon--I mean, how can you go wrong with that combo?! Then, we ordered the pork chop taco special. I'm drooling just thinking about those tacos now! The pork chop was perfectly charred in their woodstone oven and served with smoky barbecue sauce and the tastiest slaw on homemade tortillas. The combination of everything was out of this world!  My husband and I were beyond impressed by our meal at Butcher and the Brewer, and next time we're in town, we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner. Honestly I would not go back again. The food was good (nothing special) but the prices kinda high and the portions small. You have to order at least 3-4 items from seafood, meat, veggies, and apps to come close to feeling full. And don't forget the beer. And that's only for 2 people."}
{"text":"Delicious brown ale beer, we ended up getting a growler to take home. The meat and cheese plate is very good, very fresh. I also got the steak tartar which was fabulous. Seasoned perfectly. Cute vibe, definitely gets busy after Cavs games."}
{"text":"Food & drinks were amazing. Ordered three tapas style meals & each one has an incredible flavors & tastes. Had the farmhouse draft beer, which was great to pair."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Stopped in for a drink after dinner and the bartender was hilarious. Not sure about the food here, but the bartender did let me and my boyfriend just keep our specialty glasses after we asked to buy them...so that's a plus for me!"}
{"text":"What can I say that other Yelpers haven't already!  I was in town with a couple of co-workers and found this amazing place on Yelp.  A big old factory type building with a brewery and fantastic food.  The menu is tapas style, with small plates.  Great for sharing.  And service was absolutely excellent from our server Rebecca!  See pic!  .    The beers were superb, especially the Galaxy.  A flavorful IPA.  Do yourself a favor and check this one out.   Now on to the food.  The Patatas Bravas, A+. The calamari, A+.  The Diver Scallops, A++.  The smoked lamb ribs, A+++.    This would be my go to downtown restaurant if I only lived here.   Maybe they'll put one in Grand Rapids someday.    Do yourself a favor and check this place out.  You'll be a hero to your group!"}
{"text":"Let me first say, the beer is delicious.... however, I'm not sure why they call it the \"butcher\".  They do not even serve a burger or steak.  Very let down.  They do have a huge vegan section on their menu, which would be awesome if they were called the \"Gardner and the Brewer\"."}
{"text":"Have been a couple of times.  The food is always delicious!  I especially love the mac & cheese.  The only thing I'm not crazy about is the bar so close to the seating area, and the bar tends to overflow.  Other than that, great experience."}
{"text":"Fairly new spot to the city. Lot's of room, but usually busy and packed at all times. Good spot for apps and to watch sporting events. Known for their meats and beer, cocktails are OK. My only complaint is that I had ordered the slides once and they were completely raw. The waitress said \"that is how they are supposed to be and they are cooked on a flat top\". I am ok with rare meat, but this was raw. She was unwilling to accept that or offer to do anything about it, even just cook the ones I had more. Unfortunately that ruined my experience once and am always hesitant to want to go back given the many other places in the city now."}
{"text":"It's good. Good atmosphere. Good beers. Good snacks. Interesting restrooms. Will be back"}
{"text":"Sliders were a 6/10 but the potato appetizer was excellent. The menu is fun and versatile and the service was decent. Would definitely recommend if eating late in the evening! Also, wonderful drinks!! I would suggest the beer cocktails."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here before an Indians game this week and it was amazing! Every dish we ordered was delicious! The raspberry wheat beer was so good I regret not getting a growler! The calamari was so tasty! The only thing I didn't like was the seating. I dislike cafeteria style seating and the annoying lady next to us with her purse practically on my plate didn't help."}
{"text":"Food=unreal.  Service=terrible.  Will definitely come back for the bone marrow tho."}
{"text":"A little pricey if you go there hungry but well worth it in my book, the food is amazing - scallops, pork shoulder, and bone marrow are my go to.  Obviously the beer is amazing highly recommend a flight for first timers because you must try them all!  The staff is always super helpful and quick especially last time Alyssa had the best recommendations!   Will continue to go for both lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Oh man. Food was so good. We had the charred broccolini, smoked whole wings, and the meat and cheese plate with the cheddar.  Probably the best food I've had in a long time.  Beer is excellent also. We had the Saison, session ipa, and farmhouse ipa.  Steel some Jalepeno Jelly from their deli and smuggle back home. It's got crack cocain in it! So good!"}
{"text":"Leslie and Tessa our servers were amazing! Each dish ordered topped the next. My husband and I are going out to dinner tomorrow with his coworkers, this is where we are suggesting. Awesome food, perfect portions, great service!"}
{"text":"We went here after a game night, their service was prompt and their food quality was really good. My friend had the bacon and egg something, and that was really good. The only complaint I would have is that, I ordered the tofu meal, which was delicious, but it needed a side of rice or something to go with it, it felt like a tofu entree and was too spicy just by itself. I would definitely be returning to this place to try out their other food options."}
{"text":"Went there in the evening during a business trip. Superb Brews and excellent service. Our server \"Mark\" was very attentive and spot on with his beer recommendations. I am a \"Just give me a beer guy\", but the Albino stout was wonderful. The food was also very good with the sharing of Beets, Broccoli, and Cauliflower a wise choice. My Entree , the Scallops, was also very good. My only complaint is there should be more food. If in town check this out. Something for everyone here."}
{"text":"Went with a party of six the other night and wasn't sure what to expect based on the mixed reviews.  They do not serve individual meals but rather small to medium plates meant for sharing.  I was very nervous about how this would work as we have very adventurous eaters in our group down to a pregnant picky eater.  Our water recommended 2 selections per person.  This ended up being a bit to much food.  The ratio of 1.5 per person would be better.  The food comes out as its ready,not all at once.  Be prepared in advance to share food. We ordered: oysters on the half shell with the siracha lime dressing ( some of our parties first experience-success), a meat and cheese board (jellies were weird-wouldn't order again), chicken wings, roasted chicken, lobster roll, sliders, macaroni and cheese, green beans, steak tartare ( skip), a breakfast dish, mussels and calamari. For the most part our entire table enjoyed all of the food and was very happy.  The rings were perhaps the biggest hit ( they are a little spicy and smokey)  resulting in one member of our party declaring we must perfect our smoking technique in order to do wings like that at home.  The green beans were also a big hit, which is shocking because we were not that excited about ordering beans. Overall we had a great time but it was in part because we were willing to share, work together on a menu selection and have fun. Go with an open mind, good group and you will not be disappointed.  There was some confusion with the beer flights ordered but our waiter (who was excellent) quickly corrected."}
{"text":"We held welcome Drinks for our wedding here. It was fantastic. We had the whole bottom floor to ourselves  It was easy to get everything set up and the entire event was customizable. Just tell them what you want and they'll make it happen.   The food and drink were fantastic and the ambiance was great.   But what stood out above all else was the flexibility during the event. We got about 40 more people than anticipated and the staff just rolled with it and keep the food and drink coming. Also, when we wanted to extend the time of the event by 1.5 hours it was no problem.   I'd recommend this as a venue for any type of gathering.   Best of all - everything came at an affordable price."}
{"text":"Butcher & The Brewer is always one of my go to bars when I visit east 4th and the downtown area. I'm a huge fan of their \"Stop Hop Kaboom\" IPA, but have never tried a beer there that I didn't like.        Recently, my boyfriend and I visited before a show at hilarities, which is right next door. I had an offer for a free charcuterie board with the purchase of a beer flight, so we decided it was a good excuse to try some different beers. The flight comes with four samples, so we ordered the simplicity pilz, positively east 4th IPA, bravo session IPA, and the repeater kolsch. Of the four, I particularly enjoyed the positively east 4th, though all were very tasty. I believe the flight was $10.       The charcuterie board came with three different meats, which were all good. We didn't really know what to expect with this, but I do wish we had had some bread or cheese to go along with it.       For our meal, we both shared the sausage flatbread and the mac and cheese. With the charcuterie board and beer, we definitely overestimated how much we could eat! The flatbread is a decent size and was extremely tasty. The mac and cheese, however, was the star of the show. It was so cheesy and definitely the best mac and cheese I have ever had!       Overall, we had a great experience with service, food, and drinks. We definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"From Chicago and tried this spot out twice. Our first time was on Monday for my birthday celebration and I love how they have a tapas style type of service. I usually don't finish my meals especially while drinking beer so it was a good medium. Justin was our server and he was so kind and gave great information as soon as we answered telling him it was our first time. The food was great - especially the bacon and egg. So much so that after our hike on our last day in Ohio, my friend wanted to go back to specifically get that before we hit the road back to Chicago. We checked out more of Cleveland while we waited until they opened. Rebecca was our server this time and oh my goodness, what a patient sweetheart. I'm a server and I would've rolled my eyes internally so hard for how indecisive we were about beer. Even if she was annoyed, she was so sweet through out the whole thing. Gave my friend a handful of beer sips and finally settled on the last one. She was so great at suggesting so many things to him. She even came back and talked with us about some things about Cleveland and talked about Chicago with us while we were waiting for our food. We had to rush out so that we got home at a reasonable time (and Chicago traffic is horrible) and she was really great about getting us out.   The food was wonderful but it's also such a great plus to have servers like Justin and Rebecca. Made us feel comfortable and didn't leave us hanging to fend for ourselves with our first time in Cleveland and the knowledge about the place and their food/beer. Highly suggest the broccolini if you need a veggie to even out the beautiful guilt you feel after eating the bacon and egg."}
{"text":"Came here for pre-dinner drinks and appetizers for my girlfriends birthday. Excellent brew and food. We sat at the bar. Came just a bit before open time. It was raining outside. The host let us in even though they weren't ready and nicely informed us we could take our seats at the bar and hang out until then. Was very nice and thoughtful. Some places don't look at things like that. Had a great time and will be back for sure to experience dinner."}
{"text":"Great drinks, delicious food, and great service. Be willing to spend and extra buck or two, but well worth it. The food is like an art here! And the service is friendly and very quick. If you are in the area stop in and ask for Tessa or Kristen! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Literally everything on the menu is FANTASTIC!!! The sliders, flatbreads, pork rillettes, the cheese plate (St angel Brie and fig preserve Prairie breeze) al of it....absolutely amazing! The corn dogs were not worth eating but seriously all of the food was awesome!!!"}
{"text":"2 stars only because it was a poor choice restaurant for a vegetarian. However, the Mac & Cheese was delicious. The ambiance of the place was nice, very 'hipster'. My thought was that their menu was overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"All of their food is excellent. The chorizo tacos, corn dogs, soft pretzels and mac'n'cheese are must haves. The service is usually very good but it gets so loud when it is busy, which it seems to always be very busy when I come in."}
{"text":"Stopped in before Indians game on Saturday and couldn't have been happier.   Great service from the staff, everything was quick and delicious.   Drinks were all made well and as expected.    The Steak Sliders were the best thing and one my favorite dishes in Cleveland now, definitely something I would recommend to anyone trying for a first time.   Don't forget to call ahead or you will be waiting for a seat or crammed between people at a communal table."}
{"text":"Drinks Only: Great beers, except they were out of 2 on a Monday night. I don't think they have a soft drink gun, so if you ask for a tall cocktail, the glasses only fill up to about two inches or so below the rim, because they are using a can of soda-would recommend trying their beers over liquor anyways. Our female bartender wasn't very friendly, but overall good ambiance and perfect place to grab a drink before going out to dinner on East 4th."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a meal and a cocktail with little time to spare before I needed to get to the airport and on my way back to Chicago. The recommendations given to me you were exactly as portrayed. Great beer on tap and even better food on the menu. Very impressed and pleased with the quality of service the staff and location has to offer. Definitely will be back if I'm ever in Cleveland anytime soon."}
{"text":"Had a great time last night, great atmosphere, good beer The location on 4th st. Downtown is a plus"}
{"text":"We checked this place out on a Thursday night and were seated immediately, although the place definitely wasn't empty. The rustic brewery vibe is inviting, and everything we ate here was just YUM! Starting with the beers... my favorites were the Farmer's Daughter saison and the Saison D'Ete raspberry saison. But everything I tried in my flight was very good! My husband loved the Cle Pils.   For the food... we tried the house-smoked corndogs, which were super delish! The mustard aioli served on the side was a great accompaniment. The smoked lamb ribs were out, unfortunately, but we tried the smoked cheddar sausage instead as a recommendation from our server. This was a GREAT recommendation! I am generally not a sausage person, but this was the best sausage I have ever had. The josper oven really is a miracle-worker! Such yummy charred flavors!! We then tried the scallops which tasted fresh and delicious. The celery root puree served with them was phenomenal - I was basically licking the plate! Next was charred broccolini. This was a little too intensely flavored for me - the feta and red wine vinaigrette combo was pretty powerful. But still good, just in moderation. And then ending with a brownie/cake-type thing with caramel ice cream and a super yummy caramel plop on the side (yes, the caramel plop looked like an emoji poop, but it was one of the shining stars of the whole meal!).  I would definitely check this place out again next time I'm in Cleveland and maybe get a shirt because the logo is legit!"}
{"text":"This place was fantastic! So glad that it's tapas-style, otherwise you'd sincerely regret missing out on some great food items. The pork shank with kimchi, appetizer sliders and charred broccolini were delicious!"}
{"text":"I almost didn't go here because of the reviews but man am I glad I did!  The Albino stout was nothing I had ever had before. I love a good stout/porter and this one was awesome!  It went down a little too easy!  I also ordered the Patatas Bravas and bacon wrapped dates. The dates were okay, I didn't love the schmear but I also ate all of them. The Patatas bravos were DELICIOUS!!   I sat at the bar since I was in town for work. Staff was very friendly and had great recommendations   I really enjoyed my visit and I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"I got the shishito peppers and the crispy pork shank.  Both were excellent.  The pork shank is definitely very crispy.  It comes with kimchi, naan, and buttermilk dressing.  It's almost like another take on Peking duck.  Delicious.  Jamie was my server and she was totally on the ball and also very warm and friendly.  She welcomed me as an out of towner and made good beer and food suggestions.  Service was perfect.  The bathroom is a community bathroom with stalls.  But the stalls are still marked M and W, which honestly kinda pissed me off.  Come on people, a stall is a stall.  There is no difference.  Please welcome all genders.  Also, the water taps tended to spray, though they did make for a nice effect.  And then there was the Dyson hand dryer hiding in the corner seeming very out of place.  Ok I think that's enough on the bathroom.  The place is quite large and very loud, like very loud.  At least it's very loud on a Friday night at 10pm.  It's possible that earlier would've been a little quieter and more manageable for a date.  Overall great food, beer, and service.  Bathroom need a little work, and it's potentially too loud for a date.  Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Interesting ambience... At first i thought it was pretentious, but it definitely grew on me, especially HDTV in black and white.  Staff was super nice. Had this terribly disgusting incident when my skirt got stuck on wet gum below the table.  Waitress and management were super awesome about it...service really is key!! Food was on the pricey side for portion size, but well made.  The lamb and branzino were my fave's. Would def come back!"}
{"text":"Great location, ambiance (relaxed and industrial), and FOOD!! The only thing that was a little off putting was they do communal seating so don't go there to have a serious private conversation. We had the beets with goat cheese (amazing!), the sliders (really, really good!), calamari (good!) and one other thing that I can't remember. The drinks were really good as well. Definitely a cool place to go!!"}
{"text":"The sliders are off the hook. The nitro beer is great.  The private events are great to host customers."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar to watch the Indian's game. Great selection of beers, great service, can't wait to come back and try the food"}
{"text":"I finally got to eat here, and I was pretty impressed with the food! I was here for an early dinner on a Saturday night (around 5:30 is when it started filling up, and yeah... it got loud!).  My friend got the albino stout, and LOVED it. Our server was really nice and explained the concept well. Breakfast flatbread: really tasty. the bacon was delicious. Not the most amazing flatbread I've ever had, but solid. Divers Scallops: I thought they were perfectly cooked with a nice crispy sear, and I liked the puree that they came with. Crispy pork shank: holy bbq, batman. This was delicious. The pork fell right off the bone, and it had a really amazing crisp on the outside (it seemed lightly breaded and fried)- and you carve the pork and put it on little flatbreads with coleslaw, bbq sauce, and beans. I was just in TX this week, and this was better than the bbq i had there. Seriously.  Steak Tartare: my friend liked it, and ate it all... honestly, this is not really my thing. ;) Like others have said, this place does seem a bit pricey, especially considering they are going for tapas sizes (though I thought the portions were more generous than tapas). But, considering the quality of ingredients, I think it's worth a splurge once in a while! The place looks really cool- definitely a hip atmosphere. I just wish it were a little quieter... but overall, we had a pretty great experience."}
{"text":"Although I have not yet eaten here, I have gone here numerous times for drinks, specifically the beer!!  First of all the location is great.  Located in the heart of downtown Cleveland on East 4th Street makes is very easy accessible before or after sporting events or concerts.  However there is little to no parking close to the restaurant.  If you are driving here plan on parking in garage or dishing out the extra money for valet, otherwise you will have to park a few blocks away at a meter.    I really like the decor inside.  It is somewhat rustic with a lot of different wood based tones used in the tables and long bar area.  There are numerous large flat screen TVs at the bar area so you can easily watch any sporting event from anywhere in the upper level of the restaurant.  Every time I have been, I have gotten the albino stout and it was delicious.  There are small high top tables in the bar area to hang out around and set your beer or appetizers on.  Another cool concept were the restrooms.  They are almost like community style bathrooms.  The men and women's stalls are in the same large room and divided by the large sinks that are made of bath tubs.  This place tends to get VERY crowded on weekends and before and after sporting events so plan accordingly.  I love that downtown Cleveland now has its own micro brewery right in the city and can serve great beer and food to all!"}
{"text":"Good menu with tasty food.¬† We got several things to share and had way too much food.¬† Good beer selection, and the cocktails looked great as well.¬† Cool atmosphere and ambiance, a little loud to hear others in the group because of the high ceilings and it was packed with people, but great spot otherwise.¬†   Everything we tried was great, and all of the other food that went by looked just as good.¬† Really recommend the fried potatoes appetizer, it was out of this world, but the other things were really delicious as well.¬† Service was great but drinks seemed to take a long time.¬† Nevertheless, I would definitely come back here to try more of the awesome menu."}
{"text":"Really hot spot on Saturday nights. Great craft beer menu and I had a really cool cocktail. Crown royal mule on special. Absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible customer service. Called the day before asking if they took reservations and was told that they didn't (not that they were full, that they didn't take reservations). Decided to walk in the following day. We were told it was going to be an hour wait but since we were decided on it, we walked around until our hour was up. When we went back over an hour later, we were told by the hostess that our wait was still an hour... The craziest part about it was that there were at least 5 tables empty. We were told they were be saved for reservations despite being told the day before that they didn't take reservations. We waited an additional 20 minutes as more tables opened up but they never sat us and gave us no additional information. We ended up leaving with an hour and a half of our lives wasted. Very disappointing as I had been there before for a drink which was good and frequently visit the Tremont taphouse which is owned by the same people."}
{"text":"Great food and amazing food. Came across this place by accident, but it will be my go to place when I go to cleveland.  Top notch beers, you can tell they have a great brew team. Had the Roasted Chicken, was delicious.   Staff was very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places... It was the first place my husband and I checked out when we moved to town, and we keep coming back. It's perfection because the variety of food and the fact that we can do tapas style dining (which is my all-time favorite way to eat), but there are some larger portions and heartier dishes, so my husband doesn't leave feeling hungry.  Soooo tasty, and there are plenty of options, that even the pickiest eater can find yummy options... Super cool and fun atmosphere and decor, and really friendly service.  This place is perfect for just about anybody, except somebody who is sensitive to noise, or has difficulty hearing in public. The building, decor, and music make for a pretty loud environment, so if you're looking for quiet, or a place to take your grandparents, it's probably not the best choice. Otherwise, if you don't mind a bit more energry and noise- make sure you try the chicken wings, sliders, and corn dogs, oh and if you like chorizo- patatas with chorizo."}
{"text":"About 10 of us from ESPN's Sunday Night Baseball crew came here for dinner on Saturday night and it was unbelievable. Drinks were great, food was awesome. We ordered so much food and every plate was great. Before dinner we got a tour from Keith and it very informative and very cool to be told the whole process of how they make their beer. Definitely coming back whenever we are back in Cleveland. Thanks Keith!"}
{"text":"A bit on the pricey side for what you get.  Small portions, I would not go there with a bunch of hungry guys unless you wanted to sample a lot and spend a lot.  Crispy pork shank was probably the best, but I didn't think the kimchi that came with it was that good.  Guys I was with had a pierogi flatbread (good, but small), and lamb ribs, very small portion, and nothing much with them.  Calamari appetizer was interesting, but not enough of the oil on the bottom of the plate to dip it in.  The corn dog appetizer too, was OK but not inspiring.  Service was lackluster, and the food came out in dribs and drabs.   Beer is great.  There's a lot of options at East 4th street, I will be trying some of those before i'm back here, though if you want beer mainly, this is great."}
{"text":"It's a butcher shop and a brewery!!!! The beer was awesome the bartenders were on point. They handed the wrestling crowd like pros!!!!! I have seen some bartenders fold under the pressure of large crowds and stressful situations. But, this crew was awesome!!!!! The gods was excellent!!! I wasn't sure about shareable foods, but that Pork shank was unbelievable good!!!! If you are in the mood for good food and great craft beer, this is a must stop and consume."}
{"text":"The white albino stout...WOW. Could easily be the best beer I have ever had. I'm upset I live so far away and I was only able to enjoy if for one night."}
{"text":"I received a response from the owner of Butcher and the Brewer after I wrote my review.  He apologized for our experience and asked that we give them another chance.  Well, it took a few years for us to get back to Cleveland, but we sure enough came back - the very night of our arrival even.    It was later in the evening on a Friday.  Seating was a little chaotic, but not impossible by any means, and the hostess on duty was nice.  Our server was super busy, but came right back to us as soon as she could.  Overall good service.  The food and beer was great.  So glad to know that all of those good smells had a worthwhile payoff at the end :).  Glad that we gave this place another shot.  We'll be back again...eventually!!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! Great beer great food awesome atmosphere!! Ask for John the bar tender he was great and had some great  Recommendations. love this brewery as a pro brewer I highly recommend trying them out! Trevor Luther  Grove city brewing company"}
{"text":"Food is good, drink selection is great, but it is absolutely asinine that these fantastic HD TVs are shown in black and white only.    Asked a few servers why they don't show in color, and the most thorough answer was \"well we noticed when we show in color, that people at the bar weren't talking to each other.\"  Um...it's probably because they are doing what people do at bars, watch the game."}
{"text":"In town for a football game and came in on a Saturday night for dinner. There was an hour wait for a table but lucked out on a first come high top. Was skeptical when I saw that most of the menu is meant to be shared but the portions were huge! Sliders were great! Friend got the smoked sausage which looked amazing and the two beers I had were awesome too. Waitress was over worked and we waited about 15 min for service after we sat which is the only reason for not giving 5 stars. Great place overall!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner for 2 on a busy Saturday night. The wait was estimated around 45 min but we got in much sooner. Compared to other restaurants around East 4th on a busy Saturday this wasn't too bad.   I'll start on with drinks: I tried a flight of each type of their beers. I can't remember exactly all of them but the 2 that stood out to me were an IPA with a semi sweet & sour crushed cherry taste, & another which was an albino Stout with chocolate & coffee aromas. These were 2 very unique brews I hadn't tasted anything like before & were fun to sip. The pours were pretty generous for a flight, maybe around 5-6oz. and served on a cool flight platter with a handle.   For food we enjoyed the sliders, mac & cheese w/ bacon, lamb ribs, & broccolini. All dishes were out of this world delicious and served to share family style. The smoked meats, slider buns, & hearty mac & cheese were fantastic & complimented the beer very well. However, dishes were fairly expensive considering you only got 3 sliders & 4 ribs each for around $15, but I suppose you pay for the quality & atmosphere of downtown on a Saturday. The mac & cheese and broccoli I dish were a bit more plentiful for 2 people to share. Overall the bill was around $75 but I did walk away not quite as full of the good stuff as I had hoped.   Had a great experience & fun time watching the Cavs game that night. The basement was cool & bathrooms \"unique\" I would say with men's & women's rooms sharing a sink.  Next time I would probably go with a group of 4-6 to better take advantage of the shared plates."}
{"text":"hmmmm, I've saved this place as my second to last review of the day because I had to put some thought in to this one. Still not even sure where I stand.   Well at I guess at this point, I stand at 3 stars.    Name of the place is super cool. That alone has to bring in some biz.  Reading the reviews, obviously this is a go-to spot in d-town Cleve.   But for me, it just wouldn't be.      We got there right at opening so seating was no issue. I was concerned that getting there right as they were opening, the staff would not be prepared. I was wrong. They were ready for business. And business they do receive.  We blinked and the place was full.  That has to say something about this spot, right?      Hubs ordered the wings (VERY unique!) and I got the mushroom flat bread. We were both \"satisfied\" with our food. Not thrilled. Not over the moon. Just ok. For the price, I wanted more flavor.  As far as the flat bread, lower the price by $2 bucks and it's spot on worth it.       Beer selection good- very typical of Cleveland. Wine pours are small.   End of the meal time, ready to leave. But let's hit the bathroom first.  If you do anything here at Butcher and The Brewer, you should go to the bathroom!!!  I won't expand why......just do it."}
{"text":"Cool place, but HORRIBLE service. We were yelled at by a bus boy three times for sitting in a chair that no one was using. One of us had a bad back and literally sat for two seconds before he said \"these chairs are not for sitting\" and simply moved it 5 feet away from us. So rude and so ridiculous. Won't go back again. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Excellent small plates, shared 9 for 5 people and it was the perfect amount. Pork shank is to die for as is the macaroni and cheese."}
{"text":"Just had an amazing dinner at the bar....John was spectacular!!  Great recommendations and great service!  The food was amazing (sliders, corn dogs and the perogi pizza).  The drinks were perfect and arrived just in time.   Absolutely one of the best spots in town!   This is definitely on my list of places that I would visit with guests from out of town."}
{"text":"Parking is almost unheard of here, so be ready to vallet (&13), uber or walk! This is an enormous place, with plenty of seating inside and outside. Their eclectic menu touches base on American style dishes and seafood alike. I love coming here for games, or just to eat."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints!  One word - AMAZING!!  Pickled Brussels - would've never tried them and now we want to make them! This is worth the trip and worth the wait.  Wait staff is fabulous, beers fabulous, meats and cheeses unlike anything you get anywhere else.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Negative stars. Food wasn't anything better than a frozen dinner. Scream like you're at concert if you want to be heard."}
{"text":"This place was the home of our best bite in Cleveland. Hands down. The ambiance is great. Fun atmosphere, inventive and different foods, served family style in small portions. The bone marrow was outstanding and the selection for their charcuterie plate was awesome. Also, what a pleasant surprise to be served a proper gimlet. Delicious all around!!!"}
{"text":"Neat place to eat if you haven't tried it. The room is very loud. Arnold Palmer was not so good. The food is great and this place is a nice twist for dinner if you're into sharing. I'm not a fan of sharing dinner unless it's my wife. So I gave a four due to that and noise level but will definitely be back. Try the wings, pork shank and the lobster roll."}
{"text":"I was disappointed. The tables are awkward and we were placed at a long table next to around 8 other people at the table. The plates were meant for sharing as well. We ordered several different items as instructed, such as sliders and calamari. Nothing was really that good. It was also expensive."}
{"text":"Beer was excellent, atmosphere was great but $15 for 4 bones of lamb rib? Are you kidding me? We also got the pierogi flatbread and it was very underwhelming, also a small portion and barely hot for $12.   The waiter suggested that most people order 3-4 items for two people. Sorry, but I was not spending close to $75 on mediocre food."}
{"text":"After a second visit to the Butcher & The Brewer, I am drafting my review. I stopped in both times with the wife for drinks, but we have yet to consume a meal here.  We did, however, eat an appetizer on our first visit. We had bacon wrapped dates and they were delicious.   This place is really large - so large in fact, that they don't even use all the space. The basement contains the brewery, private tables for groups, and the bathrooms.   Speaking of bathrooms, men and women share one large bathroom. The women's and men's stalls face each other. And you have to either knock or just push your way in to see if the stall is occupied because the stall doors go all the way to the floor.  So when a woman sits down to pee (or worse) and forgets to lock the door, everyone waiting for a stall is eligible for a free peep show!  Hey, I never complained about dinner AND a show. I watched a woman open two stall doors before quickly and embarrassingly apologizing to two startled, urinating occupants who forgot to lock their doors. The men made no such mistake.  All men's stall doors were locked when they were occupied. Live and learn ladies, unless you're a voyeur, of course!  Otherwise, the beer and service were good and we will probably be back for a meal some day."}
{"text":"Chris did an excellent job great food fast friendly and knowledgeable service.  New how to direct new people to beers that would suite their taste buds."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food. Everything was top notch. Mushroom flat bread was to die for. Also had the sliders which were also very good."}
{"text":"We were in Cleveland for a convention and we ate there two nights in a row, our last two nights.  The service was outstanding and the food was awesome. We had the eggs and bacon flatbread, the pork shank, sausage flatbread, chicken with cheddar sausage, and the sausage with potatoes.  All I can say is WOW WOW WOW. Wish this was in the Chicago suburbs.  High quality meats!   Just an incredible experience!  And the street that it was on was so cool.   Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We sat at the bar. The bartenders were really nice and fast even though the place was packed. They suggested us to try some great beers. The food was OK.  The menus need to include more healthy choices. I would give this place a 4.5 * but can't."}
{"text":"Four stars on the food, three on the environment. Overall, 3.5 stars.  So, I really liked the Butcher & the Brewer. It reminded me a lot of a restaurant I went to in DC- the un-private long tables, the black and white screens, the after work social environment. interesting.  We were seated right away on a Thursday night , at the end of a very long table. However, it was loud. Like, really loud. Like, I had to yell over the table to be heard- and for a girl with a quiet voice, I was nearly hoarse at the end of the night. The couple that was sitting next to us, sadly looked like they were on their first date. The poor guy yelled \"sorry, I didn't realize this place would be so loud, probably not a good place for a date\", and the girl didn't say anything. Well, rest alone, by the end of the night, they were NOT talking to each other and just staring at their cell phones. #firstdatefail  Anyways, we got a superb server, and I was extremely impressed on how good the service was. Our server knew the menu inside and out, and was great to talk to. The servers were on the ball- greeting each party, getting the food in and out quite speedily, to even snatching up the plates once you were done. Impressed.   We ordered a variety of dishes- perhaps not the healthiest (our server had asked us, \"so....any vegetables?\" which we were like, \"eh...nah, we're fine.\" he he he): - Bone Marrow- great flavor, however, just a tad too oily for us. But great flavor. - Loaded Kennebec Fries- YUM. Loved the flavorful pork belly in it (good amount), and the egg on top is key. This was actually pretty heavy- and I really liked them. - Smoked Lamb Ribs- wow, definitely very good. And a lot bigger than we thought it would be. Def recommend the lamb!  Overall, I thought the food was great, and so flavorful. That's all I can say- their food is VERY flavorful. The microbrew list is great too. However, it was just way too LOUD. If I had a low and loud voice it would be different...just way too loud. But if you're just interested in the food and not looking for a quiet date- definitely check this place out, I recommend it!"}
{"text":"I have no idea why the low rating . This place was awesome. We came with a huge group and they were friendly and accommodating. The home brews are delicious and varied. The food is spectacular for pub food. You must get the patas bravas the fried chicken and the corn dogs. So perfect pre game!!!! Big fan of this place we will be back"}
{"text":"We made a \"reservation\" on Tuesday for 8pm Friday night, and then called again Friday to confirm and we sat and waited till 9pm and still were not seated, so we left. Worst customer service experience at a restaurant, the hostess were like doormen stopping and questioning and giving dirty looks to people. And when we asked about when we would be seated they told us our table was being bussed, 20 minutes later we were still not seated.  After we told them of our dissatisfaction and told them that we were leaving, the manager did not offer us anything or try to accommodate us what so ever."}
{"text":"We had a terrific dinner here prior to a Cavs game.  Great local beers and fun atmosphere.  Recommend the sliders, lobster roll, and pork shank.  Noise level is a little loud - but found it fun and festive."}
{"text":"I am in Cleveland for business most weeks and know the downtown restaurants pretty well. Many are very good, however the Butcher and the Brewer is my favorite. The food is awesome !  I just had the pork shank.  Out of this world good!  I highly recommend it"}
{"text":"Seating was not conducive to party of 2. We were sat at a long pub height table and inundated with a huge crowd after specifically asking if it would be overwhelmed ."}
{"text":"Fun place for a brew and bar food! They Bree their own beer and have some great small plates. I was out with a client and coworker. We got the bacon wrapped dates, smoked wings and sliders. All were great! Their IPA beer, which I had was good stuff too."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this bar. Atmosphere was large and dark and fun. The bathroom is in the basement and very interesting. Place was packed and our service was amazing. Justin really knew his stuff and kept us entertained and well stocked the whole time we were there.  I got a sampler of 4 beers and 3/4 were amazing. I highly recommend the Albino Stout and the Spice Spice Baby. They were both unlike any beer I have ever tried. Stout was very oaty with amazing hints of coffee and chocolate. Spice tasted like Christmas but without being overwhelming or having a sharp finish.  We ordered a meat and cheese plate. I loved the smoked duck ham and the Gouda with some blueberry jam and honey mustard. The pheasant was really good too. Would love to go back and try more of their menu. It all sounded delicious!"}
{"text":"My husband and I wish there was a Butcher & The Brewer in Seattle where we live with their tasty, innovative menu! We tried the chorizo taco with goat cheese, burger, pork shank, brussel sprouts (best brussel sprouts I have ever tasted), and the cauliflower .  Everything was top notch, but if we had to pick a favorite, it would be the pork shank.  It was so tender that the meat just fell off the bone.  It came with 4 flat breads, brussel sprout slaw, cranberry sauce, and buttermilk sauce.  When you put it all together in a sandwhich the combination of flavors was divine!  Also, I am not normally a beer person, but their albino stout was delicious."}
{"text":"This is a great establishment. Well made beer, great food to pair with it, and excellent service. Shoutout to Carl who swung by often and made sure we had everything we want. Cheers"}
{"text":"Brewery Pub! I was so excited to have some beers at Butcher & The Brewer.  Walked in and the hostess advice me that all their terminals are down and they not sure when it would be back up running. I just want some beers and can pay cash for them. But apparently they cannot take even drink orders when the terminals are not working.  She suggested I come back tomorrow... and it was just 6 pm in the evening?!"}
{"text":"Really loved this place - so much so, we visited twice on a recent trip to Cleveland. The service is friendly and food is very good; however, the wings are mind-blowing...best I've ever had!! Just the right amount of spice and meaty so you don't feel like you're over-worked for a little nugget of meat.  Location is right on W4th street so very convenient to the sporting arenas. Plenty of TVs for watching any type of sports. Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday for early-ish dinner and shared several tapas/small plates. I really liked the stuffed dates, warm pimento cheese dip that came with our soft pretzels and the mac and cheese - definitely recommend those. The patatas bravas were too burnt and came with hardly any aioli - I had to ask for extra. Tried a bit of the cauliflower tempura - pretty good.   For drinks I skipped the beer and had a fall sangria - very delicious but should've had that for pre-dinner cocktail and then just have wine with meal because the flavors of cider and spice-laden sangria overpowered food at times.    Overall I liked it here, the space was large, plenty of room at communal table, waitress was very nice."}
{"text":"I can't really give this place a full review because I have not tried their deli side yet and I hear its very good. We went there before a monsters game and there was quite a crowd for a place that didn't have a happy hour. We ordered the albino stout which was quite good and a few other beers which were delicious as well. We decided to order some appetizers instead of a full on entree and had mixed reviews. First off we ordered the oysters, half with a bourbon \"sauce\" on top and half with a sriracha \"sauce\" on top. I really like oysters especially with a nice vinegar on top but these missed the mark. The presentation was great but the toppings ruined the taste of the oysters. Next we ordered the wings and they were awesome. They had a very potent hot sauce on them so watch out. They were huge and cooked to perfection with the right amount of juicyness. We plan on coming back here to try other menu options but you should really check this place out after a hard day at work."}
{"text":"Thanks for your late night menu........ I live on the street and wanted to get late night eats. Your kitchen \"was closed\"  However, after I posted this, Butcher reached out to me to find out the problem. I give them a lot of credit for doing so.  Although we could not get food our group did enjoy a few beers. The atmosphere is great for E. 4th. I wish them luck."}
{"text":"Food is still excellent! Service is still Meh! Prices and portions are still a disappointment!"}
{"text":"The good: I loved the decorations and the interesting bathroom set up. The waitress was awesome. She was really helpful in selecting the beers for our flights. The bad: The beers were not for us. I would pick Fat Heads or Great Lakes for a beer over here. We didn't try the food but I would go back and give it a shot and just get a bottle from the Friends of the Brewery list."}
{"text":"There is a lot on this menu I want to try but I wasnt starving so I opted for the smoked cheddar sausage with mashed potatoes.   It was soooo good,  first it's a big portion.  You get two delicious sausages on tops of a big bowl of potatoes and grilled onions.  The sausage had just a hint of spice and amazing cheesiness to It.  I can be weird about texture and this was no issue.  The mashed potatoes tasted like a twice baked potato scooped out and I couldn't stop eating it.  I dont love onions but I tried them and we're tasty.  They took on a smoky flavor and weren't over cooked, the firmness was good.  Sometimes onions can be overcooked and kind of enhances the overall dishes flavor but doesn't exactly stand out.  These did and I liked them.    Definitely get this.   Service was good, our server recommended It and she was spot on.   Atmosphere was cool for a Friday night, not too cray.  Also It was during the cavs first quarter so we had no issues."}
{"text":"This is our go to spot before any event at House of Blues. Beautiful location and the perfect place to grab a drink and some small plates before a show.   I'll speak more to the Public House here as the seating is usually readily available and the staff is great to work with your timeframe. We've worked through the brewery with a balanced selection of beer types no matter the time of year but also have to give a shout out to the craft cocktails which have always been well blended and generously poured.   We're such fans of building your own charcuterie and cheese selection. It's a great way to accommodate everyone in the party to make sure there's something they will enjoy. The oysters have always been fresh and on point. We've worked through the small plates and enjoy them all (though are a bit biased as a favorite of the group is the chorizo taco which is surprisingly refreshing). The flatbreads are well prepared with a nice dough to them and the toppings blend well.   For a place that offers a pretty extensive menu, we haven't run into anything we didn't like. Again a great place to go before House of Blues or even meeting up with friends after work."}
{"text":"OK, the food here is just wow.  My husband and I shared bacon wrapped dates, calamari, and sliders, which ended up being plenty of food for lunch.  The atmosphere was great and the staff was friendly.  Oh and the beer and beer based cocktails were great too!!"}
{"text":"So far the Butcher & The Brewer is among my favorite places Downtown.  Walking in, it's a huge space and the decor is very urban rustic (but modern).  There are big long wooden communal tables and the lighting quite cool.  I heard they are opening a sandwich/meat shop on the left-hand side so I am really looking forward to that!  The bathrooms are downstairs and there is a huge trough-like sink that separates the men and women.  Someone told me it's the most photographed bathroom in Cleveland...haha!  There is also a huge area downstairs where they have holiday parties, yoga for \"Bend and Brew\", and company gatherings.    As far as the food goes, I love the flatbreads!  They are the perfect size and have always been so good!  The bacon and eggs is also really good.  The bacon part is pork belly so if you aren't into fatty, then this might not be for you.  The sauce is this sweet but savory delicious concoction.  I recommend trying it!  A few people I've been with also ordered the chicken.  It's huge...a big huge plate of chicken...but really good as well.  And now to the most important part:  The booze.  They have wine on tap!  Do I need to say more??  Yes, I do.  Their beer selection is amazing and you can get a flight of 4 for $10 if you can't decide on one.    Everything at the Butcher & The Brewer has been great so far and I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"We got 6 \"snack\" plates to share. My favs were definitely the Calamari, 3 Bacon-Wrapped Dates, and 2 Chorizo Tacos.  Our server was on top of things upon our arrival, coming quickly by our table to take drink orders, checking back quickly after we requested more time, and coming back quickly with the drinks.   After that though it was a little hard to flag her down to order additional snacks when we were still hungry. She did not check on how the snacks were and was not the one to bring out the food so those were not opportunities to ask her though I suppose we could have asked those other staff who delivered the food.   My only con is the seating. I'm just not yet on the bandwagon of enjoying sharing a long table with strangers. When people not in your party get up and sit down it's awkward and looking around is awkward. It's the one part of cruise ships everyone aims to avoid - I don't know why restaurants are adopting it. I can't imagine it helps them fit that many more tables in.   Oh and in case you've not been before. Yes the men and women use the same bathroom."}
{"text":"Gluten free beer is kind of fruity but delicious and on tap! The potatoes are amazing and the pork shank was pretty good too, but it's so LOUD you cannot converse. Menu looks amazing, everyone's food looks great. Community style seating, and kids are ok here."}
{"text":"One of the best atmospheres to hang out and talk that I have went to in downtown. All of the food is shareables and come in large quantities. We ordered 3 dishes off of the  after hours menu, which is a smaller versions of the regular orders. And the 4 of us became full. I would highly suggest trying out the patatas bravas, they were delicious."}
{"text":"First time at Butcher and Brewer and because we were stuffed from dinner, we did not get a chance to try the food, so this review is only based on atmosphere, service and drinks.  I liked the space - large, nice spacious bar, cool stairs, black and white tvs. We were able to get 2 seats at the bar right away on a Friday night, which always makes me happy (i am lazy and wear uncomfy shoes) But boy was it LOUD!! Like jet engine loud! I could barely hear my date.     The bartender was very nice and efficient.  However, she didn't provide us with any menus for the beers.  I just ordered \"the strongest beer you have\" - that didn't clue her in that I had no idea what beers were available.  Too bad - I won't know what to order next time, since that was pretty good.  What if something stronger comes along?  All in all, a nice place to go, but not a great place to kick back and relax."}
{"text":"A lot of people are saying it's expensive, but I don't know, coming from Boston, it seems average. The neighborhood is awesome. My girlfriend and I had some beers on the patio right before a Cavs playoff game. Energy was great. We were really impressed by the space. This kind of establishment doesn't exist in Boston. Clevelanders, you're lucky. We had a fantastic time here and really really liked the beer. E. 4th street is a great area."}
{"text":"Great in theory but poorly executed.  The only good things about this place are the beers and our excellent server.  If you are looking for good food, do NOT come here.  The only thing on the menu that was executed correctly were the oysters.  It's hard to mess them up.  We were excited to try something new while visiting Cleveland this weekend but this place fell WAY short.  The menu looked very promising...can't go wrong with bone marrow and grilled octopus.  Too bad they didn't learn how to properly cook both dishes.  The first bone marrow that arrived at our table was a joke.  About 1/2 spoonful of marrow so we sent that one back.  The 2nd one wasn't much better.  3 toasts accompany the dish so you would think you would have marrow to cover those 3 toasts.  That was NOT the case.  And it was overcooked.  They should visit Purple Pig or Longman & Eagle in Chicago on how to execute this dish properly.  And where was the salt?  The octopus was also overcooked and rubbery.  Good flavors in the dish but again...poorly executed.  The pork dish that you make into tacos was OK at best no explanation about what the accompaniments were.  The staff needs to be trained to describe them when the food is brought to the table.  Same with the oysters...we asked which was which and the staff had no idea.  We had to wait 5 minutes for our waiter to stop back to describe them.  Overall, this place was a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"Great use of a historic place (it used to be a metro stop). Fantastic beer selection and even better food! I suggest the mac'n cheese for my fellow veggies.  If you're waiting at the bar it might take a while to get service. It's a little dressier than other downtown bars, but it's nice because there are places to sit down for table service and easier to hear each other. There is a large space downstairs for events. It's a good downtown place to take friends from out of town."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with a few friends on a Friday night. Our server, Mikey, was fantastic. We ordered a bunch of apps and a few entrees to all share. The timing of delivering all our selections was great. Of the 12 menu items we ordered almost all were amazing. A couple we were the biggest fans of, but that was just our tastes, not the quality of the dishes. Highly recommend the corn dogs, mac & cheese and shrimp & grits. Will definitely go back here again."}
{"text":"Started with the Merry Oysters, very tasty & the horseradish was super fresh! On to chorizo tacos which were delicious especially the goat cheese. Next up, roasted chicken which was a little dry but the chiles, sauce & smoky sausage made up for it. The Mac n cheese made the meal!"}
{"text":"I went there for a Cavs playoff game last year and I experienced the worst service. The waitress was extremely rude and slow. When it was time to get the bill I noticed she charged me for 3 beers when I only had 2. She told me it was because I got one from downstairs (while we were waiting to be seated).  I showed her the receipt and said I already paid but she got very angry and ripped the receipt out of my hand and said fine don't f--- pay for it. I told the manager about this and she didn't see to really care. I wrote an email to the restaurant about this experience and never heard back from them. I won't spend my money at a place that doesn't care about their guest experience."}
{"text":"Ehhh not too impressed. The food was okay but nothing outstanding and the service was fair. It's really loud which makes it hard to hear, especially if you're with a big group. The environment is really cool and unique but other than that nothing too special."}
{"text":"First time there. We were instructed to order multiple things like tapas but they are larger than tapas. Two dishes would be good for me. But we ended up getting 6 between the both of us -bread -bone marrow -snapper -branzino -steak tatare -mussels -more bread The artisan bread was addicting we had to order it twice. The bone marrow was tasty but was small. I don't know if we got unlucky with a small bone but we barely got two teaspoons worth of marrow. Tartare was served with a blanched egg, yolk was very good not cooked. Just cooked white. Mussels had a prominent bleu flavor. Overall food was great  Service was great. When we it wasn't over packed but it was semi full, and very very loud. Looking forward to their speakeasy."}
{"text":"East 4th Street is one of the best spots for a night out in Cleveland. The Butcher and the Brewer is one of the best options for a drink and a quick bite to eat. As the name suggests, this restaurant combines amazing in-house craft beer with their phenomenal in-house meats. I highly recommend the dry rub wings and beef sliders. It's a great place to try if you're on East 4th!"}
{"text":"Best sliders ever. Very good atmosphere to watch sport and have amazing beer. I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Excellent beer, food, location and staff. It's nice to find places like this!  The bathroom is an odd highlight of this place but why not?"}
{"text":"This is such a great addition to east 4th! I ended up here the other night. We walked in around 9pm on a Thursday and they were pretty busy, which was a great sign! There was a wait for a table of 4, so just grabbed some seats at the bar before we got the table.  I love the atmosphere in this place. Large open space with plenty of tables and booths, huge bar with plenty of seating, unique bathrooms with ladies on one side, guys on the other, and a communal sink. For a while, we thought something was wrong with the TVs, but then realized they were purposely all black and white - and we loved it! Adds to the ambiance - can watch your games, drink beer, while still not having a whole sports bar feel. There's a decent size patio outside - closed when we went b/c it was pretty chilly, but with the right weather, this would be a blast!   I never got her name, but the bartender who first helped me was amazing! She literally set up a sampling of all of the beers she thought I'd like and explained them all. I tried the Hasselhoff, Moocow Poncho, Framboyzee, and Femme Blonde. They were all pretty good in their own way, but I ended up settling on the Hasselhoff. For the most part, I really enjoyed it - but too clove-y for me after the whole glass. Tried my friends Stop Hop Kaboom- it was too hoppy for my taste, but he loved it.  Didn't try too much of the food since this was post-dinner for us, but did try the Pretzels which were delish. Not sure what the cheese was, not really pimento-ey but still great! Friends had the bread/spreads and crispy calamari, both which they loved. And, despite being ridiculously full, they serve Mitchell's ice cream and EVERYONE always has room for some mitchell's so I had a bowl of that :)   The hosts at the front, the bartenders, and the servers are all friendly and knowledgeable! Overall it was a great experience and I can't wait to make this a part of my \"regular places a visit\". Their website says brunch is coming soon - I'm a sucker for brunch, so can't wait to try it when they start having it!   LOVE that B&B is around the corner from my apartment and can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"I met up here with fellow Yelper, Sheena W for an early Saturday dinner.  This place is right downtown on E. 4th, where all the hip folks gather for a good time in the CLE.  The inside of the restaurant is nicely decorated and inviting.  It's long...the bar is on the left with huge thin-bezel LED TVs above it, followed by the open kitchen and the brewery straight in the back.  Downstairs they have some cool bathrooms where there's a communal hand washing area.  (check out the pics)  It was Downtown Cleveland Restaurant Week and they had a special 3 course menu, but we decided on some beers, apps, and burgers.  The hostess and server were very nice and attentive.  I had a pint of the Bravo Company IPA and although IPAs aren't my favorite, this was pretty good...very hoppy.  Sheena had a 4-beer flight sampler and I think she enjoyed it.  For an appetizer, I had the Crispy Brussel Sprouts and she had the loaded fries. Both were very tasty and seasoned well.  The burgers came out and mine was cooked a perfect medium.  The meat was juicy and flavorful and the brioche bun was nicely toasted.  Prices were about average for a downtown establishment and as many others have mentioned, it is very LOUD inside.  This place does participate in the  Balance and Brews events as well and we did noticed a few people inside with their yoga mats.  Overall, I did enjoy my dinner and I'd come back.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Opening night jitters? Someone told me it was their first night opening. So they should get a pass if things aren't up to par. Good industrial rustic setup. Waitress was quick to get our drinks. Portions are small so you need to set your expectations up first. Maybe the menu needs to be a little more descriptive but I got the jist from reading it.  Some may not.  As it got busier our waitress was not as present as we would have liked her to be.  We had to flag someone down to get our check.  I got the Lobster \"roll\" which was about 4oz of lobster and some bread pieces the size of large croutons.  It was very well done but was expecting a little more food for this entree.  My wife got the flatbread pizza, mushroom if I recall.  I had a bite it was very well done.  I'll have to come back to try their steaks and meats to see if they live up to the butcher in their name."}
