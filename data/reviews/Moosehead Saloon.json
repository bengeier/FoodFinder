{"text":"The atmosphere here in the Bay Village location is very welcoming and cozy, a bit small but that adds to the charm.  However, what I don't like about this establishment is that the food is overpriced and the service is underwhelming.  My friend and I went there during lunch and got the half sandwich and cup of soup \"special\". Well, it was definitely special! For $9 my friend and I each got a tiny cup of soup and the sandwich only consisted of turkey and cheese.  For $9 you would think my half sandwich would at least have lettuce, tomato, some condiments or something!  We had to ask for the waitress, who was very sweet, to bring us some condiments which she did promptly. As we started our tiny yet expensive meal a woman with short hair that I assumed was in management because she was going table to table asking patrons \"how is everything?\" walked by to ask how everything was.  In our response we asked her for a couple pickles, and how she responded was confusing, rude, and just unsatisfactory.  When we asked for a couple pickles she responded that she will get us some but that, \"pickles don't come with the lunch special\".  We were shocked because not only was her delivery rude,  we are already paying $9 for a tiny plain sandwich and small soup and this woman who was clearly in management of some sort was acting like we asked for her first born instead of some tiny pickles!  I have no idea how this place stays afloat with their high prices and okay food.  I think the neighborhood it's in really supports it because for prices like that I could be having lunch at high end restaurant. In my opinion the bar next door, The Ironwood, has just as good food but the prices and service are far better."}
{"text":"Food was good, but service was lacking.  The bar was not busy either as a matter of fact the first bartender was released so slow.  First bartender did not pour the right call vodka (maybe out in Far East westlake they don't drink the top shelf liquor).   After taking the first drink order the bartenders huddle and obviously said some thing about us two guys sitting at the bar.  You should trying to be a little discrete.  Obviously it was not something nice if you get my drift.  No we were not in drag.  Second bartender was a little nicer but still uncomfortable with us.  Even up to checkout process went out of her way to inflect not welcomed. To bad because the food was good.  We won't come back and neither should anyone else who are family."}
{"text":"This place is great in the summer. Awesome patio. Lots of selection. A little overpriced I think. Very cozy inside. I think that their appetizers and salads are the best bet."}
{"text":"Don't go if you aren't willing to wait for a little. Great place with delicious food and wonderful people working there. There was a forty minute wait when we got there but we were able to find a seat at the bar. I would recommend anyone that asked to go there."}
{"text":"First time here was great. The back patio provided a relaxing atmosphere after a long work week. The food was great, especially the burger. My only disappointment was the draft beer selection. Not bad, but certainly not great."}
{"text":"Everything about Moosehead is great! Over the past few years they have added more outdoor seating which is great for the summer time. The menu is great from salads to sandwhiches you cannot go wrong! If you have room at the end of the night...the fried ice cream is delicious as well!   I don't believe they take reservations but wait and have a drink at the bar--or even eat there. It is worth the wait.   The owner is not the friendliest but don't let that bother you! The food and atmosphere is great. It is hard to find good restaurants with outdoor seating... and Moosehead is a great place to go!"}
{"text":"Been there a few times now, all at lunch time.  The food is good, chips are awesome, but have never experienced one friendly employee yet.  So many other places I would rather go if they are going to be pushy, crabby and rushing me."}
{"text":"A typical Bar and Grill but with limited seating. It only seats 56 people so its really small but thats what gave it its charm. I went during lunch and I had the triple decker club and what can i say, it was a club.......I think if I would have been around during happy hour i would have gone back. Cant wait to come back the next time im in Westlake"}
{"text":"This place is so cute and cozy. I really wanted to like it, but I found the food boring. I so love that they serve house made potato chips, but they just come out in a big lump instead of individual crispy chips. I think this is a great place for families to bring picky kids who only like bland foods, but I just like a little more to my food."}
{"text":"It's really the only reason I come out to Westlake besides Crocker. I'm a huge fan of the French dip sandwiches. Last time I was here, the service was poor and the staff looked distracted. I didn't care that much.   I would mostly recommend this place because it's the kind of bar/grill/pub that doesn't exist in the outermost suburbs. The appetizers and sandwiches are abundant. This is just the kind of Cleveland establishment built for a suburban crowd in the most diverse area of the far west."}
{"text":"Place is consistent with good food and decent prices. Menu is typical bar fare with the welcome addition of homemade chips. Cozy patio for warmer weather months. More of a restaurant than a \"neighborhood bar.\" Recently visited during a Cavs game which was played on television but not streamed on the speakers (the restaurant chose to continue to play pandora radio instead). Always enjoy my meals here."}
{"text":"Moosehead has really good food for a simple night out, not to expensive, and pretty good food and service.  The only issue  (which is a big issue with Moosehead) is that it is a very small restaurant.  Almost every time you go finding a parking spot is almost always impossible,  but if you are lucky to find one, you are then asked to wait about 20 min or more. Of course this is more of an issue on weekends,  but they really are way too small of a restaurant for the amount of business they get."}
{"text":"It's not often I send a meal back, but sometimes you just have to.  And when you do, the last thing you want is an argument from the manager.  Still great food (except the so-called blackened fish) but LOW CUSTOMER SERVICE by my standards."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill. Used to be a great little place to get a sand which and beer. Food was always good and I have been coming here for years. Last two times have been horrible. A BLT with wilted lettuce and the core of tomato in the sandwich. Had to send it back. My fish sandwich was so gross I had two bites. Also when they bring your food the waitresses thumb is in the middle of the food. So basically your eating her thumb. Yuck , won't be coming back. Need new management asap...."}
{"text":"The food is decent, above average. The best part is the house made chips and french onion dip that come with the sandwiches. The peirogi melt is a heart attack on bread, but worth every calorie. The reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 4 or 5 is because of the service. The staff is just plain unfriendly. I recently picked up an order. When I called it in, it was 4 pm. I was transfered twice, and finally someone audibly sighed in the phone and said 'what's your order?' They said 20 minutes, i got there in 30. I was literally the only person in the restauant, and not one of the 4 servers standing at the bar asked to seat me or help me. They acted annoyed I was there. Then it took another 10 minutes to get my food (now 40 minutes after I ordered). Not one person there ever said thank you. The person behind the bar said, \"you cash her out\" to another server then walked away from me. This makes it pretty clear they don't want to do carry out orders. Which is too bad for them since I sunk 50 bucks on a couple of sandwiches and a couple kids meals, and won't be doing that again."}
{"text":"Small rustic gold mine! Always great food! Chips and dip are a must eat! French onion soup is great! Hand cut fries and great sandwiches that always have a spin on them."}
{"text":"I am a repeat customer who enjoys  visiting Mooshead at least once a month. This time was much different than all the rest. To my surprise they cut their menu significantly and raised their prices. A couple sitting at the table next to us also noticed the difference and left after just ordering their drinks. I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Love the food. However, they should really get the ball rolling on finding a bigger location with more available parking. And no I don't feel like driving all the way to Olmsted Falls out of my way just for that."}
{"text":"Great homemade chips and dip, blue cheese burger delicious. Friendly service."}
{"text":"Love it!!!! such a unique menu with such great sandwiches/salads and you have to try the chips & dip...i think that is what brings me back time and time again."}
{"text":"Have a new opinion of the Moosehead... Went with my dad and had the buffalo chicken wonton things (forget what they're called). Ok--they were awesome! And then I had a taco salad, also yummy. Ordered a christmas ale and it was served in a frosty mug. That's all it takes to make me happy"}
{"text":"Food is consistently good, cozy atmosphere and cute patio, as well as friendly service."}
{"text":"To be quite honest I had never heard of this place until my boyfriend suggested we stop and eat here before seeing a movie at Crocker Park. What a great find!  Right as we sat down a party of 40 was seated on the back patio and we still got our orders in a timely fashion- very impressed! I ordered the Crusted Pecan Salad with Chicken and Whoa! was it amazing! The Cranberry Vinaigrette that comes with it is absolutely delicious! I would buy a jar of it! My boyfriend ordered the Grilled French Onion Steak Sandwich that was equally delicious! I will definitely be back to try the pierogi melt that I had my eye!"}
{"text":"This was one of the first restaurants I went to when I first moved here and continue to go back. If you go for lunch, get there before noon because it will fill up fast when the patio isn't open. I've always had good food here -- fish sandwiches, french dip, hummus, soups, homemade potato chips. You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Best wings around by far. So delicious. The salads are great too! The place gets crowded easily and the parking lot can be stressful and spill out into the street during peak hours but the staff is usually attentive!"}
{"text":"This is one of my two must visit restaurants in Cleavland (the other being Salmon Dave's). A rare 5 stars. Try the Chicken Philly, and their fries are the best!   Perch is always good, (OK, the grouper fingers were the only questionable thing I've ever had).   On this week's visit I took someone who had not been to Cleveland before and we sat on the patio, perfect evening, and exactly what we were looking for.   Needless to say, I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"I love this spot. Right around the corner from Crocker Park. We always get take-out because it's a quick walk from my house.  The venue is nice but isn't the largest so when they get crowded it's sometimes tough to get a table.   Full bar and menu which includes your typical bar food. I have only had their burgers but they are fantastic. I recommend the blackened tuna steak burger if you want something different."}
{"text":"Moosehead is great if you want an updated take on bar food. They have typical items that you would find on a bar menu like sandwiches and burgers but with a twist. I have had a lot of different things here with some of my favorites being their French onion burger and their salmon burger with thai chili sauce, YUM! They also have really good soups!  The dining room is small but it has a nice atmosphere. The service is good and they have an outdoor patio as a bonus!   **If you have been here before, they just recently got a new menu!**"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this area of NE Ohio for a long time (family in the area) so I've been here at least six-eight times over the last several years.  The one characteristic that stands out is inconsistency.  It's a local place that caters to a comfort food crowd.  They try to be creative with some of their menu items but it's almost too much.  The menu is all over the place and I want them to seriously think about cutting the menu down and focus on doing fewer things but doing them better.  I was here Tuesday night and had the grilled chicken sandwich.  After a LONG wait, it finally arrived drier than an old shoe and with no discernible flavor whatsoever.  It was served with bacon (which was not specified on the menu) and I had asked for the sweet potato fries which were good.  The folks both had burgers and while they enjoyed them, my mom also complained that it was cold.  Our server was handlling both the bar and some of the booths so she was distracted and not particularly warm or engaging.  Ironically, I've had the same chicken sandwich here before and it was yummy.  I'm not a fan of places that have menus with an almost alarming number of ways to serve burgers or 12 types of sandwiches and attempting to be clever with \"Irish\" nachos - huh?  Appetizers in the past have been okay.  I do like the neighborhood feel here but I wouldn't go rushing back for the food any time soon."}
{"text":"Great beers and awesome place. This building was an old fire house in Olmsted Falls, Ohio and is in a gorgeous part of town with a lot of nice local things to see.   The fish and chips rock anytime of year. And if you're there over Xmas, get a Christmas Ale with cinnamon and sugar on the rim."}
{"text":"Was here a year ago, was pleased then with service and food.   But I now tried it again this past week, but a totally different impression.   First, the hostess who seated us was not warm and welcoming, made it feel like a chore that we had arrived.  Really?   Honey, you're the first impression of a place, so you already set the pace on a bad start.   We sat, got menu, and ordered drinks.  Have to say happy hour prices and pour were both very good.   Menu is a hodge podge of things, but some basic information that should be there on the menu is not.  Example- you can order ribs, you get the meat portion only but must order any sides individually.  That's fine, but the menu shows no prices for sides-- are they $2, $5, $10 each?    Also, they only have one burger on the menu, it actually sounds very nice and delicious, but what happens if you just wanted a plain basic burger-- not there.   And for that one they do have on the menu, I live in NYC, one of the most expensive places in the country and I can think of 10 places in NYC where the burger price is lower than what they offer here.   Once again, the menu does not give you information-- is it a 1/4 lb burger, 1/2 lb burger, or a patty the size of something you'd find on a slider?  For $11 for a burger, it better be damn big, and it better be some very prime beef.  Ahhhh the special for that evening sounded good, but once again-- no info!   Does it come with any side(s)?   Needless to say, after the lack of hospitality from the hostess, to realizing that i'd have to quiz our server on every aspect of the menu, it just felt like too much of a challenge.  Drink was good, went elsewhere for dinner.  Was warmly greeted, had sensational service, and had every question that I could have ever asked already addressed in the menu."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. I expected it to get better, but it did not. I ordered the fish n chips. I got super greasy flaccid fish and fries. On top of that, the bartender/waiter charged me for the large platter which I guess he thought I wanted being a petite girl and assuming and all. Never going back!!"}
{"text":"Food is great, especially the French onion dip they have.  I'm assuming it's home made.  It's a small restaurant, but I've never had to wait long if I wasn't seated right away."}
{"text":"Great food but always seems to be a wait at the times you'd expect to be busy.  Get here early.  If there are no seats, always check out bar and see if you can grab a place there."}
{"text":"Wonderful perogi melt on pumpernickel and chips are great. Love this place"}
{"text":"I always forget about the Moosehead, but I have been here a number of times.  It used to be Herbs when I was growing up.    They have great salads, sandwiches, and Homemade Potato Chips w/ homemade chip dip.   You don't see that very often, but its good stuff.    The moosehead is great place to grab lunch or have a few beers after work.    Get there early because this place is packed 24/7."}
{"text":"Growing up in Bay, I went to this neighborhood restaurant for YEARS with my parents.  The food is high quality, with up-scale pub fare on the menu.  In my opinion, their burgers are some of the best around.  Other than that, the menu has a bunch of seafood options including fresh fish from Lake Erie. Their sweet potato fries are delicious as well. I've never had a bad experience here.   Occasionally the wait times can be a litle bit excessive, since they don't have many tables...but hey, what can you do?  Its worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Had lunch at Moosehead today. Service was good, food was fresh and very tasty. Very clean and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I love the location and atmosphere of Moosehead, and the food was ok, definitely your average bar food with some healthy alternatives thrown in, but I really can't figure out how they justify the prices. Right next door is Ironwood and the food is as good if not better, but the prices are way better there. At Moosehead I paid $8 for a glass of wine that the bottle costs $13. That's just too much for a bar/restaurant on Dover. Kind of ruined the evening. Still a cute back patio.  I also had a server who was nice, but  I asked what was good and he named a few things that were his favorites and then I found out later it was his first day. I would have preferred he just be honest and say he hadn't had everything and didn't know what everyone orders there. I'll go back, but probably not on purpose."}
{"text":"Eaten here many times in the last several years and the food and service is great.  Great atmosphere and I have never been disappointed.  Both locations Westlake and Olmsted Falls!"}
{"text":"Better than average, we dine here a few times a year. Good food, I had a pesto chicken tortellini pasta that was delicious. Portions are large. Offers a variety of drink options from unusual teas to good beer on tap and a full bar. Great for summer too with a cute patio. Service has also always been good."}
{"text":"Lively local bar/ restaurant without the usual bar food. Menu options for everyone with great burgers , sandwiches and salads. I love there soups and specials. We will be back"}
{"text":"This place is not bad for bar food and has a great little patio out back. I came in on a Friday night for dinner with a couple other people. We didn't have to wait but almost every table on the patio was filling up.   I did not order any alcohol but a friend tried to order two different beers and they were out of both. I had a burger with BBQ pork on it. I asked for it done medium well and it was cooked to my liking. However I also asked for tomato and lettuce and I didn't get it. I didn't mention it because by the time I had eaten the wings we ordered for an appetizer i was barely hungry for the burger and ended up taking most of it to go.    I thought the food was ok but kind of expensive for bar food. It wouldn't be high on my list of places to come back to."}
{"text":"I'm a fan - I love the atmosphere and the food is usually great. In particular, I had the Irish nachos the last time I was here and they were THE BEST nachos I have ever had (homemade chips, ground beef, corned beef, lots of cheese, etc.).   On this particular occasion I was on a business lunch so I decided to try the Reuben sandwich. For the most part it was good, but the corned beef was a bit fatty which I hate. However, the side of chips and dip made up for the so-so sandwich.   I guess next time I'll have to try something different - or just go back to the Irish nachos!"}
{"text":"I used to love the Moosehead... I will say though that my last visit was less than stellar and I left very disappointed wondering what had happened to one of my favorite little places.    The menu has changed, the service has gotten slower (and it was always kind of slow before), and the overall experience was just meh.  Are the chips and dip still great, yes... THANK GOD for that!"}
{"text":"Went to MOOSEHEAD on Friday night for there clam bake. Very disappointing to say the least. The chicken consisted of a small chicken Breast grilled, no clam broth, no sweet potatoes just potato wedges. The clams were cold and it was $22.00 a person. Won't be going there for a clam bake again"}
{"text":"Love it.  Always a great meal.  Portions are HUGE.  The patio is a great addition.  Small and cozy inside.  Nice beer selection on tap.....free pretzel sticks.  Nice place to start out if staying local then heading to ironwood or anywhere in Westlake."}
{"text":"The Surf & Turf Burger brings me back, again and again. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Have been going to Moosehead in Westlake for years... went tonight and was pretty disappointed! Food was great, server was excellent however they cut their menu back by over half!! AND They used to have huge portions but those too have been cut back and are still the same price! The menu changes were not for the better and as a regular it was extremely disheartening to see the cut back portions as before I'd have left overs for another meal! Not sure if we will be back as 70.00 was quite a bit of money for two people and small portions."}
{"text":"Great place with it's own label brew on tap.  Lovely patio dining, might want to bring some bug spray.  Solid pirogi's which come on a sandwhich, I just skipped the bread.  Great guacamole!  Solid cocktails."}
{"text":"The Moosehead Salon holds a place very close to my heart.  It's my go to place if there's nothing else to do or if I just want to get out of the house.  The place itself is small, there might be a wait and the food takes a pretty long time to come out.   Now that that's all out of the way we can get to the important stuff.  The turkey burger.  Wow.  I've had plenty of turkey burgers and they usually come out dry and bland.  Their turkey burgers come with a cranberry mayo AND another delicious sauce.  They're always juicy and fantastic.  The same goes with their other sandwiches.  From a chicken sandwich with a breaded mozzarella patty or the moosini with french fries and homemade slaw, always good.  They all come with their crisp homemade chips and dip. They always have unique beers on tap but their real gem is their root beers. I love root beer and they have several delicious varieties."}
{"text":"This was my favorite place around the corner. But they cut all of my favorite vegetarian options off the menu. The veggie burger, which was fabulous, and all of my favorite salads are off the menu. I can't go here anymore. Otherwise, would have been an excellent review. What happened to the Moosehead we all loved?"}
{"text":"Saturday 7pm, wanted 20 min for a table. So worth it.   Potato skins are to die for. And the turkey moosini is the bomb.   Ask for those tho, not of menu but bringing it back on menu / still ask !   $12 for a good sandwich, yes please"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years for their delicious burgers and homemade chips with dip.  The inside of the restaurant is cozy. There are about a dozen tables, a small bar, and a patio with a few more tables. The restaurant gets busy so I usually only come here if I can get there as soon as they open. Back into your parking spot too! The parking lot is as \"cozy\" as the inside of the restaurant. The service varies, but has never been amazing. I come for the food and forgive the service.  The menu is large with typical bar foods, sandwiches, and burgers. The best food item here without a doubt is the burgers. You choose your patty size and toppings. Each burger comes with homemade potato chips and a homemade French onion dip. During the summer they offer a Greek Chicken Pasta Salad that is light and delicious."}
{"text":"This place is walking distance from my house so we decided to give it a try. Teeny tiny on the inside. Service was awkward. They didn't have the beer stocked that my husband initially chose from the menu. They messed up my order and had to send it back to the kitchen to fix it. When they got it right, food was decent but nothing special. Kind of overpriced but at least it was not awful. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I met a friend for lunch today for my first visit here.   The first thing I noticed when I walked in - it is SMALL and it reminds me of my grandparents TV den full of cabin knick knacks (add a small hoarding problem.) This place is packed, but I like it.   After the charming location, I noticed the smell- delicious BBQ. Totally made me second guess the spinach salad I scoped out on their website menu.   Per the menu online, it says the following description, including a breaded artichoke heart, but when I ordered, it came with breaded mozzerella squares. No biggie- anything fried is pretty awesome.   THE POPEYE Fresh spinach is topped with crumbled dry bleu cheese, dried cherries, mushrooms, red onions, pecans and a breaded artichoke heart. Choice of dressing. Chicken or Portabella 14 Steak or Shrimp 17  Seriously, $17 for a salad? Bit pricey for a salad at lunch time.   We arrived around 11:30, but the lunch crowd was in full force, so we took an immediate place at the bar. A friendly waitress took our order shortly after. And then we waited, and waited, and waited.  She stopped by once to say they were working our order. Our food came just after 12:30.   Seriously, an hour wait at the bar? But I get it, it was Friday, it was packed.   The salad was delicious, came with really good cranberry vinaigrette but I didn't even need it because all the ingredients were so yummy. I opted for the chicken and it was perfectly grilled and not dry at all. I really like that salad, I would eat that salad again for dinner and tomorrow for breakfast.   I will definitely be back for another try,  DEFINITELY NOT at lunch time when I need to be back at work."}
{"text":"Moosehead has succeeded for years with pretty standard and unremarkable bar food complemented by a decent beer list. It's a friendly and clean place with a nice atmosphere, but not one you'd go out of your way to visit. For that reason, it had been a while since I'd been. I remember pretty good service here in general, but if my last visit was my first, there would be a danger of the dreaded one-star review. They were understaffed, and nobody dining there was getting decent service. That included me, and I arrived hungry and thirsty on my bike. Slaking my thirst might have been easier with a divining rod. Hyperbole aside, it took no less than 10 minutes to be acknowledged, another 10 to receive a beer, and almost 30 before I was presented with the water I requested on arrival. The menu has something for everyone, which is often not as good as it sounds. The wheelhouse of the kitchen is bar food, and I dared to go vegetarian, with mediocre results (hummus should not be able to double as paste). Good thing for Moosehead that it has lots of regulars. I won't be one."}
{"text":"I went during lunch. It was packed but only had to wait around 5 mins for a booth. I got a mozzarella maddness with veggies sandwich and a side of fries. Delicious! There were lots of not meat options. The service was a little slow.  It was around 1:30pm when we finished our lunch, not a lot people left but still took a while to get our check. If you go during lunch, just know it will not be quick."}
{"text":"This is certainly no Cabin in the Woods! It's a more friendly atmosphere and during lunch, the incoming light lets you see all the little intricate details spread throughout the restaurant. The engravings, cedar color wood stains and especially the pulley system fans throw you back in time. I went during a weekday lunch and was somewhat surprised at how packed it was. It was a nice day but the patio wasn't available, so people wanted to do that, from what I overheard incoming customers asking the servers. Seemed like a menu with a number of options, I settled on the Irish Burger. Great for carnivores, it's a burger topped with corned beef and swiss cheese on grilled rye bread with the 1000 island dressing on the side. It was an average sized portion, nothing crazy. A little pricey for what you get - you get chips instead of fries (probably can get as an upsell). Full bar to wet your whistle, should you choose."}
{"text":"I am a huge Moosehead fan, but I swear every time it is okay at best. I'm really not sure why I keep going back. This time I was really annoyed because I was told I could t have a straw as they were competing in the last straw challenge. It was annoying as I prefer to drink out of straws. Next, when the straw is brought to me, I was told that they would no longer be providing them. I think that's a bit nuts.   In to my entree, I got a grilled chicken salad. It was good, but made me incredibly sick after eating it. I'm not sure if it was undercooked or what."}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for a new place to try and we've always wanted to stop in Olmsted Falls. The moose head hook and ladder was a great option. The service was great, decor was fun and the food was awesome. Can't wait to go back. Dinner was followed by a nice walk around the town. Definitely recommend stopping in and trying the sampler platter. Pepper jack cheese sticks were so good stretchy and melty with just the right \"bite\". Pepper jack cheese after all. My wife had there French onion soup and I had a walleye sandwich. I'm house made chips made even better with being served with French onion dip."}
{"text":"As soon as I drove up to this place I knew it had character. Inside didn't disappoint, I sat at the bar. Long bar with plenty of room and a saloon feel. The staff was prompt and courteous. I had Moosehead on draft (haven't seen it on draft in decades). The tuna sandwich was perfectly cooked to a medium rare as ordered. All the ambiance, good food and beverages came at a nice price. I will go back soon."}
{"text":"Just had dinner here with a business colleague. They had some nice beers on tap and served up some good wings. I liked their french onion soup and they had a unique fajita salad (that I had with their steak). The dressing was great. The service was a tad slow, but it didn't bother us as we had a lot to chat about. I'd go back, there were many items on the menu (which is huge) that sounded really good."}
{"text":"Moosehead is one of those warm, cozy, quirky establishments whose ambiance cannot be matched anywhere else.   I frequent this location for working lunch and it is such a wonderful break from the cold harsh business world.  It is lovely to bring clients here and relax over a salad or burger under the warm homey decor.  I'd love to try this place for happy hour!"}
{"text":"Great patio and friendly, attentive service. Food was 'ok,' nothing super-spectacular but not awful.   I ordered a salad and thought the lettuce could have been a little more fresh. There were a lot of pieces that were brown and/or rusted looking, and the bread it came with tasted a little doughy and almost raw, and was totally bland. $13 seemed a little steep for the quality.  If I'm in the area I may try it again and just get something different, but this isn't on my go-to list."}
{"text":"Recommended to me by my realtor, I have been back many times and have taken out of town visitors as well. They are always crowded and we have spent 30 minutes at the bar a few times (not a bad place to be). Guinness on tap, but this is Cleveland after all.  The menu is kind of neat and all the items are exceptionally good. Their homemade potato chips are excellent and come with most sandwiches. We've been there for many a light meal and never come away disappointed. The place could easily be expanded but they like it just the way it is. One of my favorite bars in the area. Always a good conversation at the bar.  Be careful when you leave - if you make a left and go over the tracks, you are in Bay Village. The town is dry and the police have been known to sit in the parking lot of the shopping center just past the tracks. You are much better of going out the other way, towards Detroit Road.  \"The Moosehead - where Westlake meets Bay\""}
{"text":"Tried the moose head saloon with a co-worked for dinner. Setup is a little strange walk in the front door and almost no where to stand if the bar is crowded, your sort of in top of the diners to the left. We were stood there for a few minutes and were then greeted by a waitress, no room for a hostess stand, just a sign saying seat yourself, but it didn't appear you could. Oh well pretty much the only downside so that's pretty good. Menu is pretty extensive for a local eatery/pub/restaurant.  I ordered the BBQ trio platter, chic breast, rib and shrimp came with slaw and house made chips. They brag about their ribs and rightfully so, they were pretty darn good. I also had the French onion soup and it was very good as well. The waitress was excellent and was always there filling our drinks long before they were done. Next time I'm back, it's a definite stop going forward, need to try some of the other   Menu items that looked intriguing."}
