{"text":"The food was good but it was really busy so it was a little slow. Because of this she brought us out some treats at the end. The service and desserts were wonderful."}
{"text":"This place is great! It has good atmosphere in a pretty location and the barista was very helpful. I loved their fresh, flaky croissants, and I'd like to come back some time to try their food menu!"}
{"text":"Visited here several times for food and beverages while staying in the water front area during our a-week-long visit to Toronto. We were very happy with everything we tried here, although it is a bit pricy. My husband and I thought the quality of food and beverages were appropriate for their price tags as nothing they made seemed carelessly done - which caused it longer for everything to come out. They also actually spend time talking to their customers to help them customize their drinks as well. It definitely felt like they take an ownership to the food/beverages they serve. There was two Starbucks that we could go instead, but we always ended up here for teas and lattes with a simple bite."}
{"text":"This place is great and much needed on Queens Quay. I just don't understand why it isn't open earlier in the morning when I am looking to buy coffee. I think the place looses business by waiting to open until after everyone has already finished the commute to work."}
{"text":"This caf√© on the harbour front is a local gem. 
You are always greeted with a genuine, warm smile and treated like a neighbour. The ambiance inside is so pleasant and relaxing that you can really unwind and enjoy your downtime or out-of-office work time. Weather you like to lean back into a sofa and watch out the window, meet a friend at a table, pull up a stool to the window bar or even schedule your next meeting of up to 6 around one large table, you will find a setup to suit your every mood and occasion. 
- Elsa, the owner, knows her customers by name
- Very relaxing and cozy place
- View of harbour, runners and cyclists
- Good coffee, snacks and food menu
- Wi-Fi
- Not too busy/ noisy
- A great place to spend time in

I recommend it highly to anyone who wants to sit down and relax over a good cup of coffee or soup & sandwich."}
{"text":"The place is charming and quiet. Staff are friendly. Their menu is traditional.. Cappuccino tasted good but was too foamy. The almond croissant was good. It's a nice place to read, work and hangout with friends as well."}
{"text":"I enjoyed their large strawberry rhuburb pie :)"}
{"text":"Java is solid but I thoroughly enjoy warm lentil soup. The multigrain toast was dripping in Buddha. #YUM"}
{"text":"Cutest cafe in Queen's Quay! Coffee drinks are delicious. I like the decor, and there's a few tables with comfortable seating. It's a nice quiet area so I love coming on the weekend and grabbing a cappuccino and pastry and people (actually dog) watching. Paninis and soups are delicious too!"}
{"text":"Staff is very friendly and personable. Seems like a coffee shop version of cheers. 

Coffee is excellent. Food is delicious. It is a little on the expensive side but that can be expected for a small business in the location."}
{"text":"Came here today for first time - easy to walk by and miss but it's beautiful inside; both in cleanliness and decor. 

Staff were very friendly and engaged in conversation, letting me know about upcoming local events. I was offered free honey waffle samples while enjoying my late inside. 

Prices are not to bad all things considered. Working piano inside is a nice touch. 

Will be back to try some selections of baked goods."}
{"text":"This place is great and the owner is very nice and welcoming. I ordered a sandwich and a soy latte. I thought the latte was alright but the sandwich was pretty good."}
{"text":"I visited on a Monday afternoon.  Its a very pleasant environment, a little loud for those who need total silence to read.  The wifi is free, but a little bit slow (though I did have Outlook open on my computer and was browsing the internet, as well as downloading songs onto my iPhone on Spotify and streaming Spotify, as well as downloading podcasts in the background on my iPhone).

I had a BBQ chicken sandwich with a side of chickpeas.  The sandwich was very good.  I would normally say its not worth $9.50, but that is standard here in downtown Toronto.  I also got a hot chocolate, which was quite good (definitely much better than Starbucks).  Though they did lose a few points for the over-priced hot chocolate ($4.50/large).

The seating was adequate (though I have a filling it fills up on the weekends [especially when cooler out]).  I sat in one of the comfy orange chairs.  The whole place has a very cozy/quaint feel.  There is also outdoor seating on the sidewalk (covered/shade), though I didn't sit out there (for fear of a slower wifi connection - gotta download my Comedy Bang Bang podcast!).

The staff was very pleasant, and courteous.

If I am ever back to this area of Toronto I will be sure to stop by."}
{"text":"I work very close by and I like this place alot.  The food is always good and the young ladies who work there are always exceptionally friendly and helpful.  The ONLY thing I don't like is how the person in charge (manager/owner?) is condescending to the young ladies that work there and to myself.  If they don't do something perfect or the way she would do it, she has no problem publicly reprimanding them loud enough for customers to hear.  Newsflash - it's a coffee shop not a dictatorship - chill out a bit! I would have given 5 stars if not for her."}
{"text":"I went for the first time this past Saturday around noon:

5/5 food
5/5 atmosphere 
6/5 for service! The lady at the cash register was unbelievably friendly, very personal, and knows how to run a business! From the beginning to the end she was on it! Also just overhearing her greeting and talking to other customers about the food and how she personally recommends ordering was very nice of her and also a smart way of upselling.
I had the hot chocolate and the 5$ breakfast sandwich. My food came out hot fresh and delicious!

I would recommend and will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Not my favourite neighbourhood place. They're over priced. The coffee isn't good at all. And the service is mediocre. The food isn't anything great but edible."}
{"text":"What a lovely little place! And might I add one of the few (ok the only) coffee shop in my hood!

I've been to this cafe a few times. I never find it too busy. There are little tables and trendy sofas to lounge on. I always enjoy the service here; the staff is very friendly and great at suggesting menu options. 

I came here last week to grab a coffee on my way home. They just seemed do darn happy to serve me! I got a fresh pot of coffee and I really enjoyed my little cheesecake square (great way to maintain portion control and only $1.25). There was someone playing guitar, which set the relaxed atmosphere.

The cafe also serves a full range of sandwiches, panini's and soup. I think it would be a nice place to take a friend for lunch/snack if you are visiting the waterfront. Its more unique than the other franchise coffee shops along the harbour."}
{"text":"Very quiet, clean, can sit outside. AND excellent espresso - made a great americano, with perfect size serving - not watered down in a huge cup like Starbucks.

Saved my review until after I tried the food. Had a pulled pork sandwich and it was great. Good homemade food.

Friendly staff/owners as well. When I was there, they accommodated 5-6 women with babies and strollers by moving around some seating.

Worth to walk towards Spadina, I choose it over Starbucks and Williams."}
{"text":"My favorite place! Great food, beverages & ambiance! Owners Elsa & Steve are lovely & they have free WiFi - love this place :)"}
{"text":"best spot for a nice homemade lunch. Also, Iced americanos are LIFE!! Felix and Jessica are a bundle of joy and brighten my day."}
{"text":"I live by this cafe and stopped in with a friend a few weeks ago for tea. 

Two teas cost me nearly $7. I was appalled. 

I don't understand the logic behind their prices. It wasn't the first time I'd been shocked by their prices either. I find their food extremely sub-par as well, unfortunately. 

I'm all for local, independently run coffee shops, but these guys really have to step up their game if they want to stay in business with Starbucks opening up shop a few doors down."}
{"text":"Casual, quaint place on the lakefront. Owner is kind and attentive and caring, the lentil soup is AMAZING, and whatever the other reviews say about prices being inexpensive: they're wrong! Super cheap pastries and coffee drinks compared to US prices, especially being in downtown Toronto. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic addition to the waterfront area, which just opening this summer next to the Walter Carsen Centre for the National Ballet of Canada. Amidst Starbucks, Second Cup, Coffee Time and Williams Coffee Pub, Music Garden Cafe is a breath of fresh air and the kind of place that actually makes you slow down for a moment rather than just grab and dash. 

Owner, Elsa is chatty and warm. She listens patiently as the woman in front of me tells her how she just got in a car accident on her birthday (and she later brings this woman a slice of chocolate cake - \"for the birthday girl\") and after I take my first sip of a blissful chai latte ($3.50) asks me if it's hot enough. 

The place is quite small, with a mix of arm chairs, sofas, and stools at the window looking out on the lake and the Toronto Music Garden. The space is pretty, with mini chandeliers and orchids. There are a few patio tables on Queens Quay, even in November! There are lots of magazines to flip through. One of the other staff plays the guitar from time to time. Otherwise the iPod plays an eclectic mix of Elliot Smith, Norah Jones, and world music. 

I didn't try any of the food items, although they were making some grilled sandwiches that smelled delicious! They have daily specials, salads, soups, and lots of pastries including Portuguese egg tarts."}
{"text":"This is a great neighbourhood coffee place! The food is delicious and the staff are really kind and personable, which makes me more inclined to come back! It's a great alternative to the larger franchises around - support local businesses!! However. Couldn't give it five stars because service is really slow."}
{"text":"it's a fine cafe that makes a solid cup of coffee and offers decent food. it's a nice place to sit for a while or get something to enjoy at the park across the street. the servers are friendly and quick to help.

if i had a complaint, it'd be that they're a little slow, but i may also be a little impatient. ;)"}
{"text":"Mesmerizing London Fog. I have them at every possible coffee and tea location and it's the best I ever tasted. My boyfriend had a slice of lemon pie topped with crunchy cream cheese and he ate every last bit on his plate, silently and almost in a trance state.

Beside the super-good food, the cafe is cozy, nicely decorated (Tapestry! Flowers! Candelabras!) and located just beside the waterfront, so that makes it the perfect stop in your daily/weekly walk in the park."}
{"text":"Great coffee... even better chili! Decor is nice and cozy.  Queens Quay has been needing something like this for a long time!"}
{"text":"Came here today for the first time. The service was polite and friendly. Free fast wifi. They serve soups, paninis, bagels, smoothies, and espresso based drinks. Normal drop coffee is like 1.15, 2, 2.15 for S,M, L respectively. 
I got the lentil soup which was really good ($6.5). And I got the roasted chicken panini w goat cheese ($9.75) Yum! It's served w a bit of Potato salad (tastes like store bought Ziggys) but everything else tasted really good. A bit on the pricier side but it's a nice place in downtown toronto w good offerings."}
{"text":"Would not recommend for food, super plain and over priced for what it is. I would rather have a McDonalds egg mcmuffin over the one they served here.... so bland."}
