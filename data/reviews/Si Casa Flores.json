{"text":"The waiters were very friendly, the portions were big and the quality was very good. Its like this with many of the mexican restaurants I've been to, though all in all I was very satisfied! :3"}
{"text":"While traveling south we stopped for the night. It was raining and we wanted Albondigas. Best we've ever had. Great service!"}
{"text":"On our way through Oregon and we stopped here for lunch.  Beautiful restaurant with tasteful decor and ambience.  The food was delicious and the service, outstanding! We highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"I see 1 to 3 stars and realize some people are very hard to please, but quick to complain, so I discount their review.  My wife and I have visited this restaurant often and had ordered a variety of menu items.  So far we have always been happy with both the service and the food.  For my taste the salsa is top notch, and the margaritas are pretty darn good too.  Prices are a bit higher than what I'm used to paying, but I keep going back because of the taste."}
{"text":"Came here after a bad experience at the Grass Shack.  The service was terrific, the Carne Asada was decent, but slightly over cooked.

Would have been a solid 3 stars on any other day, but I'm giving one extra just for the service I received after getting none across the way."}
{"text":"My family went here for dinner after a long drive. We were surprised by the large portions and the interior. The inside is colorfully decorated, with murals on one part of the wall and two rows of Frida Kahlo portraits on another wall. For food, my dad got the Mexican pizza which he loved, my sister got a cup of tortilla soup which she complained was a bit too salty, and I got the two taco plate. There was also a oily smell in the restaurant, but other than that and the salty soup the experience was nice."}
{"text":"Decent atmosphere, but grossly overpriced for the area. Drinks weak and pricey.  service dicey. Would not go there again!"}
{"text":"Always a good to go place. We have not had a bad meal here ever.  Always fresh and spiced right. Rice is great."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been here several years and is part of a local chain. I usually order the pollo con el arroz: chicken, rice, refried beans a salad with tortillas.  It is ordinary fare for a Mexican restaurant in the USA. The decor is fancy and you pay for it.
Today a group of us went for a luncheon meeting. $9.35 for two eggs on tortilla with rice, refried beans and a so-so salad. There was a mix up in the orders and one order was forgotten. The waiter got our bills throughly confused and tried to double charge some people. Maybe partly because he was using a black note pad instead of a regular order pad. We had to chase him down to get our bills too. this is the first time we had such poor service here."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Mexican food I have ever had, and I love Mexican food. Great service too!"}
{"text":"After a long, hard  day the pi√±a colada and smiling wait staff were just the thing to sweeten my mood.  My boyfriend was not feeling good and wanted soup.  He said the albondigas was excellent, just what the doctor ordered.  Mole sauce is one of my specialties so I seldom order it when we eat out.  But like I said I needed sweet so I did order mole enchiladas and was not disappointed.  Rich, spicy yum.  It came with choice of meat and so I tried shredded beef instead of the usual  chicken.  We had great service and great food; I left way happier than I entered."}
{"text":"Gringos and immigrants will love this place.  Food is excellent.  Especially recommend Anytime Platter for pickup catering at home.  Feeds 15 adults beautifully.  Accommodating staff.  Relaxed ambience.  A jewel of a place.  Our favorite Mexican restaurant in the Rogue Valley!"}
{"text":"What a GREAT Mazatlan Mexican restaurant.  Muy delicioso.  Extremely generous portions, believe me, about the size of two regular-sized dinner plates.  This is a very beautiful restaurant with wonderful authentic Mexican food.  The service couldn't be better. 

The night we were there they had a singer/guitarist, Brandon Dannals, who was spectacular.  He sang gorgeous songs in Spanish including my favorite, Besame Mucho.  

What a lovely evening."}
{"text":"Four of us arrived a half hour before closing and we were the only ones there. Juan was an attentive server and provided drinks and dinner in a very timely manner. He was so happy we were there and just couldn't do enough for us. The meals were chili relleno, vegetable chicken soup, shrimp and a taco salad. All very good. Margaritas were good as well. We ended up leaving 20 minutes past closing but there was no pressure for us to hurry and leave. A very pleasurable experience. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Si Casa Ramos is a great I-5 stop when driving between California and Oregon, but, judging by quantity of locals we see here, it is also a great Ashland/Medford dining option. 
Located in a typical strip mall right next to a highway, this gem almost feels hidden. Inside, the decor is elegant and uplifting, with bright colors, tiles and mock walls to make you feel like you just arrived in tropical Mexivo.
We ordered top shelf margaritas and their nacho appetizer. Both were delicious. For our meal we had burritos, one veggie and one asada. The veggie burrito had grilled vegetables and a nice mix of beans, sauce, cheese,  guoc and sour cream. The Asada burrito had tender strips of meet with the same insides. 
This was our second time stopping here, and better than the first.  We will definately visit again."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch on our way up to Portland.  Such a pleasant surprise!  Probably the best restaurant  salsa I've had but it was a bit too spicy for my son.  The enchiladas were incredibly good.  Great service as well."}
{"text":"Saturday night and another great meal. Had arroz con pollo - hubby had combo enchilada and shredded beef tostada with avocado - top shelf Cadillac marguerita on the rocks was tasssstttyyy!!  Thank you Susanna for her great service!
I wrote 2 weeks ago about the great service I received from Marco- hmm, somehow that review is no longer there?! While in the restaurant with huge parties celebrating someone's 50th birthday, Marco took care of so many customers including our table, with efficiency and genuine kindness that was most impressive. Our meal was excellent and the tortilla soup appetizer was very tasty."}
{"text":"Wow such a surprise.... Saw 1-3 stars but the front desk suggested this restaurant ... Great suggestion!  Hot crispy chips & delicious salsa.  Had their pork tamale & beef taco with Mexican rice.... Large portions, lots of meat in entrees.  Nice decor and friendly staff.  We will be back during our 4 day stay. All four of us enjoyed our mail"}
{"text":"Ordered special 9.95 was charged 14.95 -  this was on 2 orders. He just apologized but no offer to honor order. So a $20.00 meal ended up $30.00 
It was cold and uncomfortable had to wear our coats on our shoulders. 
Will never go to any Si Casa Flores again. The food was so so."}
{"text":"For Mexican food on the American side, Si Casa Flores is the place to be. One of three in the valley, however, the Phoenix location has the best chef and the best service by far.

I have tried the other locations, good, but they don't compare to the Phoenix location."}
{"text":"Almost always order \"Super Nachos Ole\" and never disappointed. Great food and friendly staff make it a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Great service! Beautiful decor with murials of mayan/aztec temples, Jaguars and Leopards. Was clean and larger inside than I thought. The waitresses are VERY attentive but sometimes too much. I have a food allergy and they were really good about getting my order correct snd answering all of my questions about ingredients. So glad they were patient with me. :) I can't have tomato, lemon, lime, orange, coconut, pineapple. In a mexican restaurant....can you imagine? Lol! But I went here on Valentine's Day with my hubby. He enjoyed his meal. Salsa was really good he said. I was able to eat the tortilla chips and beans which was nice but none of their appetizers. I was limited to their seafood menu or a burger. :/ I ordered the Seafood Chimicanga. The first couple bites were really good but it was way too FISHY and strong like it wasn't fresh. Gave me a bellyache. Definitely not worth the $14.95 for my meal. After I left I felt nauseous. But their Sopapillas were good for under $5. My hubby said he likes the mexican restaurant in Ashland better. I forget the name but it is on the main street, Siskiyou I think. I never tried it. So as a whole it is good if you order mexican food but avoid the SEAFOOD! ;)"}
{"text":"Food was great! Came in at 11:30 for lunch. My dad and I were the only customers. Got seated immediately. Came back 2 minutes later and asked if we were ready to order yet. Definitely needed some waters so we asked if we could have a couple cups of water while we decided. Ordered our food and got it very quickly. The waitress then stood up the register until we were done. Not one time did she ask us if everything was ok or if we needed refills. The cups were empty when she brought the food out. 2nd time in a row this has happened. She then started to complain to us about the new help that they just hired was not doing good. Imagine that!!!  Lead by example Lady !! You should be more worried about yourself."}
