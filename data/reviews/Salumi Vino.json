{"text":"I regularly go to Salumi Vino for different occasions. I really enjoy the food and am enamoured with the wine list and the recommendations that are presented.

My recommendations for lunch are the grilled tuna salad. For an evening meal I really enjoyed for appetizer the gnocci or scallop carpaccio (why not both!). For the main dish I either go for the Shrimp Linguini Fra Daviolo or the Black Cod dish."}
{"text":"Italian food done right!  My husband and I discovered this place about 5 years ago while walking around Old Montreal.  We are frequent visitors to Montreal and return to this restaurant every time.  Mike is an amazing chef and the owner Mario is great too!  
You must try the awesome ricotta gnocchi in truffle cream sauce, so light and delicious.  The veal meatballs are tasty as well.  Honestly, everything that we have ever eaten here is wonderful.  Mario brings in fresh burrata from Italy that is served on toasted bread with tomato, a great starter.
It's not in the heart of the touristy area but it's worth the walk towards the end of Notre-Dame near the corner of Bonsecour."}
{"text":"Myself and a friend went to Salumi on Friday evening and we really enjoyed ourselves. It was a freezing cold night but Salumi was warm and cozy, very inviting. 
We hat 3 appetizers, the Salumi charcuterie plate, the gnocchi with black truffle sauce and the calamari. 
The Salumi plate was delicious. We really enjoyed the selection of cured meats and they olives excellent. This plate came with bread and oil and vinegar. It would have been nice to have some more olives or other pickled accoutrements with the plate but overall we really enjoyed this.
The GNOCCHI!!! I never knew gnocchi could be so good. It was phenomenal. I really wanted to lick the plate. The gnocchi was light and fluffy and the sauce was delicious. I will go back just for that sauce
The calamari was perfect. Light batter, not to greasy and cooked well. This was not your overcooked, chewy mess that calamari can be. This was great.
We had two glassed of red each, picked by our waiter. His picks were perfect and the wine was delicious.
The waiter was very nice and friendly, helpful but not pushy.
I will be going back!"}
{"text":"Arrived for our 8pm reservation expecting a sophisticated atmosphere but encountered what I would liken to a preschool. There were truly more children under the age of 5 than adults despite the website stating no children under 10. Service and food were mediocre. Fell far below my expectations."}
{"text":"My husband and I love the restaurant. Mario is terrific and the food is so delicious. We go very often and always bring friends who appreciate good food. Salumi Vino is a fantastic evening of dining and relaxing!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say that my most recent dinner was not as good as the previous several times I've eaten here. The last few times that I've been for dinner, there have been only one or two parties dining. I've found that they do more business during lunch. 

Anyway, the food quality was not up to par, which was a shame because I had previously been so impressed. We asked to have the beef tartare, and were told that the menu had changed and \"there was no red meat in the restaurant\", which is bizarre.

The zucchini arrived cold, the croutons for the salmon tartare were burnt, and waitress recommended a wine that she discovered was not in stock. The gnocchi was still as good as ever, though. This is a pity because my guest was an out-of-town foodie who I wanted to introduce this gem of a restaurant to."}
{"text":"This is the worst place in Montreal. We've been to many restaurants in the last week and we were welcomed to each and any one of them. The owner didn't agree to sit us telling us there is no space where the restaurant is empty. I was with my son and wife and we're asked to leave. No good for kids as the initial suggestion said and no good at all. Highly not recommended!!!"}
{"text":"It was just so so. Nothing special and way overpriced. The service was lacking as well.  They ran out of desserts. Not a restaurant I would go back to."}
{"text":"We visited from out of town and loved everything about salumi vino! Great atmosphere, food, and service. Everything was spot on from the plate of meats and cheeses, the homemade pasta and gnocchi, to the tiramisu for dessert. We were completely impressed and satisfied with our dinner, and will certainly be back during our next trip!!"}
{"text":"Lovely atmosphere and friendly servers. The food is just ok. Too saucy and salty. Nothing that special, starting with the stale white bread. It was ok but we won't be back."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner yesterday. There was hair in our food, as an apology, we received limoncello, great. Food was mediocre pasta was overdone. Also very overpriced, we paid 60+ for a meal with wine, shared starters and pasta for each.

Most importantly, my friend told the waitress she was severely allergic to dairy. The waitress was kind about it and went to the kitchen multiple times to check. We left the restaurant and my friend had a major allergic reaction, having to use her asthma medication. This means that it wasn't just a dash of cheese that went in to her food. The dish she had definitely had dairy. How disrespectful. I would never pay another dime."}
{"text":"Food was good but not great. Order 3 dishes and 2 were ok and 1 was delicious. The Cavatelli con Caciocavallo sauce was watery. Not much tomato sauce flavour and the Gnocchi Tartufati was a little rubbery. But the Rotolo Rosé and Chilean Sauvignon Blanc delicious. The presentation of the the food was blah. It took 20 minutes after we were seated until the owners of the restaurant came to take our drink order. As well took forever to order our meals and cheque from him. As far as we can see the owner was the only waiter and one bus person assisting him with serving salt, pepper, water and bread. She did her job efficiently but we felt the owner was spread pretty thin due. I think I over tipped considering the service."}
{"text":"This place is so flavorful that it leaves you wanting more. I'm a big fan of truffle oils and it's perfectly used here on many of their dishes. They have a gnocchi with mushrooms and truffle that melts in your mouth. I could eat a full plate portions are huge, wine list is nice and the owner greets you at the door. Feel the passion and love for their food. It's a great experience. I recommended it."}
{"text":"Wow, now this is Italian food! In full disclosure, I met Mario yesterday in order to do some contract work for him, and as soon as I sat down, I had fresh water by the bottle at my finger tips, and an appetizer plate of creamy, handmade gnocchi to taste. It was rich, simple, and absolutely clean and gorgeously made. 

At the end of the evening, I was getting up to head home, and Mario asked me to sit back down. Out came a plate of amazing pasta in garlic sauce, with flavourful, thinly-sliced sausage and rapini. I ate the whole bowl as slow as my desire would allow, because I needed to savour the awesome. 

GO HERE!"}
{"text":"We did not find this place in Yelp - we just walked by and loved the outside deck.  We had an excellent lunch and enjoyed a glass of wine outside.  The interior was also nicely styled - comfortable in Summer and cozy in Winter.  We had large lunch salads and desserts.  All excellent.  Service was nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Stuzzichi is an excellent Italian restaurant we found while walking the streets of Old Montreal. It is a small bistro-like place with perhaps a dozen tables and an small open kitchen. Warm interior, with rock finish on most walls and a wine closet in the back corner. 

The food was very fresh and tasty. The lentil soup special was flavorful and my very generous portion of seafood risotto was packed with fresh clams, mussels, shrimp, squid and topped with a small lobster tail. My fellow diners' lamb and veal dishes were also well prepared and appropriately spiced. 

We enjoyed the $18 house red wine and the complimentary bruscetta that preceded the meal. Excellent, attentive service and no significant misses to mention. I would look forward to eating there again."}
{"text":"Great place, had a perfect bison bavette accompanied with mushrooms with a touch of wine vinegar. Just the meal I needed. Very welcoming place, Mario knows his business. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Salami Vino is the current name of this amazing little find. I had the rabbit, which was the chef's suggestion, & boy I'm glad he did! Amazing flavours and the Parmesan mashed potatoes really added some complexity to the dish. 
Met both the chef & the owner, & both were really down to earth & helpful. This is a locally owned & operated restaurant...the real deal. Give the rabbit a try...you'll thank me! -Kevin"}
{"text":"Wow wow wow! What a wonderful place! Food is spectacular! Pasta was yammy! Pics attached! If you don't have an idea where to eat and want delish food! Come and indulge! Place is not huge , you can even watch your food prepare at the kitchen ( half of it is open). They do have outdoor seating . Full bar! Very pleased!"}
{"text":"Four of us for dinner on a Friday night. Everything we had was great. The burata was magnificent as was the zucchini friti. The side of mushrooms was the best we ever ate, if your a shroom fan you are missing out if you don't try them. A very good wine selection makes it easy to find the right wine at your price point. 
You can't go wrong on this restaurant."}
{"text":"Just had amazing gnocchi the sauce was amazing and the chicken dish was delicious!  Braised beef was awesome with fresh pasta! Everything came so fast!  Great service and friendly waiter.  The owner Mario was super nice!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I were looking to find a great place to eat for our anniversary, and did we make a great choice! 

My fiancé had rigatoni with mushrooms, while I had the ravioli with pumpkin seeds, sundried tomato, and a pesto sauce.  The owner was awesome and took the time to know us better.   

This was not only the best food we had during our stay in Montreal but some of the best Italian food I've ever had."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service. 

We went here on a Sunday evening and the atmosphere was superb. 

The pasta is very, very good."}
{"text":"We arrived for a family dinner on a Friday night and the staff could not have been more gracious and welcoming. The menu was wonderful, and the selection of appetizers was especially enticing. We tried the oyster mushrooms, which were delicious, as well as the zucchini fritters and the calamari. We all enjoyed all three of them, even the teenagers. They easily accommodated an egg allergy in our group and spoke excellent English. Every main dish was also delicious, and the homemade pasta was especially appreciated. We did not stay for dessert, as the meal was very filling. There is an extensive wine list, and the food is prepared in the open kitchen. The food is very authentic Italian, and we highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Salumi casa charcuterie board was outstanding. Veal meatball is perfectly cooked and presented in a rich tomato sauce. Very nice place and priced well for the quality and selection.  Would ansolutely return."}
{"text":"We found this lovely little place on Yelp because it was right around the corner from our hotel. We arrived in Montreal rather late in the day and didn't want to go too far on such a chilly night. When we entered the restaurant, we were greeted by our host and server, Jack, who was pleasant and efficient throughout the entire meal. After perusing the menu for a few minutes, my friend and I had decided what we wanted to drink. Still, I thought I'd ask Jack's opinion. He inquired if I knew what I wanted for dinner, and since I had pretty much decided on the ravioli with pumpkin and asparagus, I told him. He said I had made an excellent choice with the Syrah. So we ordered both dinner and drinks, also adding the gnocchi as an appetizer. Long dinner, short, neither the meal nor the service disappointed. Had we not been so intent on trying as many restaurants as possible on our four day trip, we would have gone back again. And we definitely will next time!"}
{"text":"This is a late review but this restaurant is worth it. Four of us were at Salumi Vino for F1 weekend and we were lucky enough to get a table on Friday night. The staff treated us like visiting VIPs but I suppose they do that to everyone. We started with a charcuterie plate that was incredible - we asked the server to pair a wine with what we were having and he nailed it. 

Next, the chef sent over some black truffle gnocchi for the table to sample and I still remember my eyes rolling back in my head..... that was incredible. Later we got a second bottle of wine and I had the lobster fettuccine and it was nothing short of amazing- the fact that there is only one chef in the kitchen and all of our dishes came out at the same time and piping hot was awesome. This is one of the two best Italian places I've ever been. The only place that comes close is a restaurant in Issaquah, WA that is also amazing - but for the best Italian in Montreal, Salumi Vino is the place."}
{"text":"Service was flawless & exceptional. Food was okay but definitely not 5 stars. Large portions. Open kitchen and location added favourably to the experience. We came for the scallops but there were none on the menu. Call first if this is your main reason for choosing this place."}
{"text":"Came up to Montreal with a group of 10 heavy eaters. Chef recommended family style and needless to say, we were all well fed. Food was delicious, service was excellent. Our waiter recommended a good wine that was enjoyed by all. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Had a quick dinner there last night with friends. It was impromptu nothing organized, but decided to just share appetizers amongst us - great decision.

Mario suggested the gnocchi which was light, creamy and delicious - which isn't easy to do with gnocchi. The fried calamari was done just right and the eggplant was just sumptuous - but my favorite was the burrata bruschetta - I've had this done before at another restaurant years ago - but have longed for it since - no longer! It's simple, but it's a perfect blend of cheese and tomato and olive oil - mmm.

Great spot if you want to head into Old Montreal for sightseeing as it's just outside the chaos of Place Jacques Cartier square."}
{"text":"Came in out of the cold on a January evening for a glass of wine.  We had eaten recently and weren't hungry but we we decided to try a plate of salumi with our wine. It was delicious and the service was friendly and efficient. As we watched meals being delivered to other patrons we wished we were hungry. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Great spot for dinner....wonderful service and food.  Mario is a fantastic host and the other guests eating dinner at the bar made for a fantastic experience.  It was my first visit to Salumi Vino and I will be sure to return when I come back to Montreal.  Great food, wine, service and company - you will NOT be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Wtf Montreal!?? I really don't understand the hype. Ok food, bad slow service. Waiter was chewing gum when taking orders,  totally disinterested in answering our questions. The gnocchi was chewy. Drinks were fine, as was the pasta hence the 2 stars. Too bad that I chose this place for one of my few nights in the city."}
