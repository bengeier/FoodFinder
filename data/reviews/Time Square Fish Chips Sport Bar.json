{"text":"Nice neighbourhood restaurant with friendly staff and a patio too.  Prices are cheap and they have daily specials.   I've been several times.  Food can be a bit hit and miss - Belgian waffles can be very good, hamburger steak was a bit of  a miss and the fish and chips were ok."}
{"text":"This is a great spot. The staff is great and the food is even better. Please do not be discouraged by the lack of reviews or poor reviews. 

This bar has billiards, darts, karaoke, and plenty of tvs and seating. Very reasonable prices on food and drinks too. 

If you're in the area definitely swing in and give this place a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Better than you could expect! Great service, reasonable prices, good food, beer, TV's, what else do you need? Nice neighborhood mom/pop type place.
Good Philly cheesesteak and fish & chips! Quiet, clean, and you can just hang out :)"}
{"text":"1 1/2 - 2 star, I am sad to say... Giving them a 2 here because the food was good but the service was not as good. I have been to this restaurant maybe 3 times, ever, and the service was unfortunately not that good on this date. There weren't many people in the restaurant, although 2 or 3 tables filled up while we were there.

Breakfast was delicious, so the chef is good! But it was supposed to come with a free refill on coffee. I asked for a top up but the waitress splashed a few drops at the end of the pot into my cup but did not and would not make a new pot to bring us any more! She had a long face on this day.  Maybe she was just having a bad day. 

The best part for me was seeing my friend. Sounds like the place has been going downhill over time, based on the service, which is a shame, because the food is good. According to my friend who lives close to here, the service has been spiraling down for a while now - they used to do Karaoke nights but they just can't be bothered to set it up, so they've lost clientelle."}
