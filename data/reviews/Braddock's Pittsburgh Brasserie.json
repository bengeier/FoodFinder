{"text":"Braddock's American Brasserie is an attractively decorated restaurant, with good acoustics, a well-priced  menu and hearty portions.
Three of us had  the salad topped with a good sized crab cake; 
the side order of french fries was delicious!  the steak with frites also good.

The one downside: the wait staff worked hard but at times  seemed distracted or inexperienced, at one point  forgetting a plate and then  neglecting to ask if anyone wanted dessert or coffee before presenting the bill."}
{"text":"We went before a play at Heinz Hall. We were greeted warmly and received quick and friendly service from Michael. I had the pot roast pierogies and two selections from the bar, Braddock's Smash and a Sazerac. I was pleased with all of them. The architecture of the building that holds the restaurant is also worth checking out. I will be getting frites next time so I don't have to steal my sisters. Very convenient to the downtown theaters. I plan to return again."}
{"text":"Stopped at their bar for a pre-dinner drink on a busy Saturday evening. While it did take a little bit too long for the bar tender to notice us and ask us what we wanted to drink, the drinks he made were excellent. Neither my husband or I could decide on what to get so he asked for our likes and dislikes and made us a drink on the spot.  Both were very delicious

We loved the decor and atmosphere of the lobby where the bar is located and will stop back for food sometime too!"}
{"text":"Beautiful spot that makes you feel as you are in a \"see and be seen\" crowd while having an intimate experience.  Ambience is stunning.  Great spot for taking a \"staying in town\" vacation.  Date and I both had the scallops which were presented fabulously.  Waitress Autumn was very sweet and attentive even for a busy Saturday.  She made us feel right at home.   Very accommodating for our 8 pm curtain time as well.  Host staff was very pleasant as well."}
{"text":"Went last night after a shown downtown. Atmosphere was amazing. The wait staff and bartenders were quick and attentive. The food was amazing! I got salmon, and couldn't stop eating it. The only reason for 4 stars is the menu is limiting so look before you go. - but if you want to try something new, this is the place. And the whiskey list is awesome, good prices for a huge selection. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Overall, Braddocks is what you expect from a fine hotel restaurant.  The food was very good.  The service was a bit slow (likely due to a large conference and several early diners).  In addtion, our server and expediter and had to \"auction\" some of the dishes.  Lastly, our final bill had several errors on it.  Even though we were a group of 6+, we should not have had the billing errors.  The staff did eagerly correct the issues.  Otherwise, we had an enjoyable time and would return on a future visit."}
{"text":"My server was super slow! I had a burger which was very good. The fries here are great. My wife had a (sliced) chicken salad and the chicken was way under cooked. This should have been noticed since it was cut into slices. Unfortunately the server didn't come back to check on us until everyone was done. Overall I'm disappointed, especially for the price point."}
{"text":"I had the lobster gnocchi and it was fabulous. Rarely have I actually had gnocchi done so well. The service was fast and impeccable as well.  Every time I thought about an order a server was there.  I can't believe this restaurant is attached to a hotel!

Edit: I read some poor reviews on the service that I did not experience. I don't know if they have changed the staff or if that problem crops up more at very busy times but I had excellent service."}
{"text":"I always stop here before and/or after a show downtown. Michael the bartender is an alcohol wizard, you'll be blown away by the cocktails he makes. The food is great as well, I recently tried their charcuterie board for the first time and I don't really like lunch meat but it was delicious. Top recommendation is a sazerac and the burger."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a post Pirate game beer last night. I ordered an IPA and sat down at the bar. I couldn't wait to leave as the sour smell of stale beer and who knows  what wafted from the tap drains. Call bar rescue! 
The annoying lady with her cell phone pugged in at the bar didn't help my my experience either."}
{"text":"I would definitely go again. Great service, delicious food, and neat atmosphere of an old building. Super convenient if you are going to a theater performance."}
{"text":"Mediocre. Had the tuna tartar and it was a bit bland. It was with a mignonette but needed more acidity.Â  It is not a lively atmosphere, energy was low. But people like it bc it was pretty busy. Napkin stunk like mildew."}
{"text":"Had the arugula salad, short rib pirogues and kielbasa board. Salad was great. Pirogues were awesome. Kielbasa was outstanding.

I highly recommend the above."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. I have been there over ten times....It's on the ground floor of Renaissance hotel. The environment is very elegant and clean. The food is absolutely good. I always start with the mussels with fries, they will bring up a huge bowl of fresh and delicious mussels and crispy but soft fries. I wish they have sweet potato fries as well.
And all other dishes I tried was great. The scallops, the steak, seafood, pasta, everything. Strongly recommended."}
{"text":"Good local/regional beer selection.  Fantastic bourbon selection.  Great house-made Chips.  

If a person were to read my review of the Renaissance Pittsburgh Hotel they would see my reference to this bar, wherein one can have:

Fun
Laughs
Snacks
Conversation about Justin Bieber with Miss Samantha

Pretty much an all-around good time.  And I learned how to make a fruit fly trap with a wine bottle and a paper cone.  That knowledge in and of itself is worth coming to a bar and killing some drinks."}
{"text":"Took the fam for our one \"fancy\" dinner while in Pittsburgh, at the gorgeous Rennaissance Hotel.  The food was good, but the presentation a bit odd.  My beet salad was fresh and tasty, but I had to mix the ingredients myself: the beets and nuts were hiding underneath the lettuce, and the goat cheese and crab cake were sitting on the edges.  Also, the wait staff was perhaps a bit over-enthusiastic, even going so far as to suggest that my French onion soup was browned perfectly on top as it was being served.  
That being said, everything tasted good: the steak, the fish and chips, and especially the desserts!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent and ambiance is very nice. My wife had the filet mignon with mashed potatoes and she loved it. I had the park chop which was about 2 inches thick and tasted great. My daughter had the scallops with gnocchi  and that was prepared and tasted wonderful. The restaurant is located inside the Renaissance Hotel with very convenient parking right across the street."}
{"text":"Great. Tasty. Wonderful staff. 
Dinner- fancy menu. I had \"Poor man's\" lasagna with ricotta stuffed meatballs. Perfect. Covered in mozz cheese. Wish I hadn't filled up on the Mac n cheese balls app before, but those were great too. Had zero room for dessert. Waiter was so friendly, and cheerfully accepted a minor side substitution on my partner's \"perfect\" scallops dinner (smashed Yukon gold potatoes in place of polenta). Drinks were always topped off. Casual dress, but the staff are all pleasant and professional. Here on a Saturday before a Steelers game. Lots of fans around but the restaurant wasn't crowded at 730pm. The hotel lobby is beautiful.
Breakfast- big b-fast buffet with build your own omelette & waffle station. Game day. Most staff all in Steelers gear. Still very friendly but professional. Asked for \"well done\", crispy bacon which was spot on. 
Recommend. Will come back."}
{"text":"Braddock's was delicious! Excellent menu- it was very difficult to choose what to order!! As an appetizer I ordered the pierogies, and they are a MUST HAVE.  I will definitely be going back to try other things that I didn't order this time.  I went for my birthday, and they offered me either a complimentary dessert or cocktail.  I chose the cocktail, and it was great! I hope to go back soon!"}
{"text":"We had dinner before a show at the Benedum.  The food was fantastic.  We started with the pierogies which were stuffed with short ribs.  Certainly not the traditional pierogies but very good.  I had the gnocchi and lobster, half portion.  Absolutely delicious.  It is a very rich dish but the flavors were great.  The gnocchi was freshly made and the lobster was tender and sweet.  My friend had the poor man's lasagna.  Another awesome dish.  I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"My boyfriend's family was in town for Father's Day weekend, so I met up with them for a celebratory lunch. As others have mentioned, the restaurant is within the very fancy Renaissance Hotel, but fancy dress isn't required.

We had made reservations, but there was no need. The restaurant was quite empty around 1 pm on Father's Day, with only one or two other parties. We experienced the wonderful service other Yelpers described. Our waiter kept our water full, offered great suggestions, graciously answered questions (or went to the chef for an answer), and was very knowledgeable about the sources of the food,

We had a coupon for a free appetizer from the hotel, we we tried the kielbasa board. The presentation was beautiful. I loved trying the different types of kielbasa with all the different sauces. For my meal, I ordered The Pittsburgh Reuben (\"The Big Ugly\") with a salad (choice of salad or fries). The salad was fresh and satisfying, the sandwich (if you can even call it that) even more so. It's huge--two slices of bread piled with sauerkraut, Russian dressing, and shaved pastrami topped with kielbasa, a potato pierogi, and cheese. More of a knife-and-fork job than a sandwich. I ordered it because I wanted to try everything--it was a good choice. I wasn't able to finish half the plate, so I packed the rest up in a to-go box and it made a great dinner.

The components of the sandwich were great. My favorite part was the bread, which soaked up the juices from the toppings but was still still buttery and crisp on the outsides. However, the meatiness of the sandwich got a little overwhelming after a bit--I wish I'd saved my salad to accompany the sandwich.

The other members of the group greatly enjoyed their meals as well. Mussels and frites, the croque minargie... all were cleared and declared delicious. It was a great dining experience overall, and a nice way to celebrate."}
{"text":"Decent meal.  Service was great. We ordered a short rib pierogi which unfortunately was not cooked and greasy.   The porkchop wasn't bad for as big as it was!  Parts were amazing and it here's were dry.   The shrimp and scallops over risotto was a tad disappointing as I only received 2 shrimp and 2 scallops over a bowl of risotto. For that price I was expecting more.   Not a bad experience.  A but pricey but quality of food wasn't too bad."}
{"text":"Wasn't planning to go out but received the Open Table Pittsburgh Dining week email and became intrigued. After going through the list of restaurants we decided on Braddock's American Brasserie. The staff contacted me that day to confirm my reservations and was very helpful on the parking for the restaurant; they actually cover the valet parking should you decide to utilize it otherwise there is a garage across the street. 

The menu was very delightful as the choices of unusual dishes along with the standards which you would expect. The Chef's specials for the evening included a scallop dish which is my wife's favorite and a venison dish which for me peaked my interests. I have only had venison at a namely Pittsburgh restaurant and wasn't impressed by the dish. We started the meal with a couple gasses of wine and an appetizer special of lobster perogies (I'm a Burgh guy) which were delicious and just the right amount to share between my wife and I. My wife had the scallops which was cooked to perfection and delectable (yes we always share). I had the venison which to my surprise was done to perfection and served over a bed of beans and sauce that you had to dabble each bite of venison into appreciate all the flavors. The meat just fell apart as it was so tender and juicy. This is a must if you ever get the chance to be presented with the special do not pass it up. For our dessert we enjoyed a wonderful mix of berries, cinnamon ice cream and granola, yummy! The chef was nice enough to come out and ask how our meals were as he went from table to table making sure everyone was satisfied. He was so enjoyable to speak with as he explained how he made the venison so tender and juicy while giving it so much flavor. 

I would recommend this restaurant as the food was wonderful, the entire staff was great and the atmosphere was perfect for our Friday night out!"}
{"text":"Tried Braddock's for a second time, this time for dinner. Overall food was ok, fairly unspectacular especially considering the $80 bill for 2. 

Planned on ordering the Trenne Carbanera listed on their website but it was mysteriously absent from the menu upon arriving. Prices and descriptions are slightly off on several instances as well. Decided to go with the Amish Chicken and my date had the Steak Frites. As mentioned earlier food wasn't bad by any means, I've just had substantially better for far less a price tag. As far as descriptions go the chicken came with polenta, asparagus, onions, - as in nothing like what is described on their website. It's correct on the menu in the restaurant however so I did know what I was ordering at the time. 

Dessert was home-made smores - which isn't even listed on the web dessert menu. Again, just kinda meh. For $8 not exactly a splitable dessert portion wise either. 

I definitely left more satisfied from lunch and at a much smaller price tag and therefore will probably just stick to visiting for lunch every now and then or possibly order from the pub menu for dinner and not much else looks appetizing there. The Pittsburgh Rueben seems to be the only saving grace....."}
{"text":"We have been to the bar several times now and Michael is an excellent bartender.  He make creative and tasty drinks.  We come here when we come visit Pittsburgh, great bar, great conversion!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was nice as was the hotel lobby. I got the steak frites. First of all, these were fries, not frites. Frites are fried twice and these clearly were not. As fries, they were ok... Not good, not bad. The steak was cooked medium as ordered and was good, but was overpowered by some brown sauce. I'm a steak purist and believe a good cut can stand on it's own with little more than salt and pepper. This would have been better without the sauce.  Overall I give it a c+ or b-.  The short rib pierogies sound interesting. We had a groupon otherwise I would have preferred 6 Penn. At least they had east end brewing on tap.  I will give this place another try in the future."}
{"text":"A group of us went for dinner last night during Pittsburgh's fleeting \"restaurant week\" and was informed they had no more prix fixe restaurant week dinners.

I find this amazing considering it was the prime night of restaurant week, a Friday night, and they were no longer honoring their advertised special meal. 

The food was average at best, portions were Cheesecake Factory 'esque, the Charcuterie plate looked like someone dumped a pile of cold cuts right out of the package onto a cutting board, no care given to the presentation of food whatsoever. 

All in all it was a sad experience, wouldn't recommend going."}
{"text":"Update! The manager of Braddock's sent me a very kind email, apologizing for the service and issues we had during our experience at Braddock's. Simply because of this I would be willing to give it another shot. Everyone has an off day and I think highly that he took the time to contact me about my not so great experience."}
{"text":"The food is so-so and is severely overpriced for the caliber of the food they serve.  Their runners don't time the food right and even the waiter/waitress that waits on you doesn't even remember who ordered what. They call this place an American brasserie but this is fake French at best, and even that is a bit of an insult if you'd ask a French chef to taste their food. Don't get me wrong.  The food here is good, but thats the problem - It's not 'excellent' , 'mouthwatering' or 'to die for'. It's just ok good.  It's not worth what they charge, and if you're looking for good French, this place definitely isn't it.  With that being said, the ambiance and decor are superb. The mixed drinks are tasty and they don't jip you on the alcohol.  I suppose I expected a lot more out of a restaurant in the upscale Renaissance Hotel near the theatres, where a lot of out-of-towers may frequent. Surely, you wouldn't want this place to showcase Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Excellent execution of custom dish to deliciously accommodate several food allergies. Best mashed potatoes I ever had, and I've had some great ones. Perfectly cooked seared scallops with delectable sauce and beautiful presentation. Large portions, so could not finish and have leftovers to look forward to.  Excellent gluten free flourless chocolate cake with strip of candied bacon atop. Lovely and very helpful staff. Kudos to all for making dining out a pleasure even with food restrictions."}
{"text":"I have to say the food was good, but with any dining experience the server has a lot to do with it. We made reservations for 6 for my sister's birthday and advised we were bringing a small cake and the hostess stated that was not a problem. We arrive on time and were seated promptly at 7. There was only one other party in the restaurant, but for a Tuesday night in Pgh I didn't think much of it. I asked the hostess if she could put our cake in the freezer since it was an ice cream cake and she happily agreed and took it. Five minutes later our waitress comes back with the cake and states that \"they have a policy at Braddock's that no one can bring in a cake or wine and if they do they are charged $15 for Braddock's to hold it kinda like a corking fee\". I have been to several BYOB restaurants and I understand the corking fee. The waiters open the wine for you, pour it, and keep it on ice if necessary. Not the case with a BIRTHDAY CAKE.  After dinner she brought the cake out and placed in on the table in front of my sister, the birthday girl, and did not even take it out of the box. So what was the $15 fee for exactly? She did not serve us; she literally walked 10 steps to the kitchen and brought it out. I guess we were paying their electricity bill since they put it in the freezer four and hour? I will never enter this horrid establishment again. As someone who works in the downtown area and frequents restaurants for working lunches and dinners I was hoping I could add Braddock's to my list of go to spots, sadly it has ended up in my I rather eat fast food then ever eat here again category.  Lastly, the whole time we were there (2.5 hrs) only four other people came in the restaurant. So it can't be just us that figured out this place needs new management asap!"}
{"text":"Most important observation: you can't afford wine here, it will literally double the price of your meal.  Their markup is through the roof.

Second, sadly: the food is really, really good, but largely overshadowed by their insane wine prices (for non-drinkers, this place is the real deal.)

Third, noise from the hotel lobby is constant and invasive, and particularly bad on the evening I dined here because a wedding had spilled over into the public areas.

Finally, what they call kielbasa is a big hot dog (the best I ever tasted, prepared perfectly and served with great mustard and kraut, but NOT kielbasa).  I know, I know, technically the term kielbasa can refer to damn near any sausage, but as a Polish American I know that what I was served was NOT kielbasa - delicious, but taking the argument to its extreme, I'd also be pissed off if I ordered a slice of pie and got a bowl of bread pudding (even if it was the best bread pudding ever.)"}
{"text":"We ate here about 6 months ago and had a nice experience and then again last night and really enjoyed it. As you think about going here, you really don't want to eat in a hotel (Renaissance) restaurant and feel like it can't possibly be good but give it a try. It is extremely convenient for hitting before a show next door at the Byham or across the street at the Heinz.

We intended to try the Streetside bar/ restaurant but it was packed out so went to the full restaurant. Gotta say, we really like the ambience in the lobby and restaurant - soft lighting, good colors, inviting sofas/ chairs, and never much noise at all.  We were promptly seated, and the server was friendly and never intrusive.

The food is moderately expensive (a hotel after all) but is VERY well presented, excellent portions, and was all very tasty. 

They have lots of coupons/ deals out there, so if you can find one of those and stop by before a show, this is a nice, unexpected place."}
{"text":"I think this place is 2.5 stars but I rounded up to 3. The service was incredibly slow and once the food arrived it was... OK. Nothing memorable. The only thing that stood out was the Whiskey Rebellion story on their newspaper menu and the fact that we were there three times longer than we needed to be due to slow service. The restaurant was not packed."}
{"text":"Ate here just before the Chicago Concert in Heinz Hall last Sunday.

Fantastic service, very nice interior and ambiance.

The food was great: Goat Cheese and beet salad was great, shrimp cocktail huge(!!) and properly cooked, Filet super tender and tasty (if only very slightly over cooked), Spinach and Mushroom Couscous was filling and delicious.

Rachel C is definitely right here -- this is not your typical hotel restaurant. Everything was done right, great premium ingredients, oh and let's not forget those cocktails.

Both the Prohibition Pear(Grey goose Le Poire / St Germaine / Lillet Blanc / Lime / Simple Syrup) and the Braddock Smash(Maker's Mark / Fresh Berries / House made Sour / Bitters) were awesome.

The wine list had affordable wines both by the glass and by the bottle.

Overall, the prices are high(about $140 for two including (5) drinks, tax, generous tip) --- but this was a top notch dinner, top notch service, great ambiance.

I'd go back there in a second.  Next time, I will order the 18oz bone-in ribeye!

Expensive?  Yes.

Great Value for your money?  Definitely.

Do we deserve a special night away from the kids? You bet your....ummm, butt."}
{"text":"I had dinner with my son and his friend there last night. One word- incredible. My beet and goat cheese salad was a meal in itself but the scallops and polenta left me wanting to lick the plate. My son had the bisque and pasta special and his friend, the gnocchi and lobster. Nothing was left. Can't wait to return!!!!"}
{"text":"Hit or Miss? I've been here about 4 times in the last year, equally split with good and not so good, both in food and/or service. If there's a show that night, the place is busy, if it is a weekend, the place is busy. If it is a random Tuesday at 6:00, you might be the only people there. The specialty cocktails, albeit $10 are really wonderful, the Braddock Smash and Braddock's Revenge w jalapeno are our top 2.

The bread they deliver is hot and crusty served with sea salt topped butter - can't ever go wrong there. Mussels are good, they come with crusty bread for the leftover broth. As for the beet/goat cheese salad, the 1st 2 times it was amazing, last time the beets were undercooked and the greens weren't dressed enough. But each time the fried goat cheese is the highlight! I've had steak & frites, spot on, tender and the sauce complimented it well. I've has the lobster gnocchi twice, generous hunks of lobster in a cream sauce with peas and asparagus, it's really, really, really good. I recommend a half order with a salad :)

We've tried the ribeye, it was okay, it did take forever to come out. Last visit the sea scallops - were great portions and the polenta was yummy, but the scallops had a metallic taste, they brought a 2nd order, also metallic taste, also lacked that crust that a seared scallop should have. From home cooking scallops we have learned that all scallops are not equal and some come treated with STP a chemical preservative added to fresh scallops on the boat. Frozen scallops or 'dry' scallops do not have this added and will not pull a metallic taste. Sometimes people without sensitive tongues might not even notice a difference. STP also causes a scallop to absorb more water, hence losing the ability to get a crust. Really though, you can't blame it on the chef. It's the scallops fault, or whoever the supplier is. 

All in all, we won't stop going, it is a pleasant atmosphere, convenient to everything downtown and generally a great experience! I'd still recommend it to friends."}
{"text":"Went in solely for the French Onion soup and it did not disappoint. It was absolute perfection and everything you would want from a French onion soup. I sat at the bar on a snowy afternoon and it was wonderful. Will definitely be back to test out the rest of the menu when I am back in town."}
{"text":"I enjoy hotel bars as much as the next person: a necessary but not ideal part of life. Braddock's has everything you could want of such a bar. Good, surprisingly inexpensive drinks, including a nice selection of microbrews on tap. A nice atmosphere, including some comfortable couches and a great classic tile floor. Drunken conference travelers. Men loudly explaining things to their younger colleagues. Sloshed local theater goers staying at the hotel for the night. As such, I'm giving Braddock's the highest possible rating I'd give, for a hotel bar."}
{"text":"I went for lunch while in town on work and it was DEAD but I'd heard good things. I got the croque Marin with fries. The sandwich was HUGE and the cheese was melted a good two inches around the bread! I easily had two meals out of it, and I'm an eater. I left beyond stuffed. And the prices were beyond reasonable for the location and size of the meal - I think $12. Don't be alarmed if you're the only one there, the food doesn't suffer!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to this restaurant for an early Valentine's Day dinner.  We had the prix fixe dinner and it was good but not great.  It was a three course dinner with a lobster encrote salad, petite filet with crab legs, mashed potatoes and asparagus, and a dessert sampler.  The portions were ample and the ambiance is very nice.  It has that old hotel feeling.  The service is really good and attentive.  The fried mushroom risotto is quite tasty.  It wasn't toe-curling but the good service more than made up for the uninspired food."}
{"text":"Ate there tonight. 
Meatless pasta pretty bland and overpriced for box penne pasta and a little vegetables and sauce. Ice cream dessert was badly crystalized with ice, like it's been sitting in the freezer for a very long time. 
Overall pretty disappointing. 
Server was friendly. 
Place was really slow--very few tables."}
{"text":"This review is for the bar of this restaurant.  Date and time of visit:  May 20, afternoon.  

This restaurant is in the Renaissance Hotel and the restaurant closes in the afternoon.  That's why we ended up at the bar.

The ambiance:  The bar is by the lobby and the lobby is the best place to be during a hot day.  Here's a look:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/braddocks-american-brasserie-pittsburgh?select=jdVKRjnFD1_4xF_x-9OnIg#jdVKRjnFD1_4xF_x-9OnIg


The drinks:  My sister loved their Cosmo cocktail but she said that it is not unusual since Pittsburgh has excellent bartenders.  My Chardonnay was not shabby either. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/braddocks-american-brasserie-pittsburgh?select=jdVKRjnFD1_4xF_x-9OnIg#_Ty0CSROdhF_-_96dPjKbA


The food:   You could order appetizers from the bar.  I particularly loved the Belgian fries and its dip. We also had Roasted Tomato Soup with Lardons (French bacon), Braised Short Rib Pierogies ( Polish dumplings similar to the Italians' ravioli) with creamed leek sauce, and Goat Cheese & Red Pepper Bruschetta. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/braddocks-american-brasserie-pittsburgh?select=jdVKRjnFD1_4xF_x-9OnIg#Myp6idkB98z3gOVlSFCiGg

For dessert, we shared the Warmed Brownie with Banana Marshmallow, Salted Caramel, Candied Walnuts, a la mode."}
{"text":"This is the hotel bar / restaurant at the Renaissance.  It has two separate sections - one a side bar and one the main dining room on opposite sides of the hotel.  Our group stopped in at the side bar to have a drink.  They probably had 6-7 beers on tap.  Not sure on prices as I didn't pick up the bill.  Service was friendly enough.  I was surprised how empty it was when we were there."}
{"text":"Stayed at the Renaissance last night so decided to try Braddocks. Strange atmosphere.  Somewhat like a waiting room. Decor is tired. Staff were amazing, knowledgeable and attentive without being intrusive. Appetizers (crab cakes and short rib pierogies) were excellent.  My partners main course more disappointing. Salmon on a beret salad. Huge portion but. Salad dominated by greens and salmon over cooked.  My hanger steak and frites was excellent. I like it medium, ordered medium rare and it came medium!!  Tating is overall 3.  My food would rate 4 my partner's 3 and atmosphere 3."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday evening while in Pittsburgh recently. I had done some searching on Yelp and Open Table as we wanted a reservation for our party of 5. Parking was also an important decision element and you can get free valet for up to 4 hours at the hotel. We weren't quite sure if the restaurant was inside the hotel or next door and when we arrived realized it was inside (there is a small bar with same name that is accessible from the street or the lobby too). We were promptly seated at a round table that was large yet intimate enough for our party. I wanted to try so many things that I opted to do a bit of a sampler approach versus having a full meal. I started with the onion soup gratinee, which has bourbon in it (an homage to the whiskey strength of the restaurant). It was a solid onion soup and a good sized portion. My mom and I split the spinach salad which comes with spinach, strawberries, spicy pecans, bleu cheese crumbles and a poppy seed vinaigrette. All of my favorite salad things in one salad and it was fresh and tasty! For my main, I had the braised short rib pierogies with creamed leeks. I had read about these on numerous \"top Pittsburgh pierogi\" lists, which was another reason I chose this restaurant. They were melt-in-your-mouth good. Fresh bread was brought to the table and we shared a bottle of wine (you'll need to ask for the bottle menu as they don't initially bring it out). We enjoyed ourselves - the ambiance was airy and historic. There were other diners, but it wasn't overly crowded and it wasn't overly noisy. Our server was attentive and helpful as others considered their menu choices. All in all, a solid place I'm a fan of and would recommend to others."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed by the lunch offerings and it appeared that most of downtown already knew this, considering the restaurant was completely empty during a Friday lunch service. That's unheard of at many other restaurants in town. I thought the menu was overpriced for what you were getting so I was hoping the quality would blow me away. Meh. 

I got the (tomato) soup and half (chicken) sandwich combo. The tomato soup tasted nearly identical to Panera's tomato soup, but with some bacon and a basil oil of some sort. While I enjoyed the soup, I couldn't justify the price when I could pay half for basically the same thing at Panera. The sandwich was okay. The sandwich toppings were good but the chicken was a bit dry. 

My lunch experience here was about average. I would consider coming back, but it probably wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"Amazing! Food was fantastic. A little pricey but well worth it. I had the pierogies for an appetizer, the risotto with meatballs for dinner and the red velvet pierogies for dessert. Everything was top notch, including the service. The manager even came by more than once to ask how things were. My friend that was with said everything was orgasmic; he had the filet mignon."}
{"text":"They went out of their way to fit us in (a party of 10) when there was some issue with Open Table reservation service.  Food was great, served properly and promptly.  Excellent place for a pre-theater meal."}
{"text":"We -party of 4 started with  crab cake & oysters on 1/2 shell as apps. The crab cake as promised, serious crab meat.  The oysters fantastic!!  Also had the tomato bisque, a small beet salad. Bisque delicious, Beet salad perfect w/ the goat cheese.
Mains were the hanger steak, entree portion of crab cakes and a spinach salad with grilled chicken.  Seriously, both orders of the hanger were cooked to order (med-rare) and delicious.
The crab cakes with lovely glazed carrots. Spinach salad/chicken very good.
Only fuss, too many fries with the steak. Very good fries but too, too many.
Overall, the prices for the generous portions very, very good. Service was super!!! Thank you Michelle!!! Cheers to the chef!!!
Big plus besides the food, service & price is the atmosphere. Gorgeous hotel, a gem. The decor, marble & stairs in the lobby incredible. Was nice, we got a table that gave us a view of the lobby. Loved that tables well spaced, no loud music, TV's.
Great  food,  service, elegant atmosphere, great prices!!!!!"}
{"text":"We had drinks and the short rib pierogies at the bar. Excellent service, fantastic food, and drinks. They were even kind enough to make me an off menu cocktail based on what I liked that was so good!"}
{"text":"Such a beautiful hotel.  So i had no idea that Braddock's was in the Renaissance.  They advertise a lot so maybe I just missed that fact.  I got the impression that Braddock's was a causal family restaurant but that's doesn't appear to be the case. (Think its the name, Braddock's). 

I stopped in here after a show for a quick glass of wine with a friend.  The selection was decent but a bit on the pricey side 10-14 a glass.  Only the small bar was busy the rest of restaurant was dead. 

Might stop back in for ONE drink if I am dressed up from a show but $14 glasses of wine aren't the reg for me."}
{"text":"Came here when we were in a rush before a show.  We made reservations, but the place was practically empty, which caught me off-guard.  

The food ended up being really good, although the preparation was pretty slow (and as I mentioned, we were in a bit of a hurry).  I really enjoyed the lobster and gnocchi dish - really unique and delicious.  Great blend of flavors (who thought that peas would go with gnocchi?).  The salad was ok - I had the goat cheese and beet since I'm a sucker for goat cheese.

The reason that I must rate them highly though is because my dad was happy.  My dad, the world's pickiest eater.  The man who will not eat anything with \"cream\" or \"cheese\" or \"onion\" or \"garlic\" or anything, ANYTHING that he deems as different (which automatically becomes \"weird\" with an \"Ewww, who would want that?!\").  He ate the Amish chicken (I think the name helped, because he does have a weird thing for the Amish).  Of course he plained-it-up, opting for no polenta or relish, never touching the asparagus, and getting a side of fries.  He was pleased!  He LIKED it and really liked the fries.

Success!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by Braddock's. Initially, I had low expectations because it was inside a hotel named \"The Renaissance\". In actuality, though, the hotel is very trendy with alluring decor. The restaurant itself is fairly nice as well; kind of like an upscale Cheesecake Factory.

Regarding everything else -- service was good and food wasn't bad either. I should state here that I did have a Groupon though. Would I have been satisfied with my dining experience if I had to pay full price? Probably not... but for $20 (including tax and tip), I'd say the bf and I left full and pretty satisfied before we headed out to the Steelers game (a mere 5-10 min. walk)."}
{"text":"I just recently got to experience Braddock's on a whim with a friend on a Friday evening. I was surprised they weren't busier at 6pm on a Friday, but it's possible that they get busier later, as 6pm can actually be considered early on a weekend. 

We ordered a glass of wine (a surprisingly affordable glass of Cabernet) and the cheese plate appetizer. It was amazing! The service was OK, although the server seemed like she was running the whole place (or something was keeping her busy and spacey) and the expediter seemed a bit distant, too. This was a little bit of a surprise for a place like this, but we were in a good mood and it genuinely didn't bother us.

I chose to order from the bar menu because after walking through and seeing someone with a burger, my mind immediately had made up its' mind. I got the Braddock's Burger and it was amazing! The beef bacon was almost too much, but I appreciated the uniqueness. The meat was cooked perfectly and was juicy and flavored well, without being too over-powerful and you could still taste burger. The bun never got soggy and help up. The fries were also good, but a little too salty.

My only real complaint is the location of the bathrooms. They are hotel / public bathrooms that are up a very large set of stairs. I'm fine with it, but I was surprised that they weren't more convenient. 

Overall, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Been going here for a number of years now and this last time was really disappointing. Reasonably priced for a downtown restaurant, but this last time the Steak and Frits we ordered was a really cheap cut of meat unlike  the steak they've offered the past years we've been here.
I'll try it again but if it's the same thing, then this place will be off my list of preferred places to dine while in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Visited the place several times. If you are going to the Byham Theater it is really convenient being next door and parking across the street.  The wait staff is friendly and efficient.  The food is three stars but Happy Hour and Wednesday Whiskey specials make up for any shortcomings.  We come here often and are never disappointed ."}
{"text":"Had high hopes for Braddock's as I had dined here once before and had a great experience.  Their bourbon list is great, and their dessert (a berry crisp with cinnamon ice cream) was delish.  Otherwise we were disappointed.  First disappointment was that I had reserved a booth only to find out when we got there and they brought us to a regular table that they did not reserve one for us.  The food was not great this time either - may have been rushed in the kitchen as it was a busier night.  The waiter talked me out of the ribeye steak that I had last time saying that the pork chop blows it out of the water.  I went for it thinking it would be similar to the amazing pork chop that Casbah serves.  It was ok - very tender (almost too tender), but did not like the flavor combination.  My father-in-law ordered the kielbasa platter and the kielbasa came out dry and the mustard had literally crusted over and hardened a bit to the plate.  When he asked for new mustard and showed the plate to the waiter, he didn't even offer to get a fresh one, but instead asked which mustard he would like brought as a side.  He needed all of them because obviously the plate was made up way too early and they were literally hardened onto the board.  Yuck!  The beet salad was good, but I'd call it a salad with a little beet added rather than a beet salad.  When it comes out you can't even see that there are beets there, they are just a thin layer at the bottom.  Would order this again because it was quite good, but not what you are expecting when you order beets.  My mother-in-law had the fish special and it was awful.  She didn't even eat it.  My husband ordered the salmon and it was ok, but smothered in a sauce that we did not like.  If we go back it will probably just be for drinks and dessert!  The atmosphere is amazing - love the looks of this place.  The wait staff is pretty good as well.  The entrees really are the disappointing part which is a shame because this restaurant has so much potential!  I'd recommend better/fresher ingredients so that everything doesn't have to be covered in a heavy sauce.  A few tweaks and I think this could be a great spot!"}
{"text":"MacN cini was amazing, but service was average or below. At the bar, and biased in that it's a pet peeve, but waiting to pay--especially while staff mills about--is infuriating."}
{"text":"I Went to Braddock's for dinner with my fiancee.

The synopsis: A reasonably executed yet uninspired meal.
Dinner began with drinks. The drink selection was varied but we both chose cocktails. My fiancee's \"Braddock Smash\" and my \"Moscow Mule\" were both well made, though my drink was not served in the correct vessel. 

We chose the charcuterie board (half) for our opener, the selection of meats included no spectacular choices. I was reminded of a cold cut platter from the supermarket.

Provided with the meal was a rather nondescript bread, with a well warmed butter sprinkled with sea salt. 

The meal took a pleasant turn as our entree arrived. A beautifully cooked (medium rare as requested) 18 ounce cowboy steak (ribeye). The steak was served on cooked yet still crisp asparagus spears and a bed of smooth mashed potatoes with what I can only guess was a veal demi glace. Truely the high point of the meal.

Coming off of the well executed main course we moved on the dessert. At the servers recommendation we chose the croissant bread pudding. The dish arrived and looked amazing. This look was only skin deep. The interior was quite dry - a matter we remedied with additional creme anglaise and caramel sauce procured for us by our waitress.

I enjoyed the meal well enough overall, though I doubt I would return."}
{"text":"Came here for New Years - horrible! I wish 0 was an option. Our table took 20 minutes to prepare past our reservation time, all of the tables inside had dirty glasses, very VERY slow paced, expensive and overpriced food."}
{"text":"From the second we got here we had a great experience. The hostess who greeted us was extremely friendly and our waiter (Luis) was just perfect - friendly, knowledgeable, and adorable. :) The two gentlemen who brought us our food and cleared our dishes were also a pleasure.

As is our custom at restaurants we've not been to before, we ordered a big sampling of menu items (we both worked out a lot to make room for all the calories we were planning on consuming. (; ) We split four appetizers: short rib pierogies (perfectly refined comfort food), house Mac and cini (cheesy and fried happiness,) NY strip tartare (delicate and clean), and the bacon wrapped shrimp and cheddar grits (deliciously indulgent). Out of the four, my husband was crazy about the shrimp and grits (which says a lot since we frequently make that at home, from scratch, for dinner). I think I preferred the tartare (pierogies were a close second!)

As an entree, I got the half portion gnocchi and lobster. I will totally be coming back for it. Usually lobster mixed in with pasta or gnocchi is a gimmick. Not this! The amount of lobster was substantial (and *real* lobster, not langoustine) and paired perfectly with the sauce and gnocchi.

My husband got the fish and chips (huge portion, very tasty. He said he'd get it again.) The meatball was okay. But, I say this as an Italian who makes meatballs from scratch and my husband is also Italian. So, we're picky. ;) By the way, most of our entrees got packed up to go home. Our stomachs aren't THAT big. :)

For drinks, I got the Pittsburgh Winery white blend which was not too sweet, not too dry. It was a perfect white for my palate. My husband got Straub IPL (on tap) which he really enjoyed. 

For dessert, we made some modifications. :) I got their creme brÃ»lÃ©e of the day with a side of cinnamon ice cream. My husband got the brownie with a side of their spicy chocolate sauce. 

I was leery about coming here because of the 3.5 Yelp rating. I'm glad I ignored that low rating because this place was fantastic. The food and service combined earned this place five stars. We will be in the city next week and are actually thinking about coming here again. Side note: the manager (Kristin) was awesome!"}
{"text":"Very unimpressive Mothers Day brunch. Layout was terrible, service was inattentive and unprepared (perhaps the guaranteed 20% gratuity built in to our check), and food was constantly out on buffet. Seemed like they were generally not ready to execute--certainly for the inflated pricing they were getting. Beautiful space but other than that a forgettable meal."}
{"text":"Brunch was great and the service was even better!! The bar in the hotel is very good and has a good vibe, steady to busy often... the food was above average, live breakfast stations as well as all the standard hotel buffet brunch items. All done well with a touch of class and care the wife and I have come to expect when traveling."}
{"text":"Underwhelmed. The server did go out of his way to make up for what started out badly but the food was \"meh\"."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious. We came here before a show, my husband had the strip steak and I had the duck. Both were very well prepared. We also tried the meat try which was also delicious. Definitely would come back again and recommend it to others. The cost with the portions you get are well worth it."}
{"text":"This is review is written as a note of caution that some drinks do not list the price, which may exceed an amount you were prepared to spend.  The meals were good, service prompt - however we would have appreciated knowing that a drink was a bit higher than usual, for one, on a night that was meant to be a quick, later evening bite.  Yes, I should have asked but it truly never occurred to me, looking at other marked prices, to ask.  Otherwise, a nice restaurant."}
{"text":"Very good, lots to like.

Other reviewers have covered the setting well, but let me add that it's just fun to be inside this place.  Okay, on to the food.  The Kielbasa Board is not to be missed.  It's locally sourced meats, some pickled vegetables, and some amazing, house-made mustards.  The big, brandied pork chop is flavorful, and the cheese-grits served with it are a nice touch.

Our server was great.  He was enthusiastic and very knowledgeable.  When I asked what he liked, he had good answers and made good suggestions.  He was attentive, kept our drinks full, and showed up at appropriate times to haul off spent dishes and plates.

I did not get a chance to sample any whiskeys this time, so I have nothing to offer beyond the fact that their list is VAST.  I'll have to do some sipping next time, and I do plan to come back."}
{"text":"We stopped at Braddock's Pittsburgh Brasserie on a Friday night before heading over to the Byham Theater for the annual DVE Morning Show Comedy festival.  We had already eaten elsewhere so this visit was simply for wetting our whistles before heading to the show.

We bellied up to the bar.  The bar area was moderately busy but not overwhelming.  From what I gather there is a dining room located across the way.  There was only one bartender and we patiently waited to be served.  The bartender was pouring some drinks for the patrons already seated.  I glanced over the drafts and picked an IPA to go with and waited, and waited some more.  In the meantime a party of about 6 rolled over to the corner of the bar where we were seated and were standing there.  We had probably been waiting about 10 minutes by now.  Finally the bartender comes towards us just to pass right by to the crowd standing at the corner!  Blood boiled; foot tapped hard, face red.  So you know I am not happy.  I am actually trying to tell this bartender that we had been waiting long before these folks walked over but he ignored me.  Thank God there was a server that just so happened to be behind the bar when this occurred.  I said, I guess kind of rudely, do you think you could get us a drink?!  He looked at the bartender and kind of shook his head saying he was a server and was trying to get the drinks for his tables but sure.  I said I was sorry but we had been waiting and was completely ignored.  He seemed sympathetic, almost like he was solemnly agreeing out of experience.  

We finished the first round and thankfully the same server happened to be behind the bar again.  I asked for two more and our check.  I thanked him profusely and stated I believed they have the wrong person running the bar.  He saved this review from one star.  Great job, wish I knew his name.  Maybe some time I will try them again, but I would steer clear of the bar if that same bartender were working."}
{"text":"Braddock's is a small bar located inside the front entrance of the Renaissance Hotel. Usually I avoid \"hotel bars\" but this one should be set apart from that label. They have excellent beers on tap including some local brews in addition to Victory and....wait...is that Merry Monks on tap!? Oh boy. Looking over both the bar menu and the Braddock's restaurant menu, I decided to keep it simple and get their burger with bacon. Very good. 

When the bartender, who as first seemed a little grumpy, asked me if I wanted another round, I told him I wanted a Victory. For some reason, he accidentally poured another Merry Monks, realized his error and was going to dump it. I almost had a heart attack and quickly told him to stop, refusing to witness such a tragedy. So, he ended up giving it to me for free. Thank you very much, sir!"}
{"text":"My wife and I just got into town following a five-hour drive and were looking for a place to have dinner after checking into our hotel. We found this place on Open Table and figured we'd give it a try. It is off the lobby of the the Renaissance Hotel, and at 6:00 on a Tuesday the place was nearly deserted, so we were a little concerned. But in the end it was a great choice. We had a white wine by the glass, and the barrel aged Manhattan with house-smoked vermouth and whiskey-soaked cherries. For an appetizer we had the the kielbasa board -- which included an outstanding and surprising sweet relish made with fresh blueberries, blackberries, and diced beets. For the entree, we both had the evening's special, which was halibut on a bed of arugula, grilled heirloom tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, fingerling potatoes and a dressing that defied description; it was all very inspired and creative. For dessert, we had the berry cobbler and the brownie, the latter of which came layered with charred marshmallow creme, vanilla ice cream, walnuts and bananas with a burnt-sugar crust. Everything -- the food, the service, the ambiance -- was outstanding. At the end of our meal our server went and got a local map, and took the time to give us some hints about places to see and how best to get around town. As we were leaving, there was live music in the hotel lobby, so we stopped to sit and listen for a while. All in all it was a wonderful night to have after a long drive."}
{"text":"Had a great Christmas Eve family dinner at Braddocks. The appetizers were  to die for including Braised pork Pierogies (this was my favorite), Kielbasa (large charcuterie style ) and stuffed sausage. All were some of the best apps I've ever had to be honest. I had a pretty good filet mignon as we'll but next time I will try something less generic. Great service and atmosphere in the renaissance hotel."}
{"text":"I will start out by saying that my friend is a chef there, so I am a bit biased, but the food really does stand on its own. 

J and I arrived at 7 pm on a Friday and it really wasn't as busy as I was expecting it to be.  We were sat in a very comfortable booth in the back where I ordered the blackberry capirinha (or some such spelling).  It's Brazilian, normally doesn't have blackberries in it, but is much better for it.  Even if you don't want food, this is the place to go for drinks.  The bartenders definitely know how to pour.  (We have been to the bar in the past for some of the best bourbon drinks I have ever had.)

The waitress brought us some fresh-made, warm bread with butter and sea salt.  I am not sure the salt is necessary.  Some salt and herbs would be nice though.  But the bread was very good.  We also got the braised short rib pierogies that are served on a bed of creamed leeks that tasted a lot like saurkraut, but milder.  They were perfectly cooked and really tasty.

For the main course, I had the mussels and frites in the Strip District sauce which was a tomato-garlic sauce with kielbasa and herbs.  I get mussels a lot and while the mussels weren't the best I have ever had, the sauce certainly was.  So much flavor packed into this tomato broth.  There was really not enough bread for me to sop it all up. The frites were also awesome - crunchy and covered in sea salt and herbs.  I think the salt was a bit heavy-handed, but it complimented the mussels very well.

J had the pasta special - fresh-made pasta in a tomato broth with scallops, shrimp, zucchini and a hint of lemon.  The scallops were smaller than we were expecting, but the flavor more than made up for it.  The shrimp were huge and the whole dish was very filling, and yet still light and summery.

Unfortunately, we did not have enough room for dessert (I think I ate a whole loaf of the bread myself), but we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Thanks to Restaurant.com a friend and I were able to check out Braddocks for very little money (thanks to an online deal I was able to get a $25 gift card for $2!) We ate at Braddocks Street Side which is their small bar located just off of the lobby in the Rennesiance Hotel. We went for lunch around 1 o'clock so we had the whole place to ourselves with the exception of 2 other patrons. The bar can hold about 25-35 people so it may not be the ideal place for group happy hour. 

My friend and I each ordered the french onion soup and burger. The soup was a very generous portion, as it should be for $7. It was very tasty and extremely rich. Neither of us were able to finish it. The burgers were good, buth nothing too special. I'm going to have to keep my eye out for another deal on the Restuarant.com coupons because there are about 10 other things on the menu I would love to try."}
{"text":"Braddock is your typical hotel restaurant in a nice downtown hotel.  Very nicely decorated with good service but the food is a bit overpriced for what you pay.  We ate here several times while staying at the Renaissance over the weekend since it's conveniently located inside the hotel.

The breakfast buffet here is $15/person and does not quite worth its value.  It's basically $15 for a continental breakfast with some hot items (eggs, bacon).  Lunch/dinner here is similar to your average American restaurant with burgers and sandwiches.  The service though is great and our waitress was very attentive to our needs.  For a hotel restaurant in a city downtown, expect the typical American grill.  Within walking distances are many more options so try something different unless you're looking for the convenience of a hotel restaurant."}
{"text":"Went to this place for lunch. The staffs are very nice. The food is good. I ordered mussel and my wife ordered crab cake. The mussels are very delicious and the crab cake is good."}
{"text":"The dinner I had of poor man lasagna with meatballs was so amazing and comforting!  It was so quiet there but the food was amazing."}
{"text":"I had the best meal here last night.  I needed a place near Heinz Hall because I was going to a show there after dinner.  This turned out to be an excellent choice.  I had a salad with beets and goat cheese.  I also wanted an appetizer size crab cake.  Our server suggested getting it on top of the salad.  Perfect!  I was in heaven.  The crab cake melted in my mouth.  The goat cheese was different than I thought it would be.  There were two little goat cheese \"cakes\" for lack of a better name.  They were dusted in something and sauteed, so the goat cheese was ever so warm.  Delicious.  All in all a satisfying pre-show dinner. Not too heavy, and very satisfying.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Went here for Mother's Day brunch yesterday and *deeply* regret it. Definitely did NOT get my money's worth. Waiter was mediocre and most of the food was seriously lacking in flavor. Wish I could go back in time and go to Grand Concourse instead."}
{"text":"We dined here for the first time on a Saturday night with tickets to a performance at the the theater next store.  Reservations for 6:15.  We arrived about 5 minutes late.  Waited 10 minutes for water and 25 for someone to get our drink order.  Poor service the entire night.  Many staff walked by our table without clearing plates/glasses etc.  Crab cakes were underwhelming and my husband's steak was tough and chewy.  Drinks were just ok.  Not impressed and won't be returning."}
{"text":"I went with a group of friends, and we were all impressed with the decor. The hotel is beautiful, and it's right by the baseball stadium, which is really cool. The drinks menu was awesome, and the drink I had was great.
I liked the butcher paper on the tables, and the waiter was really nice. He was great about answering my questions, and even helped me decide between two dishes that sounded good. 
I ultimately went with the lobster gnocchi, and the full serving was actually a huge plate of food. The gnocchi was nice (not the lightest gnocchi I have ever had, but pretty good), and the lobster was cooked well. The sauce was quite rich and decadent, and after a few bites, it was feeling like it needed some acid or lightness. I think a small side salad with a tangy vinaigrette would have been nice to add to the dish. 
I did take a go-box home, so I ended up getting 1.5 meals out of this, actually.

One of the other diners had the pork and beans, and it looked and smelled amazing. I would go for that the next time I go.

A tip about parking: if you ask the waiter, they will validate your valet parking if you eat at the restaurant. I really appreciated that, because it's a difficult area to park in, especially if there is a game going on."}
{"text":"This could have been 4 stars but the food was a little bit lacking.  First the good.  Very friendly staff behind the bar, with a great selection of hootch.  I had a Braddock Smash which was nice but not something I'd sit around drinking too much.  Now, the Whiskey Sours were well poured and very good.  And the wife's Vodka Tonics were very good, according to her.  And the homemade tater chips were excellent, and very addictive (and us on diets!! Geez).

However, the food could have been better.  We ordered off the Brassierre's menu, scallops for me, filet for her.  The scallops were ok but I've had better.  The polenta was a bit cool so not much to say about that.  The wife's filet looked good, had good texture, and was cooked right.  But it didn't appear to be seasoned.  Plus, the bearnaise was awfully thick, or at least thicker than what we're used to.

Overall, a good place to drink.  And although the food we ordered was off the mark a bit, I definitely wouldn't mind going back and trying a burger off of their menu (if it wasn't downtown, that is!!).

Update -  went back for drinks and dinner with wife and her brother.  This time I had something called the Pittsburgh Ugly sandwich, basically a Reuben with a sliced sausage link on it, topped off by a potato perogie.  What are these perogies y'all eat here?  This one was like trying to eat the cotton ball from a bottle of aspirin.  Yuck!!!  And the sandwich was so dry I could hardly chew it. Did they forget the Russian Dressing?  I'm taking no stars away from my original review but only because I like the bar.  Will not eat anything else here but the homemade tater chips."}
{"text":"Didn't blow me away, we had the pierogi of the month which was a fried chicken pierogi with siracha as well as the short rib pierogi for an appetizer and they were ok, not a ton of flavor. Unfortunately that was the theme of the night here- I got the hangar steak and it was nice and tender but really lacked flavor. Good but not great."}
{"text":"Braddock smash at happy hour five stars. Nice crowd.  Stayed after to eat. Had fish and chips and Pitt sandwich. Great values. Good service from bartenders."}
{"text":"I'm really surprised this place has 3 1/2 stars. I ate here last night, because I'm staying at the hotel, and the food was extremely mediocre. I ordered the crab cake appetizer (flavorless) and did not finish it. I also ordered the steak frites. I thought that was a safe option because it's pretty hard to screw up. The fries were good but the steak was smothered in this brown sauce that was not good at all. I tried scraping off as much as I could before consuming a small portion.  I ate at the bar, and the 1 redeeming factor was that the bartenders were super friendly."}
{"text":"Bacon caramel.  Yes, bacon caramel! 

 Some would argue that's all I need to say for this review, but I shall, dear reader, continue.  My husband and I came here because we had a groupon, and honestly, I wasn't expecting much from a hotel restaurant.  Boy, was I wrong.  The lobby of the hotel is really cool-- urban and chic-- and the restaurant decor continues in this vein.  The charcuterie plate was the stand out of the evening.  The \"small\" portion is loaded with cured meats, pates, little pickles and the fabulous bacon caramel.  The caramel was deep brown and sweet, loaded with chunks of thick-cut bacon.  We so enjoyed this first visit that we returned for my hubby's birthday.  All told, we've had the cheese platter (diverse, tasty cheeses), the lobster cassoulet (chock full o' lobster and delicious), seared scallops (cooked perfectly), veal milanese, and the steak frites (delicious fries).

If I love Braddock's so much why don't I marry it and give it 5 stars?  Well, the waitresses could be a little more put together.  Their uniform is a bulky black shirt with black pants, and a tailored look would go better with the atmosphere.  Also, their beers and cocktails, while delicious, can be a bit expensive.  Minor gripes, but they're keeping me at a 4.5 star review."}
{"text":"My parents have taken us here twice that we've been in town over the past few years and unfortunately the food has gone downhill.The bone marrow was good but I didn't enjoy the French onion soup with bourbon- WAY too much bourbon that nothing else came through. The beet and goat cheese salad was good but the mussels were way too fishy to be anywhere near fresh and I did not and would not eat them.  I would definitely recommend other restaurants in the area based on similar pricing and for superior food."}
{"text":"Largest selection of Bourbon in Pittsburgh...don't mind if I do.  Sat down and saw a selection of 7 Bourbons on the shelf and was pissed.  \"That's it?\"  Then I looked up and saw another 30.  

Haven't made it through all of them but the ones I had were amazing.  Plus the bar snacks \"potato chips\" are always incredible."}
{"text":"Well we enjoyed some things like the soup 

The fried Mac balls were cold inside and sent back 
It wasn't taken off our bill until we mentioned it

Desserts are low quality and huge 
Bread pudding was the worst ever but I'm well traveled and know what it should be like . Theirs was huge with dry exposed pieces of bread not soaked at all in liquor or sauces 
Their whipped cream tasted like cool whip but local people of course may be fine with this 

Huge dessert portions///That in itself is a sign of a poor bakery item but they appeal to a yinzer crowd I suppose 

The burgers are tasteless and bland and overpriced  , fries soggy 

Drinks needed work 

The servers don't have manners at all 

They ask you how your meal is WHILE they carry food to the kitchen as it to kill 2 birds with one stone 

I think their staff comes from the north side 
They are loud and not well spoken 

The table bread was not good."}
{"text":"Nice little setup. Was pretty chilly from cold air blowing in front door. They were out of the wine I wanted (local Pittsburgh white blend), so that was a bummer. Tried the pork belly appetizer. It was good and interesting flavors. The cheese grits that came with it were out of this world. I could eat those as a meal. Got the potato gnocchi lobster pasta for my main dish. It was not very pretty, but actually tasted really good. Super rich though, so I was glad I got the half portion. For a side of the sweet corn risotto and I found it bland. My friend for the goat cheese and beet salad and liked it ok."}
{"text":"Color me unimpressed on almost every level.

Came here for Saturday brunch with reasonably high hopes because we were staying in the attached Renaissance hotel. The menu sounded good and with limited promising brunch options in downtown Pittsburgh, I was happy to give it a shot.

The trouble began almost immediately, when we had to wait almost 10 minutes for a table despite the restaurant being not that busy. It was just...bizarre.

When we finally did sit down we ordered two orange juices, which tasted quite clearly like the bottled stuff you can buy at any airport, and ordered our food.

It took about 35 minutes for them to cook up a stack of lemon ricotta pancakes, two scrambled eggs and an omelette. Again, the restaurant was not busy. It took another 10 minutes and two separate requests of two different waiters to procure a bottle of hot sauce. And this was perhaps Braddocks' foremost issue: every member of their small army of employees seemed more interested in marching around the restaurant with important-looking faces and empty hands than of actually doing, you know, things.

All would have been forgiven had the food been wonderful, but it was just plain meh. My eggs looked and tasted like they had taken a nap before coming to the table. Pancakes were dry. Omelette was nothing special. I could have easily cooked up tastier food in my own kitchen. The food alone was probably 2.5 stars. Combined with the service, the total experience was more like 1.5"}
{"text":"I've only gone here for breakfast and brunch.  Like most breakfast buffets, this one is overpriced.  However, even the entrees are not that good of a deal.  The killer for this one is that there are many alternatives within walking distance.  The only reason for repeat visits was that they were comp'd by the hotel.

That said, the hotel is beautiful so the ambiance is solid, and the service was top notch.  2.5 stars."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that as a recent graduate who's moving halfway around the world in a couple of months, if not for Groupon, I wouldn't have ended up here.  It's costly.  That said, I'm glad I got the chance to try it out.

Braddock's American Brasserie is sort of half-attached to a hotel downtown.  It's not a big place, mostly just a bar and a series of tables.  The noise level is about right: You can have a conversation without feeling like everyone's going to hear you, but there's no trouble hearing the people at your table.  The ambiance is slightly classy, but in jeans and a t-shirt I still didn't feel like I was under-dressed.  

We went for the burgers, and I was not disappointed.  I ordered the Pittsburgher, which is topped with barbecue sauce (if I recall correctly,) a short-rib pierogie, and caramelized onions.  It was delicious and monstrously heavy, which is exactly what I was hoping for.  Sure, it was a bit messy, but totally worth it.  Word of advice: Unless you're counting calories, get the fries, not the salad.  The salad my buddy got was tiny, but they REALLY pile on the fries.

For a place that makes a big deal of their whiskey selection, I'd have to say my Manhattan was mixed well, and they certainly didn't skimp on the liquor.  That's good, because it was $9, so if anything had been wrong with it, it would have cost WAY too much.

My friend got a plate full of scallops, and they were perfectly done.  I generally don't like shellfish, so if I ate them and liked them, I'd recommend them as an appetizer to anyone.

In the complaint department, I would say our waitress had to come back and ask us to remind her what we had ordered a couple of times, which wasn't really a problem, just sort of unusual.  Also, my friend's burger was only okay, according to him.  They promised him hot sauce, and they didn't really put much on it.

If you're downtown, and looking for a decent burger, try this place."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat and drink downtown. Great craft cocktails and whiskeys to choose from. Service is always first class... Especially in the bar. Mike and Matt really know their stuff and are super cool guys to chat with. The food is out standing and they are very accommodating with peoples wants and diet choices. Kudos to Brandon and Tony also... They're working very hard to put this spot on the map!"}
{"text":"Tucked in the back of an upscale hotel, Braddock's is a lovely treat. 

I was very surprised to see that the restaurant was virtually empty, but then again there was a Pirates game that the entire city seemed to be at. 

We were seated immediately. We decided on dinner here based on the restaurant.com coupon, what a deal it was! 

To start we ordered the wild mushroom rice balls, braised short rib pierogies, and an order of the gnocchi with creamed leeks, Gorgonzola, and lobster. The gnocchi was the best I have ever tasted. The lobster was tender and there was a ton of it, and the sauce was addicting. It was the perfect dish. I could have lived without the short rib pierogies, they weren't great, and the short ribs seemed to be overcooked. The rice balls were pretty good!

Next, was soup. We got the French onion and tomato bisque. French onion was amazing, the tomato soup on the other hand was awful. We didn't touch it. Our waiter was kind enough to even take it off our bill.

For my entree I ordered the sea scallops with sweet corn. It different from the menu I saw online but I was able to change it to my preferences. The entree portion had a whopping 8 scallops on one plate. I was in shock. That is a massive portion, especially at $28. The scallops were cooked perfectly and everything that accompanied it was delicious. My family seemed to enjoy their meals as well, but I was too busy enjoying my scallops to really be sure.

Cocktails were strong, service (even though my brother-in-law scared the waiter) was great, and the food was good. I'd visit again when in Pitt."}
{"text":"Fantastic lunch! I had the braised beef perogies, tomato bisque, and croque Marin. Everything thing was outstanding. My server Tahir was great and I was not able to tell him what I liked best because everything was great!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here the evening of Christmas. I had made a reservation as we were just stopping in the city for the evening on our holiday road trip. I am going to go ahead and assume they were short staffed that evening because of the holiday. My husband had their candied pork chop and he devoured it. Said it was the best pork chop he has had.  I had steak.  It was very good, but over cooked.  I had requested medium rare and it was more medium/medium well. But it was still tasty. And they probably would have fixed it had I said something, but I didn't say anything (assuming they are understaffed for the holiday).  They had a good wine selection.  The selections were a bit pricey, but good. Overall we had a really nice and enjoyable meal!  Service was good as well!"}
{"text":"My wife and I tried Braddock's for the first time last Friday before a show in downtown Pittsbugh,  and we were very nicely surprised!  Beautiful setting in the Rennisance Hotel, with very nice ambiance and pleasant atmosphere. The Irish beef peroigie appetizer was delicious, and the salads were very good. Our main entrees were excellent, and the desserts were to die for! Our server Michelle was wonderful and very attentive to our needs. I highly recommend Braddock's American Brasserie!"}
{"text":"The hotel lobby is beautiful and the restaurant is elegant and relaxing that is until our server showed up.  She was a klutz and a generally unprofessional.  We ordered champagne and she overfilled one glass and tried to make a joke about it but didn't clean it up.  When she refilled our glasses she commented that she should probably walk around instead of reaching across but instead she reached across the table and dripped water from the outside of the bottle all over the table, on our bread and butter.  I commented that maybe she should wrap the bottle in a napkin and she said \"Oh yea I should\".  The food was very good, soup, salad and entrÃ©e were all good and nicely presented.  The server needs a lot of training!  The next morning we did not eat there but as we left I noticed that the hostess was dressed in dark jeans and a plaid shirt, very unprofessional for a hotel of this caliber."}
{"text":"Valentines weekend with my Honey! It was a Saturday night after the big love holiday. I had a Living Social deal for dinner. Made a reservation at 8pm 2 weeks in advance and I was set. Parking in the garage on a Saturday night on 6th street pre event, symphony, theater, what have you.... slightly painful but not really an issue. The restaurant is inside a hotel. Did not know that. The decor is modern romantic, deep booths, dark browns, and violets. The booths take you back to an older era. Mob boss round booths have an intimate appeal. I had asked from my open table reservation to be placed out of the way but we were sat in the middle of the restaurant in an angled booth. It felt like I was on a center stage. 

The menu was interesting but one item caught my eye. Lobster Cassoulet! They were sold out. Pouting I asked the waitress to reccomend something for me. Lobster Gnocchi?? Hmmm. Gnocchi can be kind of heavy and pasty but I went with it.

So incredibly delicious. Tiny puffs in a creamy mushroom and artichoke base sauce. Lots a lobster and perfect sweet claw meat right on top of the dish. If I would go back for just one item it would be The lobster gnocchi. \" Lobster Killer\" They have two sizes half and full portion. I was begrudgingly sharing with my BF so we got the full but I don't think the half would have been adequate.

To start we had the meat plate. The sauces were tasty that accompanied the various meats in the Charcuterie plate. The half size is plenty for two. The BF had mussels that were good and standard. If we did not have a deal the bill would have been on the expensive side and we didn't order anything alcoholic either."}
{"text":"The service is not great at the bar--involving me waving down bartendrons--but the drinks are fair.   The potato chips are SALTY.  Like, \"knock the salt off before you put it in your mouth\" salty."}
{"text":"I ate here three different times. I came here with a g/roupon, but the average dish is priced at about $13. I had the fish and chips ($13), the Braddocks ($11) burger and the cheese burger ($9). I also tried the Brushchetta ($7), and the fried zucchini. Overall my pick was the Braddocks burger as it contained beef bacon (like a juicy beef jerky), and a relish salsa. I was not a fan of the fish and chips at all. The Brushchetta was the best item I ate there is is probably the best Brushchetta I have ever had. I considered bumping the place up a star because of this, but since its just an appetizer, it gets less weight. Let me put it this way - I wouldn't eat here without the discount. 

You get a good amount of food, but you pay for it. Service was pretty good each time. 

Food Quality/Taste = 3 Stars
Portion Size Given Price = 4 Stars

{"text":"Beautiful!

Had breakfast here at the Sunday brunch, and it was pretty good.

If we had not had a free pass from the hotel, I don't know if we would have gone here because it is pretty $$$.

The buffett was big, and they did have a lot of different stuff.

I would say that the lighting is pretty dramatic for a morning, like I wish I could maybe see some daylight from a window instead of dramatic lighting."}
{"text":"One of the best brunch places I've been in a long time! For $20 it's all you can eat. Everything you could want to chow down on in the morning, even a personalized omelette bar and perogies! I ate here with friends and family after we finished the Pittsburgh marathon. It was the perfect way to refuel. Good service, too. One thing to note - it is in the lobby of the hotel, so go ahead and enter through its front doors."}
{"text":"Wow!!! The food at Braddock's is amazing ~ and the ambience is warm, welcoming, and fun. Comfort food at its best. The short-rib pierogis are incredible and so is everything else. Kind and friendly service and truly, a great taste of Pittsburgh hospitality! Thank you Braddock's!"}
{"text":"Love the food here! Came here at christmas, it is the only place open nearby, try it love it! Especially the brownies!!"}
{"text":"Located on the first floor of the beautiful Renaissance Hotel, Braddock's Pittsburgh Brasserie is a first class breakfast/brunch buffet that includes a capable chef making made to order omelets AND egg's Benedict!  I've never had the option to personalize my egg's Benedict (choose between Canadian bacon, kielbasa, or  hmm...forgot the third choice) and I wasn't disappointed.  

In addition to the egg entrees there is an excellent selection of fresh and delicious fruit, crisp bacon, sausage, biscuits and gravy, and some tasty and fresh pastries.  All this, with a coffee, comes to about $23.  I guess my only constructive criticism is that for that price I think a Bloody Mary or mimosa should be included.

Fantastic service as well!  My coffee cup was always full and extra plates never sat on the table for long."}
{"text":"This restaurant features a nice dining experience and delicious food.  The mood in the restaurant is dark, kinda of romantic, but great for parties.  The menu has a nice variety of American cuisine, delicious and prepared and presented well.  highly recommended for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Jarod at the bar made THE ABSOLUTE BEST cocktail I've ever had.  It is a take on a Moscow mule with muddled berries, and rum instead of vodka.  He usually makes it with whiskey, but I asked for rum.  Freaking awesome!!!!!"}
{"text":"I am really torn about this review.  Our server was fantastic and we really enjoyed the food and drink, but two of our group members ended up with food poisoning (we think that it was the mussels) after our meal.  We opted to do a mix of plates including their jumbo lump crab cake, braised short ribs pierogies, arancinis. potato gnocchi & lobster, and the mussels.  Overall, during the meal - I enjoyed all of the food with my favorite being the lobster gnocchi and the arancinis were a bit bitter from the port wine.  

We also tried a smattering of their drinks from the Braddock's smash to the moscow mule and prohibition pear martini.  They also have a make your own manhattan option.  For a hotel restaurant, this was a really great option inside of The Renaissance which is eclectically upscale.  If it wasn't for the food poisoning, this review would be four stars."}
{"text":"Another place in Pittsburgh that I thought I had previously reviewed but somehow missed!

Braddock's Street Side Grill/Bar resides inside the Renaissance Pittsburgh Hotel - a Marriott property. There is an entrance from both the street and from inside the hotel.

It's a small bar, but it's a good place to hang out, drink, and grab a bite to eat, assuming you want to eat earlier. They don't serve food here past 10:00 pm or so - which is kind of lame. Because of the nature of the downtown area in which the hotel is located, there are not a lot of residents - so most of the restaurants seem to close early. It's a damn shame too - as this place is missing out on offering more service to both hotel patrons and others in the area.

I stayed at this hotel 3 years ago for 3 days. During that stay, a majorly scary bout of severe weather pounded a large area of the upper midwest, including the Pittsburgh area - with unprecedented thunderstorm activity, flooding, and Tornadoes. Many of the hotel guests gathered in the Bar to drink and watch the Weather Channel and local weather station reports coming in - there were myriad Tornado watches and warnings - some not very far from Pittsburgh.

I pounded a few beers and single malt scotches during that scary period, and ate in the bar every night.

This last stay this past week - we came in to order food - and were informed that since it was after 10:00 pm - no food was available. I'll say it again - LAME! EPIC FAIL!

I like this little bar - but it's hard for me to give it more than 3 stars due to the food hours..."}
{"text":"Only eat at Braddock's if you aren't hungry and don't like too much to drink. Service couldn't be slower. Sat for a half hour until they finally took our order. Food arrived a half hour or so later - we had been there over an hour. No offers for refills, so you'll be fine to drive home. Maybe they don't like selling their booze....but if you're looking for food and drink, find another spot."}
{"text":"First of all, the atmosphere of the Renaissance itself is fantastic. I came here on the Cultural District's Winter Gallery Crawl last night for appetizers. Our waitress was cheerful and our drinks were never empty (I down water like a fish, so finding waitstaff that can keep up is impressive). 

I ordered the cheese board and my boyfriend ordered the \"Strip District\" mussels and frites. The mixed berry compote served with the board was phenomenal when paired with one of the spicy cheeses. Apples, crostinis, and roasted nuts added great texture and the cheeses themselves were yummy. The mussels were served with kielbasa to achieve the \"Strip District\"-esque theme. I can't decide what was better: the frites or just the aoli that they were served with."}
{"text":"Braddock's is a small bar inside of the Renaissance hotel.  We were in town for only one night, to go to the Pirates game, and we were staying at the hotel.  After the game, we were pretty tired but up for a drink.

We headed here immediately after the game, and the bar wasn't too crowded.  Right around the time we finished our drinks, there was hardly any standing room left!

I was happy with my $6 gin & tonic, but there wasn't much about the bar keeping me tuned in and interested in staying for another drink.

During Happy Hour, all well drinks are only $4.  There's also a small food menu.

Worth a visit if you're staying in the hotel or passing by and craving a cocktail.  Braddock's isn't really a place to party or consider a destination."}
{"text":"Back in Pittsburgh. I arrived at the hotel late after working. I grabbed a table in Braddock's for a late meal and to watch Monday Night Football.

I had mussels & frites with a Braddock's smash cocktail. The food and drink were excellent. Braddock's has a great menu."}
{"text":"My mom was in town for a conference, and I thought it was the perfect opportunity to use my Groupon to Braddock's.  A short walk from her hotel on a beautiful day, we strolled in to the lobby of the Renaissance hotel to find the restaurant.  What a GORGEOUS hotel!  It makes me want to wear a long red dress and walk slowly down a staircase to greet a crowd of admirers.  Classy place.

The restaurant has a classy vibe too - leather booths, white tablecloths, and dim lights.  We started with cocktails - alas, the cocktail menu is not on the website (or I'm dumb and can't find it) - but whatever we had, it was delicious.  I believe it was marked as the house specialty cocktail.  I wasn't sure I'd like it because sometimes I'm a little iffy on whiskey, but it was actually fruity and delicious.  We both loved it.

Next, we split the goat cheese and beet salad (which they put on separate plates for us), and it was great.  Sweet beets, amazing fried goat cheese, tasty vinaigrette.  Oh - and we also got a soft, warm baguette wrapped in paper, with a plate of sweet butter.

For my entree, I had mussels and frites \"Billi-bi\" style, which means in a saffron-cream broth.  The frites were served with an aioli.  I also had a side of garlic spinach.  The entree didn't bowl me over - mussels were well prepared and the broth was tasty, but it wasn't long before it seemed too rich for me, and became a little hard to eat.  There was just so much broth and it was so creamy!  The spinach did a nice job of cutting through the heavy meal, but the overall effect was still a bit much. 

Way too full for dessert!  I think our meal came to about $90 (Mom got the daily special, a fish dish) - so that's $90 for two drinks, one salad, a side dish, and two entrees.  It's pricey.  The Groupon helped. I think I would return though, it made a good impression.  Our server felt a bit rushed - she didn't really connect with us and always seemed to be moving quickly, but that's okay.  There weren't many people in the restaurant at all, which was kind of sad on a Friday.  More people should give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"I didn't eat here. We came to have some whiskey and were not disappointed in the slightest. Huge selection of bourbon with a good amount of rye and scotch as well. The Braddock Smash is a fantastic cocktail. The lobby/lounge area that is shared with the hotel is really epic. Definitely one of the best spots in the city in terms of outrageous use of marble to tip folks off to the amount of wealth that used to be concentrated in the area. I'll definitely be back for a drink and hopefully dinner next time."}
{"text":"This place was hopping and we enjoyed grabbing a drink and appetizer.  There is a street-view bar, the lobby of the hotel and then the restaurant in the back.  We actually ordered at the bar and went and sat at the long table near the video fish tank to people watch and chat.  The server was Nicole and she was very nice and didn't mind serving us across the lobby.    We had been walking around the cultural district and just stopping in and soaking up the atmosphere of beautiful Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I recently went there for the first time. I was impressed with the dÃ©cor but also immediately put off my the service. I went for brunch on a Sunday, when I walked in there was not a host or server around to seat our party. Someone from the kitchen staff that was at the omelette station told us to just seat ourselves, so we did. 
It was not busy at all, there was only one other table there. We waited 10min before even being greeted by a server.

I went with the intentions of having breakfast which changed quickly after looking at the brunch buffet. The food had been sitting for a long time and you could tell (it looked very dried out). I still decided to get breakfast since there was an omelette station and Belgium waffle station that were both freshly made. 2 others in our party ordered the crab cake and steamed mussels and we're please with both.

I personally would not go back here for brunch or suggest the place to anyone else."}
{"text":"We had breakfast here during our last stay at the hotel.  The food was incredible and that's a term I use sparingly.  I would give it 5 stars but I don't believe one breakfast is enough evidence to warrant giving it my highest rating.  Completely recommend it as the best breakfast in the Cultural district."}
{"text":"We had a bad experience once at Braddocks and the response to our complaint was amazing. We are now frequent customers for a pre or post theater dinner and drink. 
A solid menu, not the most interesting but always good. 

I love that they will serve both menus in the restaurant or Streetside. I prefer Streetside just because I like the ambiance of a bar setting, but both are nice. 
Also, the sound level is great. They don't blast music and the acoustics allow you to hear the people you're dining with. 

My only complaint is that they over-cook their burgers, but that is more than compensated by the fact that their other food options are quite good. I highly recommend the short rib pierogies."}
{"text":"I have had three meals in the pub which shares the menu with the full service restaurant and I have been really really happy each time. What did I have? Why mussels in white wine of course w/ frites! Excellent. As a former resident of the Pacific Northwest I know a little something about shellfish. The mussels at Braddock's are by far the best I have had in Pittsburgh. Each time I ordered them a large steaming bowl was brought to the table. Each time every single mussel was delicious, plump and perfectly prepared. Not a single bad mussel...not one! The frites are crisp as one would expect with a Belgian preparation. They come with a garlic mayo dip. My friend had a Reuben made with portabello mushrooms rather than meat and it was excellent (I tried some:) My daughter had mac and cheese that was not your boxed version. The beer list is excellent with a great representation of local beers, nationals and import. I have yet to see the wine list, but expect that it has nice offerings. This has become my go to place when downtown for a chill beer and excellent shellfish."}
{"text":"The food was decent, but overpriced.  Although the restaurant was mostly empty, it took some time for us to be seated. The service was friendly and responsive.  There was nothing at all wrong with our experience, there are simply better alternatives available.

Not recommended."}
{"text":"I tried Braddock's tonight because of the Groupon. As others mentioned, the hotel is gorgeous and the restaurant has a really nice feel or ambiance.

They brought me complementary fresh baked bread with some unsalted butter with some sea salt on top. Very nice! Had the half portion of mussels as an appetizer which was well done except only a little broth at the bottom making it hard to dip. The broth was awesome for bread sopping.

I would award another star except my main dish of Lobster Cassoulet had overcooked lobster. Basically all claw meat which was chewy.

Service is good, and I think things are actually fairly priced (website menu is accurate). Parking was a little tricky, I ended up at the garage across the street."}
{"text":"The four stars are for service and drinks, as I've only eaten a couple of apps here and haven't been particularly wowed by them.  But Street Side is primarily a bar, and that it does very well.  They have what's probably the best whisk(e)y menu in Pittsburgh, with tasting flights available by style, label, and country, and they also serve our local Wigle.  The bartenders are incredibly friendly and prompt with service despite the length of the bar.  There's a nice lounge on the ground floor of the hotel where you can wait for a seat at the bar, and they serve drinks in there as well.  Much more casual than the Brasserie; you can get away with jeans here.

If you like whiskey, check out Street Side.  If you're looking for food, stick with the Brasserie or another restaurant in the area.  Discount certs are available on Restaurant.com if you're feeling cheap, and they ARE good on alcohol."}
{"text":"Braddock's is a nice downtown venue that serves very good food - I would certainly recommend it as an excellent pre-theater dining option.

I selected Braddock's because of its location - Heinz Hall is on the next block.  The restaurant is also near the Byham Theater and the Benedum Center.  There is a convenient city parking garage directly across 6th Street, where event parking was a very reasonable $7.  The restaurant itself is directly inside the very pleasant Renaissance Pittsburgh, complete with an old-fashioned lobby.

While the restaurant uses the term \"Brasserie,\" there didn't seem to be all that much French or Belgian about the establishment.  Most dishes are generally very good American-style options, mostly on the order of a steakhouse.  They did offer a french onion soup and bouillabaisse, as well as steak frites.  The steak options were cooked well and the filet mignon was very tender.  They did use a fair amount of bearnaise sauce, however, which made the dish feel a little heavy and somewhat dated.  The mashed potatoes were good, although not particularly inspired, while the asparagus was maybe a little limp.   The portions here are very generous here.  I ordered a caesar salad as a starter, and there as no way to finish the massive plates of green.  The dressing was excellent, however, and clearly made in house, with fresh notes of lemon.  There was certainly no possibility of dessert.  

The cocktails were very good, maybe the highlight. I had a well-made Martinez, while my table-mates enjoyed the whiskey smash.  The service was very, very good.  The server was friendly and responsive, and the food arrived quickly.  The manager even stopped by to ask whether we enjoyed our meal.  Before the salads and appetizers, the server came by with complimentary bread and butter.  The bread was a very good, if not superlative, baguette and the butter was served perfectly - at room temperature and generously salted.

Since this restaurant is in the lobby of the Renaissance, you should know that the bathrooms are on the second story.  There is an elevator in the lobby (as well as a lovely staircase) to provide access, but if you have limited mobility, you should note that the bathrooms are a bit far away from the dining area.  The bathrooms themselves were spacious and very clean - I suspect they are also used for function rooms on the second floor.

If you are downtown and near the theaters for dinner, Braddock's is a great option.  You will enjoy an excellent drink, good (if not all that adventurous) food, and a very nice, unpretentious atmosphere.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We had a pleasant time atmosphere was nice and the server was very attentive. Wasnt overly impressed with the food, but did enjoy the beet goat cheese salad and the French onion soup however. All and all I would go back but probably  just for apps."}
{"text":"Terrible awful worst in a long time . Drink more wine because you are going to need it"}
{"text":"My husband & I enjoyed an anniversary date here.  Service & atmosphere was great!  I recommend trying this establishment. I had the steak frites and my husband enjoyed the seafood pasta!  Go & enjoy!"}
{"text":"Good food. Good service. We had two appetizers. The brucetta was good. I really liked the goat cheese on it. And we had the crab cake. It was not fried, which was great because you could actually taste the crab meat.

 I had the risotto. It was a little heavy on the pepper in my opinion, but I'm not really big on pepper. 

My dad had the salmon. I had a bite and the whiskey glaze was very good. 

For dessert, we had the very cobbler. Sweet with a nice berry taste. Not very much crumble topping. 

Overall, it was a good meal. Worth a try if you're downtown looking for a nice place to eat."}
{"text":"My quest for super-delicious mussels in Pittsburgh led me to Braddock. There are 4 different sauces to choose from. They were really good....  but not 5 star.  I am still looking.  I have been to Point Breugge and Dish as well (specifically for mussels ), and I think Dish is in the lead so far."}
{"text":"Love this place. Been four times,  and wish i could go back more often. The French dip is to die for. The fries oh my, v good! Mixed salad was tangy and freshly prepared. Both the bar and restaurant are fab for a date."}
{"text":"This is a nice restaurant, classic looking.  High back seating and few tables spread throughout.  My son had the Pgh Big Ugly reuben and it was a bit much.  It was sloppy and difficult to bit.  It was an ok take on a great sandwich.  I hate to say Braddock's ruined it but they really went overboard with all the \"add-ins\" on this standard sandwich.  The salmon, well, it was salmon...take notes from Georgetowne Inn's chef because they have mastered this dish.  Braddock's is convenient if you do not want to try to endure Pgh's wintery weather and you are staying at the Renaissance."}
{"text":"I am rounding down from 3.5 here. This place is somewhat overrated--maybe a place to impress a date or perhaps an expense account dinner. But while I would eat here again, I would not choose to eat here again.

First, Braddock's is a bit pricey and some of the appetizer portions are much smaller than you would expect for the price. Second, there is a large selection of entrees and as a restaurant in a higher-end hotel there is the requisite elegance. Third, the salads and bread are great and they are food allergy friendly. Finally, the entrees are ok at best. Some of the dishes try too hard and are overly complicated which is not always a good thing.

Overall, however, I prefer Alihan's across the street for what I think is consistently better food at a much lower price (which also includes a free glass of wine)."}
{"text":"I stayed in the hotel and had both breakfast and lunch there on a Saturday.
Breakfast:  I had the french toast and it was unremarkable.  Two slices of battered bread.  Definitely a bonus point for having real maple syrup.  My partner had the egg white omelet.  It came with everything - toast, potatoes.  All very good.  I was hungry after the small french toast portion.
Lunch:  Mostly inedible.  The french onion soup was so salty it was bitter.  The caesar with a chick breast tasted mostly of artificial lemon with a dried out tasteless breast.  The hot bread and fresh butter was great. 
In both meals the atmosphere and the service were very nice.  The meals should be skipped."}
{"text":"Truthfully, we ate at this place because we stayed at the hotel and had a restaurant.com coupon.  We paid $4 for the $20 coupon - had to use it. 

This restaurant serves mediocre food at a high price.  Again, the coupon made us do it to ourselves.   Would not eat here if we were paying the full tab.   There are so many better options in the city.  Do yourself a favor...keep scrolling."}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss.  I have stayed at the Renaissance twice a week for the past 12 weeks and have consistently eaten here for breakfast.  Some days, I've had mold in my fruit, other days, my eggs have been runny and cold.  From burnt toast to cold coffee, there is always something wrong with my meal.  You are probably wondering why I've not switched to a different place.  Mostly because there are no other options.  I'm going to McDonald's tomorrow."}
{"text":"This is my boyfriend and mine's favorite place to go to when we want to treat ourselves nice.   Everything about the place is classy in my opinion.  The servers and waiters are very professional.  With that said, they have top notch gnocchi which I often times get cravings for.  I haven't had a single meal there I didn't like.  I like that they buy local, and their specials usually reflect that.  Their portions are huuuge, and the price is reasonable for the quality and amount of food you get.  Their desserts are also spectacular, but I must say I am disappointed they changed their apple tart (The first time we got it, it came with ice cream and baked basil on top - yum yum yum).  I would definitely and have recommended this restaurant to friends and family."}
{"text":"We took my mom here for her birthday and we loved it!  The service was great.  We ordered the bruschetta for our appetizer and it was perfect, and the seared scallops that I ordered for my main dish were just the right portion and were delicious!  I'm only sad that they stopped accepting restaurants.com gift cards."}
{"text":"My fiance and I are staying at the Renaissance.  We stopped at Braddock's the hotel bar. We cannot say enough good things about Michael. He was awesome! We were having a pretty bad night and he turned it around. He was just what we needed. Super friendly and hospitable.  I highly suggest dropping in for a drink or dessert. Both were superb!"}
{"text":"Went to lunch with my meet up group to celebrate St. Patrick's day parade here. The restaurant is located inside the grand Pittsburgh Renaissance hotel.

We started out with lamb shepherd's pie and bruschetta on crackers for appetizers. They both were so good that I really had to restrain myself from eating more since i wanted to save room for lunch.

They serve regular beverages in mason jars along with traditional drinks and wine. They offer a lunch pairing of either soup and salad or soup and sandwich for $12.00.
Our waitress was very friendly and attentive to our needs I opted for their French onion soup and spinach salad. She explained that my soup selection would be $1.50 up charge before I placed my order. She also explained these items would be half portions.

She also suggested I add one of the additional toppings. In my case I choose shrimp.The lady sitting next to me ordered a corned beef sandwich which the call \"the big ugly\" which comes with a side of fries.

When my meal arrived I was glad I ordered the combo. Their servings are huge!!! The French onion soup was to die for and the shrimp on my salad were full size and cooked just right.

The lady who ordered \"the big ugly\" got a portion so huge that you would need at least 2 or even 3 people to finish it. She absolutely loved it and as expected ended up taking most of it home.

The staff made sure our beverages were always full and cleared used plates upon asking first. For an elegant restaurant I was glad we were able to dress casual here.

They do offer Wi-Fi but for some reason if you wish to utilize it then you must give them your e-mail address. Restrooms are located on the 2nd floor where you can either use and elevator or walk their grand staircase which gives you a beautiful atrium view of the lobby area and entrance to the restaurant.

In the front entrance there is a bar called Braddock's Streetside. We didn't go there since we had so much to eat and drink here. I'm especially grateful when I am told upfront what my charges are as well as great food and professional service.

Located next to the Byhum Theater this restaurant makes a great place for either pre or after theater dining as well. Hats off for a wonderful luncheon!!!"}
{"text":"Service was great and very attentive. My wife got the Asian salad and I got the Pittsburgher sandwich...both delicious. Very upscale downtown restaurant"}
{"text":"My below-average rating is due to my most recent visit. I've been here a handful of times as the location is quite convenient to the theatre venues in town. Food is decent, but good food isn't hard to come by so it's really the service that makes the experience in my opinion. Our party of 7 has a reservation at noon before a 2p show last week. We were all on time and seated promptly and there were NOT many people there until probably 15-30 min after our arrival. Our waiter Gabe was never overly friendly and our drinks were empty (both waters and paid beverages) more than full. Many of us had to ask for refills. I ordered a burger done medium and when it was brought out, it was burned. Not well done -burned.  When I told the waiter, he looked at me disgusted and *literally* didn't say a word, just walked away with my plate. Who I assume was the manager came over probably 10 min later and gave a half apology, blamed being busy and having a new chef. She did comp my wine but I never expected that. Lunch took so long that we walked into our show at the Byham (...next door) just 10 min before the show started. Very underwhelmed at this point and uncertain on returning. I am however attaching a picture of my scallops from a previous dinner there that were delicious."}
{"text":"The skinny: great food, booze and service. 

I've stayed at the Renaissance twice in the last year and eaten at Braddock's twice. Both times, I was impressed. The first time was my pre-Yelp days, but I actually took a pic of the sandwich, because it was such a yummy monstrosity. It might have been a monte Cristo? 

This time, we ordered the pork belly and Mac n cini. Both were fantastic. The pork belly came with grits and chicharrones. The whole dish just worked well together. The other dish was essentially deep fried risotto balls (with just a hint of spice). Also excellent. I got the double chocolate mousse to go, and I was very happy in our hotel room when I dove into it about an hour later. 

A few other comments. Matt was our bartender/waiter. Very big props to Matt. I'm always a fan of people who are personable and knowledgeable. Matt is. I also like the newspaper style menu. Lastly, if you like bourbon or whiskey in general, they have a great selection."}
{"text":"Solid 5/7...only problem is if you're a full blown alcoholic it takes about 45 Minutes to get a drink ...other than that not a bad experience"}
{"text":"Went here for date night with my fiance. 

What we sampled: 
Braddock Smash (I had this and thought that it was well made and tasty)
Moscow Mule (My fiance was not impressed that it was not in a copper mug and was definitely not as good as the one you can get at Alchemy N Ale)
1/2 Charcuterie Board (meh.  It was pretty disappointing selection wise and overall was too cold and boring)
Cowboy Steak (Perfectly cooked and delicious the mashed potatoes were just ok but the asparagus were great.  When I tried to reheat this I found out that the demi glace was thickened with corn starch because everything started getting thick in the pan when heating up (did not work at all)). 
Croissant Bread Pudding (It was ok, but was definitely better when we asked for more creme anglaise and caramel sauce)

Overall it was a decent meal, but I don't think that I would return."}
{"text":"Braddock's should be admired for it's dedication to buying local.  Everything is described to you by friendly servers with where things come from.  Very impressive.  Especially for a hotel restaurant!  I think a lot of people have a common misconception that all hotel restaurants must be a chain of some sort.  It's nice that the Renaissance welcomes them in. 

The outer part of Braddock's is just a bar area or \"Braddock's Streetside.\"  The back part of Braddock's is a fancy dining room.  It's really quite gorgeous inside.  I couldn't pass up a tasty looking beet salad so I ordered one up.  It's a beautiful presentation with two unassuming fried goat cheese balls.  But holy crap were those some amazing balls!!  The beets were good, don't get me wrong... and I liked shallot vinaigrette, but those cheese balls... star of the show!  

I'd come back just for a plate full of those, even though I know it wouldn't be the healthiest option!  I definitely want to come back for dinner and get some of the other delicious sounding items and perhaps a cocktail.  It would be a nice date night spot.  Maybe even a romantical evening stay downtown at the hotel as well!  Fried cheese balls included in that package please!"}
{"text":"After laboring over the mouth watering menu for 20 minutes trying to narrow down our choices, my normally decisive wife and I gave up, and ordered all appetizers so we could try more things.  We went with the Braised Short Rib Pierogies, Roasted Beet and Fried Goat Cheese Salad with Seared Salmon, Home Made Meatballs stuffed with Provolone and Mozzarella, and Seasonal Wild Mushroom Risotto.  It was all delectable, freshly, and attractively prepared, and every bit as delicious as it sounds.  

Besides getting to try more things, the appetizers were a good deal.  The small plate apps and salads are mostly around $10, while the main courses are mostly $30-$35.  Everything was excellent and felt like we got a very fair value.  

I should caution any would be dieters that most of the dishes tended to be on the heavier side.  Granted we brought it on ourselves with the cheese stuffed meatballs and short rib pierogies, but in truth most of the menu wasn't stingy with batter, bacon, cheese, sausage, butter, cream, and Bearnaise sauce.  If you're trying to avoid a post meal coma, you may have a hard time finding anything sin free.  That said, if you are up for an indulgence (Because let's face it, you've earned it) you'll have a hard time treating yourself better than Braddocks!"}
{"text":"I stay at this hotel a lot when I travel to Pittsburgh for work. The restaurant has a great atmosphere. The food is excellent and the staff is very accommodating and very friendly. The manager walked around to the guest and asked how everything was. He was even helping the servers bring the food out. My steak was cooked PERFECT!! I ordered the filet mignon medium well and the chef cooked it perfect! It was very delicious. The dessert was amazing, croissant bread pudding. It's really a great place to eat and have a fun night out. I look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"J and I came here a 3 Friday's ago for a late dinner, around 10pm. The restaurant was closed, however the bar was still open and served the full menu. Steeler game was on, which is always nice. It was a pretty small space, approximately 7 tables and a moderate sized bar. It was also pretty loud, but that's to be expected. The menu was pretty cool as it showcases Pittsburgh's contribution to the Whiskey Rebellion and gave facts on the different types of whiskeys. I had a glass of white wine and j and I shared the cheese platter. For dinner, J had steak with asparagus and mashed potatoes and I had the jumbo lump crab cakes. Everything was pretty tasty. Our waiter was so welcoming and friendly, which made the overall experience great. It would have been nice to experience being in the restaurant, which closes at 10pm, but this was a nice alternative."}
{"text":"My friend and I started off in the bar. Our drinks were amazing. The bartender was great. He really paid attention to detail.
We had a great waitress named Autumn at the restaurant. I ate the crab cakes and asparagus. It was amazing. My friend had the steak and she said she was able to cut her filet with her butter knife it was so tender. The salads were good as well.
The only reason I give this four stars is because the restroom is out in the hotel, which is where their restaurant is located, and upstairs. Maybe this is a matter of them not having any space for a restroom in the restaurant, but it was annoying. Other than that, everything was perfect."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance.  Very good service.  Excellent menu variety.  Wonderful drink selection.

On another Yelper's recommendation I had the beet salad with fried goat cheese...magnificent!  I will go back JUST for that!  My 10 year old niece had a filet and veggies and cleaned her plate. The filet was delicious.  My mom had salmon and veggies...and it must have been wonderful because no one got a bite!  I also had the steak tartare...served with pork rinds!  LOVE!

A great place for a meal before the theatre...and what's not to love about the Renaissance!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here on 3 occasions. Once was for brunch ,which was rather good. Once again for dinner, I had the hen special, a little salty but not bad. Again at a venue called Picklesburgh. They sold a sandwich called \"Kielbasa Ban Mi\" which was suppose to be a rendition of  Vietnamese sandwich. It was nothing of the sort. It was just cooked Kielbasa on a bun, and you pick your \"pickling veggie\" of choice. Very bland. The restaurant is a little over priced, however that's hotel restaurants for you.  The hotel lobby and atmosphere is very nice. The food, just quasi."}
