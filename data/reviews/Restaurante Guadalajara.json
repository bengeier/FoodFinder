{"text":"DONT JUDGE THE BOOK BY ITS COVER!! This place looks ghetto on the outside and we almost just passed, but I am so glad we didn't!!! It is beautiful and very clean inside.  Staff was very nice and attended to us quickly. The food was delicious and authentic. We are going to be regulars here. I'm really glad we gave it a chance"}
{"text":"Went here for a quick bite after work was very impressed great food and cheap prices.  Very friendly staff the cook even came out to make sure we were happy with our food.  Not to mention I loved the chips mmmmm"}
{"text":"This place sells real authentic Mexican food and is really good. As soon as we walked in the setup was great. I would recommended you to take your family. The price is fair. We had a good time and will be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Amazing food! I visited the first week they were open and was blown away by the  authentic menu! Be sure to try Molcajetes!"}
{"text":"We started with a shrimp ceviche tostada and one with fish.  Not worth trying but I've had some awesome ceviches.  Spooned on some of their salsa and it really helped the ceviche.  Maybe their cocktail version is better.  I got a enchilada and chile rellano combo and was really surprised.  They have a great red enchilada sauce.  It is flavorful, thick, and really goes well with the rellano.  Can't give this place give stars because of the tostadas but I will be back want to try some of their other seafood dishes, and more of their food in general.  Service was great also."}
{"text":"Walked in and we were automatically greeted with a smile from Sam who sat us as well.  Very clean and well put together place. We had a party of six and our server and sam helped us with any questions we had. My boyfriend is a picky eater so he just got good ol' chicken enchiladas while the rest of is did a family style sharing which consisted of ceviche ( best in town ) Molcajete mariscos which was an amazing hot lava bowl of seafood and potatoes. The other two dishes that were ordered were Birria de chivo And carne en s√≠ jugo. Delish! Everything tasted homemade and real. The chef also greeted our table.  We ended the night with some bomb fried ice cream as well.  We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Total authentic Mexican dishes, a total must try if you are in the Nellis area. Restaurant is family owned and operated and the staff couldn't be more welcoming. Can't wait to go back and try more of their menu!"}
