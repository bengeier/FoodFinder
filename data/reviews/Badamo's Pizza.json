{"text":"recently just moved to the north side, i could see this place from our window. we ordered the 16\" pepperoni. amazing! the slices were huge & everything was fresh! my down fall is paying so much for a cup of ranch :( i feel like ranch should just come with your pizza. but other than that, it was great! i plan on trying the white pizza next. oh, & did i mention their menu is the absolute cutest!"}
{"text":"Order pizza from here... just stop what you're doing and order the pizza. I read other glowing reviews from fellow Yelpers and decided to order a pizza on National Pizza Day! We ordered a red pie with pepperoni and green peppers! After reading the other reviews, i decided to order a side of their homemade ranch. The food here did not disappoint! The pizza is traditional NY style pizza. As an added bonus, they have the little pepperoni that curls up when it's cooked! I'm so happy to have Badamos so close to my house!"}
{"text":"Moved to the North Side about 6 months ago and we were missing a great local pizza shop.  Badamo's completely fits that bill and I'm so happy they're here.  I've only had their thin crust, but it's just the right amount of crispy and chewy while being all sorts of delicious.  The toppings are great as well.  So happy they're in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"We ordered a pizza 30 minutes before arrival.  Once we arrived there was confusion between the girl who took the order and the people there picking up orders.  She mixed up two totally different names and gave our order to another customer.  We explained we had ordered 30 minutes prior.  She said our order will be ready in 2 minutes...20 minutes later our order is not ready.  There was no apology for the mix up. The customer service was very poor and inconsiderate. Had she apologized for the mix up there would have been no hard feelings. We ordered ahead of time so we would not have to wait as I was picking up after work.  After 20 minutes I decided to ask for a refund being she would not admit there was a mistake and we were on a time constraint.  Still no apology, and likely will not patronize again because of the worker taking the orders/answering the phones."}
{"text":"In my opinion, hands down the best tasting pizza available in Pittsburgh. Awesome staff too! (Hard to replicate NYC style pizza. ) Consider 4 stars 5, coming from a New Yorker..."}
{"text":"Wow. Just bought a pizza for staff, as it came highly recommended. We love their pizza over at Brugge on North. Probably one of the best Sicilian pizzas I've had, ever. Holy crap, yumm. Will highly recommend. Music section while waiting is awesome and staff was super friendly. Here, take my wallet."}
{"text":"Pizza is awesome!  We've had both the regular and white.  Toppings were plentiful.  Now it's Best pizza in Central Northside"}
{"text":"That Sicilian square cut was [finger kissing gesture]!  They're right in the neighborhood, so the lack of delivery that other folks mentioned isn't such a deal breaker for me, especially because of how tasty their pizza is.  Haven't tried the regular crust yet because we got the Sicilian our first time, and it was so good, that we've kept getting it since!  Docking one star for the limited topping options and the fact that we've had to wait 5-10 minutes after they said it would be ready a couple of times."}
{"text":"I can already tell you that my pizza in my backseat is going to be absolutely phenomenal. I had a piece of the Sicilian white pizza while I was waiting for my pizza to come out of the oven, and it was absolutely fantastic delicious pizza.  The folks behind the pizza counter: super nice, super cute, a little flirty. I like it.   I'm definitely going to be a regular, super happy that this spot exists on the northside, a much-needed addition. Everything looks super fresh the storefront is super clean and well-maintained, parking is no issue out front on federal, and the hoagies the guy was putting together behind the counter looked really good too.  For the slices they put out, they have a three topping rule, which I think is a sure sign that these folks know what they're doing, after three toppings it's like a garbage disposal pizza."}
{"text":"This is in my opinion, this is the best pizza in Pittsburgh. Although I love just about everything about Pittsburgh, we are not a pizza town. This pizza is a true New York style pie with fresh ingredients. I have been going here for a few years now and the quality is consistent. On top of the great pizza the staff is always friendly and the place is alway clean."}
{"text":"One of only a handful of pizza places I have found in Pittsburgh with true New York style pizza. Thin crust, with sauce that is spot on an not too sweet like is often the case with many pizzas around here. High-quality toppings. Have had three pizzas from here so far and have been very impressed. It can get busy as with many good pizza places on the weekend. Otherwise one of my several go to pizza joints."}
{"text":"I'm a Jersey native that just recently moved to Pittsburgh. Finding a good New York style pizza had been a bit difficult since moving in. I was so thrilled when Badamos opened up. After trying about a million other pizza shops in the city, this is by far the best if you're looking for authentic NY thin crust pizza. The crust, sauce, cheese EVERYTHING is amazing. Even their ranch is house made and so good.   The staff is super friendly and personable. Cannot recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the burg.  This is a Pittsburgh 10, or a NYC 8.  Really good pizza, chewy crispy crust with the small pepperonis.  Must try, no room to eat there."}
{"text":"So excited to have badamo's on the North Side. Easily some of, if not the best pizza in Pittsburgh! Sauces are super tasty, crust is perfectly chewy and flavorful and toppings are ample and quality. Nice renovation with some room to eat a couple slices. Service is super friendly. I'll be here often for sure."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza-by-the-slice.  I ate at Badamo's today after reading about it in Pittsburgh Pizza's Instagram page, and it is as good as he says. It's my favorite slice place now (sorry, everyone on Murray Avenue). And not expensive: 1 slice regular w/pepperoni, 1 slice Sicilian plain, and a bottle of water was $6.05.   Badamo's, you're out of my way, but I will be back."}
{"text":"This is quickly becoming my favorite pizza shop. Not only is their pizza delicious and perfect, their salads are chock full of fun toppings with a homemade ranch that takes it over the top. Super friendly staff that are happy to chat away the minutes that you are waiting for your cuts. Such an awesome addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I am a pizza enthusiast. I've worked in the industry for years and have had probably 30 pizza shops in this city. It's this place or fioris on a good night. Don't bother going anywhere else. The sauce cheese and dough are top notch. I also love cream soda and they have some cane sugar in a glass bottle. Now I'm gonna order..."}
{"text":"All around an amazing pizza place! We have had this a few times and it has always been quality food!"}
{"text":"Taste is really good, crust is crunchy.  Maybe could add more cheese to a thin slice.  Sauce is good, especially for those who don't like a sweet taste to the pizza sauce.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Crispy, thin crust and all of the impulsive sides or toppings you'd want in a good slice. My favorite is the Sicilian square cut. They also do hoagies and salads, everything fresh and made from scratch and good enough to eat too fast so you end up burning the roof of your mouth and honestly you don't even care because there's another bite left and you know you'll complain about it later but is that a meatball hoagie on the menu and did that guy just order a pepperoni roll how do I get in on this I only ordered a slice of mushroom and a garlic knot??  In a city full of polarizing pizza opinions, Badamo's pizza has quickly become a top contender for Best Slice. Anthony Badamo brings all of the love and heart and taste of a solid New York style pizza joint with a supportive smile and a genuine interest in his customers, his employees, and his product.  People have been raving about the Mt. Lebanon location for years--I love it, too, but it's quite the long distance relationship for someone that lives in the city. Badamo's Pizza is doing a dope thing bringing a set of awesome standards to affordable food and expanding to serve as many people as they can in Pittsburgh. Can't wait to order here for the rest of my life, or at least until they open up a third location even closer."}
{"text":"Honestly: I was super excited to have a cool looking pizza joint in the Northside finally. Buuuuut.... they don't deliver, and quite frankly I don't feel that the pizza is that top notch.   It's good pizza. But then, so is Chubby's, Pizza Riviera, Doughboys, Cerasoli's, etc.   It's nothing special. I'll probably add it into the rotation if I'm near Federal and can pick it up."}
{"text":"Nice little shop that is primarily take out.  There is a small stand up counter you can eat at.  Staff was friendly and helpful to a few of the customers that had questions.  The pizza is thin crust with a little chew and good sauce.  Definitely a place for a couple of slices or sandwich when in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Love the pizza! It's delicious with tons of flavor ! White pizza has flavorful ricotta and seasoned perfectly"}
{"text":"Delicious NY style pizza.  Crust is fantastically thin and crispy with just enough cheesiness that you get with NY style pizza.  So glad there is finally a good pizza option in the North Side.   Definitely puts Giovannis to shame.  The only critique is to not be so stingy with your toppings."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza! Much needed on this side of town. We ordered a 16\" pie to take home- pepperoni, onion and banana peppers. The inside of the place is cute and a great place to eat a quick slice at the window counter, there are no tables. Crisp crust, great flavor. I'm trying the square Sicilian pizza next!"}
{"text":"Badamo's is a welcome business to the North Side! It's wonderful to have a true \"New York style\" pizza in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Ordered a large supreme pizza. With olives on only half. And steak hoagie. Waited the 30 mins they said it would take and went to pick it up. Waited another 40 mins at restaurant to get it.  Gave me a ice cold Sicilian pizza that only had olives on one half and no other toppings that was over baked and black in a lot of places.  First and last time going there.  The hoagie was trash."}
{"text":"Ok...I really love this place BUT could you please stop burning the pizzas ? Past two orders of Sicillian have been burnt. It truly takes away from the flavor of the cheese and sauce.   Please stop burning the pizzas."}
{"text":"Really, really good pizza - and finally so close to home for me!!!  The thin crust red pizza - very traditional NY style pies - huge and reasonably priced - crust is fabulous!!!  Can't wait to try a white pie next!!!  And the Sicilian crust too!!!  The salads are huge and delicious!!! Also tried the Italian hoagie - mostly very good but I'm not a big fan of mortadella - but will definitely try other varieties!!"}
