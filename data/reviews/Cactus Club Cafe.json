{"text":"Amazing food and drinks. I've tried multiple main courses on the menu and was never disappointed.  Always happy to go there and would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Went on a few occasions. Easily able to get a table after work for drinks and snacks. Recommend their Pims cup but they have a good selection of wines and cocktails. Also recommend their tuna stack (tartare), it's super fresh tasting comes with chips and makes a great sharing plate."}
{"text":"1 star for no waiting area and helpless waitresses, aside from that the waiting time is 45-60 min, imagine that without proper sitting area. The food is good I would give a 5 to that but since the first day they opened the portions have shrinked. The ones in Vancouver are waaaay better."}
{"text":"This is 3.5 stars review.   Went to Edmonton & Vancouver locations over past couple years. Always feel impressed with their food quality and good customer service. Pretty high expectations when Eastern flagship location finally opens up after long wait.   Went with hubby for dinner, not fully packed upon arrival maybe due to rainy day.   We ordered tuna tataki as starter, fish taco, butternut squash ravioli with jumbo prawns, and single caramel chocolate mousse for dessert. (Wine of course)  Fish taco is great, thin layer of beer batter wrapped pretty fresh lingcod fillet inside a soft taco. Compared with Edmonton & Vancouver locations, I'd say this is very consistent quality item on their menu.  Caramel chocolate mousse comes with warm dedicated caramel foam on top of chocolate mousse and crunchy sponge toffee. Hubby said he doesn't mind paying extra $2 for THIS caramel foam to replace regular whipped cream at Starbucks if it is available.   Taste of butternut squash ravioli with prawns is just ok compared to Vancouver location. Prawns are one size smaller in Toronto. Although truffle butter sauce compliments well with rich butternut squash mascarpone ravioli, they aren't \"al dente chewy\", need to cook one more minute to achieve perfection. I'd rate Vancouver location one star higher on this item.   Tuna tataki... I totally understand albacore tuna taste pretty similar to chicken; however, when sliced to a thin piece of about 0.4 centimetres, it definitely needs some fatty to let tuna melt in one's mouth.   Overall, I am still happy with Cactus Club opened up in Toronto. Just hope they iron out some wrinkles to make this business superb 'cause who doesn't like to share quality food with loved ones. ^_^"}
{"text":"A great place to go for supper. the dining area in the evening is usually kept very dim (reminds me of moxies) which gives a nice ambiance. Careful not to walk into the glass walls tho. The food is always superb with many dishes created by Canadian chef Rob Feenie. Always amazing but a little on the pricey side ($$$). If your looking for a good steak, this is the place however steak is redundant in my opinion- try the many other creative menu selections as i'm sure you'll have no trouble finding something. Service is good, as in expect to be asked how the meal is and if you need your drinks topped up every 10 mins or so. Otherwise A great choice for that odd occasion. I'd give 5 stars but the high price knocks it down one star."}
{"text":"I've been here so many times!! They failed me once for no seating available!! Over all, service are excellent, great food and good wine!"}
{"text":"The food here is great. The scene is great and the beer and drink selection is better than expected. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"The district manager emailed me back saying he would get in touch, but I never received a phone call. This is by far the worst customer service I have ever experienced."}
{"text":"I came here back in June of 2015 with a group of 20 people. Wasn't too busy and service was good. We were all treated really well. I'm from the East coast and we don't have Cactus Club. I am back on the west coast and I decide to go there again because of how good it was in June. I get there and have a 40 min wait (which is understandable). I finally get to my table and ask for a cup of ice. I brought a bottle of Sprite with me because I don't drink out of fountain machines. A man who was a worker comes over to my table and said he was very upset that I brought a bottle in with me and if I wanted a drink I needed to order it from them. He made a really big deal out of it and it was really  uncalled for. I felt like this time around I was being judged by the workers by the way I was dressed and I was being treated as if I was someone that didn't fit into their standards. The food was BLAH. Not the best not the worst but definitely not worth the money. I will never go back here."}
{"text":"The 4 of us down we went to CACTUS!!!! Great great atmosphere, chill and great friendly service all around. Kelly was our waitress and she was zzz bome!!! Super and fun waitress.  We had lots of appetizers and couple main courses.  Musts:carpaccio, TUNA TATAKI,CEVICHE,sliders, ravioli and shrimp,VEAL + PORCINI PAPPARDELLE.   For desserts:VELVET UNDERGROUND and port wine.  Guys trust me... The food was off the charts.  10/10.  One of my favorite Restaurants.  Must place to go."}
{"text":"Located a convenient drive from the airport, this Cactus Club Cafe is by far my favourite place to deal with, and dispense of, obligatory meetings with family on their way out of, or into, the city.  Think a little hipper, more upscale Moxie's. The interior is sleek and chic and open, and anytime I've been there, packed. As you walk in, don't be alarmed when you're greeted by about a half dozen hostesses - it's just how they roll at the Cactus Club.  Whenever I'm there, I opt for the Cajun Chicken Sandwich, which comes with sea salted fries - it's never let me down. My lady swears by their yam fries, and I too can attest to their deliciosity. They have a varied menu which caters to everyone, from vegetarians to strict carnivores. All of the guests that I've taken there over the years have left full and satisfied with their food. So, in other words, I have focus-grouped this place, and the findings are unanimous - it's most definitely good and worth the trip!"}
{"text":"CC is one of my absolute FAVs. I find the atmosphere nice, definitely has a Joey's and Moxies feel to it. The food is wonderful.  Here is a list of the items I have tried over and over again over the past 7 years +  APPI's: -Calamari: flavorful and a decent amount is served!  -Yam fries: so crispy and tasty...let me emphasize...SO TASTY!  -Thai chicken wings: a MUST try...by far my favorite kind of chicken wings  -West coast pockets: A really different taste, sort of similar to sushi...not sure if I love these. Maybe like, but not enough to order again    DINNER: -Jambalya: so so good, I haven't tried else where, maybe I should for a comparison  -Cajun Chicken sandwich: A great option if you like chicken burgers. Really nicely done. Simple, yet tasty.  -Crembule chicken dish: SOOOOOOO tasty!!! Only once did it come out blackened like a midnight sky...I had to have it sent back. Other than this one slip up, CC chefs know what they are doing   I have had different experiences with the service over the years. Mostly good though. On a side note-the servers are beautiful, no need for the done up looks. Hopefully they know this!"}
{"text":"We took a chance and managed to get a table on a Sunday night.  The meal was wonderful!  The tuna stack starter was one of the best things I've ever eaten!   Also had the duck club sandwich, truffle fries, and shared the key lime pie and lava cake.  Everything was delicious.  Can't wait to eat here again!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far, once for lunch and once for dinner. Cactus Club is the latest popular place to be in the financial district, with people pouring in to try it out.   Try to make a reservation, especially for lunch if you are here during your lunch hour. We were told it would be a 30 minute wait for a table, but luckily there were seats available at the bar - we had to ask for this though as the hostess wasn't even aware of the available seats until she went to check.   Overall, Cactus Club is overhyped and overpriced. My experience on both visits have been fairly average. I had the crispy chicken sandwich and the short rib sandwich, both of which were good but not outstanding. There's not much to draw me back other than convenience."}
{"text":"Came for summerlicious. Great atmosphere, great food and great service. Unlike many other places, they realize that many summerlicious crowds come in to check places out. It shows that staff members care. Nice portions, amazing food and other dishes also look great. For sure we will be back."}
{"text":"Went with my family (+kids) on a Sunday! We've been looking forward to eating here since their announcement of the opening in Toronto. We love the CC in Vancouver, so we were excited to have it here. Service and food was amazing! We had Krista as our server, who was very attentive and never left our glasses empty. She was compassionate towards our young children and catered to all of us as a fast-paced family. We quickly ordered the calamari, butternut squash ravioli (a must try!), teriyaki rice bowl and jambalaya rice bowl. It was a fantastic experience! Food was amazing, ambience was great on a Sunday (family approved) and the standard of service is just the best! Looking forward to going back with the kids."}
{"text":"This is my 6th time at this location. I love this restaurant!!!!!  Always delicious. Very sweet, helpful waitresses ( I'm a woman so has nothing to do with cute or not cute). Steak, special chicken dish with mushrooms, drinks, desserts- everything is always outstanding. I always take out the special chicken dish for my dinner the next day!!! Ummmm!   Tonight I took out their dessert as well. My little Yorkshire Roco ( 4 lbs ) was home too long alone. 5 hours as I went for a blow dry and shopped a bit at TD MALL before dinner. My husband loved his spareribs ( without the bones ) with the most sumptuous mashed potatoes and snap peas!  Too bad he only got to eat 2 snap peas before I stole every single one off his plate, it didn't bother him at all but I did have to give him my asparagus!! The martini ( the only one with Malabou Rum in it is sooooo good, I had to have 3 of them - no buz from the drink just a bit of low percentage of alcohol in the Malabou rum!    The very polite,  efficient,  helpful, wonderful manager is always walking around stoping at tables it's now 10th times we went back and service is amazing, could not be better!!! The waitresses are ALL incrediably friendly and efficient!!  There is atleast 1 (one) other Cactus Cafe - it's very very good but we really like this one better! it is Cactus Club on 39th Ave. Bonne Apetite!! Oh as for menu - EVERYTHING IS DELICIOUS and I'm not kidding."}
{"text":"5 star on the update because Jessica Chiu from Cactus Club guest relations took care of the mishap. It's nice to see management taking care of their customers when something goes wrong."}
{"text":"Supper was amazing! We had the beef short rib & Creole chicken that they spilt onto two plates evenly for us. It was a nice atmosphere and great service."}
{"text":"we went to cactus with my friend and family  on my daughter's birthday  dinner , we ordered six apt , all apt was great !!  after everybody enjoyed full meal . we had  really good food and great desert . I  went that location first time . we have very kind and friendly service ! I love to visit again !!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The burger was surprisingly good. A low 4 or a high 3. Nice house sauce, a little bit of colour left in the patty with a good bun. It wasnt over or under seasoned and had a decent crust, probably done on a flat top. The fries are thin and boring: they did the job but werent my cup of tea."}
{"text":"In LOVE with everything about this place! The decor and ambience of this place is very young and modern. The staff are bubbly and prompt, all very friendly and helpful. I ordered the fish tacos which came with an array of dips and guacamole for a small charge. Everything was excellent and one of my favorite meals in Toronto. We were there at dinner time on a saturday night which meant the restaurant was completely filled but they seated us right away. This was by far one of my favorite stops in Toronto! absolutely recommend."}
{"text":"The reason I am giving a 1 star rating is not because the food or drinks weren't good, but because the hostess and the manager were both quite rude when we had come in. The hostess just kind of stared at us questioning why we there almost and then told us to go to the manager who was unaccommodating when we asked about seating politely. When we finally left, the hostess didn't bother to say anything to us. Very poor customer service and not a great experience overall."}
{"text":"Second time at the new location. I've enjoyed the Vancouver locations especially the Coal harbour location as I frequent the Pac Rim.  I went for a few beers and to watch some sports with a buddy at the bar. The manager chose to tell us that they are food forward and if we are not ordering food we'd have to leave. They are not a bar. I've worked within a block of 8th ave restaurants for 15 years and wish them luck with that policy. Love everything but the smarty pants manager. Won't be back unless the wife makes me."}
{"text":"The restaurant has a very nice ambience and sleek washrooms.  The food is delicious - and the prices are also very similar yet it feels you get food that tastes better than a Joeys or Earls.  The desert menus has made in house that is highly recommend - these are not bought frozen and then resold.  The staff is also attentive."}
{"text":"The hostesses are so rude! I don't mind waiting for the lounge when it's busy but don't be rude about it and when I ask if I can order a drink while I wait..they walk away and ignore us. I enjoy going to the Barlow location. Not Stephen Ave."}
{"text":"Just had the braised short rib with snap peas...fantastic! The short rib you could cut with your fork and the snap peas were awesomely seasoned :) I will be back"}
{"text":"Cactus Club Cafe has been a favourite of mine since it first opened in Calgary, I have eaten here hundreds of times over the years and had only two bad experiences, once mentioned to our waitress they were fixed up immediately and in a manor that has become a standard very few restaurant's measure up to. My favourites here are the hamburgers for lunch, hot wings, make sure to ask for the creamy Parmesan dip, chicken Caesar salad, the RIBS.... mmm, there was once a pork chop they served, only had it for a few weeks, said it was to difficult to cook due to its thickness, so they pulled it from their menu (it was by far the most amazing dish I have ever had) it would just melt in your mouth and make you melt along with it. It took something like 40 minutes to prepare, I would wait twice as long for that dish."}
{"text":"Omg the Tuna Stack (appetizer) was AMAZING. I was really hesitant because the tune is raw (I'm scared of raw fish) but the waitress - Viola really convinced me and WOW, I LOVED it!! The staff was super friendly and welcoming, service was GREAT! Atmosphere was great as well. Definitely would recommend. I also had the ravioli, that was okay, nothing special, would not recommend. But 9/10 overall."}
{"text":"My favorite place for all time of the day.. the have a delicious truffles fries yummy yummy... also the service is amazing"}
{"text":"As the rating says, I'm a fan... The Jambalaya is great and the calamari app. is a must try. Seventh time here and not a bad meal to date, love the steaks and the cocktails are always mixed to perfection... The service is always with a smile, but the meals are a bit slow to get to the table, order that cocktail.  Try it today, yesterday is to late."}
{"text":"For anyone that enjoys flight delays, waiting past your appointment time to see your doctor, or being left on hold when calling government services, then Cactus Club is the place for you, because they have perfected the art of waiting and lining up! Line up to get in, fair enough, wait 3 hours for a table when the estimated wait was an hour and half, I guess they round up. Ask to go to the rooftop bar while you wait, you can wait in another line, and then can only access a portion of the rooftop bar called the \"cocktail tableling\" area, this is the equivalent of  waiting in a VIP line, only there is a VVIP line, so jokes on you patron. But aside from that, the service is pretty good and people thank you for waiting with a smile at every chance they get.   I think I understand why it is called the Cactus Club after all, cactuses can wait around and live without water to survive, so do the customers of this place."}
{"text":"It was a rainy day today and my friend and I walked in with hopes to either get a table or sit at the bar for a drink as the rain passed. The hostess said there was five people ahead of us but we were welcome to go to \"the deck\".  When we got upstairs it was PACKED (both lower floors were empty) the hostess up there greeted us saying we were welcome to find a seat at the bar or stand around... We would've been the only ones standing with a drink in our hands...  So we left without a hostess saying goodbye."}
{"text":"Very Pleasant Surprise  I was at cactus club on a Thursday night.  Intially it was exactly what I expected ... high energy, crowded to capacity with the Financial District  crowd.  However I quickly found that this place was different from the typical big box mid range bar/resto (think earls, joey,  moxies etc) First the service was exceptional, absolutely every person  I interacted with went above and beyond my expectations, making me feel that I was the most important customer (or at least as important as the VIP private party on the 3rd floor deck) special mention to Nicole who was amazing and went the extra mile to send exec chef Rob Feenie out to say hi when we told her that we were big fans.   Food was great, delectable with subtle flavors,  yet accessible for all palates.  Also enjoyed the love dj. Great energy  I am a fan... I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Went on a rainy Thursday evening/night for a friend's birthday gathering, and sat in a booth on the second floor. They were very accommodating to our reservation as a few girls were late because of heavy traffic due to the weather and accidents, so we really appreciated that. I ordered \"Rocket Salad\" with parmesan crusted chicken breast, arugula, vine tomatoes, red onion, lemon caper dressing. And a glass of white wine, and then a frose. The food was good, and I enjoyed my drinks. The music was a little loud, but not unreasonably so. Service was ok. My complaint is that it was SO dim that I couldn't see my plate. The small candles surrounding the table didn't illuminate our dinners at all. Photos that others have taken on this site (seated inside at night) can attest to that. Not in a rush to be back, but I'd like to see the patio during the day and have another frose."}
{"text":"Short Story: Rude waiter, decent food  Long Story: I decided to come on a Friday night for dinner with a couple of friends. We came as walk-in and were told the wait was an hour. They texted us in 30 mins saying the table was ready. We got a nice booth. The ambience was nice, intimate and upbeat. I was feeling optimistic about my night, as I was excited about coming here for a long time. The food was sub par. As a vegetarian there were slim to non options, ordered the veggie burger which was nothing special. The truffle fries were amazing! Highly recommend. The waitress (let's just say her name started with a M like Hannah ... ). She was really nice at first! However, once we asked for separate bills, her attitude completely changed. She stated that asking for separate bills was \"too much\" and gave us a \"warning\". Really?! What waiter says that to their customers?? TIP PAYING CUSTOMERS!!! Next when we decided to pay for the bill, she forced my friend to choose the tip % options or \"numbers on the screen\", basically forcing to pay a high tip which frankly she did not even deserve! She didn't even spilt the appetizers and dessert that my friends and I shared. Lastly, she forgot to bring requested salt to the pasta. Thank you Montana for making our night! We will definitely come again and recommend you as a server to all our friends. ;)"}
{"text":"NO SPIKED FRAP??! The menu is completely different from the Cactus Clubs in the west, which was fine. The food is amazing regardless of my nostalgic taste buds. TO location is beautiful and the staff are all very professional. HOWEVER, NO SPIKED FRAPS... Please Please Pretty Please, someone put that onto the drink menu X"}
{"text":"3:5! We went on a Friday night without reservations. I arrived at 7:15 pm - and was advised that the wait would be 40 minutes for upstairs dining. At 8 pm we were reminded it would be another 5-10 mins. At 8:30 pm someone came by and said there was an issue with the reservation system and it would be another 30 minutes if we wanted a table upstairs. Alternatively, we could get a table on the ground floor immediately. We proceeded with the latter option and we were seated in the corner with a cold draft. After 15 minutes we requested to move as we were too cold to enjoy the night. Finally- about 1.5 hours after arrival- we ordered food. The Szechuan chicken lettuce wraps and mini burgers are great starters! Both were delicious. As a main, I recommend the Baja fish tacos! If it wasn't for the wait the food would have received a 4/5, but despite being compensated for the delay, we were still disappointed. If you go- make reservations otherwise you may wait as long as an hour"}
{"text":"We were looking for a resto near the Hilton Garden Inn, and their menu was enough for us to give it a chance. Ordered Mini Burgers to start, which were excellent, juicy & flavorful. I had the BBQ Duck Club, which was a massive sandwich on, of all things, raisin bread ... spectacular flavor! My wife had the Szechuan Salmon, which she was also very pleased with. Service was excellent considering we hit it in the middle of lunch. If we were locals, I'd definitely keep it on the go-to list of restaurants!"}
{"text":"Kinda small compared to other Cactus Clubs i have been to.  The food was above average.  Reminded me of Joey Tomatoes or a similar restaurant.  The staff are appropriate and well mannered."}
{"text":"Disappointing.   Food, is good and service is good but too \"needy\".  I was asked \"How's it Tasting\" about 6 times.    The drinks were lousey.  Lots of booze but didn't taste good.    Next time I'm travelling I'll do Earls or Keg for something I can count on."}
{"text":"We usually belly up to the bar and order appies and drink! It's a really HOT spot and great place to mingle and meet new people.  I love the atmosphere at all Cactus Clubs but this one is uber trendy and super funky!    The outdoor patio in the summer is FANTASTIC!!  The only reason I don't give it a 5 is the menu is a bit small and not so many choices on the menu.    The fav thing on the menu are the dumplings! To die for!"}
{"text":"My husband and I frequent this location and it is a favorite. Food is always great and Kirsten is our favorite waitress,she is on mat leave but is awsome.The Sangria is amazing and now serve it all year round."}
{"text":"My steak was really salty? Thought it was just me but had my husband taste it and he agreed."}
{"text":"If you get the blonde waitress on the first floor you're doomed.  She will always get your oder wrong. Been there 3 times and had her every time and ever single time something was wrong with my order. Otherwise great food great atmosphere...as long as you don't get her u will love it"}
{"text":"It was nothing short of hooliganism what i witnessed by the staff. While i stood the by bar, this person was looking for some space at the bar counter pushed me off the counter INTENTIONALLY and i felt like he wanted to hurt me. I showed my displease and he threatened me to throw me out for  \"disrespecting the manager\". Yes he self identified himself as the MANAGER of the place. I told him there was no need to push whatsoever and there was an argument and i refused to leave. He asked the bouncers to bring me to a corner. Luckily for me, i got lost in the crowd while they were taking me wherever and i just left the place. I am never going back and don't recommend it to anyone. I don't want the management to contact me. I have nothing to speak to you about."}
{"text":"Amazing food, very friendly staff, great drinks! My husband and I had such a good time here, we recommend it! 10/10 for you, guys!"}
{"text":"5 stars just cause im never dissapointed here...service is great! You gotta try the 4 mushroom steak !!! My favorite"}
{"text":"Friendly service. Great food.   I have been here a few times and I have tried their Tuna Club, Yam fries(comes with delicious garlicy dip...) and Veggie burger.   I think my favorite was a veggie burger.. I believe it is called a garden burger."}
{"text":"Went for a girls night out... This place had a good ambiance... Customer service was excellent.... Our food came out sooner than expected even when the restaurant was fully packed... Substitutions were easy to make... I got the Ravioli which was on point... The sauces was nice and buttery... One of my friend got a chicken burger which looked delicious and tasted really good... Got the Baja fish tacos which were really good as well.  Another r of my friends got the lamb with the introduction chutney... That was by the favorite dish for the table as it was very flavorful and lamb was tender and juicy... Will come again.... Would recommend for a first date as the place has an extremely good vibe..."}
{"text":"Just finishing lunch with the family. Great food, very fresh. Service is excellent. We are all happy we came!"}
{"text":"Whenever I go to Calgary, I always make it a point to eat at Cactus. The food is great. The service is fine and the servers are friendly.  The ambiance is a bit noisy though. Lighting is on the dark side to have room for privacy.  I brought my colleagues to this place and they loved."}
{"text":"Cajun chicken was very good.  Asparagus in particular got rave reviews.  Braised short ribs and sirloin steak cooked to perfection. Teriyaki chicken rice bowl was average.  Too much soya sauce over powered the vegetables, rice, and chicken.  Wor wonton soup was average. Won tons and broth were over salty."}
{"text":"Great experience overall. Staff was great. Very attentive and look like they are enjoying their job. I had the spaghettini and Kobe meatballs. I was pleasantly surprised. Great taste and portion was just right. Looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"I've been to two location in Calgary. Wow. What a great place to be. The atmosphere and service are amazing, food taste great and very reasonably priced. Keep up a great job. Highly recommend for lunch or meeting with the client."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants we've been at in years! The duck and lentil dish was wonderful. Lentils were some of the best. Service was great. They found us a table without a reservation, but recommend you make a reservation."}
{"text":"Cactus Club is one of those places that I would go to only because the friend I'm going with is not adventurous. I don't have anything bad to say about this place, but I am not raving about it either. Most things on the menu can be found at other similar restaurants. Spicy chicken appies, calamari, fish tacos, etc.  The one thing that does stand out are their burgers. It seems to be the only thing that is different in the menu. First, their buns - mmmm. Second, they put a slaw in the burger that makes it so deliciously Americanesque.  With that said, I MUST point out one thing: Their Gluten-Free menu is not a menu of gluten-free options. It's THE menu but with all the gluten cut out. For example, \"teriyaki rice bowl, no teriyaki sauce.\" How can you have a teriyaki rice bowl without the teriyaki sauce? It would just be a rice bowl! And a burger with no bun? It would just be a meat patty with toppings! I don't get it.  To sum it up. The food they prepare is prepared well, but I'm not crazy about their menu."}
{"text":"Great service, and great prices! The duck sandwhich is a must! It's the best sandwhich I've ever eaten. The Prawn and Butternut Squash ravioli is also incredible!   You can be fancy or casual and it will always be a great dining experience!"}
{"text":"The service was really good. Our waitress was very attentive.  The appetizers came right away and the food soon after."}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant with great atmosphere. Our server was very friendly and knowledgable about the menu items. I had the salmon and my husband had a steak. Both entrees were prepared to perfection. We will definitely return next time we are in Calgary."}
{"text":"Take your corporate parties somewhere else, maybe next door to the Met.   Few points:  The waiting time is terrible.  I go to the front desk, and the hostess, just ignores me. We waited for 43 minutes (just confirmed the time).   We see people walking in, empty tables for 6 but they can't sit us there. Someone had a reservation... Well, we called on Monday and they told us they did not take reservations. Contradiction?  It seems as if this place prefers to keep empty tables to pretend they are busy.  We try to get our order in to see if they hurry up and start processing it so by the time we sit down we wont have to wait. The Hostess replies: \"Sure, we can have it for take out\".   I would strongly advise to take your corporate events somewhere else!"}
{"text":"My fav place in the city. Still have some of the best food and service in the area. I admittedly only stick to the steaks, but my wife eats the seafood dishes. For both of us, this is the one place that is always good, as we've been there many times, and will be back.  Perfectly cooked steaks, everytime.  For dessert, nothing better than the peanut butter bar......"}
{"text":"Let me start by stating \"CACTUS CLUB in Toronto is HORRIBLE HORRIBLE PLACE!!!  We booked a reservation for tonight - Dec 16, 2017 dinner for a party of 10 ... to celebrate my birthday, etc. This reservation was booked over a month ago because I like to plan ahead.  Today, we get a call from the restaurant saying they can only accommodate 8 people, and the restaurant is completely full. Of course I went livid!  Speaking with the staff over the phone is useless because they are no help. All they can say is, \"there's nothing we can do, sorry!\"  Are you kidding me??? An establishment like Cactus that has several locations across the country, they really need to train their staff better. Customer Service and Customer Experience is huge!!!  I hope the owner of Cactus will read this review - Cactus is now written off my books because of this horrible experience. The customer-facing staff you hire do not represent your company in a good way, well unless your culture is to give distasteful experience to consumers, then your staff are all aces! THANK YOU FOR NOTHING!!!"}
{"text":"A favorite of mine having lived in Vancouver where they originated. This one has been opened for 5 months. I saw two floors, very different, great bars, same fantastic menu and the staff are absolutely wonderful. Valentine's Day was sure to be a busy one but we were never rushed, and made to feel like the only patrons in the place. I wish I had gotten the name of our waitress as she was brilliant!! I would recommend this place over and over again and it's open late too! Well done Feenie."}
{"text":"Yearning for a good burger at a place that has been a consistent winner in previous visits to the BC area and close enough to YYC, I decided to stop by this location and ended up ordering the Feenie Burger for my very first time which is a popular item based on just one of the many dishes that is on the CCC menu from the former Iron Chef 2005 winner. Being a yank from the states, I tend to forget that in Canada all burgers are cooked well done (thank you Mad Cow disease) and  it's always a gamble whether the finished product will come out dry as I normally order my burgers medium rare. I must say, that in my many trips to Canada, this has never been the case when ordering a burger and CCC was no exception.  My burger was very juicy and the various condiments spot on (minus the bacon which I requested that it not be part of my order). Service was great however, I arrived after the lunch rush and sat in the lounge area at one of the many high top tables. Menu was typical of other CCC locations and perhaps it would be nice if they changed up some entrees every so often.  Although this location does not have the Coal Harbour, BC view and vibe of that area, I liked the fact that it is very close to YYC given the fact that the airport is still going through their major construction project."}
{"text":"The food is always fantastic, as well as the staff. My sister and I go here and have the teriyaki rice bowl, it's never been anything short of delicious!  We did have a waitress one night who forgot about our appy, and was not apologetic at all. But everyone has off nights right!? Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here on Sunday night.  The ambiance is very cool and pleasant.  Food was extraordinary!  Tuna Tower and lettuce wraps are just stellar for apps.  For dinner we had Duck Confit,  Asian short ribs and Butternut squash ravioli w Prawns.  All were worthy of 5 stars.  Was shocked to discover this is a part of a western Canadian chain. Top notch!!"}
{"text":"HOT spot!! Good wine/beer list, and dinner salads were just great. Sure entrees w/b also. CWG fr CT"}
{"text":"I've been here a million times and i love the experience everytime i come in here.  The food's amazing. Appetizers i love the Calamari. My personal favourite entre is the Jambalaya. For desserts i love chocolate lava cake.  Wine pairings are always amazing.  Kudos."}
{"text":"Came on a Monday evening with a friend for her birthday. We sat on the third floor enclosed patio and I can imagine that this place will be absolutely amazing once summer makes its way back to Toronto!  On the evening that we were there, the roof was closed but apparently they do keep it open even in cooler weather, however, they were having issues with it on that particular day. The ambience was great for socializing - it was dim, not too loud, and the DJ was playing a mix of mostly hip-hop and R&B, both old school and new (two thumbs WAY up for that). The restaurant is three floors and making our way up to the third floor, we saw that each level was packed even on a Monday.  Despite the great vibe, I would give the food 3 stars. We ordered the calamari to start which was good but nothing outstanding. I had their famous prawn ravioli which was quite forgettable; it was kind of bland and just plain meh. Nothing at all exciting. I tried a piece of my friend's filet mignon and it was a tad bit on the tough side. Her mashed potatoes actually tasted like they were of the instant variety. For dessert we had a chocolate mousse topped with some kind of foam - way too sweet for my liking and my friend barely touched hers. Wine by the bottle was very reasonably priced and we also tried their sangria and Brazilian cocktails. While both cocktails were good, they were also on the sweet side.  Customer service would earn this place 5 solid stars! From the hostess walking us into the elevator and actually pressing the button for us to our very genuinely nice server to the hostess upstairs and the bartenders, everyone was so friendly and helpful. They provided us with charging sticks for our phones and even reserved a spot by the bar for us when we said we wanted to stay for a few drinks after dinner. Overall, Cactus Club is an amazing place to hang out for drinks and apps but their food and drinks rank about on par with or just slightly below Joeys, so definitely nowhere near a fine dining establishment as they claim.  Looking forward to going back in the summer for drinks and the patio!"}
{"text":"Very nice place with many happy hour cocktail choices. I had the Kobe meatball spaghettini with a mushroom sauce. It was delicious and very filling. The outdoor patio was very ornate and the bathrooms were luxurious. The burgers were about average, but I really liked the sweet potato fries. Note that the garden burger is a veggie burger"}
{"text":"Visiting Toronto we passed this Cactus Club Cafe with fires outside, and so glad we stayed to eat there. Although music very youthful (volume) and dressy, we were welcomed in off the street in our very casual attire. The menu was wonderful. So delicious trouffle butter sauce squash ravioli from their separate Vegetarian menu was the best. Key lime pie fresh made delicious. We totally  enjoyed the atmosphere and the people are beautiful and so friendly. Salads so fresh and delicious and all not pricey . We recommend this to all."}
{"text":"I can't say if the food is good because I didn't have anything to eat. The reason for that is because I sat there for 15-20 mins for a waiter to come by and greet us. Every waiter just walked by and said nothing. Now we're across the street at Earls Kitchen &Bar. I've been greeted, seated, and brought water within 3 minutes."}
{"text":"Recently went in again. This time we sat on the 3rd floor on the patio deck. Loved the vibe.  We ordered the new york striploin and got it butterflied, it came with mashed potatoes and asparagus. Its not jacobs but definitely still good. We also had the shrimp ravioli. Hands down best ravioli ever but i do wish the portion was bigger"}
{"text":"Pretty great food quality considering it is a chain resto. Their happy hour prices are hard to beat, as we had three mini burgs/tacos and 3 drinks for just under $20 (plus tax and tip). Service was the perfect mix of professional, attentive and friendly.  Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Food was good but experience was extremely lacking.  Made reservations for a sunday for a nice dinner.  When my date and i showed up on time it took 15 minutes to \"prepare our table\".  Most of the restaurant was closed.  I made it clear this was for a nice  quiet dinner.   Instead all that was open was the bar area with people mostly drinking around us.  This should have been made clear upon making the reservation.   The only  saving grace was the braised ribs.  The butter nut squash and the spaghetti prawn pasta was nothing to get excited about.  Wont go back."}
{"text":"I have been here twice for happy hour, which used to be a decent deal. Sady they've increased their food prices and it's not such a good incentive to go here anymore. $4 for a small taco? No thanks! At least they were tasty.  My biggest complaint here are the girls at the front - they don't seem to know how to greet people in a decent amount of time...I've stood there with them looking in my general direction for many minutes before they greet me. I got the impression they talk to you only when someone is available to seat you - but come on, at least say hello!"}
{"text":"I respect a well run business when I see it.  The food is well above average and the staff are professional and well trained. If you are looking for a reliably good restaurant to visit, this is the one.  The noise level can be a little high in the evenings when the restaurant is full (and it usually is).  It takes a lot to get a 5 star out of me, but there is no question here.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"I had been to a Cactus Club in B.C. before, but since there are only a couple in Calgary, I had never been to one here.  When I had family visiting, I decided we should check it out.  We just went for appetizers and drinks before going to see a movie.  The place is small and busy, but we were able to get a table no problem.  The one must try at this place is their spiked frappes!  So very, very good and dangerous!  My Husband and I shared the potato skins and the chicken tenders, pretty uneventful.  The potato skins were very good, not greasy and they actually had some potato on them!  Our food was $10 each, my frappes were $7, my Husbands beer was $4.75 on special.  The waitress was very friendly and efficient.  I highly recommend both the spiked frappes and the Bellini's here, they are both absolutely delish!  This is a great place to go for dinner or drinks out."}
{"text":"Very happening place in the early evening.   The servce was great,very fast, and the food fantastic!! The prices were reasonable also. I Could'nt ask for more, execpt gorgeous waitresses.... oh yea, they had that too."}
{"text":"Food has always been great, we go there often. The wait can be long as the restaurant is pretty busy but the food never dissapoints.   Much better than Earls/Moxies etc."}
{"text":"Went here for some dinner after getting off a flight. Had the Szechuan chicken wrap as an appetizer, which was absolutely delicious. Then had the peach Bellini, which was also a delicious and refreshing new slushy drink. The hunters chicken, steak, and jambalaya bowl were also great, and the service during the whole meal was impeccable and some of the best i have ever experienced . Would definitely go here again."}
{"text":"Tried it for lunch today.  Service was excellent.  Friendly and professional, with just the right level of attention.  Had the Fish Tacos -- very nice.  Big pieces of fish, and a nice combination of flavors.  For dessert, tried the caramel mousse.  While the taste was OK, the texture and over-all combination did not work for me.  There was too much foam, the sponge toffee just drowned in the mousse, which was the consistency of thick chocolate milk and was definitely not mousse-like; it just felt unfinished."}
{"text":"Best lettuce wraps in the world! must try them   Overall, always get good services and great meals"}
{"text":"Great casual spot for tasty eats and an energetic upbeat atmosphere. Our server was friendly, attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. She recommended a great wine for our afternoon lunch. The three floors provide a grandeur feel with modern accents.  I highly recommend the BBQ Duck Clubhouse and the Jambalaya Rice Bowl!"}
{"text":"Cactus has it all. Food, wine, service and ambiance.  The Barlow service is better than Macleod Trail and the interior is fantastic. The management has done a great job of bringing architecture, art and function into a space.   Double Braised pineapple short rib is amazing; Rob's (Feenie) Hunter Chicken will convert any red meat lover; and when out of a suit I will have my fav the fajitas. The entire menu eats well.  The wine list is absolutely superb but avoid the \"Feenie\" blends like the plaque, wow are they ever bad. I'm not sure why Rob Feenie (Canada's only Iron Chef) would add his name to that swill."}
{"text":"My husband and I just had dinner here and WOW!  I had the double braised pineapple hoison short rib and my husband had jack daniels' ribs.  Both were amazing!  The lady who answered when we phoned for a take out order was sweet and recommended my dinner and then wonderful desserts which I don't normally have but they were both amazing as we shared the white chocolate cheesecake and  chocolate peanut butter crunch bar.  I will absolutely eat here again!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has everything going for it. It's clean, in a great location for those working downtown and has attractive atmosphere and staff. The vibe is youthful and professional but the service can sometimes be very \"business-like\" or uptight. The staff here seem to be less engaging and focused more on getting patrons in and out quickly. If you're one who's not too fond of the small talk or if you need a fairly private dining atmosphere, this is a great location for you. The dining room is reminiscent of cubicles as all the tables of 3 or more are secluded in booths with high partitions. It makes it very difficult to be seen or heard which can be a benefit for a corporate lunch meeting.  The food compares to other Cactus Club locations and is of high quality with large portions. The menu selection provides versatile options and interesting modifications to typical items, such as the Pesto Chicken Quesadilla (blended cheeses, basil pesto, sundried cranberries, honey lime dip) which is an interesting twist on a familiar menu item. The servers are well put together, professional and the service is of high quality. The food and drinks were appetizing and properly prepared in a timely manner.   If you want good food, and non-distractive service during a business meeting, this is a great downtown option for you. I would not recommend this location for date night or for children as it's lacking in visual stimulation and more upbeat, friendly, and engaging service techniques."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with 2 other co-workers. I had reservations for 10, but most of them bailed last minute (they missed out, oh well) and the waitress and manager (I presume) were really cool about. They didn't make me feel guilty for not bringing the majority of the guests. They even made some jokes about it.   The food was almost perfect. We split the ravioli for appetizer, which is one of their signature dishes. The balance of flavours was great and the pasta was cooked perfectly. The only bit of criticism would be it could have been hotter. For our mains, I ordered the creole steak and prawns; my guests ordered the porcini pappardelle and lamb chops. Both raved how good it was. I ordered my steak with the creole butter on the side, and therefore, it did have much of a creole flavour. I found even with the butter, it didn't add anything to the dish. The steak itself was perfectly cooked and season. The mash potatoes were rich and creamy.   Everything was great. Hope to return soon."}
{"text":"I had the kale and chicken salad, which was delicious! Who knew a kale salad could be so good? It was quite large, which was great since most of it was greens. I also tried my friend's chicken and lettuce wraps (Korean flavours, I think?) and they were great too. Was a bit skeptical about this place because it's right in the heart of the business district and restaurants can be meh if they are not super high end, but I was impressed by the food. It is a bit pricey for lunch most days (salad was 18$), but will go back for sure."}
{"text":"I had the rare opportunity to be invited here for a business lunch. Beautiful people, beautiful decor, beautiful food. Staff are well trained and you will see it in the little things such as how they take the ladies' orders first, how the water is served, how the cutlery is placed on the table and how they remember your order. I was in a party of 6 and everyone's food arrived at the same time, piping hot. Portions are big for Toronto, and the prices definitely reflect that. I had the calamari and the pan seared lingcod, both of which were delicious. The calamari is easily enough for 4 people so keep that in mind if you are looking for something to share. Didn't get a chance to check out the bathrooms but I'm sure they were beautiful too. Their post meal coffee was perfect. I must say that this place is pretentious so dress to impress! Would love to come back when I have some fun money."}
{"text":"I sat at the bar and was greeted promptly.  Friendly, engaging staff.  I had the fish tacos (grilled) and a kale salad on the side.  Both were fantastic."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time while visiting Calgary earlier this month. Although there was a little bit of wait to be seated, it was worth it. Me, and my girlfriends, decided to have a Friday's night out  (June 6th)  and we could not be happier with the food and service. Our server Jay was very friendly, helpful, with a great knowledge about food and drinks. Thank you, Jay! I had a great time and I will come back next time I am visiting Calgary."}
{"text":"Came for lunch. Reservations a few weeks before..highly recommend it! Food was not bad. Had the calarmari and baja fish tacos. Great big size portions. Came with 3 tacos and I was stuffed. Service was ok. Felt like we were rushed out as there was a huge lineup! Great rooftop patio! Great decor."}
{"text":"In a nutshell this place had a mixed bag of food and excellent service. Service gets 5 stars and food gets 3 stars (details below). For now it is also a cool Place To Be Seen, though my rating also ignores this fact.  Let me say first that the service was excellent. The servers knew what they were taking about, were friendly, were and practiced some \"higher end\" attentiveness, like replacing cutlery between appetizers and the main course, and refilling soft drinks automatically when glasses were getting low. My water glass was never empty for very long.  The apps were fine. We had the thai chicken and the butternut squash ravioli for apps. The chicken was the same as I've had anywhere else (lightly battered and fried, heavily tossed in a sweet and sticky chilli sauce) and the ravioli was a bit over salted but nonetheless tasty. I would be willing to try something new next time. Apps for me were 3 stars.  The mains were very good. I had the duck sandwich. Sweet fruit or raison bread mixed surprisingly (unsurprisingly?) well with the duck flavours. The bacon on the sandwich was very and crispy, providing more accent than flavour which is what you want, so this the main flavour you'll taste is the duck. Everyone else really enjoyed their sandwiches too (prime rib sandwich and burger). The fries were nothing special though nothing terrible too. 4-5 stars for the sandwich and 2-3 stars for the fries. Maybe next time I will try the salad and see what that's like.  On food alone I would give the cactus club a 3 but service tips the scale in its favour. As long as this place continues to provide excellent service it will continue to be successful. I will also add that this place is on the higher end of the price scale for what it is - for example $17.75 for a sandwich and fries is just high enough that it is not the worst when work is paying but pretty annoying for a personal meal. So basically if you're going to come here have an expense account."}
{"text":"Great food, awesome atmosphere and friendly staff. Def recommend this place for dinner or a night out."}
{"text":"Went here with some friends after work at peak time, it does get very busy so be sure to make reservations. The staff were friendly, not snobby like same upscale places.   The restaurant is very modern looking and has a really good vibe with a live Dj who was awesome (not sure if this is a daily thing).   I ordered the duck and it was alright, the food unfortunately was nothing exceptional and it was on the pricier end.   The overall atmosphere of the place is amazing though and it's a great place to grab drinks or just catch up with friends so I would definitely be returning."}
{"text":"This rating is more toward a 4 than a 3 but the venue is a little too cozy on the ground floor.   Food was great, had the Duck Confit, nothing special, decent, but wasn't as juicy as legs/dark meat should be. The beans and sauce though was really delicious and full of flavour. More a highlight than the Duck I'd say.   Had the yam fries as well. Just like all yam fries, amazing. Great sauce as well with just enough hint of kick.   Great place, great vibe, good staff, good downtown spot for the post work drink. The patio also has a mist going to help cool down which I think has been important this summer."}
{"text":"Okay I base my 5 stars on one dish.  One appetizer actually... The Tuna Tataki is amazing!  The tangy sauce it bathes in Fantastic!   Second favorite is the Jambalaya.  Oh and the Utter Ale does not disappoint.  And believe me I don't throw around my 5 stars all 'willy nilly'..."}
{"text":"You can only judge a restaurant by what crowd it is attempting to appeal to. While my \"cactus club\" type days are behind me, heck guverment was still open last time I was in Toronto, I think they are hitting their mark.    It was definitely happening for a Wednesday night with a very young and fashionable crowd.  The waitstaff was consisted of young beautiful staff that set the vibe.  Hip hop music was played by the in-house DJ.  This is definitely not the place to go if you want a relaxing dinner or to discuss business as it is more bar/club then steak house.    The food was average. It was a bad sign when I ordered the NY strip and the waitress didn't ask how I would like it cooked."}
{"text":"My friend and I ate here for an early dinner on Saturday night.  We were served by 4 different servers, which we found to be very odd.  I had the burger, and I was a bit disappointed with the size of the bun to the rest of the burger.  I don't think I would order another burger from the Cactus Club, I think I will stick to either their steaks or jambalaya which I know are good."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Great service.  From ribs to lettuce wraps to dessert...everything was great!"}
{"text":"I haven't found a bad thing to say of any Cactus Club location to date! It's my favourite casual dining chain.   I went here most recently to try their menu for The Big Taste restaurant festival. The appetizers were amazing. We tried the Kobe meatballs and the Ahi Tuna. My dinner date ordered the Rob's Hunter Chicken and I ordered their Salmon. I had tried both before and they didn't disappoint:) The portions of the main courses were full sizes, so their festival menu was a great value! For dessert they had the peanut butter bar. Yum Yum Yum .. I'm so happy they put their best dessert on The Big Taste Menu.. It made my night!   To wash down the wonderful meal we ordered cocktails ( the cohiba is my go-to) and wine recommended by our server, who was so nice and very helpful. Shout out to the server with the train tattoo on her arm!  It was a great night out! Thumbs up for Cactus Club:)  P.S. We were in the dining room but the lounge did seem pretty lively!"}
{"text":"I have been to Cactus Club many times and keep going back because of great food and experience. It is my favourite casual restaurant chain.  Most recently I came here with family on a Thursday night and we were seated quickly. Our server was very nice and personable and was so patient while my family contemplated menu choices.   We had a variety of drinks (the cohiba is always my favourite) and we enjoyed a few appetizers. The Rob's flatbread was recommended by our server and it did not disappoint. As a meal I enjoyed the Shortrib which was flavourful. However, not better than the Thai Lingcod which has remained my favourite dinner entrée there. All of the food came out great except for one dish which was cold. Our server took it back to the kitchen with no hesitation, apologized got a new one. Dessert was the peanut butter crunch bar which is a must have!!   Our family had a great night out and appreciated the great food and service at Cactus Club. I will keep going back and keep recommending it to everyone!"}
{"text":"Food was ok. I had better food with similar price range.   Then I got food poisoning from it.   Service was good. Friendly staff except the front desk. Food came at a good pace.   Decor and ambiance - loud music that barely able to talk ppl next to you.    Generally, its over the top.  i wont be back."}
{"text":"Good food. Excellent actually. Not very quiet, and dark atmosphere. But food was all solid!  Good and very well made. Service was exceptional as well."}
{"text":"Ok my first visit and I am very pleased. The carpaccio is amazing!!  Along with the tuna tataki and Szechwan beans it was a great visit to the Cactus Club. To top it all off we enjoyed a wonderful Bonarda an Argentina Tilia. As a final note my friend Jess loved the seasoned garlic toast!! All in all a great visit!! With great service too."}
{"text":"I frequent the Cactus Club. You could say I'm part of the club. Ninety percent of the time one hundred percent of the time I order the chicken tenders, no frills but dear god they're unbelievable. There is something to say about good chicken fingers. Today I ordered a cesar as one would on a Sunday. The first one was fantastic, but the second was lacking something....  I like the ambiance of the bar, there's always good looking people floating around. The service is consistently good. It's a place I don't mind killing a few hours. Not to mention the happy hour from 3-6 pm everyday is awesome.  I would recommend."}
{"text":"My parents and I came to Cactus club Cafe on more then one occasion and each time we go we get very friendly and welcoming service with a delicious meal that's never overly salty. Would recommend for a nice family dinner"}
{"text":"I normally can't stand the country of Canada, but when I came here for business I was forced to immerse myself in the local culture. I originally thought of Canadians as igloo-dwelling, dog-sled racing, curling fanatics, but I discovered quite the opposite. A few of my coworkers convinced me to attend a local establishment called Cactus the Club. Against all odds, I found myself enjoying the foreign cuisine by indulging in a steak and \"prawns\" dish that I found extremely entertaining. The steak was fine, but it took me 14 Google searches and 5 Ask Jeeves questions to learn that a \"prawn\" is actually a Canadian version of the popular seafood appetizer more commonly referred to simply as a 'shrimp'. I finally got over the fact that Cactus the Club wasn't trying to pull a fast one on me and savored every bite. I would recommend this restaurant for anyone who finds themselves lost in this foreign land, and is looking for a half-way decent meal for price equivalent of 10 Pesos. Bring your friends, invite your family, Cactus the Club has it all!"}
{"text":"For a chain, this place has great food. LOVE the butternut squash ravioli as well as the jerk chicken. Everything I have had has always been good but those are my favourites. Great drink specials as well."}
{"text":"We had gift card to this restaurant so we decided to try it for lunch on Saturday. Everything start to finish was really good. We had the spicy chicken, tuna stack and the shrimp ravioli to start each was equally delicious. For the main we had steak frites my steak was cooked rare perfectly, robs spicy chicken sandwich, and freebie burger. The waitress was really attentive refilled our water and drinks frequently. This place was really decent portion sizes we didn't even need to get appetizers before our meals! We were way to full to even attempt dessert. Cactus cafe is definitely a place we will be returning to in the future!"}
{"text":"???? ?????????main ?prawn spaghettini ? chicken hunter special starter??chicken wings?calamari?yam fries???????? ???? ?????"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was on point! Great staff. Food was the best we had in Calgary!! Next time in Calgary, I will be visiting this place hands down!!"}
{"text":"Best Dj ever, it was a Monday night and the place was lit. Fantastic vibe great ambiance awesome drinks and the food was terrific. Had the tuna tartare app n the chicken sandwich. Located on the roof top with an amazing view of Toronto."}
{"text":"The sweet potato fries weren't the best, a little dry. Drink was great, a bellini"}
{"text":"Now they don't call me picky pallete for nothing! And today I was pleasantly surprised  by this restaurant! We shared basic stuff, but it executed perfectly- dry ribs, salads, streak and the ravioli bites with prawns! Heavenly!!! But the best part was the service! Elissa---- such great service, more rare then I would like.  I'll be checking it out again very soon!"}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant! Not fancy, but also not pub like. Great drinks and incredible food! My favourites are the tuna tataki, and any of their steaks. Everything is perfect every time i go. Always great service as well! I come here regularly, and wont stop any time soon :)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing - specifically Thanna, the General Manager. The service, atmosphere and food were top notch (I'm from NYC so I have high expectations). Even better, which speaks to the GM and the organization as a whole, is the fact that my stolen phone was found by their staff. Rather than just take it, they contacted my wife and had it sent back to me. I cannot thank Thanna and the staff enough for their unbelievable professionalism. I'll be back every time I'm in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Great vibes, great atmosphere. Classy and great for last minute dinner and drinks, a date or just drinks with the girls. Great food, affordable and dress code is usually casual dressy. Reminds me a bit of joeys."}
{"text":"Our night started off pretty poorly I have to admit. We were seated fast and the hostess was friendly but once we got to our table we waited 30 minutes before asking a passing waiter if we could get some service. He apologized and took our order and brought us some water. I understand service being slow due to being busy but we were a little cheesed that no one had bothered to bring us water or even told us that they'd be with us right away. When we finally got some service our waitress was super friendly and the food was great! The reason I am giving 5 stars is because the Cactus Club kindly covered our bill. Apparently there was a mix up with the sections and I am glad to see a business that tries to fix their mistakes. Thank you Cactus Club!"}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try it, and I had the opportunity in Calgary . The food is amazing, we began with the yam fries for appetizers which was really good , I had the butternut squash ravioli which was so decadent and rich ( absolutely lived up to its reputation) and my husband had the Cajun chicken sandwich which he absolutely loved ( and he's REALLY picky when it comes to food) and I finished with the white chocolate cheesecake ( which wasn't all that special , to be honest) ..   Our waitress was very friendly and nice ( even though we got there at about 11 pm ) she did not seem in a rush at all to have us order and then out the door..  I LOVE it's open late!!! One of my favourite things about restaurants , seeing as how I'm a night person I really appreciate places that open to late hour .  But I gotta say, this is now one of my favourite places and I'll be DEFINITELY going back (this time I'll stay local and go to the Edmonton branch ) ."}
{"text":"Visited Cactus Club on a Friday afternoon at 2:00 and didn't have to wait for a table.    Beautiful spot that's located right off the food court at First Canadian place.  While our server Kelly was excellent and made some great recommendations, I'm on the fence as to whether or not the spot deserves all the hype.  Appetizer - we had the ravioli and prawn trio which was delicious, rich and so fresh.  We wanted to order more.  I had the cheddar bacon burger which wasn't anything special.  Toppings only made the burger soggy.  Friends had the fish tacos and the bbq duck clubhouse.  I should have gone with the duck as my friend couldn't stop commenting on how good it was.  We split the chocolate lava cake for dessert.  It was a little too rich for me and could have been store bought.  Drinks were tasty.  We had a dark & stormy, and a few Moscow mules.  I wanted to like this place more for what we spent ($180 for three including gratuity).  Overall it was okay."}
{"text":"I had no idea what kind of place this was when I walked in for a very late supper last Friday night. Wearing jeans and a Threadless t-shirt I felt a bit underdressed, but to be fair it was nearly 10:00 on a Friday night. The waitress recommended a Cedar Creek Merlot for a wine and it was quite nice. For an appetizer, we tried a flatbread with tomatoes, goat cheese and drizzled balsamic vinegar. It was so warm and fresh - yum. I had their jambalaya with brown rice as an entree. It was nice and spicy and very filling. We asked the waitress to surprise us with something for dessert and she brought out a warm apple-filled crepe topped with vanilla ice cream. The service was excellent and the atmosphere was great too. They also have some selections on their menu created by Canada's only Iron Chef. Their prices are a bit expensive, but not unreasonable."}
{"text":"Food and service was good overall. The portions were not mediocre. For the price you pay, it may be considered small but the restaurant is in a very good location downtown. The prices are on par.   I would've have given this a five star rating but they lost two stars because I felt the menu was very misleading. We came here for dinner and we were provided a regular menu and a second \"special\" menu printed on a thin sheet of paper. The second menu had all the same entrees as the regular menu with the same price, but included a wine pairing recommendation below each entree with a price next to it. Almost all the wine recommendations had a price that was around $10 more than the entree. For example if the entree was $25, the price next to the wine pairing would be $35. BEWARE! Perhaps it was poor judgement but I assumed that the second price below the entree next to the one wine recommendation was the price of the entree and glass of wine. The total bill came out to $25 + $35 for ONE glass of wine. I felt that this was very MISLEADING and dishonest and for this reason I will not return. It was clear when I asked the waiter for clarification from his tone and response that this was not the first time this has happened and that it was meant to be intentionally misleading. They do not clarify for you."}
{"text":"1 star for great food; 1 star for great atmosphere 3 stars down for the severe lack of education in the service staff.   I made a reservation or \"request\" for 4 people @ 4:30pm for the following day to be seated on the rooftop patio. Simple.   A \"coordinator\" calls me in the morning on the day of our \"request\" to confirm we have a table for 2 in the main floor patio. I said no...4 people....rooftop. She keeps saying that its not possible that the first girl booked this incorrectly. I'm a banker, my line is recorded. I will bring up the proof! Another girl comes on the phone, I re-explain and she confirms.   At 4:00pm I called the restaurant as I was going to be about 10 minutes late, but to hold my table on the rooftop. Clueless #3 on the phone tells me that my request is only for 2 people on the rooftop patio. How difficult is this?? ...4 people...rooftop...   Well at this point she says theres nothing she can do and we can squeeze in the table for 2. Clueless #3 also tells me that when I arrive, that I should tell the manager my situation (even though it was Clueless #1-3 f-up) and that the best they can do is place me in the waitlist. I did speak with a manager (I think she was at least, she was the only one with a higher than 6th grade education clearly) and we were eventually sat on the rooftop.  We order drinks. Easy. The drinks in the picture. I even pointed directly at the picture. Our server, Clueless #4 comes back with some other drinks. We said they were not what we ordered, the manager comes around and asks why we had sent back the drinks we ordered. Somebody clearly lied.  I mean don't get me wrong Cactus, I really enjoy the vibe and the food on the previous occasions I had been there with my colleagues. I have nothing against service staff, having been one myself for 4 years so I can justly say, that my experience here that day was beyond frustrating. I felt like my IQ dropped about 20 points after leaving this restaurant. They need help..."}
{"text":"Omg the best food ever! The salmon salad with grilled avacado was to die for! Shall be back again tomorrow."}
{"text":"I've heard this place be called a \"banker bar\" which I guess makes sense considering the location in the financial district and is actually cool by me considering that's what I do. I've been a few times for dinner and a few more for drinks and while I do think it's s little overpriced, everything has generally been really good. I really like the sablefish (I'm a huge sucker for black cod and they do it well) and the kale salad. They have a nice cocktail menu as well with all of the classics and a few unique options."}
{"text":"I don't trust them...but I like them.  Highly suspect.   I'm oddly highly suspicious of the Cactus Club. I've been a few times and I always walk in very slowly and cautiously while squinting one eye.    They do all of the things that should in fact make you question what you are doing here. Enter; Unnecessarily short skirts and even higher heels. Enter; All female staff except the management. Enter; Terribly generic over played satellite music. Enter; Dark tacky rooms and in this particular CCC, a bar surrounded by glass. Like being at an aquarium...only in the dark...and lots of drunks and sports inside. And no whales. Well...depends on who you ask I suppose.   They also don't seem to practice any recycling or compost programs in Calgary. Another big box habit.  They pride themselves in being one of the only multi-unit certified \"green restaurant concepts\" in BC, but unfortunately not in Calgary.   Despite all of these typical nightmare-Moxies-like cliche's, the service is 1000x's better and the food you're expecting to be just as lacking in personality...isn't in the slightest.  They make an awesome Korean Style Lettuce Wrap.    The Korean Style Lettuce Wraps are delicious!  A platter of braised and shredded pork shoulder,  kimchi, chopped ginger and green onion, korean chili bean sauce and spicy yogurt served with a side wedge of ice berg lettuce.   Of the 3 or 4 times that I've stopped in (cautiously of course) I've always ordered this and I always love it.  I wish I could review some more dishes, but I actually can't not order these lettuce wraps and I will again.   I'm watching you CCC. With one squinty eye."}
{"text":"A very trendy spot and usually always packed. I've been here a few times with friends for drinks. I love the inside decor and music. Although a bit loud at times! The service is good as well as I've never had a bad experience. They have three different levels and it can be long waiting lines if you don't have reservations.   Usually I order the truffle fries, a must have! It's extremely delicious and after 11pm it's half off. I love the desserts here as well. The burger is ok nothing special.   Ofcourse I would come back and would recommend this to everyone. A place to hang out after work or to bring a date if you don't mind the noise. I just wish they had a dance floor!"}
{"text":"Had the modern bowl and it was a bit sweet for my liking but the cocktails are great. Cool place, trendy vibe. Service was good with our waitress but the hostess service could have been a bit more friendly."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, and well perfectly made appetizer calamari; balance breaded with jalapenos peppers and deep fried to golden crispy. No wonder why this location was busy during Thursday evening. Kudos to all Cactus team members."}
{"text":"I never ate here but i go for my specialty cocktail : the Brazilian!!! Out of this world~~Cloud Quality Time~   The Brazilian, is a sweet cocktail with kiwi, sugar cane, soda and lime with a tad of White rum. Its so good that you will keep ordering it consistently, and you will be tipsy without knowing how quickly you got there. if they can create a Jug of this I will order it all for MYSELF!  Its a very busy spot, so you either have reservations or be willing to wait for a minimum of 1.5 hours especially on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.  I have only been on the 2nd and 3rd floor, their 2nd floor is more of a bar , 3rd floor is your lounge area with a DJ even on Sundays. Great music and great vibe, but sometimes its hard to get the attention of their staff and hard to hear your friends. Seating is very limited as well."}
{"text":"Great spot downtown for business lunch.  Make reservations well in advance (a week!) Or try your luck as a walk in for lunch.   I had the Brazilian which was delicious.  Burgers are pretty good too.   Has an excellent atmosphere especially on the rooftop patio with retractable cover.  Staff are friendly and we'll trained.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"A frequent lunch hangout.  Busy during the lunch rush, but always ready with cheery and efficient staff.  The menu has great fresh items to choose from for anybody's tastes and drink specials seem to be offered daily.  Even if you've only got an hour for lunch you can usually get in and out within that time without feeling rushed.  My most recent visit placed us with an extremely cheerful, friendly and attentive waitress -  even in your most miserable mood, she'd have you feeling pretty damn happy when you finished your meal.  It was that contagious."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I planned a trip to Toronto and the cactus club was on our \"must do\" list. We heard the tuna stack was amazing and the atmosphere  was fun. The tuna stack was amazing, fresh and light. The hour long wait for a table, not so great .. especially when their website states it's not necessary to make a reservation. About 2 hours in we finally got our meals .. the ravioli was delicious. I ordered the short rib and everything on my plate was cold otherwise it may have been good. Three hours in and we finally were able to get our bill and my feet and fingers were so swollen from the salt in my meal I couldn't wait to get home."}
{"text":"More like 3.5 to be accurate.   Cactus Club is always happening whether it's the rooftop patio, the second floor bar or the dining room, at times its hard to even get a seat without a hefty wait.  I do enjoy the cocktails for the most part (a handful are overly sugary). I find the food choices to be minimal, at least to my eating preferences. I would love to see more dining options. In the past the food has been on the salty side (I know I complain about salt way too much on Yelp!), and at times the apps don't seem to have a lot of value.  The drink and ambiance are what draw me in.  There's always a crowd, always great for people watching, for the most part other patrons are friendly and in the chill/party vibe (depending on which level you are in the resto) and the drinks are cheap in comparison to other local watering holes.  It's a great after work spot for after work drinks, or a Friday/Saturday dinner and party type of night."}
{"text":"They told me the wait was 30-45min. We waited 1hr and 10min! I was FULLY prepared to write a disappointed review thinking this place would be over hyped, but I was dead wrong!   Aside from the wait I couldn't have been more blown away! Despite being such a new restaurant, their service and food was on point. Beautiful decor and ambiance, exceptional service (even though our server Asley was still in training) and the food was nothing short of impeccable. For the experience, portion size and quality of food, it was well worth it.   We polished off every single plate despite claiming that we weren't hungry and only came for drinks and to snack on apps!   Here are the MUST orders: beef carpaccio app and the butternut squash ravioli main. These two dishes were the BEST I've ever had anywhere! TO DIE FOR!!!"}
{"text":"Staying near the Calgary Airport this location is a the perfect spot to enjoy dinner, watch games or even get work done while you eat amongst beautiful waitresses and host staff (free wifi works well). This location succeeds at everything: great food, good service and awesome atmosphere.   We tried the tuna appetizer and for the price they give you an enormous amount of tuna, not mention the sauce it's in is awesome! Also had a starter seasonal greens, which could have been half a meal. The spring mix, dressing and cheese crumbles complimented each other well.   My friend ordered the creole steak and prawns and raved about it. I went with the blackened creole chicken. The veggies, mashed potatoes and chicken were cooked well. It'd be a challenge to find something on the menu that wasn't good."}
{"text":"Went in for a birthday dinner. The music, lighting makes for a nice ambiance. Service was good. I had the fish taco which was good. I wasn't blown away by the menu options."}
{"text":"I feel 'Meh' about Cactus Club. Don't get me wrong, the food is delicious but the place itself is super pretentious. Staff was nice but they're inexperienced and their clothes are way too tight... How do they work long shifts with extra high heels?!   I visited with a bunch of co-workers and as designers, the space was over designed. The feature light fixtures alone were screaming... Look At Me!!! But there was a different one right beside another. I digress. The food is definitely tasty. All my dining mates enjoyed their meals. I had the braised beef parpadelle with porcini sauce and it was Outstanding.   Our partner paid for the meals and it was more than likely very expensive. I would totally come back for the braised beef... But only if it's on someone else's tab ;)"}
{"text":"My wife and I just had supper here and it was fabulous. We had the Short Rib Sandwich and the Louisiana Rice Bowl. Both were excellent. Service was excellent as well. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I have been waiting for this location to open for almost 1.5 years now if not more.  This is my favourite chain restaurant from the west cost, without fail, every trip to Vancouver consists of a visit to cactus club.  the ambience is amazing here, perfectly dimmed lights where you don't feel too tired or overly cozy where you want to sleep.  The service was good, she came to check up on us just enough, polite, answered questions and made recommendations.  We waited over an hour to get a table, lounged on the deck until we were seated. The deck seems like it turns into a lounge afterward, the music was great just a little crowded. we opted to eat on the main floor in the dining room.  I had the appetizer sized ravioli, my friends had the baja tacos and another friend had the lettuce wrap and lastly the quinoa salad. I enjoyed my servicing, one of my friends like her tacos the other didn't. The serving sizes were perfect, we didn't have any food left over.   I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The food was great! The cheeseburger with bacon was one of the biggest ones I've seen out there. There was a lot of flavour in the burger.   We weren't very happy with where we were seated. We made a reservation for 8 and they gave us a booth that could only fit 6 people comfortably. Otherwise, the service was great."}
{"text":"Not sure where to start...service was on point, food was delish (I had the blackened Cajun chicken and it was AMAZING!), and the atmosphere was relaxed yet trendy. We came for lunch and will leave full and satisfied!"}
{"text":"Can't think of a single thing wrong! Fabulous! The wait was close to 20 mins, but it was also happy hour, so not surprising! Best peach Bellini I have had. The service was outstanding! In this day and age that is hard to come by! The young manager was in a suit jacket, and it was so nice to see our waitress was a pleasure, and unfortunately I didn't get her name, but they all were great. All the food was good, and a great selection! We will be back"}
{"text":"Called to make a reservation for lunch at noon for 2 people-6 days in advance and she said they were full (I call BS on that one).  This is not the first time this has happened with the Cactus Club on Stephen Ave.  They refuse to take reservations for a table of 2 and they always feed you the same line.... \"we keep a large portion of our restaurant open for walk-ins\", I've tried this at lunch time with them , it's impossible to get a table at that time as a walk-in, unless you get there at 11:15.    I can't stand it when restaurants refuse to book reservations for smaller parties."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, atmosphere and staff. I visit on a weekly basis and am always satisfied."}
{"text":"Great service, but pass on the wonton soup....otherwise, good menu selection."}
{"text":"A trendy place located in the heart of the Financial District of Toronto at First Canadian Place. The indoor entrance is located at the First Canadian Place food court and it is conveniently connected along with the path. The design and menu made me think of Joey's for some reason.  I came here with a big group as we sat up on the deck level which is the rooftop patio level. In the summer time, it must be nice with the roof open. However, during the winter season, it is covered up but not fully sealed so you can feel a cold draft at times. They have heaters on the ceilings but if you sit right below them, it can be very, very hot. We got to sit in one of the booths but I thought that a booth is a bit too small for a group of 7 people.  I ordered the cajun chicken sandwich with fries. The food came out promptly and it is a great sandwich. It did not look filling at first but as I kept taking more and more bites, I am definitely wrong. The chicken is grilled and not fried which is great. The sandwich was topped off with age cheddar. The fries were also good.   Overall, not a bad place to eat."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. I had the dry rubbed ribs and they were very good! A hot bowl of the won ton soup rounded out my visit and I enjoyed it very much. As seems to be the custom in Calgary restaurants, the lady servers were very appealing to the eye."}
{"text":"Normally I really enjoy going to the cactus club. But this time I was disappointed by the service and quality of food.  We are visiting Calgary yesterday and decided to go there last night.  We ordered the beef carpaccio to start, JD ribs, and chocolate lava cake.  Don't get me wrong our waitress was very nice (her name was Nicola) But when our food came, she brought the appetizer and main at the same time. To start the ribs were not too warm as is so by the time we finished our appie and got to the main it was already very cold, the sauce a little bitter as well. Maybe too much JD?? I don't know.  Also the crostini was a little burnt so it had a burnt/bitter taste to it.  I told the waitress about it but she didn't seem to care too much.  Then we had the lava cake for dessert, (I wanted my usual which was the apple galette which they took off the menu. . ) Now  wouldn't call It lava cake because it did not even flow out when we cut the cake. It had a pudding consistency to it. It was at least warm but still disappointing. Joeys lava cake still hands down the best! I guess I was comparing it to that standard."}
{"text":"Fun place if your single or into people watching; otherwise it doesn't really have too much else to offer, average food and standard drink selection."}
{"text":"Tried to make a reservation for 15 ppl and they said they only allow reservations for up to 10. And it has to be early (before 630pm). I guess they don't want big groups of people coming and spending hundreds of dollars? Okay then."}
{"text":"Great ambience and service. The tuna stack was great! The steak was so-so and the shrimp didn't taste like it was very fresh. The cocktails are really good too! Great place for a group party."}
{"text":"Haven't eaten much here but am obsessed with happy hour bellinis! Doesn't get much better. Perfect place to start bar hopping on Stephen ave!"}
{"text":"I recently made a stop over at The Cactus Club and I was shocked that I hadn't discovered it sooner!  What a cool place!  The servers are great, the atmosphere is great, the crowd is great and the food is great!  I ordered the Spinach & Artichoke Quesadilla along with a Strawberry milkshake. Can I just say that the milkshake was one of the BEST milkshakes I've ever had?!?!? They even did it the old-school way where they brought the 'extra' milkshake in the metal mixer cup over, along with the glass. DELICIOUS.  If you're planning on heading over on the weekend, I'd suggest making a reservation however. It beats having to wait at the door.  I was very impressed with The Cactus Club and plan on heading back in the very near future."}
{"text":"Exceeded my expectations -- I was expecting more of the same in the financial district but Cactus Club really transcends its peers as it relates to the food! The butternut squash ravioli and short rib were packed with flavor and executed to perfection."}
{"text":"Billy, our server was a dream (boat) haha. Very attentive, asked for our names and addressed us with our names. Loved it. He was so attentive he even asked if the temperature of my water was to my liking (I had asked for loads of ice). Wish all men were as attentive as this wonderful soul. He asked if our table of 10 was celebrating anything special (we weren't - just a girls night out to watch Kinky boots). He was super friendly and told us he loved the show. With hair like his, I would believe anything he said as he was perfect. Ok, I think you guys get the point. Servers/service is incredible here. Except one gentleman who brought out our food - saw him whisper something snarky to another lady server when I had wondered why they were a bit confused about which one of us ordered what dish (most restaurants know your order by the way you are seated - most of us ordered the same thing so it got a bit confusing but none of us were mad about it. I just said out loud that \"oh don't they usually know who ordered what by our seats\". Anyways, that didn't ruin my evening cause ... well cause Billy's exceptional service was all I could think of (insert heart eyed emoji).  I ordered the greenforest salad with salmon, yam fries and fish taco - yes I ate it all. Everything was to die for. The salad had the perfect amount of dressing! My salmon addition was just an added $1-$2 as I replaced the chicken with salmon. At Joey's they usually charge me for the chicken AND the salmon despite it being  substitution and not actually getting the chicken. But this ain't joeys and praise the lord for that. The yam fries comes with a dip that I could have licked dry. So so yummy. My fish taco was good but not my favorite and likely wouldn't order that again.   Price is what you would expect from an establishment in the financial center. $60 for my meal above. Decor is nice nothing to write home about. Everyone kept saying to me \"Oh Catus is so fancy\" but not sure why. I did not find it 'fancy' as such - not to say it wasn't nice. Everyone made it sound like some upscale 5 star hotel. Haven't been on the patio yet.   Reservation was a bit of a pain according to my friend who did it for us. Definitely advisable to book ahead. She had to go through email correspondence with a reservation \"consultant\" which took place in segments of 24 hr wait periods over a total or 2-3 days.   Ok, back to Billy! Near the end he asked us what time our show was and if we were good for time. How wonderful is this server? He did he best to make sure our food got out on time as some of my friends joined us late. He also came around with 3 credit card machines to make sure we all paid quickly and efficiently in order to make it in time for our 8 pm show. I would come back over and over if servers like Billy are the standard here. Excellent first experience! Great food, great place and excellent service!"}
{"text":"Love this place it's awesome. Favourite two dishes Szechuan Chicken Lettuce Wraps and Sanlefish!!!"}
{"text":"This is like any other place like moxie or earls. Their Creole steak was awesome....Atmosphere is great, cozy and loud. I suggest this place to pilots i deal with on a daily bases."}
{"text":"Came here with a bunch of friends for a nice birthday dinner. The food was good - however the experience as a whole was overrated. We spent quite a bit on fare and drinks for dinner and had a great time. Our hostess said we could go up to the rooftop after our dinner - no problem. She did warn us it's standing space only, and we were okay with that. After we paid our bills and headed up to the patio, the bouncer there flat out denied us. Horrible experience if you ask me. We explained to them that our hostess said we could go up, but they refused us and was quite rude about it. After spending $1000+ at our table, we expected more courtesy.   Oh, we had to send one of our steaks back because the cook was way off.   Overpriced. Overrated."}
{"text":"The Cactus Club has an excellent menu and very friendly service. Our waitress, Salmon was knowledgable about the menu and was quick to offer very accurate and positive review of her favorite choices on the menu. We will definitely be coming here next time we're in Calgary!"}
{"text":"Favorite place to eat in Toronto. I had never seen a restaurant stretch three floor before so it was pretty cool seeing an elevator inside a restaurant.  The service is great even when the place gets busy and servers are spread thin. They slightly messed up my wife's order so they had to remake hers. They offered to make my meal over again as well or keep it heated until hers got made.  The food here was very good and we enjoyed all of the meals we had to the fullest. They have a huge selection of foods and drinks so they'll always have something you're looking for.  We will be coming here again for sure next time we come to Toronto."}
{"text":"Seriously impressed!  The food, the atmosphere, and the service were all top notch!   Try to make a reservation if you can - the place was packed.  My husband made a reso and we got a nice booth at the back.  L We got the tuna stack to start (so fresh and delicious - a must try).  My husband was a bit disappointed that there wasn't a ribeye on the menu but he went with the 12oz striploin with four mushroom topper and absolutely loved it.   It was cooked perfectly and the mashed potato/asparagus accompaniment were delicious.  I got the ravioli entree - also yummy, shrimp were big and juicy, and it was very filling.  It could have used a bit more truffle flavor.    We finished with the chocolate lava cake - yum!   Next time we will try the beef carpaccio - almost everyone sitting around us ordered it."}
{"text":"I like the Cactus Clubs in Vancouver but this one on Macleod Trail has disappointed me a few times in the areas of service and food quality. Price-points esp. on cocktail specials like their watermelon margaritas are great but I'd rather pay more for consistently good service and food.  Service: Friendly, but incredibly slow and disorganized. We waited a long time for a patio table on a lazy Sunday afternoon and waited even longer (nearly 15 minutes) for a waitress to show up with menus. No one offered us water. You could tell that our beers were sitting on the bar for awhile as there was a significant amount of condensation in the glass. When we did ask for water, we only got one glass.  Another table next to us who was sat 10 minutes after our arrival were clearly friends of the manager as they had fast service, water-without-asking and about 3 different servers helping them out.  I'll visit Cactus Club in Van City only..."}
{"text":"Walked in on a Tuesday morning around 11:40 am to get a table of two and we were seated on the upstairs deck under the sun.   I ordered the classic dish that everyone I know has recommended/raved about: Butternut squash ravioli with prawns. The combination to me seemed a bit weird with the prawns and the squash mixture. However, after trying it, I quite enjoyed it and did not mind the prawns at all. Overall, the dish was very filling and super rich for a lunch plate.   I'm interested in trying their dinner menu in the future as well.   Great spot to catch up with some friends or hang out with colleagues after work."}
{"text":"Just because it's a chain does not mean we should go bashing a restaurant, or enter with the preconceived notion that it will be ordinary, or unimaginative or average.  Cactus Club Cafe is actually none of those things. Their menu is expansive, imaginative, and the food is expertly prepared. The service has been great both times I have been there.  I have tried their double braised pineapple hoisin short rib, and it was delicious. The meat was braised very well.. soft and tender. And the pineapple / korean chili sauce was a great match. It came with a heaping side of mashed potatoes.   Their wine list is actually quite good also. They have the regular ones like Mission Hill and Kim Crawford (neither of them are ones I would order), and they also have some unique ones like 'Feenie goes haywire' and Masi Amarone, etc. I noticed several on there that I want to try on future visits.  Cactus Club is a great place for dates, small groups etc if you're near Chinook! It is    Review #26 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012"}
{"text":"If I could I'd eat here all the time !!!    Food, music and drinks are all five stars for me !!!  Biggest complaint, not enough seating in the summer times !!   I love their lobster ravioli, it's light, flavourful and just right portion. Available in appy and dinner size. Calamari, another great app. Light and very crispy. They drinks are well made and kinda pricy.  Tuna stack another delicious and fresh item.    When I go I like the first floor out on the patio or the top floor. If the weather nice the sunroof opens up.  This place is a DJ on two floors I believe. They music is always great and turns the place into a party.   Ps: another location is opening up at Sherway soon."}
{"text":"Took me a while to write this review as I kept going back and forth between 3 and 4 stars.  But, a 4 star restaurant for me is one I definitely want to go back to - if I never went back to Cactus Club, that would be okay.  This whole place really puts the \"club\" in \"club cafe\".   They really need an email address or online booking system but I feel like they screen you from the moment you want to dine there.  The front hostess desk is like a troll at a castle - I feel like even if you did have a reservation but they didn't like the look of you, they'd turn you away (a la Real Sports).  Service, however, was excellent; friendly and efficient.  That saved them for sure.  My martini was made correctly (hard to screw up but still).  The food was way overpriced and boring though; I know that chains are trying to appeal to many palates but I also know chains like the Keg do simple food (like steak or calamari) well.  Everything was oversalted and just boring.  The fries were awful.  Three stars for good service, really awesome bathrooms (where the door swings outwards from the stall, instead of boxing you into the toilet!), and a busy, loud, bustling ambiance that makes you feel a part of it all (in this case, watching the Jays stink it all up)."}
{"text":"It was okay. To be sincere we had to make a line over an hour and a half. We ordered sangrias that are 11 dollars, weren't bad but you get 3/4 ice and the rest actual drink. I had to tell them NOT to put ice in my sangria to get the actual worth of my drink. We ordered two appetizers which we're delicious; truffle fries and fried calamari. We had 5 sangrias and two entries. Bill came out over 100+ dollars. To be honest, the price + the incredible wait time isn't worth, at least for me. NOTE: Normally really crowded."}
{"text":"There's something special about the Cactus Club.  I don't know what it is, but I really enjoy eating there (really doesn't matter which Cactus Club I go to).    My bf and I ordered the calamari to start.  Their calamari got to be one of my faves!  Honestly, the amount of calamari they gave us was enough to fill me up.  I was pretty full from it before my main course.  It comes with jalapenos and red peppers!  Just LOVE!    I ordered the Rob's Hunter Chicken.  The chicken was very tendered (however, to me the flavor is a little bit on the heavier side).  But that's just me, I love steamed veggies with no salt, no seasoning (so that gives you an idea how sensitive my taste buds are).  Unfortunately, the dish my bf ordered was disappointing.  He ordered the scallops shrimp spaghetti.  It was just too salty.  He literally had two bites and he had no choice but to send it back.  The manager was very apologetic.    Other than that, I still think Cactus Club is a nice place to enjoy your evening whether it is with your other half or with your friends and family."}
{"text":"Sensational is an understatement, as the many times I've happened to walk by this place I never decided to wine and dine here but boy was that regretful. My lady and I decided to enjoy a Saturday evening out here at Cactus Club Cafe and enjoyment was more than satisfied.   Our only regret of the night was not making reservations lol. Who were we kidding expecting to just walk in and be seated on a Saturday night in downtown Toronto. It was about a 30 minute wait as we went to the bar to grab a few drinks.   Order: We ordered Truffle fries to start which were incredible and the portion size was more than enough but hey we weren't complaining. The truffle fries itself were fantastic and the garlic aioli that accompanied it was delicious.   *Our mains* were the Baja Fish Tacos and Butternut Squash Ravioli with Prawns. I couldn't taste the butternut squash on account of being cursed with a seafood allergy but she seemed to enjoy it. The Baja Fish Tacos were amazing though, the fish itself was crispy and moist on the inside and the accompanying sauces that came with it were a delicious addition.   We normally dislike \"chain restaurants\" but I wouldn't even put Cactus Club Cafe under that same level. It's safe to say that we will be back very soon to try more items on the menu. 5 stars all day!"}
{"text":"There is absolutely no reason why i should have to wait 150 minutes for a table that we previously reserved on a FREAKING THURSDAY night. This is absolutely ridiculous. The hostesses are very snooty and aloof. Won't be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Good place to have drinks and dinner after work. Service is good though they get a little busy on Friday night.  I recommend some of the mixed drinks they have during the happy hour. I'd come back"}
{"text":"Server knowledge: 4 Server attitude: 4 Fast service: 4 Food Menu: 4 Drinks Menu: 4 Food quality: 4.5 Food Portion: 4.5 Ambience: 4.5 Distance to other tables: 5 Cleanliness: 4.5 Waiting time to get seated: 3.5 Price: 4  Had to wait 15min to get seated, other than that, very good place to eat!"}
{"text":"Came by last night and was told it was an hour wait for a table. Ok fine. Sat at the bar and had a drink. 2 hours later the first floor was full of open tables.   I went to the front hostess area and she told me they tried to buzz us, they give u a pager, which wasn't true because i had that pager in front of me the whole time and I was watching it like a hawk   I said there are many free tables right in front of us, she said they're closing down the first floor area and can't seat us there. At this point we are going into the 2.5 hour wait range.   I think she felt sorry for us and sat us in one of those open tables.   Steak was too meaty, yam fries were good, service was very poor.  *Ok so clarification about the comment about the steak was too 'meaty'  So I feel like the taste was meaty. There was no spice. Other steaks I've had, Jacobs, the keg, or at home, have all had flavour. It's my preference for my steak to have some flavour and not a meaty taste.  To each their own! *"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite restaurants in the financial district. As a hospitality professional myself I often recommend it to hotel guests. It's casual yet classy atmosphere is perfect for any occasion and the menu had an excellent selection of items. Think Joeys but waaaaaay nicer and better in every possibly measurement.   My most recent visit was delicious as always! The service is always very consistent here -  I've never had a bad experience but our server ONeil went above and beyond to make sure we were extremely well taken care of. I have a strict dietary restriction and he made me feel absolutely confident I wouldn't be consuming anything I can't (because medical reasons) Some of my favourite items are:   -lettuce wraps  -fried chicken sandwich  - prawn ravioli pasta   They also run a great cocktail program with daily specials. I tried out different cocktails and all were made extremely well by the bartenders with good consistency.   You can't go wrong with Cactus!"}
{"text":"Rooftop has a great vibe, music was phenomenal, food was yummy and whoever makes the Moscow Mules is amazing! I had the fish tacos, my husband had the garden burger.  Both were excellent!! (Delicious fries!) Service was great as well, will definitely be returning next time we're in town!!"}
{"text":"Toronto's new downtown hot spot opened tonight and I had been anxiously awaiting the opening, since I first saw it was coming and after going to the one in Vancouver a couple of times. Its right at the base of First Canadian Place, Adelaide St side, with entrances off Adelaide and inside, from the 2nd level food court area.   There are 3 levels, ground floor (Kate's Bar), 2nd level is the Rob Feenie (iron chef) dining room and lounge After eating, we went exploring, to check out the rooftop aka \"The Deck\", with a fully retractable roof and it was happening!  Being in the financial district, not surprisingly the crowd was mainly after work types. The ladies at the door were as friendly as they were lovely and despite how busy it was when we arrived around 6:30 pm, its a big place and we were shown to a table right away.   Low light setting throughout, with not too loud background music in the dining area, louder of course in the lounge and the rooftop is more on the \"loungey\" side.  Although the beer list is not extensive, they have 1/2 dozen signature ones and some of the well known \"safe\" ones, Heineken (which I got), Coors Light, Guinness, Corona  The mixed drinks on the other hands, they have quite a few \"ini's, Martini's and Bellini's!!  I'm not a huge wine drinker but saw they have a good selection of white and red.  We jumped right into the main course (both good sized portion rice bowls and delicious , Jambalaya which had a bit of a kick and the teriyaki chicken. The only reason, we didn't get a starter is because we were too busy catching up. Looking back, I would've liked to have tried a few different ones, such as butternut squash soup with scallops or the flat bread.  For dessert we had the caramel chocolate mousse, which you could get a single, double or triple. Each of the 3 was in a small cup, so its perfect if you want to end off your meal with a touch of sweetness.  Price range could be $$ - $$$ depending what you get, our bill for 2 came to $67, which included the 2 mains, 2 beers and 1 dessert.  Can't wait to go back and try some more things!"}
{"text":"This new social club restaurant is located by first Canadian place. Style is pretty much in direct competition with its Neighbour restaurant, Reds.   It is difficult to get a seat because it is now supposedly the hottest and most popular restaurant in Toronto. Advice: reserve early. The place is pretty compact and has two floors (unless there is a third floor that I didn't see). The second floor features a massive bar in the middle and at the sides are booth tables. At night, there is a live DJ that plays music throughout.  The food are all at the high end spectrum. Although the name is cactus club, the food is by no means mexican.  Aside from taco and ceviche, none of the food are Mexican. If you want authentic Mexican food, you came to the wrong place.   I ordered ceviche as starters and short braised beef as entree. The ceviche is not authentic at all as I expect some raw fish with totopo. Instead, the fish was well cooked. For my main dish, the quality is good as beef is tender. However, the portion isn't big. Don't expect to be full after dinner at Cactus Club. This restaurant is meant to social, fun, talking about business or even for a date."}
{"text":"The food is always great and delivered in a timely manner. The rooftop patio is a blast on Thursday nights in the summers. Management always professional, taking the time to come talk to patrons about their experience and building rapport, though they should talk to servers about eye-rolling when someone gives them a warning about an allergy. Indeed, the girls can be a bit snarky, as twenty-something women often are to other twenty-something women. Oddly the attitude seems to disappear if I am there with my boyfriend and/or male colleagues ;)"}
{"text":"I like this place.  The salmon had excellent flavor, perfectly cooked atop a small bed of barley  and mushrooms, surrounded in the Dijon sauce. The drawback was the amount of salt the kitchen used was close to overwhelming. The same for the lingcod w curry and rice, this time it was the fish that took a double barreled blast from the salt gun. Lighten it up a bit, chef.  Good salad side w spinach, mixed greens, and (a boatload) of almonds! Mix in some feta / dressed in primarily oil it needed some brightness from vinegar or a lemon.   Loved the yam fries w garlic aioli. Sure they could've been the ones you get at the supermarket, it was the sauce that was the star of that app.  Good local wheat beer and a kick-ass Bellini (if that is possible). Friendly and accommodating staff whipped up a bowl of mixed berries for the boy."}
{"text":"This is definetly one of the best eating experiences that I've ever had in Toronto. The food was so good (absolutely divine!) that I'm still thinking about it months later. Suffice to say, I know that I'll be back there again. I went to Cactus Club back in July and I ordered the tuna stack, the truffle fries, and a glass of froze. The drink blew my mind (unfortunately it's a seasonal drink and I'll have to wait till next summer to enjoy it), the fries and dipping sauce brought me to life, and the tuna stack gave me life. I plan to eat my way through the menu over time. The service is efficient and moderate in speed, and it's definetly worth making your regular spot if you happen to live in the neighborhood. And if you don't live in the neighbourhood, I promise you that it's worth the trek."}
{"text":"This place is super hip, like eating at a club. A bit pricey too. A police officer, who we met while walking nearby, recommended it to us for dinner.   I had Rob's flatbread because I wasn't very hungry. It was delicious!  Like a super yummy salad on flatbread. It wasn't too filling and really hit the spot.   I think I would have loved it here on a night out. Too bad I only had one night in Toronto and was on a work trip."}
{"text":"I have been going to Cactus Club biweekly since they've opened both with my boyfriend and work colleagues. I've organized multiple group reservations, and have constantly recommended this establishment for it's great food, atmosphere and service.  Last night, upon my recommendation, my friend had her birthday dinner here. The two gentlemen at the door, both with very large beards, denied my boyfriend because he was wearing black and red Jordan running shoes.  After speaking with a manager, he made it clear that dress code was in full effect and unfortunately there wasn't anything he could do. My boyfriend went home to change and I confirmed with one of the gentlemen in the front, wearing a grey suit and large beard, that if he changed he would be allowed in. I noticed 2 other males also wearing Jordan running shoes in line to go in and pointed this out to the gentlemen. He said that they would not be allowed up to the deck. Now here's where I'm completely frustrated and disappointed in Cactus Club. I go upstairs to the deck to see the same 2 males in Jordan running shoes, another male in Nike Roches and then a few minutes later a male with bright red running shoes come in. Dress code is fully enforced?! I spoke with another manager and pointed out all the individuals that had similar shoes to my boyfriend. Nothing was done. It was clear that those gentlemen in the front let in who they wanted, not enforcing the dress code at their discretion.  If you are going to employ those two gentlemen who seemingly exercise their power and use your rules to discriminate against people, then unfortunately I can no longer support this establishment."}
{"text":"I come here often. Food is consistent, good service and it's always busy. I really like their happy hour after 9pm, fish tacos, truffle fries, sliders, etc."}
{"text":"We were very disappointed in the sirloin cut. Two people in my party got the sirloin and the meat was very tough and some pieces you couldn't chew at all. Go to MOXIES restaurant....we got the same cut, same price and it was SO MUCH BETTER."}
{"text":"Great location, romantic ambiance and service was excellent and prompt. I had the Bandara salad and it was delicious, fresh and probably the best salad I have ever had in a restaurant. Nice wine selection. Good idea to make a reservation, esp on the weekend."}
{"text":"I am solely giving the three stars because I love the food and think it's pretty good for a chain restaurant.   They could however change it up sometimes but still their classic items are always delicious and unique. Try the Squash Ravioli with the crunchy sage leaf atop the ravioli s and also Robs Chicken Sandwhich! The sandwhich has just the right mix of everything down to the veggies.   Their belinis are also very sweet and yummy. Only have one though cause half way through you'll be falling over ! Lolol  The service however, that is the biggest thing they've gotta work on. I may not be a business man in a 3 piece suit ( just a foodie girl in forever 21 clothes) but it isn't nice to be selective to those you assume with big tipping options. The waitresses do need to fairly be attentive to everybody not just their staff friends to gossip about other tables. That is in bad taste for everyone eating !   I will update my review soon as patio season rolls around"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on Sunday night. The place was packed. Good thing I made reservations. We had a group of 3 people and ordered 2 appetizers and 3 mains. Calamari was perfectly coated with a light batter and just cooked. Not chewy at all. The chicken lettuce wraps is good too. Just a tad salty. Hunter chicken and braised short ribs are delicious. Mash potatoes that came with the short ribs was loaded with butter and so creamy. The place was dimly lit and r&b was playing all night. Service from one of the waitresses was attentive and polite. The other waitress needs to improve her attitude. You can tell she doesn't like her job by her tone of voice when she spoke. So I would really rate this place 3.5 out of 5."}
{"text":"Cactus Club has evolved over the years to a mature and genuine business.  The Stephen Avenue Cactus Club is clean and always professional.  I like how all the staff at the downtown location are well dressed, offer great service and serve up well presented food.  From afternoon lunch faire to evening cocktails, out of all the Cactus Clubs, this is my favorite. I had to give a four star instead of five because I've encountered some small cleanliness challenges but all easy to remedy."}
{"text":"Took a risk and did a walk in without reservations on a Saturday.  We got lucky and was able to get a table right away, but then again, it was only 5:30pm..  Food was average.  Had the fish tacos and it was nothing too exciting.  The fish was light and crispy, but the aoili they served it with overpowered the fish.   Service was good.  The server was attentive and quick.  We told her we needed to be out by a certain time and she made sure that happened.  To end, good service and average food."}
{"text":"This is definitely the hip, young, happening place to be and I definitely wouldn't recommend it for tourists or if you're over the age of 35.   We were visiting from out of town and were met at the door by some strange non talkative bouncers who didn't welcome us at all. Maybe they thought they could discourage us from entering. The air in this place is just straight up bougie and the waitresses really focused all their time on the younger patrons. It was VERY loud and the music was even louder.   Our waitress came over three times the entire night. The restaurant was packed and there were three managers basically running the section of restaurant we were seated in because the waitresses couldn't keep it. Honestly, it seemed like a giant clusterf**k.   The food was mediocre but I think people come here more for the drinks. I had a great whiskey sour while my papparadelle was meh. Wouldn't come back or recommend unless you're 21 and like noisy crowds and poor service."}
{"text":"Incredible food, amazing service once inside the restaurant and past the door. They make it almost impossible to get a seat, it can be frustrating sometimes!!"}
{"text":"I'd go back! Ordered the chicken lettuce wraps as an appetizer, very tasty. Lots of flavor, two sauce options and filled with peanuts, scallions, crispy and cilantro.   Loved the squash ravioli that's topped with shrimp. Different and flavorful."}
{"text":"I came here expecting better food than all the other chain restaurants, but it was quite disappointing. The Bellini I ordered was delicious. It stayed frozen and didn't melt quickly like most others and the amount of alcohol to slush ratio was perfect. I ordered the steak frites and my husband ordered the filet mignon and we shared the calamari. The calamari came as small rings which tasted like cheap frozen squid. It was fishy and too salty. The dipping sauces were great, but no amount of sauce could improve the taste of the calamari. My steak frites was pretty good. I asked for medium and it was cooked medium rare while my husband asked for medium rare and he got medium. They must have mixed it up. I was too hungry to even bother mentioning it. I substituted my fries for truffle fries and the first couple bites were good, but I couldn't taste the truffle flavour after a few fries. The salad that came with my plate was delicious. It was more on the citrusy side. My husband's steak was pretty good and the asparagus and mashed potatoes were bland. We shared the key lime pie at the end of the meal. It was yummyyyy minus the HUGE dollop of whipped cream on top. I would come here for drinks, but would go not expecting much of the food."}
{"text":"Great food and the definitely a place to people watch.  It's really loud and is a very yuppie / show-off type of place.  We had the branzino and the tuna burger.  Both were good.  Portions are big for the sandwiches and burgers, but the fish portion was a tad small.  If you're a guy, you won't be full.    We sat at the bar as there was a very long wait time for a table.  Our bartender was really attentive and my drink was never empty.  Would go back again."}
{"text":"Awesome ambience and staff. Good Food, Good Music, Good People. a Rooftop Patio, and amazing service. What more can you ask for! Shoutout to Brendon for the awesome above and beyond customer experience!"}
{"text":"their prawn ravioli was great. I liked the duck clubhouse and the tuna tart too."}
{"text":"Food is really good. The ravioli is delicious. Waitress are all really good looking. New Orleans / Cajon chicken is amazing."}
{"text":"Delicious butternut squash ravioli. I wouldn't change anything about it. Steak is also very tasty. The Brazilian cocktail was pretty good. The Fawlty tower cocktail is not bad but it taste a lot like grapefruit and I personally don't like this fruit. I didn't really read the ingredients properly before ordering it (my bad). Key lime pie is good for sharing because it's pretty big. It's good but I wouldn't order it again.  Ambiance, service and cleanliness is 10/10. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Visited Cactus Club and had a great experience! I only gave a 4 star due to it being so busy that our server was MIA for a little bit. Otherwise, the food and environment was amazing! My colleague and I went around 6 pm without a reservation so we did have to wait for about 20 minutes but it was worth it.   As an app, we had the garlic fries which were perfect for sharing and delicious. The aioli was sooo good alongside each bite.For main entrees, I had the short rib pappardelle which was very flavourful and hit the spot. My friend ordered the highly talked about butternut squash ravioli and she enjoyed it. She mentioned it was quite rich but delicious and the portion was a good size. For drinks, we tried the Flirtini and the Cohiba. Both were yummy!    Overall we had a great experience and we will be back in the near future!"}
{"text":"The space really is quite beautiful with each of its three floors offering a unique atmosphere. The first floor is very low key - the type of place where you might sip a few Pinot grigios with your girlfriends while avoiding the douche bags upstairs. The second floor is the most restaurant-like, where you'd go to grab some dinner. The third floor is where this place gets slightly night-clubish with men in suits on the prowl looking for their next catch. The odds are not great, however, given a girl:guy ratio highly in favour of women.   The third floor also boasts a retractable roof which will make it even more attractive in the warmer months. Drinks are priced at what you'd expect for this kind of place. I highly recommend the 'Cohiba' which is some vodka/gin concoction with muddled lemon, mint, blackberry, soda and simple syrup.   Haven't had much in the way of food besides the Cajun Chicken Sandwich which was better than most chicken sandwiches I've had.   Only downside for me is the unfriendly bartenders. In addition to never speaking to the guests, one of them actually argued with me about my bill which was clearly wrong.   Would I go back? Yes. But I could do with less attitude."}
{"text":"I've been here couple of times and like the variety of food options, location and the vibe of the restaurant. I had been to Cactus in Vancouver and the one in Toronto is even better.  I hosted few friends who were visiting Canada and they absolutely loved the place. I had Rob's Flatbread and Vegetarian Teriyaki Rice Bowl - both were well made. My friends tried other dishes and only had good things to say about food.  The only drawback is that the place gets full pretty fast and you always need reservations to be sure...   Ask for vegetarian menu!"}
{"text":"Hands down the most poppin place to have dinner & drinks!   We went to the Cactus club for my friends celebratory dinner.  She just graduated and obtained her Masters.   We decided to go to a fun place with great food right after.    The cactus club has such an amazing vibe.  Very modern feel and great music!  The music at this restaurant elevated my meal!  Haha!    While waiting for our table to be ready we were ushered in by Max.   He was so nice and immediately took us under his wing.  He offered us a complimentary drink on the house to celebrate my friend and bumped up our table.    We felt like queens because of Max!  Thank you so much! I never had such a great experience for dinner before!  I really had a great time.    We ordered calamari as our appetizer and I order the THE FEENIE BURGER  (smashed certified angus beef®, sautéed mushrooms, aged cheddar, smoked bacon, red relish, mayonnaise, ketchup, mustard)  My other friend ordered the BAJA FISH TACOS (beer battered ocean wise cod, shredded cabbage, chipotle aioli, fire roasted tomato salsa, pickled red onions, jalapeño peppers, sea salted fries).   We were stuffed by the end but Max surprised us again!   He hooked us up with free dessert for the newly graduate.   She was over the moon!  Thank you again Cactus club!  We will be back to dine with you again!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I were hunkering for a burger after a movie and remembered that Cactus Club is just down the road...  We were told that there would be a 20 minute wait but were inside at a table in less than 10 and quickly served our drinks (Ceasar and Fruitini). We ordered the calamari as an appy and was happily surprised that it came with two dips and additional veggies in the mix with the squid. \"THE\" Burger that we ordered came with a side salad (Caesar or tossed) for $1.75 extra but it was well worth it rather than fries. The burger cam on a sweet bun filled with mushrooms, bacon, a home-made patty and all the fixings. It was everything I could do just to finish. Unfortunately no room for dessert.   The service was attentive, quick and our server had lots of good suggestions.   We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Loved the ambience, food and service.  However I realize that the only time I can enjoy all of that is on Saturday lunch time.  Every other time it will be packed with party or suit type people.  Great 90's music playing and the burger sliders were so good and succulent that it was like a main meal on its own! Great to go for a big party that wants to celebrate but the waiting in line might be problematic."}
{"text":"Been enjoying this place for over 10 years. Always excellent services , prompt friendly and fresh. Best consistent restaurant in the city"}
{"text":"Man this place was tasty. Ordered the edamame and other fish apps and they were excellent. Two Caesar drinks were kind of blah. Followed it up with a dark and stormy that was awesome. Had chicken tacos and charred chicken sandwich for mains which were born delish. Prices were fairly high but overall great vibes!!"}
{"text":"This is farely new spot in Downtown Toronto with a lounge bar atmosphere, modern interior and great music selection! The place has two floors, one that is more club-like with live DJ and the other one that is more restaurant-like (not sure if there is 3rd floor). Haven't tried food yet, but will do for sure in the near future! Great place to hang out with friends or colleagues after a long day at work :)"}
{"text":"Definitely a go to while visiting Toronto on a Friday night! Everyone was so nice and helpful definitely enjoyed my experience here and the city is live"}
{"text":"Food is expected and average. But the Tuna Stack and Calamari are above average. It's the corporate industry types' flavour du jour and how can you blame them. The food is decent, the service is never sub-par, and the ambience is quite attractive."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, we sat downstairs but the upstairs is really nice as well. The food was really good and the service was fantastic."}
{"text":"Newly renovated with a billion sets of stairs or elevators to take you to your seats!  I walked into the restaurant and was immediately greeted by two beautiful ladies. The main floor was very modern with wooden bar top tables and it was extremely busy on a Tuesday afternoon.  One of the ladies, escorted me to my table which was all the way at the top of the restaurant.  It was really nicely decorated with a huge bar area, multiple tv's and a projector, heaters on the ceilings to keep warm during the winter months, as well as window ceilings so there the place was nicely lit.  Once seated, I was asked almost immediately if I'd like to start off with anything to drink.  Looking through the menu, they had a wide selection of foods from appetizers, salads, burgers, main courses (which included duck confit, butternut squash ravioli, salmon, steak, sablefish, and many many more).  They also have drink specials for every day of the week, which is always an added bonus.  Once everyone arrived, we decided to start with their Calamari and the Butternut Squash Ravioli with Prawns as the appetizer.  I must warn you that the Butternut Squash Ravioli is to die for!  They are the most delicious ravioli's I have ever tasted.. Melt in your mouth and full of flavour!  I highly highly highly recommend you try it for your main dish or get the appetizer pieces to share.  The Calamari was mediocre, it was too battered for my liking. For my main, I decided to try the Duck Confit (which came with lentils and arugula salad).  From previous experience, I was debating if I should order it because I remember it being extremely salty the last place I had it.  However, this Duck Confit was delicious with just the right amount of salad to balance the saltiness of the duck and the lentils went really well with everything.  The only complaint we had was that the steak that we ordered, was not served as \"medium rare\" like we had asked for.  However, the waitress told us it was because of the lighting of the restaurant that made it look more \"medium\" and also confirmed with the cooks in the kitchen that it was.  We didn't bother asking them to grill us a new piece of steak but the manager of the restaurant was nice enough to come over and apologize about the steak not being cooked to medium-rare.  Overall, I had a great experience, the waitress that we had made sure our needs were met by asking us if we were doing okay several times.  She was very friendly and professional.  The only bad thing is that they are limited in reservations and they happen to be busy all day, every day so you will have to wait to get a seat regardless of how large the restaurant is.. But I promise that it's definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Ohhh! How to describe it ?! They been very welcome and nice. Nice atmosphere in business district area. I tried with my husband to escape from busy stress day for launch. We ordered 2 appetizers. First,Tuna stack which is a highly sophisticated appetizer. Surprising you in all sense! Flavours, avocado layers, fresh soft tuna melting in mouth with crispy crumbs, mandarin and tomato are just very very delicious, combined with winton crispy chips is absolutely worth coming to Toronto downtown. Second, crispy calamari, papers and jalapeño flavoured with dell came with 2 dressings. Calamari rings were very small in size. which I don't like for missing the calamari taste texture.   For main we ordered, hunter chicken was average in flavours, side green beans and small potato were crispy and perfectly crunch. 2nd, finnie burger asked to be with no bacon, served with lovely manager cheering enjoy your No Bacon burger. After first bite! Very juicy and delicious but there are nice 2 slices of Bacon !!! Side kale salad tossing with vingerate onion was amazing  However, they make it up in a very very very nice way for me and my husband, which made it difficult to write this review. I will absolutely give it a second try later."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of both service and food here! I came here for a casual lunch to catch up with a friend after telling him I wanted something similar to Joey's but not Joey's (had bad experiences with service there).   Starting off, we were seated pretty quickly for a busy weekday where the place was swarming with people who worked in offices around the area. A good sign! Then after chatting for a few minutes our waitress promptly came with water and a notepad to take our orders. I barely had to wait--amazing.  The drinks we ordered were delicious and decently strong (a peach bellini and the famed frosé) and the food.... my goodness... cooked to perfection. I ordered the Hunters Chicken which came as a pretty sizeable portion (read: huge for me) garnished with mushrooms, potatoes, and string beans. The chicken was thoroughly cooked but extremely tender; I was so impressed and can honestly say this was the best chicken I've had at a fast casual restaurant. My friend ordered the salmon which was seasoned perfectly and he noted that it felt light yet satisfying.  Overall, a great lunch in the city, and I'll definitely be coming back to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"funny - I went there twice within 2 days since the food is outstanding but the athmosphere obviously chances on a random basis.  first evening: super athmosphere with very friendly and smiling staff. well organized.  second evening (same staff): appeared rather stressed and in a rush, no smile at all and chaotic.   nevertheless - I wont take it personally since there is always a reason behind someones behaviour and since the food is great, I'll be back for sure.  by the way: first evening I had a steak, perfectly cooked to my liking. sideorder: broccoli and mashed. second evening: hunter chicken - this one is my new favourite in calgary! simply a must-eat. great taste"}
{"text":"Good looking waitresses, friendly service and good food. Disappointed with the drinks, though. Old fashioned bourbon was not done well (just tasted like pure whiskey on ice). Caesar had too much clamato juice."}
{"text":"A week ago we were looking for a place to have an informal after work kind of a dinner in the downtown core on a Thursday night. Not too big a group - just a table for 8. But it being late November most of the places we called were booked solid. So we ended up at The Cactus Club Cafe. Normally we would shy away from larger venues like this (Too corporate? Too showy? Too out of the box?) but it turned out really nice. The place was bustling, but even so the service was very attentive and efficient. The scene is pretty corporate but the decor is fun and arty. They have some interesting art (originals apparently) on the wall which was of interest to several members of our party. And the food was really good. I had the ravioli with squash topped with shrimp which was a real rich treat. We shared several appetizers that were also spot on (the calamari wasn't totally to my taste but what can you do?). The noise level was high but not so high as to be a problem. After a drink we all managed to crank up our own volumes to to mutual hearing level. All in all we had a good time - which is what we were looking for. So kudos to the CCC for upsetting my prejudices.   PS - back to my earlier apprehensions, why call it a cafe? It's not."}
{"text":"This place has been on our radar for some time to try. We went in on a Sat at 445pm and it was really busy already. We sat in the lounge, really cool vibe as I was not sure what to expect other than what some reviewers call, a \"high end Moxie's\". That is about right and the washrooms have to be mentioned as they are really cool! Our waitress was really sweet but not on her game at all. Very forgetful about pretty about everything - menus, lemon for water, ground pepper. Drinks - for him, the beer was served perfectly cold and I had the Sangria they had on special for Saturdays. SO delicious with the muddled fresh berries, very refreshing. The food was very good, we noted some appies have a better value than others. I got the butternut squash ravioli and prawn trio and it was very good (and I am picky about ravioli) but you get 3 small pieces for $13. The prawns were fresh and not frozen. LOVE! He ordered the Korean lettuce wraps and for $15 you get a lot of food. It was delicious, the pork was so moist and tender, the rice was cooked to perfection and the lettuce was, well iceberg lettuce but a nice change from the ordinary.  I did leave hungry but that is my own fault for not ordering more! The reason I did not is that what we did order took so long to come out and we had to get going. It was just too early for us for a big, heavy meal. The calamari at the next table looked amazing, we will try that next time! The menu items with RF circled beside them mean that they are a Rob Feenie (CDN Iron Chef) specialty and I will stick to those in the future I think. YUM! I can see why this place gets so busy and it is nice to know that in the north end we have a nice go-to restaurant like this!"}
{"text":"I met a bunch of friends here for dinner.  Luckily one of them was able to arrive early and reserve a table.  I know there is a long wait time if you just rock up expecting to eat and I saw quite the line when I arrived.  It's definitely best to make a reservation.  It's a really classy looking place and the server was very attentive despite it being super busy.  They had beer specials so Heineken was $6.25 which isn't bad for an upscale bar.  Most of us ordered the burger (with bacon/cheddar) for $16.75 - a little pricey but it tasted great.  The ceviche is also a good option.    At some points it got too loud to have a conversation.  We were at a table close to the bar so there were lots of people standing around chatting.  Would have preferred the music to be turned down a bit but it's intended to be a social place to grab some drinks.  I think there's lots of hype about Cactus Club at the moment and I really enjoyed my experience there."}
{"text":"Came here one sunday for the first time for a friends birthday  We hadnt reserved , just walked in. Wanted the patio & so we headed up for some drinks until a table was ready, took about half an hour   Really like this place GREAT music, bit loud  Great food  Acceptable service, considering its craaazy busy   I got the jambalaya rice bowl, SUPER TASTY Took it to work the next day, best lunch ever lol   The truffle fries are bomb! Looove them   All in all will be back, ive tried to actually but they wont take reservations under a week and a half because theyre already fully booked"}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is delicious! My favourite is the mixed bowl with Atlantic salmon and the creole chicken ( not on the menu but they will make it if you request it). I've also tried other dishes through winter and summerlicious and I've always been happy with the food! There is a variety of of seating areas such as the bars, dining rooms, rooftop and out door patio so you can come here for literally any occasion!  Make sure you make a reservation ahead of time!!!"}
{"text":"Met my friend at the bar. Told to wait for front patio not told how long. Ordered drinks, I had a wine spritzer $8 and my friend had an old fashioned $12.Paid for our drinks at the bar. Finally instructed a seat was available for us on patio, but that we would need to vacate at 7:30p. Upon our surprised looks, hostess said she would find a different seat for us. Delicious dinner for me: truffle fries, ravioli shrimp. My friend had the berry cheesecake. While we are in deep conversation, 7:45p approaches and we are informed we need to vacate our seats. We were not offered any other option for seating, so we decided to leave. We glanced at our seats as we were leaving and the table had been set, but no one had arrived. We received an ironic \"Every customer leaves happy\" brochure with our bills, so I shared our experience with them.  This is a nice location, it's hip and in the moment. Seats are comfortable and the food is delicious. Alana, our server was lovely as was our bartender. Regrettably, the manager or whomever turfed us didn't seem terribly customer oriented."}
{"text":"In the few times I've been to Cactus Club, I've had the opportunity to try a wide variety of items on their menu and am consistently impressed every time! The must-try on the menu is the butternut squash ravioli with prawns - this is HEAVENLY. I struggle with wanting to try a new item on the menu or stick with this go-to order and it always wins out. Luckily, I have a great group of friends that also love Cactus Club and are nice enough to order other items and let me try their food :)   With a chill-hip vibe and a great drink menu to boot, Cactus Club definitely hits all the right spots to earn a 4-star rating."}
{"text":"My first time going to Cactus Club and I'm super impressed with how they rune their service, truly well deserved 5 stars.  I came in for dinner, and there was already a reservation list for a Thursday night but I accept the one hour wait, as Ive always heard good things about the cactus club.   The service was amazing, waitresses smiling and polite, she was on the ball, with timing, weather it was drinks or food or fresh cutlery she smiled through the night.  The kitchen looked like it was run professionally chefs in white aprons, cooking away. It looked and felt like a top restaurant.  Food was exquisite, nothing too memorable but everything was good perfectly cooked even the asparagus was very tender. Everything was perfectly seasoned.  Drinks were also amazing, I had the best peach Bellini ever. Sweet and fruity.   The bathrooms were clean and stocked very well  This newly established restaurant DOES NOT disappoint, I hope to one day work for them. Rock on Cactus Club"}
{"text":"Went in for some drinks with friends after an event in the south end . Had not yet been to this location. Dim, classy space, interesting menu choices topped off with good service. Fridays are $1 off one type of beer and also martinis. I had 2 martinis and found them very average.  All of the food coming out of the kitchen looked good and I have no doubt that it tastes just as good here as the other location in the NE. Our waitress was always coming around making sure we had what we needed without being a pest. Bathrooms were cool too. After a couple of drinks, figuring out a \"foot flush\" is an interesting concept!"}
{"text":"Just got out the maple leafs game and sercuity would not let us in, Said dress code on friday and sat when its a thrusday night, he let other people in as long as they took off their hats off and they were white and we are brown... discrimination by the security...   ***** Cactus Club for the Last year on Google Reviews has had many racist problems here at their place of business and say we take these matters very seriously and it seems they dont because its still happening? We live in a world where this should never happen and They are getting away with this?  Why are they so special in toronto? Why Do they have so much control on who they decide can come and go?  I am just shocked on how many people have given them a bad rating on Yelp and Google and still get 4 stars?  This happened to me one week ago and Its still bother me and I am think of reaching out to all the people that have had bad experiences and get a Class Action Lawsuits and Contact the Human Rights Act... CACTUS CLUB needs to step up and take action and retrain their system... I am sure at the end of day I am one voice and at the end of day this will get swept under the rug Because Cactus management does not care and will continue to discriminate and only allow whites and well dressed patrons, Makes me sick!!!!!!!!!!  Just to Spoke Guest Relations and Was told the Matter is closed due to the fact, the Sercurity Team and Cactus Management Came to the conclusion to save their butts that we looked drunk and was deined entrance because of that and not because we were brown? WOW!!! 1st I ever heard that we looked drunk... Talking about protecting Toronto Business and Hiding the problem that is happening with this Place... I am going to write a letter to the Prime Minister of Canada!!! thank you for Letting the system down Catcus Club and Corporate...."}
{"text":"Love trying new places for the first time, you have no idea what to expect, whether you'll love it or hate it, think that's why I enjoy eating out. Luckily for cactus club cafe, their food was some of the best I've tasted in toronto, from the hot wings( which I was surprised I enjoyed) to the grilled asparagus, everything was done to a way above satisfactory level. The wings were paired with what tasted like a house made ranch sauce, no exaggeration it was the best ranch dip I've tasted, being a sauce enthusiast I don't mess around when it comes to dips. The appetizer came relatively quick considering it was a full house on a Friday night. I ordered the filet, which was perfectly season and cooked correctly. It was served buttery mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus. The girlfriend ordered the butternut squash ravioli, I 100% recommend ordering that if you come to cactus club, it was phenomenal. If you're a wine lover you'll enjoy their fairly large selections. The waitress was very pleasant, all the servers had a smile on their face, very warm employees. Restaurant was maybe a touch too dim for my liking but all In all a great experience. 4 stars because some of the items seemed to be on the more expensive side, they should adjust their prices accordingly.     Update, changed rating to a 5 star, the happy hour pricing is phenomenal. Good job guys."}
{"text":"Drew was wearing an underarmor sweatshirt and they still let us in even though a sign out front said  \"proper attire\" was required so good on them for that. It's incredibly obvious that this is a place where people go to find a sugar daddy. I don't know how else to put it but when you have two 20 something's grinding up on a 40 year old in an Armani suit, you know there's a plan. Aside from that we were surprised by how cheap the drinks were and the Moscow Mules, although a bit sweet, were very down-able. If you like a club that has a good vibe and alternates between Drake and Bieber every other song then this is your place."}
{"text":"We went on saturday night with a group of 7 people, we all had a great experience. Everyone loved their meals and drinks. I had my reservations about going back however, I'm glad I did and will continue to go back to cactus club. The managers really care about client feed back and address any concerns and find a way to go above and beyond in making sure that we have a great time. I haven't been back since August, so I noticed a lot of great new changes with how organized they were from having runners walk you to your table to the waitresses checking to see if our meals were good. Can't wait to go back with my girlfriends again. I really missed the food at Cactus club."}
{"text":"Service was great. Aisha was super!!! Even though some of the party was 2hrs late, she took great care of us. Food was great. I would recommend the double braised short rib.  The Negroni was well balanced for a cocktail.  Even though our table was near the bar it was not overly noisy and the DJ was playing some great hits. Will come again."}
{"text":"This chain tries to fill the gap between upscale restaurant and trendy bar, but unfortunately does not particularly exceed at either.  I ate dinner here on a Friday night, and the ambiance was quite unique. Even without a reservation, my party of 3 was seated within 5 minutes, maybe we got lucky. Anyway, the vibe is a weird mix of your modern restaurant with a bar/club feel. There was a birthday party on the rooftop, and you could hear the music pumping through the walls. A little bit distracting for some people, but it was okay for me.  4/5 - Food 3/5 - Overall Experience  The food is on the pricier side, considering this is not a a strict restaurant per se, as some of the appetizers ran near $20. At those prices for an appetizer you start entering the same price range as a true fine dining restaurant. My group had some butternut squash shrimp ravioli to share, which was 3 pieces for $16. I tried the bacon cheese burger, and the other two entrees were the Jambalaya bowl, and some short rib pasta.  The burger was good, though nothing spectacular for a $18 burger, considering the cheese was your processed orange American cheese. The short rib pasta had healthy chunks of braised rib, though they erred on the pastier drier side. The Jambalaya bowl was good, with well seasoned sauce and fragrant rice. The ravioli was very delicious, but considering the filling was squash, and with only one shrimp per ravioli, the price is steep. The cocktails are good, and served creatively. I enjoyed a Moscow Mule in a copper mug. They also had steaks, but I would prefer to support local steakhouses for a similar price.  Considering this place deems itself per their website \"a casual fine dining experience\", I'd say it was much more on the casual side. We were seated at a table before it was set and ready. There was sticky sauce residue on the table, and I had to ask my server to wipe it down for me. There were no introductions or any communication really from the server, she just came to refill water, take drink and food orders, and that was it.  Overall, this restaurant chain is a upscale, 'fancier' Milestones, with the prices to match. Plenty of other local options in Toronto at similar price points, with better service, and similar ambiance and quality of food."}
{"text":"I went to this place for happy hour and overall, the food and drinks were great. We ordered one of everything on the $3 menu which included the fries, fish taco, mini fried chicken sandwich, and a mini burger. My favourite was the fish taco, super fresh and delicious! For the drink, I had a summer smash with vodka and it tasted really similar to a mojito which is exactly what I wanted. It was $9.60 if you swap the gin out with vodka and $8.25 if you don't swap.  The only criticism I have is that is service there is really unwelcoming. Since it was happy hour, there were a lot of business people in suits coming after work so no one really seemed to care about us maybe because we looked younger than a lot of people there. Our server went up to everyone several times but only stopped by my table once or twice in the end to see if we were done. The food and drinks were great overall, but if you don't come with a group of business people, you probably won't be taken seriously."}
{"text":"Tried the salmon here for lunch, and really enjoyed it. I expected it to come out in small portions but the portion size was definitely very filling.  The soy-Dijon went really well with the salmon, and the whole grain barley, mushrooms and tomatoes complimented the salmon very well."}
{"text":"So I went to the Cactus club this weekend on a date and it was fantastic. We arrived around 7:30 pm and only had to wait 5 minutes which I was surprised about because it is rather popular and it was a Saturday night. We were seated by the door that leads outside and that's not the best place but it still was pretty nice. My only complaint was that our waitress was a bit of a ditz. She couldn't remember if we had ordered our meal yet and asked three times along with if she was being too nosy. No good!!  We ordered Rob Feenie's flat bread which was delicious. I think I'll have that as my main meal next time!!! That man is a talented chef. My date had the salmon, which I tasted and it was delicious. Fork tender and melt in your mouth. I had the burger, which was of course delicious. Again kudos to Rob Feenie! We did not get dessert but next time, I'm skipping the appie and getting dessert instead. Everything was absolutely delicious and they were not rushing us at all. We were there for 3 hours and it was great.   I would definitely reccomend the cactus club for younger ones and not so much families. There were families in there and it was fine, but the vibe that it gives off is for a night out with the girls, dates or young couples. It is very modern and the music is quite loud. However, it is one of the best restaurants Ive ever been to.."}
{"text":"Overview: good, nothing special but great patio   We opted for the patio which was a great decision.  They have a great patio area.  We ordered a bunch of apps to share and a salad. We got the tuna stack,  spicy chicken,  fish tacos and raincoast green salad. And a massive pitcher of sangria.  A bit ambitious but dang it, we four girls did it.  This place is essentially Joey's but more expensive.  The best was the the tuna stack (fresh,  tasty, and an all around great apps comes with chips which is great for sharing). Least favourite was the salad.  The chicken was dry,  and I mean dry. Staff were friendly and atmosphere was nice. I'd really only go back to sip sangria on their kick ass patio."}
{"text":"Finally made our way over to this place Thursday after work. As anticipated and experienced in the past, this is a bit of a hot spot due to location and now that it's warm, that rooftop patio.   We arrived around 6pm and there was approx. 40 minute wait for a table. However, we could go upstairs to stand by the bar and have drinks...and that's exactly what we did.   2 hours later a table upstairs still didn't become available so we were willing to take any table. We were seated on the 2nd floor, which was really dark - perhaps nice for date night but it just made me want to fall asleep.   I had the tuna stack to start which was as many thumbs up as possible. I loved this starter and I had the baja tacos as my entree. This was a bit more disappointing - very deep fried and made me feel a bit regretful after the fact.   Our server was fantastic and the menu had plenty of options and the drinks were great so....eat and learn! :)"}
{"text":"Delicious food and a wide variety of choices from appetizers to main dishes and desserts."}
{"text":"I tend to go here on occasion as it's a convenient place to meet my parents. After I had ran a race we decided to meet her to eat.   It wasn't busy so we sat outside on the patio, which is very nice. Lots of chair types to relax on or eat depending what you want.   I had the spinach salad with salmon and sangria. The sangria is always good there! And my salad was delicious. The salmon was cooked well. The boys in my group had chicken tenders and fries and they all said it was good.   Definitely a good place to go for a nice meal with friends or family."}
{"text":"Very bad first time experience!  We arrived at 6:45pm, they told us there is 45 mins wait.  That's fine they sent us upstair in the 2nd floor to stand and wait.  We ordered 2 drinks, on the menu, Sunday special is $1 off signature sangria which is in the menu for $8.  And we ordered a 6 oz red wine which should be $11.  However we got charged $10.50 for sangria and $17 for red wine. Our server who is also the manager there named Leah, her explanation is she ordered a large version of sangria for us which is not on the menu and she also ordered 9 oz instead of 6 oz wine as well.  She apologized and said that she will give us the credit back on our dinner bill.  Worse of all, she credited us $4!  Don't know how she calculated that! We feel like we got ripped off!   Other than that food overall are good, we recommend the tuna stack appetizer and caramel mouse with toffee crunch for dessert.  Our waitress is very nice too.  Our advice is check your bill before paying for your drinks at the bar."}
{"text":"I went to the Cactus Club Cafe for lunch with two friends last Thursday. Since they were not too hungry, we ordered from the start & share section. The butternut squash and mascarpone ravioli, truffle butter sauce, sautéed jumbo prawns, pine nuts was very tasty. I really enjoyed the sauce.  The second dish was the TUNA STACK  ocean wise albacore, citrus tamari vinaigrette, nori, sesame, avocado, micro cilantro, wonton chips. The wonton chips went very well this dish. The ambiance in the venue was very pleasant. There are three floors and the top was a patio lounge. They have their own elevator inside the restaurant, so if you are going on the second floor or third for your table, usually a pretty waitress will come with you. Overall, the food was good and I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This place is one of my top 5 restaurant to go to for good food, good service, good music and good vibes. The best part is the rooftop lounge, however the dining area inside is beautiful with dim lights and classy decor. Everything on the menu was good, my favourite is the truffle fries and the chicken wonton app."}
{"text":"Had a lunch get together for our team at work and some them of wanted to try CCC as we had been unsuccessful in the past to get a larger reservation. We were 8 of us but seated in a circular booth meant for 7. So a bit tight to sit and were ready to leave soon as it was a bit uncomfortable.   Requested a Garden Burger with no cheese and mayo. After a few minutes got the bad news that the cheese is already in the burger and cannot be made dairy free. Had to settle for a Modern Bowl which comes with tabbouleh, rice with miso carrot ginger sauce a side of half an avocado, salad and other fixings.   The tabbouleh was good, the rice perfectly cooked and the star of the dish was the miso carrot ginger sauce. The sauce hit the right notes, perfect blend of mild ginger spice and seasoning the salad with cauliflower and broccoli were noted. The pineapple salsa was hardly noticed. The avocado grilled but not skinned (why?).   The service great, the atmosphere and just feel was amazing. Wish we could have stayed longer and had a few more vegan options."}
{"text":"I was at cactus on Saturday evening with some friends who love coming here. This was my first time and I was unimpressed. I debated writing a review but thought that I should do other people can steer clear of the uneducated staff they seem to harbour. Our server Laura was slow, inexperienced and came off as a a doe-brain. She said the kale salad was like a Caesar salad, boy was she ever wrong.   She was never available when needed. She never asked if I would like another beverage so I never ended up ordering one, I stuck to the water she never topped up. A manager (I assume, in different dress) came by to fill it up.   This was my first time at cactus and I have no desire to return."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for a fancy-esque date with my lady. I would recommend it for a laid back but nice dinner"}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday. There were 4 of us on a cold Monday evening on Feb/17. As we got to the restaurant we got seated right away. Usually this place is stooshy sometimes in the summer and your waiting for hours for resos. But winter, I guess not so much. We were lucky enough to be seated inside a booth seat .. nice and cozy.  The waitress asked us what the occasion was for and we told her it was our girlfriend's birthday. There were 2 waitresses that were assisting our table since one of them was a newbie who was on training.   As we ordered, we all picked a total of 5 dishes for the 4 of us to share, this way we can try everything. The food was great, nothing bad to say about it.  Ambience was great too and we liked the old school hip-hop music they were playing.   Prices were about a $$$, not bad for downtown core. Parking is a bit tricky to find and there were a few one-way streets. So make sure you plan your route if your driving here. We had to walk 2 blocks to arrive to the restaurant because we had no idea where to park.    Overall, would I come back? Yes probably ... I'll attempt it again in the summer but the last time I came here in the summer it was very hard to get a table esp on the patio."}
{"text":"Absolutely brutal experience here yesterday.  We came in here after the pride parade 4 adults a child and a baby. A well behaved baby when we arrived. There was a 10 - 15 minute wait - we completely understood.  We waited and were took to our table - to our surprise our table  was missing a chair - we took one from another table and then jammed the high chair on the corner.  Fine whatever.  We waited for our server to get our drink order - we ordered.  We waited approx 10 minutes for our drinks.  Heres where it goes downhill.  A couple that came in after us - was seated after us no worries.  Our server takes her drink order. Delivers their drinks, takes their food orders.  Then another table of 6 adults comes in - takes their drink order - delivers their drinks - forgets one then comes back with it- now bear in mind this is all painfully slow - and she is then proceeds to  begin  to take their order.  We have now been waiting close to 20 minutes for her to take our food order - we have gone from having a happy baby to an unhappy baby - an impatient 10 year old and 4 cold, tired adults - (its now approx 245 pm).  In the history of my adult life, I did something I have never done, and never thought I would do - but I interjected while she was about to take their order and said  \"  Excuse me, I am sorry,  but we have been waiting for 20 minutes, you need to please take our order - I essentially insisted she take our order. first- What the hell was she thinking?    I didnt feel good doing it, but I had had enough.  The service was appalling and lacking any common sense - I was in the server industry for many years in casual and fine dining and had to shake my head.  THe food as usual was good once it arrived, but this young lady serving really needed to assess her section and prioritize and think.    I wont go back to this location - it seemed manic and disorganized.  i hated being in a position where I had to speak up to the degree I did, but it was ridiculous.  Cactus club food and standards are better than this."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for happy hour.  Although the food wasn't all that amazing, the patio is gold! The cocktails + this patio = love.  It's such a wonderful spot to just people watch and hangout especially at lunch on a workday or during happy hour as you can see the people hustling and bustling around town."}
{"text":"I'm really glad that we decided to try this place when we were visiting Toronto!   Though they are unsurprisingly thronged (better make reservations) at dinner on Friday, when we came back for lunch on Sunday it was much less crowded.  We got the fish tacos and the thai chicken lettuce wraps.   Both were outstanding!   They have a pretty decent cocktail menu and beer list as well.   Lastly, our servers were very attentive and pleasant to deal with.  If I ever go back to Toronto, I'll be wanting to go back!"}
{"text":"Service on point. Ashley took care of the whole family. A place you go for amazing food and service. If you ask for large value, go here."}
{"text":"always my #1 spot to go for a rooftop patio. Toronto feel 100%"}
{"text":"There are a few dishes that I love at the Cactus Club  1. Calamari - yummy and generous portions - the sauces are amazing  2. Teriyaki Chocken Rice Bowl -  My most favorite Entree on the whole menu!!!!  It's so yummy!!!!   3. Short Rib Sandwich - Meat is juicy and not dry."}
{"text":"I always go to cactus as it is my go too.. however this time around I order the spaghetti and meatball entree and when it was brought out and I took the first bite it was so cold. The service was good but the food lacked .. really disappointed ."}
{"text":"Kind of a gong show tonight...   My food was fine... rare NY strip was actually rare... not best overall, but maybe I should have ordered another cut...  The wait staff somehow managed to frustrate my dinner companions (who are in the industry themselves and typically pretty forgiving) by adding meat to the vegetarian's salad.  I suspect the situation wasn't made better by picking the pieces out back in the kitchen... (sort of logical ...sort of not really?)... Anyways, I was just a slightly bemused observer as everything got kinda tense... and quiet... no one talking... mad about the food.  Something about the wine got everyone upset too.  All very dramatic.  No worries for me...I was fine... but maybe because all I ordered wad a rare steak alone (with nothing else on the plate and a glass of water).  Steak and drama on a Wednesday night.  Maybe stay away if it's Stampede and you're in a complicated mood.  When you're in the mood for chain Quinoa salad... Beef carpacio and maybe... say... edemame... it's a pretty good time.  Not a superfan of the faux-ambiance for the after-work crowd... but hey, when in Rome..."}
{"text":"Once you get there it's nice but man the girl who takes over the phone reservations is miserable and so rude."}
{"text":"I'm rating 5 based on the food and the atmosphere. We went for summerlicious and had a table of 5 for lunch on the rooftop patio. Beautiful scenery and the food was well presented and tasted great. However, if I was to rate on the service I'd probably give a 3. Our waitress couldn't answer basic questions and always had to go \"check with her manager\". I had ordered a coke which never came, the service was slow, the waitress had an issue about bringing my friend's dessert upstairs even though she said it was fine when she ordered it (some policy about the dessert being made downstairs and transporting, I didn't understand it), etc. Food was good though and I had been meaning to check out the patio so that was nice."}
{"text":"First time here and I see swarms of Bay Street people having lunch meetings. However, this place is trendy and comfortable. By noon time, this place is packed! Another note: the service staff's attitude are top notch and they are like a well oiled machine.   The venue is nicely designed with two separate floors that allows corporate events on one floor and still have other patrons to the other floor. I like that design.   Onto the food, I ordered the Rain Coast Greens. Flavour can be on the blend side. But it is a healthy lunch, so I can't complain about the taste. On the nutrient scale, I will give it a 10 though for the natural ingredients used.   I recommend this place for trendy and upscale to take a date to or for corporate functions."}
{"text":"The food here is just OK. Portions are small for the money you pay. Service is adequate.  They seemed to have spent a lot of money on this Vancouver chain's decoration/design as it does look amazing - all 3 floors. Next focus more on the food.  Office crowd during lunch and after work. But definitely a lot louder after work (in the \"I cant hear you\" sense)."}
{"text":"I've loved Cactus Club for over 10 years and I've been to this one twice now and I just love it.  Whenever I'm in Alberta or BC I try and get to a Cactus Club.  The menu is very well planned and really is worded so well you can visualize the food in your head before you order.   I love their selection of beers too !!  I had the UGLY beer and it was really nice. Love the west coast and all the micro breweries.  Tonight was having dinner with my colleague Chris. There was a bout a 20 minute wait for the dinning room, so we chose a booth in the lounge. The hockey game was on the big screen and all the other screens had various sports games.   He ordered the burger and I ordered the short rib sandwich. Chris said the burger was good (I've had it there before and really good).   The short rib sandwich arrived and it looked kind of small on a big plate with fries (see photo), however it was likely the best sandwich I've ever had, it melted in your mouth. The meat was slow cooked and the sauce very delicate and just the right amount on the lightly toasted bread. All in all it was so much I could finish it.  The place is always hopping, but even with so many people it wasn't loud as Chris and I could talk throughout our meal with out having to always say 'what?\".....which is a nice change from some busy bar / restaurant's in the area. Very nice atmosphere. The lounge decor is very trendy and fits the space well.  Our server was very polite, remembered everything and was very knowledgeable about the menu and the beer selections."}
{"text":"4.5 stars rounded up   I admit, I wasn't expecting greatness from Cactus Club Cafe's menu; it wouldn't be fair to have all that airy 3rd floor patio ambience, a DJ spinning top 40, gorgeous waitresses, AND a good Sunday brunch spread, but CCC manages to have it all.   I loved everything we ordered: - Szechuan chicken lettuce wraps (to share) was properly spicy & had plenty of chicken breast & green onion. So addictive! - I would've been happy with butternut squash ravioli; the firm, buttery shrimp were a bonus!  - a refreshing Summer Smash (their creative drink menu made it difficult to choose just one!)   CCC gets an \"A\" in my book!"}
{"text":"I loved Cactus Club in Vancouver, it was a daily spot for me and my friends to catch up. The location here has a far more fancier interior and atmosphere than the one in Vancouver. The staff was super attentive but the atmosphere of the staff was really professional which made it a little uncomfortable just because it's not what I was expecting. The food was great though (my boyfriend had the Creole Steak + Prawns and I had the Jambalya Rice Bowl - it's my fav!"}
{"text":"Love Cactus Club. The food is pretty great and the music works for me. Favourites: tuna stack, tuna stack, tuna stack, fish tacos, papardelle, duck club, fish tacos, frosé and white sangria. Staff are very accommodating and friendly.  It is definitely on the pricier side, and the wait can be pretty rough (though usually not as long as they quote). Always a good idea to make a reso whenever you can though.   Lots of bar options (one on every floor) to sip on something while you wait, but can feel pretty crowded (even for those seated) on a busy night.   Mildly annoying that they don't serve the same menu up on the rooftop.  Lots of suits."}
{"text":"Here's a chain restaurant that actually has some decent food. The atmosphere is quite nice and location is very central, so it's a nice place to go after work or on weekends. I came here with friends on a Saturday evening so we had to wait almost an hour to be seated and we were told that the wait would've been even longer for the patio. We killed time by getting a drink from the bar, unfortunately it took them a while to take a drink orders, but they do have some good drinks. The food was quite good, prices are on par with other chains like Earl's. Their truffle fries are to die for, definitely some of the best that I've had, maybe even better than the fries from the holts cafe.   Give this place a try, especially if you usually hit up restaurants like Jack Astor's, Earl's, etc."}
{"text":"Traveling on business and other two restaurants I looked up were only serving drinks while they shut down kitchen to prep for dinner. Past by Cactus Club Cafe on back to hotel. Ordered appetizers, calamari and truffle fries. Both are good and the dipping sauces are nice. Sangria was great."}
{"text":"Racist place. Everyone is wearing hockey jerseys inside we were denied access by from security acting like he owned it. He made people take their hats off to eat inside and told people it's a dress code to eat. Called the manager nick to tell him about racist incident he said their is no dress code but wouldn't help talk to the guy downstairs. Nick was trying to avoid the issues and started making up other excuses why we were being denied access. After spending over $300 the night before come on what a joke. They are on the news for being racist to a baseball player now us. Going to call corporate and other resources to correct these rookie manager and his want to be front desk security acting like he owns the place. He told us we made exceptions for people what a joke and told us to go eat somewhere else. Terrible messed up our night and made us think about racism in these types of establishment still exist. You guys haven't done anything to fix all the problems here at your restaurant. You obviously don't take it seriously maybe a lawsuit is order. Jenna Pacholko Manager, Cactus Club Cafe - FCP is also a racist. She is avoiding calling back after several messages left. She doesn't want to correct the issues of racism because she is a racist herself."}
{"text":"My husband and I came on a Saturday night. I was surprised to see how busy the restaurant was considering we were in the downtown core. There was a constant line-up for the restaurant. We sat in the lounge, which was club-like with the customers and music.  The food was delicious. Seafood here is high quality, fresh and beautifully presented. We tried the ahi tuna, prawns and butternut squash ravioli and fish tacos. The prawns in particular tasted as fresh as I can get in Vancouver. All three dishes were very different from each other but excellent. Not what you expect from a chain restaurant.   We drank beers, froze and a big glass of wine. I enjoyed my meal and thought it was well worth $100 + for all that quality seafood and booze. My husband still prefers to go to Shokunin, which is in that price range and also offers amazing seafood. If you want to be out and are in the core, you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Started with calamari, and I ordered port wine salmon as entree. Finished with lava cake as dessert. All were amazing! Good for a business lunch and friends gathering!"}
{"text":"Overrated restaurant for sure. It's slightly fancier than other chains like Moxies and Milestones but nothing to rave about. Food was ok, service ok, decor was also nothing special you wanted to take pictures of. Overall, a good restaurant, nothing special."}
{"text":"This place is incredibly confusing to me. Via their website, they are a restaurant with innovative menus but in person, they are a luxury venue with no patience for mere mortals. I was staying nearby at a hotel and I had been working all day so I had not had a chance to eat lunch. I was starving, it was very close to my hotel, and the online menu looked like something I would be interested in.  I meandered over around 6 pm on a Friday. I assumed it was early so as a single person, I would not have a problem either waiting a short while for a bar or grabbing a table. As I approached, I saw a gaggle of about 5 douchey looking bros who were clearly \"guarding\" the entrance. Nearby were four insipid chicks in skintight, way too short dresses standing around in the cold, doing lord knows what. They were employees based on their attire and I felt sorry for them, freezing out there.   I went inside and waited in the line. A lady in the same skintight, way too short blue dress comes up and asks me about my situation. I say I'd like to eat. She tells me it is a 2.5 hr wait for a table and the bar is standing room only aka don't even consider eating here, we only want to gouge you on overpriced drinks.   I got the general sense that this place is only for people who know somebody in Toronto and being an out of towner, clearly I was not on the list. If you are from out of town, don't waste your time."}
{"text":"The place for lunch in Calgary near the airport!  The duck club sandwich with duck bacon, breast, and Hoisin Sauce on raisin/ walnut bread with yam fries knocks it out of the park!  About as trendy as it gets in Calgary for lunch.  Don't miss it, 3 locations."}
{"text":"I love cactus club! Impeccable service, food and drinks. This was my 2nd time - the first time I had the jambalaya which was super tasty at first - a bit too much vinegar as you continue eating it. But it was a lovely blend of flavours. The 2nd time, I had the butternut squash ravioli with prawns which was to DIE FOR. Simply amazing. I also had the Brazilian cocktail which was delish!   The restaurant is beautiful and huge - lovely patio and rooftop patio. The service is always quick and all the staff are very attentive.   Note that the prices are on the high-end and it can be tough to get a table during busy times - but its definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"It makes sense to me that this place is so popular.  It definitely had that chic trendy vibe.  I really enjoyed everything about it.  The atmosphere, the multi layered design and three decker effect.  The rooftop was extremely nice touch.  Had sort of an upscale sporty chic vibe like if you were at a high end tennis golfing establishment and you sat on the rooftop in the middle of manhattan haha.  Weird correlations but maybe it will make sense when you check it out.  The food was pretty delicious hands down, the truffle fries ... best french fries i've ever had in my entire life.  Our server who served 9 was a PRO.  Extremely nice and accommodating and swift and always checking in on our table.  To be honest he's mastered the craft, I could tell.  Didn't break a sweat.  Yes he forgot to put salad dressing on the side of my friends salad dish like she requested, but HE caught it himself, and leaned over and apologized to my friend.  I really commend him for noticing because most servers will forget the details at times, but the fact that he caught himself and made mention, really made amends.  His name was brandon aka bran muffin and he was extremely patient had a lot of knowledge about the food..and a great attitude, and sense of humor and care.  i would definitely come back to try more food, and hope to come across brandon aka bran muffin haha. (inside joke).      i personally ordered the tuna stack it was delicious alongside the truffle fries soooo delicious!  Portion wise the tables food was presentable and everyone at the table admitted that their food was excellent.  I think portions could be a tad more generous, but other than that, a extremely satisfied customer.  Unfortunately due to the crowd the restaurant draws in, it does get extremely busy and its hard to get reservations and there can be a lot of wait times."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last night. Loved the fact they didn't impose a dress code as I was dressed casually. May have been because it was a Wednesday.   Service overall is very attentive and friendly. Gentleman at host table took us to our seats at the bar as we waited for our table. He ensured we had two seats rather than many places which make you search yourself. Bar waitress was super friendly, worked fast and pleasant.   Come here for the cocktails but not the food. Cocktails were so flavourful and presented nicely. However both our dishes were way too salty. I had the BBQ Peking duck sandwich. Towards the end you could actually taste salt granules. It seems like seasoned each of the three meats in salt and then the sand which spread as well. It's way too much. The other dish we had - double braised pineapple short rib - was too flavourful as well. The pineapple ginger glaze needs to be diluted.   Place is super clean including washrooms. Would recommend going again for drinks."}
{"text":"Went late one night. Food was very good but our server was annoyed at us because we were ordering more food and drinks. At one point she rolled her eyes at us and told us that we need ed to pay for the bill NOW but we were not done. Sucks to get shitty service! Too bad it only takes one person who hates her job to ruin your experience. Food 4/5 Service 0/5"}
{"text":"i love the cocktail!! not too strong and i had a very unforgettable birthday there! i also like the pasta!"}
{"text":"Great food, great vibe, great drinks. Long wait even during \"down\" time - for good reason though! Recommend making a reservation in advance. Patio is amazing!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great food, and the place is jamming on a Monday night.  Professional from the walk in to the check.  Great shopping experience.  Trendy modern atmosphere."}
{"text":"I used to be a regular here. Until they took off the happy hour menu. This place was my go to with my girls and now we would just rather go to a nearby bar that offers just as tasty food and drinks for a better price. I will miss you CACTUS goodbye."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance with great music. I took my friends from Paris to Cactus this week. They liked their food very much"}
{"text":"My experience at the Cactus Club was to die for! 100% satisfied.  I ordered a quesadilla (which I usually dont order at restaurants because I find lower quality establishments have them frozen and come out soggy..) and it was PHENOMENAL. It was delicious, it was fresh, crisp, and not soggy what so ever.  My drink was my favourite, called Everything Pink (or something like that), it was summery, sweet and had a citrus kick which I was a huge fan of.  My man got the Jack Daniels burger, which I must say, was. Absolutely. Perfect.  I can honestly say I have never had a better burger in my life.  The waitresses were professional, looked well dressed and put together. And were also absolutely beautiful. The atmosphere screamed quality as well. Overall, very professional, and definitely now my absolute favourite restaurant."}
{"text":"This Cactus Club is getting better and better as every time I come here to hangout. Great foods, great ambient, service need some improvement, maybe new staff, my steak was really really good, cooked to medium rare and nicely seared outside, great!"}
{"text":"Went to the bar on Canada Day and our first bartender was great- we closed our first round of drinks right away tipped above average and hung out. We decided to get another drink from the first bartender and because our old tab was sitting out the other bartender tried to charge us for those as well- I explained to her that we already paid for those first drinks with a card and that the other bartender was grabbing drinks so she could help others if she wanted. We paid cash for the second round and left cash sitting on the counter- again an above average amount, and when we were leaving the bartender who was hassling us about not paying for the first round (although I have credit card receipts that say otherwise) rolled her eyes as she counted the tip that was left.   I was beyond annoyed.  This is NEVER acceptable in a service job, I know I've worked them before and been left nothing or very little to nothing before, but that just comes with the job, you just hope others balance it out.   VERYYY SNOBBY BAR, I will NEVER go back here, and that's a very rare statement for me to make."}
{"text":"This place was PACKED on Tuesday night. Me and 3 friends were only able to get available seating on the covered patio upstairs! Great place to get drinks after work and unwind with the good food and pumping music.   Ordered : wings, tuna and calamari - all amazing.   Only caution: the upper patio does a condensed version of the full menu. You have to go to first 2 floors for the full menu.  Venue - spacious and modern   Would highly recommend especially for the young professional crowd"}
{"text":"I've lived in Canada for quite a few years now and am really sad this was my first time at Cactus Club Cafe! I could have been going here regularly! Well, here on out this is my place to go. I went here for an after work social dinner and had the best time. The staff were super friendly and efficiently dealt with a large group of us. I ordered a whisky sour which was expertly made, and then for dinner took a chance on the fish tacos. They came with chips and salsa and the fish was cooked perfectly. It was battered but not greasy like sometimes it can be at other places. The peppers and cabbage came on the side so I was able to make them to my liking - spicy! All in all I would whole heartedly recommend this place, especially after recent lacklustre experiences at similar restaurants. I'm looking at you Moxie's!"}
{"text":"Food are definitely delicious!!! the Service is a bit slow, but they are quite warm and friendly. We went for lunch on the roof top patio, if you are group smaller than 8, you won't be seated at the nice sofa table :( and the regular tables have chairs that are not so comfortable (hard to sit straight). But other than that, really nice ambiance consisted of nice decor and decent musics."}
{"text":"Love Cactus Club - AMAZING food, good drinks and decently priced. My only issue with this place is the ridiculous wait times for tables. They hardly take reservations and most of their tables are apparently mainly for walk-ins. Imagine having to wait after a long day at work just to be in a chain restaurant/earls setting.. not worth it in my opinion.   However I'd go to Cactus on a Friday night just for drinks on their deck because the vibe & music is good. BUT for afterwork drinks?  Nope I'd stick to another place - Lavelle, Porch, Kasa Moto etc... these are rooftop patios that actually take reservations LOL. Anyways, they're obviously doing something right because this place is always busy."}
{"text":"I've been there 3 times in the past and had a very good experience with the staff, service, and the food. However, my most recent visit was disappointing. Upon arrival (with no reservation), we were told the wait time was 30 minutes. We agreed to put our name on the waiting list for a table. Approximately 5-10 minutes later, we got a text message saying that our table was ready and were told that we would be seated in the rooftop. However, once we got there, we were given a \"late night menu\" which was less than half the size of the regular menu. When I asked the waitress, she said that this is the menu for the rooftop since apparently, they have a different kitchen. When I asked her if it would be possible to receive the normal menu, she said that we would have to wait again for a table on the bottom 2 levels.  What I don't understand is why we were not told that the menu would be different on the rooftop. If we were told this in advance, we would have requested to sit elsewhere. Another table across from us also had the same complaint to the waitress, but they were able to order food from the regular menu and had it brought up to the rooftop.  All in all, the food was good and the ambiance was nice. However, after coming here so many times, I find the place to be very hyped up for what it is especially considering the service we received."}
{"text":"So I finally got the chance to go on the third floor after waiting for so long and it surely didn't disappoint. Although it's not summer yet so the retractable roof wasn't in use, I really loved the whole vibe of the third floor--loud music, open bar, lots of seating, and just an overall modern feel to it. I wish I took pictures because it's just such a pretty sight to look at. The Brazilian drink is definitely a must try! I'm typically a mojito girl so I was a bit disappointed when their mojito sucked but I tried the Brazilian drink and it was amazing and even had pieces of kiwi floating in it.  I'll definitely be back and I can't wait to come back when it's warm outside!"}
{"text":"This is the worst place for service.   Came here last night with some friends for dinner. Gave our name to the hostess for a table. She said it would be approx 30 min wait, no problem. She said we could hang out on the 2nd flr bar and the 3rd flr bar would open at 8 pm.   We went upstairs to the 3rd flr at 8, and the hostess there told us that all tables upstairs are reserved and that we should go back downstairs.....anyhow, we got a msg at that time that there was a table for us so we trekked all the way back down to get our table. Well, when we got to our table some other people had sat down so we weren't allowed to have the table. The hostess told us we could either be out back on the wait list again or go back upstairs and have a seat at one of the reserved tables but would have to leave at 9:30 as that was when the guests had booked for. Seriously? How rude. Another hostess said we should sit first and then they would try to get us another table when the time came.   Well, 9:30 pm came, and this time a male host came over and in a very rude and defensive voice told us that we had to pay the bill and leave now because we stole someone else's reserved table and sat down without permission. WTF? My husband explained how his colleagues gave away our table and sat us here and he said we still have to leave. WOW... so honourable. You let someone else sit at our table and kick us out bc someone else booked a table.  What about us? Why didn't they do something about it.   Seriously, you're in the restaurant business. I get that it's a large establishment and stuff happens, but you work around it and find us a seat instead of being so rude and offensive. We are paying guests too, so why are we getting he short end of the stick because your staff doesn't care and know how to treat their guests with respect.   Sure, they're busy and make lots of money, and probably don't care if they piss off one table but I am never coming here again."}
{"text":"It's nothing special or over-the-top. Would have been 3 stars, but the fact that we lost our reservation due to the staff's inability to manage seating arrangements. We were told we would receive a text message that our spot would have been available - yet we did not receive one and our spot was given away immediately. We ended up being seated at the bar for an hour into the service, before we were seated to a table.  Waitresses were nice for the most part, but not very attentive - came once to quickly drop off menus, to take orders, drop off food and clear out the plates. When it came to tipping, I gave what I thought was modest and standard (15%) despite the earlier mix-up, but received a dirty look for the staff nonetheless. Not impressed.  If I could have, I would've just left upon arrival and went onto somewhere a bit more pleasant, like OB's just down the street. Not expecting to return anytime soon."}
{"text":"This particular location is always extremely busy,   make your rsvp's - I think it's busiest Cactus Club in Calgary.   This one location has never missed with our meals.  Served quite fast and to perfection.  It's one of our favorite restaurants in Calgary.  Have to Add... Alma,   one of the team leaders ...  I'd return ... just for her service.  She welcomes people and deals with any issues.  She dealt with my issue within minutes and then came back to make sure we were happy... who does that?  Not many...she's going to climb up the ladder of that company pretty fast, or they are missing out on a rare individual who deals and solves problems with ease and charm and follows up.   She's so amazing at what she does,  I would hire her (that is the truest compliment). She's 5 star!!   And, shout out to Stacy Cramer... we were compelled to tip over 30%.   She truly cares that you get exactly what you want... and fast.  Any special requests are never forgotten.  When she brings your meal it's served hot and to perfection. She is not ... a  \" how can I help you\" while thinking of a million other things.. kinda person.  She's present, she really really listens and cares that your happy with the food. Not the first time she has had us in her section.  She is a very \"real\" and caring person, she has integrity and really wants you to be happy.   My only complaint... how could this Cactus not have meat balls on their menu?   It's one of the tastiest most delicious melt in your mouth starters. When someone ( last year)  at our table ordered meat balls as a starter I was perplexed trying to sway them to something else.  They wouldn't budge.  I tasted what I thought was an insane choice... was I ever wrong.  It's the only place I've ever seen \"just\"  meat balls on the menu ... as a starter.. they taste so amazing.  Why not have them at this particular Cactus???  Anyone listening??   So ... Big huge \"Bravo\"  to Alma and Stacy for their service in different area's, the ones that make people come back- again and again!! It's the caring ways of true professionals. Huge shout out to Curtis.. manager who was promoted long ago as district manager - well deserved...who moves around between restaurants.  He also tries and always succeeds in helping, he's amazing!! I never ever see line ups at the downtown Cactus Club anymore...  now we only go to the others,  maybe they need Alma and Stacy to help them regain their clients...."}
{"text":"Very spacious cactus club. When you're in a Friday night and if you're going for special occasion or with bunch of people, I would recommend you make reservations. We just went to the bar and there's enough standing space. The top floor is nice as it's open rooftop in the summers and in the winters it's closed but they still keep it open with the roof and heaters. Busy spot. Didn't have food but I'm sure it's pretty decent"}
{"text":"More of a 3.5 - my friends and I were looking for a restaurant along the PATH to catch up and we thought that this place had the best mix of Joey's/Jack Astors. Thankfully my friend made reservations for us for 5:30 because it was PACKED. I can see why some reviewers said that their wait was 2+ hours. The first thing I noticed was the sign that said proper attire only (this is the middle of the financial district so I guess they want business casual). Also, the waitresses had skin-tight dresses on - definitely a more upscale sports bar vibe.  We were seated at a booth where we sat in a semi-circle position. It was so loud that the 2 people sitting on the opposite ends couldn't hear each other. We had to yell or repeat our sentences more than once, and it was just 4 of us! Also, despite a few lights near the bar and a candle at your table, you're practically eating in the dark. I could barely even see what I was reading, and when I was using the machine to pay at the end of the night - I couldn't see the numbers to punch in my pin.  We began our night by sharing the truffle fries ($9.50), which were quite good with the chipotle mayo dip. Our waitress was very nice and attentive, but I thought we would each get small plates since we were sharing an appetizer. Instead, we all clamoured over each other's arms to get to the bowl. I ordered the cajun chicken burger ($16) - simple and mildly spicy. For $16 though, I wish it came with more toppings than just lettuce and cheese. It did come with fries that were insanely salty. My lips are still trying to heal from how salty it was. My friend who also ordered a burger with fries said her fries were salty too. My other friend ordered a salad and said she enjoyed the chicken, but found that there was too much romaine lettuce in ratio to the other ingredients.  Overall, service was fast and friendly and food was filling. I wouldn't make this my restaurant of choice, but I can see why people enjoy it here."}
{"text":"So, in Calgary for work, not sure of where to go. This place, next to an A&W, looked like a normal restaurant/bar, looked like every other mid-market establishment. That is definitely not the case.  Started with the honey lager (very good, light) and an app of szechuan chicken lettuce wraps. Excellent. Sweet and spicy, but not too much.  For the entree, upon the recommendation of the waitress, got the fish tacos. Also very, very good. Fish tasted fresh, the salsa/cabbage was not at all overpowering. Seriously and unexpectedly good.  I have to give a compliment to the staff, probably the prettiest women in black dresses I've seen outside of the village in NYC I've seen in a while."}
{"text":"I am usually very skeptical about chain restaurants. Decided, however, to give this one a try based on reviews. We tried one of the other locations for dinner, but were told there would be a two-hour wait! We tried this location for lunch the next weekend, and it was easy to get a table. I was more than impressed with the food! We tried the tuna stack which was simply awesome. I would go so far as to say, it was one of the best appetizer dishes I have had in a long long time. The Thai Lingcod was very good as well.   If it were not for their silly reservations policy, I would give it 5 stars. Apparently, they keep only a few tables that can be reserved, while most tables are for walk-in customers. This results in a severe increase in the wait times."}
{"text":"Came here once on a Friday night with some gals, and had a lovely experience. We started off with drinks while the waitress got our seats ready. I ordered the butternut squash ravioli and it was very delicious. Price is on the fairly expensive side, so it is a treat to come here. Overall customer service was great, and the choice of music was bombbb that night.   They always checked up on us and the drinks. We ordered tequila shots as well. Definitely recommend the truffle cheese fries as well!"}
{"text":"Went to Cactus Club for the first time for dinner last night. We didn't have reservations, however the wait to sit on the rooftop patio was only 10-15 minutes on a Saturday night. The ambiance of both outdoor and indoor seating was really nice, the rooftop had lights above you, a DJ spinning tracks and table candles. I recommend this place for groups or date night. My boyfriend and I ordered Baja Fish tacos to share for our appetizer, it was really delicious! For dinner I ordered a Chicken salad, and he ordered the Cajun Chicken Sandwich that came with a kale salad - he loved his meal. The service was pleasant too. Overall it was a nice experience, I would definitely go back for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"An amazing place with great food and terrific atmosphere!  Perfect service! Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Really disapointing. I've been to the Cactus Club in Kelowna a few times and the food was delicious and the service was quick and attentive. I sat at the bar here attempting - emphasis - to order drinks and apps... but the bartenders were extremely slow and my beer (and friends beers) were constantly empty. We sat staring at the bartenders waiting for their attention. Often they were just chatting with one another. I don't think I will return here for a while."}
{"text":"Very pricey for mediocre food. Nice atmosphere, but it didn't make up for overcooked tuna sandwich and overly oily soup. I will admit, we may have ordered the wrong thing. If I ever was convinced to go there again I'd have a Burger and ribs...but I wouldn't go back easily."}
{"text":"we had a fantastic meal! the service was prompt, friendly, and knowledgable. the food was prepared as requested, came out swiftly and hot. desserts were delightful, too. definitely will return next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"I classify Cactus Club in the same restaurant category as Joeys/Earls/etc. Good generic menu to please a crowd with slightly upscale prices and attractive waitresses in short skirts.   On a recent late lunch with co-workers, I tried the duck clubhouse. This sandwich is comprised of duck, chicken, and pancetta on fruit bread. The resulting flavour profile is a delightful blend of sweet and salty.   While everything was fine, I'm only rating the restaurant three stars as it doesn't really offer anything to distinguish it from the multitude of similar restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"This is a trendy spot with a roof top patio/bar they call the deck. We went on a Friday evening, music was banging old school hip hop which we enjoyed. Wait time for a table wasn't too bad but you're encouraged to drink and mingle while you wait. We were a table of 10, seated quickly enough. Food was good, rates were fair, service was great and the set up was large enough to be comfortable yet equally intimate. Great starting point for a night of fun."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch and never been before. Right away, the server seemed very snobby. I couldn't keep her attention if my life depended on it. I literally told her my order and she wouldn't even look at me and made me repeat it over again. After that, she barely checked in on us and if she did, she had major attitude. I'm a very friendly person and gave off a friendly vibe so it doesn't make sense. It definitely ruined my dining experience and I won't be going back. I don't remember the server's name but she was working around 3 or 4pm on the patio last Saturday. She had long dark hair and wore glasses."}
{"text":"I thought I was going to rate this place 5/5. I really did.  Until the last moments of me being here.   We came on a Wednesday at 4pm and it was packed af. We chilled at the bar, drank the daily special - it was a longboard lager that was crisp and delicious. And we waited for a table - a table that was already open since we got there and we were told we'd be kicked out at 6:15 because that's when the reservation was. We were 2, waiting for 5-6 others to join us so we chilled, ate calamari, truffle fries etc. It was happy hour and we split! Truffle fries were the BEST EVER. They are legit one of my favourite foods. It was only $3 during happy hour (2-5pm?) SO BOMB.   When the rest of the girls came, we ordered one of those large sangria 'kegs' for $65 - a pretty sweet deal! We shared the keg, ordered more food amongst us and few more drinks. We were spending dolla dollar tonight! Everything was great, service was great - very smiley and helpful, especially when our sangria keg kept getting jammed with strawberries.   The bad stuff starts happening.. My friend asked for a beer 3 times and it didn't come for at least 40 minutes.  The first girl I was here with had to leave early so she paid half of what her and I shared (we actually had the exact same thing - two beers, a split percentage of the sangria, half calamari and half fries) Her bill came up to $37 when she left.  When we all asked for the bill, it took about forever and a day to arrive. It was messed up the first time. Then I went to the back of the bill and wrote it out for her so she can split it easily - I've done this for many restaurants and I make it very simple. Write out numbers (numbers of bills that need separation) and what each person had under each number. She messed it up again and gave this one girl who barely ate anything a $70 bill and this other girl who had one truffle fries order a bill that said 'half a truffle fries' ... then my bill was messed. Remember when I said I had the same order as my friend? How did my total come to $50+??? So I saw that she charged me the full thing for what my friend paid half for already AND an extra truffle fries on my bill. When I told her, her attitude went 100 to 0. She was so annoyed, rolled her eyes, clicked her teeth and said \"well you guys had a lot of stuff\" ..soo???? Isn't that what your restaurant wants?? Business??? And isn't that your job??? I was so annoyed. I had to go catch the train and realized we asked for the bill at 7:10 and we were still settling it at 7:37...I paid the extra $ just because I had to leave. I even still tipped the 15% but she was so peeved at us that she didn't say a word when all of us were paying; we all tipped and not one 'thank you'. At the end when we left, all she said was \"sorry for the confusion\" ...bye.  I loved the atmosphere (seriously feels like miami on the rooftop), the food but that service and the scamminess was unacceptable. My boss hates this place too because apparently they just charge whatever they want on the bill because usually everything gets expensed so people don't even look at the bill before paying."}
{"text":"Speaking as somebody who actually used to work there (granted, only for about 2 months) and has eaten there several times, I have seen pretty much every aspect of Cactus Club there is to see, and I have a lot of praises to sing.  I'm struggling with how to sum up the atmosphere and feeling of this place. It's not quite the sort of \"fine dining\" establishment that comes with dress codes... but it's also not your neighborhood joint where (at least I) would feel right sitting there in an old t-shirt and my favorite pair of jeans. This is very much a spot where I could see taking a date for dinner - nothing too formal, but \"nice\". It strikes a pretty good balance, and definitely has it's own style to it. (A note: the cool thing about Cactus Club out here is that the chain has A LOT of locations out in, say, Vancouver, but they're few and far between enough out here that a lot of people have never been there - so I've found it pretty useful if you want to introduce people to something a little bit new).  The food is also of the same sort of caliber. It's not exactly the pretentious sort of menu where you need a masters degree in foreign languages to properly pronounce things, and you never really know what you're putting in your mouth - but the burgers, for example, aren't the typical \"ketchup, mustard and the usual fixings\" type deals either. Most of the menu is something fairly common with the Cactus' own twist on it. I was always especially a fan of the Cajun Chicken sandwich or the Jack Daniels BBQ Burger. And OH... MY... GOD their dessert menu is amazing. Not one bad thing to be had there. Don't miss it. It's been a while since I've been there but if they still offer the desert sampler, go for it. It's smaller versions of 3 of their most popular desserts, complete with the chef's recommendation of the order in which to try them to maximize the flavor. It's just enough to share between a couple people and try a few more things, without actually having to order 3 desserts. The Key Lime Pie is also outstanding - and is all made from scratch right there on location (right from juicing their own limes... trust me, I've done it.)  My favorite part of the Cactus Club experience, though, is always the staff. While CC likes to pride itself on having \"Canada's first Iron Chef\" as the executive chef in their test kitchen who \"designs\" the chains signature dishes, the menus vary between locations, and those variances are due to their in-house chefs, and (while I can't say for sure if he's still there, though I imagine he is) the chef I worked under at this location was nothing short of remarkable, and the rest of the kitchen work their fingers to the bone to stay up to that standard. I've never seen such efficient, consistent and quality work in a kitchen (and I worked in several back in that point of my life). This is one of the VERY few restaurants where what you see in pictures is actually what comes to your table. As for the wait staff, it seems to be a given nowadays that servers in this type of restaurant are staggeringly photogenic and grinning from ear to ear. This location is no different. I've never seen a bad service - nor a server that looked anything short of stepping out of a magazine. It's very pleasent, if almost a bit (humorously) depressing to think that some of us aren't even attractive enough to carry plates to a table.  The downside, of course (as is usually the case) is the price list. Unfortunately, you get what you pay for so a very stylish place with great food, amazing staff and a charming atmosphere commands a pretty penny, and for someone like me with very traditional tastes, a lot of the menu may seem very adventurous (a nice way of saying a bit scary) with some of the bold choices CC makes. It's definitely not meant to cater to the \"average joe\" just going out to grab a bite with his buddies. But if you have a date you want to wine and dine, a business dinner, or some other meal with which you hope to impress, it's hard to do a lot better.  (#1/100 of the Yelp 100 challenge!)"}
{"text":"Good news. Bad news. The good news is it has great atmosphere, decor, food and service. The bad news is that the target market is 20, 30 and I will even give you 40 year olds. Anyone over that age will not appreciate the music which is blasted at at ear splitting level such that you have to scream in order to try and talk to the person next to you or across from where you are seated. We had a great meal but left to have drinks somewhere else where we could actually carry on a conversation with each other. The place was packed with young professionals so obviously the deafening level the music is played at is not an issue with a certain demographic."}
{"text":"Great service, great drinks, food decent (maybe better than expected for chain!). Had a very good steak and decent martini. Service was attentive and fun, and good vibe and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I have been here so many times that when I sat down and looked at the menu yesterday I wanted to try something on the menu that I hadn't tried before and that was hard for me as I have tried almost everything on the menu.  Everything from the modern bowl with all the different additions you can add to it such as salmon, tuna, chicken, etc.  The butternut squash ravioli with prawns is my favourite and I have had that both in the meal size and in the starter size. The tuna stack is also delicious for a starter. I have had the salmon dijon for a main meal.  My favourite drink on the menu was called a frose or a rosini as I like to call it. Well that was there summer drink so now they have a new one in replace of it called the blackberry harvest or something along those lines which is just as amazing and good. Highly recommend it.  So to find something I hadn't tried for a main meal yet- I got the short rib sandwich and my boyfriend got the Rob's Chicken sandwich and both were amazing. My waitress suggested that I don't get the short rib sandwich as she didn't like it but I am glad I did because I loved it. Yes she was right that it could have used more flavour like a BBQ sauce or something but there was cheese and it was served on sourdough so it was great. Also, it was like a beef dip because you dipped it in beef au jus. I won't be getting this again because I have a rule when I go to a restaurant to get something different overtime and my boyfriends chicken sandwich was better than the short rib sandwich.  The only thing I did not like about the restaurant and what I thought was weird was that they started vacuuming the carpet while we were eating. Yes I understand that they were cleaning but it was loud and that place is half carpet. I think they should just do it at the end of the day.  because I have eaten so much from here, I have decided to write a full list of everything on the menu (past and present) that I have tried under every category on the menu and whether I recommend it or not. Updated at the beginning of February 2018:   Drinks (Cocktails)- I have had almost every cocktail on the menu but none of the wines or beers:  - Passion Fruit Bellini- RECOMMEND but tastes like a peach bellini with a gooseberry in it and it is seasonal  - The Belinni- RECOMMEND - Whiskey Giner Smash- Recommend but the ginger is strong  - The Brazilian- RECOMMEND this is my favourite drink  - Signature Cesar- Recommend but it is typical - Signature Sangria- Recommend but it is a typical drink - Nothing but Pink- RECOMMEND - Flirtini- RECOMMEND - Frose: RECOMMEND but it is seasonal  - Rosini: RECOMMEND but it is seasonal  - Blackberry Harvest: RECOMMEND but it is seasonal   Start and Share: - Szechuan Chicken Lettuce Wraps- RECOMMEND - Tuna Stack- Recommend BUT its becoming popular everywhere  - Edamame- Don't recommend as it is too typical  - Ceviche- Don't Recommend - Ravioli and Prawn Trio- RECOMMEND - Calamari- Recommend but its nothing special  - Beef Carpaccio- RECOMMEND   Steaks -   Mains - Butternut Squash Ravioli with Prawns- Recommend but only in the Start and Share size  -   Fresh Greens - Modern Bowl with grilled Avacado- RECOMMEND -Modern Bowl with Grilled Chicken- Don't recommend - Modern Bowl with Grilled Salmon- RECOMMEND -  Burgers and Sandwiches: - Cajun Chicken Sandwich- RECOMMEND - Rob's Crispy Chicken Sandwich- RECOMMEND - Short Rib Sandwich- Recommend but I don't think it is on the menu anymore -   Casual (I have had and recommend everything in this section): - Chicken Tacos- RECOMMEND - Baja Fish Tacos- RECOMMEND - Teriyaki Chicken Rice Bowl- RECOMMEND - Chicken Tenders- RECOMMEND - Jambalaya Rice Bowl- RECOMMEND -  Desserts (I have had and recommend everything in this section especially the Key Lime Pie):  -  Chocolate Peanut Butter Crunch Bar- RECOMMEND - Caramel Chocolate Mousse- RECOMMEND - White Chocolate Cheesecake- RECOMMEND - Key Lime Pie- RECOMMEND - Chocolate Lava Cake- RECOMMEND"}
{"text":"Was quite excited to try this place after hearing many great reviews from people. We had a group of roughly 14 people and we decided to try a variety of appetizers and entrees. We ordered the Tuna Stack, Ravioli + Prawn Trio and the Mini Burgers. Simply loved all the appetizers. The Tuna Stack was nicely presented and was quite flavorful. The mini burgers were simply delicious with the added red pepper relish sauce. My friend recommended me to order the Hunter Chicken. The Chicken was so moist, succulent and was cooked to perfection. The portions size for this dish was a good amount and I could have eaten 5 more of these dishes. It was just that good. Definitely one of the best chicken dishes I've had. The staff were super friendly and customer service is what they really strive for. Another highlight of the night was when I got the chance to meet the Executive Chef Rob Feenie. Overall, great place to eat after a workday or simply hanging out with friends for a nice dinner meal."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night.  It was really busy but service was good.  The food here was pretty good but my friend's steak was over cooked.  Decor was nice but a bit annoying having to walk up three flights of stairs to get to your table.  I guess I shouldn't complain about a bit of exercise.   The only thing that annoyed me was that they gradually increased the volume of the music as the night went by to the point where it felt more like a club than a restaurant.  I couldn't even hear the person sitting next to me.  I suppose that's what they are aiming for but I left with a headache."}
{"text":"I had no complaints. Service was excellent. Great ambiance. I had the butternut squash ravioli and it was amazing! I tried some of my boyfriend's steak as well and let me tell you - this was steak done right! Not only was it the perfect medium rare, but it was also very tender and juicy. The calamari was the best calamari I've had - there was so much of it and the best part of all was that it wasn't dripping in grease like how a lot of calamaris are. I would love to come back again!"}
{"text":"My first review! The staff here have the trifecta: pretty, prompt and petite. My three favourite p's.   I got the Szechuan salmon bowl- delicious. Salmon was fresh, good serving size. Had a nice bite to it.   Their menu has some awesome options, a mix of burgers/sandwiches, steaks, salmon/chicken bowls.. It was a toss up between the chicken teriyaki bowl, fish taco's, \"the burger\" which was amazing looking, and the salmon bowl.   Pricing 14-35 for entrees and getting up there for steaks.   Games were on and it's busy on a Saturday, loud environment which I like."}
{"text":"I love their tuna tatatki and their butternut squash ravioli! My bf loves their Moscow mule drink and the steak is pretty good too. We go here for date nights once in awhile."}
{"text":"Its still very new so the rating could go up as the kinks get iromlned out.  Decent cocktail list, craft beers and wine. One wine by thd glass didn't come with it's \"extra\" which was broght with the second glass.    Service was earnest and ment well but still uninformed about some menu items.  And right now there ard sooo many server's its literally hard to get past the gang of them to get to the washrooms!  (Which had a lot of glasses by the sinks)  Food portions are about what you would expect. Two apps a shared main and dessert will still leave you peckish...  Tuna stack was tasty lots of flavour the crisps were nice and the avocado was nice and tasty addition.   The prawn squash ravoli was smooth textured amd light.   The short rib dish split in the kitchen was elegant and tasty. The lamb a friend ordered looked amazing!  Molten chocolate cake was well prepared  (which is kinda like saying by this point they had forks this isn't an original dessert choice lol)  Overall fun be seen scene but not sure a 6 top booth allows them to deliver the service they want...theres a lot of passing down and up dishes by guests."}
{"text":"Came for Winterlicious and absolutely loved the food, ambiance, and decor! Service was not bad and the portions are generous. I ordered the ravioli, modern bowl with salmon, the chocolate peanut butter crunch and their signature sangria (drink not included in winterlicious price). I enjoyed all the food very much and was very satisfied by the end of the meal."}
{"text":"I went there for a late lunch with my beau because we were in a rush and it was the first thing we saw. Our first impression is that it is another in that genre trying to that lounge-sort \"supper club\" kind of place, like I am watching some lame B-list movie about Vegas: nice interior, hostesses in tight cocktail dresses, and a floor manager that for some reason has an ear-piece like an FBI agent.   We went through the menu and it was grossly overpriced. Sorry, but I pay the same prices or less for a proper kitchen. That said, if you're of the sort that thinks something like Moxie's or Baton Rouge is a magical night out, then yeah, this is right up your alley.  All that said, we settled for a couple of craft pints and a few items off the happy hour menu -- and this is what redeemed it all. $3 per crispy chicken sammy, slider, fish taco, or truffle fries. But of course it arrived after quite a wait and was lukewarm. Despite the slow pace of the service, our waitress was quite sweet."}
{"text":"Getting a reservation can be hard if you don't do it in advance and I'm not sure it's ultimately worth they hype, but I enjoyed it and would return.   We tried a few dishes:  Lettuce wraps - nothing exciting, but tasty. I loved the spicy yogurt sauce and hot sauce served on the side.   Flatbread - again, pretty standard. Not mind blowing.   Rain coast salad - delicious. Loved the avocado and spicy pecans. Dressing was boring though.  Sweet potato fries. Really good. But what does that say when I leave thinking that the sweet potatoes was one of the best dishes I had?  The ravioli. OMG. So insanely good. Life changing maybe. The truffle butter sauce was to die for.   Go there for the ravioli. Worth it.  Like I said, I will go back. The menu is promising.  I don't think we ordered anything exciting, but it was all pretty tasty."}
{"text":"Came here for work lunch on a Tuesday and we sat upstairs - it gets pretty busy and we waited a couple minutes before a table was available. Restaurant has a really nice environment and great service. We ordered the Baja fish tacos and the Raincoast Greens salad. I enjoyed my salad - greens were fresh and the chicken was tender. Baja fish tacos were just alright. Will come back to try other items on their menu!"}
{"text":"Every time I've gone to Cactus Club, no matter the location, the food has been great. The butternut squash ravioli starter/entree is amazing! Gave the creole steak & prawns a try, I was very impressed. Service was great, no complaints what so ever. If you're looking for consistently awesome food, Cactus Club does the job!"}
{"text":"Love it here! I've been here twice both times on the third level party space (not sure what the proper name is but it's definitely a cool floor to be on)! The waitresses are nice and accommodating and the service is very prompt. I'm surprised at the food and efficiency of this restaurant. They've maximized their restaurant space, seriously there's no space to walk around yet you never have to wait long for anything. That's definitely something to applaud! Our drinks and entrees are hot fired to us which is awesome. I think we waited 6 minutes for drinks and maybe 15 minutes for our food? Which is incredible to me I don't know how they do it! I had the Brazilian which is a little sweet but still really refreshing. I can taste the kiwi flavour in the cocktail very nicely. My friends and I shared the truffle fries, calamari, tuna tartare, and beef sliders. Everything was tasty and my favourite might have to be the beef sliders, so you should definitely order that. 3 come in a portion but they were able to accommodate us and allow us to order 4! Restaurant is beautiful and there's lots of people watching as well!"}
{"text":"Popped in here for the first time after finding out Toronto had a Cactus Club. All of the staff are amazing and genuine with no attitude. It's refreshing to go to a restaurant/ bar that has great atmosphere, good food and drinks, and staff that are nothing but accommodating to your needs.  I was meeting a friend for drinks and a bite and had time to kill so sat at the bar for a drink while putting my name on the wait list for a table. They were able to get me a booth on the second level within ten minutes of arriving - super fast. Both waitresses at the bar and booth were super friendly and not fake. Another member of staff stopped by to ask if everything was alright because I was alone waiting and I mentioned I wanted to go up to the rooftop with the live DJ. He said no problem and got my friend and I table space up on third level.   Loved the music. Loved the staff and loved the vibe in Cactus Club. Couldn't recommend it enough."}
{"text":"Friday night, 6:30-ish dinner. First, \"the good\": I wish I could remember our servers name, because she was lovely! (We were the weirdos who wanted to taste a corked wine!) She was friendly and accommodating under what appeared to be a stressful work environment (more on that shortly). And the food was delicious! I had the ravioli app and the short ribs - excellent. My friends enjoyed their dinners as well.   Okay, so the \"not so good\": the atmosphere could best be described as Aggressive. It was loud and crowded, the hosts station was terribly disorganized, and restaurant staff were all over the place - hovering around the stairs for some reason, always in clusters and shouting over each other. No one seemed to really know where they were supposed to be or what they should be doing. This was surprising in a place that advertises as being a higher end place with dress codes and an \"image\". It was as though \"the kids\" were running around unsupervised. Usually in a high end place more effort is made to take care of the comfort of the patrons, but everyone was too frantic for much of that - except for our server, of course. There was a thin bearded man with a headset racing around like an emotionless robot. One time he raced past our table and bumped into our server as she was taking our order and he didn't even slow down never mind apologize to her. He filled our water glasses a few times without acknowledging us at all - he was very fast about it though, which was good since we didn't really want him there. Quite rude. A coat check or something would have been nice. There were racks scattered around, but nothing near us.   Thanks to our fantastic server and the delicious food, we had a nice dinner. But the rest of the experience wasn't great. We probably won't go back, and I wouldn't recommend it to my friends. If you're over 35, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I ordered the Jambalaya Rice Bowl and found it to be just okay. I also didn't appreciate not being told that to choose Quinoa as my rice option would cost me another $2."}
{"text":"The sliders were nic3 little burgers... the lettuce was like a rag thiugh and the tomatoe was like rope.  I had the tenderloin and it was cooked nicely.  All around it was a good experience and the food was actually cooked properly.  I always say that there is a reason some stores become chains and huge enterprises, and its because they can make a great end product."}
{"text":"We came here for a work lunch last week, the location is great, the restaurant is nicely decorated, we sat on the deck which is a great summer spot. The staff was attentive and helpful, no complaints there. They did have an obscene minimum spend for lunch for 14 people, and if you do not reach it they charge you the remainder as a room fee. The truffle fries were very good, but it is not hard to get that right. I ordered the modern bowl as my main and it was kind of a let down. It really was not inventive, just a LOT of rice, random vegetables, an avocado with the peel still on and some salsa and sauce. Honestly it was like that meal you make when you have too many vegetables  about to go bad so you need to just throw it all together. Things did not really complement each other well and it was bland. They need to take a note from places like Lee where the flavours pop but play well with others. The saving grace was the dessert, i had the pumkin pie cheesecake, it was fabulous, flavourful but not overly sweet. Others said that their desserts were also top notch.  My lasting impression is that this place is a bit snobby but does not have the goods to back it up. I would much rather go to a lower end restaurant with flavourful food then come here, and I would not want to bring a visitor here as their culinary experience of Toronto. Good for team lunches? Sure, just make sure they spend the minimum amount so you're not leaving money on the floor."}
{"text":"Amazing place! Had an awesome time with my girl Friends. Food was excellent. There are 3 different bars and all floors has a good section of music playing. Will definitely go back here."}
{"text":"Always seems to be busy, great vibes, decent wine list. Somehow even on weekday evenings it draws huge crowds. Whether you're out with work people, friends or on a date it's got you covered.  Highly recommend the four mushroom steak! Superbly done steak, flavorful sauce and heavenly whipped potatoes. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the quality of the food and service! Music and atmosphere is amazing!"}
{"text":"Came by for a Happy Hour drink, hoping to finding a seat on the roof because it was such a beautiful TO afternoon. Unfortunately, the place was SLAMMED but we were able to find a seat at one of the inside bars. This is definitely a place to see and be seen. Go for the frose, it's delicious!"}
{"text":"Update regarding tonight service (Monday 19th Feb) special thank you to Neil (manager). Great"}
{"text":"So I had my holiday dinner here last week with a group of 9 friends. A girls night if you will.   I would give this place 3.5 stars if I could but Yelp doesn't do partial. Loss of stars because of customer service. Kind of disappointed by the difficult reservation process and service my friends and I experienced this time. A real shame because I really loved my first visit. Maybe it was just due to the holidays and they are still adjusting/training people?    Anyways, I went to the restaurant to inquire about group bookings a few weeks ago since I was in the area. They don't take phone reservations for groups of more than 8 people. One of the staff wrote down the email I was to contact, which ended up being wrong. Granted, this was corrected and then forwarded to the right person. However, I was then given a PDF file to fill out for group bookings. Okkkay. Except beware the non-refundable $500 deposit charged if you decide to cancel within 72 hrs of reservation. They also charge 18% tip for groups too, but that's the norm. For cancellation deposit though, I just don't like having a policy like that over my head that allows little leeway. I've been to many high end dining restaurants and I have to say, this is the first I've seen such a high $$ charge for cancellation policy. Even my friends were shocked by it.   Now, back to the form. Filling the form online is difficult, since you also have to sign it. Meaning, I have to print out the form, fill in info, scan and email it to myself. From there, I forward it to the booking rep with details about what floor I want it to be on (I chose rooftop). I should be done right? Nope. I have to then call the restaurant for a booking confirmation number and provide my credit card info again. No manager was available when I first called so I called back next day, still busy but an employee takes down my credit info. They said they would send a confirmation email in a few days. Days later, still no email. Have to call AGAIN. They said I will be getting a call soon. Next day, finally got a call confirming my booking and then they claimed they sent me a confirmation email. Not the case. So they sent it again but with wrong floor I want to dine at. T_T After I sent yet another email, reservation is finally fixed.   Day of, apparently some of my friends came a bit early before our dinner time and asked about my reservation. Only to get the run around from hostess that they don't see my reservation on their list. My friend told me she saw it on the hostess screen and had to point it out multiple times until they finally \"saw it.\" Idk, I missed experiencing that drama first hand. When we finally got seated, our server was nice and friendly, so no issues there.   In terms of atmosphere, it was much louder then I expected (had to shout when talking), plus they sat our table next to the DJ and near the bar. I don't know what was happening with the servers but they kept dropping a large amount of glasses that night. I think it happened like 2-3 times while I was dining.   For food, I tried the Cheddar Bacon Burger ($16.50). Its essentially the same as Feenie Burger ($18) without the sautéed mushrooms. A friend tried the Feenie and said she didn't like it much because bacon was too burnt? I had no issues with mine tho. Another friend tried the Butternut Squash Ravioli since she knew I liked it. I did tell her about the strong truffle smell and taste just incase but she didn't even notice the smell. Guess it depends on the individual. She really liked the dish as well.   For drinks, I had a large Signature Sangria ($10) ...but I think they forgot my peach shot? Still good tho. One of my friends ordered the Cesar because she is obsessed with them and she enjoyed her drink too. Everyone else in my group had the daily drink special (Bellini for $6).   Overall, they provide good food, reasonable prices, and great drinks. They just need to fix customer service, train employees more and find a more efficient booking process ASAP for me to continue recommending them. They could easily become my favourite spot if not for these issues. No customer likes to feel like they are jumping through hoops just to make a reservation. Atm, I would only come back for drinks and maybe dine during off times."}
{"text":"Overall very happy. But! I ordered duck confit (double confit). It was not a confit (meat slow cooked in it's own fat). Instead it was just a couple of overly salted, somewhat dried out legs.  The martini was too sweet. Could not taste the gin at all, even though it was the Tanguray 10. Waitress was great. Lettuce wraps appetizer was very good. Fish tacos were good too, although not a fan of their flour tortillas."}
{"text":"Pretty good atmosphere and food. The service is well above average, the only thing I would say is that the area is rather small and crowded on weekends but if you like that, this is a great place"}
{"text":"Food was really good, waitress as well. I enjoyed the atmosphere. It is very much like a Smith and Wolenski Grille area (noise wise.)  We went outside the door near the restaurant hostess section for air and so my colleague could get a smoke in between apps and dinner and the bouncer closed and looked the door in the 5 minutes we were out there.  (Big guy) with a beard.   When we walked up to open door, which glass and he could see us, it was locked.  We asked him to push handle open, he told Us to go around??  We explained we were in the middle of dinner and we came through that door and don't even know where around was.....  He told us he didn't care, go find the other door.  When I asked where, he just walked away mid sentence and was completely rude.   Is this a restaurant??? I thought.  If some of our party weren't still in there I would've left honestly..  I do a lot of bank work in Toronto. Won't be bringing my clients there anymore. We had a table for 6. Nice wine and a tab well over a 1000 and you treated us like that? We are in suits and 45 years old.  Obviously eating there.   I don't care how good the food is, not going to be treated like some club kid trying to get in studio 54 in 1980,  there's other places to eat in Toronto.  By the way. The door was down a bunch of steps to a door with another line a level below where we were eating.  So he could've taken 2 secs to push the handle. Instead he was rude and made us take a hike to get back to our dinner which was already waiting."}
{"text":"From what I could see cute decor it's pretty dark inside. The music was good it was mainly pop r&b and hip hop. The staff was friendly.   There was 4 of us we got truffle fries as a starter which was a decent portion and tasted delicious. For main course I got the modern bowl with salmon which was really good I just didn't tabouli salad. One of my friends tried the butternut squash shrimp ravioli it tasted good but the squash was a little on the sweet side. And another friend got the fish tacos that were so salty we had to send them back.   For dessert we tried the key lime pie which was tasty. I would recommend the Frosé as a drink!   One thing I will say is the foods took long to come and when we ordered desert that took pretty long to come as well."}
{"text":"I have always had a great experience here.  The staff is timely and friendly.  The drinks are on point!"}
{"text":"Amazing! We had the best dinner last night. Great company and excellent service! The appetizers were outstanding. We shared the lettuce wraps and calamari. Both were fabulous. I really liked the presentation and will definitely order the lettuce wraps again as I will the calamari. The beers were great and served very cold. The meals were fabulous and perfect. We actually ended up drinking a lot (aside from the drivers) and had such a great time. Pierre was our server and he was very professional and simply made the overall experience perfect. I look fwd to coming back soon and am now a huge fan of the Cactus Club. I have only wonderful things to say about this restaurant. It's very clean, the staff are professional and the service is impeccable. Again, our meals were outstanding! We look fwd to returning soon."}
{"text":"My server is a cow - period - this sucks when we get the pretentious one - I am not familiar with the night servers as I take clients here during the day - she is not going to serve me again - Chloe - sorry \"babe\" as you call us - not good enough"}
{"text":"After all the hype behind cactus club I finally had a chance to go. Once you walk in you receive a warm greeting from the hostess with a good view of the street. The price point is fair and doesn't break the bank. the food did have a great unique selection of foods but it does have an extensive option for people to choose from. So if you're trying to plan a dinner with guests with a variety of preferences this would be a good place and safe choice to take them.  A side note, usually when I go to the restaurants and I inform the server of my food allergies. I'm told a warning about the kitchen and that they can not make guarantees about food safety. But Cactus club actually had a manager bring out my meal who told me they took the precaution to eliminate cross contamination. Although my allergy is not that severe it was nice that the restaurant took the precautions for me."}
{"text":"Came in during happy hour (2-5pm) to have some drinks and food and everything was great! The service was superb. Fortunately, there weren't too many people today on the holiday so there were no line ups. During happy hour, there are starters/sharables that are $4 including the baja fish tacos, truffle fries, mini burger, mini chicken sandwhich. I ordered the first three and I was surprised at how good the fries were! They didn't have a bitter aftertaste like other fries and I am guessing its because they were fried in truffle oil? Either way, it was delicious. I also recommend getting the brazillian cocktail if your feeling for a citrus-y drink!"}
{"text":"The butternut squash ravioli is EVERYTHING! I get it every time.  Cactus club is pricey, classy, and Toronto's current hotspot. Be sure to make reservations if you can, otherwise, be prepared to wait!"}
{"text":"Great menu and drink selection. I enjoy the ambiance!  The chef here is really talented! They have put together a very eclectic menu to suit anyones taste! Service is always great. Usually a line at the door though, so be prepared to wait! Well worth it"}
{"text":"Good food nice people  Cajun chicken lunch is nice, I order it without the butter on top"}
{"text":"Casual Mid-range West Coast Chain  C$80 + Tip for two Accepts all major credit cards Saturday brunch for two with drinks and appetizers No wait Reservations recommended for peak periods Reviewed as local  This mid-range west coast Canadian chain is enjoying decent success on the east coast and this location is no exception. The menu and quality is generally pretty good and consistent which is exactly what the clientele comes for.  We came for brunch on a Saturday and it was a decent convenient meal.  We dearly missed bloody Caesars (not marys) during our time away, so that was our first request. Once we had settled in to our drinks, we ordered the calamari as a starter (which was not exactly a small portion, leaving me concerned if I had space for our mains). I had the BBQ duck clubhouse and the wife had the raincoast greens salad. Both were good.  Food was decent quality and the consistency we've come to expect from Cactus Club. Restaurant was near empty so service was good. We opted to come here for something simple and relatively uncomplicated which is exactly what we got. Didn't need a reservation for the off-peak meal and it was near our hotel. However, to be honest, one criteria was that it was one of the few decent places open near TO's fi-di (Bay and King) during the weekend as most restaurants close.  This place generally gets more popular during the week with the finance crowd in First Canadian Place with the banks near by for lunch and after work drinks."}
{"text":"Best happy hour in all of Canada. Great drink specials and a nice atmosphere for after work.  I had the best sandwich I've ever had in my life.  It was bbq duck with chicken and bacon and it was incredible.   It's a must try.  If you are flying in or out of Calgary this place is a must."}
{"text":"Great service,  food and ambiance. We came on a Saturday night at 8pm, it was busy but we were seated quickly. Our waiter was a wonderful help and took good care of us."}
{"text":"Came here based on online reviews (#7 restaurant in Calgary according to Trip Advisor). Arrived with my two teenage sons on a Tuesday at 7 PM. The place was happening, but we didn't have to wait too long to be seated. The servers and hostesses are all extremely attractive young women. So much so that this middle aged mom from Hollywood noticed, so good for them!They were all pleasant but slllloooooowwww. I had the spaghettini with prawns. I don't mind salty food, but the sauce was incredibly salty. Like, the cook mistakenly dropped the entire salt shaker in the sauce and forgot about it salty. It was inedible. I don't know that I'd return, but the odds of that are pretty low anyway since we don't live in Canada. Looks like a great place for drinks after work though."}
{"text":"I really do enjoy Cactus Club, we come here quite often for date night. I usually only get the same thing (Chicken Pesto Quesadilla) but it's too good to not to get everytime. The Service is sometimes good, sometimes par but nothing to really complain about. I cannot wait for the one to open downtown."}
{"text":"Had a nice lunch at the Cactus Club. We started out with the lettuce wraps. They were quit good. Big chunky pieces of chicken. Plenty for 3 people. For the main course we had the spicy chicken sandwich. It was good, but not outstanding. The other dishes were the butternut squash ravioli topped with shrimp. Very good. The last dish was the pesto chicken quesadillas with cranberries. Really nice."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great vibe! My short rib pappardelle was one of the best I had, and I had some wonderful ones before. There were plenty of pork in the pasta which I like. My friend had the port wine salmon looked good and the portion was huge. Perfect place to have a dinner before going out at night"}
{"text":"This place is a popular meetup for the people working in the area, so it's a bit more pretentious than I prefer. I usually get a salad or vegetarian dish, and I've tried their other foods like their tuna tartare but it was always just mediocre. The Toronto food scene is way too vibrant and exciting for me to recommend this place for the food.  I'd only recommend this place if you want to meet some business clients or coworkers. There's something on the menu for everyone, as they're very conscious to be 'inclusive' of all these trendy food sensitivities/healthy lifestyles etc. It's got good service and nice ambiance for some light dinner and 'corporate social' event type thing. Remember to get a reservation!"}
{"text":"Went here because they have a rooftop patio. Doesn't have a view though which is what we'd have preferred. A view of anything but it has a roof system that blocks any view  The service here is great! We had Rachelle and she was so cute and friendly! We had the Tuna Stack appie and it was so delicious and refreshing! Highly recommend it!  For drinks we had Pilsner and the lager both pretty good but the Pilsner was a bit more refreshing in this hot day! The peach Bellini was also very good and strong in spirit if u like that which I certainly do!"}
{"text":"The house of yes. That's there motto and they sure do deliver  We started with the potato skins. They were the best I've ever had! The ratio of potato left on the skin and the toppings were perfect. Some places leave too much potato. The skin was crunchy and had some spices as well.   Then I shared a raincoast salad. I love this salad because the dressing is so light. And the spicy pecans are so good. If u like salad u have to try this one. It's pretty huge as well"}
{"text":"Decent place to have a dinner with a larger group. They're all kind of same around this area - earl's, kings tap, etc.   I would recommend this place if you want some decent food and need a place to hang old a large party for dinner downtown. Otherwise if you could have a potluck nearby, you'd probably have a better time and much more drinks/food. In addition, it got progressively louder from. 5pm to 8pm which MSD either hard for my parry and I to catch up.   For the food, it's a bit over priced ($18 for a burger?!) I got the Gardenburger. Great meal, I prefer veggie patties over the real thing just because  of the texture. At the small time, I know I can get the same thing else where. The other parties looks pretty small themselves or the parents just have to look after them.   Overall, I wouldn't come again with the same client/person, however definitely recommended for larger crlads/groups."}
{"text":"Cactus Club was really hyped up for months before I finally went there ... and I can't quite figure out why. the venue is nice - 3 floors, modern and a bit fancy.  It's completely packed with the financial/corporate crowd, and the staff is dressed for it, so expect pretentiousness.   That being said, service is quite nice (not super attentive if that's your thing), but they made opportunities to seat us quicker than expected. I like seeing the manager doing tasks like restocking glasses, etc.   The food was decent but not worth revisiting. Truffle fries delicious and perfectly crisped, and the staff were accommodating about not wanting cheese on the fries or food. I ordered the prawn ravioli and it was .... completely drowned out by the intense amount of butter. Okay but nothing special, unfortunately. Pumpkin cheesecake was delicious!"}
{"text":"Food was awesome, i do suggest burgers and chicken as well... the belini was great also"}
{"text":"A trendy Asian fusion restaurant with several locations around Canada. This location is close to the airport, providing easy access for out-of-town travelers. Expect a young and fashionable crowd, although we came in there casually dressed and didn't feel entirely out of place (it helped that we were sitting outside). If I lived in the area, I'm sure this would be a good spot for a date or a night out with friends. Maybe not the place I'll typically bring my parents. The menu offering consisted of traditional new American (or I guess, Canadian) dishes often with an Asian slant - such as the spicy sweet chili chicken, chicken lettuce wraps, and proteins with curry and hoisin sauces accompanied by shiitake mushrooms and rice. But there are also a spattering of southwestern/cajun dishes that steer away from the Asian and are a little more straightforward. To be honest, I find their menu a bit all over the place and would be nice if they stuck to a theme and perfected it, but who am I to say?   Regardless, food is fresh and well-seasoned. We tried a variety of starters and entrees, namely the spicy chicken, tuna tartare stack special, soy-dijon salmon, thai red curry pacific lingcod, and jambalaya rice bowl. While all food was well received, my favorites were the tuna tartare starter special and the soy-dijon salmon - given the flavor balance and the combination of ingredients. The spicy chicken tasted like a typical General Tso's chicken, and the Thai curry lingcod and jambalaya rice bowl tasted like they were somehow trying too hard to be unusual takes on classic dishes that somehow didn't resonate with my palate. But the price point was more than reasonable and made for a nice night out in Calgary.

{"text":"I usually really enjoy this place but my last visit I was disappointed.  My main problem was the food. I usually have one of 2 things on the menu and I ordered the duck club and the sandwich was loaded with the sauce so it fell apart the bread was not toasted and the duck was so chewy it wasn't good at all.  I was also expecting some thing more from my side of French frys but store bought frozen wasn't it.   The service was good the patio and drinks where great."}
{"text":"Great location and ambiance at Cactus Club.  The appetizers are great for sharing with drinks. My favourites are the Tuna Stack, the flat bread, and the lettuce wrap.   Service is also good, just plan ahead and reserve if you intend on going as it fills up fast."}
{"text":"Cactus club is certainly worth the hype especially after its feature in Torontolife magazine. However, it does seem like a more upscale version of Joey's. The menu focuses mainly on comfort food (sandwiches, pasta etc.). So, there's nothing particularly innovative but hey -- if it ain't broke, why fix it? The dishes are well portioned and very tasty!! Also extra brownie points for featuring delicious and affordable cocktails (e.g.: the faulty tower)!   The Szechuan chicken lettuce wraps, butternut squash ravioli with prawns and caramel chocolate mousse are must-haves!!   P.S: The playlist is soul food for the 90s child but it's so damn loud. It's hard to maintain a conversation without feeling like you're yelling!"}
{"text":"Our 'eager diners' group of 14 had a pleasant time at this restaurant for a Saturday lunch get-together. Our server was so sweet and enthusiastic and she was a real natural at ensuring that we were enjoying our time there. The other hosts and servers who came around to check on us and also provided hands to follow when our meals were ready were just as upbeat. The presentation on a lot of the dishes was skillfully applied, particularly on the appetizers. I didn't hear one person who tried their meal say anything bad about the taste of it, except to ooh and ah over their food during the first few bites. The Sangria for me had the right balance of alcohol to juice which suited me fine. I wasn't able to have a taste of the peachy-looking slush that came with it as it slowly dissolved into the drink. For my main I had the \"Rob's Crispy Chicken Sandwich\" and the sambal mayo complimented the crispy texture of the panko crust on the chicken breast. I had the Velvet Underground for dessert which was a chocolate mousse base, layer with some crunchy toffee sponge bits and a caramel foam in a shot glass. The flavors of each component went well with each other. The foam was sweet but also light and airy to the tongue, and I'm sure that a certain familiar brand of toffee crunchie was used for the toffee bits which was my absolute favorite and the mousse was also not heavy in texture. A very nice way to top off a filling meal. However, the stand-out dish was one of two complimentary appetizers that were surprisingly brought over. While both the Beef Carpaccio and the Ceviche had their own visual appeal and taste since both plates were polished off with enthusiasm, a few of people in my section of the table could not stop commenting on how fine the slices of beef were, and indeed to the point where it was so delicate that even gently trying to lift up a slice of beef with some tongs, the slice broke almost immediately. And the presentation on it was quite spot-on.  I didn't get to explore the interior properly but the lower floor had pretty cozy yet swank ambiance to it. I definitely liked looking at the display of flames going on in the patio area. I will definitely be raving to my acquaintances about this place and I hope to return sometime soon,"}
{"text":"Came here with my friend on a busy weekday, we sat at the bar area.  Service was great.  Drinks: THE BELLINI (4.5/5) (peach schnapps, champagne, bacardi white rum and sangria) I really liked this because it's sweet - no bitter alcohol taste (for light drinkers like me)! :D   Appetizers: * EDAMAME (steamed soybeans, sea salt)  * TRUFFLE FRIES (4/5) (truffle, herbs, grana padano, garlic aioli)  Loved the truffle fries! I've always loved the truffle flavour and the taste is quite strong in this dish. It was a big portion, great for sharing.  Mains: PAN ROASTED LINGCOD (4/5) (lingcod, roasted mushrooms, brioche croutons, pearl onions, truffle butter)  Similar to the truffle fries, I ordered this because of the \"truffle butter\" description to this meal. The display was very pretty, the fish was served in the middle of a big pot with ingredients spread out on the side. It was very filling!! I really enjoyed the fish - it was fresh and flavourful because it soaked in a lot of the sauce."}
{"text":"The Cactus Club Café is one of the very few franchise restaurants that consistently delivers an excellent dining experience. I think one of the reasons they've remained successful is by not expanding too quickly, and instead taking a controlled and balance approach to keep quality intact. Far too often I see the quality of chain restaurants diminish in a fast pursuit of a quick dollar, but the Cactus Club Café really has kept a focus on their food and service throughout their Journey. For those who don't know they actually took on Iron Chef Rob Feenie in 2008 as their executive chef and food concept architect, they then went on to add Top Chef Canada winner Matthew Stowe to their arsenal as a product development chef. The results are clear, as the quality of food is top notch for a chain restaurant!  On our most recent visit at the Macleod location there was even a feature menu for the Calgary Stampede, I was happy to try the feature burger which delivered a mouth watering experience that I passively filed in my brain's \"Top 10 Burger\" department. My fiancée had a burger off their regular menu and echoed the same satisfaction I did. Their menu is comparable to Earls or Moxies but the food is much better. They have a good selection of beers and cocktails as well.   Unfortunately my fiancée's burger came out with a piece of wax paper still on the burger; they forgot to take it off! Rather than stomp our feet and make a scene (we're civilized haha ;)), we kindly let the server know. We were in a bit of a rush so she continued on with the same burger, but the server did not hesitate to apologize and immediately offer us a new one. When we declined the manager even came over to try and offer the same and reiterate the apology, he even went as far as to communicate the mistake back to the kitchen given the rare occurrence. Anyone who has read my reviews before knows that I'm a very fair person when it comes to mistakes, and the team here handled this flawlessly. Nothing is worse than lack of accountability, they were completely accountable and did everything to make the situation right, and when we declined they took it off the bill! That's top notch service! The rest of the service was impeccable as well, their hostesses are always great and our server did an awesome job throughout our dining experience. Definitely felt accommodated and well looked after!  The restaurant itself is very modern and beautiful, this is consistent with any Cactus Club I've ever been to. Honestly I don't have anything bad to say about the Cactus Club Cafe, they're a great restaurant all around. They're' regularly recognized as one of the best managed companies in Canada, one of the best workplaces and a top employer for young people. Other restaurants should take note and would do well to learn from their success! They even focus on environmental sustainability, offer formal benefits, encourage training/education and pay for chefs pursuing their Red Seal certification. All of this translates into the best chain restaurant experience Canada has to offer! See you soon, cheers!"}
{"text":"The location and environment are great but that's as far as this restaurant is great. Typical misogyny thinking when choosing waitress, only hot girls (I love hot girls, but I don't like the way they are treated as part of the menu). The food is good but not great and the Expresso coffee is absolutely terrible! This is definitely a trendy and overpriced restaurant, not coming back."}
{"text":"First restaurant I had a meal at since arriving in Canada and I'm so glad I picked cactus club cafe! The service was great and the food was amazing! The tuna stack was delicious. I also got the spaghettini with kobe beef meatballs and omg that truffle oil in the noodles really got me. 10/10! After going to a bunch of other restaurants in Canada, my family and I agreed that cactus club cafe provided us with the best meal and dining experience. I wish we had a CCC in USA!"}
{"text":"A-Ok for Cactus Club.  I pass by this place all of the time.  It has an Earl's or Shark Club feel - waitresses in short dresses, loud music and an after work, financial district feel.  Although it's generally not the kind of place I would find myself after work, I had a nice summerlicious dinner with the girls on Wednesday.  The 4 of us sat upstairs in a spacious booth.  I liked the colour lights hanging over the bar up there.  I ordered the butternut squash ravioli to start, the peppercorn NY strip for the main and the chocolate mousse to finish it off.  The ravioli was amazing.  It just melted in your mouth.  It had shrimp on top, which I didn't feel added much to the dish.  I ended up mostly eating the shrimp separate and then the ravioli.  I think they put it in for protein and to beef up the dish a bit, but it's not really needed IMO.  That being said, I would order this again in a heartbeat.  I received my ravioli after everyone else received their apps (everyone else had the tuna tartare.  one was brought out for me, but that wasn't what I ordered.).  Fortunately their apps were cold b/c they insisted on waiting until I get mine.  Kind of shitty I had to wait, but the waitress was very apologetic,  The NY strip was cooked perfectly (medium rare), and the buttered potatoes and asparagus were delicious accompaniments.  My boyfriend and I always say, don't order steak unless you're at a steak house (b/c it seems that restaurants always f*ck it up), but this entree was actually quite tasty.  Although I much prefer steak at a steakhouse, this one was a step above most non-steakhouse restaurants, as they at least cooked it properly.   The chocolate mousse at the end wasn't much a mousse, rather more of a soup.  Definitely not the star of the meal and I would not order this again."}
{"text":"One thing I love about the cactus club is consistency in the food quality. This has never disappointed- not here or in its Vancouver locations.  I had wanted to go to this new Toronto addition since it opened and by chance we decided to walk in and it was also happy hour. We thought it was quiet until we were told that service was only on its rooftop level. To our surprise it was filled so we sat by the bar.  We ordered one of everything on the happy menu and another round of those truffle fries. Those fries are hands down - the very best fries I have had in this city. I still crave them.  The sandwiches were good but nothing beats those must have fries. The other stand out on their HH menu -the fish tacos.   I haven't gone back for the evening menu but I do have high hopes for it considering my previous experience.   Best bellinis -hands down. Order one or two - it's another must have beverage if you've not tried it.   Definitely returning."}
{"text":"An absolutely fabulous meal after a long time in Banff eating mediocre food. We had the hunter chicken and the short ribs. Both were great. As was the peanut butter crunch bar for dessert.  Service was phenomenal as well. Very friendly, very helpful, very nice!"}
{"text":"I guess this is the place to hang out at the Financial District in Toronto now. It's almost impossible to get in there without reservations and if you want to even go by the bar and drink, sometimes you are not permitted. Let the place enjoy the hype till it can! :) What makes it stand out is the ambience and the location. I love the lighting effect here. The wait staff is very friendly and nice The food is good, reasonably priced with other places nearby. I'd love to visit this place again only if it were a bit less crowded but I guess with this being one of the top places for bankers now to hang out, it won't be that easy!"}
{"text":"We were there with friends from the US last Friday night. The drinks were substandard in terms to their pour.  My husband wouldn't tell me what our bill was because I would be disgruntled. I had wine but my husband and our friends had mixed drinks.  They swore there was no alcohol in them.  We will not be going back for that reason. We all felt it was a loud and fun ambience but we were totally ripped off and disappointed."}
{"text":"\"oh my goodness... this is the best sangria ever!\"  What time we arrived/Wait time? I made a reservation at 2:45pm on a Tuesday so we we did not have a wait time nor was the restaurant too busy at that time. The restaurant filled up almost completely by the time we left which was around 4:30pm. I was recommended this place by a co-worker because it is her go-to spot. She told me that if I HAD to go to the rooftop patio or else there was no point in going! So I made to sure to call ahead and request a spot on the patio. They told me that they only take requests in case of weather complications. It also seems like Cactus Club is composed of 3 different restaurants - each being on a different floor!  Atmosphere? I absolutely was blown away by the interior of the rooftop. It is so so beautiful and such a fun environment. The music wasn't too loud either. There were fun couch seats around the edge, but we did not get seated there (I think those are for bigger groups). There are sheer, white curtains that I believe you can close if you wanted more privacy... it made the place look more like a resort and added a poise vibe.  Service/Staff? It seemed as if all the servers were women. They weren't the friendliest but everything was brought to us in a timely manner so I have no real complaints.   Food/Menu? The menu is a simple two pager which I like because when there are too many options then it gets really confusing for me to choose.  For drinks- we started with the \"rose sangria\" and a \"signature sangria\". They both had sprite in them which made them fizzy and the flavours were AMAZING! We said they both tasted similar to slushies but the signature sangria was much better so get the one for sure!!! I have tried SO many sangrias in my life and that one in particular was very high up there. For mains - she recommended the chicken creole and the poke bowl so we each got that. The poke bowl was very fresh with the mangoes and salmon, and the chicken creole with asparagus/mashed potatoes was really tasty and simple. It was the perfect portion.   Overall we loved loved loved this place and would totally go back! Would be so much for a night out for a friends birthday or even for a nice lunch."}
{"text":"Never get tired of Cactus Club and there are only two in Calgary and this location is always lively and busy.   Staff are friendly and quick on their service. Menu has evolved over the years but food is always consistent.   Dining area has a mix of tables with chairs and booths. The bar area has a central bar surrounded by chairs and booths on the outside.   Large heated inside patio with lots of windows to feel like it's outside.   Fish tacos, burgers and Cajun chicken are my favourites here.   Overall fantastic restaurant to check out in N.E. Calgary."}
{"text":"Unbelievable food, great service, and super hip scene.  Call for a reservation because this place can get packed.  Request for the rooftop and hope they can accommodate you.  We had the shrimp raviolis, tuna tartar, jambalaya bowl and teriyaki chicken rice bowl.  All were excellent"}
{"text":"Wowzers  Great spot for a happy hour stop! The sliders here were excellent and the service excellent. The ambience is very European and hipster. There is a good Food selection so there is something for everyone!"}
{"text":"Wow what a difference 10 years makes... The last time I was here they used to have peanuts all over the floor and it was my first visit to a cactus club... Now it is almost like a club.. What a change... But boy, the feenie flatbread is sure a nice dinner.. You gotta try it!"}
{"text":"I found this place pretentious. The hostess's comments were overly rehearsed, and she tried to make small talk. The less obstacles between me and my food, the better...  Our server was entertaining (and it wasn't rehearsed). She was prompt,  efficient, and awesome.  We started with beef carpaccio. It was splendid. I had salmon, and my bf had a steak. Both entrees were delicious.   I found this place has no real unique identity. The decor is generic, and unmemorable. There was no personality.   Great food, and good service, without atmosphere."}
{"text":"Our waitress was extremely kind. Our group had to go to this place last minute on a very busy night and they found a way to accommodate 9 of us. Very happy with the speed and quality of service as well. Will be coming back and bringing friends"}
{"text":"They seat us on couch, so uncomfy for dinner! So many pillows.  Very, very loud. Love Drake. Only Drake for hours.  No chicken tenders upstairs.   Edamame was BURNED. I know, my fault, for order Japanese here, but disgusting!  I ride up and down so many elevators I feel like Charlie in the Chocolate Factory."}
{"text":"Was pretty happy to see this location open up right across from my office, lots of nice work lunches with my co-workers! They have some great, super filling salads that are usually my go-to although I have also heard good things about the bowls. This location gets BUSY with the downtown work crowd though so be prepared if you're going for lunch. They do take reservations though and when I was booking for 4-6 people that is the best way to make sure we get in. You can enter through the mall or directly off Stephen Ave. If you can have a fun working lunch or you're off early the Frose was delicious, a little too delicious in my opinion."}
{"text":"Basically the place to be and be seen after work.  It's so poppin.  Ton of people, music blasting.  If you're tying to meet someone, this is the place to go.  I; however, was just tryna get a table on the first day of Summerlicious, which was also a Friday.... I wasn't able to get a reso obvz, but their site does say a large portion of their restaurant is left open for walk-ins.  We decided to take a chance.    My gf and I arrived around 5:30 and was told there were about 20 groups ahead of us waiting to get on the patio.  20!?  We decided to wait. They have a texting system to let you know when your table is ready, which is convenient.  Cactus Club is located inside the First Canadian Place building, so there was a ton of places to sit and shop. Enough to do to kill time.  It took about 30 minutes for me to get the text.  Not bad for 20 groups ahead of us.  We were obvz there for drinks and Summerlicious.  I started with their feature drink, the Frose and my gf got the Bellini.  Holy crap, the frose was amazing. As was the Bellini!  But omg, I could've ordered another 3 Froses if I wasn't so stuffed from all the food.  I love slushy fruity drinks.  So if you're into that, the Frose and Bellini are your best friends. Also, they are not strong at all.  For my starter, I got the kale salad and my gf got the Butternut Squash Ravioli Duo.  Omg, the kale salad was SO delicious.  Like it's just a kale salad, but the dressing they use, the way they put it together, I don't know.  It was GOOD.  I've been obsessed ever since taking that first bite!  My gf said the ravioli was indeed also, amazing.  We both got the steaks for our main and they were cooked EXACTLY to our liking.  I got mine medium and her, medium rare.  Her's was bloody, just the way a vampire would like it.  The main was a pretty big portion.  I finished it because, it was just in me to do, but it was too much for my gf.  I did find it a bit on the salty side and it must be the sauce they use.  I think the dish could do without the sauce or with a little less.  For dessert, I got the chocolate peanut butter crunch bar (what a mouthful!) and my gf got the chocolate mousse. My dessert was pretty good especially with the ice cream.  I don't think I could eat the whole thing without ice cream.  It's so rich and chocolaty. My gf's mousse was so cute.  It was warm and came in three little shot glasses.  It was basically like hot chocolate with toffee bits.  I would say it was yummy, but not something I would ever order.  Overall our experience was great.  It was raining on and off that day, so they had to keep closing the roof and opening it again.  If there was a sudden downpour though, they would be screwed cuz that damn roof is slow as hell.  We got a few raindrops on us but nothing serious.  Our server was sweet, no complaints with her.  Oh and the restaurant is effing huge.  There's so many floors and you can actually get lost in the place."}
{"text":"There is only one vegan option on the menu (unmarked), but it was pretty good.  About 4 stars.  The beer choices are limited and the descriptions misleading.  Minus 1/2 a star for that.  The service was definitely 5-star.  I was amazed at how friendly they were are how deftly they handled the difficult diners in our group.  Huzzah!"}
{"text":"The Millionaire steak was amazing.  The wait staff very friendly.  I could not quite figure out what this place is trying to be, but somehow I enjoyed it.  It is not quite upscale in the decor, but the food and prices were quite upscale.  Maybe this is normal for Calgary....and what is the deal with dry rubbed ribs in this town?  Say hi to Emory.  Dafe"}
{"text":"Great food, nice ambiance, good service. Would definitely recommend!  Menu favourites: try the jambalaya and the toffee chocolate mousse. Delicious! They also have a great variety of drinks."}
{"text":"Giving this 5 stars although it's inflated because Gerrard Butler walked in, sat in a booth across from our table and chatted with our group before going over! Omg Gerrard Butler!  Very excited to try this place. A franchise from Western Canada and this is the first location east of Manitoba. This specific location is in a prime location with a very Joey like feel but the menu and the food is elevated and a lot tastier in my opinion.   Atmosphere   Very nice modern look, 3 floors, great vibe and great bathrooms! Some of the best you'll see. Great vibe and very nice feel with the multi levels.   Food  The head chef here was a winner on iron chef, and his signature menu is very delicious looking but pricey. The regular menu has a great selection of apps, mains, burgers, steaks, fish and other options and they are not pricey. They are very fairly priced and what you'd expect from a Joey almost.   For apps we went with the Tuna, Shrimp Ravioli, and lettuce wraps. The reviews were unanimous, they were delicious and worth the order.   For my main I had the head chef signature burger, very juicy, lots of flavour. The aioli was a nice Chipotle with dill and herbs and it was so good! Sorry for the idiot sounding review with lack of articulation but I was impressed and it was a great meal."}
{"text":"I love this place, especially in the summer time.  Customer service and food quality is great for the prices. You go to other places like Moxies or Earls's and it can't compare.  I find Cactus is a classier and higher level compared to those restaurants. The other restaurants food is just sub par.  Love the quinoa salad and the wu-tang-tini. The sabblefish is exquisite.  Overall all the food is delicious.  Overall a great place but it is hard to get a reservation but well worth it."}
{"text":"I visited the Cactus Club last night and found it to be a delightfully classy, stylish and modern restraunt with an energetic atmosphere without being too in-your-face. They offer a selection of classic North American and international Asian and Mexican favourites, artfully and tastefully prepared, giving an upscale vibe that at the same time won't break the bank. The courteous and attentive young staff were exceptionally helpful, accommodating and kind to my disabled dining partner, making a potentially awkward dining experience easy and pleasant for us. I have to highly recommend Rob's Flatbread, a tasty and unique combination of flavours that puts an interesting spin on a familiar dish without being too foreign to the average diner's palette. The muzak leaves something to be desired, but overall I had a great experience at the Cactus Club. I'll be returning and bringing my friends with me!"}
{"text":"My first visit to this location was before heading to a concert at The Palace. I felt a bit under dressed for the straggling business dinner crowd on a weekday evening.  Our server was great, despite the place being busy he was right there when needed. I went with the steak which was perfectly cooked to my request.   I find things a little tightly packed compared to their other locations. Not uncommon though for a downtown restaurant like this when they need to maximize square-footage at higher rents."}
{"text":"Awesome food great atmosphere and amazing service. Me and my sister are visiting from Vancouver we went with Our cousin and his girlfriend. Right off the bat our server Billy was super friendly and witty. He made our experience such a good time. Anyway awesome place to go."}
{"text":"I enjoyed good food tonight but terrible service from the server.   I ordered an avocado modern bowl which is on the menu for $16 along with shrimp on the side and was charged $2.50 for extra avocado (when I didn't order or receive any extra avocado). Once I saw the bill I mentioned it to the server (Chantel) and she told me the modern bowl with avocado doesn't include avocado. I insisted and showed her the menu at which point she adjusted the bill. When she brought the bill back she didn't say sorry for the mistake, and proceeded to ignore us for the rest of our time there (didn't offer to refill empty water or speak to us). She was clearly very annoyed which was uncalled for given we treated her very respectfully the whole night."}
{"text":"Great lunch stop with a wide variety on the menu. Staff is friendly and atmosphere is inviting."}
{"text":"My friend, my little brother from another mother, Jay (Epicurean305), is in town and it's always a culinary adventure when he's around. The Cactus Club wasn't on his radar for this trip but I've heard it mentioned several times and was intrigued to see that Chef Rob Feenie was behind it. He did, after all, beat Iron Chef Morimoto, the first Canadian chef to win Iron Chef America. We just had to try it!  We were joined by a couple of fellow explorers and we were not disappointed! The flaming displays, the intimate lighting, the hip music, the decor, all made a good first impression. Nice place!  We started with cocktails, all very delicious concoctions. The Perfect Storm, their signature cocktail, stood out with its bold ginger beer and Kraken Spiced Rum flavours. Wow, what a punch in the face but it was so good, I had to turn the other cheek and take another one. My dining companions abandoned their choices and tried it too! ;)  For appetizers, we had the Tuna Stack and the Spicy Chicken. The tuna was a tartare, stacked on avocado, and served with wonton chips. It kinda tasted like sushi, in a very good way. High quality sushi. The spicy chicken was prepared with a sweet chili glaze and served with crispy wonton bits, creating a nice texture. Both dishes were delicious.  It was hard to choose from all the wonderful descriptions on the menu but I had my eye on the Duck Confit from the very beginning. Jay, always looking to try something different, ordered the BBQ Duck Clubhouse sandwich - Peking duck, roasted chicken, and prosciutto. Definitely an interesting combination. Our companions opted for safer (boring) choices in a Short Rib Pappardelle and Cheddar Bacon Burger. Really? You guys come to the guy who beat Iron Chef Morimoto and you order pasta and a burger??? Okay, so the burger that we saw served at a nearby table did look good.  Wow! The presentation of the food that we received was impressive, even the appetizers and cocktails. The short ribs were melt-in-your-mouth tender and the portion was generous enough to take home half of it. The burger was huge, juicy, and delicious! So were the truffle fries. Okay, so they made good choices. Jay's duck sandwich was also very delicious.  The Duck Confit was OMG delicious and deserves its own paragraph! It was served on a bed of lentils, and topped with a baby frisee salad. I tried the lentils first and they were so tasty and then I discovered the bacon in there. Wow! I never knew lentils could taste this good. Maybe it's true, bacon makes everything taste better. The duck was so tender but had some crispy bits for a nice contrast in texture. Every mouthful of this dish revealed a burst of flavour. I loved it!  I would definitely recommend Cactus Club. Nice ambiance, good menu, great tasting food, excellent service, highly recommended!"}

{"text":"I had an 8:30PM supper meeting with a former colleague visiting from out of town, and I ordered a classic burger with button mushrooms and bacon, plus a side of yam fries. The burger was moist, juicy, tasty--and too big for me to finish, so I couldn't sample any of the desserts. Our server was attentive, upbeat, efficient, friendly, and prompt. Good, positive vibe overall."}
{"text":"Went there today for a nice lunch with a girlfriend, the first hostess that greeted us took another table in and mentioned with a smile that she would be right back, the second hostess who came up to help was visibly annoyed that we had requested the patio on a warm sunny Saturday afternoon, we waited about 10-15 minutes and were taken out to a lovely table.   Our waitress was quiet but pleasant and brought out our drinks quickly. The only comment that I had was that the stem of my sangria glass was quite sticky, before I had even touched it. She took our order and within no time we were taking our first bites of their potato skins. It wasn't until my friend noticed that there was bacon on them when we had requested otherwise that there was a problem. As two vegetarians you can imagine our dismay, but the waitress and the manager both apologized for the mistake and took away the offending food and brought us new potato skins immediately. The whole situation was handled very well and I commend the waitress for realizing so quickly that something was wrong, and the manager for helping as well. Our second course was the garden burger with a Caesar salad. The Caesar was covered in freshly grated Parmesan cheese, bonus points for that, and not too much-not too little dressing. The veggie burger itself however was to die for. Juicy, saucy, delicious, everything you want a burger to be. I find as a vegetarian, people make veggie burgers for the health conscious with a brown whole wheat bun and an assortment of vegetables that shouldn't belong anywhere near a burger. This burger was the wrap your mouth around and sink your teeth into burger I have been waiting for. PERFECT. my friend and I raved about this burger for 8 hours following our meal.   Some final notes, another manager stopped by while we were eating our veggie burgers to make sure those we done nicely and they took care of part of our bill for the mistake about the potato skins. Very nice gesture and one that will keep me coming back.   The only negatives about this whole experience was the seemingly unpleasant girl at the door, and a sticky sangria glass.  Will most definitely be returning, thank you cactus club for the amazing food and service."}
{"text":"It's an interesting place. Eclectic. Asian inspired yet a bit Tex mex yet a bit Italian. Good service. Very limited vegetarian food. The server pointed me to the flat bread and salads. A place like this should have way more options. Joeys and Earls are better in this regard. Prices were a bit high."}
{"text":"Coming here for a friend's birthday was a good experience. We had dressed up and froze ourselves in the cold, but it was a lot of fun.  We had ordered a lot of appetizers to share. The deep fried calamari, mini burgers, chicken wrap, and sweet potato fries. As a big fan of sweet potatoes, their fries were made quite well, the spicy mayo was a great accompaniment. The mini burgers were also really good as the sauce had a sweetness to it that worked wonderfully with the saltiness of the beef burger.   For entrees, we ordered the Butternut Squash Ravioli, Hunter's Chicken, Fish Tacos, and Quinoa Salad. The ravioli was definitely a new taste as the filling was sweet and surprisingly good. However, for the price, it wasn't exactly worth it. The chicken was cooked well and wasn't dry, the peas and mushrooms were a good side, there wasn't anything bad about it, but it was a rather plain dish.   The fish tacos were definitely the best out of all the entrees as the fish had been deep fried, but the batter was fried to the perfectly crisp and the fish inside still was tender and crumbled like it was never fried before.   For desert, we had a complimentary birthday cake for the friend who we were celebrating for and the chocolate cake was pretty good, it melted well and the ice cream worked well with it. We also ordered a chocolate lava cake and when we cut into it, we were disappointed that no chocolate oozed out, but it still tasted very good."}
{"text":"It was our first time here and the food was delicious. The portions were also a good size. Our server was fabulous too! (?Brooklyn) She was very knowledgeable about the food, helpful in making our decision and super friendly! We will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Probably the best service I've ever had at any place I've been to. They struggled to get my steak just right, came out a little too well done around the outside and I unfortunately had to send it back and wait for another one. It took a little while, but they made sure I wasn't hungry and gave me a plate of food - for free, mind you - whilst I waited. When we had finished our meal, and the bill came, they did not charge me and apologized profusely for the steak. Didn't NOT want to pay - as the food was delicious! - so offered to tip instead. Will definitely be returning, with many people on many more occasions and recommending this to everyone I can. The staff was so, so lovely! Vibe is amazing, too. Only negative is the wait time but honestly, it was worth waiting an hour and half for the customer service and quality of food."}
{"text":"Cactus Club Cafe is my favourite \"upscale casual\" restaurant in Calgary.  I  love and often crave their version of tuna tataki.  I have tried many of their menu items and they are all delicious.  On time my young son ordered the mini burgers and they were over salted.  The waitress took them away right away and fixed the problem without making him feel like a complainer.  The only fault I can find with Cactus Club Calgary is their locations aren't great.  I live inner city and I'd love to see a location closer to the downtown core."}
{"text":"First of all, delicious!! Attentive, friendly staff and great ambient. I ordered the Sablefish, it's so soft that it melts in your mouth. Has a touch of sweetness to it and very juicy. Exactly the way I like my fish (which I just realized after trying it.) So I will definitely go back. My only complaint is there's not a lot of cactus club in Toronto. Just one! They should open up in other places."}
{"text":"The best food I have had inCanada or anywhere for that matter. Butternut squash ravioli with prawns is wonderful. Wish I lived closer"}
{"text":"The current hotspot for fixtures in the Financial District. Literally, the ideal location for a work lunch or meeting, and it's also a popular spot for after-work drinks, dinner, etc. For the most part, I know it as the go-to for many colleagues and executives - it's a place to see, and be seen, while eating a meal where quality of the food meets quality of the environment. Beautiful decor, carefully prepared food, attentive service, and you're treated very, very well - a great spot for both professional and personal meet-ups.   I visited for lunch recently and we ended up sharing a few appetizers. Prices are what you would expect, but the variety of the menu was certainly a surprise to me - from steak, to burgers, to salmon, to chicken wings. The menu isn't pretentious at all and caters to a variety of palates. We ordered: the Beef Carpaccio, Dry Rub Chicken Wings, Szechuan Chicken Lettuce Wraps and the Soy-Dijon Salmon to share. Everything was cooked perfectly, with the Beef Carpaccio starter being the highlight. Generous portions, well-seasoned. No complaints and a wonderful surprise to discover that the food is just as excellent as the atmosphere.   It's located at the southwest corner of Bay and Adelaide. Also note: make reservations. This place gets busy, especially with large groups. So book your table earlier than later."}
{"text":"Great food, the service was nice, and the atmosphere is just right. Staff is friendly and attentive, would come back again"}
{"text":"On a Tuesday evening at 5:45pm they were out of hunters chicken...how is that possible? The steaks and salmon are a good option. Waiters are not that nice or accommodating. Atmosphere is nice and lively."}
{"text":"This cactus club by far has the worst customer service, the waitresses are snobby and rude. They have no regard or care for their customers."}
{"text":"I have to admit that when I eat out, I tend to go to hole in the wall places rather than chain restaurants. I like the small restaurant atmosphere rather than large bars but Cactus Club really did surprise me. It is a big chain restaurant but the seating is very cozy and gave me the small restaurant feels I was looking for. The servers were fantastic as well and we didn't have to wait at all on a busy Saturday night.   I ordered the four mushroom sirloin cooked medium rare with yam fries and asparagus as sides ($29). For drinks - I got the peach bellini ($6). For dessert I had the key lime pie ($8). The steak was done perfectly! I was really impressed with it! The sides were yummy as well. The key lime pie was amazing and I would definitely go back just for that. Sometimes I worry with chains that the quality can be sporadic depending on the cook but each time I come here, the food and service is great!"}
{"text":"The food is reasonable. Servers very friendly. Some of them struggle to place orders on iPad but they make up for it in service.   Terrible Cesar. The drink itself  has a bad taste and they tried to hard to put a twist on garnish ..... it is a fail.   The bartender staff can be a little rude. The server was very polite and tried very hard to make up for bartender."}
{"text":"- What I have tried:    + Tuna Stack (5/5): really good, I would say this dish was the highlight of the night. The vegetable ingredients blended so well with tuna and the flavour was so unique when we ate it with wonton chips     + Duck confit (5/5): pretty good, the meat was so tender and the sauce was perfectly made, not too sweet or salty     + Sangria (4/5): The sangria here is ok, I prefer the sangria from gusto101 more     + Flawty Tower(4.5/5): basically gin lychee and grapefruit, it tastes pretty good tho, has a bit of bitterness in it    + Pimm's cup (5/5): this one is the sweetest (which I like) out of all, strong taste of mint lime and ginger ale  - Service was fast and very active  - Space is pretty big, and good music  - Pricey is a bit pricey but worth every penny"}
{"text":"Cactus Club Cafe joins the rest of the chained restaurants in a fight to claim Toronto's premier cocktail restaurant spot. And I think it's definitely up there with the very best.  We went with a group of 4 to Cactus on a Sunday evening. The place was very busy, and looking great with the fire display outside. Upon being seated upstairs by very friendly staff, the ambience was a lot better than I expected it to be. The arrangement of the restaurant placed the bar in the middle, with seating covering 360 degrees around it. Restaurant tables are scattered on the outer perimeter of the restaurant, making this place feel incredibly lounge-y and stylish. It is definitely more cozy than it appears on the outside.   Onto the menu, it reads like a typical pub/bar selection with a bit of flair. It was nice seeing that the prices are reasonable for food of this calibre, as well as offering enough classic selections (such as steak and burgers) even for the non-decisive ones. We opted for the hunter chicken with pan jus and the pappardelle pasta. The chicken was tender and juicy, presumably cooked under sous vide or rotisseries style, which worked well with the medley of vegetables that complimented it. The pasta was seasoned nicely and had sufficient moisture in the braised short rib. All in all, the food did not blown our minds, but was definitely delicious with our drink pairings.   Cactus Club Cafe resembles the embodiment of what a great cocktail bar / pub restaurant should be. It offers sophisticated yet classic selections that tastes both great and looks great. Environment was cozy and upscaled. Would recommend for any Friday nights."}
{"text":"This is a pretty nice place to have a casual drink and appetizers. I can here during happy hour where appetizers were $4 each (mini burger, fish taco, truffle fries, mini chicken sandwich) and $1 off daily drink specials.   Service was quick and the bartender made pretty good recommendations based on my preference. I ended up ordering the Bellini which is a sweeter, fruitier drink with a heavy strawberry flavour. Highly recommended if you enjoy that type of drink. I also got the mini burger, truffle fries and fish taco. Keep in mind that these are all very small appetizer portions for one person. Every item was cooked perfectly - fish in the taco was light and crispy, the beef was medium rare, and the fries had great truffle flavour sprinkled with parmesan. The fries were probably one of the best fries I've had. I can see why they are so popular.  Overall, this is a great place to chill out during happy hour."}
{"text":"This place looked really cool and I had high hopes as we ate here our last night in Houston - it was packed , people were lining up to get in but ultimately it might just be as it's trendy as for me it was just okay  We did not get off to a great start - we had reservations but were left sitting for over 20 minutes as other parties that came in after us were seated. Finally my husband mentioned to the hostess that we had received a text about a table but she was rude and dismissive - clearly stressed by her \" complex \" role of greeting people.  I was about to walk when another kids attentive hostess came along, immediately read the situation and had us seated immediately ! She was also kind enough to come by and apologize with a free appetizer which was a nice touch!  We ordered a bottle of cab which was good and a mix of appetizers and mains - honestly the menu was a bit all over the place with fish tacos and burgers on the same menu as rabbit confit?! But that said it caters to a diverse post work crowd  The ceviche was great , the tuna dish also good though needed a bit more heat; the edamame were way over salted but cooked just perfectly.  My husband tried the rabbit confit and loved it but the let down was the fish tacos - now in full disclosure last time we had this was ocean front on some great fish restaurants in San Diego which is pretty much the home to these but though I could not expect these to compare , they were just not right - the tortillas tasted like cheap store bought - no one ate them - and were tiny which would have been okay had the filling followed suit but it was overstuffed. Fish was great but the cabbage had clearly been pre made in dressing and was soggy and then a great big lump of what tasted like jarred salsa was thrown on top - we had to scrape it off   Service was okay though again our waitress was new and being trained so she did do her best and the other thing that irked me was how dark it was - I get it was supposed to be dark and intimate but you needed the candle on the table just to be able to see the menu .  Kinda felt like an after work appetizer place more than a nice restaurant and I wish we had selected somewhere different and perhaps more focused for our last meal in Toronto"}
{"text":"1. The tuna stack is my favorite!  2. The butternut squash raviloi is amazing! 3. Fish tacos are good not amazing. But good!   Service is 10/10   I would highly reccomend this place."}
{"text":"Met here for a business lunch, which is a bit unconventional, as it's really a bar/lounge. But the patios were full. Had the yummy kale salad with grilled salmon as the protein. Super quick service. Ate at the bar as everything else was full.. but the food and service was still good. Seems like a better fit for evening hang outs.. so would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Decided to bring the family all the way to Downtown for the new Cactus Club Café Stephen Avenue.  Last Friday, I lined up for a dessert give-away (Peanut Butter Crunch - delicious) by Cactus Club Café Stephen Avenue and also received a free $10 gift card for use only on Sat & Sun!  What better way to try out the new restaurant!  We ordered the following: - Wor Wonton Soup with Added Shrimp - contains bbq pork, peking duck broth, lemongrass and bbq pork wontons, noodles, mixed vegetables.  This noodle soup was well-received.  I tasted a bit of the wonton and it was freshly made.  The soup was very fragrant as it's made with Peking duck broth.  Unusual for duck broth to be used instead of just plain old chicken soup. - Jambalaya Rice Bowl - Quite a delicious mix of shrimp, chicken, andouille sausage, vegetables, bacon, spicy tomato sauce, black bean salsa, crème fraiche.  I had a couple of taste tests and it was quite delicious. - Short Rib Sandwich - made up of caramelized onions, beef jus, emmental cheese, toasted sourdough - the dip that came with this rich short rib sandwich accented it really well!  Comes with fries.  Love the emmental cheese!  You can switch to salad for $2 more.  Quite a nice sandwich and I'd eat it again. - BBQ Duck Clubhouse - what an interesting mix of meat and bread!  I.e., peking duck, roasted chicken, prosciutto di modena, pecan fruit bread - .  Each item compliments each other very well.  Comes with fries.  As above, salads can be substituted for $2 more.  All in all, a nice space of booths in the centre and tables near the windows.  There's also a bar that is cut off from the restaurant space by a glass door.    Will be back.  The only con I have is that you cannot make reservations for groups smaller than 8 and there are very limited reservations for groups 8 and greater."}
{"text":"There are not many times I can give a perfect score on each attribute. Ambiance, service and food. We were here for a christmas party with about a 90+ guests. Beautiful ambiance was the first eye catching note. Clean. Candles. Good music at the right volume.   The service was excellent. They cleared all tables, brought endless appetisers, drink order, took orders for each table and brought the right food to the right person all this without feeling or appearing rushed. Even too images for patrons.   Lastly the food. What amazed me the most was the consistency. Each and every plate, every morsel, was done right. We had options for Salmon, chicken and Risotto with Prawns. Each one was done right. Tender, juicy and full of flavour. The Butternut squash soup was excellence, and finishing up with the key lime pie was just right. Options for latte, coffee, tea etc at the end.   What a delightful experience."}
{"text":"We went here for a friend and my birthday. This is the perfect mix between restaurant and Lounge. Great music food and service. They are a little pricy so if you're not trying to spend money this isn't the place to go too. Also if you don't make a reservation, wear your gym shoes because you will wait, a long time. We didn't run into these issues because we made a reservation 2 weeks in advance. I would definitely come back"}
{"text":"I've been to two of the Calgary locations and this restaurant near the airport has to be the best one!  We went in late August and sat outside on the patio where they had the fireplace/torches going for warmth. It had a modern and romantic ambiance.  The food and drinks were just amazing here. The tuna stack appetizer was to die for. I am still drooling over it four months later! The truffle fries and aioli were perfect as well. I had The Brazilian cocktail which was delicious.   I'll return to this location again!"}
{"text":"Great patio with a fire pit and cozy blankets for chilly summer nights. I have to admit that I miss the Spiked Frap, a frothy frozen frap in a martini glass that they stopped serving years ago."}
{"text":"Great place for late night food and drinks. We were kindly greeted and welcomed. The DJ is amazing. Security was on point. This place is absolutely amazing! A must try when visiting Calgary."}
{"text":"Definitely recommend the Rob's Crispy Chicken Sandwich. The employee's are very kind and our server was attentive and sweet. Will for sure be going back."}
{"text":"We visited this location and our order was prepared incorrectly the server was quick to ensure we received the accurate order and really went above and beyond. We ordered the tuna stack as an appetizer and it was scrumptious! The kale salad with salmon was well made. Reservations are a must for good seating."}
{"text":"Servers were attentive. Calamari appetizer was delicious. It was melting in my mouth. It was served on a timely manner. The Belinnis were also really good."}
{"text":"Went here recently on a Saturday night and everything was superb!  We didn't have to wait very long (10min) to get a table downstairs by the bar without a reservation at 7pm.  I used to frequent this chain when I traveled for business in western Canada and although they don't have the JD ribs anymore, they have a wide selection of dishes that will satisfy any urge you have.  I had the 7oz filet w/fries and kale salad and the steak was perfect and really like the horseradish!  Fries were good although it's hard to screw up fries and salad was fresh and dressed perfectly. I couldn't resist the chocolate mousse cake and it was delish!  My girlfriend had the lambchops and it was another winner.  The service was great and while it was a bit noisy (as you'd expect), it had a really cool vibe.  It had a similar feel to earls, milestones etc but I think the menu looks a bit better.  I'll be going back to try the ravioli and the duck confit!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I wish I could afford coming here more often. Luckily, they have happy hour!   Great service, very tasty food, delicious cocktails; The Bellini is so good! I went on a Thursday and they had tacos on special and those were yummy. It is a great place for after-work drinks."}
{"text":"Came here for a business lunch with three others and you can notice the majority male clientele when you enter the place.  Servers are dressed in the \"business sexy\" attire.  It's the kind of place that if you like the \"friendly\" attention by 20 year old girls looking for big fat tips then this is your place!  I ordered the seared tuna club with Caesar salad.  My salad was very heavy on the garlic and a bit soggy with dressing.  My sandwich I thought has too much mayo as it drowned out the taste but it was okay!  Business colleagues ordered a variety of things.  The best looked to be the jambalaya!  In this area there is quite the competition for the men's dollar.  Joey's and Earl's are just down the street!  Food to me was 3 out of 5.  Business colleagues seemed to enjoy it so that's what matters!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday evening and the place was hopping, I've been to Cactus Club many times in BC, but the Toronto location definitely has an umph that the BC chain did not (likely because of the location, much like Earl's). We showed up for our 6:30pm reservation to see two lines the one for reservations and the one for walk-ins, the wait time for walk-ins was about an hour. There are a line of hostesses waiting to seat parties, but they still told us that it would be about 10-15 minutes for our table to be ready...usually when I make a reservation I expect to be seated within 5 to 10 minutes of my reservation, but we didn't get seated until almost 20 minutes later.   The place was loud and busy, bustling with the first round of afterwork crowd. Our server was kind, and consistently filled our waters and checked in on us a good amount. I ordered the jalepeno margarita (just add jalepenos and cilantro to your margarita and you've recreated it, but the smoked salt on the side was way toooo overpowering, it's all you can smell, and subsequently taste, when you have this drink).  My friend got the fawlty tower, which was tasty and fresh, but definitely a sweeter drink.   We ordered the chargrilled steak (done well to a nice medium rare albeit quite tough, with buttery mash, and perfectly done asparagus...the asparagus was the best part of the dish!!!) and the squash ravioli with prawns (ahem....shrimps...I've legitimately had shrimps that were bigger than my prawns, they weren't overcooked which was nice, but the pasta was too doughy and not cooked properly, so i could still taste the doughy-ness and the whole dish just tastes like butter...everything is just pure butter - which is nice if you're partial to pasta with butter, but that was not my childhood)....  The cheesecake at the table next to us looked delicious, so  I think I'd come back for that and the cocktails and service are good (once you are seated). Being a Toronto \"hot spot\" I'm sure I'll be back, but it definitely isn't my first choice."}
{"text":"Some friends and I came here on a Friday evening for drinks and food. We really enjoyed it. I thought the food and drinks we ordered were all very good and overall vibe in the restaurant was great. The wait to get a table was a bit long ~ 30 minutes as we didn't have a reservation, however they had 3 bars where you can wait for your table and grab a drink so it really isn't much of a wait.  We waited at the second floor bar area and got some drinks. I tried the Perfect Storm and it was delicious. Just the right amount of spicy kick and I do love ginger beer. Bar area is a big oval circle and people were sitting all around it. The place was bustling with people but it wasn't crowded or uncomfortable which I find is really  hard to pull off.  Soon after we were seated at our table and we ordered some plates to share such as the fried calamari, the tuna stack, and the chicken wings. All 3 plates were a hit and soooo gooood! Especially loved the tuna stack. The flavours were irresistible. The calamari was some of the best I've ever had. For main, I got the steak and fries. Steak was fine, it was a leaner cut but it wasn't outstanding. Definably bit disappointing compared to the appetizers that I loved. The fries however is another story. This restaurant serves my favorite fries in the world. Seriously I never ate so much fries in my life. I ate mine, then my friends, then my husbands... and then I packed the leftovers home and the next day, I microwaved it and continued eating it and it was still SO GOOD. Just writing about it makes me want to eat it again. I have no idea how they make it but if I ever get a hold of that recipe, I'd probably become really really big. hahaha Anyways, I gotta go back to this place soon because I didn't get to try the dessert menu, and I want to try like the entire cocktail menu, as well as check out their rooftop patio. Prices were average for this type of establishment. Apps, 1 Main and 1 Drink was about $50 per person."}
{"text":"Calamari. Simply put an appetizer is going to completely make, or break the rest of your experience hands down.  The Chefs on deck literally cooked it perfectly as in it was not rubber you just chew and chew and chew. How ever, what ever batter they use before dropping it in the fryer is not a tasty one. I (my experience) found it was not on par with other establishment I have been to where a person could literally enjoy the dish with no sauce needed. Not much to bitch about!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! Great service!! Beautiful design ! Awesome atmosphere!  Highly recommended ! Wish we had more restaurants like this one in California..."}
{"text":"Really good food and drinks. They are expensive in their steaks and the noise was loud. But I would take anyone there for a meal. If of course they are footing the bill."}
{"text":"The location is huge, 3 levels and it gets pretty pack during lunch. They do take reservations but only through phone and not open table.  The girls at the front desk aren't the brightest... one of my parties came late and asked for the reservations name they just said \"no, sorry\". Couldn't you offer to ask more to help the place is 3 levels...  In terms of food, the flavour is amazing for a chain restaurant. The presentation and quality is 9/10.   Their Szechuan chicken lettuce wrap is very flavourful one of the best tasting appetizers.  The tuna stack is a tartar, that one comes with rice crackers. The crackers are very crunchy and a perfect match for the tartar.  Calamari was noting special, the pieces were small and not crunchy.  My main was the butternut squash ravioli with prawns. The portion is just right if you think it's a bit small. Mind you I did have 3 appetizers shared amongst 4 other ppl.   I ended with an earl gray tea. When it came i was surprised that the tea is organic which is not bad.  Will come again to try their other food as they do have a lot of selections."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places! The fish tacos are amazing, I am from LA and I know what true tacos are like. It's been incredibly hard to find some good tacos in Calgary, but these are really good. It's pretty close to an authentic fish taco. The veggie burger is good. The truffle fries are always my go to. The drinks are amazing. Ever since I ran into cactus club I've had a harder time exploring because I usually always want to go here. The service here is always good, I have no complaints so far. Thank you cactus club for always being a good experience and always being tasty."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a nice work lunch here earlier this week. It's important to note that even on a regular weekday (not a Friday) not being able to make reservations, this place will be jammed.  We arrived at 1145 and got our table for five at 1230. I enjoyed a yummy sangria while waiting. The wait was worth it as we landed a spot on the lovely rooftop terrace.  As for the food, well it was delicious. I did make an ordering error in that I thought I ordered the butternut squash soup with the appetizer ravioli (three) but I ended up with a meal size ravioli (seven). The ravioli seemed very thin so I ate all of it, but realized soon after that it was extremely filling. Delicious but uncomfortable lesson learned.  I would definitely go again. The atmosphere is great and food and drink enjoyable."}
{"text":"I brought some clients here for lunch.   Food that I had and the service were both excellent.  Appetizers that we shared were the tuna stack which was tuna tartar encrusted with a topping of bread crumbs or panko...mixed in with some peppers and veg accompanied with some crisps.  Fresh and tasty!  Even my client who didn't eat raw fish said that she was converted once she tasted that.  I highly recommend.  Another appetizer thay we shared was the tuna tataki. The seared slices sat on a bed of julienne carrots radishes and diakon.  Plated beautifully and tasted superb (however i do prefer the one served at Guu)  I had a veal pappardelle pasta in a cream sauce.  When the plate came it didnt look spectacular.  Just brown meat on a beige cream sauce and yellow noodles. Taste was amazing though.  I highly recommend visiting this place.  Definitely coming back again once i save up for it again...lol...Pricy but worth it!"}
{"text":"It's definitely a date night and girls night out kinda place. The ambience is romantic and club LIKE at the same time. They have 3 different floors for 3 different type of atmosphere which is quite good. The service is amazing and everyone is friendly. Definitely recommend for parties of 4 and more because their share plates are just amazing! All the portions were very generous.   What I ordered: prices range $10-30 Flatbread: it was an explosion of flavours. The bread was crispy and soft at the same time. The amount of sauce and toppings was perfect.  Lettuce wrap: this fusion chicken sweet and sour lettuce wrap is the \"bomb\". The chicken was so tender and the crunchy noodle on top of it was such an awesome combination. You get to make your own little taco lettuce wraps yourself and add as much sauce as you want.   Quinoa salad: this salad was pretty average but I like that they added raisins and walnuts to it to give it texture. The amount of feta cheese was just right. Not too much and not too little.  Hunter chicken: chicken breast with roasted mushrooms, asparagus and Yukon potatoes. The chicken was very tender and the dish provided different texture throughout. Seasoning wasn't too strong, personally would've preferred a bit more salt and pepper on it. But it was well worth.   Teriyaki chicken rice bowl: let's just say this is the best teriyaki rice bowl alive! A bit of a fusion taste because they added their very own spicy mayo mixture along with the teriyaki sauce. All the veggies gave it a fresh taste and texture to the mouth. Definitely a go to if you're feeling some fusion Asian food.   Gardenburger: swapped the side for truffle fries! The truffle fries are sooo good and it smells good!! Made with truffle oil :) the burger itself was huge and the meat was tender and soft. It's like burger sex in your mouth (don't know how to describe it) lol."}
{"text":"I can honestly say this was one of the best meals I've had in Calgary in 8 years. No, really! I was unprepared for how amazing my meal was! We ended up here on a whim, and I wasn't very hungry. What a fool I was! I order the appetizer size of the butternut squash ravioli, and let me tell you, it was UNREAL how good it was. I want to go back for my birthday! My date had a steak and shrimp combo that was also fantastic - nice seasoning, a bit of a kick, it was a really good steak! I then saw that Cactus Club menu designer Matt Stowe is on Top Chef Canada, and he's kicking @ss so far in the season. Matt, based on what I've tasted and what I've seen on the show, I will follow you anywhere :)"}
{"text":"Nice venue. Good vibe. Great food and quick, as they promised.  Had plenty of time to make my afternoon meeting.   Chicken teriyaki bowl was a great choice and recommended by my server. She was so right.   Hope to be back soon."}
{"text":"I'm going to save you a lot of time and tell you exactly what to eat and drink. YOU'RE WELCOME YELPERS.  To eat:  SZECHUAN CHICKEN LETTUCE WRAPS  sweet and spicy szechuan glaze, peanuts, wontons, korean chili sauce, spicy yogurt  To drink:  Cactus Signature Sangria - Red wine, apricot brandy, fresh strawberries + raspberries, Sprite and a splash of Bellini.  Both are incredibly yummy. The lettuce wraps are listed as an appetizer, but they will fill you up like an entree. I'm not messing around folks. The sangria is not only delicious -it's lethal. Don't drink them till you're sick ladies, because you literally will they're so damn tasty."}
{"text":"This is a decent restaurant and my three star rating should not deter one from going here. In fact it is good for business lunches or for after work dinners. We were here on a Monday and only the the second floor area was open, it also has a nice patio .   I ordered the tuna club sandwich was consisted of a rare steak tuna with bacon, arugula, and a aioli. It was good but I would perhaps have given it a four star if the tuna steak was larger. I have had tuna steak burgers at another restaurant in Toronto and the cut of the fish was much larger and very delicious. The sandwich here was still good I would rate it a 3.5.  The service at this place was also good! I liked the blue dresses for the hostesses which was a nice change from the traditional black outfits."}
{"text":"Very hip. The average age 20-30, great/fun music. Food was amazing!!!  had the raviolis, tuna stack, and truffle fries."}
{"text":"Well first I must say that my prior experiences at Cactus in BC and at this location have been amazing....this last one, however, was just adequate. I arrived early to reserve a table for 3, to be told that they cannot provide wait times for either the patio or rooms upstairs, or the floor level patio, but there was a 30-45 min wait for the room downstairs. To note, I had called ahead to make reservations, but was told that given the dinner rush they were unable to take reservations. However, the hostess kept asking the customers around me if they had reservations, so I'm not sure of what their policies are exactly. Nevertheless, we were put on the wait list for the patio and given the fancy paging gadget.  I arrived with a friend of mine and we seated ourselves at the bar (although no one had advised us to do so), and we waited for our friend. The servers at the bar were very attentive during our lengthy wait at the bar, although none of us were drinking on this particular occasion.  We eventually gave up waiting for a table on the patio and asked for the next available table. Unfortunately, we ended up waiting almost an hour and a half on a weekday evening for any table (besides the bar). We did end up on the ground-level outdoor seating, which was very pleasant overall.  My friends ordered the garden burger with yam fries, and the fish tacos with fries, and I ordered the exact same meal I order every time I have dined here - the Butternut Squash Soup and the Tuna Tataki, although I have tried many dishes ordered by my dining companions as well. The soup was amazing, but the tuna was overcooked and limp...and instead of using the chopsticks provided, I actually had to fork/knife the overcooked tuna. I was unimpressed.  The service was attentive and our service was polite and did accommodate our substitutions and requests; however, there was no mention of any drink or meal specials for the evening (although we were given the menu).  I really do like Cactus Club Cafe and will likely come here again for the lively atmosphere; however, on this particular occasion, I was less than impressed on the wait time (on a weekday no less), and the quality of the meal. I have noticed a difference between the quality of the same menu items between BC and Ontario, and if I dine here again, I would choose other menu options."}
{"text":"I've been a regular at the Cactus Club since the days of the rubber chicken. For those that don't understand, back in the early 90's the Cactus Club restaurant theme was well barnyard. Cows, rubber chickens, I almost remember hay on the wood floors?! lol   University friends and I would drop in between classes for a bite. Good times.  Fast forward to the present and it's wonderful to see this restaurant still here and competing with the best of them. I've watched their themes change over the years, but one thing that has remained consistent is the food never disappoints. Bringing on Rob Feenie to lead the troupes, was also a clever move.  Hubs and I stopped in for a quick one hour lunch date while the kiddos were at activities. Service was prompt, food portions ginormous and satisfying. We were in and out in an hour.  Many reasons to keep coming back."}
{"text":"I get that this place is faltering in the suave after work crowd with King Taps opening recently.  Service is decent, but the crowd is 90% douchebags or 905-ers.  If you can get past the irritating clientele, the food is quite good and they have some interesting cocktails on the menu.  I'd recommend for the 2nd floor dining room, since people who frolic to the roof for happy hour may make you want to jump off."}
{"text":"Came here for a girls night out. The hosts were friendly and so was our waiter.  Not only was the service good but the food as well. My meal was filling and delicious. The best part of this restaurant are the washrooms. The design and structure was amazing. PS. It had a couch and a selfie mirror. I would definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Went to the Cactus Club in Toronto for the first time on Wednesday evening (I'd been a few times in BC). The food is always dependable, and honestly very good for a chain restaurant. This visit I shared the tuna stack and the kale chicken ceasar salad which were both tasty and reasonable value in terms of portion size. Service was good and the interior of this location is very nice, lots of interesting lighting and art. We sat upstairs in a booth which was nice - quieter than the downstairs bar and a more relaxed atmosphere.  One strange things about the other night is that we were quoted a wait time of 30-40 minutes but were actually seated after waiting about 5 minutes. We told the hostess we were going to go elsewhere and asked to remove our name from the wait list, she then told us we were next in line for a table, and a few seconds later a table came up. Not sure why we were quoted such an inaccurate wait time, I'm glad we didn't leave!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend to go for apps and drinks. we sat up top on the roof deck, I loved all the staff (granted some were from Vancouver and helping with the transition) but all super friendly and had a noticeable team dynamic. Tried the calamari, which I would order again 100%. The kale salad and jambalaya were decent but didn't blow me away."}
{"text":"Came here for a late Saturday lunch with my girlfriend.  They were full but it was only a short wait before we were seated.  We decided to try the Potato Skins, the Modern Bowl with Chicken and the Crispy Chicken Sandwich with truffle fries,.  The potato skins were delicious, cheesy and crunchy with a good helping of bacon and perfect with the spicy yogurt sauce.  The Modern Bowl was a bit of a miss for us.  The sauce was way too sour and nothing really went great together although the pieces of the dish were tasty (especially the roasted broccoli and cauliflower).  This felt like they were trying too hard to elevate the trendy \"power bowl\" concept.  The sandwich was solid.  Nice and crispy, although it was impossible to keep it all together and the sandwich fell apart about halfway through.  The truffle fries was the highlight of our lunch.  They were crispy, with lots of truffle oil and cheese that complemented the aioli.  Overall it was some good, some bad.  It's a little pricy for what it is and I could think of better places to spend $60+ on a two person lunch.  Ambience was great and the service was good overall."}
{"text":"As we walked in I was impressed with the decor and atmosphere of the place.  We were seated as per our reservations with out any issues.   The wait staff were really nice but a bit over ambitious with their serving.   1. I ordered a bottle of wine and she began to pour my wine to every guest at the the table without asking.   Even though everyone had their own drink.   Then a manager came by and poured more wine to people that didn't want wine. 2. Another friend of mine ordered a bottle of sparking water and automatically served this to everyone at the table and went through 2 bottles without even confirming who wanted it.  And preceded to bring a 3rd and 4th bottle till we asked her to stop.   Then our orders came perfectly timed and with excellent presentation.  1. Tuna stack was a winner on the items I tried. Good mix of tuna, avocados and panko crisp.  2. Tuna titaki was nothing special. The sauce was out of a jar and they put way too much of such fish.  3. Crispy chicken was nothing special and used a bottled sauce.  4. Calamari was nice and a larger portion compared to the other appetizers.   Entrées were next to follow.   Again waiting the perfect time.  Now this is where the disappointments happened.   Wait staff put most of the dinners in the wrong spot.  And we had to organize our meals.   I had the feature cod fish. The presentation was very nice. The sauce was great with mushrooms and potatoes.   The fish was cooked perfectly not overdone.  But the salt seasoning was way overboard. Every bight I had to wash it down.   The wait staff brought me a second piece and part of it was good and the I had another chunk of salt.  And then I figured out the issue.  The kitchen used either Kosher salt or some sort of rock salt to season off the fish before they sent it out.   If the dish waits for a bit. The salt melts so you don't see it. In my case on the second round I was able to pick off all the chunks of salt off my fish.   My friends that ordered their steaks also complained that they were super salty.   I spent the rest of my night and next morning drinking water to get the salt out of my system.   Unfortunately for $100 per person there are way better restaurants in Toronto.  And the fact that they use a celebrity chef's name is also misleading.    Fortunately I was in good company so the night was saved."}
{"text":"I continue to be impressed by the Cactus Club chain. I've actually never been to this location before, but for our department Christmas dinner, we decided to check it out. Parking was a pain, but there is a big lot, so I'm guessing it depends on what time you go.  We arrived early, so the restaurant wasn't too busy. It filled up throughout the evening though, so I recommend a reservation. The first thing I (unfortunately) noticed was the hostesses skirt - it was MAJORLY short. So short I could see her cheeks as she walked, short. I just hate restaurants where the women are barely dressed (I'm looking at you, JOEY!). It cheapens it and for a place with great food like Cactus Club, they don't need it. Lose the short skirts and I'm sold.  The decor itself is stunning! I love the ambiance, perfect place to unwind after work with cocktails or a for a romantic date night. The patio looked awesome (I LOVE the Buddha) so I'll have to come back in the summer to check it out. We were greeted by the manager who started us off with drinks - super nice guy, but I found him a tad condescending when he was explaining the wine selections. One thing I loved was the sign over the kitchen proclaiming \"HOUSE OF YES\". I realized this is due to them being super flexible and able to pretty much say yes to any request. This was evident when we needed to make a number of substitutions for the dietary restricted. I appreciate how accommodating they are. Also, the washrooms were really nice!  Our server was cute as a button, and DRESSED, which was great. She was very, very helpful in navigating the menu and suggesting alternatives for the above mentioned. You could tell she loved what she did, and she was passionate about the restaurant as a whole. We ordered the Schezuan Green Beans and the Lettuce Wraps to start, both were delicious! I especially loved the Lettuce Wraps, they were full of flavor and the portion was generous - it could have been a meal in itself. The beans were crispy and had a kick - a nice side for an entree, but a bit of an awkward appetizer. For my main, I had the Prawn Spaghetti with a slice of Garlic Toast and it was delicious! I was very impressed to hear that most of their menu is made in house and quite a few items were created by their own Iron Chef, Rob Feenie.   I'm really impressed with the quality of food from a chain restaurant and the excellent service we received. My only complaint are those short skirts, but I will definitely be back to Cactus Club. I just wish there were more locations in town!"}
{"text":"I was in the area with my girlfriend so we decided to have lunch here. Havent eaten at a Cactus Club in ages! We ordered the potato skins to start, they were really good and SUPER crispy. I had the Tuna Club sandwich and it was awesome, but pretty messy. We had a caesar and a bellini each, and they were delicious. I was slighly disappointed that my caesar did not come with all of the garnishes that the picture/menu showed, but it wasnt a big deal. Decent meal and the price was fair. I might be back if I'm in the area, but there are many other restaurants to try first!"}
{"text":"Great place to go! But I am waiting for them to change the menu. Would like to see a different selection of entrees to be on rotation. Same burgers, same sandwiches, same steaks. The service is great and the atmosphere is welcoming. I give love to the calamari! Generous portion with hot peppers and an awesome dipping sauce."}
{"text":"My wife and I dined at the Cactus Club Cafe on Stephen Ave in Calgary this past Sunday. All the staff we interacted with, included our host, our server and a manager were all very pleasant, professional, sharply dressed and very efficient. Our server was very knowledgeable of the menu and helped my wife and I greatly by recommending food selections that were suited to our individual tastes and we both have very different preferences.  The Chicken Wings that we ordered as an appetizer were cooked perfectly and included fresh crisp celery sticks and a house made parmesan ranch sauce, the appetizer was excellent.  My wife ordered the Butternut Squash Ravioli with Prawns for an entree. It was well presented, decadent and rich in flavour. I ordered the Blackened Creole Chicken entree, which was a spicy dish that was very well suited to my tastes. The chicken breast was moist and tender topped with crispy creole seasoned skin and a dollop of creole butter. The creamy mashed potatoes that accompanied this entree were rich and creamy ... to die for!  The food selection and quality of the food items ordered were excellent and well worth the visit. The restaurant is very modern with very nice decor and comfortable seating, making for a very comfortable dining atmosphere. This restaurant is an excellent choice for a business lunch or dinner or anyone who wants a classy dining experience to celebrate a special occasion."}
{"text":"If I could give a 10* I would. This place is insanely delicious. I for the four mushroom steak 9 oz. I'm a big guy and barely finished it. Comes with mashed potatoes and asparagus. Definitely recommend. Staff are super polite and helpful."}
{"text":"Really great experience. We came here with a group of 15 people at 8:30pm on a Thursday night before the Easter Long Weekend, and the service and food were both great.   I had a chance to try the Classic Bellini and the Brazilian along with the Jambalaya Rice Bowl and the Teriyaki Rice Bowl.    The drinks selection was amazing; the Classic Bellini, like most places had a slushie consistency with a fresh peach taste and the Brazilian, which was a kiwi twist on a mojito was definitely the most popular drink at our table - I would definitely recommend trying it!    The Jambalaya Rice Bowl was ok, as I was expecting the mix of meat and veggies to be mixed in with Spanish rice like you would expect in a Paella, but instead they served it over plain rice. So it definitely was not authentic and lacked a bit of flavour. The Teriyaki Rice Bowl, on the other hand was absolutely perfect - it had a mix of chicken & veggies topped with bean sprouts and a tasty mayo sauce, I would highly recommend it.     One unique thing about this place, is the rooftop patio, We went to check it out after our dinner and it turned out to be a great place to lounge and have a few drinks.  They also host a happy hour after 11pm which we definitely took advantage of."}
{"text":"Fantastic food!! And the cocktail are creative and fresh! Get the Cohiba!! The tuna stack was one of the best I've had!!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, awesome food .. Just make sure to reserve your table one week in advance."}
{"text":"Popped by here for drinks before dinner down the street at another restaurant. The atmosphere is definitely hip and the place to be on the weekend. My girlfriends and I sat at the bar, had a couple Moscow Mules on special for Friday. We also ordered calamari since we were hungry and our other reservation was later. Calamari was great, enjoyed the dill dip and chipotle mayo that came with it. We were checked up on a few times by the bartenders so the service was good.   We originally wanted a table but they were booked up. The better option is to sit at the bar while you're waiting for a table. We opted to just stay at the bar as we were leaving. The music was also great and I noticed when we were leaving people were waiting around the bar hoping to grab a seat. I'll definitely be back to grab drinks as its a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Cactus Club is conveniently located in First Canadian Place in the Financial District, so, you always get the hustle and bustle of white collar workers from Monday to Friday.  The interior is very modern and clean, slightly dimmer than I would have preferred as it made me kinda of sleepy after a long day of work. They have a ground floor and second floor patio as well as indoor dining area. The servers are all very attractive people, professional and very friendly; we were constantly checked up on and given water refills.  The food: the menu is seemingly Asian-fusion foods. I got ordered the tuna stack for an appetizer ($16) and had the tuna club ($~16) for my main.  The tuna stack was delicious but slightly salty due to the soy sauce.  The tuna club was nothing special, the ciabatta bread was very greasy and the bottom had become extremely soft due to the sauce and oil soaking through. I changed my fries to truffle fries due to our server's recommendation and they were AMAZING.. especially with the garlic mayo sauce that it came with.  Overall, Cactus Club is a nice to change to your regular Moxies or Jack Astor's... I will be coming back to try more of the items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Mr. A's Famous 5 Point 5 Star Review  Portion: 4 Stars (medium-large. For reference, I'm 6'3\" 215lbs and I left there feeling content.)  Atmosphere: 4 Stars (very nice atmosphere. Best if you can get a table outside near the ave.)  Service: 5 Stars (excellent service. Very nice staff)  Food: 3.5 Stars  (burger was delicious although it was dripping with oil and grease. Plate filled up quickly. Burger was as good as a red robin or cheesecake factory.)  Value: 3 stars (they has conveniently removed happy hour the day that we went. Said it was due to crow sizes from the Calgary stampede. I guess I would have rather tried a more authentic place)  All in all, this is worth a shot if you like that cheesecake factory style burgers. I think I would have rather tried a place that was more authentic to Calgary."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Friday night. Had to wait a bit for a table but that was ok. The place is pummmmmping though - music playing, nice patio, good spot to hang out. The drinks were tasty - tried The Brazilian and the Moscow Mule - both good. Had the steak frites for dinner and my husband had the fried chicken sandwich - both were really well done; the steak was cooked perfectly and the knife cut through like butter. Will definitely come back. My only negative - the server was trying to upsell a little too hard; i know it's her job but ... it starts to get a little bit over the top when everything we ask for, we're offered an upsell."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed grabbing lunch here today. This is my first time in Calgary, and this was a recommendation from a Canadian friend. They had a good variety of menu options, the vibe was great, and the food was good. It seemed to be very popular, as we went in around 1pm and it was very busy.   The vibe is classy...not so classy that you need to dress up, but it definitely feels like an upscale casual place (I know that's kind of an oxymoron, but I think you get what I'm saying). The staff was all very kind and attentive.   I got an arugula salad with salmon. The salmon was excellent and the salad was a great size and really fresh. I was deciding between the salad and the red curry, which also looked amazing and was a chef-designed specialty. I think I would definitely give the red curry a try if I get to go back; it looked so good!  Overall, I really enjoyed my meal and would definitely go back. They looked like they had a solid drink menu as well, although I didn't have the chance to partake. Hopefully next time I'll have a little more time to spare!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food, great atmosphere! Cactus club is always a great option when we find ourselves in Canada! The menu is diverse and has something for everyone, the drinks menu has an extensive range of cocktails, beers and wines (although I find the wine to be a little overpriced) and this particular location has tons of parking. The interior is cozy and a touch romantic with the low lighting (would be a great date location) and they have lots of booths segregated by heavy glass so you don't feel like your sitting on top of other diners or spending the night listening to their conversations. If your spending the night at one of the nearby airport hotels and want a delicious meal that isn't going to cost you an arm and a leg def give Cactus Club a try!!"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant, delicious food and classy design. Drinks are very good. You should definitely try it, If you have ever been in dowtown Toronto."}
{"text":"I would like to share my horrible first experience at the Cactus Club Toronto that occurred on Thursday August 4 at around 9:30pm.  I was out to dinner with a client at Bosk. We had finished a great business dinner and things were going so well, I decided to introduce my client to my fellow coworkers who were having dinner at the Cactus Club. I had messaged her and she advised that 4 of our coworkers had left and there was room at their table located on the upper patio. We walked over to the Cactus Club and there was no line up. We advised the gentleman at the front that we were meeting coworkers on the second floor patio. He advised they were at capacity and to please step to the side. We were the only ones in line, however we obliged. About 10 minutes passed, and I counted 12 people leave the restaurant. I had messaged my coworker and she advised they had room at their table and the upper patio was very empty. I had asked the bouncer again and he said- \"we are at capacity, you will have to wait\". At this time, there were numerous tables on the outside patio that were unoccupied. My coworker came down to speak to the bouncer and they would not let her out to speak to us. The hostess in a blue dress advised her that they could not let anyone in until some people left. At this point, there were 3 people in line. A group of 5 scantily clad women came up to the male \"bouncer\" and asked asked for a table of 5. He asked if they had a reservation. They said \"no, but c'mon, let us in- we promise we'll have dinner\" at which point he grabbed one of their hands, smirked, and said \"come with me\". I politely asked the bouncer when he returned for a time frame of how much longer it would be for 2 people (since numerous people had left by this time and 5 girls who clearly stated they had no reservation were taken by the hand and let in) and ever so dismissively without even looking at either one of us said \"we are at capacity at the moment\" and walked away. At no point in time did anyone offer to accommodate us to a different table that may have been available at a different part of the restaurant, or at the bar when clearly there was enough room to accommodate 5. My coworker who was still waiting at the door was asked by the hostess to please go back to her table as she could not stand at the door. At this point, my client and I returned to Bosk where the service was excellent. My coworkers who were at the Cactus Club left as well and joined us at a place where we were all graciously welcomed.  I have never been to the Cactus Club, however this is not the first time I have heard about their horrible service at the door. Like anything, you take the criticism with a grain of salt as you are unaware of the whole situation. However, you have 2 professionals who were polite and obliging being treated so poorly was completely unacceptable. I can guarantee that neither my coworkers or clients will ever attend the Cactus Club in Toronto. I am also the event coordinator for my office building and will also guarantee that I will be informing them at our next board meeting of the poor treatment that was received and we will never attend the Cactus Club in Toronto.   Your front staff give first impressions of your establishment and I highly recommend better training or hiring is enforced."}
{"text":"First off, if I had seen the review below and knew that they have a gorilla bouncer who treats customers badly I would never go there. Bouncers I suppose could be failed security guards. Security guards are failed cops and of course cops are the high school bullies, but I digress.  My friend and I went down to Cactus Club because we knew them from Vancouver. The menu is different here... The limited choice was disappointing because I never order pasta or hamburgers. They are so ordinary. I settled for the Tuna Club Sandwich and I was surprised how good it was. It was still semi-raw and only seared as tuna is supposed to be, but whatever they did to it that sandwich was delicious. The bun was firm and fresh. The side salad was tasty and aesthetically pleasing. This was much better compared to the bare bones lazy salad at Drake One Fifty a couple of weeks ago.  The waitress Sabrina was not quite a super model, but a model I suppose. She got a full tip from us because she had zero attitude nada. I usually enjoy not tipping much for attitude queens, but there was none of that here.  The staff wear violet uniforms, which matches the '60s-inspired bulbs hanging from the ceiling on top of the bar (I had imagined a more modern decor), but otherwise this is an elegant and tasteful restaurant.  The suit and tie crowd was all over this place. I have no idea why men still wear ties. I mean it is like a leash and so 1984. Still, to each his own, I guess.  The food was tasty, the service was nice (including the hostess who was friendly while we waited a couple of minutes to be seated) and we did not come across a bouncer either!!  I only deducted a point because the menu needs a flair. A staff member dropped a few dishes and there was a moment of gasps, but all in all CC is a return visit option for sure - even a step above their sister restaurant across the street."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night in a group of 5. Hostess told us it might take an hour to wait but we only ended up waiting for almost half an hour and this was at 6:30pm. Place is amazing. We were seated on the top floor and there were heaters that I didnt really enjoy because it felt like it was just blowing on my face the whole time. Perhaps I'm just not used to it.   Now we get to the food. Ordered the famous ravioli. Quite disappointed. The ravioli was good but the shrimp was salty. I ended up passing it to my friend because he really likes seafood.   Overall this place is just perfect for socializing. I would come back and try the other stuff but I wont be as excited since the ravioli was already a let down."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for dinner and drinks had a great time food was good service was good atmosphere was great. I will be coming back and will be recommending this place to others whenever I can."}
{"text":"Cactus club café was a hot spot as soon as it opened and quickly became a place to go to see and be seen, which prompted my original assumption about the restaurant to be mediocre food and service. To my surprise, Cactus Club Café is anything but mediocre. The restaurant itself is quite large with three floors in total. The ground floor has an outdoor patio and a bar/dining area that is more casual. Upstairs on the second floor is the dining room to the right and another bar/dining area to the left and finally the third floor is the stunning rooftop patio and dining space. If you are looking for an evening where you can enjoy a conversation without yelling, then I recommend requesting sitting in the dining room. The other areas are just as enjoyable but are louder and livelier. Now onto the food. The food is simply delicious and consistent. Every dish is seasoned perfectly and executed flawlessly. The calamari appetizer is lightly battered and fried. The calamari is soft and tender with no hint of grease and is served with a dill tzatziki and chipotle aioli. The ravioli and prawn trio is a must try! The tender pasta is stuffed with a delightful butternut squash and mascarpone puree and is topped with a butter sautéed prawn and fried sage, all covered in a truffle butter sauce. This dish is a perfect example of the skill of the kitchen. For mains, any of the steak options are delicious and consistent. The steak is cooked and seasoned as requested. The short ribs are soft and tender with no knife required! Another stand out dish is the Teriyaki chicken rice bowl. I was hesitant to order such a dish at this restaurant but it was delicious and well worth trying. The flavors are bold without being overpowering and the spicy yogurt adds just the right amount of spice without killing your taste buds. What really makes this restaurant stand out is the service. The staff are motivated, friendly, attentive and most importantly consistent. The attention to detail, from the quick clearing of plates, to refilling your water and pouring your wine, is done flawlessly that it goes unnoticed. I have been to several \"high end\" restaurants in Toronto but none have provided the same level and consistency in service. Overall, Cactus Club Café is a wonderful addition to the Toronto culinary scene and I highly recommend to anyone looking for a great night out!"}
{"text":"Thur March 15 around 9pm, Went to the rooftop bar while waiting for our table to be ready. 2 female bartenders one blonde one brunette. We ordered one vodka neat, one gin water bar lime. Please tell me how the girl ended up giving us 2 vodka sodas instead??..... I took a sip and noticed it was wrong but I don't like being annoying at bars so just kept quiet. I handed her a $20 bill and she gave me back 25 cents plus the bill. It read \"2 STOLI\"... are you kidding me? Not only did you get the order wrong, you charged us for two premiums =$19.75. When I can clearly see bar rail Smirnoff and Gordon's gin on your rail. Standard bar practice is to use bar rail unless premium is specified. Walked away, whatever. Then at the table, the kind server informed us that it is $9 single grey goose or $14 for a double. So basically the bartenders upstairs either purposely gave us someone else's bill and kept the remaining money for themselves.. or punched in premium stoli but poured rail without us noticing, and also kept the remaining $ for themselves. Managers be aware whatever scheme your bartenders are pulling to make extra money, especially because they use free pour. Absolutely disgusted at this situation, and it's sad because I love that place. After being ripped off, I doubt I'll return."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed all the food I've ever tried at the Cactus Club, but I enjoy their rice bowls and quesadillas the most.  Oh, and I can't forget the house salad.  The house dressing leaves my mouth watering for more.  Who knew salad dressing could have that effect?  Beyond the food, the Cactus Club serves up a great atmosphere for date night or just a night out with some friends.  Up scale enough to have good taste, yet low key enough to just enjoy yourself, Cactus Club remains on my radar of favourites for lunch, dinner or drinks out."}
{"text":"Three of us enjoyed our steaks even though they all came out closer to medium than the medium rare two of us requested and well done of the other colleague. Food prices are reasonable, service personable and efficient. Not a place to be wowed but no serious flaws and reasonable pricing."}
{"text":"Cactus club, or I would like to call Leah's Palace. The food is great and we go back for the jambalaya. Leah M our waitress from the first floor is always on the ball about our NCAA brackets. Could turn up the heat a bit tho."}
{"text":"Nice resto, accommodating staff and good food.  I have been a fan of Chef Rob Feenie since his stint on tv in the 2000s.  I've eaten at Cactus Clubs in Vancouver and in Calgary and each time I leave happy.  Our server was a bit awkward, but I'm sure with time he'll polish his skills."}
{"text":"Best Bellini and i've had a Bellini in every bar restaurant i walk in. Calamari is a must have food isn't that great but in the same block just fo to their partners King Taps they have great food. Cactus club has a nice Patio and delicious desserts. Their menu and always updated thats the best part about returning. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I had lunch today at the Cactus Club Cafe in First Canadian Place.  It was a busy spot and I was seated on \"The Deck\", on the third floor, which is covered and heated.  I ordered Rob's Crispy Chicken Sandwich (with no cheese, lettuce or onions).  It was a good sandwich.  The bun was really soft.  I didn't find the sandwich overly spicy but it was messy (thank goodness for the large napkin!).  The fries were good too.  I'd get this again.  Rochelle was my server and she took good care of me."}
{"text":"Saturday night at cactus club is a SCENE!! It's the who's who of Toronto. I almost laughed out loud when they made you wait in a line like at a club to get in.   I'm a huge fan of their cocktails , we had several whiskey sours , some caesars, beers and froze. All were pretty darn good.   I still haven't been WOWED by their food.... I've been here a few times and I never walked out saying this was the best meal ever. Last nights dishes were ok. Robs flatbread was the STAR while the tuna tower was meh.... And for dessert the peanut butter bar was awesome!!!   I must say , their service is impeccable and the staff are friendly and attentive.   This will continue to be a hot spot for the GTA."}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere, the servers are pleasant and always have great suggestions for new things to try. The Lettuce Wraps are always a great starter and the drinks are well balanced. Coming from the states, this a welcomed place to dine....."}
{"text":"Hell's Yes!  Went here for business and was very impressed with the offerings they had here. We ate so well that we just ate as many appetizers as possible. High quality food and IMPECCABLE service.  I tried each of the following.  Tuna Tataki Tuna Stack Mini Burgers Calamari Yam Fries Spicy Chicken Caramel Chocolate Mousse  Everything was well described and fulfilled on each promise we were given by the wait staff. If you try anything on the menu, let it be the Caramel Chocolate Mousse.....it is to DIE for! (And I don't use that term lightly).  Pricey as hell but well worth it. At least at this place the two go hand in hand."}
{"text":"I love coming to Cactus Club with a group of my girlfriends & this location is especially fantastic! The service is always great here and the menu has something on it for everyone. Fun drink menu as well!"}
{"text":"Walked in on Saturday at 5:30pm , it was already busy but we were seated quickly although I called and reservations were fully booked up for the night.    The service was amazing! A lovely hostess greeted us at the door and was organized on seating. Our waitress was sweet, smiling the whole time and attentive. She refilled hubby's drink without being asked, explained the difference in flavour profiles of the drinks I was interested in and made good genuine chit chat.   Food quality- awesome! I've been here many times over the years since 2007 but never thought to write a review since I only joined Yelp in 2016. I'm catching up!!! I ordered a fish taco and truffle fries with a tuna tataki...they were all delicious!!! Hubby had a salad with extra grilled chicken. He raved about the pecans and that the dressing was not dripping off. It was enough to lightly coat the greens exactly as he likes! We were so full that we had no room to even look at a dessert menu. I've also eaten steak, salmon, and several other items and all were of consistent high quality.   The decor is classy but comfy. No need to dress up beyond jeans a tee unless you want to...noise level can be high as the resto fills up but that adds to the cozy ambience   A solid 5 stars! Keep up the great work!!!"}
{"text":"Can't wait to go back! Excellent creative fusion type menu.  Lettuce wraps are much better than PF Chang. Duck Club is excellent.  Creole Chicken is fantastic.  Very nice atmosphere, much like a night club. Noisy but fun.  Waitresses have the Robert Palmer girl dress code so I did not expect much for service but I was VERY wrong - our waitress was one of the best I have ever had.  Fun place."}
{"text":"Hello Cactus club!!! I've been one month ago and I want to come back! Let's start.. Menu 5 stars. I ordered beef carpaccio it was absolutely amazing, your pan fried capers one marinade onions just killed me.. Steak... FML.. I always ask rare meat and usually got a med rare.. but Your Chef killed me again)) Thank you.My friend ordered Rack of Lamb, it was also good, but too much pesto souce( I've told him, you can order souce on the side))) Atmosphere 5 starts. Nice decor, cute lamps, relaxing ppl) Service 4 stars. We set at the bar, drinking wine and start with apt. We got a wine and the bill as well. I told to bartender, I wanna order main course and I didn't get my apt, why you brought bill now??? She was very professional and answer was, If you order smth else, I'll add in your bill, you can pay after your dinner, because management says that... For me it brings any inconvenience, because after my order water/main/wine, she just change the bill. I was feeling like ,ok you done, go home, we are waiting another customers)) Definitely come back!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to be. The Brazilian Mojito is my go to drink. Also the tuna stack must be tried at least once."}
{"text":"Great stop for the air traveler looking for a good meal and some pretty faces.  I ordered the Millionaires Filet Mignon ($36 - every other meal is lower, all very reasonable) as recomended by another Yelper.  It was very good, but not quite red enough.  Next time, I'll go for medium rare.    But, a very good experience."}
{"text":"1. Truffle fries was delicious!  2. The atmosphere was a plus - great music and nice crowd!  3. The service was a bit slow - even on a weekday! 4. A great place to wind down after a long day at work, catch up with friends, and enjoy the patio during the summer  Overall, I would go back again!"}
{"text":"Had the sliders with side of fries, with Bellini all was great service was great! My friends got fish taco and quesadillas they both loved it and server was very diligent about my friends allergies and vegan requests!! Very happy!"}
{"text":"Wanted to say a quick kudos to our new server Ashleigh she was wonderful thank you for looking after us!"}
{"text":"I am willing to start this off with a 5 star rating even though we had no food here so please read other reviews if you need to know about the food.  We were willing to stand at the bar for drinks so waited only 10 mins outside ;) that's how packed this place was, were let in only after a crowd came out.    Brand spanking new place, long wait outside for walk ins, 3 floors, more like a bar / club scene than a restaurant ambiance, top floor has a retractable roof ... Yes a retractable roof!!! On good weather days this floor promises to be awesome.    Decor is beautiful, but it was so packed, was difficult to see and I had to really pay attention.  Spoke to one of the managers who said it took a few years to build as it was office space before.  Definitely looks transformative.  A franchise from the west coast so people from there would recognize the business model.  Service seemed excellent, we were asked several times if we needed more drinks or needed any help as we were walking around ... like I said, more like a club.    Ground floor n top floors are probably best for drinks, while the middle floor may have lower noise levels for a quieter dinner.  A variety of seating options available.  Will definitely be coming back again and will be spreading the word."}
{"text":"Quintessential Financial District hot-spot. What's yet to be seen is if they have it in them to turn into a regularly packed spot, or if they'll fade like others in the area.  As it stands, good food, good interior, excellent patio, good service, Bay Street crowd. You decide if it's right for you."}
{"text":"The Cactus Club Café is located on 39th Avenue in the NE.  It's near the A&W and Tim Horton's...all of their parking lots are attached.    Since I work pretty close by, the CCC has become the place to go when there is a birthday or some sort of celebration or even...departures.  The CCC gets pretty busy during the lunch hour on the weekdays, so it can be hard to find a parking spot, they do take reservations though and luckily, I can just stroll over. This place always seems like a hit when a group of us go.    I always seem to go back to the same old thing...ravioli + prawn trio.  It's butternut squash ravioli with sautéed jumbo prawns, its pretty small (3 pieces, but sooooo good) so I usually get an order of sweet potato fries to go with it.  The service is always great but sometimes it can be slow (usually because lunch, they are super busy!) The last time I went for a birthday, we got desserts. The birthday girl got free dessert!!  I have a co-worker that raves about the apple galette (warm granny smith apples, cinnamon puff pastry topped with vanilla ice cream and finished with caramel) and she always has to make room for it...I must say, it does look delicious!! For myself, I went with the Key lime pie, freshly squeezed every morning!! (our server told us) and it was phenomenal!  All the desserts look great!  I would definitely recommend the Cactus Club Café, though if you only have an hour lunch on the weekday; it is pretty rushed so you don't have time to socialize much.  I'd suggest go for dinner so you have time to socialize and enjoy everything!!"}
{"text":"Not a bad lil place. Not as big as the ones in Vancouver but still busy with good scenery!"}
{"text":"Great food and service!  One minor incident with my friend occurred. The manager personally introduced himself and promptly corrected it, then followed up to make sure everything was perfect. Very professional and courteous staff from front to management. No complaints whatsoever. Delicious hunter chicken. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday lunch with family. The food was really good but it took a while to come out. Some of our favourite dishes:  - tuna stack: probably our favourite. It had a perfectly balanced taste- nothing was too overpowering. The chips it came with provided the perfect texture for an amazing bite.  - sablefish: the broth that this comes with is soooo good (also made a really good dipping sauce for fries!). The sablefish itself is very smooth and goes well with the asparagus and shiitake mushrooms. However, I did feel like the fingerling potatoes were a bit too mediocre. - Korean short rib: this double braised short rib dish is really good. Presentation was a bit lacking, but the short rib itself was so tender. It came with very rich mashed potatoes and crisp snap peas. One thing though- the sauce may be a bit much for some."}
{"text":"Good experience. Food was good, did not know about happy hour before so this was nice surprise, Brook was nice and helpful. Will come back if in the area"}
{"text":"My most recent visit was another gem. That prawn ravioli is what dreams are made of! Hallelujah! My main dish was the Creole steak & shrimp and it was also divine! The steak cut like butter and was cooked perfectly. The flavor was wow!  Their drinks are also something to write home about. I tried a few frozen cocktails and each one was delish.   Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious. The hostess was so attentive and so were our servers. The drinks were made perfectly not too strong not too cheap. My friend and I ordered signature ceaser and they were so good they tasted exactly bloody Mary's. The ambience is very laid back but classy at the same time. We came for dinner so the lights are dim. We also ordered Moscow miles which we perfectly made. I also ordered the steak with mushrooms and my friend ordered the salmon both were perfectly cooked and prepared."}
{"text":"First visit here on Saturday for a friends birthday. It was very busy (that being it was a Saturday) So my concern was that the service wasn't going to be good, however the service was excellent. She was on top of the tables requests and was really pleasant.   Ordered truffle fries to start. I am really picky when it comes to truffle fries and to be honest these were one of the best ones I've ever had. To be honest, my super picky boyfriend who doesn't like anything other than plain fries and he devoured it.  We both ordered steak, I had the four mushrooms and he had the steak and frites. Even though we ordered it medium rare it was still very chewy and lukewarm. That would probably be the downfall of the meal. However a friend of mine let me try is ravioli and shrimp and it was delicious.  I would come back to get the truffle fries and to try other items on the menu"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. The patio was nice. Service was great. Food was good. Gotta order the tuna stack."}
{"text":"Came back to Cactus Club for my boyfriend's birthday (May 2017). He had never been here and I really wanted him to try it. Boy am I happy I chose to go here.  1) The atmosphere is amazing. There was alive DJ on Friday night that was playing THE best music. The place was packed but it was actually a great!  2) The food was delicious! I ordered steak frites but with a filet mignon upgrade. The meat was cooked to absolute perfection. I'm drooling just thinking about it. My boyfriend had the duck entree that he devoured very quickly. Before the mains we also had the tuna stack and the calamari. The calamari plate is HUGE. Definitely great to share.   3) The drinks were great. I ordered the passionfruit Bellini and my boyfriend had beers.   4) The service was superb. Our waitress was so great. She made sure that our evening went smoothly. When I mentioned that we were there for a birthday, she brought out a little dessert on the house. Even that was delicious and made the night that much nicer.   I will definitely keep coming back Cactus!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere Packed on a Saturday evening - limited space at the bar before they setup our table. GOod ambiance with good music selection playing in the background. We were eventually seated on the 2nd floor which was also packed.    Food The tuna stack, ceviche, truffle fries were delicious. They definitely do the apps better than their mains. The steaks were horrible - the four mushroom sirloin and the steak frites were chewy and not seasoned. Similar story with the burgers as well. The other guests enjoyed their double braised short ribs and the hunter chicken.  Drinks Decent drinks, nothing special.  Overall I've had better in a similar price range. Probably won't return."}
{"text":"I give it one star for a couple of reasons. First cactus has been around long enough to know better than to blow a service this badly. Especially in Toronto which has far less tolerance for crap service then British Columbia.   They get one star because my meal was comped. The meal was cold which sucks when it happens but it happens, but the issue was I sat there for another 15 minutes, wishing I was one of the two servers iPhones.   I decided to close the bill right there, and that's when I found out my meal had been comped. I finished up, grabbed the bill, put my card on top of that and then spent another 15 minutes wishing I was either the phone or the new friend sitting right beside me that clearly worked for a restaurant and was given the attention of both bartenders and the manager while she selected a bottle of rose.   Finally someone noticed and checked me out. At that point I was one of four people at a bar that seats 25, just to put it in perspective, and it was 10 o'clock at night. Perhaps I just got the B team tonight.  Now at AAA, at the bar, which is packed, with a glass of wine in hand in less than a min."}
{"text":"The three stars in this review is only for the atmosphere of the restaurant. I had ordered chicken teriyaki and it made me want to not ever like food again. Please be careful what you choose to eat. good luck!"}
{"text":"Came here with my fiancé and a few friends for a Saturday night catch up. The ambience is nice and classy. The drinks menu is pretty diverse - you'll find something for you whether you're a wine, beer, or cocktails drinker. I'd definitely come here again for a fine date night with le fiancé!"}
{"text":"Fantastic dinner spot in the heart of Toronto; my group came in on a very rainy night but we were seated promptly (make sure you make a reservation to skip the waiting lines)!!  From the minute we were seated, the waitress, Holly (such a sweetheart), provided prompt service and hearty recommendations about cocktails, beers, and dinner selections. Provided awesome service throughout the night even partaking in our colorful humor.   Food was excellent all around the table (fish, chicken, steaks); if you start off with appetizers, make sure to order the truffle fries - in one word, FANTASTIC. We ordered five!!  The mood and the lighting were akin to its very swanky atmosphere; low light (which may not be good for pictures but still provided good ambiance.)  Great spot, if I could rate it 6 stars on yelp, I would. And ask for Holly to provide service!!!"}
{"text":"First visit.  Just had apps and drinks.  Everything was amazing.  Staff went over and above to make sure we had a good time.  Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Great meal.  Small and busy place.  Great food topped off with the best service we have jas in a while shout out to our waiter mark"}
{"text":"Came here at lunch and it was packed!  We sat at the bar which is first come first serve while the rest of the restaurant was fully booked.   Cactus is definitely the place to be at for a work lunch in the financial district. It's buzzing with very efficient service at a decent price.  I ordered the Cajun chicken sandwich with fries.  It was decent but I felt like they can do better. The chicken breast was lightly seasoned and was accompanied by iceberg lettuce and slice of tomatoes inside a hamburger bun. The taste of the sandwich would have been enhanced if it had a more distinct sauce like a Cajun mayo or chipotle sauce would have been better than just plain mayo."}
{"text":"Easily the most consistent dining experience in town. Very rarely ever varies ...food is always top notch, servers are excellent. I can never pass up the beef carpaccio or the butternut squash ravioli....great every time. My only complaint would be that it gets really busy and it's tough to get a seat around lunchtime. Word gets around pretty fast, so I don't expect the crowds to go down anytime soon. Great job, Cactus.....highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This place was jumping during weekday lunch. Great atmosphere that makes you feel way cooler than you actually are. Solid beer list. Had lunch at the bar. Friendly service even though it was very busy. The fish tacos are recommended."}
{"text":"Awesome food, staff and environment. I had the chicken burger and it was pretty good. If you are looking for a place for a date or you are in town for business I highly suggest this place."}
{"text":"Must try: Butternut Squash Ravioli with Prawns  Been here a few times for work and the food and service are always pretty consistent. Make sure to book a reservation as the place fills up for days in advance.  For appetizers, the butternut squash soup is good, as well as the truffle fries. The calamari is also a good portion and the flatbread is a good veggie options.  For mains, I almost always get the ravioli, the last time I went it was a bit overly sweet (maybe squash is in season)? Only thing is it gets a little heavy when it's too sweet. If you are not into sweet things, or pasta dishes, there are other options too like burgers or others entrees.  Dessert was alright, and the drinks were pretty and yummy too."}
{"text":"I first went to a Cactus Club in BC, and I'm happy to see that we have them here now! I came here for lunch on a couple of occasions while downtown for business and this place is always RAMMED. My colleague knew this place pretty well so we came in the less busier entrance (I think we were downstairs?) and were seated immediately.  The decor and ambiance in the restaurant was great. It was a little loud, and tables felt a little cramped BUT it's because this place was packed - and I can't fault a place for being popular. Prices are very reasonable - almost a bit lower than I was expecting..  As for what I had...well, I had the chicken fingers. Both times. I'm sorry. I wish I could have had something exciting so that I could rave about how amazing it was, but I must say I was pretty damn happy with my fingers and fries! What can I say...I'm 9 years old at heart.   This will be on my short list of places to eat when I'm downtown. I'd definitely go back...and maybe be a bit more daring with my menu choices...but no promises!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in ages and finally went for dinner with a group last night.  There were too many \"What the...\" or \"Really?\" moments for me to give Cactus Club any more than 3 stars.     Our server told me that the Margaritas on special cost less than $6, so I was deflated when the bill said it was $7.25.  I was also expecting a slushy beverage but instead it was served in a highball glass with ice cubes.  The raspberry flavor was very weak so I had to get that fixed.  Disappointing.  I ordered the Spinach Salad and the amount of greens on the plate was considerably less than anticipated.  It was loaded with huge beets, which is fine with me, but if someone didn't like them, this salad would be a total rip off.  I added grilled chicken for $5 and I'd be shocked if they gave me 3 ounces.  Again, disappointed.  This salad was good, but definitely not worth $21.  I'm no longer excited about this place and wouldn't go back by choice, even though I've never had a complaint about the taste of the food."}
{"text":"Don't like to eat at chains but this shows how fresh food and a top notch experience does not have to come just from an owner operator establishment. We had the salmon which was fantastic as well as the calamari.  Would highly recommend ."}
{"text":"Came here with 2 friends for Summerlicious dinner ($38 for 3 courses). We weren't able to reserve a table since Thursdays were usually their busiest night, according to the employee on the phone. But we went anyways and waited 1.5h for a patio table. The music was good and our server was friendly. Although we did get the feeling she was trying to rush us out towards the end of our dinner.   For drinks, we ordered the Frosé and Bellini. They were sweet and refreshing, but a bit too strong. Usually this is not a bad thing, but it had a bite to it that didn't mix well with the food. I would probably try them again, if I went for drinks only.  For appetizers we tried the mini tuna stack and ravioli duo, which were both delicious and tasty. We also ordered calamari (from the regular menu) which had a large portion size. We liked all the appetizers, but the ravioli was definitely the best among them all!  For our entrées, we ordered the ravioli (came without prawns), port wine salmon and peppercorn sirloin. My steak was over cooked, so it was quite rubbery and difficult to chew/swallow. But the mashed potatoes that came with the steak made up for it with its smooth and buttery goodness. The friend who ordered the salmon said it wasn't anything special. And lastly, the ravioli (even without the prawns) was hands down the best dish of the night!  For dessert, they unfortunately ran out of key lime pie due to popularity. So we ordered the chocolate peanut butter crunch bar and and caramel chocolate mousse instead. If you like chocolate, you should def try the crunch bar. The light mousse + rich caramel combo was exquisite, and came in 2 cute shot glasses.  All in all, I really enjoyed my experience at Cactus Club, and the Summerlicious tasting menu had a good variety to choose from. I do recommend going with a few other people to try more dishes from the menu, and definitely grab a patio table if the weather is nice. I found most of the food we tried to be average, but I would definitely come back here again for the great atmosphere and a few dishes that really stood out --specifically the ravioli!"}
{"text":"Conveniently located by my workplace, cactus is a great place to casually grab some drinks or have a business lunch. Their albacore tuna stack is amazing and I would highly recommend! Fresh cubes of tuna mixed with a tamari vinaigrette layered with creamy avocado and cilantro. It's served with wonton crisps, which acted as a great foil to the tartare.   Cactus also had one of the most diverse drinks menu in Toronto, along with the lounge at shangri la. Usually, I don't enjoy alcohol but I absolutely adore the Wu tang-tini, which is available on the secret menu. Lychee liqueur blended with white cranberry juice and a hit of vodka. Sweet and sour with a strong fruity flavour, perfect for a light weight like myself."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time after a friend recommended it and I was not disappointed.   Atmosphere: fun and social- they have a large bar in the centre of the 2nd floor with a counter top that goes in a giant ring around the bar tenders so there's 360 service. Small tables and booths along the walls with flat screens playing sports games.   Lighting: is low, lit with candle light, can get a bit loud at times, but seems like a fun place for a date.  I would probably put them on the high end of Canadian/American pub fare.. definitely above joeys and earls.  Food: I ordered a kale salad to start and a four mushroom sirloin. I was expecting more from the salad, but it was a good salad nonetheless. Kind of plain but It's a salad. Leaves were fresh and dressing was delicious. The steak was delicious. They over cooked it, but it still tasted amazing. The 4 mushrooms sauce was probably the best I've ever had.. I would go back there just to have this dish. And the mash potato and asparagus accompaniments were perfect.   Drink: wish they had a larger wine list by the glass, but it was decent. They appeared to have a lot of cocktails and beer as week, but I didn't really look  Service: Excellent. It was busy, but we were seated promptly and our server was always smiling and helpful. They had no issues with replacing my steak without me asking and there was no awkwardness after. Our server continued to check on us all the same.   DESSERT: I tried their key lime which I found out later was baked in house and now I want to go back to try the other desserts   This place has definitely won my vote!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Cactus club cafe before Raptors game.   It was convenient from Union Station. We were greeted by young nice ladies at the reception. I thought I will feel awkward as we were wearing   I had short rib papperdelle and it was really good"}
{"text":"Came here a few times in the last 2 years for lunch that weren't too memorable but based on my visit last week, there were definitely a few dishes that are worth highlighting.  My friend and I started with Tuna Stack and the Ravioli & Prawn Trio.   Tuna Stack was perfectly presented, ahi tuna mixed with avocado drizzled with citrus vinaigrette was absolutely delicious.  This was so good that I could've easily had 2 of these myself.  The Ravioli was nice too but for 3 pieces for $16, it was not really worth it.  We also shared the modern bowl which is a mix of tabbouleh, roasted cauliflower, broccoli, pineapple salsa, rice with a miso carrot ginger sauce with the option of grilled chicken, glazed salmon or grilled avocado.  We picked the glazed salmon which was very nicely done.  Although we enjoyed this rice bowl, the flavouring of the mixed of ingredients were a bit lacking in taste.  The service was great and loved the atmosphere on the rooftop.  All in all, we enjoyed our visit."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Cactus Club for awhile now, but could never get reservations! So for my birthday I was finally able to go by booking 2 weeks in advance :)   I had an incredible birthday dinner! The atmosphere is absolutely gorgeous - very classy and upscale with three different floors. Even at 5:45 on a Tuesday this place was packed!   The service was wonderful and they also had bellinis on special for $6! Best bellinis I've had!   My friends and I split the flatbread which was delicious and I got the butternut squash ravioli as my main. The truffle butter made it incredible!!! I could've gone back tonight again just for more of the ravioli :)   I'm so excited to come back to this place!! Would highly recommend for a birthday or classy dinner!"}
{"text":"I have been a few times and while the food is delicious that is all that is good about this place. The food is overpriced (but expected in the financial district) and service is just bad.   On the most recent visit, we had booked online for a party of 6. The online booking does not allow us to make note of special requests, like baby high chair required. When we got there they sent us to the rooftop patio, which is adults only. When we mentioned the baby, they then had to scramble to find another table for us. 5 minutes later they sent us down the elevator to the main level and said \"someone will meet you at the elevators to take you to your table\". We waited. 5 minutes later, it is evident no one is coming and none of the servers walking about care to ask what we are waiting for. We go back to the front desk and ask what is going on.  Front desk informs us that they are still waiting for a table to clear up. So why not just tell us to go back to the front to wait? Why the whole charade about waiting by the elevator? Ugh. 5 minutes later, table is still being cleaned up. 5 more minutes later. We are finally taken to our table (20 minutes after our actual reservation time, if you are keeping track).  One of the people in our party had to rush their lunch to make it out in time for a meeting. To the kitchen's credit, they did accommodate for the rush order, her food came first, and she made it out in time.  I ordered the new poke bowl, but asked for edamame to be taken out. I asked if they could sub something else instead, and they said it would cost extra. But its not like I got a discount for taking out the edamame. So I was not impressed with the lack of flexibility. Most other places would offer you something for this price.  The poke was good. Nothing amazing, but still tasty. Serving size was average. You will not have leftovers.  When we wanted to get the bill, it was well after the lunch rush and the server kept dissapearing on us, so we had a hard time getting her to get our bills so we could leave.  Overall, I would say this place is just ok. Service is hit or miss, and after this last time with the table mix up and lack of flexibility in making substitutions, I don't think I will be going back. For the price, I can get tasty food elsewhere and receive much better service."}
{"text":"I am going to give this new place a coveted 5 star rating on the food, service, and ambience. Lets start with the food, the menu has something for everyone (including staples like sliders, calamari and sweet potato fries) The service is great and the servers and bartenders are very friendly and attentive (which can be hard to do especially when the they are constantly busy) and the vibe of this place is hip and trendy. This is a great place for Yuppies to take the edge off a long week, to spend some quality time with friends, and is a great place to take a date as well. Prices are inline with other establishments in this hood and remember if you receive exceptional services here, give your servers 20%, I am definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"We stopped by without a reservation around 8:00pm on a Saturday night. There was an approximately 1-hour long wait with the option to sit in a lounge or bar on one of the three floors of the restaurant, and we opted to venture to each floor in search of seating. With little available for two to sit together at the bar, we wandered around and a server eventually offered us a reserved table under the condition we leave before the reservation - done! We had the limited late-night menu, and there weren't many vegan or vegetarian options, but they ended up turning their chicken lettuce wraps into veggie patty wraps with the party done up like their chicken in a spicy peanut sauce. It was great! Drinks were also good. Expensive bill, but that happens when your dining partner orders the 12oz sirloin option. Not a fan of how loud it was but it worked for those watching the game and pre-gaming before the clubs, I'm sure!"}
{"text":"Honestly, this place is very typical - an archetypal Financial District restaurant. It's dark and \"sexy\" with low lighting, always busy and buzzing with banker people, with slightly slow service (not at the fault of the servers at all) and slightly expensive menu items.   However...have I ever NOT enjoyed my meal here? No. It's consistently pretty good. The lettuce wraps are very tasty (a must try), the portions are generous and there's basically something for everyone on this menu.   Is this restaurant unique and innovative? Not at all.   Will it totally blow your mind and give you a robust and interesting culinary experience? Definitely not.   But is it good for what it is? Totally!   If you want something easy, well located, consistently pretty tasty and not TOO uncomfortably expensive (but not cheap)...go here.   Also good for grown up birthday parties! :)"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with my co-workers and ordered the following:  - Butternut Squash Ravioli With Prawns: although the serving size looks a bit small (7 pieces of ravioli), the dish is rather filling. The ravioli melts in your mouth especially with the crispy sage but the dish could go without the prawns. It was nice to try it, but would not order again for $30 - The Bellini: looks as amazing as it tastes and has the perfect balance of peach and rum/sangria  Service was a bit slow, but it was lunchtime and fairly busy (I would recommend making a reservation for lunch).  I found the food menu to be a bit limited with nothing that really stood out, but I would definitely come back here for drinks!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Service left a lot to be desired though. Waitress didn't ask what side I wanted with my sandwich. She didn't ask if we needed cream or sugar for our coffee. One member of our party didn't get his drink so we had to ask about it 10 minutes after it had been ordered. We were informed at the end of our meal that their computer system went down so we had to wait 5 minutes for our bill. Throughout the whole meal the manager had to offer apologies at every table near us as well so it wasn't just us who were disappointed."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Saturday with a group of 6. Service was excellent and so was the food. I've had bad service at another cactus club location in NE Calgary so this McLeod Tr location was far superior."}
{"text":"Everything you heard here is true! The food is incredible and the vibe is fun.   For starters we had the Tuna stack and it was absolutely delicious. So much flavour and really fresh. Would definitely recommend to others as a sharing appetizer. For mains I got the steak frites and it was made to perfection. The steak was juicy and perfectly seared. I paid an extra $12 to upgrade to a 12oz strip loin instead of regular 7oz. The fries were okay, I prefer them thinner and crunchy. My girlfriend got the butternut squash ravioli and it was so good. The truffle sauce is sweet and savoury, and adding the pine nuts gave it extra crunch for an amazing texture contrast. For drinks we got the Tuesday special: Bellini's for $6!   We came on a Tuesday night and it was packed, waited 30 mins for a table. You definitely need to make a reservation to avoid waiting.   The only reason I'm giving it a four instead of five stars is because the tables were too close to each other. The table next to us kept hitting our table and  the man next to us knocked my phone off the table. Other than that everything was 5 stars: food, service and ambiance."}
{"text":"Cactus Cafe is located downtown and can be access through the path without going outside. Been here quite a few time for personal and business meals. When it first opened it was crazy busy and you had to make reservations 2 weeks in advanced. Now that there are several new restaurants opened in the area it has slow down.  Except in the evenings when business people  come for after work drinks.  This is my first review. Of all my experience I would give Cactus Club Cafe a 4 star.  The service is always consistent.  A few favourite appetizers I've tried is the calamari, good and tasty. Chicken wings are small and dry.  The shrimp ravioli is amazing. Lettuce wrap is also great! I've tried most of the main dishes.  The short ribs pappardelle with arugula is great.  This was the dish in the picture attached.  I love their specials. I had the pineapple and hoisin beef short Ribs with with snow peas and mash potatoes.  It's was amazing a must have. Their spicy chicken sandwich is great, salmon is great. Also I had their duck sandwich it was amazing. All in all great experience here."}
{"text":"It's amazing how consistent Cactus Club is with their food. I would go to Cactus almost every week in Vancouver, especially during the summer.  My favourites are the chicken lettuce wraps, calamari, sliders, quesadillas, and bellinis.  Atmosphere here is always a blast. It can get really loud during peak times (especially Thursdays after work). I would avoid sitting at or by the bar if you're plan to have deep conversations."}
{"text":"Nice scene had a good DJ on and true food was great, the Calamari and Flatbread are suggested appetizers! Drinks were weak but all and all nice place"}
{"text":"One of my all time favourite restaurants located downtown. The steak is to die for and the cocktails are well done. This place offers weekday happy hours with drink specials everyday. The restaurant has a great vibe with good crowd and music!"}
{"text":"Nice social spot for after work drinks. Somewhat trendy and a new regular spot for a lot of the Bay Street crowd. The food was pretty standard for this style of restaurant,  but that isn't a bad thing if you know what your looking for."}
{"text":"Service: I went to Cactus Club last Friday for my birthday and had the best time! We had a party of 15. Our server Kathleen was AMAZING. Be bought a few bottles of wine for the table and she was very prompt in filling up everyone's glasses and making sure people were enjoying their entrees. A lot of times servers are frustrated with large groups and you can feel slightly neglected. This was not the case with Kathleen, she introduced herself, engaged with everyone and even reminded people that gratuities were included on the bill and that they shouldn't double tip. She was also prompt in bring out my two cakes, complete with the sparklers. Also, it should be noted that there is NO CAKE CUTTING FEE HERE; which is fantastic. Service was truly amazing and I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking to book for a large party.    Food: I had the Hunters Chicken as well as the ravioli and tasted the duck and chicken sandwich. Everything was delicious. Wine selection was great too!"}
{"text":"Great cocktails!!.. And the food was really good as well!!.. I liked everything I had here!.. The desserts were also delicious!!... The key lime pie was extraordinary and the chocolate Vulcan was great too... Even when I am not a chocolate person I loved it... I definitely would like to go back there to try the different cocktails they have... And other main dishes.. I had the lingcod and it was delicious... All the people on my table loved their main dishes as well.."}
{"text":"Delicious food!!!!! Tuna stack and shrimp ravioli are my favorite!  if you come around 5pm there is no wait to get in. They only have a few tables open for reservations. The rest are walk in"}
{"text":"I have never had such a horrible experience at a restaurant before. the staff as well as the management are horrible! We get there at 9 we were told 1-1.5 hr wait. We stated we had no issues being split up since we were a group of 12. We waited for over 3 hours to be seated! Do NOT go to this place if you have a large group! They are disrespectful!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! The drinks are well priced and the atmosphere is always good. I went here for Toronto Summerlicious, and had a 3 course meal for 35$. The prawn butternut squash ravioli was amazing, and the butter sauce it came with was so good. I had the hunters chicken with vegetables and the  portion size was so big I couldn't finish it. The desert was a butterscotch caramel pudding which was amazing. I had the Caesar - spicier than most, but really good. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"After trying forever to get into this place for dinner, I'm pretty happy to say that we were fortunate enough to get a table during lunch without reservations. We walked in around 11:30 and the place was surprisingly pretty full. We had a party of 5 and the booths had plenty of room. We ordered a calamari and edamame to start, which were both great but perhaps a little bit too generous with the salt on the edamame.  I ordered the butternut squash ravioli with prawns as my main, and it was GOOOOD. I had the entire main for myself and despite initially thinking that the portion was small (they gave me 7 pieces of ravioli lol), I feel that it would've been better to split with someone because of its full and rich flavour. Maybe it was also the appetizers before our mains, but I was done after the 5th piece. I liked the combo of the butternut squash with the prawns because the taste of the ravioli alone would've been too one dimensional. Great dish that I would order again.   Service was also amazing and our waters were topped quite frequently. They also gave us new cutlery after our appetizers.... Very attentive! Our waitress was also so kind and polite. Overall, I would definitely come again! But it's not worth the 1.5h dinner table wait."}
{"text":"Nice casual place. The staff were really friendly and helpful. Our food came out really fast which was great as were starving. Really liked the lobster roll. The paella needed a bit more seasoning but still good. They had great drink options too"}
{"text":"Went for dinner on Saturday night. Very welcoming, if plastic looking staff at the front door but definitely friendly. The waitress was very friendly and had the right mix of talkative and knowing when to let us eat or chat amongst ourselves, and not be intrusive, yet always seemed to have great timing for when to ask if we wanted more to drink. She definitely knew what she was doing. The food was fantastic, I personally had Rob's hunter chicken and I couldn't have expected better. Everyone thought their food was great. Since it takes something incredibly outstanding or unique for me to give five stars, which is almost impossible from a chain, take this as a fantastic endorsement from me!"}
{"text":"First trip to Calgary and this place a couple minutes from hotel.   It was fantastic. Tyler waited on me and he is great as well.   Returned for lunch two days later and got an amazing bacon cheeseburger. Definitely on my return to ASAP list."}
{"text":"The rooftop deck is intimate with nice decor but can get loud if there are company hosted events there. Really like the drinks menu which had a lot of yummy options. I went for the Frose which was pretty good and tasted like frozen strawberry rose, but may be too sweet for some. I had the Butternut squash ravioli with prawns, which came with pine nuts and crispy sage. It looked like a small portion but was actually quite heavy with the mascarpone and truffle butter. I enjoyed my meal and the drink and would come back to try their other dishes/drinks."}
{"text":"I would just like to inform you that this cactus club location is outstanding. Every time my fiance and I go to this location weather it's for a special occasion or just for a nice dinner out, the food and service always surpasses our expectations.  The food is always extremely tasty and cooked wonderful. And the service is amazing. I would just like to thank the staff at the Barlow location for making my nights out better then planned . Thanks you so much"}
{"text":"I came to this place with some coworkers for lunch and in general it was..., let's say less than enjoyable and the price/value ratio was very low.  In general this place try to have that feeling of modern young professional clientele type of restaurant similar to other in the same line, but this one far from been great.  The Good:  Well we could consider that overall environment it s OK, as it is typical in this kind of ($$ to $$$) restaurant they hire nice girls as waiters, so we may consider it as a plus. The food looks good, very well presented.  The Bad:  1.- The waiter was kind of pushy and I felt like she was annoyed because we had to wait for the entire group to show up to start ordering. 2.- The space was very limited, the space was crammed, and the chairs were not comfortable 3.- The setup to fit eleven of us was poorly done, therefore the waiters had to lean on our shoulders to deliver the food to some of us and using some of us to pass the plates back and forth. 4.- Prices: the meal prices are not great and do not have a lunch menu. 5.- The meal: I ordered a rare tuna sandwich. What I got was a nice looking sandwich with some kind of white fish over cooked outside with some burned parts and way passed rare inside (it did not look or tasted tuna at all). According to the description, in the menu, one of the ingredients was cilantro..., then I though this must be very interesting combination, I found one single leave of cilantro in the sandwich; absolutely disappointing.   The Ugly: After all  the unpleasant experience with my food and the fact that I had to be the waiter's assistant; when the bill came, and I was charge with a drink which I had even ordered and even though I complained about, I ended up giving the remaining change as tip, which I regret to do"}
{"text":"Coming from San Diego, CA where it's always sunny and rooftops are daily things I already kind of knew what to expect going in. However, I was pleasantly surprised.   I came with a friend here to have lunch before I left Toronto. There was a huge line and I'm soo glad my friend knew someone there because we went right upstairs and were seated immediately. (yes to connections! lol)  We came during happy hour and the menu was actually pretty good. We ordered some drinks it was pretty hot. (Frosé, Moscow Mule, The Bellini) The best was the Frosé!!! so refreshing!  We also ordered Lettuce Wraps, Mini Burgers, & Mini Chicken Sandwiches. I loved all of the food. Everything tasted so good. Our waitress even brought extra lettuce and sauces because she saw we needed more.   The service was great. I know I will 100% be coming back here for lunch. So much fun and amazing appetizers!!"}
{"text":"I had a tuna dish and it was terrible. It was dry and poorly seasoned. My girlfriend had some good Parmesan garlic fries and the fish tacos were adequate. The butternut squash soup was good but had some strange green oil slicks on it."}
{"text":"Delicious vegetarian food and great service! Nothing to complain about after being here several times, it's a pretty solid option if you're downtown and looking for some good food and drinks. They're pretty accommodating with dietary restrictions as well.  Edit: The item I got was on their summer menu, but they have a dietary menu for GF/vegetarian for anyone who is curious!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous!! It was a very busy night this Friday and everyone was on their A game.....usually some but not all employees at this location are awesome....it was everyone tonight. We had a bit of a wait and the hostess took our drink orders and brought them while we waited in line, our table was ready before we finished them and she set them at our table and was just super efficient. Our server Jay was amazing and friendly and attentive. We had the tuna tower, dry ribs to start and we split the pineapple short rib (which they plated beautifully spoon swipe and all on separate plates for us). Food amazing, service.....we're still talking about how great it was. Well done Team cactus club!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice. Or tried to be. The first time we were studiously ignored by staff. The food was good but not amazing. The drink I had was good. The second time they didn't have our table ready for the reservation. After fifteen minutes they said it was almost ready, and at our urging asked on the radio if anyone was available to prepare our table. They said again it was almost ready, but after a few minutes we left.  Decent food, Good drinks, terrible service. You can do better in this area."}
{"text":"Short & sweet review because we all already know cactus is the best.   The service here is always good. Let's not forget to mention the drinks! Cocktails on cocktails. Happy hour is too good. Lots of love for cactus."}
{"text":"Great place, with excellent food, fun atmosphere, and friendly service. I tried the Tuna Tataki as an appetizer, and it was outstanding. One of the best I've had. It comes with little chunks of fruit and a citrus sauce, so if you like a little sweet in your food, this is a great choice.   As an entree, I had the Dijon Salmon, and this was also superb. The Dijon sauce was just right, and the salmon was fresh and perfectly cooked. I highly recommend this dish."}
{"text":"Quality food, lovely ambiance, central location and attentive service. The price is leaning on the higher end but definitely reasonable and well worth it. I've been here 4x and I haven't been disappointed by anything in the menu so far. Great place for food or to enjoy drinks with co-workers, SO, or friends. It does get busy in the evenings but I didn't have to wait long for a table for 2 on a weekday night. Even if you have to wait, they have remotes so you can walk around and come back when it flashes. I find it hard to give this place constructive criticism because I think they are overall well managed and catered well to this price range.   Ordered Tuna Stack - I normally like to try new things when I revisit a restaurant but I just had to order this again because it's this good!   Duck Confit - Normally not a huge fan of bacon because it can be sometimes overly salty or greasy but the bacon here definitely paired really well with the lentil base, which absorb the flavours well. The duck was juicy and perfectly cooked.   Short Rib Pappardelle - I tried a couple bites of this. The pasta was pretty good with the mushroom base and it kept me wanting more. But I still prefer the duck confit more.   Overall I find it such a treat and would consider coming back here again."}
{"text":"Went here with 5 other people for a birthday and had a great time! The waiters/waitresses were all very nice, and the atmosphere was really fun! We sat on the third floor patio where a DJ was playing a combination of recent and throwback songs. The music was a little loud, so if you're looking for a quieter place to eat, I'd recommend dining downstairs on the second floor. I ordered the steak frites, the flirtini cocktail, and the chocolate caramel mousse, which were all very delicious! One complaint though is that my steak was a little overcooked (I ordered medium rare but got medium), so it was a little tougher than it should have been. The restaurant was very crowded as well, so I'd recommend reserving a table a week before to get a prime dinner time. Because of how crowded it was, it took a little bit of weaving through the tables to get to the washrooms, which wasn't bad for me, but might've been a struggle for someone bigger than me. If you're the kind of person who likes to blend in, this place is located in the financial district, so you'll find a lot of the people around you will be dressed in business/business casual attire. Overall, I would recommend this place to a friend."}
{"text":"Went here last week for the first time. Great atmosphere, upbeat vibe. Music was AWESOME.  I had the sangria (so good; they add a splash of Bellini slushee...mmm).  Hubby and I had: ceviche (delicious!), salad with chicken schnitzel of some sort (also great)   I ordered steak & prawns and my hubby had fish tacos. Zero complaints. My group also thoroughly enjoyed their food.  I'll be back here for sure.   Loses 1 star for the Saturday night crowd. Meh. (I realize CC can't control this, but it contributes to the overall experience)"}
{"text":"Okay, so I had to write an update about our experience from last night. My boyfriend and I decided to come here for dinner last night. Our original choice was The Keg Mansion, but as it was Family Day, they were closing early. We both thought okay, let's go to Cactus Club and so happy we decided to come here!!  The vibe of this restaurant itself is amazing, as I mentioned before, it is definitely a place to come to catch up with friends after a long time or even celebrate a birthday, anniversary, etc.   The food is AMAZING! I have tried a few items on the menu, however my favourites would be the following: - Calamari  - Peppercorn sirloin  - Creole steak + prawns - Butternut squash ravioli with prawns  I would've gave them 5 stars, but the past few times that I've been here, the service was pretty slow. I mean, the waiters are kind but pretty slow!!  All in all, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best food / execution of all the Canadian \"breastaurants\" (Joey's, Earls, Chop, Moxie's, etc.)  It's a busy place, service is slow, but if you're looking for a good meal in the area, you'll do pretty well here.  Calamari is well-executed with a solid portion and a few sauces.  Flat bread....I think they forgot the \"flat\" part, as the crust was ~3cm thick...skip it.  Main-courses were excellent; presentation and execution were pretty flawless.  I went 9oz sirloin, and without a doubt it was the best cooked steak I've had in the country.  I typically like my steak naked, but the cajun seasoning they use actually works well.    What I can't figure out is the name.  It's not Mexican, it's not a club, and it's definitely not a cafe.  Don't let the name fool you...the menu is designed by an Iron Chef, and the chefs seem to be trained that way as well.   Stop in if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I would have loved to review the food, but we never got the chance.  Went on a Friday after the Raptors game at around 9:30. Hostess told us it would be an hour wait for a table, but we were not super hungry so we went up to the lounge area that is kind of like a club. Went down 1-2 times to ask if our table was ready and was told to be patient. They were busy and we didn't want to be annoying.   We hung out and just had drinks and just never ate. At 1am when leaving, I asked what happened with the table. They apparently didn't activate the table alarm so it never went off when the table was ready. The hostess Nicole was polite but just made a ton of excuses and did not apologize. It's hard to be understanding when the staff screw up and just shrug their shoulders. We would have left to go somewhere else, but they kept saying we just had to wait until finally it was 1am and restaurant was dead.   As a club, decent. As a restaurant - based on our experience, brutal."}
{"text":"I came for Summerlicious on a Tuesday night and the place was packed. There's 3 floors, first floor was a bar style with some seating, 2nd floor was more seated dining, and 3rd floor was outdoors. I originally reserved the outdoors but opted for indoors because of how humid the day was. The first thing I noticed was how loud and busy it was but I think Summerlicious contributed in addition to the after work crowd.  I started with a butternut squash ravioli topped with shrimp, the salmon, and the key lime pie. I also tasted the hunters chicken. The food is really good. The ravioli was rich and I really liked the chicken and salmon. The key lime pie was good though a bit too sweet for me.   I was also impressed by their cocktail menu and would definitely come back for more. I had the frose (a mix of vodka, rose, and strawberry) and it was delicious.    Service was attentive considering how busy they were. Overall a good experience!"}
{"text":"Great food, atmosphere, and friendly servers. All entrees exceeded my expectations. Definitely recommend trying the short-rib and Kobe meatball spaghettini. Would definitely come back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"The food we had and ambience was great. My medium rare steak was cooked to perfection (not very difficult) however my gf's well done steak (a steak sin I know) was cooked completely through without being burnt. This is actually quite hard given that most places in this price range, that specialize in steaks and ribs, not mentioning any names, believe well done steaks most come with a side order of carcinogen in the form of burnt meat. I also happened to go on my birthday which got me a free dessert, the service was very good, the food of great standard(at least what we tried) and we met the manager, head chef and a host of other staff. Seemed they genuinely want this to go well (duh). I'd probably give it a 4.5 out of 5 because I thought the yam fries could have a better sauce but my gf disagrees and I'm sure other people will enjoy it"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with the family.  The place was busy so there was a short wait for a table.  TVs were playing hockey so the time passed quickly.  Service was just right. Not too little and not too intrusive.  Food was cooked perfectly.  I had the Hunter Chicken.  The chicken was cooked but moist, the potatoes and green beans were also cooked perfectly.   Other than the cramped parking, it was good first visit to Cactus Club Cafe."}
{"text":"I woukd say the environment is tidy and waiteresses are very polite. The food however does not carry the presentation and taste of what is suppose to. I had jambolaya which had no taste and tried key lime pie that again did not have the right taste. So I guess it all depends if you look for a spot or spot and good food. It is all up to you."}
{"text":"Took a seat at the bar for dinner. Was greeted by 3 bartenders and they kindly changed the TV channel so I could watch the hockey game. Had a couple beer and the teriyaki bowl. Was very tasty,  a little spicy but the beers helped."}
{"text":"We decided to do summerlicious with my girlfriends and it was a tough choice between here and one other place but I'm glad we ended up going here because the food and the FROZÉ and sangria was the BOMB!   The service was very friendly and the rooftop was beautifully lit and all my friends were super satisfied with their meals (and desserts )   We will definitely be coming back to chill at the patio and have that Frozé again (love the name +)"}
{"text":"waited three hours for a table that never came. food and drinks are great but don't waste your time here if you don't have a reservation"}
{"text":"This a a nice restaurant in the Calgary airport area. Good steaks but I really like the ravioli with butternut squash and prawns.   The staff here is really good and they have a excellent selection of craft beers and mixed drinks"}
{"text":"My current fav restaurant in the downtown area, I'm so glad they opened one up in Toronto after trying this place out in BC!   Think Joeys, Earls, Milestones, and the likes, but 10 times better in terms of the quality of food. This place has 3 levels and I highly suggest getting seated at The Deck which is their rooftop level with a retractable roof. Reservations are always difficult so call very far in advanced. I've tried walking in on a few weekends to be told there'd be a 2 hour wait so come early or try a weekday. Service is very professional and the ambiance is very hip with a DJ sometimes spinning tunes on the deck.  Ok now let me rave about the food. Every single person that's asked me about this place have probably heard me shout SABLEFISH very loudly in their ears. So dear reader, please remember to order the Sablefish. One of the best fish dishes I've ever tasted, it was so buttery smooth my mouth was watering at every bite.  In addition to the amazing Sablefish, the Roasted Butternut Squash Ravioli with Prawns is also a well known dish here. However, my tip is to order the appetizer version of this which comes with 3 pieces so it's enough for you to enjoy it and allow you to try something else too as the dish can be quite heavy on your tummy. The Hunter Chicken is also an excellent choice as the chicken was cooked to perfection and had a lot of flavour!  In terms of apps, the tuna stack and beef carpaccio would also be the must trys! Come with a group of friends and order a bunch of different things so you can sample how delicious everything on their menu is!  Definitely going to keep coming back (and keep trying to get a table without reservation on a weekend) and am going to try their other seafood mains! Cactus Club is probably one of the best chain restaurants you could go to!"}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed my meals at Cactus Club. I recently checked out the NE location for the first time and I quite liked the atmosphere, received great service and had the best dish ever! If you haven't tried the Butternut Squash & Prawn Ravioli- order it. It's amazing!"}
{"text":"Great service! Creole chicken was amazing. It was recommended by Ariana, and it delivered! Thanks Cactus, I'll be back."}
{"text":"I really like this particular location. Staff are always so friendly and accommodating. My friend and I ordered the teriyaki chicken bowl and quinoa salad to share, and without us even asking they split up the meal in separate dishes for us! How nice of them!!!!  For the consideration alone I give them 5 stars. Both items we ordered ordered were awesome. Not too heavy, lots of fresh vegetables. The spicy yogurt in the teriyaki dish was delicious. I recommend this location for quality food and service."}
{"text":"Went here after work on a hot sunny day, we sat on the upstairs patio. It was Tuesday so the bellinis and half price wine was super great to have, we got truffle fries which were also super delicious. The space is nice however two stars off. One because we made a reservation, we arrived on time and were directed upstairs where we had to wait roughly 25 minutes for our table, what's the point of a reservation then? Mind you it was at 330 pm so this was before the rush. Second star off because the waitress was far more concerned with the table beside us, I believe they were off duty staff but she was way more attentive and friendly, with us she seemed very hasty like she just wanted to get away. The only time she showed us a little more attention was when we were paying our bills.....surprising."}
{"text":"Wandered over because I was staying in the area... and I give it 5 stars because I love a good steak that is cooked perfectly.  I love steak but don't order it often because if it comes out and it's not cooked right I die a little inside :-p, but I trusted the yelpers on this one. I ordered the millionaire's cut medium rare and it was was juicy and flavorful without a bunch of crazy overpowering sauces masking the taste of the meat and was cooked just how I wanted. The prawns were wonderful and buttery also... making me think I'd come back again to try a shrimp dish. Good asparagus but nothing too special about the mashed potatoes.  I got an Ugly Ale that was my favorite (I tend to stick to hefeweizens and avoid really hoppy beers).  A bit pricey for that steak maybe, but I was happy with it. The atmosphere was chill with a lot of the after-work crowd (sat at the bar and both waitresses remembered what I ordered and drank, even if they didn't take the order)."}
{"text":"Food is not bad but the service is generally meh. Long waits for tables even with a reso, rude service staff, if it wasn't for location this place would have sank awhile ago. More West Coast mediocrity imported into our city as 'new and fresh'. Oh and they disrespected and denied our city's starting pitcher service on the night he won a home game cuz they hire bouncers with God-complexes at this place. Yes bouncers. At a restaurant. Yeesh."}
{"text":"Love this place.   The atmosphere, the food and the location. All amazing. You can go there before a game, to watch the game or to just have an upscale dinner. Its a must visit in the city.  I am glad this place finally came to Toronto!"}
{"text":"Great service. You will be waited upon! I had the Baja fish tacos. Good stuff perfect crunch and perfect fries."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this spot! I spend every weekend here in the summer and come here atlas once a month otherwise. I have hosted a few birthdays here as well and every time is has been a great time! The atmosphere is absolutely amazing! Winters are great because you get to feel as though you are outside but are intact not freezing (the deck). Summers are definitely my favourite as it is the perfect environment to enjoy the summer breeze and heat!  The drinks are reasonably priced. Anywhere else you go, your looking to pay about the same price if not more and each drink is absolutely amazing! Plus if you go during happy hour you get great deals!The staff is always accommodating and helpful in getting you seated as quickly as possible! The food is amazing. Variety of food! my favourites are the burgers and the truffle fries!"}
{"text":"Another amazing experience here. I went for a good friends 40th birthday dinner. I forgot the servers name but she was sweet and took care of all of us very good.  She recommended some great alcohol free drinks that tasted amazing and the chicken and mashed potatoes literally are the best I've had ever.   Thanks for a great environment, and another great evening. Steve !"}
{"text":"The service was good but the food is terrible. Avoid tuna club and salmon. The salmon was old and the tuna had arugula drenched in a horrible vinegar. Tasted like a ballon!"}
{"text":"I don't know why I have not reviewed the Cactus Club, even though I have been there several times, my dining experience last night really made me remember what I like about this place and also, although minor, what I don't like.    Likes:  Very nicely decorated inside. Uber-modern, cool bar area separated by glass so you can see in and out of.  Signature Rob Feeny selections, I recommend the hunter chicken, quite possibly the best I have had.  Deserts are not too shabby either, we shared a key lime pie and it was heavenly....ahhhh what I would do to it in private.  Awesome appetizers, generous in portion and quite possibly the best calamari I have had in a long time, it was tender and I loved the tempura peppers that they had added for a bit of heat.   Friendly waitresses, although somewhat provocatively dressed, were quite helpful and competent, which is always a plus.  There was a management presence and we were checked up on by one or two of the floor managers just to ask how we were and how the food was.  I like that, to me it means that this establishment actually cares enough about the customer to just pop by and say \"hey, I hope everything is good\" is great by me, even if it is a bit overzealous at times.   Dislikes:  Reservation restrictions, cannot reserve after 6:30 and if you reserve prior to that time, half your party has to be there to hold the table.  We had a round wood table, surface didn't feel quite as clean as it should for a restaurant, a little sticky in places.  Kind of turned me off.  Could have had more sauce and lemon wedges for the yam fries and calamari, traditionally calamari has lemon served alongside and was disappointed when there was none, and the mini sauce plates did not provide enough if everyone was to take a spoonful, some were left with none, boo hoo.  Didn't complain though, it was packed that night and the waitress was so sweet.  All in all this is a great place, I will definitely  be back and although I don't get the vibe that this is a family restaurant, there were a couple of tables with kids, but quite frankly for the price points, I wouldn't bring my kids here.  Not crazy expensive for the quality of food, but with the buzzing bar smack dab in the middle of the restaurant I would say it is not a family type joint, more of a nice place out with a group of friends or a corporate function.  See you soon, my prickly friend!"}
{"text":"I really do love this place, unfortunately I found the Macleod Trail location not up to snuff with the Barlow location.  We came in for a late lunch on Tuesday and the place was packed, it is much smaller than Barlow but surprisingly we were able to get a table for two pretty quick.  Started off with two Caesar's and I ordered the 4 mushroom 7 oz sirloin steak and my husband ordered the 12oz peppercorn New York strip.  Heavy for lunch, yes, but we skipped breakfast and it was my birthday!  First I've noticed in my recent visits that the cloth napkins have disappeared and have been replaced with paper, I really think this move takes Cactus down a notch.  Not a big deal.  Secondly their Caesar's here are not prepared the same as Barlow.  They were garnished with a pickled green bean here, Barlow has this beautiful skewer of mini peppers, onions and olives and a lime wedge-which is the main reason I order the Caesar from here.  Disappointed that it came lacking that little skewer of pickled goodness.  Also it seemed over iced, by the time our meals came, it was a watered down significantly.  Our mains arrived in a reasonable amount of time but immediately my husband noticed that his steak was not 12oz, he is a beast and knows his steak.  Mine came out fine but it was lacking in salt.  He waves our waitress down and asks her if his steak in indeed the 12 oz peppercorn NY strip...she was a sweet girl and immediately  apologized and said \"I'm sorry I got you the 9oz peppercorn SIRLOIN!\"   My husband and I are not unreasonable people and really, 3 more ounces of steak wasn't going to ruin our lunch but he is not a fan of the sirloin cut; less fat=less flavour.  He told her not to worry about it and we finished our meal.  Our plates were bussed by another waitress and our bill came, I would have liked to share a desert with the man as a small celebratory birthday sweet but we were never offered a desert menu so we just paid the bill and left.  I would have given a higher star rating if the waitress was on her game as the food was good but the Caesar's were just ok and the paper napkins remind me of a cafeteria.    Might just stick with Cactus on Barlow."}
{"text":"The location is great. The staff were friendly. The drink menu has lots of options. Unfortunately the food was meh... Our appetizers and pasta dishes were so salty I could hardly taste the flavour of other ingredients...."}
{"text":"I dined at Cactus Club Cafe on a Saturday night. The place was packed at 6pm but I had made reservations beforehand to make sure my party and I didn't have to wait. My party of 4 arrived promptly on time and we still had to wait 5-10 minutes to be escorted to our table. Once seated at our booth, we had a problem with reading our menus as the lighting was just too dark in the restaurant. We had to resort to pulling out our smartphones in order to use the flashlight.   My party ordered these following drinks/dishes: - Sangria - Loved the fresh pieces of fruit in the drink. - Caesar - Tuna stack - My friend ordered this and I found it to taste quite good. - Short rib pappardelle - My main dish; overall the pasta was cooked al dente and the portion was quite big. Only problem was that the more I ate the pasta, the saltier it got.  - Butternut squash ravioli with prawns - I had a taste of this and it was delicious, but my friends also said that they found it on the salty side. - Pan roasted lingcod  Overall we enjoyed our cocktails but the food was slightly on the salty side. I can see the appeal for this restaurant as it is a great place to unwind after a long day of work to have a few drinks. However, the cooks need to control the salt in their dishes as it was too much as one point."}
{"text":"I love everything about Cactus Club, the ambience, the service.  I come here often for the butternut squash and prawn ravioli, its heaven with every bite"}
{"text":"I came here for celebratory drinks and to share some appetizers. Sangria was on special so I ordered that and it was definitely delicious, I like how they put bellini slush with it. it was very delicious and better than sangria I have enjoyed fairly recently. We ordered the chicken fingers with yam fries and calamari to share between the 3 of us. When the order was brought it was cute as they had actually split up the chicken fingers into 3 separate plates with the fries and separate sauces for each of us. Then I noticed how small each chicken finger was and we had been given regular fries.  No big deal, we ate them.  The calamari has lots of other things thrown into it, battered jalapenos, red peppers, various other unrecognizable vegetables, but the plate was mainly discarded batter and it just wasn't very good. They give you two different sauces with this dish a tzatziki and a kind of red pepper aioli. I could barely pick up the tiny pieces of what squid there was to get sauce on it.  Nice to have options I guess.  Our server didn't notice that we had not got the yam fries and we were still charged for them on our bill. Food was really, pretty mediocre, but I will slurp back more of that sangria anytime!  Review #16 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge"}
{"text":"I like Cactus Club - I really do. Biased? Don't care, it's a good place anyway. Strange combination of noisiness and coziness.  Food quality - professional. Portions - on a smallish side, but still ok. Price - biting, but not that bad. On the outside it looks way more expensive, and it's a pleasant discovery when the bill arrives.  Service was always swift, polite, helpful. I was dropping in without previous notice, yet there was always a nice table for me, or even a booth, despite the crowd inside - and with minimal wait, if any.  Parking was rather tight, that's a negative, but probably the only negative I have about Cactus Club. Otherwise, it's a totally good to go place, in my opinion."}
{"text":"Although the establishment is casual yet trendy, beware of the staff who do not understand their own menu.  I went on a date with my boyfriend last night and had high hopes as I have had great experiences with the  Cactus Clubs in Vancouver.  However, I was incredibly disappointed with the staff as they did not seem to understand their own menu.  I ordered a steak dinner with a couple of sides and after waiting 20 minutes or so to receive my meal, it was not what I had ordered at all...  I sent the meal back and was told that it would be made correctly. The second time it came out it was a completely different steak meal altogether!  Not only was my meal messed up once, it was messed up twice by the waitress and the manager!  To top it off, the waitress barely came to our table to provide us with water, etc. She didn't even seem to care that she ruined my dining experience.  Very disappointed in this venue's service as it does not reflect the service of that in the Vancouver Cactus Club's.  Good luck to those of you trying out this place for the first time.  RIP."}
{"text":"Hubby and I decided to come here for our anniversary dinner and boy did they ever exceed our expectations. First of all the vibe here is soo contagious! It just exudes a chillness that makes you want to stick around and relax and that we did.  We had made an early reservation of 5pm to just beat the crowd. The hostess lead us up a flight of stairs to our really spacious and private booth at the back of the dining room. We were right in the centre and a few steps above the rest of the tables so we had a perfect view of the entire room. At that time there were probably 4 other tables of people but by 6pm every single table was full.  Our waitress for the night came over to introduce herself and she was bubbly and sweet as ever. To start our night off she brought us over two glasses of complimentary champagne as she heard we were celebrating our anniversary. Of course we needed some more libations for the evening so we also ordered some Sangria. Signature Sangria - Zinfandel, apricot brandy, fresh strawberries, raspberries, sprite, and Bellini Wow! By far I have to say it's the Best Sangria the city has to offer! I love that they topped it off with some frozen Bellini too. It was a good sized drink as well and let's just say it was strong enough that I didn't require another!  For food we basically just wanted to keep eating all night long and the Cactus Club offers a great assortment of shareable dishes to fulfill this. Here's the round up of all the dishes we ordered that evening  Edamame - Steamed soy beans, sea salt You really can't go wrong with these, perfectly cooked, hefty portion, and a good dusting of salt  Szechuan Chicken Lettuce Wrap - Sweet and spicy spicy Szechuan glaze, peanuts, wontons, Korean chili sauce, spicy yogurt  Sooo good!! Definitely our favourite dish of the evening!! It just had everything you want in a dish from the sweet glaze, crunchy wontons, salty roasted peanuts, and a nice kick of heat all wrapped in a refreshing cool lettuce leaf. You just want to keep eating it and I'm glad it was a generous portion as we devoured it!  Mini Burgers - Certified angus beef, cheddar, alder smoked bacon, red pepper relish Another winner and how can you not be with the addition of smokey bacon!These burgers were soo juicy! The meat was very flavourful and had nice crispy edges but not dry at all and I loved the brioche buns they used.  Truffle Fries - Truffle, herbs, grant Padano, garlic aioli To be honest I was expecting these to suck but it was totally the opposite reaction. They were perfectly cooked, nice and golden and crisp, perfect amount of truffle oil, and nicely salted with a heavy dusting of cheese. Soo good!!  Chicken Wings - Salt and pepper, celery, creamy Parmesan dip Again perfectly cooked , crispy golden brown skin with a light sprinkling of flaked salt and coarse ground black pepper. My only qualm would be that they were a tad on the small side but none the less good.  Even if we weren't already stuffed from all that food I can never pass up dessert especially when it combines my two favourite flavours: chocolate+peanut butter  Chocolate Peanut Butter Crunch Bar - Tahitian vanilla ice cream, caramel sauce, crunchy chocolate pearls Boy was I in heaven! Definitely very rich and fudgey with a mellow peanut buttery taste throughout but thankfully not too sweet. Loved the addition of crunchy pearls to add some texture to all that fudgey goodness. The ice cream was also a great accompaniment to help balance all that richness however I did find the ice cream a bit too sweet. Otherwise a bomb dessert for a chocolate peanut butter lover like myself. Plus the plate was adorned with a happy anniversary dusting in cocoa powder!  I have to say overall I had such a great time here and they really went above to make our anniversary feel special! We were there for 2.5+ hrs and never once felt rushed or ignored despite being in a fully packed restaurant. I was really impressed by the service here. Food came out in a timely fashion and everything was scrumptious including the drinks! Our waitress was really attentive and never let our water glasses go empty and consistently checked up on us. The ambiance here is simply perfect and bonus with the DJ spinning great music all night long. This is definitely a place worth checking out and I will for sure be making a return visit!"}
{"text":"I went here for my very first time for my friends birthday, the entire restaurant was beautiful and massive, although I rated it a 3 because the one hostess at the top floor gave me attitude when i kindly wanted to ask her a question about the seating and our food took way too long to get to our table. Other than that it was a good experience. Please be careful who you hire there, I am sure you can find someone much more appealing ;)"}
{"text":"I was satisfied with the food and drinks but not the service. I wish servers were more attentive."}
{"text":"To be honest, my expectations for this place weren't too high. I assumed it would be a typical Financial District place with a Milestones-type menu, but my expectations were exceeded. Reading the menu, particulalry the mains, it felt more sophisticated than I had anticipated. I was in a burger/sandwich mood, though, so I ordered the BBQ Duck Clubhouse. With a unique combination of ingredients including peking duck, roasted chicken, prosciutto di modena and pecan fruit bread, it was absolutely delicious. Loved the flavours. My cocktail, the Fawlty Tower, was also delicious and refreshing. I will gladly come back here."}
