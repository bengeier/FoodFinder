{"text":"My husband & I go to crepe spots all the time and the quality of these crepes are phenomenal. It's rich and thick. The strawberries taste great. The Carolina love is a must have!"}
{"text":"They have some of the best ice-cream that I have ever taste that was just creamy and fresh."}
{"text":"C3 is the place to be for great crepes made with fresh fruits topped with chocolate, peanut butter sauce which is my favorite and more.... They are Delicious! /Delicioso! Great coffee and liquid frozen ice cream, frozen right before your eyes. Great atmosphere as well! You have to try it!"}
{"text":"This place needs to work on themselves. It  seemed as though the staff were not trained on all the aspects of the shop, most just bumbling around behind the counter. The \"ice cream\" is more like sugar soup. The nitrogen was cool to watch, however, we were handed ice cream that was much more melted than solid. And all this after roughly waiting 20min for said ice cream. And $8 for a small serving of ice cream soup is a little tough to stomach. We were excited to try a new place in town and were nothing but disappointed. We will be sticking to sweet frog down the road from here on out."}
{"text":"I had the strawberry and banana crepe it was amazing.  Awesome place to be.  Amazing people.  I would recommend"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite coffee shop in NC. Plus the have  live  music  on the second Tuesday of the month, its a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"The Carolina Love crepe is amazing; I also had the mint chip nitrogen ice cream and it was smooth as silk. I will definitely be going back the next time I am in NC!"}
{"text":"Very nice and quiet coffee spot in the am, and fun in the evening to meet friends! The crepes are to die for and the waffles are thick and crispy just the way I like them! They have great coffee and lots of fancy choices too! I have tried the nitrogen ice cream once and it was pretty good, good spot to stop at on a hot summers evening during date night!!"}
{"text":"I've only visited once, but will probably not be back. The location is very small, with few places to sit and talk. It was fairly busy when I went, and they were taking orders at the register and an iPad someone was walking around with. That was a horrible move, and it's a terrible business practice. It caused several people's orders to come out after someone that came in later; that's lousy customer service. They only have two crepe pans, so they do not make them very fast. It would be worth it if the prices were not so high, but the crepe was just okay."}
{"text":"This place is very unique! My children loved the nitrogen experience. My husband and I had the crepes! Deliciousss! We will definitely come back for late night desert next time."}
{"text":"Great crepes, however they need to work on their coffee. Seems like they might be spread a bit to thin. Creamer in single serving cups and coffee that hardly seems worthy of a coffee shop designation."}
{"text":"Great experience. Will be going back for more yummy coffee! Service was stellar. I think they have a great spot here"}
{"text":"An amazing find in Concord. My husband and I treated ourselves to a crepe and ice cream. Both were amazing. Definitely consider this place for a special treat."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I found it while looking on Yelp for places quick to eat on my trip from the airport. I love crepes and had to go here especially with the other photos and reviews.   My flight was delayed so I was nervous I would not make it in time before they closed at at 8:00 pm. I pulled in the pale king lot at 7:51 pm. I went inside and asked if I could still get a crepe even though it was close to their closing time. The two ladies were very nice and assured me it was fine. I enjoyed their Carolina Love crepe and ate it in instead of eating in my rental car. They have a self serve water station. A great find with delicious crepes and the coffee smelled so good."}
{"text":"It's dangerous since I live so close to here! Right when you walk in, the manager (I believe) greets you. She told us about the menu and gave us her recommendations, which I really appreciated! I ended up getting what she recommended, which was the Carolina Love Crepe. My little cousins also got the Strawberry Bloom and Oreo Delight Ice cream. The ice cream is made with nitrogen, giving it this nice richness and creaminess. It's so rich, it's very fulfilling. They STUFF that crepe. It wasn't too overwhelmingly sweet so you don't feel like you're gonna die from a sugar rush after eating it. They used biscotti bits and I APPLAUD that idea because a crepe needs textural differences and it really made the crepe taste better with the crunchiness and smokiness of the biscotti. Cinnamon was also sprinkled over the Carolina Love, it was just a fabulously well-thought out crepe.   The interior is rustic and very cute! It felt very home-y. Prices do get a little high, however portions are HUGE. Unless you can always eat sweets, I would recommend sharing with someone nonetheless.  I'm glad this sweet joint opened up in Concord, it's what we need to slowly build this town's food scene!"}
{"text":"Smores crepe is amazing.  Marshmallow and chocolate everywhere... very well done and tasty.  They open at 7 but crepes don't get made until after 9 a.m.   Nitrogen ice cream apparently is quite amazing and fresh...haven't had other but friends rave.   Latte... expensive and small. Still delicious but unsure about the price point for what you get.  Staff during middle of the day was amazing, welcoming and very personable! Hope this local business can make it!"}
{"text":"I'm in Concord for work and I was looking for a small business offering good quality coffee. I found C3 by searching Google Maps and I was excited to visit because I was in dire need for something other than big chain coffee. Well, I arrived and started to read the board to see what the offerings are. I was greeted by the bartista and then had an awkward moment with her. Told her I was trying to decide between having a coffee or an espresso drink. She then told me something along the lines that they are the same. I'm a coffee snob and started to doubted my excitement for this local coffee spot. I felt awkward and just wanted to get out of there. I quickly ordered a coffee which ended up being Drip coffee. The bartista gave me a cup and pointed me to the coffee. I like a little cream  or half&half at times and they only offer packaged cream - the kind that is processed to be left out at room temperature. I passed on the cream. The coffee ended tasting pretty good. I was really hopeful that I found a good to coffee spot, but packaged creamer seems out of place for this spot; therefore, it's a no go for me. If you are not picky about coffee, you might want to check out this spot. Not only for coffee, but their crepes and ice cream which look promising. Processed cream - can't get over that."}
{"text":"Rip off! They charge $5.25 for what would be less than a \"tall\" at Starbucks! Not to mention it was gross....the crepes and ice cream might be good but totally overpriced! Ice cream specials are around $8.25! No thanks!"}
{"text":"Quality of the crepes and coffee was very good. I ordered the Bananas Foster, which contained nutella, caramel, nuts, bananas, and whipped cream. I also ordered a regular cappuccino. Soft opening meant some hiccups with timing of the order, but I think the team assembled can get this worked out soon. Couple of suggestions; make sure coffee and food orders come out at the same time, group same ticket orders together as well. We got our coffee and had finished it before I got my crepe order, then my husband got his crepe when I was almost finished with mine. Last suggestion, make your own whipped cream. The concept and cool atmosphere I think dictate fresh, real whipped cream. Again, the items were delicious, the atmosphere is very cool! I think the hiccups just need to be worked out with time. Looking forward to visiting again when they get into their groove, and I fully believe they WILL!"}
{"text":"Ice cream is amazing! Coffee is ok.  I went to get  coffee and study..this was not the place to study. The girl behind the counter was friendly but  sang off key the whole time I was there ."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my C3 experience this morning. You walk into a traditional coffee shops with cafe tables, a long community table with a cute sitting area in the back. The staff was supper friendly and help me make a decision since it waa my first time there.   I decided on the macchiato with steamed almond milk and a strawberry and banana crepe. Everything was so fresh and delicious and filling. They even have a rewards card for locals if I lived here I would've taken the card.   The crepe was made to order with fresh fruit that was naturally sweet and loaded into the crepe. The macchiato was perfect with a great pick me up to start my day with. I am glad I stepped out and just went for it instead of trying someplace close to my hotel."}
{"text":"This review is specific to their latte making skills, which were very good!  Plus, we got them in real mugs, which is alway nice!  Crepe menu sounds nice, plus the also have wine.  Nice atmosphere inside, very friendly. I'll come back!"}
{"text":"This place was sooo good!! I was stuck between what to order but as I asked the cashier she recommended the Carolina Love because it was their most popular.. as soon as I tried it I see why it was the top seller.. I accompanied it with the White Chocolate mocha latte, I was in heaven!  Every time I come up from Miami I will definitely be going here!!"}
{"text":"Mouth watering crepe!  Just wish I had enough room to eat some fresh ice cream too.  They make it from scratch right in front of you.  Looked amazing! Very friendly staff also."}
{"text":"Five stars without a doubt! When you walk in the atmosphere is mellow coffee shop with a twist of southern. Brian/ Bryan welcomed my wife and I with a huge smile, and even took the time to walk around the counter and engage in meaningful conversation (We were the only ones in at the time). We first got a white chocolate mocha to-go which was everything a white-chocolate mocha should be. Full of flavor, sweet, but not loaded with too much sugar.  We came back a half an hour later to be blown away by the \"Carolina Love\" (we added the chocolate syrup and they added some maple syrup for us to try for free). The crepe itself was light and a perfect blanket for the cookie butter and strawberries to lay in. Strawberries ripened to perfection rested in a layer of whipped Crete drizzled with the chocolate syrup was an elegant presentation.    UPDATE 01July2017- Very expensive for what you get in return. My wife and I split a crepe and coffee that is over 15 Dollars."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The employees make the ice cream right in front of you, with liquid nitrogen and whatever toppings you want. Nice atmosphere too."}
{"text":"Carolina love on the waffle!!! Was amazing!!!  This is a great place Very homie and the staff was great!!!"}
{"text":"YES YES YES. Ohmygod I think I'm in love! Crepes, Coffee AND Icecream .. can't get better than that. They just moved near Publix, which is too perfect! (Since I'm literally there 24/7 & I live like 5 mins away oh god I'm going to get so fat lol!!) I came during their \"grand opening\" week, so I wasn't expecting too much since they had just opened. But I was totally blown away the staff was so so sweet! They were all so welcoming and greeted you as soon as you walked in the door(: The girl walked me outside to their menu, and suggested I shouldorder their signature \"Carolina Love\" which was really good. At first I thought it was a little pricy, I mean $10 for a crepe?? But honestly it's pretty big so you could totally share it. I also really liked how they make their nitrogen icecream right in front of you, pretty cool man! Oh and their decor- LOVE. I didn't get a chance to try their coffee, but will do next time I drop by with a couple of friends(;"}
{"text":"Bananas Foster waffles with Carmel lattes, all made fresh to order just for us! We were treated like royalty from the moment we walked in the door, and the waffles were pure indulgence, washed down by the silkiest smooth latte I have ever had. Will be coming back. Regularly."}
{"text":"Fiancé and I wanted to try something new and were in the mood for coffee and crepes. Decided to try C3. The atmosphere is nice. The crepes were actually really good, except my crepe was ready within 5 minutes of ordering and my fiancés took another 15-20 minutes to make, and there were no orders ahead of us. So that was a little disappointing. Overall it wasn't a bad experience. We live in Charlotte so we probably won't make the drive all the way out there again for that, and the fact that we spent $38 on 2 crepes and 2 lattes."}
{"text":"Their crepes were really good! The area is a fairly new shopping complex. Maybe 10-15 minutes away from concord mills. If you are in the concord area you should check them out!"}
{"text":"I am always looking for new coffee shops to try. I love coffee and like to change the shops I study/do work in. I went to C3 and ordered a crepe and sat down to do work. The crepe was burnt, I'm guessing the worker was new and had never made crepes before, but I was watching it burn right in front of me. Also it was pretty pricey compared to other crepes around charlotte. Then, I sat down to do work and they have no wifi! It's a new place so maybe it will get better with time but, my experience was terrible!"}
{"text":"I've been hoping to see a place like this locally for a very long time. The atmosphere alone is a selling point for me. It's a place anyone can enjoy. The staff are all nice and very helpful. Their coffee is delicious and their menu offerings are well thought out and unique."}
{"text":"This is a weird place... if the manager is in, and you ask for a latte with soymilk, she'll tell you that's not in the original recipe and cant guarantee the taste.  Basically, she won't make it. When she's not in, no issues.   Weird...  Coffee is good though!"}
{"text":"In love!  Bananas Foster Crepe is soooooo yummy! Will be back again, for sure! Atmosphere is relaxed and calm."}
{"text":"The crepes are out of this world! Amazing! What a great addition to Concord!! The service was great and fast. The lattes were also great with multiple flavors to choose from. If you are looking for a great dessert and coffee place for after dinner, this is the place!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed all 3 of the C's (nitrogen ice Cream, Coffee, Crepe). Everything was very flavorful and savory and I felt like I was being given a special treat. I boarded several weeks ago and can still remember the taste. Everytime I visit Concord I will visit C3."}
{"text":"Cute little coffee/dessert spot. Got the white mocha latte and it was delicious, will be back to try the nitrogen ice cream!"}
{"text":"Hands down THE BEST coffee, crepes, creamery and dessert wine in town! Had the chance to stop in for a quick cup of cafe! The service is world class (staff actually like their jobs), the coffee is strong and packs a caffeine punch that's second to none, all done with a smile...just the way I like it! A must try: the Carolina Love crepe (made with biscoff cookie spread -to die for!) Such a pleasure, stop in when in the area of Concord, NC, you'll be pleasantly surprised and really glad you did!"}
{"text":"I have had many crepes in my life and by far this is my ultimate favorite. We came to visit from California and we found this place here on yelp. We are so pleased with the service. They even give you a quote of the day. Such an inspirational way experience this place. The owner was there and we had such a nice chat. Ok just go visit NOW!!!"}
{"text":"We tried this place when we had family visiting from Florida. Sorry to say, I was less than impressed. The ice creams were nothing great, in fact they were super rich. None of us finished our ice creams. The lemon ice cream was tart tart tart. I have had a lot of lemon ice creams and know that they should be a little tart but it should still be sweet. My dad couldn't finish his. I tried some and I hated it too. And the ice creams here cost twice as much as any other ice cream. We came by after dinner and our check at C3 was more than our dinner check! The last straw was when I was watching them make ice cream and on the other side they were serving crepes and the girl actually scooped ice cream from a Publix tub of vanilla ice cream. When I asked the guy about it he said it would be too expensive to serve nitrogen frozen ice cream over crepes. Um, you are an ICE CREAM SHOP. How can you serve ice cream that you literally bought next door? And the staff really needs to get their act together. They were out of two flavors of ice cream on a Saturday evening! And the toppings mentioned mixed berries but when we ordered those the cashier gave us a confused look and said \"we don't have mixed berries.\" When I showed her the menu she said it must be a mistake. Geez, what a flop show! Sorry but I will not be returning to this place."}
{"text":"Family date night ended with some ice cream , a chai and a crepe! Pls is very cool and super original. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First off, always support local. Second-wow! Great service, super kind and helpful! Clean and hip interior. Crepes looked great (but we skipped that for ice cream). If you haven't had the hip nitrogen fresh ice cream-get over here! And wine goes perfectly with it!  Coffee, crepes, ice cream all made in front of you!"}
{"text":"I hate saying this... but you're better off going to Starbucks. I usually always try to go local for coffee whenever I can and being a concord native I was excited to see us getting another coffee shop other than Dilworth and Starbucks. So, here's where my experience went down south. Ordered an iced latte, it comes in one size; 16 oz. and it's $5.15; that's a little expensive for coffee and milk... They charge $.60 for flavoring (okay fine) and then if you want an extra shot of espresso it's $1.75. Usually it's around $1.00 for an extra shot. SO, I look at my receipt... my coffee is EIGHT DOLLARS, plus the only options are milk or almond. I literally could have gone to Starbucks, ordered a 24oz iced hazelnut latte with an extra shot and soy milk for around $6.21. That's ridiculous for a medium sized coffee! When I was in high school I'd go to Starbucks religiously before school because it was so early and C3 is so close to Robinson. It's not the baristas fault but needless to say, I'll be spending my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"It was good, but way more expensive than I expected. A little overpriced, in my opinion. I'd rather have a smaller portion for less money. Also, no decaf coffee. Some people can't drink caffeine and most people don't like to have caffeine at night. But it was yummy! I'd be more like to go regularly if the price was more realistic. $8-11.50 for a crepe and $8.50 for ice cream is steep!"}
{"text":"First time here and super cute! Staff was awesome and very friendly. Crepes are huge and delicious, the perfect way to treat yourself after a long week. Had the peppermint mocha and the Carolina Love crepe which was amazing! It is a little pricey, but again it's a treat yourself kind of place! Cozy and welcoming atmosphere and they have a discount punch card which will definitly make me come back!"}
{"text":"Ok. I've been here a few times now.  The good:  Everyone is friendly  Place is clean  The bad: Coffee prices are nutty. Paid $5.50 for a small mocha (not including tip)!!!!  It was ok, but about half way through, I was pulling mostly chocolate.   The ice cream was decent, but it took forever! And again, super premium pricing here. Yikes! I get the process and the novelty. But honestly, I can't wait all day when I have kids as they make the ice cream.   Maybe a good place for a date? Certainly not built for a family of 5.   The interior was nice, but nothing super different than most shops.   The seating is super limited too. Just a few 2-tops and no seating outside.   Also a bit off the beaten path.   Anyway, 3 strikes and you are out."}
{"text":"Alright...so I really wanted to love this place and also support a small business. While the food and drinks were very good the customer service left a lot to be desired.   When we first walked in we were not greeted in any way. We stood at the register for a few minutes before we were acknowledged. That absolutely drives me crazy.    My husband and I ordered a waffle and a crepe. However I wanted to leave the strawberry syrup off my waffle. I was told that she couldn't just leave it off but would have to charge me for a build your own. I pointed out that it would cost me more that way.  Then she offered to make me another variation and just add thebmissing item at no additional cost. At this point I was completely confused. So you can't leave off an item but you can add an item for free?!? It just didn't make a whole lot of sense to me.   Our drinks came out first. And then it took a bit of time before our food came out. It seems like they could benefit from having more than one person working at a time.   Thankfully both the drinks and food were delicious. Based on that I plan to give them another try. But they need to step it up from a customer service perspective."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to C3 this morning for crepes and coffee after a recommendation of a coworker.  We arrived at 8:30 when they opened.  I was disappointed to learn that they don't start serving crepes (and ice cream) until 11.  I thought it to be odd as they are two of their three menu items and crepes are a breakfast food.  We decided to stay anyway and just have coffee.  My latte and his Americano were perfect.  Top notch!  They were served in ceramic mugs with biscoff.  The service was prompt and friendly.  The barista greeted us as soon as we walked in.  The decor of the place is very sleek and modern.  I do like it, but there aren't many tables so I would imagine eating a crepe on your lap when they get busy would be challenging.  We will definitely come back after 11 to try the crepes and ice cream.  They are a little pricey as other have noted, but as with everything, you get what you pay for.  They serve quality products."}
{"text":"The crepes are super good! The coffee is never the same, I keep ordering the same coffee and I'm not only charged something different each time but it's never consistent. The owner or manager is super nice and most of the staff is pleasant. It does take a while to get your order even when there are only two people in-house and while I understand it is fresh made to order it can be a bit excessive at times."}
{"text":"Came w/ a group of 8 people. Loved the creative seating arrangements. Service was great & made for a very welcoming experience. My son loved the ice cream, my wife & I loved the crepe, & the coffee was awesome. We'll definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"We went there twice and both times not impressed.  First, as others have mentioned, it is very pricey.  The coffee, ice cream, crepes, everything was priced high for the area and even pricier then a cafe in Charlotte!  We did not try the ice cream, but watched them make it for others.  Yes, I get it, it is a cool idea and neat to watch, but not worth the price.  We tried several of the crepes and even went back a second time to give them another chance.  We were not impressed both times. These are not traditional crepes.  They are hard and crunchy on the outside, not soft and delicate like a good crepe should be.  And then they cover them with tons of stuff.  I guess some people like that but we found it to be way too sweet and just a big gloppy mess.  And you would think for the price they would give you fresh whipped cream, not from a can! Atmosphere is rather blah, with not a lot of seating.  I don't see how this place is going to make it in Concord.  It is too pricey for a family with kids to come get ice cream.  And it is not cozy and inviting to hang out for a date night.  We tried twice, but we will not be back for a third time.  You can find much better crepes, coffee and ice cream elsewhere and for less $$$"}
{"text":"30 minutes to close and there are still several people inside. Prices are a little high. Crepe was ok, good flavor just a little lacking on fillings. Ice cream had good texture. I got a make your own with coffee base, graham crackers and white chocolate chips. Ice cream didn't taste like coffee and for $.60 there wasn't enough graham cracker. Spouse got the strawberry special; ice cream had artificial strawberry flavor and the white chocolate chips left a film on the roof of both of our mouths that was very unpleasant.  Willing to try again but it was definitely a let down. Only a once in awhile destination since it's so expensive."}
{"text":"This place is a great! Great atmosphere, great people, great coffee, and unique offerings! The service is cheerful and the cafe is very homey. The coffee is much better quality than Starbucks or any chain! The coffee beans are exceptional quality apparently. They show great care in preparing your selections and are deeply concerned about your experience. The nitrogen ice cream tastes amazing and really cool to watch them make! The crepes and waffles are the best I have had and the various options are great! Definitely the best coffee shop where to hang out in the local Concord area hands down! You can chill, do work, and hang out with friends or bring a date very comfortably."}
{"text":"So, this is the second time that I've come here and received less than a warm reception. My husband and I have visited here a total of 3 times. The first time was amazing. During the second visit, we arrived at 7:35, not realizing that they close at 8, and even though we didn't realize that, the coldness that we received from one of the employees told us. So ok, i didn't appreciate the dismissive attitude but, my bad...we shouldn't have come in so late. So TODAY, we got there at 6:40, the young lady walked past us to throw something in the trash, didn't recognize our existence at the counter, but THEN she walked back by us, STILL didn't say anything until she stood in front of the register to take our order and then she said a quick \"HI\"....and i replied with a quick \"nevermind\" and came to my car to type this review. Your items are NOT inexpensive and It all boils down to customer service and common courtesy. People are not obligated to patronize your business and they are less willing to do so when they are not acknowledged with the respect that they ALL deserve. I will not be returning but i do wish the best for all."}
{"text":"I am addicted. Twice in two days. I Love,love their Crepes I will be bringing my entire family to share the goodness."}
{"text":"Crepes were delicious, and my latte was extremely yummy! That being said, my latte was *so* tiny for the amount that I paid for it. I am looking forward to a more varied and unique crepe menu in the future!"}
{"text":"This crepe was the best crepe I have ever had ever! So thoroughly impressed with this place! It has a cute, eclectic feel to it and the employees are super upbeat, happy, and a great representation of the company. We will be back soon! They've only been opened for 3 weeks and plan to have their grand opening at the end of April. So excited for a place like this in concord!"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying this cute little spot, I had gotten the s'mores crepe and it was so delicious one of the best crepes I've ever had. Also the service was excellent they were so welcoming and super nice also very attentive! Definitely will be back!"}
