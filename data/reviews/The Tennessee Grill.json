{"text":"You get one star when 5 people are done eating before the 6 th person gets their blt sandwich.  Was told some story about the bacon taking a long time to cook. I could have gone back and made the sandwich myself in the 3 times the waitress came over and apologized.  The only thing offered was a free desert and some money off the bill. We had 3 separate bills. Taking 20% off of a 16 dollar bill is unacceptable. Meal should have been free.  I have a choice when I go out to eat and that is the last time I will be in your restaurant. I only write reviews when I am disappointed in a restaurant which is pretty rare. Probably why I've only written 6 reviews."}
{"text":"What a rip off!  I ordered a 1/3 pound burger $5.95, cheese $1, bacon $1, Onion .75, fries $1.99 and drink 1.49.  I'm surprised they didn't charge for the air I breathed while waiting for my order.  The worst part was that the burger was flavorless.  They forgot to season it.  Fries were terrible.  Would have been much better off spending $6 at In n Out and getting the same amount of food with much better taste and quality!  Total bill for my meal and two kid meals came out to $26 dollars.  Will never go back!"}
{"text":"Love the brisket platter with coleslaw & tennessee twister fries. Good BBQ, beer & atmosphere, especially in the bar."}
{"text":"The food here was great. Loved the brisket and pulled chicken. Little to no sauce was needed. Meat was not dry either. Prices are not to bad either. Went with a party of 6 and was very accommodating. They also have beer and full bar. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Nothing special. Brisket big thick slab with not much flavor. Tried again with the fish fry,  no taste.  Ignored when I first came In. Didnt realize seating is open.  Service was good."}
{"text":"Three stars for the taste of the food but it just wasn't worth the money!! They nickel and dime you for every topping you want on your burger $10.99 plus.. $1 more for the good bun $1 more for cheese $1 more for grilled onions $1 more for mushrooms etc..left there spending $75 on three adults and one kidfor lunch!!"}
{"text":"2nd time in a row of bad service.  Waited 45 mins for an egg white omelette while all the other meals were served. Finally received the omelette after we were done with our meals. Had to get a togo box for the omelette as we had plans in Sedona. Brought the bill with no discount or apology. Had to go up to the counter and request a discount. After a discussion the omelette was taken off the bill."}
{"text":"Had dinner and it was amazing. The BLT was very good. The bloody Mary's were yummy.  Breakfast was very good. The chai tea was very good and the biscuit and gravy was great.    Cheese curds were amazing, as good as ours in Wisconsin."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!!! Stopped here on the way home from Sedona for a bite. Everything was so good, the service was amazing and even got a complimentary corn bread that was delicious!!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch today and had quite possibly the worst French dip sandwich I have ever had in my life. I ordered it with cheddar, and the first time they brought it out, it was bone cold. The cheese hadn't melted even a little bit and the meat was refrigerator cold to the touch. I sent it back, and it did come out hot, but the beef was like shoe leather and almost flavorless. There was almost more cheese than meat. I will say the server was very friendly, and she tried to make the situation right by taking the sandwich back to the kitchen and apologizing. I wouldn't even have written a negative review if that were the only issue - mistakes happen. But the food was just simply bad. I actually left this restaurant with half the sandwich still on my plate and went somewhere else to satisfy my appetite for lunch. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I highly recommend checking this place out !! The food is delicious - good sized portions, great prices. The staff is extremely friendly and knowledgable of their menu. You can enjoy a nice dinner or just sit at the bar and have a cold drink and an appetizer. Great atmosphere and fabulous BBQ !!"}
{"text":"Not so sure what all the hype is about in the reviews here. My take on Tennessee Grill is sub par. Wife had the Ruben which was average at best. She had the onion rings an again average at best. As for myself I read the reviews on the pulled pork on a pretzel bun an that seemed liked like a sure thing. Unfortunately I was extremely disappointed. The bun an pork was ok but the sweet BBQ sauce was quite possibly the worst I've tasted. It did come with A spicy BBQ that was better flavor wise however it was way too spicy to enjoy. I ended up eating the sandwich with store bought BBQ sauce from the fridge. BTW the pulled pork across the highway at Q2U BBQ is in a whole different league. If you haven't tried it you need to!! I had it with sweet potato fries that were over cooked. We also got a side of potato salad. I read someone's review that the potatoes were not cooked all the way but didn't think that would happen again an to my surprise they were 1/2 cooked an 1/2 uncooked. Not sure how this happens in one batch when all were cut about the same size. Flavor was good but 1/2 cooked potatoes isn't very appealing. The thing the really drops this establishment down for me is the very small portion sizes, for the prices they're charging I expected better food quality an larger portions. I personally think the over achieving reviews stem from the very poor food  the restaurants in Anthem out out so this actually may seem good in comparison but for myself I for sure will not be returning for lunch or dinner. I'd like to try breakfast but in afraid id only be more disappointed."}
{"text":"Food is really good, plus it's a nice change for Anthem.   Don't forget to try them for breakfast.  Not expensive per se....."}
{"text":"Friday was my first time visiting, thanks to a flat tire! While my car was being repaired I walked over for breakfast. The first impression was the restaurant was freezing. I had goose bumps almost the whole time. Anyone that knows me knows I'm not a huge breakfast fan, so I ordered lunch for breakfast. I ordered a burger with fries. The burger was good, but the fries stopped me in my tracks, and not in a good way. There was some kind of burnt fiber wrapped around a fry. Not sure if it was hair or a string of some kind, but it was black and crispy. Gag. Their ranch dressing tasted like tartar sauce, kind of pickle-y. Not my favorite. Not sure I will give it another chance."}
{"text":"Just an update that I still eat at The Tennessee Grill at least once or twice a week, and the service is great and food delicious! :) Do yourself a favor and try their sandwiches and sweet potato fries!

My husband loves that he can watch sports on their big screens while we're enjoying Sunday brunch after church. I'm excited to see the expansion of their restaurant coming up in the next couple of months."}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoyed our first visit to The Tennessee Grill and were more than pleasantly surprised.  Fantastic barbecue for sure!  We've eaten at many \"bbq\" venues across the U.S., including Memphis and discovered The Tennessee Grill to be at the top of our list.  Coming back for breakfast this week.  Don't skip this spot when you're in the Anthem, AZ area."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick dinner last week and though the wait staff was awesome,  the food was just ok. The brisket was a little dry. Could have been a fluke. Will try again due to the great staff."}
{"text":"We had the pulled pork sandwich and a burger. Very good. Great service. We were there on 4th of July, and only the bar part was open, but the server was super professional and nice."}
{"text":"Food is always the best, especially the pulled pork sandwiches and barbecue. Staff is friendly and attentive. Check out the desserts and freshly baked bread! A find in Anthem!"}
{"text":"My wife gives it 10, she had the grilled chicken wrap My BBQ chicken on a pretzel roll was nice We'll definitely come back"}
{"text":"I liked the small town feel. Reminds me of my sister's restaurant in CO. Nice servers. And peoole were having conversations instead of staring at phones or TVs. I wanted to love the food but it was just 'ok'. Not horrible but bland and just below average. We had the fish special and chicken alfredo. The slaw was tasteless and the hushpuppies were dry but oddly doughy with no taste. The fish and frIes were ok.  The alfredo sauce was kind of watery and tasted like it was from a Knorr packet. Will go again and maybe try something else."}
{"text":"Great food , Great Service love the hospitality. Try it you won't regret awesome food."}
{"text":"I love eating here every time I come threw I see the same cook i asked him his name , Daniel -and if they really smoke everything in house he was super nice and even showed us the smoker , very impressed I love this restaurant will be back"}
{"text":"My family and I came in for dinner. We were in the dinner rush, but the timing was good. They've only been open for dinner for less than 2 weeks, but it seems like they have a good rhythm down. The food was very good. We were impressed and will be back. In fact, I was jealous of my daughter's pancakes. They were absolutely delicious.  The owners are super friendly too. My husband and I both highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"If you are not 100% happy with the Brisket and eggs with a Bloody Mary .....its you not the food. This is a world class breakfast and a great Bloody Mary for under $20.  Ate right at the bar and had excellent service too!  Try this place out!"}
{"text":"Ate breakfast at Tennessee grill this morning, atmosphere was decent, service was good, food was barely ok. I ordered a ham and cheese omelet which came out with several burnt spots on it and very little flavor.  My brother  ordered corned beef hash with flour tortillas only to be told they have no flour tortillas.  After looking over the menu he asked our waitress if they served burritos. She said, \"Yes.\" Then he asked her if they made those with flour tortillas and she said yes. He then asked her if he could have tortillas with his corn beef hash. 
       His corned beef hash looked like something that rolled out of a dog food can and still no tortillas, when she asked if there was anything else we needed,  we said,  \"Yes, our flour tortillas.\" She said, \"Oh, I thought you were kidding.\" With tip it was an $82.00 breakfast for 5 of us. None of us felt it was worth the money.  We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Food...pretty good just a tad pricey for what you get.

Ambiance...kind of strange how they have there soda station out for everyone to see. One customer was constantly refilling his own drink.

Staff....friendly but only one waitress for the lunch rush = a little slow.

Verdict....it's worth a try if you love BBQ."}
{"text":"Was in the area looking for a spot to eat breakfast I wished we had went to Dennys instead. Overall the food taste not so good I had eggs, bread, and hashbrowns. We also had the biscuit and gravy tasted to salty. Our server was ok she took our order that was it. The other servers looked like they didn't want to be working a morning shift."}
{"text":"Truly tasty BBQ and lots of less traditional options too, like a pulled pork quesadilla.  I'm a fan of the bourbon sauce especially.  This is a \"must eat\" if you're in the area for the mall across the street or the range near by."}
{"text":"I was in here the other night and I was very impressed. I was greeted immediately upon entering this restaurant and I really enjoyed the restaurants unique style. I ordered the BBQ sampler plate and I was blown away at the delicious smokey and tender flavor of each item on the plate: ribs, brisket, sausage, pulled pork and pulled chicken sliders. I was especially delighted with the homemade zinger BBQ sauce and recommend it to anyone who likes a little zest to their food. Along with this appetizing plate of smoked meat I got my choice of two sides. I picked the baked beans and the twister fries. The baked beans tasted homemade, sweet and tangy. The twister fries were a delightful twist on regular fries which I also liked to dip in that zinger BBQ sauce. Overall my experience here was exemplary and I would recommend it to anyone in anthem or even far away!"}
{"text":"The BBQ was very good. I had the smoked wings and they were wonderful. Another party at our table had the Brisket, and my wife had the BLT piled high with smoked bacon. Unfortunately, everything else was just okay if that. My impression is that they make the BBQ themselves, but a lot of the food was not made in house. The chicken strips and appetizers were standard bar food, the kind restaurants buy prepared and then heat up. If you go here, I would strongly advise you stick with the BBQ.

The place was packed and everyone seemed to be having a great time. The service was excellent, our waitress was very warm and friendly, no compliants. The atmosphere is festive, it's a fun place, feels like a neighborhood joint.

The fare seemed a bit overpriced to me. The cocktails and beer especially seemed priced high. My Jack and Coke and my 22oz draft beer were $7.45 each, but I'm from Phoenix, maybe those are the going rates in Anthem. I can easily remember better food in nicer places for less money.

I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, but I wouldn't object if I were with people who wanted to go. 

The place was packed, so what do I know? Try it yourself and stick to the BBQ."}
{"text":"Update!

Last time I was here, there was no bar and there are some more items on the menu.
I ordered the slider : brisket and pulled pork. DELICIOUS! !! Juicy and just melts! You have to try the raspberry BBQ sauce that they offer. They are to die for, so underrated! I came back a couple of times after. Next time, I'll order other things too. The servers that they hire has always been nice and attentive so that's a plus. 

Idk what the other reviewer is thinking when he says this place needs Gordon Ramsey LMFAO. I wouldn't go into that deep end. Maybe if this place had roaches and terrible rude servers. Trust me, I've been to a place where they literally just shoved a plate at you and walked away. 

In any way, I believe they've improved for the better. The bar area is still small, but this place is the top 2 or 3 places in Anthem for sure. Legends is overrated."}
{"text":"Very good BBQ and service. Will definitely be back if I'm ever in the area again! Give it a try people, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"It's fine. Nothing special. Good for breakfast or brunch. Sad that they always have Fox News on the TV's. That makes my stomach turn."}
{"text":"Came in here Sunday and had the BBQ slider plate.  Very good.  I think I'll be hanging in here more often come football season.  This is far better than the other sports bars in Anthem."}
{"text":"We had lunch today, and it was great! Busy place, but the staff was working hard to take care of everyone.  The BBQ brisket on a pretzel bun was Super! We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Fresh baked bread in the morning is fantastic on the nose and the service is great. You can't beat a place that has brisket in their breakfast menu!"}
{"text":"This was our first time to The Tennessee Grill and it didn't disappoint. I ordered the Reuben and sweet potato fries. The Reuben was very tasty and a nice size. My husband got the tuna melt in which he also really enjoyed. We will be back!"}
{"text":"We have been to Tennessee Grill many times. The only time we didn't have a decent meal was when we got a burger other than that everything has been great!"}
{"text":"We have been here several times for breakfast and for lunch, during busy times and not. The service has always been spot on, the food cooked perfectly, and my wife and children enjoy it each time.

They also sell bread. Most store bought bread is mediocre and best. Here, they have delicious loaves of bread for sale. That and the cinnamon buns are brilliant.

The smoked meats are a nice touch as well. I have tried the pulled pork on a pretzel bun and it is delish."}
{"text":"Wow the ribs, best I've ever had juicy and delicious, wings also best I've ever had. Service was excellent, always made sure we had everything we needed, make sure you stop by, this place is AWESOME!!"}
{"text":"I've been to \"the grill\" a few dozen times and tried the wings for the first time this evening. Most bars serve hot wings, some have multiple flavors. I can't say that I've ever had tru-smoked hot wings. Tennessee grill serves their wings hot, medium, mild, honey, and BBQ. What they don't mention on the menu is that they all start off in the smoker. The smoke carries through what ever flavor you choose! If you try anything on the menu be sure to include an order of wings."}
{"text":"SERIOUSLY AWESOME CATERING!!! 
My husband & I were referred to Tennessee Grill for catering for our wedding. We met with Bob & Angie (the owners and everything went amazing from there!! They made my wedding day SO easy & smooth with delivery, set up & pick up of the food & etc. Now to the food, YUM!!! I got so many compliments on how good the food was! We got brisket, pulled pork, pulled chicken, coleslaw, baked beans, and Mac and cheese. The feedback from our guest was awesome!! I am very happy and satisfied with our experience with The Tennessee Grill. And would recommend them to anyone & everyone!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. The brisket is amazing as well as the tacos (on tuesdays)."}
{"text":"We went in for lunch and our party of 5 enjoyed the wings,  nachos,  and sliders. All the food was delicious and the service was friendly.  Clean atmosphere was another plus. We all would be happy to come back again!"}
{"text":"A friend recommended we take the kids here since he knows I love BBQ and there aren't a lot of BBQ spots in the valley...well let's just say there's a reason for that...first sign I should've listened to was they were extremely short staffed, I believe one of the cooks was out busing tables and rolling silverware. They kept saying this isn't normal to be so busy but since we waited almost an hour to get our food I opened up yelp and read that we weren't the only ones with this experience. I'm a brisket guy so I ordered the brisket and 1/2 rack of ribs..for a bbq joint they didn't even have sausage on the menu which was strange...we also ordered pulled pork...I don't know what kind of smoker they use but everything tasted like it was cooked in the broiler...the brisket was very juicy/watery which makes me believe they keep in in a pan with juices to keep it moist instead of slicing to order...my brisket looked nothing like their YouTube video...the ribs tasted like they were cooked in the oven then placed on grill...pulled pork was aweful...again tasted like it was cooked in the oven wrapped in foil...it had no smoke flavor or seasoning...this place is known for its sauces which all had a dark liquid smoke taste to them which created even more of a challenge to taste any real \"Tennessee\" style flavor...the waitstaff was friendly for running around trying to take care of customers...we felt extremely bad for the ladies who offered to comp us a dessert which we politely declined (was afraid of how bad that would taste)...I'm sorry to the owners for a negative review but this is an honest review and this place is a \"grill\" and shouldn't boast about having the best the best smelling \"butts\" in town"}
{"text":"We had Tennessee Grill cater my dad's surprise birthday party and it was great! Bob the owner was very easy to work with and Danielle was so sweet and helpful. The pulled pork and chicken arrived hot and was so delicious. The variety of sauces for the meat were great. Everyone raved about it. Would definitely recommend and use them again in the future."}
{"text":"Pretty darned surprised at how good this little place is.  We ordered a burger and BBQ pulled pork on pretzel buns.  Wowza!  Those buns were to die for and the overall burger and pork were great.  The cole slaw and french fry sides were good, too. The place was busy during lunchtime but the two servers did a fantastic job keeping things running smoothly.  Can't wait to for the adjoining bar to open.  Anthem thanks you, Tennessee Grill."}
{"text":"Took my family here one night and I must say we were pleasantly surprised. The place is not too big and cozy enough. Food was great and plenty. Love the cheese curds! Ribs and brisket were great especially with the variety of bbq sauces available. Staff was friendly! Will be back again soon."}
{"text":"Stopped here on way through town. Excellent wings. Great service. Would definitely stop here again on next visit."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Diamond in the rough next to the Anthem Outlet. Food was delicious and people were delightful!!! A must go."}
{"text":"Really disappointed. Entrance is odd, no one greeted us. I was expecting some yummy southern food, other than ribs, there is nothing. Most women don't eat ribs because they are too messy.  Maybe even shrimp and grits, but instead there was a monte cristo or egg salad sandwich on the dinner menu ?  There is nothing interesting on the menu that I cant find somewhere else. Really unfortunate because they could be \"different\", instead of run of the mill. We left as we weren't interested in a boring meal."}
{"text":"Wow! What a find.  Special thanks to Scott H. for giving me the heads-up on this little slice of BBQ heaven.  Sorry I cant rate any of the sides, but I opted to save as much room as possible, for the all-meat BBQ platter.  I can eat veggies when I'm dead!  
Here's a rundown on the platter:
Pulled Pork Slider:  sweet, tender, and straight-out-the-crockpot-tender.  Like your Aunt Sally used to make, if you were that lucky.  
Pulled Chicken Slider:  best smoked chicken EVER!! Smoke is deep, and savory, while the meat remains succulent and tender.  If I were in the kitchen, I wouldnt be able to keep my fingers out of this stuff.  Worth getting your hand slapped for ;)
Brisket: I am not (normally) about the brisket, but this is a game changer.  Uber tender, aged beef flavor, and a nice \"crust\" around the outside.  Perfectly marbled/fatty for full flavor, without being slimey or hard to eat.  Hit it with the Bourbon sauce, close your eyes, get your Kiltlifter ready, and just drift away into your happy BBQ place ;)
Ribs:  Again, true to style, fall-apart tender, and with and intriguing rub hiding under that sweet sauce.  Gnawing on the bones now, to figure out the key flavor in the rub, but aww hell, who cares?!?!  Good excuse to gnaw on them bones!!
Hot Links:  Another home-cookin' home run.  If you've ever been blessed to know someone that makes their own sausage, you're really gonna enjoy the fine-ground texture, and easy heat in these links.  Taking thr last few morsels in a to-go box, for a midnight snack with some cheddar melted over 'em.  Jelous???!!
Rolls: sliders served on moist & tasty (potato or yeast?) rolls. Tried to cast them aside to make room for more hot links, but they still dissapeared somehow!

Aroma:  as I sit pondering this bounty, the smell of a  freshly-stoked smoker pushes me over the edge, into bbq bliss.  Half the fun of good bbq is the day-long teaser of smoke drifting around your house, knowing full well what awaits you at supper time. Antici ......................PATION!

Lookout Bigfoot BBQ!  AZ has another contender for the crown.  

Things to do in AZ:  Grand Canyon, Havasupai Falls, Blue Ridge reservoir, Kendrick Peak, and Tennessee Grill."}
{"text":"Decided to try The Tennessee Grill for lunch. I had the grilled BBQ chicken wrap. It was awesome. It came with a good sized salad and they had a ton of dressing options. The menu looked good and the owner came out and told they are expanding it very soon. I'm looking forward to returning soon. If you are looking for a solid local restaurant for lunch give them a shot."}
{"text":"Chicken literally tasted like plastic as if it had been microwaved while frozen. Rice and veggies also tasted like frozen microwave food. Beer on tap was probably the best thing about this place. No wonder it was vacant."}
{"text":"This place is to chill with some friends and eat.
I like this place soo much Quality on the food is better than good there onion rings are to die for all right this restaurant five out of five. Also the service is amazing I waited no more than 10 minutes for my food. The waiters/waitresses are very nice. You bet I'll come again.

Sincerely - Eddie



P.s everything on the menu"}
{"text":"I had the shrimp and my hubby had the brisket. Staff was nice. French fries and soup were good, but the brisket wasn't the best-maybe because we got there 30 minutes before closing. Shrimp was okay. It was quiet in there, which is great, but unfortunately the food really wasn't what we were hoping for."}
{"text":"Food was great for me. Fried Pickles and the bacon stacked BLT were Delicious! Bartender/Haley was adorable and very social as well as on point with service!"}
{"text":"My review may change depending on what else on the menu I try. I ordered the Thursday special the bitchin burger. I wouldn't recommend the burgers here. I've had way better from other places.  This place seems like they are more of a BBQ place. So when I give something else from the menu a try I'll be sure to change my review. I did notice service was kinda slow, but we weren't in any hurry. The server Sabrina B. was amazing!"}
{"text":"Decent food, sweet potato fries are really good!  Atmosphere is ok, seems like they could spice up the decor.  Menu offers basic selections, however they do have bbq items such as pulled pork and brisket.  I have had the brisket on one occasion and it was good. The buffalo chicken wrap is a good choice too.  Service is fairly good and consistant.  This place is not always my first choice, but good to mix it up on occasion."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Convenient to hotels and shopping. Good drink selection with multiple size options. I added chicken to my veggie sandwhich, and it was delicious. Check out their house cut fries! Yummy. Great service from my bartender, but he was the only one working - poor guy could have probably used a hand for the less patient customers (it was, however, only 1 hour until closing time)."}
{"text":"The standard for great BBQ in the valley is Little Miss BBQ. They do everything right, The Tennessee Grill does most everything wrong. I purchased $46 worth of baby back ribs, a brisket platter, and four sides. The baby back ribs were not actually baby back ribs. They had additional pork meat attached to them that was full of cartilage that I had to spit out. They were not dry rub ribs but had been slathered with a sticky pasty sauce. The meat was flavorless. The brisket had been chopped and mixed with a sauce. This is a sure sign someone is trying to cover up a dry or flavorless, overcooked brisket. It was shoe leather tough. The onion rings were soggy as were the sweet potato fries. The beans were as bland as any beans I've ever had. The purchase was a total bust and my wife and I tossed out most of it."}
{"text":"I use to go to this place before it change over to Tennessee Grill and the food was good. Now over the past few years this place is losing my business. Their breakfast are over priced for burnt or under cooked food. The cook can't even cook an egg correctly. As for their BBQ is not so bad but serving frozen foods is unacceptable. I feel if you're going to run a BBQ restaurant you would want to serve your customers fresh quality food. They don't cater to anyone who requires a special diet. Greasy frozen fried food. Typical bar food more less. I believe that everyone has the right to receive quality food at affordable prices not subpar food for expensive prices."}
{"text":"Had the a double sausage.  It was very good.  My significant other had the brisket, she said it melts in your mouth."}
{"text":"I liked the ambience and the wait staff were great but I was pretty disappointed in the brisket. It was dry and not tender at all.  Flavor was okay - basic pepper rub, but it was either old and dried out or not smoked well."}
{"text":"Just found out about this place 1 month ago. We have been here 3 times since! Great food!"}
{"text":"The restaurant appears clean. Staff is friendly. The out of the can tasting baked beans and the homemade cornbread were the best things on the menu. We ordered the chicken avocado bacon burger and brisket. The brisket was only ok, nothing to write home about. As per the chicken avocado burger it was adequate. In addition I wanted to try the mild wings. Have had way better at a local restaurant down the street. Could not even stomach the store bought, out of bottle ranch dressing."}
{"text":"Had dinner with my girlfriends and the place was packed! The staff took care of us with appetizers and were very attentive. I ordered the hot chick burger and it was bursting with flavor. It definitely hit the spot and was worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast, best hash browns I have had ,first time here, we are looking forward in trying lunch and dinner now. We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"The food smelled really good. Too bad we waited 10 minutes and never got seated. They appeared to be understaffed.  

Still, I hope to try again another day and see how it goes."}
{"text":"I've never been to a BBQ joint that had a Teriyaki bowl on the menu  if you want ribs go to Chili's. Poor management. The place was understaffed and the waitresses were doing the best they could given the circumstances. Ribs tasted broiled as well as the brisket, pull pork lacked smokiness and flavor. Best thing we ate was the miniature cornbread. If this place was located any closer to Phoenix they would be out of business. The 1  is for the waitresses. The BBQ sauces had WAY to much liquid smoke. We will NOT be returning."}
{"text":"We had breakfast today at The Tennessee Grill.
It's a friendly place because of the low key environment and happy, welcoming waitresses.
I love their homemade bread that's for sale, too.
I had the Classic Breakfast: 2 eggs, toast, hash browns and patty sausage.  My husband had
two eggs, hash browns, link sausage and bacon and two large pancakes.  We loved the food and highly recommend you try it.  They smoke all their own meat products--ribs, bacon etc."}
{"text":"Very good. The brisket was wonderful. The staff pleasant and helpful. Clean bathrooms a great place to have lunch today. We will be back for sure. Thanks for a great meal!"}
{"text":"Terrible visit this time. Sat for 10 minutes without a word from any staff. Finally got menus but only after we got up and asked for them. Ordered drinks and the non-alcohol drinks came pretty quickly. Never received the other drinks. Place was only 1/2 full and the empty tables weren't tended to the whole 30 minutes that we were there. Finally got tired of waiting and just left. Informed the waitress that we were upset and got another \"Sorry\". If we got ANY service as much as we were told \"Sorry\" we would have had a great night! 

This place is usually a little on the slow side but the food is always worth that. We don't need someone always at the ready but SOME service would have been awesome this night. Complete and utter fail! No excuse for this! We'll be back because it's typically pretty darned good BBQ. We WILL inform them about this visit and see how it goes. Hopefully things get better, service-wise!"}
{"text":"We tried The Tennessee Grill for lunch today and I can say without a doubt we will not be going back.  I ordered the BLT and my husband ordered a half rack of ribs.  The bacon on my BLT was soggy and tasted like it was cooked a few days ago.  My husband's ribs also tasted like they had been cooked several days ago.  The coleslaw served with the ribs was brown and tasted sour.  And for this we paid $30.00-"}
{"text":"Prime Rib Thursday is worth the trip. Very tasty and even the small portion was generous. My daughter went with her favorite, fried shrimp."}
{"text":"Wow!  The Tennessee Grill just gets better and better.  Want good barbeque? Check! Great service? Check!  A reasonable price and delicious food?  Look no further..."}
{"text":"What a great place! 
Just passing through on our way out west and decided to stop for breakfast. 
The food was absolutely fabulous, and earned major points for having almond milk lattes!

The service was spectacular, prompt, friendly and courteous. The food was fresh, hot, and delicious. I loved every bite of my breakfast burrito, my husband loved his scramble, our 3 year old loved his french toast w/whip cream and our 1yr old loved his scrambled eggs, sausage and toast. 

The price was appropriate and we'd highly recommend Tennessee Grill to everyone passing through or not. In fact, we enjoyed it so much we're making it a stop on our way back home!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on the way to Sedona. The food was great. I thoroughly enjoyed the combo of pulled pork and chicken with a cold beer. Friendly staff and very affordable. We will visit again!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch and had the pulled pork sandwich and fries. Was pleased with the sandwich and the service. The other menu options looked good and would be worth trying. I would come back again."}
{"text":"Pretty straightforward menu. Monte Cristo was lacking as it seemed to be French Toast with sliced meat in the middle and extremely soggy. Best portion was the baked beans that had a sweet and tangy flavor to them and the Twister Fries.  I recommend them over the regular fries any day of the week.  Table service was attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"We meet here on a regular basis.  I have liked everything on the menu so far and have even ordered a slight variation of something on the menu and it came out great!  The staff and owner are wonderful.  I would highly recommend eating at the Tennessee Grill.  Love the pretzel bread!!"}
{"text":"Food was horrible.  Had a smoked Turkey sandwich.  The bun was hard as a rock and there might have been a half ounce of Turkey on the rock hard bun."}
{"text":"Tasty and authentic BBQ. The brisket plate was fabulous. Service was excellent as well"}
{"text":"When I looked at the menu, I thought everything was overpriced. But when my food came, very quickly, I might add, it was well worth every dime. The size of the meal better than justified the price, not to mention that it was so tender and delicious. The waitress was very attentive too. I only stopped next door to replace a blown tire and chose to eat while I waited. I am very glad to have found this place. Awesome!"}
{"text":"Very less than impressed..  The sides were portioned very small, and the place offers no corn of any kinda, not regular, not on the cob, nothing.  So strange for a BBQ joint.  I spent almost $100 for dinner for my family and no one left happy.  Brisket: zero fat content, cut far too thick to enjoy, pretty tough, fairly flavorless.  Potato salad:  Not terrible, but full sized pepper corns in it that make it a bit like chewing on seeds.  Cole Slaw:  Looks good, tastes like cabbage, fairly flavorless.  Pork Ribs:  Very tender, fell off bone, but not a lot of flavor..  Regular Fries:  Good flavor, but a little stale.  They were the best part of my meal (which is kinda sad for a BBQ place).  Mac N Cheese:  My son's comment was \"its just noodles.. theres no flavor.\"  And visually they looked exactly like a 99 cent box of mac n cheese from walmart.  I don't usually leave bad reviews unless its pretty darn bad.  After this meal I felt like I got pick pocketed for $100."}
{"text":"Decent, basic, but fairly boring menu.  There are much better options in Anthem.  The water tasted funny... which made me question the cleanliness of their ice machine. We told our server about out check-in discount (yay yelp!), but she neglected to take it off the bill. It seemed silly to wait around for the 90¢, so we just left without it.  Keep looking - explore the better options around!"}
{"text":"We had a group of 12 all ordering different items off the menu and everyone loved it! The Cornbread was gone before it hit the table. We ordered a couple baskets of the slow smoked wings, I could have eaten those all night! 

All the meat was tender and very flavorful. The BBQ sauces were great. I would highly recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"Love this place... food is great.... the Brisket, Bacon and Bleu salad is very good! Everyone there is friendly, very comfortable atmosphere... highly recommend."}
{"text":"Due to illness I haven't been back here since 7/30/13. So my wife Carol and I decided to take a ride and head up to Anthem for dinner. As I opened the door to the restaurant I was met by an odor that permeated the restaurant. It was the delicious aroma of barbeque. OMG it smelled so good. Not only that but as we entered I was immediately greeted by Bob Adler who said \"Hello Morris\".  To say I was shocked is an understatement because like I said I had not been back here since July. Talk about being impressed! This is just one reason I love this mom and pop establishment.

Anyway getting back to my review. My wife and I went there to try their all-you-can-eat fish. But that barbeque sure smelt good. In the end we both decided to try the fish. 

Our entrées came with two side dishes.We had several choices for our side dish but we went with  cottage cheese and a dinner salad. The fish also came with two hush puppies. 

Our waitress (I didn't get her name) was extremely friendly and attentive. After a bit Bob came over and asked how we liked the fish. I said \"read about it on YELP\". You should have seen his face. I let him hang and then told him what I thought.

The fish was moist, tender and flaky.They have their batter perfected. It was different from anything I've had before. I can't really describe it so you'll just have to try it. I can say it was crispy and oh so flavorful. The cod was cooked just right. Being cod you could tell it was fresh because it didn't taste fishy. It was wonderfully crispy and golden on the outside, fluffy as a pillow and moist on the inside.  Perfectly cooked fish 

As we concluded our meal my wife decided to get a slice of their berry pie alamode (Vanilla Bean ice cream). I asked for an extra spoon so I could try a bite. The first thing that hit me about the pie is it tasted and looked \"home made\". It was divine. I mean it was mouthwatering scrumptious.

Back to that wonderful odor we smelt upon entering. We have to go back and try the barbeque. That smell was so tempting I have to try it so we'll be back.

FOOD: Portions are great, food taste spectacular. SERVICE: The customer service is so sincere and personable. CONCLUSION: As you know I rarely give a restaurant a 5 rating. They got a 5 from me last time I was there and I was pleased they still deserved a 5 again. To get that from me there has to be a WOW factor and this place has it. It is a relaxed place where you can enjoy a good meal with good friends. The best thing going for this place, after the food of course, is the owners. They are genuinely nice people and deserve your business. I'm definitely a fan. RETURN FACTOR: 100%]

************************* What does my OVERALL rating mean?*************************

5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well! 
4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business. 
3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again. 
2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family. 
1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISHMENT"}
{"text":"I'm always wary of Anthem restaurants as they seem to come and go.  This was a surprising treat.  My buffalo chicken wrap was extremely tasty and did not taste like it was assembled from frozen Costco ingredients.  My husband enjoyed his meal as well.  The red velvet cake was good although it was a bit dry and the frosting too sweet for my tastes.  

The menu is strangely electric and I read (I think here on Yelp?) that it was the dream of several restaurant managers who used to get together and barbeque.  The menu is reflective of the things they used to cook together.  

All in all, cute place and I'm looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"First the good. The meat was cooked very well and was tender. The bartender/server did an exceptional job and was very friendly. Now the iffy. I have lived in Tennessee and South Carolina and this didn't fit for bbq there. I don't know this area of Arizona, but for a place called the Tennessee grill and bar the menu was to uppity for me. The choices of bbq were not something I'd find in Tennessee except for the standard sauce. Decent but the coleslaw was dry as a bone something called the Tennessee Grill I expect creamy creamy coleslaw. Don't get me wrong this place has a nice atmosphere, friendly staff and good food.  it's just when you go to a place expecting Tennessee barbecue it under performs in that aspect."}
{"text":"I had a poor experience.  As a repeat customer, I got an email asking about my meal.  I told them my concerns.  They chose not to reply.  I guess they don't need anymore business!"}
{"text":"Love this place,best brisket ever,the place is very clean and the service  is awesome.. thanks Tennessee grill for the amazing  job"}
{"text":"I've eaten here often under the old owners, one of my favorite breakfasts in Anthem. It will be interesting to see the direction the menu takes with the new owner. I'm looking forward to trying his Tennessee BBQ sauce on my next visit.

Shout out to the new owner, a genuine nice guy. When diners next to me paid their bill and made to leave they asked him for ice ... but it was to fill the cooler in their car! Well, I wondered what I'd say if I were the owner, after all a convenience store sits half a block away, and his ice dispenser wasn't large in size. Only part of a soda machine.

He was so very nice to the people and filled up several containers for them to fill the cooler. If the BBQ is as good as this business owner is nice, this place will a big hit."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here this evening and it was Fantastic. We split a rack of baby back ribs and a Greek salad. The ribs were smoky, tender and just had an overall great flavor. They bring you a sweet sauce and a spicy. I had the sweet, which had a little bit of a kick too it. Really tasty. My husband had the spicy and loved it. The owners are super nice, ensuring we had everything we needed and our waitress was very attentive as well. On the way out I couldn't resist getting their oatmeal coconut cookies. Wow!  It is so nice to have a family run business close by that serves breakfast lunch and dinner. Great job, Tennessee Grill!  We'll see you soon!"}
{"text":"My beef brisket was yummy. Love their selection of sauces. 
Didn't care for the coleslaw. 
Hubby had the pork and said it was a little dry. 
Will try them again. 
Great bar menu."}
{"text":"We had a great family dinner at the Tennessee grill. Not only was the location perfect for our (10 people) family reunion but the atmosphere and the food were terrific. 
Jen, our lively and very patient server, turned was a real gem. She accommodated all of our requests with good humor and efficiency. 
My ribs and brisket and the side dishes and the appetizers were all just fine"}
{"text":"I took my family for a needed meal, we were all famished. I had a Caesar salad and it was excellent. Everyone else commented that they were satisfied with their order. Service was very good."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best place to eat Breakfast in Anthem. The bacon is to die for and honestly every thing they make that I have had is delicious.  The service is very good as well. The only knock is pricing. It is fair, but a little expensive,  especially for breakfast."}
{"text":"Excellent wait staff, excellent food.  You HAVE to try their house made bacon!

Did I mention BACON????"}
{"text":"Ordered breakfast from here the other morning after work. When I arrived to pick up my order (the southerner) the restaurant smelled like the bbq place it is... which lead me to adding a side of brisket to my breakfast order. My favorite part of my meal was the biscuits and gravy. The biscuit is perfectly soft and flakey. Even reheated it still is amazing. I like my gravy a little bit more spicy but i just add a little pepper and the gravy is perfect. The brisket was good but not the best I've ever had- I feel that I never can give bbq places a fair review though because the first bbq place I tried in the valley was Little Miss and now no one can live up. However, their bbq sauce was great. Sweet with just a little bit of heat. I will definitely keep coming back to this place."}
{"text":"Great place to eat for breakfast or lunch in Anthem. I had an amazing burger today that was perfectly cooked medium rare on a gorgeous brioche bun--so yummy! Friendly service, quality food and reasonable prices. Skip the chain restaurants and go to Tennessee Grill!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try out the Tennessee Grill last Sunday after seeing the ads for it and reading these reviews. We used a Yelp! certificate as well, so that made it easier on the pocketbook. We had been to the previous iterations of restaurants in this location and as the owner has stated, much is still the same in terms of menu and decoration as the old Cafe Aroma - but there are a few new items on the menu to give a sneak peek to the new menu (more BBQ oriented). I tried one of the new items, the pulled chicken sandwich on a pretzel roll. I have never had Tennessee style BBQ sauce before but I liked it - it is thinner and more vinegary than Texas or KC BBQ sauve. There was an abundant amount of pulled chicken and you got a side of the sauce so you could put on as much as you wanted - I like that I can control the amount of sauce, not the person in the kitchen. The pretzel roll was nice and chewy and warm. I just got chips as the side - your choice out of packaged Lay's or Fritos chips. But there were several other options to choose from. My husband got one of the \"old\" menu items, a turkey bacon wrap and he added avocado. This wrap is huge - he honestly got three meals out of it! The fries were hot and crispy as well. The server was friendly and efficient and even asked if we would like a bowl of water for our service dog. We didn't try and of the baked goods but I checked them out in the case and they look very tasty. The bagels are also huge! All in all a good experience and a nice place for a Sunday lunch. I'm looking forward to the new menu and decor once the change is complete."}
{"text":"Nice place, clean and servers are friendly. Pork was really good, nice variety of BBQ sauces. Totally unexpected that they make their own fruit smoothies, Acái was delish."}
{"text":"As prepared as I was to give this place a 5 star review, when I received my check and saw that I was charged for refills, it definitely bumped Tennessee Grill down a peg. Who doesn't give free refills on fountain drinks and iced tea anymore? 

The food was quite good. Loved the house made potato salad and the fresh cut Tornado fries. The chicken wrap I had was WONDERFUL. The pulled pork was tender albeit a bit dry. Tennessee Grill prefers you dress your own bbq..which is fine but keep the pork in its juices or something. 

We will go back in the future and just have water for drinks but definitely will do more exploring of the menu."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I moved to Anthem recently, We have tried a few places and they were all ok but yesterday we went to get our oil changed and walked around the area. We found this hidden gem the Tennessee Grille. We went to the bar where we love to sit and we had the most friendly,  professional, patient and helpful bartender I have ever met. I have been a bartender for over 20 years and I have never experienced such outstanding customer service from such a young man. Brandon you are amazing thank you for making this place our new favorite place, we are going to recommend you to all of our friends and family!!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in the brisket sandwich.  I love brisket but I never saw meat that looked liked this.  Apparently is was overcooked and should have been disposed of instead of severed.  The cole slaw was just so so and I expected something better because they must serve alot of it.  The service was slow and the waitress was uninterested in us.  I won't go back."}
{"text":"Great place! BBQ ribs tasty and with meat falling off the bone. Service is speedy and friendly."}
{"text":"So we've gone here a few times the food has always been great and the service just ok. Today we took family from out of state to try it. First it took about 10 min for the waitress even to acknowledge us. Then we placed two appetizer orders one came out right away and the other came with our food. Appetizers need to be served before the meal. Then we had to keep reminding the waitress to fill up our drinks and get sauce for our food. I had to send my food back because it was cold. Then I got charged an extra $2 on my ticket for a special bun that I didn't even order. Then they put an appetizer on our receipt that should have been on our other families ticket. Very unorganized place. My husband says we are never going back."}
{"text":"An interesting break from chain restaurants. Good selection of adult beverages coupled with country comfort food."}
{"text":"I could not have disliked his place more. I stopped in for a quick lunch based on the reviews and was very disappointed. I ordered the hot link platter (not on the online menu, odd) which came out with two small links filleted open, and when I took a bite, they were very hard and slightly burnt. Not from the area, but visit frequently; I won't be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Just like Morris' review... The wonderful smell of barbecue permeated the air when we walked into Tennessee Grill! It was our first time there, no doubt our last, as we were just passing thru while driving from Sedona to the airport in Phoenix.
Service was SO SLOW & it certainly was not crowded, maybe there was a large take out order!  I had a tuna sand which, it was very FAIR & they were out of potato chips!! My buddy had a chicken wrap, he said it was nothing special!
Sorry about the review because the owner was so friendly as we're the servers!"}
{"text":"The Tennessee Grill has very tasty BBQ and a nice bar. This restaurant is unique and is not a franchise.  Seating has very comfy tables.  The wait staff is friendly and efficient.  It is a hit in Anthem."}
{"text":"Our family has eaten here many times for breakfast and have NEVER been disappointed.  I love their hash browns and home fries both. You can tell they are fresh potatoes and not frozen.  Their potato style is different than other places but much better and fresh.  

My son LOVES their biscuit and gravy.  He licks up the gravy it is so good.  Pancakes are huge and yummy.  French toast is made out of their wonderful homemade bread.  Did I mention the homemade cinnamon rolls? 

What I love most is the freshness and quality of their ingredients.  They are trying to do it right instead of cheating the customer with frozen quality food.  If their breakfast is this good, I cannot wait to try their dinner. 

Good luck The Tennessee Grill and welcome to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Such a wonderful surprise. Food was delicious, quick, robust menu. We loved the bbq sliders. All of them!  We were just looking for somewhere to stop on a road trip and needed quick but high quality. We were not disappointed! Friendly service and owner is sweet and attentive."}
{"text":"Great barbecue! Many choices on their menu. Loved the brisket sandwich with their sweet barbecue sauce. Yum!"}
{"text":"We had the rib and brisket combo to share between my husband and myself and it was delicious.  Service was fast and the place smelled amazing with all of that meat cooking.  Make sure to stop by if your in the mood for some flavorful tender meat."}
{"text":"I've eaten at quite a few BBQ places recently, and this one is definitely the worst.  It's not terrible, but by comparison it's at the low end.  I ordered the pulled chicken sandwich.  First, the meat was very dry.  Second, the amount of meat they provide is absolutely pathetic. Their pretzel rolls are excellent, but there was more than twice as much roll vs meat.  Not a good ratio.  I will give them kudos on the sweet potato fries. Some of the best I've ever had.  But it wasn't enough to make up for a very disappointing BBQ sandwich.  Also not a good place to come if you hate country music."}
{"text":"I love the fact that I can get breakfast at lunch time. My favorite lunch dish, however, is the Dijon Pecan Salad. I have eaten here often, both on my own and in a group, and the service has always been first rate!"}
{"text":"Well.... so much for having a local bbq/bar to enjoy.  Two trips in a row where service was just horable.  Sorry to say won't be eating here anymore.  Friday fish fry good luck getting a second serving... started cleaning in the table before we were asked if we wanted a box for our overpriced bbq put napkins on our food. Oh well back to pork on a fork"}
{"text":"We ate lunch here on one of the days that we were visiting in the area. The food did not disappoint. My husband and sons had burgers and all agreed they were delicious. I had the chicken bacon and avocado sandwich and it was also very good. The atmosphere was inviting and our waitress was attentive. The portions were very large so we felt like we got good value for our money.  We all had pretzel buns and I have to admit it was not my favorite (which is the reason for the four stars) but this is probably a preference thing as my husband and sons enjoyed theirs."}
{"text":"So disappointed usually the food is fast hot and service is great. Tonight after walking in after music in May at Anthem Park with out of town family we thought we would enjoy BNQ well not tonight. We walked into a half empty restaurant to be made to wait 15 minutes for a table once set it took us an. Hour to get our meals and then they were not even good."}
{"text":"So let me start off by saying that I love BBQ and smoke my own ribs/brisket/pork butt. This place did not disappoint but I have had better. Nevertheless, I ordered the ribs and brisket meal with fries and tater tots. The ribs were cooled perfectly. They pulled right off the bone and it was tender as heck. They are dry cooked and you add sauce after. The dry rub wasn't as sweet as I'm used to but had a great flavor. The brisket was wet and soaked in sauce. I prefer my brisket sliced and not chopped so that was a big negative for me. I ate it all though because they were pretty good. My son had the pulled pork sandwich amd it was exploding off his sandwich. It was pretty tasty, no complaints. 

The waitress was polite and was very personable. We did go dry on our drinks a few times but I understand that she got busy. The restaurant was nice looking and clean. It also smelled heavenly. 

Lastly, they have some cool tee shirts and if you wear one to the restaurant you get 10% off your meal."}
{"text":"We eat here 1-2 times per week.  We love the food, atmosphere (relaxed), and that the servers recognize us and get our iced tea before asked.  We love the breakfasts (me, bacon; husband, sausage)..  While we miss the in-house baked bread, NOT having it is better for our diets!

Speaking of diets, while there are many temptations, the servers are supportive.  We ask to hold the potatoes and toast, and to substitute low carb fruit.  No problem--we get cantaloupe, perhaps with berries.  Perfect!  

We love the BBQ and have gotten take-out several times.  This week we  had a couple dinners with their brisket--great!  When we have had company in town, we did a BBQ night at home with ribs, pulled chicken and pork, brisket and more.  All agreed it was great (and we didn't have to cook).  

Thanks to the servers for the excellent attention and help always....  

P.S. If you are on the road, it's right off the freeway by the Anthem Outlets--easy on, easy off, and back on your way.  We might see you there."}
{"text":"Moved to Phx from Austin Texas. Besides Rudy's that expanded out to phx I have had a hard time finding good BBQ. Just found my BBQ place and am so happy. Everything was great and will be back 100%.
They have home made BBQ sauces and they were all great. Even the side salad was fresh and taste.
To say the least I'm pumped.
BBQ in Arizona!!!!!!!
Thanks again yelp!!!!"}
{"text":"The side salads that came with our sandwiches were very good and above average made with very yummy assorted house made croutons. 

My husband tried the pulled pork sandwich on house made pretzel bun. He said the pork it's self was good but the bun was very dense and was absolutely burnt black on the bottom and not edible. We showed the bun to our server and she apologized and said she could get something else. I'm sure it's not typical that the pretzel rolls are black and burnt on the bottom but the day we were here we got one.

I tried the reuben on house made marble rye bread. The bread looked really good but the sandwich is Arizona Style Reuben. That means the rye is very mild and lacks the texture, sour and seeds. It was still a GOOD house made bread but not the style I prefer. The corned beef was that super lean style meat and is the kind that's hard to heat up as the meat turned hard.

I do note many people do prefer a Reuben in this style so for those people it might be a five star sandwich. 

I will give the Tennessee Grill another try next time I'm by the  Anthem Outlets and I hope to up them a star because they have tons of potential and are better than the Anthem food court.

The Tennessee Grill is located across the Street from the Anthem Outlets."}
{"text":"My husband and I went on a Friday and we both had the all you can eat fish fry.  The staff was awesome!  Everyone was friendly.  It did take a while to place the order and it took quite a while to get our food.  I was surprised because I thought they would just be making fish pretty much non-stop.  When our food came, I was happy with how it looked.  The fish was nice and meaty.  I thought the breading was too heavy.  You only got a small handful of fries, but they were good.  The hushpuppy was cold and dry and not very flavorful.  The slaw wasn't very good either.  We shared a dessert.  It was some type of cherry cheesecake with chocolate on top.  It was pretty good.  I was bummed they used maraschino cherries instead of fresh cherries.  It might have just been an off night.  We are going to go back on the Prime Rib night and try it.  I will update at that time."}
{"text":"Pretty awful service.. we walked in on a random Monday night and were not greeted when we walked in. I sat myself and had to ask for a menu. We waited for 15 min and I eventually had to ask for someone to take our order. We literally ordered a quesadilla, some fries and a beer. The beer never came and I had to remind someone... again! The server came over another 15 min later and told us their system was broken so everything was taking longer than expected but that our food should be ready in 10 min. I had my toddler with us and after another 20 min he was getting very antsy, so I asked someone for fries or crackers or something to keep him happy. Our food took another 5-10 min and was ok once it came, definitely not worth over an hour wait.... i could have gone to del taco for a quarter of the bill and wait. I won't be back here again. The manager could have comped something off our bill or at least came to our table to our table to apologize."}
{"text":"We paid another visit here and it's had a MAJOR change. The food is pretty amazing. I have their Brisket Pita on a regular basis, something that wasn't on the menu when we originally went there to eat. 

Lots of options and would place this as one of the best places for BBQ in Phoenix. And trust me, I know my BBQ. 

Really happy to see the additions and growth there."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! We had the Shrimp Louis Salad, Chicken Pecan Dijon Salad, and Pork and Brisket Sliders with the homemade BBQ sauces. Excellent food! Kyle M was our server and was warm, friendly and gave great service! Would definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Amazing bbq.  Good people too.  I've had three or four different meals and they're all great. Love it"}
{"text":"Good burger & fries. Will have to come back for the BBQ. Good service, clean & not too loud. Try it out."}
{"text":"We had a store function and they catered our whole event ! The food was awesome and a big hit ! Thank you Bob!!!!!  Tramonto Home Depot 6948. Give back to the community !!!"}
{"text":"I had my first experience at Tennessee grill today, the food was good but the coffee from \"you got brewed\" was the highlight. Great people and a good atmosphere"}
{"text":"I went back to The Tenn Grill yesterday and they made me a delicious Rueben sandwhich. Thank you for your attentiveness!!"}
{"text":"Great food great staff and awesome prices. My mother in law said the ribs are the best she ever had.  BTW the baked goods are amazing.  I asked the owner Friday when is the next time you are going to have cinnamon rolls.  He said on Sunday he will make sure to have some.. Sure enough I go for breakfast and they have cinnamon rolls.  They are so big you can share it with someone and still have leftovers.  Great place to have in Anthem."}
{"text":"Great food for a very economical price. The staff is very friendly & I'd love to bring my entire family in to experience it."}
{"text":"I knew about the restaurant portion but did not realize there was bar.. until today! Bob and Tiffany are super sweet- thanks for the great experience!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and great customer service. Love they they will bring my food down to my Salon down the way when I am super busy. They always put the customer first and their food is amazing. Love that they added the bar and always keeping things fresh and new. One of the best places to eat in Anthem :)"}
{"text":"Tried Tennessee grill last night. Corn bread was very good as was the ribs, and taste of burger. would not order the poppers again. I was some what concerned when the bill came. It seems they add a Prop 206 tax on top of sales tax. No where  else I have been does this. I think it stinks that they don't let you know before hand and 2 why isn't it just added into the cost after all a burger is already $14.Prices are not cheap but to have add ons sucks. I am torn rather i will return"}
{"text":"I visited here about two weeks ago for brunch with my family. I ordered one of their skillets and was extremely pleased with my order. Not only was the food excellent, I felt like the restaurant environment was welcoming and perfect for a comfortable meal! I definitely plan on returning next time I'm in Anthem!"}
{"text":"The brisket, bacon and blue salad is da bomb!  Service has been great during both lunch and dinner.  The hubs had the fish fry on Friday night and loved it."}
{"text":"Great ribs are very meaty and tasty sauce. I like the red potato salad and we tried the sweet potato fries which were excellent. Friendly service and nice clean location across from the Anthem markets. This was my 2nd visit and I will return."}
{"text":"I have heard good things about this BBQ joint the food that is but was told the service is so so. I figured I would give it a try last night. I came in and was behind another couple . There was only two tables occupied on the restaurant side . After a couple of minutes the server came up and seated the guests ahead of me in the bar . Another 5 min goes by and the bartender asks if we are being helped I didn't want to throw the server under the bus so I said I am sure she will be back . Server hears this and says she will be with us after she makes some drinks goes behind the bar and starts making mojitos . After another 5-10 minutes she walks right past us again to settle one of the two tables she is working. I get she may have been new and maybe I should have gone in for drinks and not dinner the bartender looked like she was experienced but I really wanted to try their BBQ . I will try again sometime in the future if they are still there probably because their isn't much up in anthem but otherwise I will continue to sample other bbq in the valley.,,, FYI the owner seams to not take criticism well my wife posted a review as well and was shamed for it . I am simply hoping the owner who evidently takes care in his bbq would try and get his staff to do the same.There isn't a lot of good food up here and we can use a good place to eat ."}
{"text":"Awesome food and server Kyle...he was hilarious!!  Great happy hour 1/2 off alcohol!!  Whats not to love??"}
{"text":"Ate here for breakfast, have to say I was slightly disappointed. The staff was friendly, restaurant was nice and neat decor, but the food was completely blah. I had a breakfast burrito with absolutely zero flavor. The only way I could eat it was drenching it in salsa, sour cream, and salt. Unfortunately it doesn't seem like any seasoning was used on my shredded port when cooking it. The burrito came with a side of home potato's and they too were just plain tasteless. Over cooked, dry, and zero flavor. 

Debating wether to go back and try something different to give them a second chance."}
{"text":"Nice place really clean and welcoming. I had the pork brisket sliders and they were delicious. You are given a selection of 4 BBQ (made in house) sauces to add to your BBQ and all four were quite tasty. Can't wait to go back and try some of their other dishes especially the ribs. All in all a nice place for some smoked BBQ."}
{"text":"Took my sister and daughter here for lunch the other day...we really enjoyed it! My daughter got the homemade chicken noodle soup, it was really delicious. I got the reuben sandwich with fruit and my sister got the gyro sandwich...both were tasty and the fruit was really fresh.  The owner even came over to check on us and he was very gracious. They sell fresh baked bread in the bakery area, so I got a cinnamon swirl loaf to take home which made awesome french toast!  :)"}
{"text":"We were on the way home.  I yelp restaurants and this one had quite a few reviews with a 4 Star. They wings were really good they brought them naket and you could put 4 different bbq sauces on them. The waitress told us the wings are smoked for 14 hours. The ribs were also smoked and the bone just falls off the meat. Very good."}
{"text":"Just had the Brisket plate with fries and slaw. It was excellent, tender and lean with the spicy BBQ sauce it was fantastic. I was hungry and it was just the right amount of food, full but not stuffed."}
{"text":"September 2, 2016.   Checked out their menu via their webpage before deciding to drive up from Peoria.  On-line menu listed the BBQ Sampler for $13.99.  However when I got to the restaurant to order the price was showing $15.99 on the menu.  I pointed out the discrepancy to the waiter Danny who said something like we have a \"Disclaimer\" on our website for issues like that and refused to give me the lower price.  Bad, bad business to do something like that.  Borders False Advertising.  It was only 2 bucks.  So it wasn't the money, but was point of the matter they chose not to do the right thing.   The dinners come with nothing, everything else has to be ordered a la-carte for an extra price.  Really??   I thought Ruth Chris' Steakhouse was the only one that did that,  and I don't go there anymore.   After submitting our order 15 - 20 minutes passed without receiving any food.  Danny came back over to our table and apologized saying somehow they had lost our order and it was never submitted.  I was going to ask him to check the \"Disclaimer\" section, but thought better of it.   However, as a nice touch they brought over a small pan of cornbread and butter while we waited that was pretty good.   The BBQ Sampler was huge!  More than enough for two people.  They definitely aren't stingy when it comes to piling on the food.  And, the food was in the excellent range.  Four different types of BBQ sauce at the table.  The Bourbon flavor was tops.  I couldn't eat it all and had to do a doggie bag.          Other issues to point out....  no paper towels in the men's room.  Had to use toilet paper to dry my hands off with.  Hate doing that.   Also, on the door as you leave the bar area to the West is a large sign asking to please give a 5 Star Rating review. And if that's not possible to let any staff member know so they can correct the issue.   Well, I think the owners meant well when they took the time to post that, but it was obviously not the case in our particular situation.   So... to owner Bob Alder.  Keep up the good work and serving the excellent food, but you guys need to do some fine tuning on your website and bathroom upkeep.   A Four is the best I can offer today.   Best wishes.  Chris M. Peoria, AZ

I have photos of the on-line menu and our bill showing the discrepancies, but I don't see a way to post those to this page."}
{"text":"First and last visit. The menu is a cluttered mess even though it looks like someone was attempting to be organized(lighten up). The food was over slightly over cooked which wasn't a major deal, but the fried food all taste like they recently had a fish fry. When we didn't finish our meal they offered a 10% for the inconvenience. The waitress was nice but she fed us the same line about the food coming out slow as the customer before us, had there been more than 6 people in the restaurant I'd understood. I recommend the del taco next door , at least when their food is bad it only cost you 6$."}
{"text":"Great service! Lil' Jen suggested I have a birthday party there and it was so fun! Great Brisket!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for breakfast, I must say I loved the brisket in my breakfast skillet. Very tasty, I'll be back again. I also noticed they do a Friday night fish fry. Can't wait to try it"}
{"text":"Found this place coming back from Sedona. Food is average but their sweet potato fries were great. Decor could use some work. Service was good. I would come back"}
{"text":"Wow.....Wife and I went there for lunch today- talk about a place that needs the help of Chef Gordon Ramsey from Hells Kitchen!

Food took forever to get- literally.  We were there an hour.  When it finally arrived- 'groase'.  My Cole Slaw was warm as though it had been out in the kitchen all day.  Tasted like a warm dishrag smells!  Pulled Pork was soggy and bland.  At least the Diet Soda I had was good.......

Waitress was attentive and nice.  Kitchen needs help.  Wasn't worth the $40 we spent on lunch."}
{"text":"Disgusting Food !!!  Slow service !!! Waste of money.. I'm not coming back. All three dishes were bad, we left it almost untouched except French fries which was ok"}
{"text":"We had The Tennessee Grill cater an event for us on Saturday -- they were very professional in the service and the food was over the top!!!  Thank you to the staff who made my job of feeding the group easy.  Will most definitely cater though them again when the time comes."}
{"text":"They serve fish on Fridays and it's absolutely delicious! The batter and crust is very crunchy and not greasy at all. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"My favorite favorite dinner in Anthem! Their burgers and BBQ are delicious! I'll be back for sure"}
{"text":"Very friendly service staff and the food was pretty good. Got the brisket and tried all their different sauces with it, bourbon was my favorite. I wish I could have got a little bit more food for the price, but I eat a lot. They also have a coffee and little ice cream parlor in there as well."}
{"text":"Ordered the Chicken Pecan salad. Would have been a lot better if they used real greens instead of cheap iceberg lettuce with no nutritional value. The rest of the salad was real good!"}
{"text":"YES......it is really that good!

Food quality was top notch.....service was AWESOME!   Prices were on point......Dinner for 2 (with tons of leftovers).....$35 !!!    We ordered a Club sandwich with twister fries and a BBQ platter (comes with 2 sides).  The BBQ beans have this smoky flavor, but not too powerful.

*********You must try the mini cornbread topped with smoked bacon**********  

Our server was this adorable high school girl.......so friendly and helpful.......her name was Gevana (if I remember correctly).     We grabbed a menu on the way out and plan on doing the breakfast menu next.  

As far as the restaurant goes......it was CLEAN!!!!!   Stop in here.....you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ and breakfast spot. Several options for sauce flavors, all of which are good. They have a small outdoor patio that is dog friendly."}
{"text":"They had the best wings ever up till about a month ago. I'm going to give them one more try."}
{"text":"1/2 lb burger \"Bob's Bitchin' Burger. Great!

Laura got the brisket/pulled pork sliders. EXCELLENT! (Her words). B$

PS: Our server Alyssa is a doll."}
{"text":"Nothin' to write home about. My husband had the brisket sandwich, not particularly very large. He didn't like any of the sauces. The meat was very greasy, which gathered on the plate. The beans tasted like they were just out of a can. My \"bitchin' burger\" came overcooked, and nothing special at all about that. Bring your credit card, the meal with 2 beers was $55."}
{"text":"Mighty tasty.   Had the brisket sliders.   4 different BBQ sauces.  I preferred the zinger sauce but all 4 were great.  


We both had the brisket, bleu cheese, bacon salads.  

Very good.  Excellent BBQ here in the desert"}
{"text":"Of course it helps that I have been to the sister restaurant in San Francisco, but the staff is friendly and the food is good!  the only issue with dining here is that there is limited parking unless you go around the other side of the building where other businesses share the lot"}
{"text":"This lunch was awesome. ... had the BBQ sampler with baked beans and potato salad...could not finish it all not that I didn't want to, was a lot of great food.  Service was excellent. Will return next time I am in Arizona with out a doubt"}
{"text":"When I walked in it seemed very cramped. Tables where too close together and felt I was on top of the person sitting next to me. The service and food was good however the food was a little expensive. They charge you extra for cheese, bacon and bun. I will look for another less expensive option next time."}
{"text":"Had a yummy breakfast!  I had the special of waffle and strawberries and my daughter had the breakfast burrito that she said was wonderful!
Service was great!"}
{"text":"Have only been to newly named place two times, as this location has had different owners pursuing different goals.
Our first breakfast we ate there was good.  Typical egg, toast, potatoes, etc.
Coffee is good.  I think Cracker Barrel may be just as good.  HOWEVER, their bread products are freshly made there.  They have the best bagels I have ever had.  I just wish they would kick it up a notch on the cream cheese.  Kraft cream cheese packets?? Seems cheesy, sorry for pun.  They could almost have a profitable business pushing the bagels out the door.  Hot Bagels and Deli does it everyday on Carefree Highway.  
We hope they can sustain a few years.  Nice to have a little variety in this tiny little town."}
{"text":"That is good BBQ. The potatos were way under done in the potato salad but I could not stop eating it. The sauce with scalions and thick bacon had to be eaten. They even have a bakery so you can get fresh bread to go but we ate half the loaf before we left. Yeah we will be back. Great staff and good food."}
{"text":"We are her about a month or so ago and it was at around 5pm. I loved it because it wasn't packed and busy! There were only a few tables in there but hey, it worked for us.lol they had good options for their food, I LOVE that they serve breakfast all day long! (Not being like Denny's, it was better). They had quite a few different types of food which we liked since I love breakfast, and the fiancé loves meat! Our 2yr old had plenty of options for her to eat. The service was great, everyone is so friendly. The best part is they play old school country that I grew up listening to ie: Garth, Alan Jackson, Gary Allen, George Straight.... the list goes on so that put me in an extra better mood. I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Everything was great. Mozzarella sticks, brisket, fries, wings - we tried across the gamut and were not disappointed.  Waitresses are super fast and food came out in about 5 minutes after ordering.  Restaurant side was full and still no service complaints.  Will be back, and bringing friends!!"}
{"text":"Recently had an event catered by them-excellent!  The owner and staff followed up and asked if all was ok.  BBQ is like Mexican-everyone has there own opinions - but I think it's good.  I actually had the health inspector at my business the day of our event.  We told him where we got the food from (the whole place smelled like BBQ).  He said that the owner goes the extra mile when it comes to his food there-that says a lot in itself."}
{"text":"This review will be short and sweet. I came for one thing and one dish only! The brisket. I have reviewed brisket all over the USA. I am partial to the sauces of Tennessee and North Carolina. This place  has by far the best brisket I have ever tasted. If you are within 100 miles of this place... Head this way! I bet they have other stuff too."}
{"text":"Love the Barby at the Tennessee Grill.  They are located in the commerce park in Anthem very close to my business.  Whenever I have a lunch meeting I take them to the TG because the food is great, service fast, and the surrounding are quiet even tho there are lots of people there.  Bob has a great restaurant there."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here for lunch on our drive from Flagstaff to Phoenix.  I specifically wanted a big, hearty salad and a pint of hard cider and this place hit the spot!  Curtis took care of us in the bar area.  Excellent service.  I ordered the brisket & bleu salad and my husband had the wings.  Both entrees were absolutely delicious.  The salad was huge and the meats were outstanding."}
{"text":"We ordered the ribs and a burger and they were fabulous. Onion rings were awesome. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I have to say they have some of the best chicken wings I have had to pleasure of eating. They smoke them then fry. Great also nachos are delicious. Make this a stop and you will enjoy your visit."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the food and customer service.  I ordered the brisket and what I was served was full of fat, more fat that meat!  I told the server I could not eat this and she offered to bring more brisket.  The second plate was just more of the first.  My husband's brisket was lean.  When she brought the check we told her that my meal was terrible and inedible.  She said she was sorry but there was no offer to remove my meal from the bill or any gesture to compensate for this meal that was not eaten.  We suggested she tell the manager  and said we would probably not return her only response was \"Really\".  Not the way to get customers to return!"}
{"text":"The brisket blue cheese salad and the honeymustard chicken salad were recommended by the bartender/hostess and they were 2 of the best salads we have ever had, the brisket is fall apart tender and the chicken was great as well as the dressings being very delicious and on the side so you can choose how much dressing to use. I will stop here again for sure on the way to or from sedona. Located just off the freeway for an easy stop."}
{"text":"Been to TG several times. Never disappointed. Pulled pork, BLT, or Hamburger - Great food. Excellent service."}
{"text":"Service was pretty slow although they warn of this on their table brochures. I had brisket and ribs and was not impressed. Living in Memphis for a while, I may expect too much but I will continue searching elsewhere for good bbq in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the Tennessee Grill! It is our local \"go to\" spot. It's a great place to check out when in the mood for something other than a burger or Pizza, the atmosphere is good and they serve breakfast too. Their food is delicious, I love their spinach salad and BLT but their BBQ is amazing too.They have great daily specials and the staff is always so friendly! We recommend them all the time to friends and clients in the area and will continue to frequent their establishment as well. Just remember, \"Everything is better with bacon!\" and Tennessee's is awesome!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. The food and service was great.  I loved the brisket and the sauces. Restaurant was nice and clean."}
{"text":"Great place! Loved the BBQ sauces, 4 of us ordered. When the food came the chicken on one of our sandwiches was so small that the server said to the one with the chicken... Don't worry, we are preparing you another meal because that chicken didn't fit on the bun... Wow, a extra sandwich, and no charge... That was really nice.... Oh and the cook came out to give his apologies as well. 
All other meals were good with no complaints.
Great place, will be back!"}
{"text":"Oh my god this is one of the best barbecue places I've ever eaten at. I have a meat high right now. Get the barbecue combination platter you will not regret it."}
{"text":"When the Mrs asked me to get ribs tonight I found out our Q rib place was gone. I continued to Tennessee Grill and made a great discovery.  Our too go rack of ribs and two sides were, by far, the best we've had.  Nice little cafe and bar too."}
{"text":"We decided to check this place out on a recent trip. We were really pleased that it was great. The service was fast and the server awesome. We had the pulled pork and beef brisket and it was really tasty. There is a small bar next to the dining room and the restaurant was busy, but not super packed on a Saturday night. I'll definitely be back next time I'm in town. Recommended."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant three times now. Once for a burger and twice for wings. I got the Bob's Bitchin Burger which was a good solid Burger. But the real reason to come here is for the smoked wings. They are by far the best wings I have had in a very long time. They are amazing! Do yourself a favor and get them naked with the sauce on the side. That way you can taste the smokiness of the wings and how crispy they are. Whenever I want some good wings and am in the area I will definitely stop by here. The service is super friendly and you can tell that all the workers get along nicely and it is a friendly environment. I also am looking forward to trying their other BBQ Foods."}
{"text":"Overall food was good. No pickle with your sandwich for some reason. Wait staff are very nice and well trained. Prices are to high."}
{"text":"My first review we left before eating due to poor service. We decided to try this local place again as the aroma wafting from the location is always awesome. We went for a late breakfast yesterday. Service was MUCH better. Seated and served coffee right away. Great improvement from our first visit. Funny, though, I noticed a \"notice\" of sorts on every table regarding service - asking customers to be patient and comparing the wait time for your food to the average of other restaurants...wow...never saw that before and found it a tad odd if only because my first review was all about that.
So on to the food - I am very sorry to say it could have been better. My husband and I both ordered the breakfast burrito. I had mine filled with the shredded pork. The only thing I tasted was onion. I didn't see onion but I tasted only onion. Weird. I really expected to taste some moist pork loaded with a smoke flavor similar to the aroma I smell walking into the joint. There was really nothing, no smoke flavor, no other flavor except that lingering onion thing going on. Trying to achieve some kind of smoky flavor I did try the 4 BBQ sauces - the best being the bourbon one for my taste. I have to say I was disappointed because I really wanted to like this place but I should not have to use the sauce just to have some kind of BBQ flavor and I was really surprised at the lack of flavor in the meat. My husband agreed that his was the same. On the bright side the potatoes served were brown and crisp  - nice job on those. 
Sorry guys - wish this could have been more positive. Great improvement on the service though."}
{"text":"Happened upon this place headed home. Brought my family and everyone ordered something different: pulled pork, ribs, brisket, wings. Everything was delicious and the service was wonderful! Wish we lived closer!"}
{"text":"A couple years ago this place was awesome. Since then it seems to just get worse. Last five or six times I've been it was less than stellar. Food is okay and the staff is friendly but if you want to customize your order like ADD JALAPENOS good luck."}
{"text":"Took a couple guests for dinner here the other night. The food was delicious, the service was great, but the two of us who ate the briscuit chuck burgers ended up in the bathroom all night and the next day with stomach problems."}
{"text":"the onion rings were great . the food was average ."}
{"text":"Best ribs I've ever eaten, and very reluctantly shared 1/2 rack with my daughter.  My son had the BLT but it was loaded with thick bacon and absolutely delicious (he reluctantly gave me some of his haha).  My new habit!"}
{"text":"Our family of 4 loves Tennessee Grill. The kids always get the Mickey Mouse pancakes. I love the wraps and my husband loves everything. The staff is always very friendly."}
{"text":"Nice breakfast and BBQ place. Tables are a little tight together and rather loud inside. Food was good, nice variety of BBQ sauces."}
{"text":"We went here for Mother's Day..the food was excellent, we thoroughly enjoyed the Half off alcohol and appetizers all day on Sunday's..the staff was happy and helpful, we had a great time! 

The restaurant was kid friendly, there was plenty of room for everyone, and the whole menu looked great..can't wait for next time so we can try more of the excellent food!!"}
{"text":"Tennessee Grill is not only a restaurant that serves excellent food and delivers incredible service - they are a restaurant that supports our community, helping to make it great.
Owner Bob, and Curtis Roberts are key reasons why Tennessee Grill has secured a place in Anthem's heart as a restaurant that matters. They both actively seek opportunities to support local organizations and fundraisers, and not because it looks good, but because they genuinely care. 
Excellent food. Incredible staff -. And a place that our families all love to visit - Thank you Tennessee Grill for being everything we all want in a great restaurant, living a great community!"}
{"text":"Have been there several times for lunch and breakfast. The brisket and pulled pork sliders served with your choice of side were excellent; on Tuesday's they offer \"Taco Tuesday\" which is a great value where you choose your meat and it is served in a flour tortilla with a side of salsa and chips. For breakfast I had bacon and eggs and it was average. I probably will stick with lunch or dinner only."}
{"text":"I ordered the spinach artichoke dip and a beer. There was definitely not enough dip for all the chips. Small place. The dip was just ok, but the guineas made up for it. I won't come back"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today on a whim when we were driving by. We didn't try the BBQ so I can't comment on that. I just had a basic grilled chicken sandwich and fruit cup - everything was fresh and delicious. My mom loved her smoked turkey sandwich and said the onion rings were remarkable. The Mickey Mouse pancake was a hit with my littles. Decor is nice. Service was great and it was very clean. We enjoyed the kisses too"}
{"text":"All I can say, get the brisket platter... You can cut it with your fork! Falls apart, mouth watering good!"}
{"text":"We loved this place.  We came on a Thursday night.  Great food, big portions,  fast service.   Try the Tennessee Twister Fries.  They are unlike any fries I have ever had.  So tasty!  Thank you YELP for guiding us to this yummy place!"}
{"text":"Let me pre empt this review with... If you are in a hurry or are really hungry and need to eat \"NOW!\", this place will make you wait for your order. Total time there was 1.75 hours. With that said...

I've had Texas, KC, Carolina and Memphis BBQ (and a lot of their variants) before, and this place is defiantly more of the Memphis variety, which is a good thing if you are going to call your restaurant the state from which that flavor originates from.

Started with fried pickles. They came sliced like what you'd get on a burger, not spears. Came with a sort of Shiracha sauce that had very little kick. Not bad. I asked for some Ranch dressing. Much better.

For our mains, I ordered half baby back ribs with small brisket and my GF got the brisket sandwich. Rib meat was cooked perfectly and fell off the bone quite easily. The bark was the best part. The brisket meat was shredded both on my plate as well as in her sammich. Yum!

Our waitress was polite, very friendly and explained the four sauces (five if you count ketchup) that we could slather our meat with. None of which were to my liking, and quite frankly, the meat didn't need any additional flavor or moisture.

So, why only 2 stars? I took one off for the excess amount of time it took to get our meals.  This is a BBQ joint. All of the meat was prepared either that morning or the day before. I honestly thought that they started their \"low and slow\" once we placed our order. I took another star off for when the waitress cleared the table next to us, dropped 2 wing bones on the floor, kept stepping over them for the majority of the time we were there (which was long). The real kicker (literally!) was when she finally dealt with the two wings by kicking them back under the table! The third star was for the manager over charging our card and informing us that they have a new merchant system and that he would go back in and adjust the total (which he did do the next day). That is just one more thing for me to remember to check. Call it the \"hassle\" factor. He was nice about it, but it was the nail in the coffin for me.

All in all, we probably won't be returning. Food good, service bad."}
{"text":"Been to The Tennessee Grill a few times. Love supporting local and it's the place for BBQ in Anthem. The Grill is always adding fun new items and specials. I recently tried and loved the wings and pulled pork sliders. So good! Jen is the sweetest and saw her speaking with all customers. You can tell she really cares. I can't wait to try more items on the menu, especially breakfast!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. We had a big group and received great service, food was awesome."}
{"text":"I have been working for a company based in Anthem for 4 years. But this is my first time to Tennessee Grill. And it definitely will not be my last. I was just going to grab something quick as I viewed their menu online before stopping in. But after sitting down and reviewing the menu again I changed my mind on what I wanted to eat. And I'm glad I did. I chose to get the BBQ Sampler. And it did not disappoint. Pulled chicken and pork sliders, hot links, ribs, and brisket with a side of baked beans. The rib meat just came right off the bone. The brisket was tender. Hot links had wonderful flavor, and not to hot. And the sliders were great. I would also get the beans again. Most places make them too smokey or too much bbq. But these were perfect. And with chunks of bacon. 

It was unfortunate to see how empty this place was. Maybe it does better during lunch hours. Hopefully word will get out on how good this place is. I cant wait to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Not impressed with the chicken sandwich I got. Not well made at all with poor flavor. Friend enjoyed their meal so may be back to try something different. Service was quick, picked up an order to go."}
{"text":"When you read the name \"The Tennessee Grill\" and see that the grill features \"Bob's Bitchin' Burgers,\" you might be thinking that there might be some themed ambiance.  Perhaps there would be some regional (southern) music playing and the down-home decor to go with it.  But it's just a well-lit storefront - void of any expected namesake look and feel.

That said, the service is friendly and prompt.  The food comes in generous portions and tastes good.

I wouldn't go out of my way for a return visit, but if it's on the way (in this case, going through Anthem, AZ) I wouldn't avoid giving it another go.

The look and feel of a restaurant greatly increases a positive experience.  If they ramp up the extras a little, they'll give their yummy food more impact - with more repeat customers."}
{"text":"I was craving BBQ so I decided to try this place. I sit down tell the server I am going to order takeout. She gives me the menu and tells me that once I decide to go up to the counter to place my order.....after some serious thought I figured out what I wanted. I go to order and am told they have NONE of their BBQ items. I understand that happens but if you are a BBQ place shouldn't that be the first thing you tell the customer before they look over the menu!?"}
{"text":"We stopped in on our way ho.e from Prescott on a Sunday.  We ordered the BBQ sampler and wish we hadn't.  The meat was very dry and seemed like yesterdays or older. The food gave us heart burn and really should not have been served. A few hours later we got sick.  There was nothing fresh about it. We will definitely not visit it again. Keep moving on by this place and go somewhere else. I don't think they will be open in a year."}
{"text":"This is literally the ONLY place I ever crave breakfast from and they just failed for the third visit in a row. Ended up walking out. Maybe if they stop changing the menu every other week and replace/add to their staff I'll return. Uugh! I hate that the food is so good!!"}
{"text":"We had really good dinner! 

Service was great and food was awesome! 
We had Wednesday 49cent wing and it was worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Was traveling back to Los Ángeles and decided to get a good meal. I was highly disappointed.   My plate had a bed of oil in the bottom.  My meat was floating on this oil.  The interesting thing is that i forfeited the chicken and ribs meal when the server stated the chicken was fried.  She said that both the ribs and brisket was grilled.  Horrible meal.  I tried salvaging and eating some of the meat that wasn't saturated in fat but gave up i couldn't stomach looking at all the fat.  And the barbecue sauce was watered down.  I'm used to nice thick and hearty barbecue sauce.   Highly disappointed!

This is in response to the owners response to my review.  

First of all we are not complaining about the service.  Your waitress apologized several times to us and was very attentive.  We are complaining about the poor quality of food.  The reason you got a negative review is that you were there the whole time.  As a good business owner, you should have approached us to at least apologize instead of playing ghost in front of us.   That says a lot about your leadership and integrity. 

If you can, I would certainly love for you to post the camera footage for viewers to view the disgust on my face upon looking at my food.  They'd also see that I only ate the potatoes and coleslaw and a very small portion of my meat.  Yes the server came over a couple times and of course I mentioned to her that the food was saturated in fat.  She politely apologized as was the right thing to do.   And yes I asked for a box to take the leftovers for my dog.  And you know what? Half way down the road I threw it away as I had an upset stomach from your food.  I figured it wasn't even fit for my dog.  And yes I've written several reviews.  Just for your knowledge, That's what YELP is for!!   And believe me I never had any plans on revisiting your restaurant EVER again.  Instead of apologizing you point the finger and make up ridiculous stories    Just to let u know your ignorant response is read by millions of yelpers.  BTW I never asked for a free meal.  My friend did however mentioned to the server that the meal was not worth what we paid for it.  You got your payment and we both got upset stomachs."}
{"text":"Food is amazing ,staff is super friendly also. I would recommend dine in as take out seemed to be much smaller portions and a pretty long wait."}
{"text":"I ordered the Mediterranean salad and chicken wings. The 4 star review is ONLY for the salad. Loved the salad and the dressing! I opted for no meat on the salad since I got the wings as well. I have to say I was very disappointed in the wings. I ordered them with mild sauce. I had my order to go otherwise I may have returned the wings back to the kitchen. They appeared to have no sauce on them. They were also overcooked and not juicy at all. Disappointing as I came to this place because it was the closest place to me with wings. Maybe some of their other things are good, however, the wings are not!"}
{"text":"Really like this place. Service is always really friendly & food is always good. Love the burgers & BBQ."}
{"text":"Huge miss with lunch today.  Hoping from the other reviews that this was only an off day...but as a visitor can't afford to chance a return 

Cornbread - looks good. Even has bacon on top! But dry and lacking flavor 
Ribs/brisket combo- none of the meat seem to have any smoke flavor, the brisket was like strips of a bad roast cooked wrong ...the ribs also flavor less, the meat had a look and flavor that perhaps it was cooked a day or two prior to my visit.  
Coleslaw- not to my taste...had an odd flavor 
Beans tasted like canned beans but think they may have been homemade. Very adequate 
The little bun was delicious...like a Hawaiian roll grilled slightly. 

I like my BBQ in a style that doesn't require sauce..this needed sauce. Of the sauce choices, I enjoyed the bourbon sauce, however the raspberry sauce wasn't for me and the other two tasted like bottled sauce (hienz perhaps)

Another at the table had the pulled pork sandwich with fries and enjoyed it. 

That's my experience. Perhaps you'll get lucky like so many others seem to have."}
{"text":"Sooooo sad the the good service was not accompanied by good brisket....in a word: dry.  However, the wings were very good
and meaty."}
{"text":"Delicious burger but some of the best French fries anywhere..
Service is great too"}
{"text":"Were from California and while traveling from Phoenix to Sedona found this outstanding restaurant on Yelp. The staff was very friendly and the waitress Vilene was great and guided us to the best things on the menu. There was 6 of us and we all loved the food a lot and would go out of our way to come back. Outstanding brisket."}
{"text":"The owner of this place is amazing! I have seen her every time I have came into the establishment you can tell she is very on top making sure customers are happy and taken care of in every aspect. The food is just as amazing as the drinks and the service!"}
{"text":"Great food, prices and service! We stopped in anthem on our way to Flagstaff, and started to go to Dennys. I was luckily able to convince my family to go here instead, and we were very pleased. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"everything was amazing! Service was awesome! Order the sore saddle burger can't go wrong. All of the homemade barbecue sauces were excellent. Go for the razzberry BBQ sauce!"}
{"text":"Second time coming here to check out what they have to offer. And my verdict is I love this place. I love how they have a family area and a bar area so you can have both worlds depending what your mood is. The food is amazing!!  My favorite so far is the smoked chicken quesadilla!  This is going to become my local watering hole now I know it!!!  Great atmosphere in the bar area for sure!!"}
{"text":"I'm from Nashville Tennessee. I eat a lot of wings. The smoked wings at this place rock. If your looking food great smoked meat and your close. Come here!"}
{"text":"Solid Q. I'm a big BBQ guy from KC and they put out a solid product. I think brisket is the biggest test in smoking meat and they do good. Not big fan of the sausage but everything else is money. The zinger sauce is killer too."}
{"text":"We went there for the first time tonight and it was amazing! Very warm and friendly and Jennifer took awesome care of us. The food was delish and the beef brisket and wings were some of the best we have ever had. Family environment, very much a community feel. Loved it! We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots after tonite. Service was amazing and the food was to die for. Everything is made fresh to order. All the appetizers are so delicious especially the smoked wings .The brisket pork and chicken are off the chain. Everything is smoked daily and this place is so clean.. I highly recommend you try this place if your close by or not. Will definitely be back with the family next week.  No doubt a wonderful place to come eat amazing food people.  DZ;)"}
{"text":"It was a fluke my better half found this restaurant because it's somewhat hidden. 
Our lunch was a 10+ totally-- every bite totally delicious. Awesome. Between the two of us we ordered the brisket Pita and the sliders (chicken n brisket) with fries and onion rings. We have absolutely no complaints about our lunch we ordered other than we got full before we were able to finish.  
Vilean was our super server and PJ is the magician in the kitchen.  I cannot rave enough about the brisket enough and then too the barbecue sauces were excellent. 
After reading another's review of the Tennessee Grill, it was noted how delicious the cornbread is so we ordered a piece of cornbread topped with bacon and a slice of homemade German chocolate cake to go that we are both looking forward to devour. Thanks for the great and surprising eating experience ?Jeanne B"}
{"text":"What a wonderful change of pace. We had fast, friendly service. We had spinach and avocado dip. We had the special for Taco Tuesdays. We enjoyed beef and chicken tacos with slaw. They even have sweet tea. This was a nice treat today, all the boxes checked."}
{"text":"caring workers and great service... food is average.  bbq reminded me of leftovers reheated from fridge.  rest of food was fried pretty much.  I did like having choice of sauces.  clean but boring place.   not cozy."}
{"text":"Thought my fresh bagel was great and the friendly people were awesome! I think if had a problem with my food or service I would have mentioned my concern to them in person. Did you Tony? They seem very friendly."}
{"text":"our kids/grandkids went a few nights ago.  while they all agreed the food was good, they would NOT go backed b/c the waitress was just plain surly."}
{"text":"Great BBQ and sauce selection. The barbecue sampler is perfect for two adults and a child to share.  Happy Hour is the time to go if drinking though, $7 for a 20 oz draft is a little steep for the area"}
{"text":"On the way home from our Arizona trip we decided to grab something to eat before making a pit stop to the Nike store. I ordered the breakfast burrito with home fries. The burrito was really good but the home fries were a little too salty in my opinion. Burrito was abt $9. I also ordered an orange juice to complete my breakfast :') our waitress was really nice! I would have given this place 4 stars but when I walked out I smiled and said bye to a worker and she just glared at me. Maybe I had something in my teeth. Overall a nice little restaurant for breakfast.

{"text":"No Doubt THE BEST BBQ BRISKET in the Phoenix Metro area.  Believe me I've tried them all!  Juicy, tender, seasoned just right!  I'm just so lucky I don't have to drive to Scottsdale for the best BBQ Brisket.  It's right across from the Anthem's Outlets.  The service was excellent and they are showing FIFA's Women's World Cup!  What could be better?"}
{"text":"I came to this place for my very first time. I didn't know place was clapping at 20:00 so we got there around 19:50. I asked the guy about their closing time but he told me not to worry about it and to feel welcome. We ordered our food and both me and wife really enjoyed our food. Server (Olga) was really nice and professional. Food was fresh and my burger I had was juicy and same with my wife's fish. I'm definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times. There appears to have been some changes in last few months. The regular fries are below average- pay extra and get the Tennessee Twister fries. They're much better. Kids meal chicken fingers are very good.  My daughter liked them.  Make sure you state you want unsweet tea if you order ice tea- a mouthful of sweet tea when you're not expecting it is not pleasant. My sandwich had some issues, but 4 people came over to apologize- so props for being sorry for the mistake. Unfortunately, the waitress never stopped by. It was ok. Slower than it has been before. Not as good as it's been in the past."}
{"text":"Hidden on the menu is a bowl of soup. I had a decent sized bowl of beef barley and it was great. So was the patty melt and pile of thin pre-salted French fries. And of course an ice cold Corona (it's a bar, after all). The server was attentive, friendly, and efficient. 

In the Anthem sea of all franchise concept restaurants, this stands out. But there's a hitch. What bar-restaurant lets it's cook go home at 7 pm on a Saturday night? It just happened while I was writing this review. That might even violate a city or lease requirement that food will be served with the alcohol. Don't count on dinner unless you call ahead to see if the cook is in."}
{"text":"Stopped here on our way to Sedona.  Pancakes are thick,  fluffy,  amazing.  Glad we didn't go to dennys as planned.  Only reason didn't do 5-star, took a little long for the food to come out.  But great anyway."}
{"text":"We stumbled onto this place because we were driving back to Scottsdale after riding UTVs and what a find it was! The restaurant is low key with a full bar and a menu full of amazing BBQ choices. I had the BBQ sampler plate which included ribs, brisket, sausage, and pulled chicken sliders. The bbq was tender (fall off the bones) and flavorful. The zinger bbq sauce was amazing. The service was great and the food was equally great. The bartender recommended the Tennessee twisters which were perfectly seasoned potato twists (like French fries but so much better). Even though I'm not a fan of French fries, I ate every single one of those twisters. This was a wonderful find. Perfect way to end my vacation."}
{"text":"This is the best barbecue I have eaten in Arizona! Everything was amazing we ordered the brisket plate, and the full rack of ribs... We also had boneless wings :-) everything was tender, and the ribs fell off the bone. They have four different barbecue sauces and each one was just a soon as the last! I recommend the raspberry one on the pork ribs! Our waitress was great she was very attentive, and just a doll! When we are in town we will definitely stop here every time! The restaurant section was very clean and everything looked polished and new :-) then they had a espresso bar in the middle that was closed and to the right side they had a bar, like a sports bar. I will definitely try the pulled pork next time if I can even stay away from those pork ribs! They were seriously the most amazing smoky pork ribs I've ever eaten!"}
{"text":"Saturday night 8:00 p.m. we were looking for something different...ugh. Bad. Just Bad. Food was over priced, I ordered French onion soup and a side salad without onions. Easy peasy..salad came out with onions, sent It back, second salad came out..onions again. Soup tasted like It was straight out of a can, no bread or cheese on top. I asked the server why there was no bread or cheese, she said I don't know that's how it is. There were four adults, two kids..we each had issues, cold broccoli, over cooked chicken wraps, dry macaroni and cheese and a $77.00 Bill. I had to ask the server to remove the salad and the soup off the bill as I didn't eat either of them after the first bite. Will not go back. This explains why the restaurant was completely dead on a Saturday night.  If I could rate this a zero I would."}
{"text":"This is my second time here as an out of towner, great food and service! Curtis is awesome! Ask for him anytime you come in! Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Well, sadly, I was disappointed. I had high hopes based on magazine articles and reviews and pictures. Based on pictures, did management change?  Mac n cheese is boxed. Brisket tastes like pot roast. Pulled pork just meh. Fries are awesome and southwest egg rolls are good. Everything was way over cooked!. Might come back for breakfast but likely won't even bother."}
{"text":"Great service. Everyone was very friendly but not impressed with the food. My husband got a burger and I ordered chicken. Food was dry and portion was small for the price. They do make in house BBQ sauce was that was food but the food does not compliment."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. I had the tomato basil soup and the appetizer sampler. Everything was fresh and super tasty.  Our server Danny was friendly, attentive, and took great care of us. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Tn, sorry to say this place didn't live up to to the name.  Very pricy.  Had the platter and the meats were bland.   Not recommended"}
{"text":"Mmmm, this place is delicious, and the service was wonderful! We ordered the Bob's B*tchn Burger, I had the Tennessee Twister fries, my sister had the sweet potato fries, and while it took a bit longer than most places for the food to come out, we didn't mind because when it came you could tell how much work went into it. Gorgeous pretzel buns, beautiful fresh ground brisket and chuck. When we left, our waitress gave us refills to go, which was very nice of her. I only wish I lived closer so I could come here more often!"}
