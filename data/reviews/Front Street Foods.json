{"text":"Love the atmosphere! This place makes me so happy :) It's like a mini food festival filled with the best foods in Toronto, everyday, anytime. The only downside is everything is twice the price :(

My favorites: Hot Bunzz, lobster roll, Uncle Tetsu, Holy Chuck"}
{"text":"To start I was REALLY looking forward to Fresh Off the Boat being there this year and trying their lobster rolls and/or their lobster pouting. To my disappointment.. they did not make an appearance this year. 

Moving on to a review of the food though, we first tried the baos from Momofuku (which I didnt try but I hear weren't bad). They were $5 each which is pretty standard. 

We also had the paella which was also standard - but should've been better for the $14 price tag they carried - the seafood didn't taste that fresh, and there really wasn't that much seafood. 3 mussels, 1 piece of shrimp, and some pieces of calamari that tasted frozen.. the taste wasn't bad but for the $14 it was a very large bowl of spiced rice basically. one redeeming factor was the spicy salsa - which was bomb!! 

One last redeeming factor was chimney stax ----- it was a 60min wait.. but it was SOOOO good. Honestly really really good. I've also had the chimney stax from Eve's.. but honestly this was so much better. The chimney stax was perfectly crunchy, sweet and the ice cream was also delicious. So definitely give that a try. 

Overall, overpriced, some good food in a nice cute atmosphere."}
{"text":"It's a great concept that reminded me so much of San Francisco! My husband and I tried it on 2 different Saturdays and we both found things we liked. I wish there was a little more variety especially for dessert and drinks."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a friend.

Lots of seating, great atmosphere. 

Tried the hot bunzz, pretty good.  Sort of like a pizza pocket with more exotic fillings.  Keep in mind it gets a bit messy so be careful eating."}
{"text":"Pros:
-wide variety of stalls
-ample outdoor seating at 130, after the lunch rush but majority of the seats were not shaded
-good location for people travelling through Union and the people that work around there. Saw a lot of people with suitcases and cameras.

Cons:
-expensive for what you get. We had three little tacos ($12 for 3, or $4.50 individually), Mac & Cheese ($11) and frozen custard ($4 for one scoop) all from different vendors.  Portions were not large nor was the quality exceptional. 
-cash only. No credit or debit accepted

Would not go there again nor recommend it"}
{"text":"YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS

please please please please leave this here for ever and ever and ever. 

beer. YUMMY foods, outside tables. Honestly? what more do you need?!"}
{"text":"I LOVE that this little strip opened right in front of Union Station. Everyone seems to be enjoying themselves, basked in the sunlight and listening to live music enjoying some of Toronto's top food vendors, including Uncle Tetsu's Cheesecakes, Holy Chucks, Bacon Nation, and Jedd's Frozen Custards!

The one stand that caught my eye was the Lobster Corn Dog ($12) that comes with a side of coleslaw. I've seen numerous instagram posts about this so I had to try it. 

Just a note, the portion was incredibly small. I finished the lobster corn dog in probably two bites. Some may not think it's worth $12 because of the portion, but there was a decent sized lobster tail under all that batter, so definitely worth a try! 

I hope this place is here to stay! It's just so convenient that so many of my favourite vendors are grouped in one location. I'll be coming back here as long as the summer lasts!"}
{"text":"Hopefully they will make this an annual thing. It was nice to have this as an option for lunch. I'd like to see more vendors and more seating next year! The employees were fantastic - they always made sure the area was clean."}
{"text":"This market is no longer at Adelaide Place as I want to update my insights about this year's location and food. 

Front Street Foods is back but wait...it is not on Front Street anymore! It is located on the 2nd floor terrace of Adelaide Place, I found that this was more of a hidden food market compared to last year. They were only open on weekdays.

What I tried this year at this market: 
-Brock Sandwich
-Ice Cream Rolls
-Kaboom Chicken 

Brock Sandwich:
I tried the buttermilk chicken sandwich and it was by far the best thing I've tasted from this market. The chicken was freshly deep fried and the centre was moist. The hot sauce added a nice kick to it. It was delicious and I want to go to their restaurant one day on Bloor. 5/5 stars.

Ice Cream Rolls:
Guess this is another popular trend in Toronto at the moment. You can watch them make your ice cream in front of you and you had multiple flavours to select (strawberry, oreo, etc). It was just alright. 2.5/5 stars.

Kaboom Chicken:
A great mix of Korean culture and western culture at display here. Egg waffles with chicken is definitely a neat idea. The chicken sauce was pretty good but the egg waffles were more of a let down in my eyes since they weren't as soft and fluffy. 3.5/5 stars.

Also, I find that vendors do switch from time to time as I went back to get a sandwich from Brock Sandwich but learnt that they were not there anymore which was a bit disappointing. 

There was a great selection of food vendors but the location this year was not ideal as where they had it last year right in front of Union Station. You can either go up the stairs where they advertise the market thru a painted sign on the wall on University or pass it completely. Hopefully, they bring back the punch next year."}
{"text":"Dropped by this gem of a market when I missed my GO train at Union Station. Silver lining, I suppose! It's a great alternative to the usual eateries at Union, and gives us all an excuse to take it easy in one of the busiest places downtown.

As tempted as I was to get absolutely everything available at this market, I opted for the Snow Crab Fries from Fresh Off The Boat (two thumbs up) and the buns from HotBunzz Street Cuizine. Not gonna lie, I had to look up the name of this place from another article because all I could remember was the abundance of Z's in the name... Thankfully, the buns were way more memorable! Tastes better than it looks, trust. Go for the pulled pork.

A few other popular vendors that you might be excited to find are:
- Holy Chuck Burgers (limited selection compared to their original menu),
- Uncle Tetsu Cheesecake (so you can chuckle at everyone else still lining up at the Bay/Dundas location), 
- Jedd's Frozen Custard (because frozen treats in summer heat is perfection)

Great selection overall - from savoury options like latke poutines to sweet indulgences like ice cream sandwiches. Hope they move this market indoors somewhere during the winter, would love to have this available all year round!"}
{"text":"Came her around noon on a weekday for a gyro. 

Pros:
- Nice ambiance 
- Good service 
- Good portion 

Cons:
Pricey for a gyro ($7.90)"}
{"text":"You know Union station used to be the worst area for anyone traveling.  By that I mean on foot, by subway and even worse, in a car.  Well you can put all those things behind you (for now) because for the most part the area is all cleaned up and fully functional.  On top of this, they added some real street cred by dropping a food market right smack in front of front (get it!).  Front Street Foods, offers a vast selection of treats for travelers looking to grab some food in a pinch or locals just looking to try something different.  Before I sound like a travel brochure, just know that most of the options prior were either McDonald's, or Mmmm Muffins.  Not gunna hate, but sometimes a guy needs to treat himself knowmsayin?

Anyway, I got it started with a Fried Oyster Bao from Yolo.  Yes, YOLO the acronym designed and made famous by our very own Drake.  You know, Drake, the type of guy who cries when cutting carrots so that the onions won't feel alone.  Yeah that's the one!  This place has nothing to do with him besides the horrible name of the food stand, but yeah that Fried Oyster was aight.  

Next up was Uncle Tetsu for dessert.  Now this is where things get even better.  Not only was there NO LINE UP for the cheesecake, we were also able to purchase the new Matcha Green Tea for the first time.  I was great, really it was, but that's not the end of it.  Uncle Tetsu, was actually there in the flesh, dancing with fans and openly taking selfies with people.  What a great guy, I wish we all had an Uncle Tetsu in our family.

Check out this joint, before the summer is over and it turns into a mound of snow obstructing your walk in December, YOLO.  Toronto needs more of this and less of Drake.  You know, the type of guy whose eyes roll back in his head when he eats chocolate."}
{"text":"August 02, 2015

I heard from Yelp that there is a thing called Front Street Food going on at Union Station Plaza.  We decided to check it out today.   There were at least 15 vendors. Most of them are very well known such as Little Fin, Fresh Off the Boat, Holy Chuck Burger, Uncle Tetsu, etc.  My husband decided to get a burger at Holy Chuck Burger... Yes! Smell so good! And there was a line up!  Though there weren't many people in the line but it was the longest line at the time.   He ordered a croissant dog that came with beef hot dog, cheese, bacon, mayo, fried egg and chips. The fried egg on the croissant was the best part of it.  Crispy and yummy!

We waited for a long time though it didn't need to take that long for one order. However, there was a rude guy who ordered after my husband and few people, he grabbed my husband's order and kinda ran away!  The staff apologized for the rudeness of that customer and asked my husband to wait for another order.  Yes we did wait but it was worth waiting for it.  

I also have heard about how popular the Uncle Tetsu Cheeses cake is.  People say that there are always lines up at the store.  How lucky we were!  I got a slice of cheesecake only few seconds ;)  Not many people know that there is Uncle Tetsu here.  No worries, I try my best to spread the word so people who love Japanese cheesecake don't need to spend their time in a long line.  They also sell you a slice of cheesecake if you want only to taste a small piece.  As I know, the festival will end on September 27.  Im not sure if they will extend the time.  Run! before they're gone!"}
{"text":"Two Questions:

How fun is this place?

AND

Why haven't we had something like this in Toronto before?

We got there about 11 am on a Saturday and it was pretty chill. I don't like crowds so this was perfect for me. Also perfect for me was being able to grab a glass of wine and wander the stalls. I beelined to Cava Sud because I love the restaurant itself and the stall did not disappoint. Fresh paella was perfect!
I tried the Uncle Tetsu cheesecake and honestly, I don't understand what the hype is. Maybe I'm just too much of a white girl, but I like my cheesecake to be dense and creamy, not like a fluffy egg pie. Yuck! Why would anyone stand in line for an hour for this stuff?

Overall, though, anyone would be able to find something they like and take a little break out of the day, do some people watching and have a cold beer or glass of wine.

The concept is exactly what Toronto has been needing for a long time!! It would be great to see this continue into the late fall with some heaters and such."}
{"text":"Love festivals/markets like these. The raclette suisse was delicious! If there is sausage, order it with your potatoes :)"}
{"text":"Woah! Coolest food in Toronto here in one spot (most likely? Lol). Came down to Front St. on my way to a concert, and decided to stop by for some food beforehand. 

With a couple tents and stalls set up in a fenced off area, there were different food and drink options, including alcohol too! Not always the best place for indecisive people, like myself, but ended up getting some cool food!

Picked out the Canadian Puller Bison Bun from Bunzz and some Nachos and Sauce from Mad Mexican. The buns were amazing, as there was bison inside and toppings too. Reminded me of a Chinese pork bun, but a twist on that flavour. The nachos were amazing too. With 5 different sauces to pick from, you could load up with as much of it as you wanted!

Overall, awesome options that you don't get to see everywhere, but a little on the pricey side. With the nachos at $4 and two buns at $15, not the cheapest alternative when you aren't really full after that. Definitely worth checking out though!"}
{"text":"Great initiative for the second year in a row. 

Today's choice went to Gushi (yes, Japanese street food). 

At the present time Gushi can only be found on the south east side of Dundas and Bathurst but the manager here at the front street street food market told me that they will soon opening on Queen and University starting the end of September. 

So today I got the classic Gushi (chicken) and the Japanese soda. 

Once again Gushi didn't disappointed my expectations. Still 5/5

See you soon on Queen and University"}
{"text":"Oh wow, I was in town for a conference last week, and how perfect was it that this was going on just next door?!  I made a couple of stops during my stay, and loved both the amazing food and the fun, friendly atmosphere!   I had the Greek corn from the Mighty Cobb, which featured some wonderfully sweet and fresh corn (yes, and being from Indiana I know what I speak of...) along with some absolutely delicious chicken tikka masala buns topped with bacon from Hot Bunzz for dinner one evening; oh, those were good.  I then had to try the much talked about crab topped Frisco fries from Fresh off the Boat.   Those were so tasty; they did not skimp on the crab, and the garlic aioli was rich and wonderful.  This was definitely one of those experiences where I felt pretty full about halfway through, but kept eating anyway because they were so good...this would definitely be a good share-able item!   As if I weren't stuffing myself enough, I had to try a piece of Uncle Tetsu's cheesecake.  In my opinion, it definitely lives up to its reputation; light, fluffy and wonderful!   I hope they do make this an annual event in the summer in Toronto.  It seems like it is well-liked by both locals and visitors!"}
{"text":"I think this is a fantastic way on bringing the community together! I love the variety of food stalls. It makes it easier to try different restaurants that aren't reachable during lunch time from the financial district. My two favorite stalls are FOTB and Hula Girl Espresso.

So sad that it's the last week :("}
{"text":"Only because I left a mediocre review, J Red. & Co. (https://www.yelp.ca/biz/j-red-and-co-brampton-2) removed my review of their food on their page.  

Here's the original review so that yelpers know about my opinion on their food.  (it's a 1 star now for removing a legitimate review)


------
Meh, I saw bunch of social media about this place for the front street food and got the raclette suisse. It was unfortunately nothing to rave about...

Food: 2/5, the salad was alright but the cheese was nothing more than regular raclette on breakfast potatoes. The flavour was bland and it looked better than it tasted.

Service: 3/5, the chef was there and a very pleasant lady.

Ambience: N/A, as it was an outside park area

Price: 1/5, this is where it really fails. $20 for that and a drink was totally not worth it. I get it is relatively unique but phew, not sure about that price tag for street food."}
{"text":"If you're in Toronto this summer you have to make it a point to drop in. Great way to try some new food and enjoy the city all at the same time. This should be a year round thing in my opinion - host outside in the summer and move inside in the winter. Best food options around by far. 

I have still not successfully gotten any Uncle Tetsu. They sell out early! Be warned... I consoled myself with a green tea Madeline. 

We did try Fresh Off the Boat - lobster roll to die for. Totally worth it to combine the specials and get it with the snow crab fries.  Yolo had Fried Oyster Po Bao - delish! We also got some cornbread from another stand - not really worth it for the price. 

Know that it will be BUSY and hard to get a table before Jays games."}
{"text":"I love this place! A huge seating area, amazing food selection and decent pricing. In comparison to other food fest (e.g. Mac and cheese, TO Food Fest.), I definitely prefer this the most. 

I had a churro icecream and a snow crab poutine. Both $10 each but huge portions, unlike the ones you get from those overrated food fest. Definitely would recommend everyone to come!!"}
{"text":"Finally, Toronto gets a street food market!  I agree with previous reviewers - this should be an annual event. 

First off everything looked delicious. I had the French fries with snow crab and garlic aioli from Fresh Off The Boat. It looked great and tasted even better with just the right amount of aioli - not drowning in it. Snow crab portion was generous lasting right to the last french fry. 

For desert, rather than the frozen custard every one raves about, I opted for the lighter nitrogen frozen sorbet from Eative. Compared to gelato it tasted wonderfully smooth. Perhaps nitrogen freezing creates smaller, even sized ice crystals vs the traditional freeze and shave method?

Some have complained about lack of seating but, hey, this IS street food after all. All in all a great addition to the city and well worth a visit for tourists AND locals."}
{"text":"Went for the Raging Bull at Holy Chuck Burgers. Recommendo! Gave hi fives to FM 88.9 for free sunglasses but broke them the next day."}
{"text":"It is an excellent idea.  A neat and organized event indeed for the Summer.  Pam Am does bring us all of this enjoyment on this finally construction-free Front Street in front of the gorgeous Union Station.

There are variety of food, drinks and desserts to choose from.  I admit that it will not be cheap  especially if we wanna try several items at one time.  Some popular food booths have longer lineup during busy lunch hours too.  However, I enjoy the atmosphere especially on the warm and sunny days.  There are plenty of tables and seats allowing an enjoyable patio eat-in while listening to the live music.  Just love it!"}
{"text":"With no food options inside Union Station any more, and not a lot of quick places to eat nearby, Front Street Foods is a fantastic idea for the summer.  The location is great with the large outdoor space full of a variety of vendors and tables for people to enjoy the weather.  

I went to Yolo and had a Hawaiian grilled cheese.  It was really tasty, though it tasted like they were using canned pineapple (would have been better fresh).

I also got some hydration juice.  It was delicious and refreshing, which I really needed on that hot summer day.  A bit more money than I would usually pay for a small juice, but it hit the spot when I needed it.

I took this opportunity to try Uncle Tetsu since there was no line up.  My mom makes a mean cheesecake so I had high expectations.  This was nothing like a typically cheesecake I've had before.  It was very light, fluffy and really tasty.  I can see why people love them so much!"}
{"text":"While trying to find a place to eat before catching the subway, this food fair full of tents of different restaurants and tables were conveniently set up during dinner before sundown.  There were 10 food vendors to choose from for dinner and dessert. Although some are a little pricey at $10 - 20 an item or plate, it was a nice treat to be able to eat right before catching the subway before dark."}
{"text":"After hearing so much about the burgers at Holy Chuck, I made a bee line to the long and winding queue today. I had the Holy Chuck burger which is essentially a double cheeseburger paired with bacon and caramelized onions. It's got the most satisfying bite of any burger I've ever had, something about the blend of all the salty, greasy and meaty elements really hits the spot.

Fresh Off The Boat is a seafood vendor I visited earleir this week. I opted for the combo with a lobster roll, snow crab fries and a coleslaw side. I did enjoy everything but couldn't shake off the feeling that it was very over-priced. Oh well, typical street vendor prices.

Lastly, I had a bite of the much-talked-about japanese cheesecake from Uncle Tetsu. In stark contrast to the cheesecake most have come to know and love, these are light in density and taste, with an almost mousse-like texture. The \"cheese\" taste is also quite subdued in comparison. I did enjoy it and will likely purchase more in the future. However, I can tell you that I will not be waiting in any lines for these cakes."}
{"text":"I came on a hot Saturday afternoon and boy was it crowded. There were vendors of all sorts here and though I was pleased with all I say, it was a smaller venue than I had imagined in my mind. Despite that, it is totally worth checking it out. I tried Uncle Tetsu stand here as I am not going to line up 1+ hours at their real store location. They have 1/8 or 1/4 sizing at $2 or $4 if my memory serves me correctly. You can buy 2 1/4 and they will put it in a nice box. 

The other vendors all looked good and the atmosphere was laid back and chill. A number of seats are available to sit down at on the sides. I say check it out if you havent been before but expect it to be somewhat smaller than what you imagine. Cheers. 4 **** stars."}
{"text":"It's unfortunate that they are only here for a short period of time, because I work near Union station and it was my go-to lunch spot. It has a great selection of quality vendors and the food was pretty healthy and tasted great. It even had an Uncle Tetsu tent that didn't require you to lineup at all!!!

They had live band playing at lunch, which is nice and makes a great atmosphere. I do wish they had more seating area though. It was packed at lunch and many times I had to take the food back to my desk :("}
{"text":"Really bad experience about the food crawl passport promotion, the passport costs 5 dollars and you can have 8 dollars dishes in most of the vendors; we ordered the poke bowl from Fishd by EDO. The portion is WAY TOO SMALL!!! It's like they using the fountain drink lid size! Are you kidding me??? It really disappointed!! NEVER TRY TO GET THE PASSPORT PLEASE!!! IT IS A TRAP!!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed this food fest very much. First off, it's not overly crowded, there were many clean tables to enjoy your food at, and when we were there around 6:30pm (Friday) there were two guys singing all the latest covers (sang wonderfully too ). 

After it was blasted all over Instagram, I had to check out Raclette Suisse and their melting cheese. It... Was.... Worth it. I love the blending of veggies (kale, baby pickles, beets), potato and with an added side of sausage ($18.01). It's pricey but worth it. The lady who served us was extremely friendly and very generous with our melted cheese portion ;)

I'll definitely come back to try the other vendors after such a pleasant first time."}
{"text":"With the Union Station exterior revitalization finally complete, it's time to celebrate with a brand new plaza facing Front Street. Why better than to open a pop-up food vendor place that showcases local eateries in the city?

Front Street Foods is that new hype engulfing downtown, and is honestly a much needed addition to what's otherwise an area where you're either eating McDonald's or eating food that's $$$$. It definitely has the San Francisco feel if you've ever been to Fisherman's Wharf or the ferry building, and I'm glad this awesomeness has arrived north of the border.

For my visit yesterday, I went to Fresh Off The Boat and tried the frisco fries. The cost was $10 and they didn't charge tax, which was quite neat. The fries were quite decent for a place that will be a tourist attraction, and the snow crabs were also quite delicious to eat. They had ketchup available on the side, but I opted to not take any since I figure it would ruin the taste.

The seating patio was quite nice and the umbrellas provide good shade from the afternoon sun, however you would hear occasional loud rumbling below from the trains that go by every 2-3 minutes. When I was having lunch, there was an indie radio station playing indie music, which was quite nice and relaxing.

Overall, Front Street Foods is a welcoming addition to the new Union Station Plaza, and a great place to relax and enjoy a summer lunch."}
{"text":"We came to check this place out just when they were opening up on a Saturday morning at 11am. I think it's the best time to go so you can snag a table with good shade and take turns buying an assortment of food/drinks. I love that they have great selection of food and quality is really good. I haven't tried all the stalls but I can say they are all good bets. 
People around us were talking about Uncle Tetsu stall of course - there is still a lineup but the wait is shorter. Cake is sold per slice though but if it's just to feed your curiosity more than your cravings, it is really a good deal.
Fresh Off the Boat offers lobster roll and fries with crab meat on top combo for 20bux. The lobster roll was okey - I liked the fries better.
Cold Brew was surprisingly good even just plain iced. It wasn't \"bitter\" at all and was very refreshing. Small is 4 bux and large is 5bux.
Eative was selling Gelato/Sorbet and was also giving samples to try. As soon as I tried their mango and peaches flavour frozen treat, I was hooked. The tropical flavours really stand out and it was just so refreshingly good! It was 3.99 I believe.
By the time 12noon hit, it got hot and busy! People might not find seating but most of what they sell you can eat standing or with just a tall table.
Most of them only take cash (did not really see machines to take credit/debit). 
If it rains, it's not covered but Union station is right there to take shelter in.
Overall it's a great place to check out and they're only there until the end of August. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far this summer.
There are a few things I like about this place:
-Many choices of vendors to buy food from during the lunch hour and several are well known like Gushi, Momofuku Noodle Bar, Eva's Original Chimneys etc.
-Easily accessible since it's right by Union Station
-Live music that's actually really good
-Alcohol is sold here
-Decent portion sizes at some food stalls

Cons:
-Some places overcharge for their food like $16 for duck confit pierogies which were literally 8 small pierogies with a very salty small duck leg on top at the Loaded Pierogi stall
-Narrow space between the back food stalls and some sitting areas, which is a lot more noticeable when it's crowded during the lunch hour
- I have yet to be blown away by any of the food at these food stalls. So far, I've tried the beef brisket sammie at the Carbon Bar, duck confit pierogies at Loaded Pierogi, double down beef bacon patties sammie at Patois, Eva's Original Chimney Cones (the one with the brownie chunks and toffee bits) - all were just okay...but Death by Venice's lemon ricotta rosemary gelato was surprising really good!

My friends' lobster roll and snow crab fries apparently tasted good though according to them. I'm allergic so I didn't try that from Fresh Off the Boat.

This summer market is worth going to once though (it's summer after all!) if you don't work or hang out in the area."}
{"text":"This is a decent spot to grab lunch, however, keep in mind that lunch time line-ups are a given.   

There are a good variety of vendors and it's located just outside of Union Station (VIA)

Yes- some items are more expensive than usual (I'm looking at you, Uncle Tetsu) but keep in mind you're paying for the convenience and location.

Bring cash!"}
{"text":"This place is fun and gives off nothing but good vibes in this beautiful summer weather.

I came here on a Friday for lunch as it is a few steps from the office...bought haddock & chips from Little Fin as it had one of the shorter lines and I really did not want to spend majority of my lunch hour waiting in line.

The seating is quite limited and I ended up walking over to the stairs outside by Royal Bank Plaza to enjoy my food.

Overall, this place is great if it were bigger...live music, great food, location and company!"}
{"text":"What a great idea! Great music and amazing food in the heart of downtown! I love the vibe here. I thoroughly enjoyed the snow crab fries from Fresh Off The Boat and corn on the cob from The Mighty Cob.

For those who haven't had the chance to try Uncle Tetsu, but want to, come here. There's absolutely no lineup. Well, maybe 5 minutes, but that beats standing in line for 45 mins - 1 hour.

Hopefully, this comes back next year.

When: Extended until September 27th
Parking: Street or at Green P lots
Hours: Monday - Friday: 7am - 9pm
Saturday: 11am - 9pm
Sunday: 11am - 6:30pm"}
{"text":"5/5 for the event! However ratings for food varies. 

Union Station looks way much better now after all the construction. The venue is spacious enough for all the foot traffic, and there is plenty of tables for people to relax and enjoy their food. I also found most of the shops to be super efficient and lines up were short for most of the time. Of course the price is generally more expensive than what you would get in their own restaurants, but at least you are getting something different than your usual food court stuff if you work in Financial District. 

*Fresh off the boat: Snow Crab fries + Lobster Roll combo - $20
The lobster roll here isn't as fresh as the ones in their brick-and-mortar store. I felt the mayonnaise was overpowering the natural lobster flavor and considering the amount of lobster that you are getting here, I found it to be a bit too expensive for $15. I'm not really a coleslaw person, yet I enjoyed this as it wasn't overly drenched in dressings and had a great crunch to it :).

There was an equal ratio of fries to snow crab, however I found the snow crab pieces were dry and the texture was like eating pork floss (if you are Asian you know this lol). The aioli was almost none existent and the snow crab was flavorless so I ended up dipping my fries with ketchup instead. 

*Hotbunzz street cuizine: Street Bunzz Combo - 3 for $10
The bread was really smooth and soft without being too doughy or heavy. For some reason I thought these only had toppings with no fillings, however these with filled to the brim and I liked how the bun was so light, it was the perfect vehicle to carry all the yummy goodness inside!

My fav were the Seoul City Beef Short Rib and Buddha's Bacon Butter Chicken. Both were packed with flavors and meat melted in your mouth. My least fav was Roasted Beet & Quinoa w/ Walnut Pesto as I found it to be overly sweetened and the beet was a bit sour too, a very unpleasant combination of flavors.

*Little Fin: Haddock + Chips - $11
The fish portion was tiny and a bit burnt on the outside, but surprisingly the fish was moist and really flavorful. Though it was a tad too salty for me, the fresh slaw helps to cut it down and the potato wedges were delicious with some garlic seasoning in them

*Mad Mexican: 3 tacos for $12
My most favorite taco was the braised pork as it was juicy and seasoned just right. Their guacamole is to die for, very creamy yet had the right amount of lime to cut down that fatty flavor from the avocado, definitely top your taco with some of that!! However I felt the taco shells were a bit too warm and it kept falling apart :(.

I didn't enjoy the fajita vegetable as I found it a bit sweet from the bell peppers and too bland. The yucantecan had chicken in it and it was so dry and tough to chew on. The chicken was tasteless as well, really disappointed :"}
{"text":"Such a great place to go for drinks and early dinner after work! Location is of course, awesome and love the cute chairs/table set up. Food is underwhelming but give the overall dining experience two thumbs up"}
{"text":"So on my way back of the trip I got out of Union and tried to get 1 eighth of a cake from Uncle Tetsu, they have that on their menu. The girl, initially said they had cheese cake, after hearing I'm only getting one eighth, changed her mind and said they don't have one eighth of a cake, only a whole cake. For her and this business, I would give a 0, and a whatever, as this is almost an insult. I also saw other customers with a small portion of cake standing there. Was it me? I don't know, but I was very polite when I ordered. But really I will leave their precious cake alone."}
{"text":"Be aware of time.... after the meal you are about to have and the shows you are about to watch, you might be forgetting that lunch is only for an hour! The food here is quite good, but pretty expensive. The places that I have tried there were Gushi, Burger Priest, Patois and an ice cream place. 

Gushi (3 stars) - not bad but not great as well... I remember just eating mouthfuls of mayonnaise and thick battered chicken/squid. On the days you want to feel fat and disgusting, this might be the right place for you!

Burger Priest (2 stars) - nothing special here - just the basic single or double patty cheeseburgers

Patois (4 stars) - this is the reason why I gave Front Street Foods 4 stars. Patois's Jerk Chicken Shawarma is life changing.The chicken is so moist and so flavorful! When a piece of chicken fell on the floor... I wanted to cry and I spiraled down a black hole of depression.

I forgot what the ice cream place was called but their lemon flavored ice cream is a great way to end a meal on a sweet note! :) 

Patois is the only place I would recommend if you do check out Front Street Foods!"}

{"text":"I love the assortment of goods here. I got the lobster roll and fries and I was super impressed. The meat was very tender. I love that the kombucha place is here - my husband lives for the floats. Sadly, Jedd's frozen custard was nowhere near as delicious as I expected. I was hoping for eggy, sweet, creamy. I got bland and flat instead. Shake Shack has frozen custard down and Jedd's should maybe re-think their's. 

There is some mark-up here compared to the brick and mortar stores. Uncle Tetsu's is like 40% more $. Ouch!

There is lots of seating, the area is accessible for everyone. It looks like a great place to enjoy something to eat and relax.

Can't wait to come back for a growler of kombucha!"}
{"text":"I love the idea of Front Street Foods and hope that it will be an annual tradition.

We came for lunch on a Tuesday afternoon and were able to snag a corner of a picnic table for 2.  I decided to get the lobster roll and fries from Fresh off the Boat and with a drink came to a very pricey $18.  I don't recommend it though - the lobster was extremely vinegar-y and tasted off.  My DC ordered a few tacos and a fresh lemonade from Mad Mexican.

There was live music happening while we ate.  A few umbrellas provided shade from the hot sun and the vibe was overall friendly with diners comparing their lunches.

We treated ourselves to a piece of cheesecake from Uncle Tetsu (no lineups!) and headed back to the office satisfied with our lunch in the sun."}
{"text":"Went to the street food market to grab something on the way to a Jays game. I liked the variety but I guess I chose the wrong vendor. I selected YOLO TO for a grilled cheese sandwich, something that is pretty hard to screw up. I was wrong. The advertised sandwich was mozza, grilled pineapple, smoked ham w/banana ketchup on the side for $9. Seemed a bit over priced but sounded good for a sandwich. 

I got the sandwich, thanked the vendor and walked away before opening it. Big mistake. I took one look at it and could not believe they were selling this crap. I looked inside the 'wich and saw terrible cheese coverage, CANNED PINEAPPLE (NOT GRILLED), deli ham and a single drop of ketchup, so little that you couldn't even get to it at the bottom of the plastic container. If I hadn't already been late for the baseball game I would've demanded my money back. Besides that my other regret was not taking a picture of it to show everyone on here how awful it was. 

I just hope the other vendors aren't such a rip off. I want tourists to enjoy themselves while in the city not get ripped off and left hungry. This purveyor should be booted from the market."}
{"text":"Nothing signals the end of summer more blatantly than no longer being able to sit outside, chill and listen to music - the hallmark of Front Street Foods. (Well, that and the end of $1 drinks at McDs) 

Front Street Foods extended their end date to Sept 27 but it's STILL much too short! The market showcased some of Toronto's best up-and-coming foods, like Uncle Tetsu's cheesecakes, Fresh off the Boat snow crab fries and Pancho's churros. Delicious choices for foods and drinks, and they constantly had some sort of musical entertainment going on. The stalls themselves did not have the \"temporary\" kind of look that CNE had, but had a quirky style to them, like weathered log huts. There was ample seating available, and so many beautiful days could be spent just sitting there, people watching and chatting with chums.

I'll miss this venue when they're done for 2015 but I hope they'll be back!"}
{"text":"Yay! If you have some time to kill, and would like to walk around and eat something - you can make a quick stop and explore some of the eats here. This street food festival will be open from july6th to Aug 30th.  Right in front of Union Station, fenced in for the crowds. Colourful red and lime green chairs and tables line and surround one of the perimeters - a wide array of places to eat surround the rest of the rectangle. 

There is variety of places to choose from, from burgers [Holy Chuck] to corn on the cob.[the Mighty Cob]. They even have a Kombucha [Pekoe] and even sorbet stand [EATIVE] as well !!

I discovered that they have uncle tetsus cheesecakes and if you are from toronto and know about this spot, you would normally have to wait in line for hours. HOURS. to taste their puffy air like cheesecakes. Not here. It took me 5 mins! Yay! 

I am returning to Ottawa at 330. In the meantime I am just people watching and waiting for it to be my time to jump back on the train home. However, before I do so, I'm gonna get a burger from Holy Chuck for the ride back."}
{"text":"Finally something interesting happening down at Front Street! 

I love the set up! The Popup vendors! Just the whole idea and concept and it is well executed! Here you can get a snack, a drink, a full meals from some of Toronto's most popular business/restaurants and some of them don't even have a store front!

Price might be a little more than getting from the original store but you can get everything here! Tacos from Mad Mexician, Burger from Holy Chuck and especially the over hyped Uncle Tetsu Cheesecake  was served as individual portion and no line up when I arrived around 10:30 am. 

There is also a nice seating area with entertainment. 

This is better than any food trucks or any of the gimmicky events I been to that required an admission fee and it will be here till end of September!

Too bad Toronto's summer is so short! Enjoy the experience while you can and hopefully this would be a constant yearly event from now on!"}
{"text":"I love the idea of a food paradise in the middle of downtown. 

The strip consists of endless vendor selection include Uncle Tetsu, Jedd's Frozen Custards, Fresh off the Boat, Bacon Nation, Pekoe, ect. 

Summer sun, delicious food, live music, quintessential picnic tables - Front Street Food is shaping up to be a top spot for a summer social."}
{"text":"This is a great concept and provides a wonderful taste to the flavours of the city. I always see many people lining up and lunch or for dinner. Great thing is that the shops are open late until 8pm.

La fiesta - their paella is great as it has a good amount of seafood. The pulled pork dish has pulled pork over rice with salad and a potato omelette. The pork was very juicy with the fatter bits being really succulent. The omelette was very soft and had an interesting texture. Overall great food stand. The actual company is a catering service with no storefront so I will definitely look for them at future events. 

Holy chuck - they're burgers are pretty filling and awesome. I had one of their classic burgers, while it looked small - it was very filling. Quite greasy but the unique flavour of the beef patty made it a great meal."}
{"text":"Convenient location right outside of Union Station. Great place to try a variety of food and skip the 2 hour line for an Uncle Tetsu cheesecake.

Hot Bunzz was delicious but that price for buns wasn't really worth it. Come and Get It was disappointing. Got a free sample of the jerk mango chicken, it was spicy but lacked the jerk and mango taste. Got the maple pork sandwich, the bread was too hard and the pork lacked seasoning. The kale coleslaw was bland and needed more acidity. Loaded Pierogi is a must try, generous portion and flavourful toppers for the pierogi which came out piping hot.

Overall, a great place to check out and to grab some food. Every stand had very nice staff that explained their food and most stands had a display of what they were offering."}
{"text":"Really cute patio seating right out front the beautiful Union Station.   Early morning, a few options are available including Wanna Banana, a delicious vegan and gf smoothie place.   The menu is simple with some add-ons such as mango chia, honey almond, coffee etc.   I had a raspberry banana smoothie and it was delightful.  It had no added sugar and tasted fresh.  Great way to start the morning, and the woman working there was friendly and conversational."}
