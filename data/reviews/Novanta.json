{"text":"My husband and I love this place. Not only is the pizza delicious, the pasta bolognese is perfection. The mozzarella bar is something we order every time we frequent too. We haven't gone wrong with anything we've ordered yet. The staff is smiley and helpful. Since moving out of the neighborhood, we still make it here at least once a month."}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE Novanta!  Their food is incredibly fresh, high quality and so so tasty.  I have loved every wood-fired pizza of theirs I've tried, but the Margherita with Prosciutto added on is my fave.  I tried their Mozzarella Bar Option 2 today and it was delicious - very light and fresh, and I have plenty of fresh mozz with pesto for an afternoon snack later.  Their cannoli are also quite good if you get them earlier in the day and eat them right away (goes to show how fresh & natural their food is).  In addition to excellent food, their service is phenomenal.  Nick and Nicole are always working extra hard to make sure their customers feel welcome and cared for.  The only downside is the pizza doesn't travel super well.  The fresh-made thin crust can get soggy if not eaten shortly after coming out of the oven.  Their location on Junction Road is cozy and very clean, with great outdoor seating surrounded by a fresh herb garden in the summer.  It's well worth it to grab a seat & eat on-site."}
{"text":"I called the girl there to ask for directions after I got off plane. Food was delicious service was good."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza! You can taste high quality fresh ingredients on every bite. Reasonably price, food prep station looks clean and organized. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"One of the best pizzas I have ever eaten in my life. The atmosphere was so quaint and fun that it made our time there even more special. We went right around 11am and there's wasn't a huge crowd and our pizza and panini came out very quickly.   The pizza itself was so delish! Soft AND crispy crust, the toppings melted together beautifully and the sauce was finger lickin good!   If you're in the Middleton area GO TO THIS RESTAURANT!"}
{"text":"Tried Novanta for the first time today and was not let down. Fantastic food and fantastic people working here! We had buffalo mozzarella with cherry tomatoes, balsamic, olive oil, and basil pesto for a starter. Greens and tomatoes were fresh and flavorful. I would have been satisfied with just that but we had to try their pizza of course! We ordered the salsiccia and it was amazing! Great sauce, just the right amount of cheese and toppings. Crust was perfect!   Novanta isn't fancy or pretentious which is fine by me. It is small, narrow, and there isn't anything noteworthy for decorations. I'm there to eat and I can't stand uptight places that aren't welcoming. The staff is amazing. So friendly and helpful. A little boy next to us spilled his soda and the workers made a bee line to help clean it up, and him up. The boy said \"I'm only 4\" as his excuse for the accident. So adorable.  Pizza Brutta was our go-to spot before this but Novanta has them beat on price. Can't wait to come back here! Dessert is next!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Madison! I know that's bold, especially coming from a Ian's and Glass Nickle lover, but the simplicity, flavor, and freshness makes this the best pizza in madison. I make a special trip from Lodi for this pizza.  The staff are all awesome too, especially the lady who's the main waitress who works like 7 days a week there, she's awesome!  Get the pesto, add sausage, to die for! Don't forget to use their punch card system, they don't advertise it, but after you try their pizza, you'll be at 10 punches in no time!"}
{"text":"We were passing through Middleton on our way back to MKE and the wife wanted to try someplace different, so we did a search on yelp and Novanto came up with 4.8 stars. We were in the mood for pizza so we thought we would give it a try. I had the silsiccia and my wife had the margherita pizza. We were both very pleased with the pizza and the personalized service. We sat outside and they had herb plants next to the tables that they said we could pick to put on our pizza, which I put fresh rosemary on my pizza and it added even more flavor."}
{"text":"Phenomenal. I was a first timer and told the lady working that and she took the time to explain the menu. I appreciated that a lot. It felt like I was truly welcomed. The pizza was priced well and arrived nice and hot and quick. The dough was great. It had a nice toughness to it and texture. The sauce and toppings were great too. I was impressed to here they make their own mozzarella daily. I am looking forward to trying more options on the menu."}
{"text":"Wake up, Madison! Novanta should be slammed every night! This is gourmet pizza -- ain't no pizza joint. Excellent food and service. And no-frills charm."}
{"text":"Great Pizza and salads. Fresh, fast and reasonably priced! Nice carafes of wine available. We enjoy sitting outside in the warmer months at one of their umbrella tables. The staff is always very friendly."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant with my boyfriend today for the first time and we loved everything we had, we are definitely coming back again! The lady at the counter was very nice and also the guys at the back. We ordered the Regina pizza and it was the perfect size for two people (if you are planning to order more food), the crust crunchy and gooey at the same time and such quality ingredients and the wonderful part is that you can taste all of them but in a beautiful light way, I enjoyed every single bite. We also had the Gorgonzola salad which had a great combo of tangy, salty and sweet flavors, it paired perfectly with our pizza. And at the end of our meal we had to have their chocolate truffle with a hazelnut filling, very nice. To be honest, I enjoyed their food so much that I felt spoiled :)"}
{"text":"My wife and I each had pizzas, which were wonderful, but the highlight was probably the delicious buffalo mozzarella. It was smooth and savory and went great with the tomato and basil on the plate.   Ambiance is super casual, and I like that it's quick, but not fast :)"}
{"text":"Well-priced, delicious pizza, using only the freshest ingredients around. Combined with the friendly service (and to die for cannoli), this place easily makes my list of Madison favorites."}
{"text":"Great place with delicious and affordable pizza and fantastic customer service. Don't expect a 5 star dinner setting, but do expect great food."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about this place.  I have recommended this restaurant to a number of people.  I have visited Madison several times for Epic training, and this is the restaurant I have returned to!  The pizza is amazing.  Very fresh, high quality ingredients.  The pizza is the perfect size, and perfectly cooked!  Super fast, too.  Friendly staff and great prices."}
{"text":"This is one of the few places that I constantly crave. Their pizza here is amazing! The flavors are delicious and authentic, and the pizzas are not greasy or too heavy. The restaurant may be small, but don't underestimate this place. I've recommended this place to nearly everyone I've met."}
{"text":"this is a great restaurant in a totally unexpected location- a strip mall by some froyo and chipotle!   pizza is great, comes out fast, fairly priced.  staff wasn't the friendliest and the decor was kind of meh- but the food was definitely worth the trip!"}
{"text":"It was getting late so decided to got to Novanta (90 in Italian) named to have the pizza ready in 90seconds. They have pizza in 2 columns: sauce or no sauce. I ordered a Toscano pizza which was really good, especially when I drizzled some balsamic over it. Pizza was about 9in good portion for $9. I also ordered the buffalo mozzarella with prosciutto and I wish I had ordered more. I couldn't get enough of it!! I then finished off my dinner with chocolate gelato and it was a perfect ending to a great meal.   Foodie scale: 4 Value scale: 4"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, nice to have wine & beer options.  Perfect little pizza cafe to meet up for a lunch or casual dinner.  Wish we had more places like this on far West side."}
{"text":"Pizza is always good, but don't confuse Novanta for your standard, doughy, greasy pie. The light, crispy crust has a delicious, unique flavor from its quick spin in the oven, and the dinner plate sized, individual pizzas are generous (both my husband and I had leftovers). We tried the diavolo and the caserta, and I'd order both again. We also tried out the focaccia, and were offered a choice between olive oil/balsamic or marinara for dipping. We selected the olive oil mix, but if we ordered it again (which is unlikely now that we know how filling the pizzas are), I'd select the marinara as I think it could use the extra punch of flavor as the focaccia is essentially just a seasoned round of the regular pizza dough. The staff was very friendly and helpful in orienting us newcomers. While traffic was steady on the Saturday night we were there, it was never too noisy or crowded to be enjoyable. I'm hoping this place sticks around for the long haul- it was convenient, delicious, and well priced!"}
{"text":"Leave extremely satisfied in the belly and wallet everytime I go. It is kid friendly and fast. The pizza is consistent and of the highest quality ingredients. The service is great as well. Each worker has personal interest in your overall experience."}
{"text":"This place has great Neapolitan Pizza at a great price. This was the first of hopefully many visits.  The staff was very friendly and the restaurant is very clean."}
{"text":"Looking for an authentic, Roman-style pizzeria café? Novanta is your place. When I say Roman-style, I mean the type of café you would find on the streets of Rome. For me, Rome means you can eat nearly anything on the menu, and you know it's going to be fresh, local and delicious. That is Novanta. I've been here several times and have never been disappointed. We always order the salad (to share) and two Margarita pizzas.   Don't know where to begin. I suppose I could start with what it is not. It isn't \"stuff your face\" pizza, like many cheap delivery places. This is hand tossed, wood-fire pizza that has a crusty, chewy base. It's topped with incredible sauce and homemade mozzarella cheese slices. One word: Incredible!  The salad was very fresh and topped with imported olive oil, balsamic vinegar and shaved parmesan.   The price is a bit subjective. Pizza was $7.75 each and the Emiliana salad was $7.50. Now, some people may say, \"Hey, I can order a Pizza Pizza from Little Cearser's for five bucks.\" Yep, they certainly can, and will have about 8 more slices of cardboard, who-knows-where-it-came-from pizza-like thing for nearly the same price. But, that's not Novanta. I have never been disappointed with a meal from here and would HIGHLY recommend it."}
{"text":"I really like the food I got, however, I really wanted pizza and I wish they had gluten free because it looked and smelled soooooo good! My friends loved their food. Its a great new way of having pizza. Don't like what you'r significant other puts on their pizza? No problem because all they do is personalize personal size pizzas! Its a novel concept! I instead got a delicious antipasto salad. The Buffalo Smoked Mozz....... SO GOOD.   Note, you order up front, then sit down."}
{"text":"I visited Novanta on 11/29 for dinner.  I can safely say this was my best experience dining out since moving to Madison 6 years ago.  I can not say enough positive things about this place.  Greeted by Emma who was extremely friendly and very cheerful.  She asked if I had even been there and since I had not she gave some recommendations.  Food was excellent and the atmosphere was great.  I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Ordered Novanta for a work lunch yesterday (about 35 people) and the food was phenomenal...everyone was raving about how good it was. My colleague worked directly with Nick to get the right amount of food and the right mix (pizza, salad, antipasti, and cannolis). We will definitely be using Novanta again for future work events."}
{"text":"we are from out of town and we're looking for a highly rated Italian restaurant. this might well be a great place for pizza, but unfortunately based on the yelp description, we had hoped for a more complete menu of Italian food.  when we got there, we really weren't in the mood for pizza and despite the kind and expert opinion of the young lady who told us everything about every pizza they had,; pizza is just not what we wanted  and so we left and decided to try Naples 15."}
{"text":"How the heck does this place average 4.5 stars on yelp!?!?  Service was great and honestly felt bad giving a 2 as a result but man... the pizza isn't good at all.  The crust was decent.. burned in some areas but flavors were off.  Sausage was pretty much breakfast sausage crumbled on top... salad was all arugula and not great dressing.  Again service fantastic... food was middling to bad.. I felt depressed while eating... Aldis fresh pizza take home and heat up blows this place out of the water"}
{"text":"Swung bye with some friends for lunch and decided to up the rating to 5 stars. I love the simple regina pizza with smoked buffalo mozzarella.  The burst of tangy tomatoes combined with smoky cheese is a definate comfort food.   On this occasion I sampled their house made mozzerella cheese plate with all the meat choices. Spicy salami and prosciutto are the winners for me. Also their mozzerella is the best I have had and look forward to having its salty goodness again.  I also tried the connoli, but like their tiramisu I am not of fan of the current dessert recipes and hope they improve them to same standard as their pizzas.  Thanks Novanata for the delicious meal."}
{"text":"Really great individual pizzas, gourmet salads and food comes extremely quick to the table.  I tried one of the tomato sauce pizzas and one with the pesto sauce and both were quite delicious.  I wish they had more toasted sandwich variety because I bet they would be really awesome."}
{"text":"The pizza is fantastic, with high quality ingredients and perfectly-done crust.  It's the kind of meal that leaves you feeling pleased and satisfied, but not heavy.  Would definitely recommend based on the food alone.   However, it is the staff who make this such a pleasant and warm experience.  The young man at the register was enthusiastic, gracious, and helpful.  We all assumed he was the owner based on his exceptional service, but he was just an employee. Wow!"}
{"text":"Yeah, this place is absolutely delicious. Don't let its suburban strip mall location deceive you. Fresh and tasty made to order pizzas and a variety of accompanying appetizers. There are no wrong choices here. Buon appetito!"}
{"text":"Love love love Novanta.  A place where I can not only eat a delicious \"grown up\" meat but my kids also enjoy it.  Thin, crispy perfectly charred edges on Novanta's pizza lead to a chewy, never soggy middle area.  I can't remember the name of my fave but it includes prosciutto, cherry tomatoes, arugula.  Phenomenal.  Great cannoli too.  Great friendly service keeps us coming back for more!"}
{"text":"This pizza is amazing , light and tasty! Made fresh everyday mozzarella cheese all ingredients are fresh as can be . Service is fast and with extremely friendly staff who put there heart into everything they make! A traditional style Italian pizza you must try!"}
{"text":"Tried Novanta based on other Yelp reviews.  Steered us right again.  Nice clean interior, stylish tables & chairs, with a beautiful mosaic wood oven to make the pizzas, etc.  We received our pizza in short order but it wasn't what had been ordered.  After confirming someone else was not waiting for it, we decided to just keep it even though a new pizza was offered several times.  Before we left, we received a card for our next visit and a scrumptious cannoli.  None of this was needed since the pizza we kept was quite delicious but still the gesture from the friendly staff was appreciated.  The crust was from a very good in-house dough (also used to bake their rustic bread...a yummy taste, too).  The toppings were plentiful and the tomato based sauce carried it home.  They also have a non-tomato based pizza using olive oil, etc. + other salads and dining items.  Long and short of it, worth the trip and will be back again."}
{"text":"Waiting for my pizza and just had to make a quick note. Staff here are so lovely. You can tell they truly care about your experience."}
{"text":"Very good pizza. Could use a little more toppings though. The Nutella stuffed pizza is definitely worth saving room for dessert. Prices are great. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I visited Novanta for the first time this past Friday. The space is small and is reminiscent of Pizza Brutta on Monroe Street. I placed a take out order for two pizzas, a salad and one tiramisu. Then I waited awkwardly hovering near the pizza prep area behind the glass wall for my take out order to be ready, as there really is no designated waiting area. This restaurant is kid friendly and several families were seated throughout the restaurant. About twenty minutes later an employee called my name and my order was ready. I was pleasantly surprised by the cost of my order and really appreciate that this place makes quality pizzas affordable. I ordered the Regina pizza with buffalo mozzarella and mushrooms as an add-on. It was delicious. At first glance I thought it was heavy on the tomato sauce and light on the cheese portions, but in the end it was the perfect balance. The 4 cheese pizza was also outstanding. We really enjoyed the gorgonzola salad, the lettuce was fresh and the dressing accompanied it perfectly. The tiramisu did not disappoint! At $5, the round shaped tiramisu seemed to be one of the only items priced a bit steep.  I will definitely return, likely to eat inside the restaurant next time with our kiddos. Novanta's pizza is better than Pizza Brutta's, without a doubt.  With as many take out orders as this venue gets, my only recommendation is that they shore up the take out process a little with a designated waiting area and develop a better notification system that your order is ready."}
{"text":"Fresh pizza, take out price. Everyone had Margerita. But don't expect this place to be a high end restaurant."}
{"text":"This place serves delicious pizza & salads at a reasonable price. They use fresh ingredients and have very friendly employees. It is definitely one of my favorite pizza places in Madison."}
{"text":"I would give this spot 10 stars if I could. This is as close as it gets to real Italian pizza, which I have eaten plenty of in Italy. That means, great crust, and no \"American\" tomato sauce, but rather a good fresh, ground, uncooked tomato sauce that gets cooked in the oven. The pepperoni is not like you get in the US. It is sausage resembling more of a home made pepperoni with strong pork flavor. The mozzarella cheese is made fresh and the parmesan is real, no fillers. Salads are generous and very tasty with a simple dressing. The owner and staff are very on point to make sure you know what you are getting and do a fantastic job at making you comfortable. The only downside I experienced was that the glass of wine is small. I don't know what their pour is but it is the only thing not generously given. Not served in a traditional stemmed glass, it was more like a small 1/2 full glass of fruit juice. But I went for the pizza, not the wine. Also, short wait time. The pizza bakes in 90 seconds once it is in the oven. Novanta means 90."}
{"text":"The pizza oven is heated to a toasty 900 degrees Fahrenheit so that a fresh-made pizza only takes 90 seconds to come out perfect. I could see the pizza chefs watching over our pizzas, like expectant pizza fathers, guiding and turning the tasty circles until they were ready to complete their journey to our table.  You can imagine what happened to them once they got there.  Yum.  The service was friendly and the restaurant is inviting. Awesome Neapolitan pizza baked in 90 seconds?!?! Life. Is. Good."}
{"text":"This place is serious about their pizza and attention to detail. It is excellent, clean, service is great, affordable & they have Coca-Cola! I really enjoy this place. Everything is homemade."}
{"text":"We didn't try everything on the menu, but I'll give a 5-star to what we did have.    We were greeted warmly by 2 employees; one was delivering a small order to a business a few doors down and the other described many of the items on the menu for us.  The dough and mozzarella are made fresh daily (among other ingredients I would bet).  There is not a huge selection other than the pizzas, but that is what we were in the mood for.    We had the Margherita, Salsiccia (Italian sausage, mushrooms, garlic and basil), and the Vegetariana (Roasted peppers, olives, mushrooms and basil). We loved all 3 and will be back soon to try the others.  The Vegetariana was my least favorite, but I would eat it every time; that's how good the pizza was."}
{"text":"Thank Grecian Goddess our car steered here after reading awesome yelp reviews!  Amazingly yummy woodfire pizza crafted with ALL fresh ingredients... They have only 1 size 'za = 10\" but it is under 10 bucks! A gem of a find!  Stop in for a snack with a buddie... or take some of Italy home with you!"}
{"text":"Their pizza is absolutely delicious!  I have had their pizza as well as their salads and both are fresh, delicious and flavorful.  The mozzarella is by far the best I've ever had.    A previous reviewer went to Naples 15 and I have been to both (as well as Porta Alba), and by far, Novanta and Porta Alba pizza is superb compared to Naples 15.    This is a great place!"}
{"text":"First, I have to say that I think Pizza Brutta is the best pizza in Madison. That said, Novanta has a parking lot and is on my side of town.  Pizza here is tasty crispy thin crust Neopolitan style, with housemade mozzarella and open kitchen concept.  Paninis, salads, mozzarella bar, and small selection of beer/wine are also here, but we stuck to pizza for the first visit. Everyone here was super nice and seemed happy to be working, making the casual dining experience better, important since the gray chairs are not comfortable. Take out orders were popular while we were there. FYI - the servers will bring your food to you, and they bus it after you leave. No trash cans in the dining room. Would highly recommend to Neopolitan pizza lovers"}
{"text":"I love Novanta! The pizza is great. They have multiple vegetarian options, and you can also build your own. I always seem to order the Toscano - it is so tasty!  I've dined in and also gotten take out multiple times. Service is super fast at dinnertime.  I haven't stopped for lunch yet, so I can't vouch for how quickly you can get in and out during a busy work-week lunch hour. Novanta is a great addition to the dining options on Old Sauk!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, great variety, quick.  Ohh and they make their own mozarella on site!"}
{"text":"Just a few miles from our house. Very friendly service, good pasta and excellent brick oven pizza. Nice place to take the family to relax for a meal.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza, easy and quick service. I got the Pesto pizza, without tomatos, sub spicy pepperoni and added fresh garlic. It was absolutely delicious! Highly recommend this place. Excellent service!"}
{"text":"Don't miss this hidden gem! I'd been visiting this strip mall for years before visiting here. My terrible loss! Little did I know I was missing out on excellent salads, pizza and desserts! Ingredients from Italy! I've always had great service on my visits as well."}
{"text":"I'm salivating just thinking about the fresh tomato sauce generously spread atop an airy, crispy crust. My mom and I loved the Margherita pizza served here! My step-dad had the bolognese, which is unfortunately the only pasta they serve at this establishment. Come for the pizza, my Yelp friends. I usually stick with Pizza Brutta to get my wood fire fix, but this place is on par in my book! Simple ingredients, fast and friendly service, and an easy lunch spot since you're able to pay when you order. It's a no-nonsense, no-frills pit-stop pizza place. I might consider getting my food to go next time, as it's a little bit crowded."}
{"text":"We didn't plan to make a special trip here and didn't have super-high expectations, but on our first visit, Novanta prepared us some really tasty, fresh individual pizzas with quality ingredients.  The atmosphere is pleasant and casual, with unpadded banquets (a bit uncomfortable), metal moderne bistro chairs, and bare wooden tables.   The restaurant appeared to be very clean, although since kitchen and prep areas are visible to customers at their tables, you must ensure that floors are clean, that you sweep under racks and cabinets every night.   Also -- staff should be wearing food prep gloves when not prepping food. We saw our chef take out the garbage while still wearing gloves, then returning to the kitchen where he may have kept the same gloves on.   The staff appeared professional and even courteous on our first visit but on our second visit, our order-taker was suddenly seized by an urge to say something a bit odd and not at all flattering about my appearance. Not a big deal, but I'm just wondering what the upside is of ever going down that path with a paying customer.   Even so, the food was pretty good this time, as well.  Finally, while Novanta gets an A for effort with regard to the new, large B&W photos on the wall (apparently depicting steps in cheese-making processes) -- but, truth be told, these are NOT appetizing photos. Not at all. I don't wanna look at these vats of gooey, white pus while I'm try to eat.   We might be back. In the meantime, management should have a sit down with their chatty servers, covering some of the basics of customer service.   Docked a star for dopey counter-people and huge, gross wall photos."}
{"text":"This was our date night pick before heading to the theater to see Fantastic Beasts (great movie- highly recommend). We recently were in Italy and had AMAZING pizza there, but thought this place could at least come close based on what I read. And we were right! Not quite as good as authentic Italian pizza, but pretty dang close. Wood-fired and made to order, the add-ons of prosciutto and buffalo mozzarella were worth it. The glass of wine was a little pricey for the size, but it was a nice house-red. The cannolis were nothing special, but the husband enjoyed the specialty dessert of a graham cracker cake.  I do wish they listed the size of the pizza on the menu board. We were not aware of the size and ordered 1 to split. They are small enough that 1 is a enough for one person, and we probably could have gotten our own.  I do love that they offer take-out and if I lived any closer, that could be very dangerous for my wallet with the prices they offer.  The space is a little off-putting with how small and narrow it is and they have sports tv's around the restaurant as well. I would have been okay with just the music in the background and no tv's. Takes away from the Italian ambiance."}
{"text":"Being from Chicago I am extremely picky when it comes to pizza and hands down Novanta is the best local pizza place in the surrounding Madison area. Great service every time, always delicious, and never disappointed. If you haven't been here I highly recommend going and indulge in the graham cracker cake too because it's fantastic!"}
{"text":"Just got done with lunch. This is the real deal if you are looking for a nice Italian pizza. They use San Marzano tomatoes for their red sauce, which is the only way to go. Their crust has just a hint of salt and is crunchy and chewy all at the same time, simply amazing. The mozzarella was definitely fresh but didn't leave big puddle of water , meaning they probably pressed excess water out ( again the only way to go unless you like puddles in your pizza). Finally I ordered a cannoli that was just as amazing! This is a great place for lunch or diner. Don't worry the food comes out very quickly from their awesome oven!"}
{"text":"The owner and his staff are EXTREMELY friendly. The pizza is awesome, and is the freshest pizza I've ever had. I have never had a bad experience. Keep up the great work!!"}
{"text":"I'm completely, 100 percent addicted to this place. Fresh, light, authentic, hot pizza. Love that I can build my own and eat my own personal pizza. Love the water station and the atmosphere, including the music! You have to know what you want tho because it's an order first, then sit place. Go. Now. You'll thank me."}
{"text":"A really nice change-of-pace from the typical disgusting pizza places that plague Madison, such as Rocky's, Pizza Hut, Roman Candle, Toppers, etc.  The mozzarella was very fresh and we enjoyed the Neapolitan Style pizza. Not to mention, the pizza is done start to finish in about 2 minutes."}
{"text":"Really great deal here. Small place with impressive oven and delightful staff crank out delicious pizza in a few minutes. Happened upon this place to my total surprise.  Had the Biance Pesto pizza with a glass of Pinot Grigio after a long day of work. Best 15 bucks I've spent in a while. See you guys soon! Ciao!"}
{"text":"Fabulous pizza place. Was in town for a conference. Looking for something casual. This was the perfect spot. Staff was helpful and friendly. The pizzas are the size of a dinner plate. The crust was perfect and the ingredients were authentic. They make their mozzarella daily in house! Who does that?!?! They do!"}
{"text":"Novanta is arguably the best pizzeria in the Madison area. From the homemade dough to the high quality toppings, this is what a pizza should taste like. The ingredients are simple. You won't find one of those ghastly 'Mac and Cheese' pizzas here. This is just fundamental pizza at its best. It's pure, simple, and absolutely scrumptious.  --The dough-- Everything right in a pizza starts with good dough. The dough has a strong, solid flavor which is delicious by itself. The dough is slightly chewy rolled out thin with a crunchy exterior courtesy of the wood-burning oven.  --The Sauce-- Sweet, tangy but not overpowering. Compliments the dough and toppings perfectly and is that perfect middle-layer.   --the Toppings-- Veggies are always fresh and the cheese is high quality. I personally think the real stars are the Italian meats they use for toppings.  --Personal Favorites-- Marghertia  Diavoli   --Service-- Orders come out within 10 minutes of ordering and the staff are very friendly.  Pizzas are reasonably priced for the quality.  --Final Thoughts-- If you live on the Madison area and are craving pizza, then go to Novanta! Once you eat their pizza you are guaranteed to never enjoy any other local pizza the same!"}
{"text":"I like it but I am not quite over the moon yet. Been in a couple of times.  Here's some highlights: Clean, fast, polite and tasty!   Food is very good, you can watch them putting your order together and put into the super duper hotty oven for 90 seconds.   The price on these smaller pizza's though is a bit off putting when one person can eat a whole pizza themselves.  You nearly need to order a pizza per person based upon what other food you are serving. I stayed recently and ate in the back dining room.  The staff was courteous, checked in on us, even though its not a \"real\" sit down restaurant.  It was quite busy through dinner time which is always good.  I'll be back but not when I'm really hungry."}
{"text":"So happy that the folks who operate Cafe Porta Alba decided to work with their former head chef to open a partnership operation close to my office! Novanta, which means '90 seconds' in Italian, is much more laid back than its cousin but serves up the same delicious offerings. That 90 seconds of bake time for their authentic Neopolitan pizzas. I like my pizzas simple, few ingredients, and this place delivers and still packs in the flavor. Today I ordered off of the 'Fai Da Te' (Build Your Own) menu, starting with the 'Nicola' pie base. This is the dough, olive oil, basil, and sea salt. You then have many topping options to choose from including meats,  cheeses, vegetarian, and 'Specialitá'. I went with Pecorino Romano, house-made mozzarella, and Prosciutto di Parma...nice and light but probably a little too salty for some peoples tastebuds. I ordered for pick-up but had I ordered when I got there, I probably would have gotten the Lombarda, which was todays special. I have had that in the past and it epitomizes 'flavorful simplicity'. Using only bread (dough), pears, gorgonzola, and then adding arugula after the 90 seconds in the 900 degree oven, the result is a cascade of sweet and savory on your tongue. It is truly an epicurean work of art! Standard menu pizzas under the Pizze Bianche header, that also use the Nicola base, include the Parma (house mozzarella, prosciutto, arugula, cherry tomatoes), Toscano (house mozzarella,  cherry tomatoes,  roasted peppers,  roasted onions, garlic, basil), and another one of my favorites, the Quattro Formaggi (house mozzarella,  Pecorino Romano,  fontina, gorgonzola,  basil). Other standard pizza offerings on the menu use the 'Margherita' base, which is bread, crushed tomatoes, house mozzarella,  and olive oil. These pizzzas include the Vegetariana (roasted peppers, olives, mushrooms, basil), the Diavola (spicy salame, roasted onion, basil), and the Napoletana (anchovies, basil). In addition to the pizza, Novanta offers paninis and a great Mozzarella bar! They serve beer, wine, soft drinks, and espresso! The latter goes well with the various dessert offerings including tiramasu, gelatto...including chocolate truffle gelatto (!), and sorbetto. While Novanta is not quite a place I would think of going to for that special anniversary dinner, it is a great special casual destination that will be sure to please."}
{"text":"Downright delicious. Creative, affordable and adventurous! Try it. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Walked to this place for dinner last night and it was worth the walk. Laid back little place where the cook your pizza fast in their stone oven.   I had the pesto pizza and added chicken on top. The pesto flavor was real good; the one knock was that there wasn't much chicken on the pizza and I paid a little extra to add it. The fresh mozzarella definitely adds to the flavor and uniqueness of their pizzas that you do not get at most places.  Great place and worth the try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Really a fantastic place. The mozzarella boards are a nice spin on appetizers, and can be a meal in themselves. The pizza is fantastic, made with quality ingredients, and comes out fast. A board and a pie make a great  meal to split for two.  The house red is pretty great as well - on the dryer side,  fyi.  And the canoli. Oh god,  the canoli. Eat it.   One pizza, one mozzarella board, a carafe of house red, and a canoli: ~$40.  Sit down ambiance along the lines of Cosi  Cafe."}
{"text":"We only recently discovered this place after seemingly everyone else has already eaten here -- it is absolutely fantastic! The prices and the pizzas are absolutely fantastic and every meal we've had here has been extremely satisfying. We especially like the Salsiccia and Alice pizzas. My wife is not usually a pizza fan and this is her favorite pizza place. Some of the best food in Madison!"}
{"text":"Yummy salads, pizzas, and deserts.  Not too expensive and I will be back!  My favorite features pear and gorganzola"}
{"text":"Good, fast, but not cheap. I thought the idea was fun, food was really tasty. The cheese bar was \"ehh\"."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza anywhere in the world, Italy included.   No BS. For example, water cups and lemon out so there's no having to ask.   Counter order and pay then wait for it at your table so no waiter overhead.   The mozzarella bar is also excellent."}
{"text":"I have gone here twice.  The first time I accidentally ordered the pizza instead of the Cheese platter. (too long of a story to explain) They were both tasty!  Your pizza is ready within 2 minutes after you've ordered and paid.  It was fresh and tasty and everything is very fresh.  Fresh mozzarella from WI is what I tried instead of the imported smoked- I try to suppose local everywhere I go.  The only drawback, the parking spot you're vying for with everyone else at the strip mall."}
{"text":"This gourmet pizza place serves beautiful mouthwatering pizzas in a genuinely friendly atmosphere. You'll have to control your impulses (or not) as they have sumptuous looking cannoli and fresh mozzarella  right next to their register. Great for dine in or take out. As for portion size, one pizza is just about enough for two people in my experience.  Try the Salsiccia, which is my favorite."}
{"text":"Consistent quality of food and service- better than it's sister restaurant Cafe Porta Alba! The staff is super friendly and personal! Love this place!!!!"}
{"text":"I agree! Smells great inside. Friendly helpful staff The crust was fantastic. Tasty fresh ingredients Served fast  Comfortable dining room  Sing along soft music Great value for the money This is what all the places like Blaze, Pie Five, MOD and more are trying to duplicate.  Worth the trip!"}
{"text":"If I had to choose one place in Madison to eat at this very minute, it would be Novanta.  This, however, is a rather new revelation.  My first visit to Novanta was over a year ago. I had a Capri Panini with mozzarella, basil, and cherry tomatoes. My recollection is that it was just okay. The ingredients were good, but the bread was a bit too crunchy for my liking.  The ambiance was nice, the staff friendly, but I wasn't uber impressed with the food.  Fast forward a few months. My husband and I needed a quick dinner, and we stopped at Novanta where I had a Margherita pizza. (Are you noticing that I have thing for mozzarella + tomatoes + basil?!)  Again, I recall it being decent, but nothing that I HAD to have again.  My true love for Novanta was realized after I decided to step outside of my little tomato and mozzarella box and try something different. I opted for the Toscano, which is a white pizza with mozzarella, tomatoes, basil (I know, I know...) AND roasted peppers, onions, and garlic. Seriously...it was like the heavens opened up and angels sang. I'm not even kidding. The Toscano might be the perfect pizza.  Aside from the fact that it tastes incredible, it's so stinkin' pretty! It looks like a rainbow! Who doesn't want to eat a rainbow that was created totally free of artificial coloring!?  I know I do.  The ingredients are fresh. The cheese is perfect. The crust is just the right amount of crispy. I've not eaten the Toscano like...five times, and I'm never disappointed. I would eat this pizza every day of the week and twice on Sunday. See...I like it so much that now I'm quoting my 85 year old grandfather.  On one visit, the hostess suggested we try the Nutella Pizza.  If you don't like Nutella, don't eat this. If you do like, Nutella, it's amazing. I was not expecting much. I've had my fair share of underwhelming dessert pizzas, but this one was so well done. Again - the crust was the perfect level of crispy, the nutella was melty and yummy, and it was topped with cocoa and powdered sugar.  I have contemplated going to Novanta JUST for the Nutella pizza...I still may.  Finally, I cannot say enough good things about the staff.  Every time we have been there (both dining in and taking out) the employees have been chatty, friendly, and helpful. A man, who I assume to be the manager or owner, is always visiting and talking with the customers in a welcoming, casual way.  When we brought my 3.5 year old son, who can be a bit rowdy and/or crabby, the hostess stopped over numerous times to chat with him and keep him happy and distracted. She went above and beyond in her interactions with us. Sometimes servers are overbearing with their constant inquiries and requests, but this is not the case. I feel like everyone who works at Novanta truly enjoys their job.   If you are on the West Side and want a fairly quick and delicious meal, definitely check out Novanta...and let me know so I can stop by for a Toscano."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Novanta on a Sunday and were greeted right away when we came here.  We needed a minute to look at the menu though, since we had never been here before.  The woman working at the counter walked away while we thought about what we wanted.  She came back when more people came in.  She greeted them and told them they could skip us in line because we were thinking about what we wanted.  It would've been nice if she checked to see if we were ready before she let people skip us, but she didn't bother.  The woman who skipped us in line was part of a group.  Some of the group skipped us while some of the group did not.  When it was time to order my boyfriend and I each ordered pizza and tiramisu.  The woman told us that they didn't make any tiramisu that day, so it was not available.  We then decided to just go with 2 pizzas.  The group of 6 who we ordered in the middle of all got their food before us.  I then saw my pizza was ready about 5 minutes before my boyfriend's pizza.  By the time our entire order was ready my pizza was room temperature.  The pizza tasted pretty good.  I got a margherita pizza.  I was disappointed that one of my four slices of pizza didn't have any cheese on it.  Part of the crust was burnt to a point that I didn't eat it.  Had there been a little more cheese and it would've been cooked correctly, I think this pizza would've been good.  There's a lot of potential here, but potential isn't enough to go back any time soon.  There are just too many other pizza options in the city."}
{"text":"I showed up to Novanta in a really cranky mood and determined to hate it. Because I'm that guy.  But, I didn't hate it. I liked it. A LOT.  I had a pizza with garlic, sausage, and mushrooms, and it was AMAZE. The sauce? I would love to just ladle that into my mouth. it was so incredibly flavorful and delicious. The cheese was amazing, the sausage was broken up nicely and scattered all over the pizza--as opposed to just having giant chunks of sausage here and there. Same with the mushrooms and basil.   I was a little wary, because I read complaints about cracker-like crust, and lack of flavor, but I didn't experience that at all. Everything was great. I recommend grabbing yourself a peetza, and will definitely be back to try something else out."}
{"text":"If you are looking for great, fast pizza at a reasonable price, look no farther.  Wonderful wood-fired deliciousness.  They have other items available, as well.  But all we have ever had is the pizza."}
{"text":"Amazing service and amazing food. The folks here love what they do and prepare their food with a lot of love and meticulous care. Would definitely come back again and again and again. Highly recommend. Their cannoli and tiramisu was delicious. Pizza crust was soft and chewy and substantial. Fresh toppings, fresh salads. Perfect place!"}
{"text":"This was our very first time at Novanta, and didn't really know what to expect... We arrived at 10:59 AM on a Saturday morning... The sign said \"Closed\" but we decided to pull in to get a closer look... They opened at 11:00 and Nicole met me at the door with a bright smile, as she was flipping the sign to \"Open\"  And welcomed us in as their first customers of the Day.   The restaurant itself is very bright and clean and the food displayed in the cases and the fresh pizza ingredients all looked fresh and recently stocked.  The menus are very easy to read, and the choices, while simple, were still overwhelming as EVERYTHING looked and sounded Delicious.  The next person we met was Nick* who also welcomed us to Novanta introduced himself, and was extremely friendly, down to earth and very helpful.    We told him this was our first time at the Novanta, and he welcomed us, introduced us to the rest of the staff, and asked if we would like a personal run down of their menu items, and a walk through of their process...  We gladly accepted his offer, and were treated with a very detailed overview of the products, and the history behind the store and the fresh and house made as well as imported products, and ingredients they offer, Nick is someone who exudes passion for what he does.  That alone would have made this a fire star experience...   But then we ordered and received our food...   I ordered the Vegetariana pizza, and my wife ordered the Clasico Panini both featured their House Mozzarella and fresh local ingredients...  Before I could finish pulling up Yelp on my phone, and started to Check in, our food was being delivered to our table.  NOT FAST FOOD... Fresh Food Served Fast...    You can watch them build your pizza from scratch, by hand, and follow it into the  European Brick oven for a quick \"Novanta\" (90) Second bake in the 900 degree Wood Fired Oven.  The end result is a beautifully, slightly charred chewy crisp crust topped with a perfect blend of ingredients.   The Panini selections can be viewed from the counter, many examples are assembled, and ready to be pressed into perfection in the Panini maker... Here too, you can see the selection of available ingredients, and watch them hand cut the fine meats to a thin perfection.  The Panini came with a side salad of mixed greens and their house olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette.   Both plates arrived hot, and fresh.  They were both visually pleasing to look at, and the portions were very well balanced.   Both were excellent in flavor and textures.  The Panini golden crisp on the outside, with a perfect blend of flavors from the meat, cheese and tomato center.  The pizza crust was perfection, a few charred (but not too charred) spots on the crust gave a true Neapolitan style pizza flavor... It was also one of the more tender wood fired crusts that I have experienced... Very light, and soft, yet crisp and charred.  The perfect blend of flavors and crushed tomatoes (which they do right in the store) It was heaven on a plate!  :)    If you go, bring a friend... Each order something different and share it... You wont regret it... and it will help you to get through the menu a little faster the next time around... Cause you will be back!    * We found out later that Nick was one of the owners of the establishment.  His pride, and passion for what he does, really shines through, not only in the food he serves, but also in the staff and atmosphere of the store as well."}
{"text":"The pizzas are made to order with fresh ingredients. Their 900 degree oven makes the pizzas in 90 seconds - hence their name.   The atmosphere is laid back and we witnessed many people picking up their pizzas to go.   Now the food: The crust is thin and light and easy to cut. My partner ordered from the Pizze Bianche menu and got the Toscano pizza made with house mozzarella, cherry tomatoes, roasted peppers, roasted onions, garlic, and basil. I ordered from the Pizze Rosse menu and got the Caserta pizza made with salame, roasted peppers, roasted onion and oregano. Both were popping with flavor and did resemble the pizza in Italy. Since the pizza is thin, you don't get a stomach ache after finishing off the entire personal pizza.  I think the next time we will try their mozzarella bar or paninis! And don't forget the Vino!!"}
{"text":"Very good wood fired pizza w homemade mozzarella. Each pie serves one and prices reasonable. Service was great and quick at lunch. Would go again."}
{"text":"I find myself craving this pizza about 3 to 4 times a week. It's become a staple in my household. My one year old son even loves it! Really you need to try it to become a Novanta believer! Hands down the best pizza place I'm Madison. A true Napoli style pizza parlor."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town. I am not a pizza person, but I would name this restaurant as my most favorite pizza place in Madison. The price is reasonable and the waiter/waitress is friendly. It is a very nice restaurant for lunch."}
{"text":"It just can't get any better for what I had. House Mozzarella is really to die for, it just can't get any more fresh fresh or better, it can't cost less and you can't eat more than what is served.  Presentation: Excellent. Freshness: Excellent Ingridents used: Excellent, Cheery tomaties, pesto.."}
{"text":"Very good pizza. I also had the arugula salad which was even better in my opinion. I will definitely eat here again when I'm in Wisconsin."}
{"text":"I'm Italian and I have been l've been living in the US for 7 years. This is hands down the best pizza place I've been to in this country. In fact, Novanta would be a great pizza place even in Italy.  Pizza to me is not about how many toppings you put on it. Even a simple Margherita has to taste good.  Novanta is great Napoli-style pizza, fresh mozzarella, correct toppings (not friggin pineapple and 20 different things on your pizza)!  I recommend their Regina with Buffalo mozzarella and basil and pretty much all of their pizzas. Pair with a Mexican coke or a Spotted cow and you had a great day. On your way out you can buy some of their homemade mozzarella for a few bucks.  Really a great gem!"}
{"text":"Ordered lunch for 12 people for our office and they went over and above.  Helped me carry everything to my car and made sure there was enough parmesan and red pepper for the many pizzas ordered.  Food was absolutely delicious and would definitely order again."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch today and really enjoyed it. As stated by others, the place is sort of small and can be a bit dark near the back, the decor is minimal but it has a nice clean look. We were greeted immediately upon entering and the service was great. I had the Caserta pizza, my daughter had the Margherita, and my mother had the Vegetariana. The pizzas were out to the table quickly and tasted great. The sauce is fresh, the mozzarella is outstanding.  The fresh ingredients really stand out, this is not your typical greasy chain pizza. The prices are very reasonable for what you get. We also ordered a Nutella pizza to go, trust me, you need one of these. We will be back again soon."}
{"text":"Tiny spot in a strip area in the Middleton suburbs. But what it lacks in location of makes up in taste. The pizza was so delicious. Fresh ingredients definitely make a big difference. And the fresh buffalo mozzarella, pesto and bread were a great starter. Good lunch spot or low key dinner. Smells amazing with the open room and custom pizza oven."}
{"text":"Great place for kids. Laid back atmosphere which we loved, yet still hip and cool. Food was delicious! I felt like I was in Europe when we tasted the food. We ordered 4 pizzas all yummy (no we are not total pigs, the pizzas are individual sizes) , and we also had delicious arugula and prosciutto salad; which was heavenly. What i liked is that their menu is big enough to keep you coming back to try different things."}
{"text":"Hands down - the best pizza around! We've been here a few different times and we're never disappointed!!! The people here are amazing, but that's just a bonus. The pizza and fresh mozzarella are amazing!!! Cooked to perfection, high quality ingredients, even the cannolis are incredible! If the last thing I ever ate was the house made fresh mozzarella, I'd die a happy gal! Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"The pizza is excellent, the service very good and friendly, prices are very fair! Overall great experience and highly recommended. The graham cracker cake that was recommended was great as well. Will definitely return we when we're back in Madison."}
{"text":"Love this pizza every time, it never disappoints! Friendly staff, and great atmosphere. We usually get it to go, and it's always great. Pizzas are a little small so we usually order two or three. The desserts are really good too!"}
{"text":"Fresh, fast and flavorful...what's not to love!?!  We ordered at the register and grabbed a table.    The hubs and I split a Gorgonzola salad and margherita pizza.  Salad was awesome; walnuts and dried cranberries w/and balsamic and olive oil dressing.  The pizza was was also really good.  It comes in one size fits all, which happens to be about a 10\" Napoli style pizza that's cut into 4 big wedge slices.  It could easily be eaten solo or shared if y'all's appetite is light or you're ordering other items.  Perfect for a quick lunch or fast dinner."}
{"text":"Writing this review after my second visit. My family and I have tried 3 pizzas and a appetizer.   The pizzas were: Lombardo, Diavola and Pesto. They are Italian style in that they are light on sauce, toppings and cheese. Brick oven style crust. Personal sized. We all liked the Diavola and Pesto. The Lombardo not so much. The pears really did not work on a pizza. Too bland.   For the appetizer we had the Mozzarella bar with prosciutto and balsamic vinegar. Simply divine. Freshest cheese imaginable.   It's a bit pricey for the pizzas imo but I could live on that mozzarella.   Definitely worth a visit...for a lunch."}
{"text":"We were staying at a hotel nearby. Really delicious pizza, super fresh!! Kids loved it, adults loved it! We have 2 margharita pizzas, a \"build your own\" (spicy salami is really good) and a salad.  The staff went above and beyond and were extremely accommodating. Our entire experience was wonderful!"}
{"text":"Awesome just awesome!!  I was a bit concerned about an authentic Italian oven pizza that was cooked on 90 seconds flat, but it was great!!  The 900 degree oven does the job.  The flavored fresh, the crust was just right, the cheese tasted homemade, perfect!  Great salad as well, very generous serving.  Casual and friendly, and well priced.  Bonus feature is that they have a nice wine selection to go with your meal."}
{"text":"Novanta is the closest thing I've had to real Nepalese Pizza, but better (better because I'm accustomed to the extreme flavors and toppings of America) anyways, it's really good.  The menu is simple, and you can make additions to any pizza. We got two pizzas each delicious, but the Salsiccia was the standout! Next time we will be going after the mozzarella bar, because the mozzarella was definitely Noavanta's all star ingredient.    If you are about the Nepalese pizza and you are in the Madison area, I cannot recommend a place more."}
{"text":"Everything I've tried here is so, so good. Their mozzarella is really incredible. In addition to my margherita pizza I had some graham cracker cake (pictured) for dessert, which was also delicious. More like a mousse than cake, but who cares? Even the moscato was well above average. The prices are reasonable too, so I'm a big fan all around!"}
{"text":"If you are dreaming of Naples but only have a few minutes to spare, stop by Novata to sample their delicious pizza or other Italian treats.  I ordered the Salisiccia, which had a nice balance of mushrooms, sausage and cheese. The crust was flavorful with just the right balance of crispy and chewy goodness. The kitchen offered a large selection of pizza choices so I could find the \"one.\"  The restaurant was neat and clean although somewhat lacking in ambiance. The staff was friendly and courteous and went out of their way to provide exemplary service, stopping by at least twice during the meal to ensure our satisfaction.  If I am ever in the Middleton area again (I live in California), I'll be stopping by again. Five stars."}
{"text":"Pizza is great and so are the desserts, well I can speak for the tiramisu... it was delicious! The staff is so friendly and helpful! I love this place!"}
{"text":"Never been to Cafe Porta Alba, so I have no preconceived notions. I like the options, the menu is a good size, they have wine/beer which is great. I've eaten here twice so far, both times it was delicious. Staff nice, Nick friendly and outgoing.  I thought the interior was a little bland and the industrial chairs didn't fit the look to me. However, that being said, after eating the food I decided I really didn't care. The food holds it's own and doesn't really need a fluffy atmosphere to sell me on the taste.  It's going to be one of my go-to places. I like the prices and the quality. I hope they do well in that mall, it is hard to find parking, especially over the lunch rush."}
{"text":"Pizza is perfect. Really nice. Has a fast food feel but slightly more upscale. The young owner brought us our food. But 3 stars bc it's a little overpriced but seriously, tasty!"}
{"text":"Novanta is basically Pizza Brutta on the West side of town instead of Monroe, and that's a good thing! They both serve Neapolitan style pizzas and salads, and they're both very good. Basically, read my review on Pizza Brutta, and you'll have my thoughts on Novanta. But note a couple differences: - The prices at Novanta are a little cheaper (About $2 a pizza) - Pizza Brutta has a couple more pizza varieties to choose from - Pizza Brutta has more of a local ingredient emphasis, but that isn't to say that they both don't use high quality ingredients. Brutta just brands that more as part of their image, and i'm a sucker for that sort of thing.  But yeah, it's a good spot, and it definitely beats out the other options in this mall (Chipotle, Chin's)"}
{"text":"Was great! I'm visiting from CA and since I didn't know much about the place I asked for help and The staff helped me out and was super friendly!  Wisconsin mozzarella cheese ball with cherry tomatoes, bread and olive oil-balsamic vinegar and pesto was a great appetizer I also had the vegetarian salad and... The Nutella pizza. OMGsh! So good!  Very good prices! Can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"Novanta is hands down the best pizza joint in Madison. They have a great location, great pizza, fast service and great employees working there. I recommend this place to all my friends when they come down to Madison."}
{"text":"The pizza here actually compares with Naples. Amazing. But the best part by far is the employees. Extremely happy, nice, and helpful. Once here with my 9 year old son and when we were leaving he said \"we HAVE to give everyone here a HUGE tip. They are amazing!\" From a 9 year old that's pretty incredible. It's a little pricey, but definitely worth the experience."}
{"text":"Stopped in based on prior Yelp reviews and pictures. Loved it! I had the off-the-menu Novanta, or salad pizza: arugula, cherry tomatoes, mozzarella, with fresh garlic and basil among the greens and a drizzle of balsamic reduction. Crust was hot, salad was cool. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Food and service are fantastic! Everything is fresh, thoughtfully prepared, and delicious. Only complaint is the space: nice atmosphere, but they run out of room quickly; feels a bit cramped."}
{"text":"I love Novanta!  Pizza & Caprese was incredible, the parking lot not so much.  Very pleasant dining and very friendly staff."}
{"text":"So delicious!  The menu was so exciting that it took me awhile to choose a pizza - they all looked amazing.  I had a pear, Gorgonzola & arugula white pizza and it was great.  Fresh ingredients and am amazing brick-oven crispy crust.  Loved that the owner walked around and introduced himself :)"}
{"text":"This is the closest a pizza I've had in America comes to the Italian original. And I've had Italian pizza in Italy many times. The pizzas are completely reasonably priced. Wood fired oven, perfect crispness, not too much cheese, freshly made sauce, thick high quality pepperoni. Never too many ingredients at once, never too much bread. AMAZING!  Also the dessert gelato is legit. You can even order straight up flatbread, if that's your thing. It just does not get better in terms of quality and price. I'm going to make it a point to go here every time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Visiting Madison from DC, and was lucky enough to try Novanta. Neapolitan pizza is one of my favorite foods, and Novanta's pizza is outstanding. I've eaten Neapolitan pies all over the country, and in Italy--Novanta holds its own with the best of them. The salciccia was perfect--chewy, firm, and perfectly-cooked crust; fresh and delicately-flavored mozzarella; well-portioned sauce with a balance of flavor and acidity. If you live anywhere near Novanta--consider yourself lucky--the prices are a bargain for the quality. Welcoming and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I love this place. Anytime I'm craving quick/casual Italian this is where I go. The staff are extremely friendly and always willing to answer any questions about the menu. The pizza is delicious...I've tried a few different kinds and all have been tasty (i highly recommend trying the buffalo milk mozzarella). Also, the price is so reasonable....I mean I can't complain when date night costs less than $25."}
{"text":"We've been here twice now and both times their food is outstanding. The first time we went our pizza order seemed to be taking a little longer than those around us. When they realized they lost the pizza ticket, the owner came straight to our table to apologize. The salad was delicious and when the pizzas came, they told us our next pizzas were on the house. Fresh and delicious food!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best pizza in town.  Wow.  This is what pizza SHOULD taste like.  Try the pesto pizza!"}
{"text":"Best pizza for the money. Period. So good, anytime we are in town we try and go. We've tried other pizzas but now we don't bother with anything other than the Diavola Pizza and Nutella Pizza for dessert. Great prices too!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Pizza is delicious and reasonably priced for wood fired thin crust (personally love the pesto pizza). Staff is friendly and service is fast! Truly a hidden gem in a strip mall, but worth the visit. They also have reasonably priced drinks/wine to have with your za"}
{"text":"90 seconds to delicious!  I love that I can eat this pizza without needing tons of napkins and feeling the constant need to wipe grease from my mouth! The wood fire crust is a delight.   Great place to go when you're in a hurry. If you call ahead the quoted time might be like mine tonight, a quick 5 minutes!  I have deducted a star because the toppings can be scarce. I'm not looking for loaded but I'm looking for a taste of each ingredient in each bite."}
{"text":"Great little pizza place off of Old Sauk Rd. I met a co-worker out for dinner and Novanta was her pick as she wanted to stay on the far west side of Madison. Once we got together, we started chatting away about life, and I missed taking photos of our actual food (I assure you it looked & tasted delicious)!   Novanta is run by the same owners as cafe porta alba in Hilldale Mall, and is a less formal version that serves personal sized pizzas, cooked at high temperatures.  You order at the counter and your food is served to you at your table. A limited selection of beer and wine is also available.   Seating inside is limited, however I have never had to wait for a seat. It is a great choice for take out as well.   Pros: Delicious food and buffalo mozzarella (need I say more?!), extremely friendly staff, only a very short wait for pizza since high temps are used for cooking, no reservations needed, plenty of parking.  Cons: Novanta has a little bit of a fast food feel to it, so I wouldn't necessarily recommend it as a date night spot, and they have a limited menu selection.   All in all--Definitely worth checking out if you're on the west side of Madison!"}
{"text":"Best pizza and pasta in middleton west side of Madison extremely great service everytime the pizza or past is made of  great fresh ingredients convenient reasonable fresh good food good service prompt there is nothing better than novanta take out alcohol and good love ur shit"}
{"text":"This has got to be the best pizza I have ever had! We walked in to a very friendly staff who really cares about the customers. We dined in and ordered our pizzas and salad. The service is super fast and the staff was quick to help! The atmosphere was clean and well designed. Their mozzarella and pizza sauce is to die for!! I highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by this excellent place! Came here with a group of 6 when our attempts at snagging a table at Eno Vino at 6:30 PM on a Saturday were thwarted. Ordered several different pizzas here, including the alice, toscano, salciccia, sardine (the special) and cow milk and buffalo milk from the mozzarella bar accompanied by pesto/tomatoes/balsalmic and meats.   Prices were extremely reasonable for the pizzas and they were fun to share. They were very well made thin-crust and the pizzas were flavorful -for those times you want higher quality pizza but want to be more casual than Grampa's or Naples.   The cow milk and buffalo milk was extremely fresh and tasty and worth trying at least once (though it feels like a splurge when it's the same price as a pizza and not nearly as filling). The pesto was absolutely delicious and was great to dip pizza crust into (however, the meat plate seamed to be a better deal/more filling). Definitely glad I visited!"}
{"text":"As soon as we entered into Novanta and went up to the counter we were greeted with smiles, the staff was very friendly and attentive. The pizza chef was answering questions of another patron while we were ordering, it was interesting to hear about the process of making pizza. I have to say that the pizza was good, I had the Salsiccia with sausage crumbles and mushrooms and the Diavola with spicy salami. My favorite of the two was the Salsiccia. I found the Diavola to be a tad under seasoned but when I dusted the surface with some parmesan it brought the desired level of saltiness to the pizza. I also found that the spicy salami did not bring the spiciness I wanted from the pizza. The Salsiccia was perfectly done and had  great flavor. The next day I ate the Salsiccia as leftovers heated up in the oven and it was fantastic. I look forward to coming back and trying a Panini or a salad, perhaps a white pizza. Also the pizza is done fast so no wait for Saturday lunch at 11 am."}
{"text":"Modern buildout inside with tall ceiling, exposed ductwork, black and dark red paint. Open kitchen with wood-fired brick oven in the back. Making real Neopolitan pizza isn't a secret, but Americans don't demand the real thing until recently. I'm super picky about pizza and having traveled extensively in Italy, I can confidently say that Noventa is making slam-dunk, A+ level pizza. Flavors, textures, ingredients, plating...perfect. Enthusiastic staff as well. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"New in town as early Feb, I've already found one of my favorite places to eat out in Madison - Novanta. Very good food, friendly staff and reasonable price."}
{"text":"Cheap Neapolitan style pizza with better crust than other iterations in Madison and your typical toppings. The specials are pretty inventive so keep your eye out for those. They do make their own mozza which is pretty neat"}
{"text":"There are a lot of wood fired pizza joints around here these days.  This one is pretty great."}
{"text":"Was just searching for a restaurant around the area and found this place out of the blue! The menu and pictures looked really good so a group of us decided to try out his place. We were really pleasantly surprised! They're a small store where you go to the cashier, order your pizza, and the waiter will then bring it to you. Every pizza o tried was good. I particularly enjoyed the Alice and next time I'll definitely be trying the margherita! Also had a cheese and late salad thing that was great as well. I love prosciutto and any time I can get some is worth it to me!  All in all, this was an awesome place with very reasonable prices. Reminds me of a very beloved place back on the east coast!"}
{"text":"Yes. The best pizza on the west side. Excellent prices and excellent pizza. I will continue to go out of my way for Novanta.  These are personal pies, indistinguishable from Café Porta Alba's (their Hilldale sister location is pricier) and comparable to Pizza Bruta (which is a bit drier, more floury). Some other review will say more about how they use some quick-fire 90-second oven whatever, but the result is a really balanced margherita. (Though sometimes the cheese areas are really small in a sea of red.) I'm also always so surprised to see the staff so perky and welcoming compared to other Madison-area restaurants. And I appreciate it! They appear to have a fair amount of lunch traffic and everyone sitting is always cheery. I don't get it. They must not work at the university. This is the (personal) pie to beat on the west side, at least until Sal's moves out here."}
{"text":"Really fabulous pizza. Thin crust and tasty sauce. And that mozzarella is tasty! I will definitely come again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Ordered veggetariana pizza, everything was just amazing! Great pizza place in west side"}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite quick Italian places! Everything about this place is great! My girlfriend and I got the menu explained very well! I give th pizza itself a 7/10, nothing too special but I loved the fresh mozzarella! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is great!  Seriously the best.  I know there is something special about the temperature of their oven and how their methods are only shared with a few other restaurants in the world but all I really care about is the end product!  This place has great pizza and because they cook it so quickly you can order and pick up usually within ten minutes.  I usually get the margherita pizza and have always been pleased.    The service here is also really great!  The cashiers are always smiling, polite, and add to the experience!"}
{"text":"Three and a half stars.  Fast-food-ish atmosphere (\"ambiance\"? Not exactly) -- there is a TV or two, and a serve-yourself soda machine right in the middle of the dining area. And counter service.  But the pizza is quite tasty.  And fast.  Tiramisu is somewhere between OK and good."}
{"text":"I have visited Novanta a few times now, all for takeout, and it's been a damn fine experience each time. It goes something like this:  - I peruse the menu on the wall, waffling between the fantastic salsiccia pizza (hold the mushrooms) I had last time, or one of the other dozen or so specialty pizzas listed.  - the friendly woman at the counter patiently waits - I skip the create your own option -- it's after work and my brain is fried. I don't want to think. I let the creators of these wonderful pies do the thinking for me.  - the friendly woman at the counter patiently waits - I order the diavola this time. The salame and onion and basil are fresh and cooked to perfection in novanta secondi (note: it cooks in 90 seconds; it's not ready 90 seconds after you order) - I, the friendly customer, patiently wait - I devour the pizza within 90 seconds of sitting down to eat - Magnifico!  Return next week, repeat."}
{"text":"Who said you can't find good pizza outside NY. I'm out in Wisconsin for business and thought I would give it a chance. This little place is great for lunch! They specialize in all different kinds of dishes centered around mozzarella. So naturally I went for a margherita pizza and it was fantastic. A colleague of mine had the Capri sand which and also came away with a great impression! If you are around here looking for some good Italian give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"PROS: 90-seconds-fast, cheap, delicious pizza CONS: ?  I had a custom Margherita pizza with mushrooms, and it came piping hot, crisp, and oh-so-delicious! You order at the counter and you get your pizza shortly after! The people who work at Novanta were exceptionally nice! We were in and out of the restaurant in less than 30 minutes. Five starts for a prime example of WYSIWYG!"}
{"text":"This place has nailed it! A group of 8 of us met here for lunch on a Saturday. The inside matched what you might think for a place in a strip mall with other fast-casual restaurants and we were immediately greeted.   They have a good sized menu; mozzarella bar, paninis, pizza...! Their pizza is amazing!! They have several original options or make-your-own. I had one with proscetto, mozzarella and arugula. The crust is perfectly thin with a bit of char and chew. I ended up eating the leftovers cold which I never do....so good!   I'm looking forward to going back again and again."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza done very quickly would give it 5 star but my kids weren't big fans which means a lot since we usually go out as a family pannis are good but the pizza is star friendly staff smaller pizza so each person can what they want i wish my kids liked it better so we could go more often almost always go for lunch if it's just me and hubby"}
{"text":"Super quick, super good pizza place that could not have a friendlier staff. I have never been to Porta Alba, but am very impressed with this place. All pizzas I've had were delicious and the brick oven makes them taste delectable. Small wine and beer options, but you will find something you like. Don't let the strip mall location turn you off... Soooooo good.  Just upgraded this place to a 5 based on our visit last night. The service is absolutely AMAZING. We have two small children and the way the staff interacts with them and makes ALL customers feel special is rare in many restaurants."}
{"text":"As a far west-sider, Noventa is a great spot to stop in for a quick lunch. The staff is very friendly and the pizza is delicious. The pizza is made in 90 seconds in the brick oven with a very crispy crust. I have had their mozzarella with cherry tomatoes and pesto, as well as the gorgonzola salad. All of their ingredients are super fresh, the staff is wonderful and the prices are reasonable. A great little spot to have on this side of town."}
{"text":"Came here with my coworkers and I'm really glad I did.  Love their pizzas they are absolutely to die for, the bruschetta was ok. The cannoli was great.  Only complaint was that the pizza was too thin for my liking but other then that it was stellar!!"}
{"text":"Hard to give this a 5/5 because I think my husband makes the best pizza, but this is pretty damn close!   My parents treated us and his cousin to lunch here while they were all in town visiting us as a pre-Christmas treat. My parents had the Diavola, my husband had the Regina, his cousin the Toscano, and me the Lombarda. It's hard to say which was best as they were all absolutely delicious. I have to say that the Lombarda was a refreshing change with the pears. It gave it a nicely sweet bite after eating the other pizzas. We also ordered the Foccacia and requested the olive oil/vinaigrette dip and the tomato (bruschetta?) dip. So yummy! As an appetizer we ordered the Gorgonzola salad with the olive oil/vinagrette dressing and were extremely pleased at the medley of flavors of the gorgonzola, walnuts, and cranberries. We ended  our meal with Cannoli's. My husband and his cousin said it was wonderful. I'm not a huge fan of Cannoli's, so I feel my input here should not count for this portion of the review. The portions were for single-person servings and each cut into 6 slices, which was perfect, so you could share or have one pie for yourself. We each sampled what we could (2 vegetarians in a group of 5 people and 1 pizza of 4 had meat, so you do the math). My husband, who LOVES pizza (he says that's one of food groups) got full after eating an entire pie, which, to me, says something because he can eat a lot more pizza.  Price-wise, I felt it was decent. All that food for less than $50....great! The atmosphere which relaxed and the customer-service was wonderful and friendly."}
{"text":"Great pizza and friendly service. Salads, desserts, beer, and wine also served. Fair prices. A kind employee helped us out with the menu for our first visit. The crust was amazing. Will be coming again!"}
{"text":"Normally, I'm not a pizza person. Not to say I don't enjoy pizza - it's just not often my first choice. But tonight I was just in one of those moods.  I ordered a plain Margarita Pizza, which is a good personal size at 10in, and also the House Mozzarella with the pesto, tomato, and balsamic accompaniment.  The pizza is very good. Not the best pizza I've ever tasted, but certainly up there. It's very light and not too oily. The mozz plate was delicious. The house mozz was very light and creamy, with a subtle flavor. I certainly prefer this over a strong, salty mozz.  Overall, I'd recommend this place. It's very casual and the staff are pleasant. It's also on the cheaper end."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday for some pizza and was pleasantly surprised.   Had one white and one red pizza - they are each four slices.   Good ingredients,  tasted good.   They do have wine and beer, but we didn't get it this time.   A little pricey compared to others, but a good place for Italian food in Madison."}
{"text":"Novanta is my favorite place in Madison for pizza-it tastes like you're on vacation in Italy! The ingredients are so fresh and the mozzarella is absolutely amazing. The pizzas also come out very fast even when the restaurant is busy and still taste great if you have leftovers. Nick and the rest of the Novanta crew have great service and are so helpful when we are indecisive about which pizza to order (because they all sound so good). It is clear they are passionate about what they do."}
{"text":"The food is authentic and tastes very good. I can assure you because I am Italian and moved here a few years ago. The guy that worked at the register was extremely nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Great pizza restaurant. Owner and chef really welcoming. Mozzarella salad very good and Pizza excellent. Chef put a raw egg on pizza and made it unbelievably moist. Definitely worth a visit if you are in the area. Hell, even if you are not in the area it's worth finding"}
{"text":"I ordered the Salsiccia, but replaced the mushrooms with roasted peppers.  It was exceptional. My wife ordered the Contradina with sausage.  She loved it. Nutella pizza was good, but by the time it made it to the table, it was cold...   Focaccia bread with olive oil was good, but a bit bland. It's a bit pricy for a small pizza, but you can't get 90 second pizza like this in many places.  It's well worth a look in the Madison area."}
{"text":"Enjoyed their pizza very much. Great flavor and lots of garlic. A little weak on basil and I'm sure we could have asked for more but didn't. Customer service was weak. I would expect more with only 4 occupied tables."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about this place. Love their fresh and smoked mozzarella and pizza's. I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Fantastic wood-fired brick oven pizza!  Margherita was perfect--creamy Mozzarella, fresh basil, and San Marzano tomato sauce.  The crust was  a good balance between thick and chewy and thin and crispy.  90 seconds is exactly right in that 900-degree oven.   We also had two of the Pizza Bianchi (no tomato sauce):  Pesto pizza was the perfect complement to the Margherita.  Same creamy mozzarella, but combined with sharper basil, garlic, and romano cheese flavors with bursts of cherry tomato instead of tomato sauce.  The Toscano was also good, particularly if you like garden fresh onions and peppers on your pizza.  Those toppings stood out over a base of the creamy mozzarella, garlic, and basil and bursts of cherry tomato.  Can't wait to go back and try more of the menu--they have salads, sandwiches, and nine more pizzas variations (plus build-your-own)!  Reasonably priced, casual atmosphere, and extremely delicious--a great addition to the far west side."}
{"text":"The mozzarella bar is perfection and the atmosphere is good. Service is great! The only thing is that our pizza tasted a little... Funky... Like something slipped in the crust. Overall, great place and I will definitely be coming back in the future."}
{"text":"A couple of weeks removed form the thrilling finale of the Yelp Pizza Bracket, I found myself drawn to yet another Madison-area pizzeria when my wife and I were foraging for lunch on the west side of town.  I enjoyed the pizza from Café Porta Alba during the competition, so I had high hopes for Porta Alba's more casual sibling, Novatna.  After finally tracking down a parking spot during the frenzied lunch time rush in the Old Sauk strip mall where the restaurant resides, I have to admit I was underwhelmed as I walked through the from door.  The eatery is wedged into a long narrow space, which gets progressively darker as you distance yourself from the front windows.  The interior is spartan, but clean.  The layout of the restaurant provides a vantage point to observe the cooks prepare your meal and feed the pizzas into the wood-fired oven in the open kitchen area.  As mentioned in Rebecca P, the view of the parking lot from the outdoor seating does not garner any style points.  The person at the counter takes customer orders was pleasant and asked us if we had previously dined at Novatna.  I indicated I had not, so she gave me a helpful overview of the offerings.    The food was a mixed bag.  The Classico Panini (House Mozzarella, Prosciutto,  Cherry Tomatoes, Arugula) was a let down.  Other than a more than a generous application of creamy house-made mozzarella, the sandwich was a train wreck.  The bread was surprisingly bland for a pizzeria that prides itself on its crust.  The exterior needed more time in the press, the exterior lacked the satisfying crunch needed to contrast with the soft, cheesy interior.  The biggest sin was the prosciutto element - there was a single, razor-thin slice, which contributed nothing to the flavor of the sandwich.  Also sparse were the cherry tomatoes, which were chewy and did not offer much flavor to balance out the cheese element.  Given its flaws, the sandwich was not a good value at $8.  My wife's pepperoni pizza was better than my sandwich.  The sauce was the strongest component; it highlighted the vibrant taste of quality San Marzano tomatoes, balancing the strong acidity with a high level of natural sweetness.  If mentioned earlier, the fresh mozzarella cheese provided the stringiness expected from quality cheese.  Like me bread, the crust fell short, with far too much chew and lacking the much in the way of flavor.  While the quality of the crust kicks the snot out of your standard-chain variety pizzas like Pizza Hut or Dominos, it falls short of what I experience at Grampa's or Salvatore's.   While I appreciate the fact Novatna is locally owned and operated in the chain restaurant jungle that is the West Side, I don't plan on rushing back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Really good experience. Novanta we learned means 90, meaning further that their pizza is cooked 90 seconds at 900 degrees.  Simple is always good and this is simple and good.  We are Rookies at Neapolitan pizza - stupidly added toppings to a Margherita pizza. Don't do that.  Mozzarella bar was a great addition to the meal for only 9 bucks.  Good size personal pizza - can feed two when you spilt a Mozzarella bar."}
{"text":"Certainly was delicious!  The pizza there was very good, I had the spicy pepperoni and I would definitely order it again."}
{"text":"Favorite pizza place in town. The owner Nick started at Cafe Porta Alba but he really shines with his own place. Try the Signature Novanta Pizza - it's a great mix of burrata cheese, arugula and balsamic glaze."}
{"text":"I've written several high rating reviews lately, mostly because Ive been following yelp reccomendations. I will come back here every weekend. The bright simple sauce made me question whether the tomatoes I've eaten in the past year were even tomatos!  The mozzerella was perfect, and the house pizza a balanced smoky bright mouthful. Delightful. Coffee was good too :) Talking to the owner I learned that it is VPN certified, a thing I didnt know existed! http://americas.pizzanapoletana.org/ (for everyone like me)"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised about how good this pizza was.   The crust was thin, but soft. The buffalo cheese was gooey and flavorful.  Great price for a fantastic, personal sized pizza.  Go ahead and grab a Cannoli to satisfy your sweet tooth."}
{"text":"I heard this place was good and it was. I ordered a personal sized cheese pizza with no extra toppings for $7.50. and it was good. They make it like Pizza Brutta on Monroe St, where instead of being covered with a layer of cheese it has a few dollops. Novonta pulls that off (Pizza Brutta did too). Novonta's crust was good, and the rest of the pizza was even better. I really got just a plain cheese pizza, but there was more to it. Some sort of Basil or Spinach leaves in there... I don't know but it was good. It also only took like 2 minutes to make."}
{"text":"This place is super solid. Awesome Neapolitan style pizza, paninis, salads, appetizers and desserts. Nice and cheap too. It's in my neighborhood. Go eat there, so it stays in business and I can eat there too!"}
{"text":"I stopped in on a recommendation from a friend on my way home to La Crosse on a Sunday afternoon.  I walked in and the gal behind the counter (wish i would have got her name) was extremely welcoming.  I told her a friend recommended it and I had never been here before.  She was super nice and walked me through the menu.  She suggest the most sold pizza was the Salsiccia pizza.  I ordered it and added kalamata olives.  She also suggested cannoli which i love so I picked up three of them.   She asked me my name from the get go and called me by it every time she spoke to me while I waited.  (nice touch)  Often when you go to a place on a Sunday mid afternoon you can tell the employees don't wanna be there but not here.  She was genuinely concerned that I was happy.  I was sold on the place and  hadn't taken a bite of food yet lol.  I got my food and got on my way home.  I started to eat the pizza and WOW.  What an explosion of flavor.  I loved every bite.  the fresh sauce was killer.  Then i ate the cannoli and it as good as my friends mother used to make and she was from Sicily.     I stopped to try it out and was sold just on the service.   That with the quality of food will make this a stop every time i am in town and will bring people with to introduce them to this little hidden gem.  Cannot wait to try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"We were in from out of town and looked this place up on Yelp. Read some pretty good reviews so we thought we would give it a try. Ordered two different personal size pizzas and they were both excellent. Service was very friendly and fast and helpful."}
{"text":"House sitting on the west side of town recently, I found myself searching Yelp for dinner suggestions.  When it came to Novanto you, dear yelpers, said the magic word: cannoli.  I ordered a pizza and cannoli to go.  The staff were friendly, willing to substitute ingredients, and service was fast!  Pizza was good, but not my favorite in Madison.  The crust was a bit too chewy and toppings were a little sparse though fresh tasting.  The cannoli was, as promised, delightful."}
{"text":"Novanta is a perfect example of the awesomeness of Yelp. While on a trip to Madison, Wisconsin I had a few hours to kill and was looking for some good eats. I came across Novanta and headed over here for some pizza.  It's located a little outside of the city in small cluster of other restaurants and stores. From the moment I walked in, the service was outstanding. The owner came over to introduce himself and explain how everything works. There are a list of pizza's to choose from or you can add whatever toppings you'd like. Also, the pizzas are personal size. The best part of all? All pizzas are cooked in 90 seconds due to the 900 degree wood fired oven.   I went with the margherita pizza. Once I ordered, I had a seat and a few minutes later the pizza arrived. It was thin crust, steaming hot and delicious. It was so good in fact that I ordered another one, this time with pepperoni... Even more delicious. While I was dining on both pies, the owner stopped over to get my thoughts and see if there was anything else he could do. A true gentleman.   I could not have been more impressed with this place. Delicious pizza and excellent service to go with it. Definitely a must try if in the Madison. Well worth the 15 minute Uber ride to get here."}
{"text":"Loved this place! I'm a ninja turtle, which obviously means I love pizza. So I'm always on the hunt for a new pizza place.   My boyfriend and I shared a salad, pizza, and dessert. The salad wasn't my favorite, but I did really enjoy the little slice of bread that came with it. Our vegetarian pizza was delicious. Both my boyfriend and I said we could have eaten the whole thing by ourselves. My boyfriend dug into the cannoli before I was done with my half of the pizza. I had to remind him to leave half otherwise I wouldn't have gotten a bite!   Everything was great. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This has been my favorite restaurant for the past year. I go at least once a week and the staff start putting in my order as soon as I walk in. I love the friendly atmosphere and of course, the wonderful food. I haven't had anything on the menu I didn't like. I can't say enough about how much I love this restaurant."}
{"text":"Quick update; stopped back in again recently and everything was even better than before. Really a great option on the West side!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places in town. Very authentic, with extremely fresh ingredients. My favorite is the vegetarian. The pizzas are also the perfect size for one person, so everyone can get exactly what they want. As for dessert, the Nutella stuffed pizza is AMAZING. Not to mention, the staff are always extremely friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Have to say didn't expect much in a small town in the Midwest, but from the glutinous chew and fresh milk mozzarella and simple ingredients, Novanta gives off an incredibly organic taste of home cooked pizza. We ordered the salsiccia (sausage), the diavola, and the Marsala, and I was even savoring the crust. Three pizzas for two and you don't get the infamous \"what have I done\" feeling. Prices imo reflect quality. Would definitely recommend for travelers looking for that TRUE \"healthy\" forgiving Pizza fix!"}
{"text":"Loved the pizza. Service was great and the atmosphere was enjoyable. Lots to choose from. Love the margarita pizza. They get your food out to you fast so that the pizza is still hot when you go and take a bite.  Taking leftovers home is the best part because you,will have some for the next day and who doesnt love pizza cold or hot or even the next day.  Fast, easy and really good are a great combination. And when they make their motzeralla from,scratch you know the food is going to be just as good"}
{"text":"This place is so good!  Their mozzarella is homemade and is very authentic Italian.  Whenever I visit I just get a ball of mozzarella and some bread - that's enough for me (plus leftovers) and not to mention delicious!  And when they say 90 (Novanta is 90 in Italian), they mean it!  It only takes a few minutes from ordering your food to eating it."}
{"text":"Trying something new. Was worth the trip and investigation.  They add a new twist to things.  They cook the pizza at 900 degrees for about 90 seconds--hence their name.  Just maybe my new fav."}
{"text":"Wow! What a gem and I would never have even found it were it not for helpful Yelp reviews. We had Panini with basil, tomatoes and mozzarella that was SO frickin good I have to experience that again. The cannoli was superb and the chocolate truffle gelato was Yummy! Super fast service, the friendly staff acknowledges you as soon as you come in, food was served within minutes, and the prices are not only reasonable but based on the quality of the ingredients I'd say this is an exceptional value.! We will be hanging out at this place often!"}
{"text":"Nice. Good pizza and salad, and not a big production. This is one of these fast-casual places. You order your food at the front desk and pay for it; they give you a number, which you put in the number holder on your table. Your food comes out, very quickly. As others have noted the pizzas are thin-crusted 90-second affairs, but even the salad, which tasted fresh and not premade, came out quickly.  We had the garbanzo salad and the sausage pizza, and I would recommend both. Just FYI, the salads are huge, plenty for a main dish for one or generous for two to share alongside pizza."}
{"text":"I came here with some girlfriends and I'm very pleased that we chose Novanta. I have since been back with my husband and young son.  The pizzas are great! I have sampled several of the pizzas, a couple of the mozzarella bar selections and the cannoli. The pizza and mozzarella bar items have all been outstanding! Each. And. Every. One. Seriously good stuff!!! I didn't like the cannolis but I have to preface that with the fact that I have never really enjoyed cannolis. However, my friends who are cannoli fanatics deemed Novanta's cannolis delicious.  Parking during busy times (especially lunch) can be a bit of a pain but the pizza and mozzarella bar (and I suppose the cannolis if you are into that kind of thing lol) are totally worth driving around and stalking people for their spot as they leave!"}
{"text":"I asked for mozzarella substitute in the my salad instead of blue cheese and they gladly fulfilled the request. I kept seeing folks walk in and out with pizzas so perhaps I should have ordered one. Overall happy with my food the friendly and casual service and atmosphere. I would come back on my next visit  The mozzarella was delicious!!! Like they were never refrigerated. I could probably just eat that with a little balsamic vinaigrette all day long"}
{"text":"I liked it! Novanta's menu is simple and straightforward-- they do pizza, salads, and paninis, a few options for each, all freshly made with great ingredients.  I went for lunch on a Monday and it was decently busy with only one table open in the back. I was frustrated by the menu at first because I wanted to try more than just one item, but each item is about equal to what one person would eat.  I steered clear of the panini because the menu didn't mention that it comes with a salad (it does!) and opted for the vegetariana pizza. They have a cheese plate which has their buffalo mozzarella that looked wonderful, but with pizza coming, I didn't want to overload on the cheese.  The pizza was wonderful and my lunch partner loved his panini too. My ingredients were fresh and the veggie pizza even had some of the mozzarella on it. I asked for some ranch on the side and they told me they didn't have any, only oil and vinegar. While some would be upset with that response, I liked it because it showed that they're true to their flavors (and don't mess around with junk food).  The space is simple, but not fancy, and reminded me of a typical pizza shop, although they had some cool art on the walls.  I would definitely go back, but I might get the food to go next time and the pizza is the way to go!"}
{"text":"I would love to say this is great pizza, but after my 4th visit, I have to face facts.  The concept is ideal (Neapolitan stone oven),  the choices offered are tantalizing (rosso or bianco; nice ingredient combos);  the pizzas come fast and hot - - it's a great place for a quick, tasty meal, and very good value, really.  But where Novanta misses, where it consistently lacks,  is the kind of alchemy that makes for succulence, for deliciousness, and for ultimate pizza satisfaction.  The pizzas look great, they have some nice aspects to them, but they are just not a delectable, satisfying whole, as pizzas go, and I think the main problem is a crust that is as clunky in texture as it is disharmonious in flavor.  A Neapolitan crust should blend dancingly with the toppings - - crisp here, almost sloppy soft there - - and always bright and enchanting.   But for me, the crust at Novanta is not particularly tasty on it's own - - more dark cardboard than fresh, bright wheatiness in character - - and in my last tries it has also been over-toasted, so it starts to have a flavor that is like a blend of whole wheat toast and tree bark (see attached picture).  The ingredients all look splendid,  but, again, something in the alchemy of flavors that makes for a great pizza is missing.  The mozz is excellent, the sauce is good,  but on the capricciosa the ham had little character, the peppers had an over-cooked casserole-ish sort of flavor - - and you add it all together, and flavor-wise, it just doesn't WORK.  (Though, admittedly, it can be difficult to get meats and veggies that have actual character and flavor, in the upper midwest.)    My prior pizza, a couple months back,  the salciccia also just wasn't a cohesive flavor ensemble, and the crust again killed it. (I've also had the 4-cheese twice, and once it was sublime, and the next it was unmemorable.)  Although I would love to say this is great pizza, I'm afraid it just isn't.  The concept seems right,  but there is just something missing in the flavor profile of the ingredients, and in the final execution.  Making great pizza is  an art - - and although this is high concept pizza, elaborately constructed,  it is simply missing the alchemy that makes for a succulent color/texture/ flavor bomb."}
{"text":"I showed up to Novanta in a really cranky mood and determined to hate it. Because I'm that guy.  But, I didn't hate it. I liked it. A LOT.  I had a pizza with garlic, sausage, and mushrooms, and it was AMAZE. The sauce? I would love to just ladle that into my mouth. it was so incredibly flavorful and delicious. The cheese was amazing, the sausage was broken up nicely and scattered all over the pizza--as opposed to just having giant chunks of sausage here and there. Same with the mushrooms and basil.   I was a little wary, because I read complaints about cracker-like crust, and lack of flavor, but I didn't experience that at all. Everything was great. I recommend grabbing yourself a peetza, and will definitely be back to try something else out."}
{"text":"Totally on point with good wood fired pizza!  I wish they had more of a bar selection, but of what they have....it's good.  I also love the water station."}
{"text":"I love coming here for their Bolognese pasta topped with large flakes of tasty Parmesan. The flavor is one of the best I've had ever. (Ok, thinking about their food is making me HUNGRY!)   Their pizza is also super yummy. My favorite is to Build Your Own with their spicy salami! Add one of their tasty salads, my fav is the Emiliana, and you have the perfect meal!  The staff has great customer skills - very polite and helpful. Nick and Nicole are AWESOME!!"}
{"text":"This is one of those reviews where I wish Yelp had 1/2 star options but nevertheless I'll give them the nod in the right direction because they get most of the important parts right and the place is worth a visit.  If you've been to Cafe Porta Alba in Hilldale Mall then this restaurant should be pretty familiar.  It's from the same people, the food is very similar, but this is basically the express version.  The pizzas on average are 10\" instead of 12\", but the bonus to this is that they are virtually the same size, they cost less ($8-9~ for a pie) and they have the same level of tasty quality.  That's really what's best about Novanta.  For those not familiar, Novanta and Cafe Porta Alba have a specialty oven that cooks their pizzas at 900 degrees and which was imported from Italy.  They have a rare Italian certification that only some 50 places in the U.S. have for being allowed to serve this Neopolitan Pizza.  It allows them to make your pizza in roughly 90 seconds, so wait times are fairly low for dinner (about 10-15 minutes after you order).  They use fantastic fresh ingredients with just enough choices on the menu to wet your pallet and a burnt, crispy, kneaded crust that is delicious.  It's a great portion size in my opinion; usually most people order one pizza for themselves, which gives you 4 reasonably big slices.  But since the dough is thin except at the point of the crust you will be comfortably full, not wondering why you ordered a whole pie for yourself.  As for selection, they have a few different routes you can go, the ones I described above have about 9-10 menu choices followed by another group with alternative styles (no sauce/4-cheese, deluxe salads, gelato, etc).  The Salccicia (sp) with Mushrooms, Olive Oil, Basil, Crumbled Sausage, and Garlic is incredibly good as is their plainer Margherita pizza with Bufala Mozzarella.  And if you don't like their options they do allow you to build your own.  The taste of all of the ones I've tried is light, full of flavor, with an appetizing amount of oil and crispiness that help you savor the last few bites.    The only bad marks are the location and lack of atmosphere.  While I'm appreciative that they opened this near my apartment, the bigger restaurant in Hilldale has a slightly more intimate feel and actual restaurant service as opposed to ordering at a counter.  The strip mall that Novanta is at is growing increasingly popular and has a really bad parking lot, so on occassion there's too many impatient drivers and swarms of little kids.  The decor inside is also bland, there's a few stock photos on the wall from Italy but otherwise it's very much the same as the Chipotle and Chins next door.  I'll give them time to improve this though, as they literally just opened and the cheaper price over Porta de Alba makes this a very agreeable place to frequent.  My wife and I had drinks and pizza for roughly $20 and tipped a few bucks at the counter jar as opposed to an actual waiter/waitress 20%+.  I recently had Pizza Bruta too, but both my wife and I liked Novanta and Porta Alba much better.  Not that Bruta is bad, it was decent, but it has the same atmosphere as Novanta with sub-par taste.  The pizza is definitely worth a stop for at Novanta.  Stop by ad give it a try and if you have room there's ice cream to wash it down with.  They even have a Nutella-Stuffed pizza that I'm really tempted to get next time I'm there."}
{"text":"Not sure why everyone raves about this place. The pizza was just ok, nothing special. The girl at the register gave us a 3 minute speel pretty much telling us what to order - all I wanted to know is what sizes the pizzas came in. It was annoying. We even asked for some balsamic to add to the pizza as it was so blah. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Have only ever gotten to go. Never dined in. But the pizza is just delicious. Have tried Lombarda, the Parma, and the capricciosa. And have yet to be disappointed. So glad this is just minutes from work for me. Staff is always friendly. Will keep coming back."}
{"text":"We had 4 pizzas to share and a dessert and it was pretty nice. Great place to sit outside and enjoy good Italian food. Our pizzas came pretty fast and crispy"}
{"text":"Great pizza, very unique menu. Service was good even with a restaurant full of people. They could maybe use a little more help clearing off tables during the lunch rush, but that's a minor quibble. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Sunday morning for lunch, I was hungry for some Italian flavors. I was going to cheat and go to the Asian place next door when I got there. But we went to Novanta because we prepared our minds and apptetites for something pizza-ish... the place was pretty neat and welcoming. They probably just opened because there was only one other couple but got quite busy by the the time we finished. We were greeted by the lady at the counter and when we told her this was our first time here, she walked us through the menu and what the customers best loved from the various options. The menu wasn't a puzzle but it was very easy to decide what we wanted after she explained the menu items. I decided to go with the white pizza and my husband did the red sauce one which he liked. We received our orders in under ten minutes. I got the Toscano - 4.5. It had a pleasant summery feel and taste to it. You can tell they make their mozzarella fresh. And it is pretty filling. I could eat only three slices. Half-point off for the burnt edge. Service - 5. Friendly and fast Ambience - 5. Neat with small and cozy tables. I am definitely coming back to try other pizzas and cannoli."}
{"text":"Just a short drive from my house I was excited to hear about Cafe Porta Alba Annex West opening!!!  Pizza and salads are fantastic (my pizza was actually slightly better than even the Porta Alba at Hilldale)...as I was hoping for!  The venue is underwhelming and I'm not the biggest fan of the counter order style (similar to Pizza Brutta), but the food was great.  We sat outside at their tables on a nice sunny day, but unfortunately you just overlook the parking lot.  Great service and friendly staff for sure...we will be going back!"}
{"text":"Quality pizza and great service. Novanta was a nice change from the same ol' delivery pizza that's usually available to me. Unlike other restaurants, where ordering a pizza can take ages, I thought it was great how quick Novanta is. The merit of this restaurant in its simplicity and its efficienct and friendly staff. A friendly staff member took our order at the front counter, the food was brought out to us quickly, and they even brought out the (fabulous) canoli we ordered after our entrées were done. My girlfriend and I shared a classic Margherita pizza and the Emiliana salad. Both were made with high quality ingredients and were a worthwhile size for an entrée. My critiques are that the pizza sauce was a tad too sweet for my taste and that if you order a pizza, there doesn't seem to be any opportunity to add, for example, a side salad. These thoughts are really minor however, considering the lovely meal we had at Novanta and the great service."}
{"text":"I would give this place five stars if they had a tad more seating.  However, we also arrived right after a giant group celebrating so maybe if that table is separated it might be ok.  The menu is awesome.  Pizzas are about 9 inch pies, so you can order your own to taste.  There's also sandwiches and a mozzarella bar.  The service is phenomenal- friendly and polite.  Prices are affordable and well worth it.  I ordered a Nicola, an oil and basal crust with sausage and cheese.  I love pizza, but I'm not a huge tomato fan thanks to many months of morning sickness with my oldest.  This pizza was so good.  The crust was warm, crispy and a lovely blend between a thin crust and a regular crust.  The cheese melted in my mouth and the sausage was crumbly and tangy to offset the pizza.  I honestly miss it now that I've finished it and would happily order another one if I thought I could eat a second pizza."}
