{"text":"This is by far my favorite restaurant in Blue Diamond. They just opened and and are making big waves in the local eatery scene. Cottonwood Station does things a bit differently than other places, focusing on quality ingredients and a nice relaxing atmosphere that promotes fellowship amongst friends. Whether you just finished a mountain bike ride, are out on a road bike ride, or are coming back into town after a day in Black Velvet Canyon, this place sincerely merits a stop. They specialize in small batch beverages such as lemonade, cold brew ice tea, and coffee/espresso, and their dirty chai tea can't be matched.  Their pizza, paninis, and salads are fantastic as well, and won't leave you feeling like you just blew all the gains from you latest outdoor endeavor like a greasy burger and fries would.  If you find yourself in Blue Diamond for whatever reason, stop by this place to enjoy the outdoor patio and have a drinks and snacks. You may even get lucky and see one if the local feral burros wander by."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. The food is good. Pizza has very thin crust and immense flavor. The pour over coffee is out of this world. Coffee beans are from a local roaster. Definitely come check it out."}
{"text":"Great local place with local craft beer, wine and fresh roasted local coffee. Pizza, salads, sandwiches and pastries. Beautiful patio with fire pit and views of the mountains.  Great place to get away from the city"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  The patio is awesome.  The staff is excellent.  And the food... oh my.. so wonderful!  Great place for food and a drink after a bike ride, a hike, or just to get out of the city!"}
{"text":"This NEW, VERY OUT OF THE WAY restaurant is WELL WORTH THE DRIVE!! This tiny community of locals WELCOME you with politeness, kindness & genuine warmth like your their next door neighbor.

We made the 45 minute drive and enjoyed our 3+ hour dinner. This is a casual caf√© serving breakfast, salads & lunch/dinner. We arrived Monday late afternoon for any early dinner, sat inside as it was quite HOT! (this is the desert, y'all!!) to enjoy the A/C. The patio looked very inviting with the mountain views, once the sunset it was THE PLACE TO BE!

 Lets start with the salads. The GOLDEN BEET salad is just beautiful to look at AND tasty with a balsamic glaze. If you like beets this will satisfy that craving. The ROASTED BROCCOLI Salad is outta site!!! sooooo DEEELISSSH and without raisins which really floated my boat, cuz I hate those little dried fruit things......the peanut dressing/sauce is a perfect addition plus the slivered almonds are a welcomed topper. Lastly we had the CAESAR Salad with Homemade Dressing (inc, anchovies) and Homemade croutons. Really lovely presentation - creamy dressing,  freshly grated parmesan cheese and those house made croutons! SIMPLY DEVINE.

  We ordered 3 pizzas, a margarita, a pepperoni & the fig & pancetta. Ahhh, couple things here to mention....... the MARGARITA, the red sauce is a very light tomato sauce which does provide for a fresh light taste. The PEPPERONI looked great (I don't eat sausage of any kind :**/) with small bite size pieces of the spicy sausage, again with the light tomato sauce. The FIG PANCETTA, this is kind'a their special offering. It features small (yes!) bite size pieces of sweet fig and salty pancetta with a balsamic glaze. Keep in mind there is NO SAUCE on this pizza...So it's a savory offering....

  NO cocktails, however beer & wine are featured along with soft drinks, iced tea & Italian sodas. Also many coffee options, so an iced coffee would be a very niiiiice addition with any of these lunch/dinner options, and of course with your breakfast selection too!

   Cottonwood Eatery has an on site baker, so the small bakery case displays yummy, deliciousness pastries like muffins, apple or cherry turnovers etc. again with a fresh cup of coffee to quote Ina \" the Barefoot Contessa\" Garten \"How bad can that be?\"

   The Cottonwood Eatery is the kind of place we all want in our neighborhood! On site, locally owned & staffed come on over to Blue Diamond, NV where the Population......Low,
                                       Elevation.....High
                                       & Burros......?"}
{"text":"Employees are great with such awesome personalities. Paninis and pizza rocks!!! Of course they have juices for everyone like wine, beer, beer, and more beer. I love the ambiance and the fact that this is a hub for all MTB, Road Bike, hikers and trail runners, and casual people alike. Superb!"}
{"text":"We decided to check this eatery out for Sunday lunch! It is a beautiful drive out to Blue Diamond and the cafe itself is a very nice design with a modern aesthetic and historical decor.  We all enjoyed our lunches - paninis and salads.  We started with a crumble coffee cake that was fresh with the perfect amount of sweetness and their cold brew coffee was tasty.  I will be coming back to enjoy beer or wine on the patio one evening soon!"}
{"text":"So this place is a complete an unexpected surprise. I read about it opening in the RJ journal in blue diamond and was intrigued. Blue diamond is a beautiful area but they don't have high-end eateries or coffee places as much as downtown Las Vegas.
When your first approach it it has a rustic modern architecture. The owner stated that the area had originally been occupied by a four car garage and they took the reclaimed wood from said garage and add it to the Decour of the building.
The menu is very limited. They have no full bar. But they do have local beer and wine offerings. Their pizzas and Panini's are incredible. However my favorite thing to do is to grab a cappuccino and sit out on the back patio area in the morning on the weekend.
Speaking of the back porch, it is genuinely amazing. It has Edison bulb tea lights outside and a very rustic atmosphere. They have one fire pit so if you're going to go make sure you get there before 12, or 5 PM because the locals and those that live nearby fill up the place fast!"}
{"text":"Awesome place, staff is great! Went there for breakfast, but too late, so had lunch... panini was good. All around great atmosphere. Need to go back for breakfast and dinner."}
{"text":"The best word I can think of to describe this place is authentic. From the local art to the hand crafted coffee drinks and gourmet pizzas. And the patio is an awesome place to hang out in the sun with a coffee or with friends for drinks after a mountain bike ride."}
{"text":"First visit. Hour long road bike with a detour to have  a blueberry waffle and iced americano. Tasty! Simple. Nice setting. Seems like all bicyclists today which is kind of fun. Great bike parking. 

Beautiful day. Looking forward to my next visit... definitely want to mountain bike then do pizza and beer here."}
{"text":"A pleasant surprise this morning as we discovered that Diamond City has a brand new Cafe! 
It is beautiful inside and outside and the food and service were GREAT! I had a sausage Frittata and it was delicious ...Not soggy, perfectly done ..  Kids had waffles, husband - egg sandwich... Coffee and cappuccino were outstanding! 
The atmosphere in the patio and in the restaurant was a 10, So is service...They said they are working on Umbrellas for the Patio as it quickly gets hot when full sun is out) ... Surprisingly lots of people were there, as I hope they get get enough business to maintain quality we experienced today ... We will be back!"}
{"text":"Was really anticipating the opening of Cottonwood.  Brought the family here.  The Pizza was very good, really enjoyed the fig pizza.  The coffee was excellent as well.  The patio, and decor was really well done.  Most of all really loved the atmosphere.  Parking was the only thing we struggled with.  It was terribly busy but we had a hard time finding a parking spot.   We will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"It was a beautiful morning for a drive through Red Rock Canyon NCA  and breakfast at Cottonwood Station Eatery. The parking lot was nearly full and most of the people were eating on the patio. On this day dining on the patio was fantastic with the warm sun shine.
Place your order at the counter and a server will bring it to your  table. We ordered a strawberry muffin, veggie frittata and orange juice. More strawberries in the muffin would have been welcomed. The frittata was moist and tasty. The inclusion of greens and tomatoes were a nice addition. 
One of the servers was continuously making the rounds to refill water glasses.

Cottonwood Station Eatery is a great addition to the Blue Diamond area and hopefully will benefit from the many hikers, climbers and bicycling enthusiast. We look forward to returning for lunch and dinner. Thanks Jody & Steve."}
{"text":"I just had my Birthday/Anniversary Party at Cottonwood Station and it was great! They planned the menu, and decorated a section of the patio in my favorite colors. The focaccia, and beet salad appetizers, the pizzas, and salads were delicious. They made cupcakes especially for us. Our waitress, Sarah, was amazing; gracious and efficient. This is the best party venue choice I have ever made"}
{"text":"The eatery is very well put together and comfortable. The design and decoration make this place so cute. He staff was friendly and helpful. The outside area was amazing. The view was relaxing and the shaded patio gave us a place to sit and relax. 
The food, on the other hand, was not great. I got a \"blackened broccoli salad\" which was not blackened, it was browned and soggy. My husband got a pepperoni pizza which was extremely greasy. The cheese was so strange, it had absolutely zero flavor. The pepperoni was tasty though. He whole thing was thin and soggy as well. 
It's a bummer, I was really hoping the food would be as good as the cafe looks, but not so much. I won't return soon."}
{"text":"I've now been here twice and I'm sure I will be a frequent visitor as even before it opened Blue Diamond was a frequent stop on group rides. The good, I love the atmosphere.  It's obviously bike friendly with plenty of bike parking, plenty of seating and the outdoor patio is dog friendly. The bad, the two meals I've ordered have just been okay. On my first visit I ordered the sausage frittata. It was more of a sauage muffin rather than a frittata and that's all that comes on the plate so presentation is lacking. I mean some fruit would be nice. 

My second visit was on Father's Day so I ordered the eggs benedict, which I believe may have been a special item and not on the regular menu. This was a disappointment as it was basically boiled eggs on dry muffins with hollindaise sauce.  The sauce was the only part of this meal that had anything to do with fitting the description of eggs benedict. Presentation-wise it looked great as it came with a cup of fruit and potatoes.

As far as service goes the staff is friendly but can be forgetful but I'm giving them a pass on that as they are still fairly new. I also agree with another poster about the tipping procedure if you are using your card.  25 % minimum option is not acceptable and should start at 15 % for a counter service establishment and go up from there.

I really do like Cottonwood Station and once they work out the kinks I will be happy to update my review. Until then I will order with caution because the $15 special masquerading as eggs benedict really left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"There is no view of anything but a parking lot.  Sad because it is a pretty small town.  The sign for the restaurant is almost invisible it is next door to the library which has a larger sign.  Even though this is a small place you can miss it because of the small sign which is often blocked by a parked car.  The atmosphere is lovely.  The food is fresh, too freshly cooked maybe because the wait time for service is long.  The wait person often forgets things although she is very pleasant.  All in all I would not go out of my way although the drive out is pleasant enough."}
{"text":"This place is a HUGE FIND!!! It is located in a conservation area so they cannot put signage on the road, however it is a brand new beautiful building with outdoor patio seating and fire pit. Draft beer, wine, wood fired pizza, and more. The chilled blackened broccoli with Thai peanut sauce was AWESOME. Perfect stop after hiking/biking/climbing around Red Rock. Super friendly staff and the service was great - even when we came in with about 15 people!!!"}
{"text":"This review pains me in many ways. I am not here to bash. I would really love if the owners can address the problems within their new establishment so it is successful for years to come. 

I'm a Las Vegas local and cyclist. The town of Blue Diamond is a hub of our outdoor community, and I'm there a couple times a week. I really anticipated the opening of Cottonwood. Since their opening, I have been in to eat 3 times and stopped in for a drink once.

Let me start with some positives so it is clear my intentions are good. The location of Cottonwood could not be better, and the owners have gone out of their way to be respectful of the residents of the small town they live and operate in. The building is absolutely beautiful. The quality of the work and the small details really make it shine. You can tell a lot of heart went into it. The food choices are not plentiful but are well thought out, light, and healthy. The prices are reasonable. The coffee is delicious.

Sounds great right?...then you encounter the service. The problems here are numerous. You start by ordering at one register regardless of whether you are eating, getting a latte, or a beer. Fine, no big deal if the communication between stations was up to par, however they seem to lack coordination and protocol of who retrieves what for the customer. The cashier is responsible for getting things like desserts and bottled drinks that are at the counter but they forget to give them to you or fail to deliver them to your table with your food order. The times I have ordered food, I had to give the order multiple times and make several corrections despite only ordering 3 items with no modifications. Order a nice bottle of Pellegrino with your meal? Great, so long as you have your own bottle opener with you because it is not twist off and they won't remember to open it.  Once when I inquired about a missing item, the person at the bar yelled over to the cashier that he forgot our cake rather than just apologizing and offering to get it. The time I ordered just a beer, I paid at the register and went over to the \"bar\" to be served. The woman tending bar walked away as I approached leaving only a girl who was under 21 and unable to serve me. After some confusion and running around, they had to go find someone. Finally after about 10-15 minutes, a woman finally walked out from the back and asked if I needed a beer. She seemed very put out by serving me despite I never once made a rude or impatient comment. On my most recent visit the evening of 6/2/18, my boyfriend and I ordered a salad and a pizza. It was 8pm and only about 3-4 other tables were seated. After about 20-25 mins our salad finally arrived. Another 10 minutes later a different woman came out and said they were sorry for the wait but they could only cook one pizza at a time because someone had a food allergy and they couldn't contaminate the oven. Seriously. It was probably another 10 mins...close to 45 mins total before our pizza came out. A pizza that takes about 8 minutes to cook. I don't know if their comment was true or not but we ordered and sat there for a good 30 minutes before anyone gave us a heads up about the wait. How do you basically shut down your service completely to accommodate an allergy so severe that other people's food cannot be cooked in the same oven? And on the other end, who in their right mind would chance eating out if they had an allergy that volitile? It really just sounded like a bad cover up to some other problem. The staff has not been rude in any experience, just extremely inexperienced, undertrained, or uncoordinated. 

Finally, to add insult to injury there the tipping. I think it is pretty fair to say that a tip for table service usually runs from 15% for acceptable service to 20% for good service only being more or less in exceptional circumstances. At Cottonwood Station, when you swipe your card to pay, the system allows you to add a tip. There are several options on the screen. The MINIMUM tip they have listed for COUNTER SERVICE before you have received anything is 25%. I am aware that you can hit the \"other\" button any manually punch in any amount you want but the assumption that counter service should receive a minimum of 25% is insulting, and feels like they are trying to shame customers up front into tipping more than the service is worth.

I know this was long. I hope it doesn't fall on deaf ears. I would love to come back and give a few more stars."}
{"text":"I can even begin to describe this place. Fell in love with the building the set up, great customer service, and good food!!! I will definitely be going back, this time later on at night, the design of the lights look pretty cool, it's a must!! They just open and already gets good amount of foot traffic for being so secluded."}
{"text":"Great new gem!  Beautifully design building and I appreciate the historical pictures. Not a complicated menu but very competent. Super friendly and attentive staff. Can't wait for it to cool off outside to enjoy the really nice patio and fireplace."}
{"text":"Excited to try this new place, we stopped in for lunch on our way from Pahrump to Costco in Las Vegas.  My wife had a bacon and cheese sandwich and I had a chicken breast with garnishments, both on7 grain bread.  The sandwiches come with a fresh side salad, which was good. The Chi Teas had way too much ice and not enough tea. The service and ambience of the place are good, including the old Ford F5 stakebed truck backed up to the patio and the historical pictures displayed around. This is a great place for mountain bikers, bikers, and tourists to stop in for some food and refreshments."}
{"text":"Driving though Red Rock we found this great place to stop.  Great coffee and pastries, everyone was nice and did not have a wait.  Very friendly environment, would suggest you stop on the trip through."}
{"text":"Huge patio, adorable decor, friendly staff, and healthy good food. Excellent stop for The cyclists and MTB that pass through."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great food, beer, snacks, coffee in an actual cup. Sitting out on the patio enjoying a pizza and beer surrounded by the mountains is amazing. The people that work here genuinely care about taking care of you, too. Highly recommend! By the way...just order the bread pudding. Just do it."}
{"text":"Second visit was fantastic. Heard both Mazzy Star and Cowboy Junkies playing on the speakers. Perfect. Portions a little tiny for the cost so plan your visit more as a light meal or snack. Friendly staff and great music will keep me coming back."}
{"text":"This place is really cute! We ordered a pizza and it was very good. I ordered an Italian cream soda, and it was okay, I wouldn't order it again though. Overall it's a great place with friendly service."}
{"text":"This place is a breath of fresh air.
As a 24 year resident of Las Vegas I really appreciate being able to take a short scenic drive, then be in a totally unique environment. How refreshing!
The coffee  is some of the best I've tasted, and the menu appetizing.
A \"definitely recommend\" if you want a relaxing change of pace close to home, but a world away."}
{"text":"A must place to go to get away for Las. Vegas. The food is amazing and the beers compliment the food. So relaxing and green out here."}
{"text":"We had just left a \"Sip and See\" gathering for my nephew's 8-month old daughter. My wife said \"Hey, let's try that new place in Blue Diamond.\"
So, off we went. I'm glad we did. We sat inside. My wife had a Great Basin beer - hoppy she said. I had a red wine pulled from a tap, chilled. Very nice. A margherita pizza topped off the day and what a great pizza it was! Extra-thin crust. Yummy red sauce. Nice slices of melted mozzarella and shredded fresh basil. And, there were slices of tomato on the pizza too. We looked over the menu and decided to go back soon for breakfast."}
{"text":"Quaint new place in Blue Diamond.  Staff was friendly and welcoming.  Our pancetta, fig, balsamic pizza was a good snack with our frosty cold beer. We dig the different textures of the wood vs metal vs concrete decor. We will back soon."}
{"text":"New and very nice!
I finally had a chance to stop and check out Cottonwood Station inBlue Diamond this morning as a pitstop on a training ride.  Open for about 2 months now, this is the perfect place for cyclists, hikers, and those out for a scenic drive to drop by for coffee, tea, pastries, a beer, and much more.  The design of the place has gotten a lot of love and there's indoor and outdoor seating.  Order at the counter and then find a place to sit. I had an iced tea and waffle bites and my friend had a blueberry scone and iced cold brew.  Coffee is from local roasters Desert Wind so you already know that's a plus. Service was fabulous; our order was brought out to us on the patio.  There are a couple of clean unisex bathrooms which is very much appreciated when you're out and about on your bike.  There were quite a few cyclists here as it's convenient to get in and out of the eatery plus there's a bike rack out front to park your wheels.  If you look for the little details in the design, you'll see bike parts used in the patio as well as a wind chime--love it!  
Breakfast, lunch, dinner, and drinks are all available here and I look forward to stopping here often.  

6:00am-8:00pm, Sun-Thurs
6:00am-10:00pm Fri-Sat"}
{"text":"Great getaway from Las Vegas. If you a resident of Mountains Edge then this place is a must do. Gorgeous structure architecture. Squeaky clean facilities! Great menu selection! Pizza are on the smaller side but the panini sandwiches are well crafted and a home rum! I had the pesto chicken sandwich with a great cider beer and finished off with a Carmel cheesecake! 

The wait staff is young and new so be patient. The outside patio is breathtaking awesome loved how they converted a pickup truck backed up to the building into a table for six! 

Iced coffee and fresh ground coffee fills the air great design accents of modern wood and rusted metal make this establishment a standout! Can't wait to come back for a sunset sip and soak in this magical place again.

I would recommend a few more tables on the inside. Candles or a fly strip near the doors. And keep the young waitresses on their toes about follow up and service they will help the flow easier.!"}
{"text":"Great pizza for sure. That is all i've had so far. I am a local and appreciate being able to have this place to eat with the nice and relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"This might be my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. The coffee and treats are good, the pizza is good, and the patio seating is amazing! Great place to go with friends for a casual meal."}
