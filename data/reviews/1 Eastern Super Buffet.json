{"text":"very good food, the person that said the place was just plain disgusting must be the competition.  They have \"prime rib\" on the buffet, now i'm not sure if this is actually prime rib but if it is its the toughest piece of meat i've ever had, that is my only compliant...everything else is wonderful and a huge selection, one thing I would suggest is making sure the labels above the food match what is in the tray  Watch out in the winter time the snowbirds flock to this place and you will usually have a wait at least on friday's and saturday's"}
{"text":"We enjoyed the food and will return. The restaurant needs some updating and a good cleaning. They were busy enough when we were there, so the buffet items were fresh."}
{"text":"Looks like our favorite buffet is now closed down. Showed up tonight and it was shuttered."}
{"text":"I am not ordinarily a fan of Chinese buffets..but wow.. this one breaks the mold !! The best ever, I've been to. Everything freshly prepared and served hot because of the popularity of this place. They have huge turnover but rarely do you have to wait for a table. Imagine all you can eat seafood.. crab legs, shrimp prepared in maybe 5 different ways, many unbreaded and stir fried with crunchy veges, shellfish of every type, a sushi bar as well, and Mongolian grill, where you can load up your own plate and have it stir fried while you wait. Really a treat and I highly recommend you give it a try."}
{"text":"WIth Sashimi and Crab legs served, the Eastern Super Buffet worth the money you pay.  Sushi...Checked Mongolia BBQ...Checked Raw calm...Checked Shrimp....Checked  Dessert & Ice Cream...Checked  Just a little far from Gilbert where I live. :P"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try because of all the decent reviews. I was very disappointed by pretty much every item. A lot of the dishes were cold and bland. The Mongolian grill section was just as bad. Almost no flavor at all. The service was subpar also. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I would say this place is pretty good.  All I had was crab legs, few shrimps, green tea ice cream and sweet and sour soup.   Overall price and quality was good. Service was nice and very kind.  I would go back for just crab legs. ($14)  my man said their chickens are all good. Sweet and sour, orange and some BBQ ones."}
{"text":"The food is always fresh. Sue is great. We eat here at least twice a month, but often times more than that. The variety is wide enough for almost any taste. Sushi, salad, fried foods, traditional favorites, crab, not to mention the Mongolian Grill. Prices are reasonable. It usually runs around $25-$27 for the two of us."}
{"text":"This was from a year ago I picked this restaurant because they had crab legs and prime rib we went in at 9 they quickly ran out I complained that they were still open till 11 and then they were out and the waitress had a bad attitude and you should you complain too much I'll never go back the food was cold snotty waitresses and triple battered shrimp who wants to eat 5 pounds of flour and grease"}
{"text":"GROSS!  Today I had a roach on the rim of my cup of soda, The waitress said \"Oh\" and got me a refill never did she appoligise for the gross situation. As I approched her and said check please and keeping my cool she still charged our order. I let the manager know about the dead roach in my drink they wanted to pay me back what I was charged, I just told them it's not about the money it's about accountability..........."}
{"text":"Omg! I hardly ever write reviews but this place was fantastic!  It's going to be our new favorite Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Definately very good. food are fresh, selection good, priced resonablly. Among one of the best Oriental buffet I've seen."}
{"text":"The best buffet in the east valley, if you consider this still the east valley and not Florence West!  Still it is well worth the drive.  I love their Coconut Shrimp, Hot and Sour soup and most everything else, it is a buffet so liking everything is not a problem, there are many great items to chose from.  As my mother used to say, try a little bit to see if you like it first."}
{"text":"This buffet is pretty good!  All sorts of items available in the buffet, and very fresh, not stuff that has been sitting all day, as seen at most buffets.  I learned of this place when coming out of LA Fitness, the smell is delicious from the street, and better when you experience the offerings.  Lots of space here, great for large groups, as well as small tables of 2."}
{"text":"They just opened an American Chinese food restaurant in China. Most probably they learn from the one in Mesa. This is the standard to which all Chinese restaurants should be measured. Freshly made food of all varieties. And there is no limit to how much you drink. Next time you have to cook at home you're better off driving to number one Easterm super buffet."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here whenever we are on this side of town. Not only are the prices reasonable for a buffet, but they have various choices. They have a things from Steam ShuMai to Sushi to the Mongolian Grill (where you pick what you want to be grilled up and they put it together for you.  The staff is not too bad, too. They refill your drinks and collect your plates at timely manners.  So, if you are hungry and on this side of town, you should check out this place."}
{"text":"This buffet is pretty amazing. So amazing that we drive over 20 minutes and come with a game plan on how to eat more than 4 plates of food. Eastern buffet has all the basic chinese favorites plus sushi and a stir fry  station. Prices aren't bad and service is friendly. So bring your appetite and your stretchy pants and have a great time stuffing your face!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in the valley! They have the best food, the biggest selection and the greatest service. I don't think I have ever had to ask for a drink refill in all my times at their establishment. My family and I have a monthly tradition of visiting ESB and without regret! They are friendly, courteous and on point. We always leave a great tip, and for a reason."}
{"text":"Terrible! My daughter and two of her friends ate here yesterday and got food poisoning!"}
{"text":"Awesome service, great food, I always get the crab legs and sushi, the honey walnut shrimp is very good also. Get there early for dinner, cause all the tables are full, even during the week. Servers very fast the refill your drinks and take away your finished plates. Will be coming back again. Don't know why there are 1 star reviews on here. Have never had a bad experience at this buffet."}
{"text":"For a buffet they have a great selection and a lot of choices for food. Some items are better than others to be expected. I really like their sushi and the Mongolian BBQ station. Had some amazing dumplings and dim sum, however the prime rib was really dry and could not locate a knife through out the entire restaurant. The crab legs are a big hit. The crowd tonight was the 55+ snow birds and the place was pretty crowded, for a good price, i believe dinner was $12.50 I will be returning. A good place for kids too lots of choices from traditional to American. Also they have ice cream and soft serve."}
{"text":"Been here before several times. Did it's usual ok. Came tonight, (don't come for dinner). It's like the whole state of Minnesota is here. The food didn't taste that great this time either. Sushi rice was dry. Tea tasted like water. Not happy."}
{"text":"Was in the area today and decided to give this place a try.    I love Chinese food and thus am pretty tolerant of even mediocre versions of it (I draw the line at Panda Express--horrible!).  I also enter these buffets with moderate expectations, since the emphasis is typically on quantity and variety over quality.    The decor and layout are very nice.  The selection here is good.  And the service was friendly and efficient.     That's it for the positives.  This was some of the worst Chinese cuisine I've had in quite a while.  The Won Ton soup was bland.  There was no beef and broccoli (one of my favorites), so I separated some beef from the pepper steak and also tried the chicken and broccoli.  Usually only white meat chicken is used with the dish, but here it was difficult to tell.  Like the soup, these samplings were also very bland and not of particularly good quality.    Even the sweet and sour sauce just wasn't very good.  Same for the string beans.  The sweet and sour shrimp was probably the best tasting food of all that I tried.  (Note: I do not like crab nor sushi, so obviously didn't try any of that.  I notice that most of the positive reviews here focus on those selections, so perhaps they're better than the other fare)  Overall I was very disappointed and regrettably I have to rate this place 2 stars (and that's being quite generous).  Pretty bad even by buffet standards."}
{"text":"Ate here early Sunday morning and once I sat down I had experienced the worst smell in my life. I had realized my table was near the bathrooms and there was a very obvious sewage problem going on in there. I had lost my appetite and will never go back again."}
{"text":"This, unfortunately is going to be a negative review. I had only been here once and i do not plan on returning due to my experience that i had. Let me explain. The day started with me and my roommate looking for something to eat. We were super hungry and there were many choices in the area, Signal Butte and Baseline, as some people may know. In the end, we ended up deciding to go the buffet since we were starving. We also didn't have much money at the time so we also wanted to check the price to see if it was fair. So we stroll in, they day happened to be a Sunday unfortunately, you will understand why i say it's unfortunate in a second. So we go inside and look for the menu for pricing. After looking around at all the walls like goofs for a good minute or so and not being able to the menu we decide to ask the hostess for the price of \"2 adults\". Notice the quotation marks? Without even looking at us she said in a rude voice that made it seem that we interrupting her from just standing. \"13.some dollars !\" ( cannot recall the exact price). After some quick math, and calculating the tax in, we concluded that 7 dollars each was a fair price. After being seated we soon recognized that we were the first customers of the day. The location had just opened for the day and we were going to be the first people to eat the \"fresh\" food. After being seated and asked what we would like to drink we went into the lines. After filling my plate and taking my seat I took my first bite of food. I'd say the temperature was between cold and room temperature. As a teenager who was still starving though i was able to finish my plate even though it had become highly unappetizing. I had really expected the food to be hot and steaming since they had just opened but boy was I wrong. After that first plate i stood up and went to go see what i should get this time, what i noticed was a lot of sea food, which is not necessarily bad besides the fact that i was highly allergic to shellfish. So no crab legs, shrimp, and those sushi rolls for this guy!  So after walking around the buffet for a bit i ended up getting the same thing as my first plate but smaller because i was still concerned by them temperature of the food. Luckily this time my food was just under room temperature, which happened to be an improvement. However I started feeling queasy and my appetite had disappeared. I was really upset because normally I'm the type of guy that would like 8 plates worth of food, but that day was just 1.5 plates. The waiter was nice but even his niceness could not fix how i felt about the place. So i just sat for a bit after finishing my half plate thinking if i was going to get more because you know buffets ain't cheap but i could not stomach the food and I had already began feeling sick. So we get the check and BOOM! 28$+!!!!  I seriously did a double take. Thinking the price could not have been correct and there must have been an error i look at my receipt and there it said \"13.?? per adult\"  had i known it would going to be that much i would have ordered 10 burgers from In-n-Out! I understand that it is not so much but sincerely felt that i had been cheated.   So we look again for the menu hoping to find the answers to our questions and we finally found it. It was in such a bad location it was no wonder we could not find it before. The reason why it was priced like it were Mother's day dinner time was that they were serving unlimited crab legs that day... -_-...The thing I could not eat or else i would die made the price 2x the amount i originally thought it was. So i basically wasted 30 dollars on food that was cold, dry, and possibly dangerous. Next time I feel like going to this buffet, I am going to punch myself in the face and drive to Olive Garden and spend less money on 10x better food. Have a good day."}
{"text":"If you are hoping to go here for the \"dish to die for\" this is not the place. This is, after all, a Chinese Buffet.   But it does offer the one thing I am always looking for when I go to a buffet, the ability to get FULL.   They have a very good variety of dishes. Including a Sushi Bar. Now, being a big fan of Sushi, I have not tried this. Something about sushi at a Chinese Buffet just does not mix. But the rolls looked fresh..    In addition to the many varieties of dishes, they also have a Mongolian BBQ. Nice selection of items to add. It is not a full Mongolian BBQ, but is a nice addition to the already large selection of food.   Also have a nice little dessert bar with some limited offerings. The nice topper to a pretty good value lunch/dinner.   $10.00 including drink and meal. Couple of bucks for a tip. Out the door for $12.00. A pretty good value and good food. Better than the $12.00 burger/fry at Five Guys!!! (See other reviews.)   If you are in East Mesa, give it a try. Just south of the 60 on Signal Butte.   While you are there, drop your car off at the car wash next door. That review for a later time.."}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN! We went at 8:30 on a Friday night. We were seated & drinks were filled once. They said they were closing at 10, however they were too busy closing to run the restaurant. The food was cold & old. No new food was placed out while we were there. The person who was supposed to be our \"server\" was eating ice cream & the \"hostess\" was eating at her station, so we bussed our own table. While at the buffet, an annoying employee was trying to get me to eat the last of several differ dishes, I assume so she had less to clean up. What a waste of time & money. Thumbs down. Negative 5 stars. Don't eat there!!! In n' out is in the same parking lot!!! Just sayin."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with Rand H. and it was really good. I started with the hot and sour soup which was second to none.After that i ate a seafood plate containing coconut shrimp,fried shrimp, steamed sole.fried fish,stuffed crab shell and baked salmon all were very good but the salmon was on the dry side.Next plate had some excellent chicken wings a little 2 inch mini pizza(so so),steamed mussels and cheese,green beans, mushrooms and teriyaki chicken once again all were very good. then on to desert , well the chinese donuts were perfect not crunchy on the bottom at all. the rest were all your regular Chinese buffet sweets.Everything i ate here was real good and the service is great not much more you could ask for five stars.                            i"}
{"text":"I am usually not a fan of chinese buffets but this one is very good. The food is always fresh and the place is always clean. Great selection of sushi, love the crab wontons, and they have this crab that is smothered in cheese, yummy! They also have a mongolian section, lots of desserts, good little salad bar, overall a really great buffet."}
{"text":"Dinner.   Food was cold, bland. Dessert tapioca tasted chalky. Was not worth the price.  Will not go back."}
{"text":"Very good food and organized service. They also serve beer, wine, ect. The only problem is that their deserts are awful and the ice cream scoops sitting in dirty water is really gross. If they get some cheesecake or something, this would be the ultimate buffet."}
{"text":"Would have given 3 stars but my husband saw a bug (not a flying insect) crawling on the desserts. He didn't tell me until we were in the car. Sweet of him, right? While I understand that bugs happen on occasion, it changed our overall impression. We came at 1 PM on a Tuesday and were seated right away at a far table in the small dining room. The rooms is small and decor is dated but it serves it's purpose. The table was sticky, dirty trash under the soy sauce dispenser on the table and the poor server was the only person for all of the tables and looked very overwhelmed. We did have to wait awhile for drink refills and our check but she was super sweet and it's not her fault that they were understaffed. Price was really affordable at about $8.50 per adult and our 2-year-old was free.   We thought that coming at a prime lunch time would mean fresh food, but not so much. Here is the good and bad:  Bad: Fried zuchini (soggy, cold breading) Fried scallops (soggy, cold breading) Crab Rangoon (the flimsy dough with no crunch or texture, cold, and no taste to filling Veggie Egg Roll (cold and mushy) Pizza (cold, soggy and undercooked)  Banana pudding (odd, artificial and metallic flavor) Ice cream (scooped individually in plastic cups in a deep freeze. Frostbitten and overly hard) Fried rice (undercooked rice and no flavor) Orange chicken (extremely tough, over cooked meat)   Good: S&S chicken-great white meat and warm sauce Some sushi (California and Philly were the freshest of the bunch) Meat egg roll Fruit selection (most was canned but a few healthy gems) Steamed white rice Coconut shrimp Green beans   While their were a few tasty items, we won't be back due to primarily non-fresh food and the appearance of Mr. Creepy Crawly. Not enough making this place stand out from competition."}
{"text":"Hair in my food? Gross. The waitress acted like she didn't see the black hair in my lo mein so I pointed it out and she discounted $2 off of my receipt. Even so, never again. I don't trust their food/service."}
{"text":"I'm not going to waste too much time critiquing a buffet.  This places satiates your hunger.  It tastes good, there's a vast variety of options, and it's at a good price.  Whats not to like?"}
{"text":"I remember coming here years ago and loving almost every dish they served. These days, the quality of the food has dramatically dropped. For starters, they use red onion in everything now! I don't mind onion, I love the stuff, but when there are more onions than noodles in my chow mein, I become a little testy.   Secondly, they used to serve these wonderful Asian style beef ribs that were amazing. It seems that been replaced by a similar looking pork dish that falls very short in the flavor department. The sushi is definitely made fresh but it's pretty bland. The coconut shrimp is a bit sweet but still pretty tasty and I like the egg drop soup, but that's pretty much it.   I really am disappointed because this used to be my go-to place for quick, delicious Chinese food but not anymore. I won't be coming back anytime soon. :("}
{"text":"I was on Yelp looking for some good places to eat , someplace with good reviews.    And I ran across this place.  Now, it was quite a ways to drive, but I figured, what the heck.  It was, without a doubt, the best Chinese Buffet I have ever been to.  The food is fresh and cooked just right.  The sushi bar is really good and fresh.  The fresh fruit is pentiful and fresh.  Even the baked steamed fish is good.  I am a big crab puff person, and the amount of filling in these was amazing.  I will go back to this place over and over again.  Anyone reading this, it's worth the drive!"}
{"text":"food was soggy and stale.  I've had worse before but this is definately bad."}
{"text":"I have been to this place before and have had an average experience here. Food is ok. Very Americanized flavors and since its a Buffett the food taste like it has been sitting.  However today on Christmas decided to give it a try again since no other place around was open. We walked in to a smell of different foods,old fish and something else. I just about turned around but my husband had his heart set. Got a few items sushi, crab was not cracked, prime tub was tough and you had to cut it yourself. However, once we got back to our table it smelled so bad. I tried to eat my food but the smell of sewer was so overwhelming  I just wanted to get out of there. The staff is nice and friendly, however there is an obvious issue with cleanliness. I will never return."}
{"text":"Best to remember that this is not high end cuisine.  It is low cost, high protein, ready to eat when you walk in buffet.  It offers plenty of options, soups, salads, fruit, fried foods, desserts, hot Chinese and cold sushi.  The problem with having so many options is that it is nearly impossible to keep everything fresh.  That's the trade off.  Plenty of items look like they might have been there for a while.  I would recommend finding a seat that overlooks the serving area and then watching where the fresh dishes are being deposited to find the better options.  Normally a sushi fan and considering the type of restaurant I was in, I just didn't have the guts to try anything from the large sushi offerings.  I actually was more interested in trying the Mongolian BBQ, a hard to find fare in the East Valley.  Again, freshness being the major challenge, I was hoping to skirt the issue since Mongolian BBQ is like a salad bar of veggies and meats that are cooked to order.  Sadly, it was hard to judge the freshness of the BBQ since most of the veggies were bathed in ice.  It was a bit difficult getting the veggies on your plate without adding the ice.  However, picking out the celery from the ice was child's play compared to the meat section.  The meats were frozen blocks of bricks with only grilling tongs as a tool to break them apart.  Thankfully, the grill chef took pity on me and broke off a few meat chucks, saving me from losing face or tearing a bicep.  The chef did a good job of ensuring everything was cooked, but unlike most Mongolian BBQs, the food is cooked on a standard café griddle where every other fried food is prepared.  As a result, my Mongolian BBQ lacked a fresh flavor.  Al-in-all, I think it is unfair to judge Eastern Super Buffet too harshly.  They are not about freshly cooked Chinese food to order.  If you want your food fast, your bill inexpensive and your veggies easier to chew, you'll do fine here.  Did like the shumai..."}
{"text":"No question about it, this is hands down the best Chinese buffet in the state of Arizona. When we visit family in the area, we always have dinner here two or three times. The selection is excellent, everythng is hot and delicious, and the service is great.   If you go here during the winter, expect crowds of snowbirds, but we have never had to wait more than a few minutes."}
{"text":"Decent food, I'm not a huge fan of buffets but I had a lunch date with my mom and she was in the mood for Asian so we tried it out, it was decent, nothing fantastic, Pretty standard and typical Chinese buffet food.."}
{"text":"Yuck is all I can say. The food looked like it was all dried up an then to top it off I found a huge black hair in my noodles. Worst buffet I have ever been to!"}
{"text":"My family and I eat here often. I've never noticed any problems with cleanliness or smell as is written in some of the other reviews.  Most times that I've been there, there is someone making fresh sushi, which is nice. Hot and sour soup is pretty good too."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of buffets in general.  Every now and then I'll find a decent one.  This place got couple things right - it's in the East, it's a Super Buffet, but I think they exaggerated on the #1 part.  Needless to say I wasn't too impress.  Food was for sustenance, aside from that I think it definitely needs improvement.  I enjoy their concept of integrated the sushi bar in a buffet setting.  Why do all Asians go to Chinese Buffets? Crab Legs, my friends - yes Deadliest Catch is probably every Asian persons favorite show.  However the crab legs here were too soggy and salty - needs to be steamed and cleaned out better.  Though I did enjoy their fresh oysters, but then I can only stomach about 3 total."}
{"text":"I loved my favorite (divey) Chinese buffet in Chicago and  after reading all the great reviews of this place, I convinced Lynn W and Claire to drive all the wayyyyyyy out to BFE to try this place.  I had a hard time finding it in the large strip mall - it's to the left of LA Fitness on the side, behind In n Out and the car wash -   As soon as you walk in you can see the islands and trays of food and I was happy to see how clean everything was.  We were seated, our waitress took our drink orders and we headed to the food. I tried a little bit of a lot of things -   A lot of the appetizers were greasy and the crab ragoon was made with that fake crab and was ick.  The beef and broccoli was tasty as was the mongolian beef, although the ratio of veggies to beef seemed 4-1 in favor of the veggies.  For lunch they had a huge bowl of peel and eat shrimp that were just okay, a few of them were a little mushy and not tasting very fresh.  They do have a small sushi bar, but I don't do sushi and I didn't have anything from the Mongolian BBQ.  Overall the food was just okay, the place was very clean, and the waitress kept our drinks filled.  Not sure I'd go back here again, there are other Chinese buffets in the area I'll have to try instead."}
{"text":"I am from Indiana and have been in AZ for about 3 mo. and was wanting to find a good Chinese Buffet so I looked online and found this one.   Decided to give it a try on a Sunday after church.  I was there about 1:30 or so and it was still very busy.  As far as the food goes there were many, many choices.  The buffet was kept full and the items were hot enough.  As for flavor most of the entrees were reasonably good, for a buffet.  I believe you always get more flavor when you order off a menu.  The soups, crab ragoons, egg rolls and such were very tasty.  Really there wasn't much, if anything, that this place didn't have including lots of seafood such as crab legs and so on.   There is also a large fresh made sushi bar area and a hibachi grill where you choose your own raw foods and they cook it to your taste.  Cleanliness was pretty much the same as in most Chinese restaurants.  The chair bases were sticky to the touch, but I've never been in one where they weren't.  Restrooms needed paper.  All in all this was a pretty good dining experience, and I got my chinese fix.  I would go back to this place again sometime.  Prices were a little higher on the weekend.  I paid $13.58 plus tax but I don't think it is overpriced considering how much they have."}
{"text":"I hate Chinese food, generally speaking. All Chinese food has been suspect in my eyes for years. I could never tell what I was eating!  It all tasted the same!  Greasy and oily and fishy.   This place, however. This place is a different story. First of all, the place smelled clean. And looked clean. Secondly, the employees spoke English clearly and were polite and courteous. Great servers kept my beverage full the entire time without my requesting it!  Thirdly, the buffet was a visual feast for the eyes!  There was a gorgeous array of sushi for those who like that sort of thing.  There were soups, sauces, delicate rice noodles, chow mien, stuffed crab and other seafood like mussels and octopus. There were a variety of chicken dishes, my favorites were the Peking chicken and the bourbon chicken. Yum!  Sesame rolls and a variety of sweet desserts!  Sorbet is small servings, great for pallet cleansing or just a sweet treat!  There was fresh fruit and more, and that is only the buffet tables I was able to visit!  There were several others on offer.  And all dishes were clearly and accurately labeled.   The food was deliciously prepared and presented. The counters were cleaner than any buffet I have been to in the past. The food had distinct from each other flavors, and were yummy!  Cost was typical of a buffet. We went at 1:30 in the afternoon. Two adults with two drinks was $22, essentially $11/person. Not too bad, and a nice change from the usual fare.  My only gripe I have is that it isn't closer to my house!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are from Wyo. I was really disappointed in a few things at this place. All the should be warm/hot foods were cold and dry. The soup and sushi was ok. Had better."}
{"text":"As far as the proverbial Chinese buffet goes, this one is great. Actually #1 Eastern Buffet, there are a great amount of selections here. Those of you who have read any of my other area reviews know that my recommendation is to come sans snowbirds.   I like that there are fruit and salad bar, soup, entrees, sushi and dessert, as well as Mongolian BBQ. Something for everyone.  This is my first review of many visits.  I was not super impressed with today's fare.  Though I was there early, it didn't seem fresh. My egg drop soup was thick and lukewarm. The fries scallops were rubbery and hard to chew. The coconut shrimp was hot and tasty. The green beans were in an interesting brown gravy. Not healthy looking but tasted ok. The fruits were strange, and disintegrated when I cut into them. Maybe stored in syrup too long?  The staff is always courteous and attentive.  I will return, in hopes that it was a fluke thing."}
{"text":"This place will make you go to bathroom for days after!! Bring plenty of bip to bis when you go here, stay away from seafood!!"}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food buffet in the East Valley... Period...    The key to this buffet is to go when it is busy.  That way there is always good turnover on the food.  On slow nights because of the amounts of dishes food can get stale.  There is a lot of seafood on the buffet lines.  Snow crab, butter clams, peel and eat shrimp can always be found for dinner.   As far as the Chinese dishes the coconut shrimp is fantastic.  Other dishes are as good as you would expect in a reasonably priced buffet.  There are about 40 in all and cover the usual range of proteins from Chinese food as well as rice and noodles. Service is always in a hurry moves around a lot of tables.  Enough American food to keep the family happy as well.  Sushi and a Mongolian Wok are also available.  For desert the choices are limited but the green tea ice cream is worth a try.  Overall a real consistent solid meal every time."}
{"text":"I could have given this buffet a five star rating except for the service.  Our waitress was very intent to have us finish up and get out.   The food was very good especially the coconut shrimp.  The price is great."}
{"text":"I don't even like buffets but I must say, this one is really good!  We sometimes order the sushi to go which is always good as well.  The inside needs updating but other than that, good food!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for when I need an unlimited supply of Chinese food. Great selection, great food and they never let your glass go empty. They are quick to clean up the table so you have enough room. Nice and courteous. The best part is, they always make sure there is not an empty tray of food. Just writing this makes me want to go back!!!"}
{"text":"sure this place has decent food,  but i have to say its crammed in there and to tell you the truth, i dont like to listen to other peoples conversation  much less smell their freaking perfume. the selection was small and the bill higher than expected. probably will not return. in my list of buffet's this ranks in at 5"}
{"text":"This place is nasty! Apparently the reviews are old or their employees are writing them.  Food was cold and the place just looks dirty."}
{"text":"Don't have enough good things to say about this place.  We don't like Chinese buffets normally because many times food has set too long.  This place was amazing!  Everything was hot, fresh and tasty.  We've only been once and that was on a Friday night.  We pigged out on clams, crab legs and shrimp and so many other good items.  All I can say is FANTASTIC.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"It seems lately the food has been hotter.  Over the months I've complained about it too. I've been here about ten times now and have to say it is consistently good."}
{"text":"4 stars for the service, 2 stars for the food  I joined my aunt and her in-laws here for dinner over the weekend and it is pretty much your average Chinese Buffet. We were seated right away and got up to look at our food selections. I started with a bowl of hot and sour soup and some wontons and egg rolls, all of which were pretty unforgettable. Second round I had some orange chicken, bourbon chicken, and fried rice. Again, standard fare. Last trip I grabbed some sweets; chinese fried donuts and a slice of cake. The chinese fried donuts were probably the best thing I had that evening. My guests chowed down on crab legs which they enjoyed - but I wasn't in the seafood mood so I didn't have any. The service was great though - my water glass was never full and our server was glad to grab us items we may have forgotten before we sat down. Personally, I wouldn't come back but it is a pretty popular spot."}
{"text":"Plenty parking in same plaza as In N Out and LA Fitness. Good for groups. Offers Mongolian BBQ (u choose ingredients), Chinese entrees, sushi (sashimi tasted ok...not that fresh), crab legs (pretty fresh), fruits, a variety of ice cream.  I don't go to buffets often. This one was pretty good for a buffet."}
{"text":"They need to do a better job of keeping the food hot. Most of what I ate was tasty but there were some things that I got that looked like it would taste good but when I tried them, they were cold so I didn't eat them."}
{"text":"Our favorite place to go. Went here for dinner for the first time.  Great food!! Oysters in the half shell? I had no problem trying them and they were delicious.  We recommend this place to anyone who loves chinese buffet."}
{"text":"If one would like an all you can eat buffet style of food and based around all kindas of different ways you can eat and have the able to as if you would treavel around the world, as they have a right as you ask/pick out the kinda fixings, they will cook you an omelet as if that is what it is as it is hot, made to order and we'll that is something you might just bring you to having a new family night place to eat out; it's in the means of something super fresh hot and ready too them having sushi, that is fresh and uncooked.   Over all, I like going their as they are friendly and very nice means of being able to sit and enjoy a meal with family or even friends."}
{"text":"So we all know that Chinese buffets are every where these days. But this one really is the best one I've been to. The crab legs are awesome here, seriously. The rest of the buffet has a large selection. The mongollian grill could be expanded but it passes for good. You will usually have to wait for a table, but don't fret, that just means that the food will be fresh for you! the place is bright, clean and up to date. This should be your choice for all you can eat Chinese."}
{"text":"All their food was hot, fresh, consistent and just delicious! Their service was good enough for a buffet, and they even have Kilt Lifter."}
{"text":"Rand H. has gotten me curious about these buffets he loves so much so off we went to for another super lunch. Claire and I met up with Robyn N. and had a nice leisurely lunch.    The location is a bit tricky.  It's on the side of LA Fitness so if you turn into the parking lot go past the front of LA Fitness and turn left.  It's in the corner of the strip mall.  Robyn beat us there so thankfully she texted me to tell me where it was otherwise I would have gone in circles.  My sense of direction is not so good.  :(  Everything is super clean and the restaurant itself is nice.  The service was very good, our drinks were always full and plates clearned promptly.  The food was good but nothing to rave about, imo.  The egg roll was a tad bit greasy for me.  The lo mein was good, plain with some cabbage and carrots mixed in.  Fried rice was decent as well.  I enjoyed the coconut shrimp and the string beans had a nice flavor and cooked perfectly.  Nothing really jumped out at me as being outstanding.  There is also a sushi bar and I did have some California rolls which were fresh and good.    For me, this was good but I'm not sure I would go back simply because it's a bit far from me.  Prices are on par with other buffets and the food is good."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed! Seemed dirty and the food obviously had been sitting out a long time! Won't be back!"}
{"text":"I am not a fan of buffets but this one was worth the money.  Chicken wings were awesome, the meat on the Chinese stir fry's were all tender, the Mongolian food was excellent.  The only bad part was the sushi was horrible.  My problem with these buffets is that I eat to damn much."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting. The restaurant smelled entirely of fish. Very few dishes on the buffet looked appetizing. Only two dishes were beef. It's possible my guest and I went at a bad time.  One star due to the fact that my plate was warmer than my food."}
{"text":"It depends on what type of taste you have, but as a vegetarian there a few notable absences on the buffet.  (Spinach au gratin?)  Everything was hot and fresh and tasty, and the crab rangoon were yummy (very important item!).  At +12 mi. from home, I doubt I will return, but might if I was in the area and hungry.  *Please take down your Christmas decorations, it's July!"}
{"text":"As far as Chinese Buffets goes you really can't beat this place. One downside is their attempt at Mongolian BBQ it's pretty bad. Their Sushi selection is surprisingly excellent. Definitely good value here for a large average buffet with good Sushi."}
{"text":"Great place to satisfy your hunger. I've been to many many Chinese Buffets with my family and coming from CA we can get picky. This buffet is our \"go-to\" place definitely. The staff is more efficient here, they have more variety in the typical hot and cold Chinese food fare, and I think they have more variety on their desserts and sushi also. This place is kept very clean as well!  Love their crab legs here the best! I never go for the claws because you'll get jipped in the meat. GO for the long legs - that's money. I think they are the freshest ones around compared to the other buffets AND they don't just sit in the salted water like most of the other places. (Also it's freshest considering we don't have an ocean next to us) I have a picture I'll post here of my typical plate. I never add rice to my plate because then you don't have room in your belly for the many options this place offers. I do eat rice, but it's coming from the sushi which I think tastes good for an establishment like this.   I've brought visitors from out of state here and they too enjoy the food. They really like the baby octopi, oysters and mussels and they say it's something different they haven't had from other Chinese buffets because they're tasty and not fishy or rubbery. My hubby would agree. I very much enjoy their green beans, mushrooms, walnut shrimp, cream cheese wantons, salmon, sweet and sour chicken and their egg drop soup with the crunchy noodles to garnish. I also like drinking their hot house tea (it helps with digestion btw).  They take competitors' coupons (like from China City Buffet) and we used one last weekend. Saved us 15% off the total bill for a party of 7!  The only bad thing I usually experience here are ignorant people. If you're coming here to eat, don't express out loud \"Eww, what's that?\" and point, don't always go for the \"orange chicken\" thinking it's like Panda because it's not going to be and don't go up to the sushi maker and ask him rudely \"Which one of these just has rice? I don't want no fish in there.\"  (wth?!?) If you want rice, go to the large drum that has steamed rice in it geez...AND don't pile on food on your plate and not eat all of it. You are wasting!! Take small portions and then go back for more. I know I may sound so \"sanctimonious\" or what have you, but I'm just pointing out what people here have done while I've been here.  Easy concept. Come on...  :)"}
{"text":"Came here last night, had about a 20 min wait.. well worth it!  Crablegs were plentiful, and all of the buffet items were full and very hot! This place is better than pacific, doesnt have all of the items of pacific, but they dont ration out the crablegs , and the food items they do have are better tasting! And the dinner price is 12.95!"}
{"text":"I prefer Hibachi Grill Super Buffet at Southern & Alma School. Better variety and taste.  Update 1/3/2017: Drove by there today and #1 Eastern Super Buffet appears to have been PERMANENTLY CLOSED.  Also, it's getting renovated. New name.... Woochi Buffet (?).   I'm guessing that they'll open sometime in the next several weeks. Hopefully it'll continue to have good food at a good price, but also be a cleaner and more focused on treating their customers well."}
{"text":"Never disappointed.  Food is always hot, fresh and flavorful. Lots of choices and never greasy. Probably the best Chinese buffet in town."}
{"text":"This is where you can get not only good Oreintal food but good American choices. They have a wide selection and a sushi bar that is one of the best around. I love it when they have the dishes I like. I don't like it when something I usually like is not available. The sevice is always very good and all you can eat wow! That is good for the whole family or a group of people!"}
{"text":"This would be a ZERO star if I can give one.  We drive 20 Miles RT to this place with restaurant.com certificate which I've paid for with $15 off with purchase of $22.50.  Once we arrived, I spoke to her in Chinese and told her we are using this and she said that they do not accept them at all but will give me a 15% off.  This is clearly a bait and switch and we refused immediately and walked out since I've paid for the certificate.  No I am NOT an idiot.   I had to get a refund from restaurant.com the following day and were pretty angry about the situation.  Will NEVER Return.  Any business should honor their obligation once they sign the contract with the advertiser or take it down."}
{"text":"Hot damn!  If you want more bang for your buck, make the drive out here!  I would say that this Chinese buffet is comparable if not better than Pacific Seafood Buffet, which is one of my favorite restaurants.  The quality of food is fresh and delicious!  I ate everything on my plate!  I tried one of each sushi - all excellent, one with orange sauce was ridiculously spicy and tasty!  The baked crab on the crab shell has haunted my dreams; it was that good!  The tempura vegetables were absoultely delicious - Grade A quality!  All food was hot and fresh; waiter service for drinks was courteous and prompt.  Excellent price!  Lunch with soft drinks was less than $10 and I was full enough to skip dinner!  :)"}
