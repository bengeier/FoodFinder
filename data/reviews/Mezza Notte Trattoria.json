{"text":"The overview indicates \"Reservations: Yes\", however, when I phoned ahead and specifically asked if I could make a reservation I was advised that they do not make reservations... So, that being said, it should be changed to \"No\".  I think I had too high of an expectation when I entered this establishment.  The interior was a tad small, but my date and I had no problem being seating within 30 seconds.  My only issue was the tables were not spaced far enough, or they had too many tables.  While being shown to our seats, even the host had to squeeze through tight quarters from other tables and servers.  The lighting was dim, the decor was dark, and it had a very nice ambiance - just how I like it! (dim and dark is a \"thumbs-up\")  The wine list was nice, as I had tried a few of them at other restaurants.  Though a little on the pricier side, still a nice selection.  I chose from the vino rosso, since i only drink reds.  I picked the Australian Tik Tok Merlot - a nice full bodied red that went well with our meal... veal.  We decided to skip the antipasti and go straight to the main - I had the VITELLO ALLA NIZZARDA and my date had the VITELLO PARMIAGANA. My meal was very tasty!  3 veal scaloppini's in a red wine sauce, with a nice medley of veggies on the side along with roasted potato's.  My veal also came with an assortment of sliced sauteed mushrooms which were full of flavor from the wine sauce.  I didn't eat the potato's, nor can I give a review on the taste of them, since I don't eat potato's.  My dates meal was a lot more delicious than mine!  The veal-parm was almost the size of half the plate; The pasta was cooked to a perfect al dente; And the tomato sauce was nice and zesty!  Her meal definitely trumped mine!  We ended our meal with cappuccino's - always a nice finisher!  The waiter was friendly, and although some people will give minuses to staff for not coming so often to check on them, I felt he came by just the right amount of times.  He didn't pester us nor did he neglect us.  I recommend this restaurant, and will re-attend for sure."}
{"text":"This is definitely your average Italian fare.  I was overly unimpressed but I've definitely had better gnocchi."}
{"text":"nice Italian places in thornhill . Solid food.. Nothing legendary.. But you get good value for what you pay for.   I had the salmon it was very good  Service is pretty good too. Our waiter was really nice and helped make some suggestions.  Will be returning."}
{"text":"I WAS a loyal long time customer of Mezza Notte, until tonight. I made a reservation in advance for New Year's Eve. Upon arrival I was told extremely rudely by both the hostess and the owner that \"my name was not on their list\". I told them I had made a reservation in advance so obviously there was some sort of mix up. Instead of apologizing and trying to make the situation right like they should have if they had any decent customer service skills, they again told me my name wasn't on their list and looked at me like I was lying about my reservation. They then walked away and talked amongst themselves for a few minutes. When the hostess returned she waved at a table right in front of the door and said this is all I have, then walked away without actually seating us. Talk about rude!  It gets better though. When I asked to have my pasta with just tomato sauce, no cream, because I'm lactose intolerant, I was told I would have to pay a substitution charge. Yes, because of an allergy I had to pay extra.   This was probably one of the worst customer service experiences I've ever had. I used to order take out from Mezza Notte a few times a month and visit regularly. That's definitely not happening anymore!"}
{"text":"I am not even going to give one star, I will never go there again. To begin with, waitress came right away with our menu before asking if we wanted a drink. My boyfriend's back was to the kitchen and I was facing it. Their serving supplies are we're behind my boyfriend. When the waitress needed to get oil and vinegar for the table next to us, she would go next to my boyfriend and reach over him to get what she needed instead of going around. She did this three times. One waitress was standing behind there, looking down, big smirk on her face, texting.  We had caesar salad, she brought a basket with the bread and butter. There were 4 of the smallest pieces of bread I have ever seen. The butter was inside the basket with the bread. Upscale restaurants don't do that.  I had veal nazzini, they piled on a pound of carrots, and the roasted potatoes, four pieces, tasted like from a week ago. My boyfriend had the creamy sauce with sun dried tomatoes, sauce was very sour. As we were eating, one of the waitress was bringing pizza for another table. She dropped the serving spatula for the pizza, she picked it up and put it back on the plate with the pizza and served the pizza. That was the same waitress that was texting. Our waitress came by to ask us if everything was ok on the same plate every time she passed by. I will never go back there again."}
{"text":"The staff were amazing and so helpful.  we went yesterday for dinner and ordered INSALATA CAPRESE and CALAMARI FRITTI and were so good. and for the main course we ordered ORECCHIETTE AROMANTICA and a special dish (chicken breast stuffed with cheese and spinach and vegetables on the side) and that when it went totally wrong. Main course took around 30 mins to be served. The food was horrible, the chicken was under cooked, too sour, it was not stuffed with anything and it came with bones! spinach was below the chicken and the cheese was melted on top of the chicken chew skin :(, half a spoon of mashed potato that did not taste good and couple of carrots scattered around the dish. The pasta dish was tasteless, the sausage was extremely chewy and not cooked well with no spices nor flavor what so ever. The pizza was saggy and wet! we returned the chicken dish. and the waitress apologized many times.  I think the chef has no idea what italian food is about. I do recommend the service but not the food!  Not going ever again! food was not good at alllllll"}
{"text":"Really nice Italian restaurant can't go wrong, great pizza, really good calamari,  there whole menu's fantastic, prices not bad either."}
{"text":"They offer many options even for a picky eater. Their pasta was very flavorful.  The interior is a little dim and old, but their food does not disappoint. I would recommend this place if you were craving a good Italian meal.  -CY"}
{"text":"Made an order of seafood order for delivery. Took almost two hours to come. Food was dry clumpy and disgusting.  Will never order again from this place. They should be embarrassed to put out meals like that. Enjoy my 60 dollars..."}
{"text":"The food is not bad, but the service is horrible.  Our waitress had an attitude did not once  check on us or ask us how our food was, and when we asked for water, the person serving looked like he had better things to do.  The salade caprese was not the best I have had.  How can you make salade caprese with stale mozarella cheese and unripe tomatoes?  Pasta was fine though, and I would give this place another chance because of that."}
{"text":"I want to put as 3.5 star  Both Pasta and Pizzas are good. They have some cut pizza and French bread as free bread ( which is a surprise! ).  The reason I put as 3.5 star as the service is 'AWKWARD'. I went 3 times before and everytime the service was unusual.  1. Some waiters do not tell us about the special dish for the day unless we asked. They do not mentioned about the price of those dish.  2. Sometimes, even the restaurant is not that busy, they still ask you to sit in the small table for 2 and I found that there is not enough space for the food.  3. There is a time the waiter did not give me the dessert menu and he told me that he will tell me what they have. He explained the dessert menu is not up-to-date.  If the service is better, I will have a higher rating as the food is always good over there!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is very average. The food is OK and the atmosphere is OK mostly middle aged individuals. We tried the Oriechetta sausage and mushroom risotto. They were OK. I didn't like the scrumbled sausage..I would prefer to have slices of sausage. The bruschetta was good. The vibe is a bit slow and old."}
{"text":"Really great Italian restaurant! Have been back a couple times now and they are consistently great.  Service was fantastic. They were attentive and nice. Kept refilling our drinks and checking on us. No issues anytime I've been there! The place is never super packed in the winter and early spring months but busiest summertime. It's clean and reputable and intimate.   Food was really great everything you'd expect from great Toronto Italian food. I've had the Mediterranean pasta and four cheese pizza along with a couple salads and they've all been top notch and great portion sizes. All in all great place to have a nice dinner!"}
{"text":"Not so good food comparing to price, pizza was soft and dough in the middle and staff are just not ready for the place. Owner/manager is the only person who is running the place. To me This type of organizing  and food is not acceptable for an Italian place."}
{"text":"I originally wanted to get the PAPPARDELLE with lamb ragu but the kitchen was still cooking the lamb and won't be ready for another hour. So I had to change my decision and went with the SPAGHETTI CARTOCCIO - squid ink spaghetti, mussels, clams, tiger shrimp, calamari with white wine, tomato sauce. The pasta came in a parchment bag and it was opened right in front of me, that was pretty neat. The squid ink pasta was homemade, it was very chewy. There was a lot of mussels but the meat was tiny, the calamari was very soft, not tough to chew. The tomato sauce was very tasty. Everything mixed together was ok, I've had better pasta dishes so I was not especially impressed with the dish. Maybe also because I had my heart on the lamb ragu so it didn't add up.  The service was good though, and the place was getting packed later on the dinner shift so it is a popular place."}
{"text":"We celebrated a friend's birthday on a Tuesday night and I was pleasantly surprised to see a fully booked house.  The service was pretty quick between taking our drink orders, food orders and when the food came out - surprisingly so since it was so full.    Onwards to the food: The focaccia/bread was deelicious and completely went with our Penne Mezza Notte that we shared.  It's a $40 gigantic dish to share which had generous portions of mussels, squid, clams, shrimps...and KING CRAB!  The broth was so good with all the seafood juices and tomato sauce.  I did prefer dipping the bread rather than eating the penne though.  We shared a bottle of the Sangiovese Montepulciano, IL Brecciarolo (Italy) which was a lighter red which was so good on its own and great for pairing with the seafood.    This is definitely not the cheapest Italian restaurant I've been to but I think the prices are reasonable for the large portions and quality that you get.  We had a great time and I'd definitely come back here when I have an Italian craving again."}
{"text":"we went to the restaurant with our kids, we ate the margarita pizza and the angel hair pasta, both dishes were very good  the restaurant is a little pr icy . however, the food is great and the service was good"}
{"text":"There aren't many Italian restaurants in the area so if you want a decent Italian meal this is the place to go. The spaghetti cartoccio and risotto di mare are pretty good, and if you feel like pizza they have some very nice toppings to choose from. The target audience seems to be adults but they get quite a few families. Overall not a bad place, and given the lack of other options in the neighbourhood I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Hair inside my dish.  Food is not good.  An inspector should come at this place. Reallly really grossed out. ..... The menus are sticky as well! Serious hygiene problem!"}
{"text":"I will start by saying the restaurant itself is nice, great layout and ambiance. We were seated on a Friday evening, the place wasn't too busy, we were a party of 12  -the service was probably the worst I have ever seen, I asked for a wine list 3 times to the point where I walked up to the bar and grabbed it myself   -took the waitress 30min to clear our plates from the table after our appetizers   -the table had to constantly flag her down to order drinks   I will say the food was pretty good, but the whole experience as a whole because of the service was negative   Definitely not impressed given the cost at the end of the night , way to overpriced for the service and quality of food received"}
{"text":"I've walked by this Italian place so many times, I just had to give them a shot.   Looking in from the outside, this place always appeared very dark and gloomy, and when we were seated inside, the interior is pretty much the same. It was pretty empty on a Saturday night, with a few lone diners. We were quickly seated near the entrance, and our waiter named the specials for the day (none of which were pasta).   We ordered fairly quickly and let our waiter know that we were trying to catch a movie by 9:50PM.   Here's a detailed timeline: 8:10 Arrive at Restaurant 8:15 Ordered our Food 9:10 Waiter informs us he FORGOT to put in our order but ensures we will still catch our  movie 9:20 Food Arrives (The pasta wasn't bad, but nothing amazing) 9:30 After gobbling down our dinner at record speed, we ask for the bill 9:35 Bill arrives and we quickly pay for it.. but wait why is the bill so expensive?  We realize we had just paid for someone else's bill. We bring this to the attention of our waiter, who offered to give us back $5 which was the difference of the two bills.   I find it disappointing that no discount was offered on our original bill and that so many mistakes were made without apology.   The only thing good about this meal was their complimentary bread/focaccias, but I'm not going through that again just for bread."}
{"text":"**3.5 Stars**  Yeah this place is nothing special, except, again, they really have a nice summer patio. This piece of corner is actually not bad. New condo's are sprouting up like crazy.  I really don't like the MN location on Yonge. I remember going there when I was pretty young and didn't think much of it (and never returned). But when my mom told me of this Italian restaurant that had a really great patio, I couldn't resist. As soon as I saw the name though, my initial reaction was oh no.  But as soon as we sat under the sun, it was oh yes. This MN is vastly different from the Yonge St. location: modern and sleek interior. Service, the two times I went, were excellent. The menu is actually quite ho-hum, except I had the Jumbo Grilled Shrimps which were SOOO YUMMY! 4 large sized shrimps on a bed of fresh summer salad. YUM! My mom the one night had the Sea Bass special which was surprisingly delish. A perfectly juicy square piece of plump fish with a nice crusty skin and served beside some Squash and Rapini.   Wine menu's are typically Italian (Pinot for Whites, and Chianti's and Valpolicella's for Reds) and they have lots of half litre choices which is perfect for two.   Now that the summer and warm season is almost, done I doubt I will be back here until next summer. To be honest, without the patio, this place would be nothing special and it is very far from my uptown home. That being said, if you are ever in the area and want to take advantage of the last warm days, then head over to Mezza Notte for a glass of vino and car watching (forget the people!!) as I saw two Ferrari convertibles already."}
{"text":"Years I've passed by this place, turned off by the garish Benz that never seemed to move, and the fact it's right next to a \"Aren't We Naughty.\" But it's become a staple on Yonge North, and the online menu suggested that this wasn't a very pretentiously priced place. I took my best friend Tia.  I don't understand the lighting in Italian Restaurants, it always feels as if I'm seeing things through a whiskey bottle. I guess it's supposed to be romantic, but if that were the case, let's just turn off all the lights altogether.  I'm not well versed in Italian cuisine, so although the menu had descriptions, it still looked like a foreign language novel to me. I left the ordering to our very charismatic waitress who was patient enough to become my pasta encyclopaedia. I got some kind of cheese sauce tortellini, and Tia ordered some kind of potato pasta. I also order the mixed grilled vegetables as an appetizer, and request zucchini with it. Apparently, I didn't know how to pronounce zucchini...  So, our Entrées came first..but somehow I ended up with spaghetti. When I notified the waiter of this, three staff came out apologizing to me as if it were some international incident between China and Italy. There were so many different wait staff trying to console me, I felt like pulling out a whistle and waving a red card. So Tia didn't like the mixed veg because it was cold, I didn't realize this until she pointed it out. I was busy telling another waiter that it was okay that the orders of which the food came didn't offend me. The bread here was mixed, and tolerable. We didn't get any wine, as neither of us were fans of Italian. Our waitress was ultra attentive, but I suppose it was because the restaurant wasn't buzzing by any means. In fact, she was such a regular at our table, I almost offered her a seat. She was however, very entertaining..and so our impression of her was a good one. I might have though made the novice mistake of talking to her breasts half the time. In my defence, they were eye level. I must say, it was perhaps her friendliness that saved the experience. I mean, there were a total of six tables, how can you possibly get my order wrong?  There is miniature statue of an Italian Knight by the door...I have no idea what that's about. The décor was boring. If it were any dimmer, I'm sure I would have mistaken it as a pub.   There was a photo of this gorgeous strawberry cheesecake exploding in strawberries. I refused to share with Tia, so we ended up getting two. When it came...it was something completely different, with no strawberries. Or rather, the strawberry was this wave of colour in the slice...yeah, it was good, but we were disappointed.   Two entrées, two desserts, one water, two sodas, and an appetizer ended up costing $71, plus a $25 tip..I didn't actually expect this dinner to cost me $96 dollars. The food certainly was not amazing, although I did have a enjoyable time. I just don't know whether the food was worth that price. I mean, virtually ever other restaurant nearby serves a full meal for two for half that price, or cheaper. If this was to be most expensive restaurant in the area, then perhaps they could find a niche...and being Italian ain't one.  Perhaps their niche could be a connecting door to Aren't We Naughty...yeah? Now there's an untapped market!"}
{"text":"Portion, check. Service, double check. Food...meh.  I got the whole wheat fettuccine Siciliana, and for $20 (tax +tip) the portion size is good.   The food is pretty bland though, regardless of the plentiful ingredients (green/red peppers, mushrooms.zucchini, eggplant and chicken.) Had it been more flavourful (or not-bland, maybe?) it would have been perfect, but this will not be somewhere I would go again.  The service was good though! But then again I went at three oclock in the afternoon and was the only one there :P"}
{"text":"We ordered for delivery and weren't too impressed with the food. It was a little bland and nothing special for the price."}
{"text":"love being on the patio in the summer especially when I want just a chill evening enjoying my neighborhood.   Tried coming a few times in the winter but its always packed at dinner, so make reservations.  The service is good and prompt. What you expect it to be. Drinks are reasonably priced. I ordered the pizza Genovese and it was delicious!   My boyfriend ordered some veal and shrimp dish and I wish he would just listen to me cause it was bland and smothered in gravy and some green onions with a side of spaghetti... That's why I gave mezza notte only 2 stars. Some of their dishes lack creativity."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my meal here! Caesar salad was to die for!!! Home made dressing was fantastic- Will be going back just for the salad. Had the Veal Scaloppini and it too was delicious... I did have to add a lot of salt though. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Mezza Notte has been in the neighbourhood for years and for good reason. If you're looking for Italian food in Willowdale, this is your best bet.  I've been here several times and I have to say I've never been let down. The staff is friendly, the restaurant is nice, and the food is good too.  The price you pay for the food is amazing and they have something for everyone to enjoy on the menu. Their take-out is good too.  My only critic is the squid ink pasta is a little too sweet, and the washrooms downstairs could use some dusting."}
{"text":"For five years now I have been ordering dinners for the staff at my work and one of the places we ordered from has been Mezza Notte. This year I tried the Chicken with mushrooms in a marsala wine sauce. It got rave reviews from all the staff. Yesterday, April 26, 2018 our company ordered a different meal through Doordash and they completely messed us about and I was desperate and called Mezza Notte to ask them to deliver as soon as possible. They delivered to our office within 45 mins. and the food was even better than it was the week before. I wish to thank all the staff and Natalie who took our order for their help in making a disastrous experience with Doordash come out okay for the staff and owner of our company. Sincere thanks,"}
{"text":"Toronto has a lot of options when it comes to Italian food so when it comes to quality we're spoiled a bit. I personally think pasta is a type of food that is very difficult to mess up but is also very difficult to perfect, making it a challenge for restaurants.  Food here were very typical and mediocre. It wasn't the best food I ever had nor was it the worst, placing itself right about in the middle of the spectrum. If they prices were a bit lower I think this place would have had a great value. If their quality was a bit higher I think the same would apply but it's at that ambiguous point where you think \"it's not bad but I don't think it's really worth it either\".  The seafood pasta I tried the last time had good amount of seafood but tasted a bit bland, as if they were steamed to the point where it lost all the flavours and the sauce didn't get a chance to seep in. Pasta itself was al dente which I love but after about 5 minutes when the pasta cooled a bit it felt like they were almost breaking apart from the brittleness. This might be due to the ingredient of the pasta since I believe it was one of those fancy squid ink black pastas.  All in all I think the place is a bit lacking. I would prefer it to be a more casual and cheaper eats place or a higher priced fine dining but at the moment it seems to be in that middle ground which prevents it from standing out from other establishments."}
{"text":"We just had a fantastic dinner at Mezza Notte. Since I noticed that there have been some mixed review, I wanted to make sure that I posted a review. Several things stood out:  1) Bread basket is AMAZING! Such a pleasant surprise. We were expecting a typical bread basket of white bread and butter, but instead we got spiced tomato focaccia bread, garlic buttery focaccia bread, and yummy Italian bread.  2) Dan was a fantastic waiter! He put our pizza in right away to make sure it was timed to be an appetizer. We had great service the whole time.   3) Vanilla tartufo was incredible! Perfect temperature of the ice cream, not too hard or too melty.   4) Our main courses were delicious and the pasta was cooked well.  We are definitely coming back! Great experience and reasonably priced too!"}
{"text":"Really lousy food. Smoked salmon penne tasted very fishy and not fresh. Terrible pasta sauce on the side penne as well. $3.95 for a kids hot chocolate. Lousy, tasteless pizza. I don't even know how you make food this bad without actively trying."}
{"text":"Just went there again last week and OMG the food is just so so good!!! I would say just get the mains and skip the appetizers and dessert... I found them quite overpriced, but the mains, just wow!"}
{"text":"Being Italian, I've tasted better food from my relatives kitchens than this restaurant. Food was bland and was placed in front of us in such a hurry, I thought the pasta would slide off the plate & fall in my lap! Yes, the place is always packed but it must be because of the convenient location, I don't see how the food can bring you back. The tiramisu tasted EXACTLY like the one's you buy in the frozen food section of the local grocery store! Again, being Italian, I have had many homemade tiramisu and this fell short - if it's homemade as they claim, the chef definitely needs to return to cooking school!"}
{"text":"Disappointing meal and service.  Came here for dinner last night for dinner with my husband. We've been here previously and were extremely satisfied. My husband had calamari fritti for appetizer, wine, the squid ink spaghetti with seafood and I had the pappardelle lamb ragu which to my shock and amazement came with a little extra. As I bit into the first forkful, I cut my tongue on a piece of hard plastic.  Upon discovering the foreign object in my meal, my husband called the waiter over who offered to refire the dish. At this point, I had already lost my appetite. To add further insult to injury, the manager came over to apologize and let us know they wouldn't be charging us for my dish...I most certainly hope not. Needless to say, we were extremely disappointed. The least they could have done was offer a complimentary dessert for their negligence or another dish in its place."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to go here because of the inconsistent and mixed reviews, but they rocked our dinner and I was very happy with the whole night. We had a large group - 18 - so we booked the room at the back which worked very well for us. Service all night was friendly, fast and accurate, and I was very impressed by the efficiency of the staff. The wine list is small but respectable, and we were able to find some good selections at reasonable prices. We started off with an assortment of appetizers - the carpaccio, bruschetta, fried calamari, the rustic della casa platter, and the caprese salad. We gobbled it all up pretty quickly, and nobody had any complaints, so the first course was a success. The entrees were as good or better. I had the veal chop, which was really good. Also getting very positive reviews were the seafood risotto, the grilled mixed seafood, the pizza, heck, pretty much everything we had. The tiramisu also went over really well, but I was too stuffed to have any dessert by then. This place may be inconsistent, but they were on the night we visited, and they fully deserved their rating. Yes, I will be back."}
{"text":"I used to work in 5150 Yonge building, so a frequent flier at this place.  Nothing bad, nothing great, it's the kind of place that you feel safe to take a group to, knowing everyone will find something to his/her liking but don't expect anything to blow you away.   Service can be a hit or miss."}
{"text":"Italian food..pasta la vista baby!!  The scenery here is very mature; almost to the point where I felt kind of guilty for having on my snap back hat. However, there is a bar and a TV playing sports. So I guess they are trying to cater to every age.   TBH- I am very generic when it comes to Italian food- so half the time I had to google image what I wanted- Ordered the bruschetta and much like everything on the menu it was on the $$ side for what the value is. However- their entree's were fairly moderately priced. I ordered the rigatoni della nonna and asked my server to make it very spicy. He answered in his italian acccent- which makes the place feel a little bit more authentic. However the indian chef knew exactly what I was talking about- woaah! he made it fire. Delicious hot fire!  Thankfully, I had my friend's penne veronese to sample- which my mind only allows me to translate as really really good mac and cheese with mushrooms in it. Helped stabilize my burning tongue and the creamy cheesiness was delicious as well.  They have a nice little bread basket that they serve . Overall the price is on the higher end . However experience and quality wise- SURE!   give it a go for some authentic italian food!"}
{"text":"Nice place. Try the lunch menu. Service is not great and it seems that the team is not experienced - main reason for 3 stars only. Food is fresh and good."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this restaurant, it is the full package for wonderful food and amazing service. We are regulars and truly have never been disappointed. Its Thornhill's best patio and the ambience in the restaurant is great. It's simply like coming home, try it!"}
{"text":"Visited on a Sat night, we had a group of 13. We were seated in the private room, it felt like we had the place to ourselves it was so quiet. They were even able to accommodate a semi-crying 2 year old. It was earth hour that night, so they dimmed the lights. I got the Pizza Genovese which was wonderful. We stayed a good 2 hours +, thanks Mezza Notte for a wonderful evening! Only thing that was a hassle is the tiny parking lot in front that only fits about 8 cars. I took the TTC so it's a good 5-10min walk to North York Centre Station."}
{"text":"I've ordered a delivery from these guys and I feel like I need to leave a note of praise!  The order was delivered even before the time that was emailed me! And it was a surprise for my wife as she didn't expect any pizza )).   Now about the food: it was awesome! Pizzas aren't the ones I ate in Rome but are very close! For Canada this is really great!   Godiva double chocolate cheesecake was eaten the day after as we were full with pizzas )) and the dessert was atomic!!! I don't really like cheesecakes but this one was kind of an exception!"}
{"text":"Good local Italian family restaurant. Service is impeccable and the portions are large. If in the neighborhood, it's worth going, if not in the neighborhood, don't make the trip; there is probably a local Italian eatery nearby."}
{"text":"This would be one of my standard 3 star reviews had the service been a wee bit more attentive.  But with mediocre, generic Italian food and absentee service, I can't give them anything more than 2 stars.  We came here to catch up with two of our friends, and the location was between their neck of the woods and where we're staying.  It's located in this somewhat interesting power center-cum-lifestyle center (i.e. it's anchored by a Walmart but they put all of the restaurants on a side street to have more of a \"Main Street feel.\")    Anyways, the decor inside looked nice.  We were seated at a half-booth and I liked the glass tile walls and the gray-on-wood shades were both modern and classy.  Once we were seated, our whole table received menus and bread, and shortly thereafter, water.  The bread was as generic as can be - had the same taste and texture as the baguettes they'd serve in my res dining hall when I lived in Toronto.  As in, bland with a cottony texture.  On the upside, they serve it with both butter and oil & vinegar.  Fortunately, we had good conversation; had this been a meeting with people we didn't like as much or a first date or the like, this could have gone into a downhill spiral.  It took some \"eyeing of the waitress\" and eventually flagging down to get any service - we were never asked if we wanted any drinks.  Eventually, a waitress came to our table and we asked if she was our server and she replied \"there's two of us, so I can be.\"  Hmmmm?    J & I shared the pizza bruschetta, our friends shared the cesar salad, and each couple ordered one pizza and one pasta.  The appetizers were served fairly quickly.  I liked the thin crust on the pizza bruschetta but the bruschetta mix was exactly what we're able to buy at any grocery store in the GTA.  My pasta (the one with rapini & sundried tomato and a garlic-olive oil sauce) was extremely bland with the exception being the rapini, which was overly bitter.  J said his pizza \"was alright.\"    Which again brings us back to the service.  Our water glasses were rarely - if ever - refilled.  I asked for a refill of my Diet Coke, and one was never offered to J; they do charge you again for refills despite it being a fountain drink, so be careful as they're expensive to start with!  It seemed like we either had to wait an inordinate amount of time or find the waitress ourselves to get any service - even picking up the check.    Since we don't live in the area, we weren't planning to come back, but I can't recommend this just because part of dining out is being able to enjoy the experience and the company, and when you're given bad service that really degrades the experience."}
{"text":"I've previously posted a good review about this place, but multiple visits and a year later, none of what I've said previously stands anymore.   The food is bland and overpriced and the service is often abhorrent, not through the fault of the servers (except some), but the fact that they are terribly understaffed - one person serves a full patio.   The fine dining pretence of the place rests on the fancy names of the food in the menu - problem is it doesn't taste like much.    Since there aren't  any real options with a real patio in the immediate area, I may return there for pizza and drinks in the patio, if I'm prepared to risk lengthy wait times and pauses in the service."}
{"text":"Six of us went for dinner and six of us would never return. For example, the menu description for the Mediterranean salad was \"grilled portobello mushroom, belgian endive, red pepper, eggplant, asparagus, mixed greens, goat cheese\", but here is what came on the plate: mushrooms (1), asparagus (1 small piece of about 1/4 inch), eggplant (none), goat cheese (almost nothing), greens (lots), onion (tons). Pasta came in thick sticky, heavy sauce, very unappealing both visually and to taste.  There are many good restaurant options in Toronto, this is not one of them."}
{"text":"Came here dinner around Christmas time to catch up with my cousin. Reservations were made a week before. The restaurant was busy and there were only 2 servers. We sat down but they toally ignored us for 15 minutes, didnt ask us if we wanted any drinks or bread.   Until we tried to flag one of them down.  Finally they bought us some bread, a nice selection but it was really cold. Would be nice if they warmed it up.  We ordered mussels (but they ran out) so we got calamari instead, pappardelle, tortelinni and pizza cosentina. The food was excellent and the portions were good. I loved that they had a selection of homemade pasta.  When we got out bill it looked a bit high, they forgot to take the mussels off and we had to get them to correct it.  Overall horrible service but excellent food. Hopefully the service will be next time."}
{"text":"Service was impeccable - fresh ground pepper and fresh parmesan ready on standby, water refilled without even asking.  I was worried because of the reviews, but after going I feel like the restaurant got a bad rap because of guest's expectations before they even step in to the restaurant. The place doesn't have a cool hipster atmosphere like places downtown. Neither does it offer a world class chef curated menu that you'd take Anthony Bourdain to in his Toronto stopover. It is not a dive either - and the food isn't the 'comfort food' type where it is loaded with grease and whole-flavouredness (*ahem* Dantes *ahem*).  What it does provide is a casual, healthy approach to Italian food.   I think the restaurant is best categorized as ''neighbourhood italian fare', similar to what you'd find at your health-conscious Italian sister's place (not grandmas)??  Dishes aren't over-seasoned or greased up. It was simple and yummy. I can tell they make their own tomato sauce. It reminded me of simple food in Italy.  I liked it, I'd probably go back again."}
{"text":"The food was decent. Steak and the seafood was tasty. Didn't have any appetizer or dessert because I wasn't interested in the items on the menu. The best part was the huge patio on a summer night. Quick service. Would go again for the nice patio that looks onto the calm streets"}
{"text":"i dont really like italian food (well, until recently til tappo and paganelli's.. but anyways). i used to find pasta so boring, plain & bland that i would always end up eating some bland pasta covered in permesean/black pepper. theres no exciting flavors, it just doesnt wake up my tastebuds. THIS was the exact scenario at mezza notte trattoria. plain, boring, bland pasta. bleh. it didnt help that the server was pretty snotty & stuck up, looking so displeased and forced serving us. the pasta dish i ordered was also recommended by this server as well. i dont think i'll ever come back."}
{"text":"This is a nice Italian restaurant, personally I don't know why everyone else is giving bad reviews, I guess they just don't know good food when they see it!  The Focaccia is defiantly the best part of coming to eat here, it's sooo good and also very addictive!  The Veal Parmigiana has been excellent lately!! Its so soft, you don't need a knife to cut into it, it just falls right apart and melts in your mouth! The sauce is delicious, and don't forget the cheese, lots and lots of cheese on the veal!!!  The meal is also very big, you could share with another person!  The best part is, its in walking distance to me, so when I have a craving for some nice veal, I don't have to go hinting around the city as it seems to be hard to find!"}
{"text":"We ordered a calamari in spicy tomato sauce as an appetizer.  The calamari was very tender, and tomato sauce was fresh with a kick.  With the wonderful bread/focaccia, we sopped up every bit of the sauce on the plate after the calamari was all gone.  The main course was angel hair with mushroom in a tomato sauce.  The pasta was cooked just perfectly, al dente, which I find difficult as angel hair gets overcooked a lot.  The sauce was very fresh and seasoned very well.  We also ordered a tiramisu.  According to the waiter, this dessert was made in the restaurant (unlike the cheesecake that was the other choice... from Cheescake Factory).  The tiramisu was light, just the right amount of rum.  Very nicely done.  Our waiter was friendly and very helpful.    We did find the place a little noisy, but it was totally packed on this Saturday night, but the ambiance was acceptable."}
{"text":"I don't get it. This place is almost always full and a lot of the diners are Italian families, so I was expecting the food to be amazing like the restaurants in downtown Little Italy. But it was a big letdown.   We got the oreccheiette aromantica (pasta with crumbled sausage and olive oil) and the crespelle napoletana (crepe pasta stuffed with different cheeses bathed in tomato sauce). Both were average at best (oreccheiette: dry sausage, pasta was on the hard side of aldente; crespelle: good flavour but too much sauce that it was almost a bit soupy). Maybe this place used to be great, and you can see hints of it in how the dishes tasted. But how they were cooked definitely didn't do the recipes justice. Too bad, was definitely hoping for more."}
{"text":"I had a lovely time their with my wife for date night last saturday. We ordered Calamari fritti and a tortelini with rose sauce to share and a rustic pizza. I also love their bread baskets. Things can get a little pricey but such a nice restaurant for date night."}
{"text":"love their squid ink pasta and their tiramisu is so wonderful. such a gem at yonge and finch!"}
{"text":"I met some family here for dinner on a Monday night.  It was on the lower level of a plaza and all street parking was taken.  We entered the plaza area to park and walked down a set of stairs to get to the front door. Not difficult but lots of free parking up top. The restaurant has a patio but nobody was there due to all the construction just out front. Everyone enjoyed their meals....my sister and cousin shared bruschetta and pizza.  Mom had a regular penne in rose sauce and I had the gf penne with asparagus in a tomato sauce.  The tomato sauce was very nice. Mom enjoyed the bread too. The washrooms were not great.  They were going for a modern look by making everything black but the toilets just looked dirty. The service was fine.  Very quick with the meals as we stated we were going to a show."}
{"text":"I will give a decent rated because I'm a regular here because I live nearby...  The food is good, I've had many things on the menu and I can say that there is a lot of tasty things to try and eat !!!  The work staff changes all the time, and this is due to the lack of quality service that everyone is complaining about .  So this leads me to think, owner, manager why don't you read the reviews and act on this. Are you coming and doing your part to make sure your restaurant and staff is property trained or are you on vacation counting the money while people are talking crap about your service!!!!  Think about it"}
{"text":"You would think that after being in business for so long (20+ years) things might slack off a bit, but such is not the case at Mezza Notte which for all you Anglophones, means \"midnight\". The interior is simple yet warm and intimate and the service is attentive, prompt and flexible.  The pasta dishes are all excellent and my favorite dish, Veal Picata, with a side of penne with pomodoro sauce is tender, flavorful and just the right portion. I can't ever remember having a bad meal here. The desserts are fresh and creative.  There is plenty of parking in the mall behind the restaurant and there is outdoor seating in the summer. Definitely one of the best Italian restaurants in Thornhill. Keep up the great work.  https://www.tripadvisor.ca/ShowUserReviews-g499300-d8476008-r444762868-Mezza_Notte_Tratoria-Vaughan_Ontario.html#"}
{"text":"Went out on a Friday night with our best friends and wanted to try something local and close by to our places.  Decided to try Mezza Notte for some Italian cookin'.  Reservations made for 5.  We parked in the Wal-Mart parking lot and walked down the stairs.  When we entered, it looked pretty classy.  Everything had a Moxie's black wood type finish and all the servers were in black too.  Although we were sitting in the dining room, we were connected to the patio setting and the ambiance added something romantic to it all.    Paolo was our waiter and he took care of us during the night.  He was nice, amiable and had a pleasant attitude.  He mentioned that he was turning 21 over the weekend and was excited.  Paolo was quite knowledgeable about the dishes, gave his recommendations as well as articulated the names in his best Italian pronunciation too.  Pretty impressive.  I ordered the Tortellini Alla Panna (homemade meat tortellini, mushrooms, cream sauce) for $19 with an extra side of meatballs for $2 (can't resist trying the meatballs)!  Paolo said it was a good choice.  It took about 20 minutes to arrive which was not too long.  You could see all the chefs cooking up a storm in the background.  When the food came, I got excited and I took a picture immediately.  Photo-op time!  I started to go at it and it tasted absolutely delicious.  It had a creamy texture, and the mushrooms were soft and tasty.  The meatballs were decently done.  It had an okay flavour and I had 2 in my dish so turns out they were a buck each.  They weren't crumbly at all and I wondered about the freshness though homemade.  The \"absolutely delicious\" at the beginning of the meal became tiresome.  The tortellini itself tasted almost exactly like the meatballs but just wrapped in pasta, smothered with the sauce.  Meat Meat Meat.  By no means was it horrible, it's just that the taste fizzled out in the end.  I liked the dish but didn't really move mountains for me.  This dish gets a 3.5.  One of the best parts of the experience was the customer service of Paolo.  He was attentive, gentle, good-natured, checked on us frequently and refilled our waters.  He gets a 4.5.  I would return in the future and maybe try another dish with some recommendations.  Not bad!"}
{"text":"I've never really been too impressed with Mezza Notte. Maybe it is because I'm usually here for the annual office party at their location in North York, but this place really doesn't wow me. I think it's probably because I personally find that the flavour of most of the dishes are either a bit bland or too one note.   Their appetizers were decent, but once again.. could use some work on presentation and flavour. Although I thought their mussels were probably the best out of 3 appetizers, we ordered. Skip the escargot and the portabello and endive salad, too much char on the endive.  The North York location carries Cheesecake factory cheesecake, and for some reason the Thornhill location doesn't; so we eschewed it for a scoop of ice cream at the Marble slab next door.  The service is great, so if the kitchen could up their game a bit, this place would be a great place to have dinner with friends in York Region.   The restaurant seems to take reservations for large parties only,"}
{"text":"Bleh.  Had I known this had only 2.5 stars on Yelp, I would've passed when a coworker recommended this place for lunch.  Sad non-Yelpers.  Woman got a new IPhone from work so I hope she follows my advice on getting the Yelp app.  Anyhow, onto the review.  Bread was fantastic and in fact probably my favorite part of the meal.  My breaded veal with peppercorn was not working for me at all but the veggies weren't bad.  They also got a new waitress serving us so there was a lot of back and forth with questions."}
{"text":"As others have already pointed out in previous reviews, everything is there for this restaurant, except for food quality... and also maybe that it is located in a sketchy plaza with a dirty looking sex shop.  As for the food, I'd rather get a quarter size of their portions and more flavour.  The dishes were either overly salty or incredibly bland.  The pasta was cooked very well, but it lacked what some would describe as passion and love for the food itself.  My seafood fettuccine had seafood in it, but it just didn't have the seafood flavour.  Perhaps the seafood was from frozen, or the cream sauce didn't have any seafood juices in it.  The service was great though, she managed a large group of us and helped us pack our food and out the door in a timely manner.  It made for an acceptable turn-around time for a lunch outing during work hours."}
{"text":"We had the mussels to start, and then the 4 cheese pizza and the lamb ragu parpadelle. First of all, the portions were massive and the price was very reasonable, already a plus in my books. Next, the quality. The mussels were decent but I think they were lacking a bit of freshness (3.5/5). The pasta was fricken great; large chunks of lamb, freshly made pasta, definitely a fave (5/5). Finally, the p. The dough and crust was actually perfect; thin, crispy with just a little bit of bite. Only thing is I would replace the 4 cheese for the traditional margarita pizza. The cheese mix was a little intense (4.5/5)."}
{"text":"Discovered this neighbourhood gem tonight . Food was great- portions were very generous . Service was friendly ...   The restaurant was larger then I expected and full! Will definitely be going back.!"}
{"text":"Drove this place many times.. Heard them on the radio.. Though I'd give it a try..   Reading the reviews, sounds like they have service issues and food being over salted and nothing special.. Didn't really see anything about pizza (good or bad).. So I avoided everything bad in the reviews.. I didn't do a dine in, did a take-out pizza..   Walked in to pick up my order, place was nicely finished, was deserted tho.. Had one table and 1 waitress going on at 2:15pm on a beautiful Friday afternoon before the long weekend.. Ambience was nice and thought to myself, I wouldn't mind dining in at this place.  Consentina Pizza including tax was $20.50 and only comes in 11 inch.  Toppings were grilled zucchini, grilled eggplant, grilled potatoes, grilled red peppers, mozzarella, and fresh herbs  I personally prefer vegetarian pizza over meat pizza.. And love those toppings.. And think they would go great together so I had high hopes..  Overall tho, was disappointed.. The crust was thin but soggy, oily, and super chewy.. Didn't taste any flavour except for red peppers.. Nothing explosive or distinct.. I think they did a really bad job on the crust and flavour. Toppings didn't stick, texture was off, mozzarella cheese didn't work and wasn't stringy... Pizza tasted bland"}
{"text":"About one month ago, attended on a Saturday night with a party of seventeen. Service good, food excellent, wholesome Italian style...Focaccia excellent, and dishes came out simultaneously for the whole party.  Only criticism, place a bit dark and decor a little old fashioned---but judging how full the place was, the patrons don't seem to mind. The house Merlot (Italian, of course) smooth and pleasing to the palate... All in all a happy evening...."}
{"text":"I'll agree that this place is a little over hyped and isn't as good as some people make it out to be. However, it doesn't mean that it doesn't have good food.  When I went there for the first time there was a bit of a wait and I was told that they don't take reservations so it's a little annoying that way.  When we sat down, the place was packed and the  atmosphere was \"jumpin' \" as the kids say.  I ended up getting the Crespelle alla Napoletana which was very good. It's hard to find good Italian food in Toronto and the food at Mezza Notte is on the higher quality side.  It's on the pricey side but if you want a classy night out, this should be an option to consider."}
{"text":"Went there on last Saturday night. Had a reservation for 8pm which obviously meant nothing. We were seated at 8:40pm. Our waiter came up to us and was very unfriendly obviously since we were the last people seated he couldn't wait to finish his shift. He came up to us 3 times asking if we were ready yet. Never once did he say would you like an appetizer and when we asked what the house wine was he actually had a scowl on his face. (Couldn't figure that one out). Are food took a while, mine and my friends was quite good but my husband's was not. My friend asked for another diet coke and he rudely said \"There are no refills, so we have to charge you for it). How offensive, why would you even say that, he took his time bringing it so she proceeded to get up and get it herself. She spoke to the manager about it and we never saw our waiter again after that not even to ask if we wanted desert, another drink, nothing. The only nice person was our bus boy, he had great manners. Anyways, this place sucks, no class. If you're looking for great service, nice ambiance, and a nice evening out don't go there!"}
{"text":"Been here a number of times but not for a few years....the reason being that it's is over priced and the service is meh. That and there are cutting fees when you bring your own cake for a party. I resent that after spending $250, they have the nerve to do this.  As to the food, it is good but I always feel robbed. They are not reinventing the wheel here."}
{"text":"OMG the chicken fettuccine Alfredo here is to DIE for. You can taste the richness and creaminess of the fettuccine sauce. It comes with 2 cheesy bread sticks, a great large portion!!"}
{"text":"Lunch was good , service a bit slow .  Everyone enjoyed their pizza, salad with grilled calamari and panini. And of course price is reasonable during lunch time ."}
{"text":"I had dinner at this establishment last night and I thought that the food was good but not great.  I have noticed that other reviewers commented on poor service but our server was very attentive.  However, the restaurant was not overly busy last night.    We ordered the grilled calamari in a spicy tomato sauce.  The calamari was cooked perfectly and was very tender and sauce tasted very fresh and was good (although not very spicy) but the presentation left a lot to be desired.  I wish I would have taken a picture of it.  The pieces of calamari were just kind of thrown on a plate which was covered in sauce.  I guess I have been spoiled by the places I have been going to recently since the presentation at these restaurants has been clearly thoughtfully considered.   After all, we eat with our eyes first, right?    I ordered the Insalata Italiana (assorted greens with kalamata olives, red onions and tomatoes tossed in a balsamic vinegar and extra virgin lemon olive oil dressing).  It was good sized salad with maybe three or four olives and relatively light dressing.  I should have asked for more balsamic but I was deep in conversation and didn't bother.    One of my friends ordered the Caprese salad and the other the Insalataalaa Mediterranea (grilled portobello mushrooms, Belgian endive, eggplant, red peppers and asparagus topped with goat cheese seasoned with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar).  They both enjoyed their salads.  The latter was definitely a main-meal sized portion and looked very tasty.    My friend and I shared the pizza calabrese (fresh tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, fresh mushrooms, hot soppressata, black olives and roasted red peppers).  This was a large pizza on a thin crust and the soppressata was delicious.  I loved the pizza.    I would certainly give this restaurant another try.  The price point is reasonable and the food was good.  I would like to try the meat dishes and their pasta.  The outside patio is huge which is another plus when looking for outdoor summer dining in the Thornhill area."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance, but only average Italian food. But in this area, not too many Italian restaurants, so I guess this is why they are still around. NOT CHEAP for what you get"}
{"text":"Great service and food. Had the veal chop followed by the cheesecake for dessert. The veal was cooked perfectly- a great dinner plate... and dessert hit the spot!"}
{"text":"The decor is nice, the layout is OK, but the food... It definitely needs some work.  Many of the dishes that came out were over salted and also over cooked.  The grilled salmon was over seasoned (did not order the blackened) and was overtly salty and very well done. The pastas were also served past aldente but the sauce that accompanied was again very salty, almost taking away from the accompanying highlights of the dish.  The washrooms are clean and well stocked but had an over powering smell of perfume to make you gag.  For the price point, I would not come back until they work on the food quality."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place is always busy... am I crazy? the food isn't great at all... small portions and way over priced... will not be back there any time soon..."}
{"text":"The first time I dined at Mezza Notte Trattoria (MNT), it was a casual fine dining restaurant, with many pricey main entrees to choose.  It simplified its menu and removed the pricey mains a few years ago.  Therefore, I now consider it a lower-end casual fine restaurant.    The atmosphere and decor are what lifting it to the \"fine\" level. The food is a different story.  MNT serves mainly pizza and pasta, plus a few veal and chicken entrees.  The pizzas are okay but not much better than the gourmet pizzas from boutique pizzerias, such as Mama Pizza and My Little Pizzeria.  The pasta with red sauce is tasty but the one with rose sauce is average.  In conclusion, MNT is an okay restaurant.  It is a good, old, stable neighborhood restaurant that you can come every month for weekend dining.  I'd like to compare it to Swiss Chalet, Pickle Barrel or East Side Mario.  It is unsurprising but reliable, like an old charming pal."}
{"text":"Brought family here for winterlicious last night. I booked a table to make sure we don't have to wait. We got there 5 minutes before the reservation time, but still have to wait 30 minutes to get seated, also had to remind waiters/owner that we are still here twice. Got our table, menu was great, lots of choice. The place is pretty noisy, but nice. It took them 30 minutes to make our drinks, forgetting one, and another 40 to bring appetizers. When it came to mains, it took another 40 minutes to bring everyone's to the table. Everyone's except for 1 person, who was seating without food another 20 minutes while everyone already had theirs. Then we got coffee (which apparently took 30 minutes to make). Couple of us wanted some limoncello, the girl said no problem, 10 minutes later she came back and said they only have warm limoncello, we told her it's fine. Another 10 minutes later she came back and said that they do not have any limoncello at all and asked if we would like something else. At that point everyone finished coffees and dessert, so we said no thanks. When we got home and looked at the bill, we found out that we were charged for limoncello, 2 shots! Overall, I would give 3/5, but service was 1/5! We will not be coming back. May be the one in Vaughan is better, but Yonge & Sheppard one is pretty awful..."}
{"text":"I went here for my mothers birthday in July and had an amazing time! The food was phenomenal, we loved the atmosphere, and the waiters were so friendly! Every chance I get I always recommend this restaurant to my friends and family, I feel like it was an experience everyone should have!"}
{"text":"Mezza Notte was really busy when we got there.... but after eating there I'm not really sure why!    Mezza Notte can only be described as bland.... I often wonder if this entire strip of Yonge Street around North York City Centre is just bland, much like the food in the Entertainment District in Toronto is just mediocre.  I have yet to be proven wrong!    I ordered some rigatoni with sundried tomatoes, olive oil, rapini and olives.  Typically, at a good Italian restaurant the taste of each ingredient will be fused together.  In this case, it was almost like they boiled some rigatoni, threw in a couple ingredients from a can (save for the rapini  and left it as that.  The pieces of rapini were humungous - I had entire stalks in my pasta that were difficult to eat.    Our appetizer, the bocconcini with the tomato, (caprese?) was good, although again, somewhat bland.  I suppose bocconcini is supposed to be bland, but not this bland!    The only one thing that was good was their bread basket.    Service was a little bit poor.  The waitress did not pay attention to details and we often had to ask her for things (i.e. she took away forks, didn't come back with new ones).  She was also a little bit klutzy - I felt a bit bad because I'm not the most graceful person in the world, but I am also not a waitress!  She dropped several dishes and broke them, and even knocked over a table (which was to her credit, loose) and sent a couple plates flying.  There were still several pieces of broken dishware on the ground when we left.  Also, when sprinkling parmesan cheese on to our food, she sort of sprinkled it all over the table, the floor and into my lap.  Eeek.    I don't think I will be returning here."}
{"text":"I have heard good things about this place from someone but after reading the reviews on yelp, I never thought about going until my friend suggested. The yelp review was correct.   We went with a group of 7 and it looked a bit busy on an early sunday evening. The atmosphere was nice, however, none of us really enjoyed the food there.  Most of the dishes we ordered either lacked of flavor or had too much tomato sauce. For similar price you could get much better italian food somewhere else."}
{"text":"**3.5 stars**   One of the only nice Italian places in thornhill with a patio. Solid food.. Nothing legendary.. But you get good value for what you pay for.   I had the veal parmigiana (comes with good portion of pasta) for $21. Big piece of veal and lots of pasta and complimentary bread was definitely a fair price. And it was good!   Service is pretty good too. Our waiter was really nice and helped make some suggestions. Next time I'm getting g the marsala chicken. Apparently it comes with 3 chicken breast   Will be returning."}
{"text":"Friendly helpful staff. Lots of smiles and recommendation.   We Had the antipasti plates, selection of various breads with dipping oils and butter.   Penne with seafood and my favorite veal Marsala with grilled shrimp. Nice selection of beers.  Kids went with pasta and pizza.  This is a medium price dinning house.   Thirteen people ate and drank beer n coffees. Bill came to $500 plus tip.   Again. Great attentive service."}
