{"text":"I wrote a review on this restaurant and now it is gone?   Do not waste your money here. I am a firm believer in supporting local business but this place needs some help...zero stars....go go Manhattan Deli...not happy that my post was removed...."}
{"text":"I went there cause I saw there ad I'm going to be honest food was terrible the service was just as bad please save your money up and enjoy another restaurant the dishes smelled funny I question there knowledge about a restaurant the employee were flustered and all they kept saying was were so busy and I counted plenty of empty seats I felt like saying no you have no clue what you are doing and of the cook if. He isn't the owner him and the staff should be replaced if he is the owner he deserves failure for serving his junk food"}
{"text":"This morning in the great debate of what to do for breakfast, the boyfriend and I decided to head to Giant Eagle for some supplies. On the way, the $2.99 breakfast special sign prompted a turn around and we decided to try it out.  Tucked away behind the Pier 1 on the side is the Around the Corner Cafe. We walked in and were greeted promptly and picked a booth. After looking over the menu, we both went with the Cardinal which was the breakfast special including 2 eggs our choice, bacon, ham or sausage and toast of your choice.  Everything came out just as ordered and couldn't have been better. 

We have been looking for a spot like this in the area and are excited to go back.  It's family owned and are excited to join the neighborhood. The menu is pretty basic but offers a variety of breakfast options including a build your own omelette with up to 4 fillings and a great looking lunch menu. Everything is bought fresh and prepared in the kitchen. No frozen burgers here. And you can't beat the prices. Can't wait to try them again so if you are in the area looking for breakfast or lunch head to Around the Corner Cafe!"}
{"text":"Based on one review I decided to take a chance on this place. I am glad I did!
The food is great, everything was cooked perfectly. The prices are great, you can eat a great breakfast and coffee for less than $10.00.
The place is clean and the staff is very friendly.
Give this new place a try, you won't be sorry."}
