{"text":"I tried the fish fry today. I have to start by telling you I am a food snob. That being said, the fish was ok. My kids had the shrimp (butterflied frozen kind), not too bad. The fries were the cheapest frozen money could buy and cold. The coleslaw was also pre-made and mayo drenched. Speaking of mayo the tartar sauce was that and lemon juice. I might of saw 2-4 specks of pickles in it. Now the good. The service was green but very attentive. She checked back often and got what we wanted and found out the answers to all of my questions. The atmosphere was dated 1950's-ish and the sticky table didn't help. A hole in the wall, but ok. I have had the chicken noodle soup in the past and was good. ~cheers  

ps. park on the east side of building because the lot was muddy as hell!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent place to eat. My first try eating eastern European cuisine so I really can't make an accurate review. The staff was really friendly and attentive. The portions are huge but the prices can get expensive depending on the dish. I'll give this place another shot if I'm around the area and maybe I'll try other eastern European cuisine in the Cleveland area."}

The chicken noodle soup is divine-- Eastern European comfort food!  They make it from scratch and use plenty of fresh carrots, celery, chicken and egg noodles.  I'm definitely going back if I get sick and need soup!!

Salad-- iceberg, with some good croutons, tomatoes and cuckes-- nothing to write home about.  The rolls are commercially bought, but hearty, crusty and served hot.

I was just a tiny bit slightly disappointed with my goulash.  While plentiful and tender, it lacked spice.  Same with the paprikash.  It would go from pretty good to super awesome if they would up the spice.  Really it was tasty, but needed some punch.

The noodles-- I think they are called tarhonya-- are tiny spaetzle-like dumplings.  They are fabulous.  I could eat plates and plates of them either covered in whatever sauce they have, or just fried in a bit of butter.  Starchy, starchy wonderfulness.

The place is a bit dive-y, but clean.  the staff is very, very nice and attentive."}
