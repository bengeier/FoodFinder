{"text":"Most of these reviews are a travesty!  This place is ... at best ... a knock-off of a real deli.  The food, the ambiance, the \"vibe\" ...  all lacking.   Is there something going on here other than the food??  Don't bother going is you're really interested food."}
{"text":"I loved it! Great Lebanese food at a good price. The breakfast was also great."}
{"text":"It's where the locals go and for good reason.   Friendly service and good food.  Try their crepes, excellent.  Corned beef hash is home made and good."}
{"text":"OMG!!!!!!!!!!! The food here is absolutely out of the world. Have never had a bad meal or a nasty waitress yet. Tried the Reuben, gyros, Corned beef and several different breakfasts. This place is worth going to."}
{"text":"Corned beef is really good and lean.  The prices are low for how much food you get.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"It's like visiting good friends who have an amazing farm and are professional diner cooks."}
{"text":"Sweetest, nicest people ever. Ate breakfast here and the food is delicious home cooked type food at great prices. Happy I found this place :-)"}
{"text":"I have an appreciation for small family owned restaurants. Their food tends to be good and their hospitality is too notch. This place was no different. It's no boutique restaurant aesthetically, but the food was great (and quick!) we stayed overnight on a road trip. If we come this way again I would stop here. The prices were EXCELLENT. I got two pancakes, two eggs, two pieces of bacon and two sausages all for just $5."}
{"text":"All the food we have ordered from Sammi's Deli has been amazing. Mostly order breakfast or one of their delicious corned beef sandwiches. Employees are always friendly and helpful as well."}
{"text":"This is a great little deli, the food is delicious, the prices are fair, the service is very friendly. Great corned beef sandwiches and scrumptious coffee!"}
{"text":"I love this place for breakfast! Always reasonably priced, I often find one of the daily specials to my liking. Stop and pick up a paper or magazine next store and then come over for breakfast,"}
{"text":"An awesome waitress named Taj took care of us this morning. Our meal was great ,price was right, and portions were large . I will be back"}
{"text":"I had the tomato cheese bacon omelet and home fries. There wasn't any seasoning on anything, that I could tell. The service was good, but the food was mediocre. I was disappointed, because I was looking for a great place to be a \"local \". I guess I'll keep looking.  :/"}
{"text":"Classic family restaurant. Virtuous and fast service with good and extremely affordable food. Breakfast is generally when we go, anything from the standard eggs, toast, and bacon to the banana caramel French toast are excellent. We go here almost every Sunday and have never been in satisfied with it! We went for lunch once, it was also very good. We love middle eastern food this was pretty good. I got the falafel wrap and she got the Lebanese combo. Both met our expectations and were close to top places like Aladdins or Sittoos. Recommend if you are looking for a warm and welcoming place to go eat with good simple comfort food."}
{"text":"North Olmsted the unofficial restaurant capital of the west, brings us yet another great feedery. SAMMI'S DELI. The corned beef is on par with Slyman's. The breakfasts are great. Among my favorites is the French toast always good. I recently had breakfast there with my wife I tried The Monte Cristo, as I had expected it was exceptional and very favorable. My wife also enjoyed her breakfast. As always the service is great along with the attention to detail. Next time you need a good food fix and your in the area, GREAT NORTHERN, stop in and enjoy a great DELI.

{"text":"Awesome for breakfast and for lunch.  Excellent food, reasonable prices, and warm, friendly service.  We eat there often and it's consistently delicious!  Recently ordered party trays that were outstanding!  Loads of beef, turkey, corned beef, ham, cheese ; all was beautifully arranged on a platter with plenty of salads, breads, horseradish, mustard, etc.... everything to make delicious sandwiches.  Great food, excellent service.  They also do \"phone order-pickup\" service, as we see many people come and pick up their orders while we dine in. I highly recommend it as a perfect place to have a casual meal that tastes great, and their prices are very reasonable!"}
{"text":"Really disappointed.  Not restaurant people.  This is a family joint that isn't very good.  Bad coffee is the worst thing you can have at a breakfast place."}
{"text":"I've only been here for breakfast and it's solid. Pancakes, eggs, great omelets....For $4.99 I got 2 eggs, 2 pancakes, 2 sausage and 2 bacon. 

The location / atmosphere leaves a bit to be desired, but it's clean and the staff is so friendly that it's a breakfast top choice for us in the area."}
{"text":"Love this place! The people are friendly and food is great! Love the homemade yogurt sauce!"}
{"text":"Got the corned beef and it was delicious. Great little mom and pop shop. No complaints"}
{"text":"Sammi's was perfectly adequate for breakfast between soccer games. Great prices & portions! Our server was quite pleasant.

Sausage gravy & biscuits was just ok, but spinach & feta omelette was tasty. Chocolate chip pancakes were quite large."}
{"text":"Second weekend in a row coming here for breakfast and they did not disappoint! Their breakfast menu is HUGE...and they also have some specials on their board to choose from. The prices are amazing and the staff is so friendly and welcoming. I feel like that is hard to find nowadays. 

Sammi's is located in an unassuming plaza right next to the BMV. The first time the bf and I came here I got the delicious blueberry pancakes special...two pancakes, two eggs, two pieces of bacon and two pieces of sausage. Holy food for around $6...and I ate it all. My boyfriend had a croissant sandwich and I was kind of jealous I hadn't thought about getting that first. The croissant was perfect...flaky and soft. Yum. 

The second time we came I got the eggs benedict, which was amazing...and the boyfriend got a ham and cheese omelet which was also so delicious. I am so happy we found an amazing breakfast spot to become regulars at! Check this place out if you are in the area! It will not fail your tastebuds!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Corned beef hash was solid: not too salty, with the right amount of crispiness. I had it with 3 eggs and a potato pancake for $5.99.
So far, this was the best potato pancake I've had in Cleveland. I don't know what seasoning they use (basil? Oregano?), but it had such a wonderful taste - and it was moist enough, too - that I didn't feel compelled to drown it in sour cream and applesauce."}
{"text":"Was out and about and needed to kill some time. Found this awesome breakfast place, tucked away off the beaten path. 

I have a huge preference for smaller, family owned breakfast places. 

Sammi's is a gem. A testament to the \"American Dream\", where hard work, good food and a warm smile lead to success. 

I entered the unassuming storefront and was greeted by a huge smile and a wave from the kitchen (assuming that's Sammi) like I was a life long customer and friend. You don't get that vibe often, and it proved sincere. 

I am particular on my corned beef omelet. It has to be fresh cooked and cut, not out of a can or from Sysco. The corned beef omelet here is fantastic and well portioned. 

Service was fast and friendly. Another warm smile and a hello, so it is definitely a standard. 

If you are in the area and want to have a great (and inexpensive) breakfast experience, find your way to Sammi's. It is well worth it, and they deserve and will earn your business."}
