{"text":"Great service and yummy fresh margaritas!  Greeted friendly every time and food is very good along with great queso dip. They support local schools and have a back room for meetings and are very attentive. Will be back and recommend!"}
{"text":"Great food and drinks. Omar is by far the best waiter in town, got us some good shots, even shared in some good conversation. We have made this place a usual go to now."}
{"text":"Good food and quick service. My favorite is their Flautas. Food is always fresh and hot.  Great place for families."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in the area. The food is delicious, the service is friendly and there is no wait. I love their chimichangas, but I've never had anything off of their menu that I didn't enjoy."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here tonight after driving by and discovering that our usual mexican restaurant (Mariachi Locos in Stow) had closed down.  It was very comparable to pretty much ever other mexican restaurant I have been to.  The prices are very reasonable and service was very quick.  We waited maybe five to ten minutes for our meal.  I really liked the ambiance and decor of the restaurant.  I felt bad because it was a Friday night and they were barely half full.  I hope they last because they're only a mile away from our house."}
{"text":"Our favorite!! Consistently the best Mexican around. The wait staff is attentive and courteous and the food is always spot on. Love the Burrito Tropical, Tacos de Asada, their guacamole is good.... Who am I kidding ? It's ALL good. There are two locations but the Falls location is a but homier and a more laid back experience. BOTH are great food wise so wherever you are closer to give them a try, you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"First time we came here we were happy with the portion sizes and overall the food was yummy. It is a traditional Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"We ordered the sampler platter. I liked the the tamale. The margarita tasted like country time lemonade, but lime flavored.The chips were thin and warm. The guacamole was a bit oniony. The waiter who is related to the owner was very nice and said they can make anything to order. I had asked about mole sauce, but they don't have enough demand for it to make it up everyday. They do make it for the family and you can ask just in case. I'm still searching for the perfect margarita. I want to like everything so the search continues."}
{"text":"I was going to put a half of star but u can't do I expect a thank you nevertheless the water to ice cube ratio was 25 to zero the was no water it's water. Can you not serve fried turd pls  there was a black hair of course in my chimpy changa  its was terrible  there was nothing good I went there a week ago and still have explosive diaarira thanks u no thank you.

{"text":"I've eaten at the El Rancho on West Exchange street in Akron several times and have always enjoyed the food. This time I, and seven friends, decided to try the one in the Falls. I found the salsa to be very good, very flavorful, some of the best out there. The queso dip is now also among my favorites.  For dinner I had the Burritos Decebrados, two shredded beef burritos topped with chili con queso (I know, I already have the queso dip), served with refried beans. The burritos were good, just as I expected. I would have preferred a smaller serving of beans, maybe half, with rice added to the combination. I think it would have made the meal more complete.  I would normally give this place four stars. But the overall service makes me downgrade it to three. Some of the meals were not accurate. When it came time for the checks, well, there was just no rhyme or reason how they could be so messed up. We were very specific when we sat down as to who were together and who weren't (two couples and four individuals). The bills showed people having their meals combined on one check even though they weren't sitting next to each other. One person had to have their check corrected twice, the first time because not everything they ordered was on the bill, the second time because too much was on the bill. Another person had their meal on two different checks. Also, their \"Belly\" system, the system that keeps track of frequent visits, was off.   My other disappointment, and I know it is entirely my fault and did not enter into my rating, is that there are no specials on Sunday. Every other day has either drink specials, food specials, or both. I need to keep that in mind the next time I go."}
{"text":"Food is standard for a Mexican restaurant. Have to give 5 stars for the service alone! Extremely welcoming and great service! Pretty much every time I come I am given a complimentary shot of tequila at the end of my meal. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I have visited El Rancho's several times and have never been disappointed. However, most recently I was there and had the tacos el pastor Mexican style at the recommendation of the server and it was truly phenomenal. He also asked if I wanted their hotter homemade salsa which was delicious!.This place is a true hidden gem of a restaurant. Always fresh and the service is very personable. One of my favorite local places!"}
{"text":"Pleasant surprise! The food is really excellent and overall great value. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The place wasn't too busy Friday evening when we arrived. The salsa was good, quesadilla was good as well as the tacos. Nothing really stood out to me here. Ordered a few \"fresh made\" margaritas that were not on the menu. These were okay but for $11/ea they were nothing to get again.   Sever was friend and food was quick. This place isn't bad it just doesn't stick out amongst the plethora of other Mexican restaurants in a 40 mile radius."}
{"text":"Meh......when I don't get the steak carnitas...I'm just left dissatisfied.  Got the lunch portion of the chimichanga and it was so bad.  Like the food had a bad after taste to it. Either they're storing their food without lids and it's taking on the other refrigerated items or I don't know?? It just wasn't the level of quality what I've had there before. Disappointed kinda.  And the server that we've had the last 2 times could be more friendly. When we get the men...they at least \"act\" nice.. you ARE in the service industry. So at least fake it like everybody else does...lol. I HATE leaving bad tips bcuz I was in the service industry most of my life....but I refuse to tip this woman but only a few dollars bcuz she's so off putting. I hate being like that.   This honestly will be our last trip there. Sad to say...  I could have kept my $24  and made a rockin meal at home cuz it wasn't anytg special. That's for sure.  Sad face : ("}
{"text":"This place is awesome and far better than other Mexican restaurants in the area! I was a huge fan of the queso fundito appetizer and steak fajita quesadilla. The food is fresh, hot, and plentiful so come hungry!"}
{"text":"Food comes out fast and the servers are fantastic. Prices are cheap and they always have specials. I wish they would update the busted seats and expand the restaurant. I hate when I get seated by the door and the check out line and waiting line is right next to my food. Other than that I love this place!"}
{"text":"Needed to grab a quick lunch. This restaurant did not disappoint. Service was prompt and the place is clean.   Food was fast but actually very good. Most Mexican restaurants have standard fair but some are a bit better. This is one of those. There is nothing out of the ordinary or special. But it was good and better than most at the basics.   Servers were attentive and our beverages were never empty. Would stop again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Had dinner with the family last night. (6/8/15) first timers. We custom ordered a pitcher of margaritas. Came out perfect. Complimentary chips and salsa were very good. We asked our waiter if they had anything spicier and he quickly brought one out. My husband was in heaven. Our meals were done perfectly and each one unique. My husband had the chicken chipotle fajitas. He loved them so much he practically licked his plate clean. Omar our waiter brought another hot salsa he custom made for us to try as well as a couple complimentary shots of high end tequila.  All in all a specatular meal and service. Price was as expected but well worth it! This is now our number one go to for Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Family friendly and able to accommodate large parties on short notice. Staff is warm and helpful and food is good - much better than other local Mexican places. Good chimichangas and excellent queso fundido! Make sure to scan your Belly card to get free food in the future."}
{"text":"This place is an average cheaper Mexican restaurant. The atmosphere is okay, there are more decorative restaurants out there but it's still kinda cute inside with some Mexican themed decor. We went on a Saturday evening and it wasn't too busy. The service was very attentive and food came out really quick. The Saturday special was an original pitcher for $13.99, which had a ton of ice in it -- was overall an average marg.  If you are a vegetarian, they have at least 6-7 different vegetarian options. My friends, who ordered off the veggie menu, said it was the best veggie burrito they've ever had - which is either a testament to the margs, the food, or both.  I ordered a \"super burro\" with chicken and it was honestly one of the best burritos I've had in a while! Perfectly cooked, tasty, and HUGE for a cheap price of $10.99. I was only able to eat half before I had to admit defeat. We didn't get dessert because we were so stuffed, but I'd come back to El Rancho for sure and would recommend giving it a try if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Fast and yummy Mexican food. Love this place and they have specials every day. Huge menu and the staff is friendly and helpful with the menu. Chicken quesadillas were amazing and lots of cheese. Plenty of space and lots of room for big parties. Cheap and super quick. $-$$"}
{"text":"Great Restraunt, friendly attentive staff with reasonable prices. Have visited 3 times and we were never disappointed.  Opened after remodeling the old Reggie's on Stare Rd.  Check 'em out!"}
{"text":"Daily specials for lunch and dinner keep us coming back for something different on random days.  Margaritas are not the average neon fare found at other local restaurants... fruity, but strong... make a good Friday night start to the weekend.  Salsa is made in house and always a different temperature... usually ranging from mild to medium... but occasionally hot.  Refried beans taste house made and the rice is always fluffy and tasty.  They participate in Belly and we are working our way through the perks for remembering to scan now that they are our go to Mexican in the area."}
{"text":"Service and food is great...they have the best margaritas in town! The food is fast, great tasting, and served with a smile!"}
{"text":"Pretty good place.  Nice atmosphere.  Food came out a little too quick.  Texana Fajitas were some of the best in the area.  Lots of meat in them, and great taste.  Margaritas were good but not great.  Still like El Camp's a little better.  Overall, a good place."}
{"text":"The menu price is messed up! For lunch on Sunday's, they charge you a dollar extra! It's not listed on the menu, that there is a up-charge on Sundays for the lunch menu!  She said that she thought I knew because I looked familiar.. that is messed up!  First time there and definitely won't be back.  She should have been courteous and gave me the listed price.  But nope!  I could have pushed the issue, didn't want to stir it up for a dollar.  Food was mediocre nothing special, just your normal Mexican restaurant...  oh and stingy with the chips and salsa. Thumbs down!!!"}
{"text":"In the class of American Mexican casual restaurants, this place out performs all others. The staff is great, you're served about 5 minutes after you order, and the chips are solid. The food quality here is heads and tails better than any competition. The meat is much higher quality, rest of the food always seems fresh, but the best part... margaritas! You won't find a better tasting house margarita, particularly for the price. If I want a solid Mexican food feast and margaritas, I will drive 45 minutes to this place instead of wasting my time any where else."}
{"text":"This is your typical Mexican restaurant.  Food was good, but the service was not great.  There were only a couple of other groups in there and no one checked on us or offered to refill our drinks.  The prices are reasonable for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"Tasty food.  Menu is pretty standard, but prepared much better than some other restaurants.  Food isnt greasy, salsa is about the best around.  Wait staff is helpful and attentive as well as eager to make you comfortable."}
{"text":"Muy muy bueno!  Place is spotless and service is great. We had the Quesadilla and \"something\" El Pastor.  Both were fantastic!  Even the rice and refried beans were great-usually they are just there to decorate the plate. We will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped for lunch after reading reviews.  The place is clean and adequate.  Service was a bit lacking.  Server never asked how the food was.  When paying our bill the person at the cash register answered his cell phone and it was obviously a personal call.  He didn't say anything to us, just took the money.  My wife ordered the lunch fajita which was pretty good.  I ordered the beef taco salad, not good.  The meat was Luke warm and tasteless.  There was NO seasoning.  Will not return."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food around! The service is great and the fresh margaritas are amazing. Portions are big and the food seems to be very fresh.   Me and my wife have been now coming here once a week for the past few months to have good food and drinks and its a tradition we don't plan on breaking."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try here tonight and were sadly disappointed the prices are way to high, the staff is unfriendly, and the food is mediocre at best, we will never go back, my advice is go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Excelllent food and service! The salsa is great - has a little kick and you can ask for extra spicy too! Lunch servings were large for very reasonable price! Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Definitely not the best Mexican place I have been to. The service was very slow for a Mexican restaurant. The food was not very good and there are many other Mexican restaurants in the area that are much better."}
{"text":"Greatest Mexican we've had outside of Texas. Salsa was fresh but not too spicy. Guacamole was delicious!"}
{"text":"In my opinion, this is the best Mexican restaurant in the Akron area. The chips  are light and crisp and made from half tortillas and served with delicious salsa  that is seasoned just right. The hot salsa, available on request, has a smokey, rich flavor.  The Chipotle Chicken is outstanding! Made with strips of white meat chicken, jalapeños, bacon, and cheese in a spicy sauce. The best Mexican dish I have ever eaten. The Fajitas are also very good; very fresh and plentiful vegetables and NOT swimming in oil like so many other restaurants. The steak is actually flavorful, and not tasteless dry bits, as is often the case.  In five visits, the service has always been remarkably good. Attentive, friendly and responsive to special requests (extra spicy, corn tortillas, spicy sauce, etc.)."}
{"text":"Food was great, service was even better.  atmosphere was perfect for some casual Friday evening Mexican dining. The fajita menu would rival any joint in San Antonio, Tejas.  I particularly enjoyed the sauce covering the retried beans-- not as heavy as is usual, and a titch sweeter! You won't regret the trip!"}
{"text":"Great food and prompt service every time I stop in.  I try something new each time and never disappoints."}
{"text":"Food better than most Mexican in the area! We had a VERY LARGE group that they accommodated! food was good. Service was fast and friendly!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has all the qualities of an enjoyable dining experience: colourful ambience depicting the Mexican culture in a quiet and serence location accompanied by, of course, some great food!  To start off with, I am always sold on a complimentary dish of chips and salsa where the salsa has just the right mix of flavours. I went in for the veggie fajitas and was delighted to see a good quantity of a myriad of colours. The beans and rice were perfectly cooked and the fajitas too had a good spice level to it.   I tried my best to finish this, but eventually had to turn to a to-go for the remainder. One of the  most authentic Mexican I have had in a while and a place which I will definately come back to soon!"}
{"text":"The best Mexican dishes in town. Highly recommend their super burros,  fajita quesadilla, and quesadilla mexicanas.   The tamales are also  some of the best tasting I ever had.  Everything  I've had tastes very fresh,  well seasoned, and tastes like it is made with care.  The staff is very friendly as well. If you are looking for a nice local restaurant with great food,  friendly staff,  and great atmosphere,  this is the place."}
