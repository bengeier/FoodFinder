{"text":"Nice and clean little cafe, perfect for breakfast."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, especially when I don't feel like racing to the commisarry, fast food or chow hall! Give yourself 15 minutes though, everything is cooked to order.  Use the services on base! They'll disappear if you don't!"}
{"text":"I remember years ago when this place was the number one spot for Breakfast when I stayed at the nellis in years ago. My how they have changed. The menu is non existent, I came in looking for options and three types of burritos were all that was written on the chalkboard, yet they only had 1 by he time I came in. I wondered why. To my amazement it's because they microwave wave them. Well for the price I could got to the commissary and by a pack that I could microwave myself. The mocha latte was just awful. Just tasted bland. I will not be going here unless I'm hung over and just need anything to fill my stomach"}
{"text":"Convenient cafe within the main lodging building here at Nellis.  They serve 3 variety's of breakfast burritos from 0600-1200.  Sausage, bacon and specialty.  We got in at 1030 and they only had sausage left... meh.  The burritos were a decent size and we're only $3.25 but only consisted of cheese, sausage chunks and \"square\" eggs?  Tasted exactly how I imagined, nothing special.  They do offer a small Starbucks menu and i did notice a lot of people ordering Starbucks drinks, which seems like a big hit.  I'll try and come earlier next time to get a better feel for everything they offer."}
{"text":"The breakfast here was so delicious!  The burritos and breakfast biscuits  were to die for!  As you can see I'm using past tense, since they no longer serve breakfast here!  :( so disappointing!"}
{"text":"Starbucks coffee is convenient for the Nellis Inn residents, however, the food quality has dropped significantly from what it once was.   They used to cook breakfast burritos from scratch, but now you get a microwaveable burrito for the same it used to cost you."}
{"text":"Decent place to grab some quick food or coffee if you are staying at the Main Nellis Inn. They mainly focus on breakfast time."}
