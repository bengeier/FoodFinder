I have to admit the looks of this place isn't exactly adorable or luxurious, but it's a cozy late night hang out. Their food tastes so good and it's so darn cheap! 
They have a combo menu where you can choose how many dishes you want. $15 dinner combo for 2 dishes, $22 combo for 3 dishes..etc. If you're out late or if your pregnant wife is suddenly craving for chinese food.. Yeah this place is the place to go. 

We often come here on a Saturday night and order either the 2 or 3 dish combo. Their sweet and sour pork chop is amazing. Flooded with sauce and crispy. Oh yum. Sizzling plate satay beef is our next order dish. Lots of flavour! Then theres the fried fish with soya sauce, it's so crispy! And there's also the bean curd with fish. These are our main order dishes every time we go. Each dish is full of flavour (not too salty), a down cooked to perfection. The meal always comes with soup to begin and dessert to end the night. Awesome place, so awesome we brought my parents and my bf's parents here. They are picky eaters ad they loved the food. 

Service is hit or miss, literally. They're not the super professional & happy polite type servers. They're more of the \"hey long time no see. Take a seat\" type workers. Kinda makes you feel comfortable. So if you're looking for some fancy restaurant to eat, this ain't your place! And not the type of place to take your girlfriend on a date either ;)"}
{"text":"If you wake up in the middle of the night and you has this Chinese food urge?

If you party till 3 AM and you are drunk and hungry?

Midland Court Restaurant maybe the place for you.

Prices are average, Food are average.. But at 3 AM? What else do you expect?

$14 for a choice of 2 dishes from this huge menu..

The chicken and the beef we got were just off.. too salty, too saucy...too dry... just not too good!

Friendly staffs though... Maybe you can ask for some Cold Tea next time!

I think I rather go to sleep on an empty stomach!

Special thanks to my friend that ate everything as I hate to see food going to waste!"}
