{"text":"I had my heart set on some hot wings on this particular day, we had just come out of the movies and I wanted to eat..we were headed to another restaurant when we saw this place and they invited us in at a discounted price...I saw that they also served wings so I was sold! we walked in and the atmosphere was very comfortable, they attended to us right away bought us some chips and salsa, we ordered some Horchata and some other drinks to start, the staff is very attentive, we ordered the wings, they were pretty good...they had a kick to them! we also had a cinnamon bun for desert, everything is homemade here so we had to wait a little for the desert but it was worth the wait...I will definitely come back and eat here again. we want to try the Mexican sushi that they have."}
{"text":"Ever go to a restaurant and you want something different than your family and the kids just want a burger? THIS IS THE PLACE! You can have a Gyro, wife can have sushi,  and the kids can have the burger.  What other place gives these options?  Food is excellent,  service is attentive,  I did not experience any language barrier,  and the owner even asked how my food was.   Must try.  To bad I live in Gilbert but definitely the place to eat in Avondale! Must try."}
{"text":"Coming to this place for the first time was a good decision. We were greeted and told to sit where ever we liked. The gal that served us was nice and appearance was respectable. Very comfortable atmosphere.  We were given salsa and chips. The salsa was very yummy. Only wish the chips were warm....but that's just me.  With all the good it turned into great when it came to the food. Husband ordered chicken burrito came w/ a large side of rice and beans. Was DELICIOUS!  I ordered sushi, Sonoran I believe it was called.... had so many new flavors that I had not had in a sushi roll. All the new flavors were good still.   I highly recommend this place... this coming from a very picky person."}
{"text":"When they say international, they mean international. They have a HUGE variety of foods. We ordered the shrimp ceviche, Las Vegas rolls, California roll & 2 gyros. The staff was very attentive and I'm excited to come back and try something different!"}
{"text":"I honestly was not that impressed with the food and the food was also over priced. The menu are online is NOT the menu the have at the restaurant so they didn't have a wide variety of food. There was a language barrier, which made it hard for the server to understand us because he didn't speak English. We probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Delicious vegas roll and the limonada was very refreshing! Awesome atmosphere and super friendly, attentive service. Live mariachi music too! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The menu is over complicated, not sure of the countries the food is from.  The waitress did not know the menu and could not educate us. I was in the mood for sushi, but the were not serving sushi or Persian food. Decided to go with chicken Alfredo, the chicken was over cooked and the pasta was salty. When we asked for our check, the waitress waited for me to sign and hand it back to her. The idea of the restaurant is cool, we thought it was going to be divided by countries or something. I would not go back."}
{"text":"Absolutely great!!! Came in with my family, we had Mexican-styled sushi, shrimp, fajitas, and horchata. We recommend it all. The service is super friendly and attentive. We feel at home here. Will definitely keep coming back. They have mariachi on Fridays!"}
{"text":"International Bistro is located in Westgate between the Outlet Mall and the Stadium. The menu they offer is truly is all over the place as they are trying to please everyone. The menu is very large with lots of pages. They offer Persian, Mexican, Chinese, Cooked and uncooked Mexican Sushi, Pizza, Italian, American and perhaps more! The restaurant is comfortable to dine in with two dining rooms of booths and tables and with a patio for outdoor dining.   Our waitress greeted us with complimentary chips and salsa. The salsa was very unique and tasty. It was laced with celery flavor and I noticed sumac on the table as a condiment. This is a red light to me and I figure I must try Persian Food.  I ordered Chicken Barg Sultani. It turned out to be an extremely generous platter of a large marinated white meat chicken kabob and a very generously sized marinated and seasoned ground beef grilled kabob. The meats were prepared to perfection and both were oozing with juice and delicious flavor. Off to the sides of the kabobs were a nicely roasted tomato and a very big pile of fluffy saffron rice. These kabobs really were excellent. They are similar but do differ from Lebanese Style and do have different flavors.  I tasted a piece of my husband's hot skillet dish of Chicken Picado. Just like the other plate the chicken seemed like quality chicken that was prepared deliciously and with expert preparation. This dish was delicious and consisted of Grilled Chicken with onions, tomatoes, jack cheese, a green chile, house made tortillas, refried beans and fluffy rice.  At the time of this review (3-12-17) this restaurant is newly opened and might be working out some things along the way...........  For one the food was WORTH WAITING FOR but did take a long time to prepare. Over a half hour wait at lunch time.  The menu may be written with some misunderstandings as I ordered Chicken Barg Sultani under the Chicken page on the menu and received a beef koobideh. We did tell the manager we were expecting the koobideh to be chicken. Then we found out that koobidehs are usually beef. He graciously brought us a koobideh made with chicken and it was so succulent like all the proteins we tried but still this was difficult to understand reading the menu.  Portions are generous... and some are more than generous.... (happy dance...I got yummy leftovers)  Over all VERY GOOD!  I like that they offer something unique in a nice environment. I felt very welcome to dine here. The owner or manager was extremely hospitable and International Bistro is a highly recommended restaurant to visit if you are at Westgate.  I just need to note that this restaurant is newly opened so it's expected that they might be working some things out."}
{"text":"I am willing to bet that at least have of these reviews are fake and from the owners themselves. This place is trash and struggles to find itself. International Bistro...that doesn't sound appealing to the average consumer. The menu had over 200 items! That ridiculous! They clearly don't know what they're doing! They're overthinking themselves which is costing them big time! Menu's for small business's should be small to keep up the quality and consistency. When me and my friend walked in for the first time, no one greeted us, I GREETED THE WAITRESS for fucc's sake. Then she had a slight attitude as well when I told her to give me a minute when I was looking at the menu. Like holy crap, didn't know I had to read the Bible in 5 minutes and know what I immediately wanted to order. The decor is nice but it's so extremely out of place with the style of food (which is almost everything) and the music. It was a playlist consisting of pop and rancherias and latin pop. So bland. Me and my friend got a surf n turf roll and it was actually quite nice, I'll give them that. Didn't like how the carrots were prepared though, they are trying to hard to be fancy and premium. They don't know the demographic, it's a plaza where families come to have a good time at the movies and get some brunch while they're at it, not where Tim Cook comes to eat dinner. This place is just sad and recently the plaza shut them down, I wonder why? OH YEAH. THEY CLOSED NEARLY EVERYDAY BECAUSE THEY WERE LOSING MONEY. They were to oblivious to see that, they themselves, were running themselves into the ground. They even spent money to advertise on Yelp. My uncles restraint spends $300 to do that on this app, it's getting these International Bumbs nothing. Sad to see this happen to a new business but cmon, it doesn't take rocket science to know who to run a successful small business. Pathetic."}
{"text":"This restaurant treated me and my big family very well! Excellent staff and the best food I've had in a long time. I recommend!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I saw this was new in our area and decided to try it.  We came in and the two of us were seated at a four person table that was setup for six. Needless to say I pushed the chairs away so we could actually be comfortable and had to stack the plates on the table to have any room. The menu was huge and or waitress seemed nice she checked on us a few times while we were looking, there was only one other person eating when we got there and one other couple came in while we were looking at the menu. Finally we made our choice and our waitress was nowhere to be found,  until we saw her walk out and get into a car and leave. Another waitress had come in and she was walking around in the front not aware that is nor the other couple had ordered. I made eye contact with her and she realised no one was being helped.  She came over and took our order and then the other tables. I ordered \"fresh\" guacamole that turned out to be anything but fresh,  and chicken tacos. The guacamole came out fairly quick and had a dark green color which is not common if made fresh.  The flavor was heavy with salt and citrus, both will help keep guacamole for longer. When my tacos arrived they had no cheese on them or Pico which was in the description, but they did have the avocado puree on them which wad identical to the fresh guacamole. The three tacos were plated sitting in the refried beans, so eating them was very messy.  The rice,  I don't even know what to think here,  it smelled and tasted like it had rubbing alcohol in it.  I thought I was crazy so my girlfriend tasted it with out me saying what I thought it was, the first thing out of her mouth was rubbing alcohol. This made me scared to eat any more of the other food.  I did with reluctance and the chicken had a good flavor but was kind of dry, the beans were soupy and lacking in flavor. My waitress came over and I told her about the rice.  I lifted a spoonful up for her to smell.  She agreed with us and said that maybe the kitchen staff had not properly cleaned the rice cooker after using a disinfectant.  She said she would go tell the kitchen to throw it out.  Without going directly to the kitchen she returned a minute later with our check and no attempt to try and fix the rice issue.  We paid and as we left we noticed the other couple had a huge pile of uneaten rice as well. We were happy to see a new place local to us and such a large menu to choose from but we will not be returning."}
{"text":"First time visiting this place and did not like it one bit. 1st off they didn't honor their promotion on restaurant.com.  I was suppose to get $25 off on a $50 tab. The waitress and manager seem to not know the promotion. He had to call the owner, Frank, which he didn't honor the deal. Instead, he offered me 20% off I was like that's not the same as the promotion. Their food is way over priced. They say they sell sushi but it's not on the menu. This place just opened get it together Int'l Bistro"}
{"text":"This place just opened...still have their \"Grand Opening\" sign up...and, they're closed.  Not sure why, just heard they're moving somewhere else.  How do you do that?  A place is all set up, opens, then just closes!!  Was it a month-to-month rental???"}
{"text":"It had great service and the food was exceptional. The fried sushi was very good. Salsa was nice and hot!!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a delicious meal, the waitress was very attentive and prompt. Nice experience, pleasant atmosphere and highly recomended!"}
