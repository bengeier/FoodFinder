{"text":"Super Tasty! Quite close the Renaissance hotel and Rue Saint-Catherine, and while it is only open for lunch during the week, it was so worth it! The decor is nice and authentically Swiss :)! Attentive service and the vegetarian rosti was extremely tasty - the cheese, vegetables and potatoes made an amazing combination. The house salad was also quite tasty with pickled vegetables and a fresh dressing. Would definitely recommend going here!"}
{"text":"We were simply delighted with out experience here. The owner was a stupendous host. He really made our evening! Besides the hospitality, the meal was fantastic. Everything was fresh, delicious, and beautifully presented. The atmosphere was charming and cozy. You will not be disappointed - visit!"}
{"text":"Une tres bonne adresse de restaurant suisse a Montreal. La fondue suisse est vraiment succulente"}
{"text":"Delightful and quiet place.  Great and authentic Swiss fondue.  Family owned and run, don't expect 5 star service with tablecloths.  Simple and only a few items on menu.  Fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Very nice cauliflower soup and rosti.  We tried both the rosti of the day as well as the mushroom rosti.  Both came with arugula and slivers of cheese.  Delicious with the house wine."}
{"text":"I was here for dinner with friends and i found a dead fly in my plate. I took it out from my plate.. i was disgusted.. i told the manager and they changed my plate but i lost my appetite.. what a horrible dinner..and i paid full bill!  I wouldn't comeback - do not recommend-"}
{"text":"Wonderful service and excellent food. Beautifully thought-out menu. Excellent options for vegetarians. Have been on many occasions and plan on going back many more.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This quaint little restaurant is wonderful. We came in and had the pizzy cheese. This breaded Swiss cheese is slowly browned to create a creamy center and just crisp exterior. Amazing delicate flavors, a true must have for cheese lovers. We followed with a vegetable rosti. Roasted vegetables with potatoes, similar to a hash brown sliced potato, and goat cheese topped with a perfectly poached egg on top. The seasoning and flavor combos were amazing. We finished with the Toblerone mousse and espresso. It's a good thing that it's a bit of a walk back to the hotel. Come in and enjoy a taste of Laussane Switzerland nestled in this amazing Quebec city."}
{"text":"Very impressed with this charming and authentic restaurant. I searched on Yelp for fondue places in Montreal, looking to try something new.   My friend and I had some nice garden salads and then shared an Alpine fondue and a raclette.   Our servers and the owner were very attentive and kind, checking on us often an ensuring that we were well situated. We were even offered some complimentary limoncello at the end of our meal and the owner chatted with us at length about the restaurant and his Swiss heritage.  The garden salad was very nice, with a good assortment of veggies, especially some delicious pickled onions. The fondue was very traditional. A portion for one would be fine to share as an appetizer or a light meal. The raclette for one was nicely sized for sharing as well.   The meal was a bit pricer than I was expecting, but it definitely lived up to my standards for fondue in Montreal!"}
{"text":"plussieurs visites:les établissement A rösti ne sont pas légion A montreal) cadre sobre,mais la touche Suisse est bien présente.proprio sur les lieux et qui surveille la bonne marche de l'entreprise.fondue/raclette sont au r-v,mais d'autres plats ne manquent pas.service sans faute.le fendant est là aussi.pour conclure:plus que correct et à la moitié du prix de l'auberge de saviese(Resto touristique à geneve)"}
{"text":"Tasty but small portion. Friendly service but imo not worth the money they charge for for what you get"}
{"text":"Delicious Food, great place to go with a group of friends, family or even on a date. It's not the cliche stereotypical Swiss chalet, they serve fine delicate meals but if you'd still like to have a fondue this the place to go! I love the fact that they are environmentally conscious and only get products from local suppliers and last but not least the owner is the friendliest person ever! For all the Swiss out there, le Léman is really a home away from home and for all the others it's just a good opportunity to eat well and have fun!"}
{"text":"I cannot believe this gem does not have more reviews.  Discovered this Swiss restaurant today for a work lunch. It was full on a Tuesday for lunch.  Beautiful bright restaurant, attentive service. Perfect mini ciabatta with the meal.  I had a wonderful meal, which worked together. I would have been hungry had I ordered less. Potato leek soup Beet, goat cheese and tempura squash  I was also checking out what was said to be great gravlax with rosti. Might have that or fondue next time. There will definitely be a next time. :)"}
{"text":"Notre déjeuné fut des meilleurs avec de la charcuterie des montagnes, des saveurs authentiques et une cave des plus fournies en matière de cépages suisses, importation privée, très appréciée.  Un morceau de Suisse dans votre assiette. Le service était attentionné et efficace, un serveur plutôt beau garçon et le propriétaire, lui-même en salle. En arrière plan des paysages suisses... Un morceau de Suisse dans votre cur.  Une halte de midi que nous aimerions bien tester sur un souper avec une bonne fondue aux fromages... Affaire à suivre!"}
