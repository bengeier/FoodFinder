{"text":"I like Dilworth Coffee and I'm glad it's in the community. It has a casual and friendly feel, and the coffee is always great; the baked goods I have tried here have always been enjoyable as well. There's a variety of personality among the staff and while one or two don't necessarily give me the warm fuzzies, I'm not really there for a relationship! ;-) To be clear, no one has ever been rude. Anytime I am in the area, I can count on Dilworth to give me good coffee, a generous points program and a spot to sit where I can get some work done. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I like this place , it's special to me , it's like the ambience , coffee n tea , pretty neat !"}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience. The gentleman working at the coffee shop was very accommodating with special requests. Would definitely refer others here and if traveling through the area again, I will be back."}
{"text":"I love it here. You can actually relax, read or meet friends and hear each other when you talk. The Barista's are great. Nice and friendly. BUT.. it is getting run down. Some of the gift card and other machines don't work. They don't have many food options. Always running out of something or other. There are other Dilworth Coffees in various parts of Charlotte, but this one is like Cinderella. The step-sisters have all the Bling. I truly hope this one finds her Prince Charming.... because I like it here."}
{"text":"Oh man. I really do love supporting local coffee shops. And this is based on my last two experiences there. The coffee is decent enough, but the service is really not efficient and really uncool. By uncool, I mean i waited in line 5 minutes with just one other person in front of me. The girl working was talking to another younger girl non stop and then the girls mom walked in paid me no mind and cut right in front of me to order and they all started chatting about engagement rings. I get it we are in the south, life goes a little slower and weddings are a huge topic here. But really all I wanted was a cup of coffee. After almost 10 minutes I was late for a conference call hadn't even been helped and had to leave. I would love to see a local spot do well so maybe the management should talk to the younger staff about how to serve customers more efficiently"}
{"text":"Barista was great.  I asked for a Macchiato (italian style - not like SBucks).  After two clarifying questions she nailed it.  Foam was great, shots were blah.  Her attitude and the fact Dilworth is independent is worth 2.5 stars.     Fluorescent lighting kills atmosphere but plenty of comfy seats.  4 brewed coffees and Rancilio (vs super auto espresso machine) implies the owner is at least trying."}
{"text":"This place is a no frills coffeehouse that offers coffee flavors of the day and specialty lattes/macchiatos/etc and because of that be expected to pay a slightly higher price for your cup o' joe.  They also have a case filled with various pastries and yogurt. I personally would recommend skipping out on the pastries because they always look like they're a day (or two) old. However, the baristas are always friendly and helpful.  I'll occasionally stop here because of its proximity to my job but I don't find their coffee to be that special to make this place a regular spot but I do enjoy popping in here and there to see the seasonal flavor offerings."}
{"text":"The barista was very friendly and helpful. That's about it. I bought some cookies and cakes for my kids. They were tasteless and stale, like they had been sitting in the case for ages. The coffee was nothing special. Definitely overpriced. I am all for supporting local instead of the big chains, but if you're going to charge big chain prices, what you're selling better be exceptional."}
{"text":"Employees are always friendly and helpful. Tasty coffee and pastries, fast service, clean and comfortable environment. It's really the only coffee shop serving the Afton Village/Poplar Tent community, but it would stand up well against other coffee shops in Cabarrus County."}
{"text":"ok. let's start with the good. plenty of parking since the place sits in a shopping center. decent amount of seating inside. mostly tables. a small section of lounge chair type furniture. small seating area outside on the side. 3 tables with 4 chairs a piece. it's actually fenced off really nicely so it feels like you are on a backyard deck. drink menu is small and standard. hot, cold, coffee, tea. all reasonably priced. i went with the dark roast drip and it was better than expected. smooth with no trace of stale carafe taste. they also have a light and house blend available in drip. went with a double chocolate chip muffin. very very flavorful and moist. one staff member working this day and she was very pleasant and efficient. bathroom was one at a time style. cabinet was stocked with toilet paper and paper towels. YES! well lit and pretty clean and fairly modern.   ok, just two not so goods. no music playing which made me feel self conscious of my voice when ordering and made the place feel stagnate. pastry selection was weak! three different styles of danish which looked suspiciously like Costco or Sam's Club product. also, two different flavors of muffins and one bagel.   i might stop back in if i'm in the area again."}
{"text":"Great coffee great service nice people coffee people excellent I got the dark roast it was great I would like to see choc powder maybe I missed it"}
{"text":"I love this place. Locally and great customer service and there's always good coffees to grab. I miss their old location because it was cozier but this one is also just as great. Support local business!"}
{"text":"The coffee is better than Starbucks! The seating could be a lot nicer. Just needs so updates but it's great coffee."}
