{"text":"Just tried Mi Familia for the first time.... Loved it!"}
{"text":"Inconsistent. I may sound sexist, but I've only gotten good food and service here when the middle aged man was working. When he's on, the food is perfectly cooked, the sauce is thick , the salsa is thick, and you'll actually get a refill if needed. Otherwise, expect poor service, bad, overcooked food and a lack of over all consistency.  My chicken quesadilla was awesome when the guy made it, had sauce and a nice whipped sour cream, otherwise it's a bland tortilla with salsa on the side."}
{"text":"Okay, I live right down the street from this place and had such hope for it. I took my mom and sister there one night and all that hope was just completely run over by a truck. Their prices are great though! I ordered an enchilada and got a burrito. Actually, none of us got what we ordered. And that was after waiting for close to an hour for our food to be ready. But it looked good so I decided to just go for it. I did like the sauce, but everything after that was just horrible, overcooked, dry, and flavorless. I couldn't even finish the thing. Maybe it was just an off night? It was disappointing though. If you choose to try this place, I recommend calling your order in ahead of time and checking your order before you leave."}
{"text":"I stopped by earlier to satisfy my craving for some tacos. The cashier suggested I order the Asada Plate instead, since it was only $1 more. I took his advice and was not disappointed.   The beef was seasoned and cooked perfectly. It came with tortillas, rice and beans. The cost was $8.99 +tax.   I will mos def come back to try their Tripe Tacos."}
{"text":"Im from california and went to vegas with some friends. I ws on a search for mexican food as and was driiving around in N. Las Vegas and saw this lil restauraunt. I was really happy to say that it was so nice to be at an authentic restauraunt that was not a buffet! I would definetely eat here again the Carnitas tacos were so yum!"}
{"text":"I've gotten food from here twice. Experienced good customer service however the food taste bland. Not sure if the food is made \"fresh\" or to order. I ordered a side of Spanish rice and the lady put a ziploc bag of rice in the microwave (that I had to wait 5 minutes for). I would rather drive down the street to Roberto's for Mexican food."}
{"text":"I live nearby, and my husband sends me for tacos regularly. I am a big fan of the carnitas plate. I won't pretend to be an expert on authentic Mexican food, but It is delicious and family-owned. The people are generally friendly, and they prepare the food fresh.   Sometimes I feel like an intruder because I'm a pasty white girl ordering in English, but the food is worth a little self consciousness!  It's not really a destination kind of restaurant, but an awesome little neighborhood place amidst a serious lack of good food choices in eastern North Las Vegas."}
{"text":"our family goes there about 3 times a month if not more the food is delicious and not bad in price! the carne asada burrito is good especially if u ask for wet burrito!"}
{"text":"Super pumped to find this little family ran Mexican restaurant. Needed some good food and not regular chain stuff."}
{"text":"I first spotted this place out the corner of my eye while craving for some carne asada fries.  I was on my way to Roberto's but this place was closer to my house so I decided to try it. It's a small little little spot like any other mexican food joint, the food was ok, the price was a little more expensive than other joints like Roberto's. Either way it was just okay I guess. I still think Felipito's on Tropicana is the best mexican food spot in Vegas, price, quantity, and taste."}
{"text":"Like the family owned business and I'm all for mom and pops places.. Bt I have to say its totally greasy..... Sorry not again...."}
{"text":"I love this place.  It is hard to find authentic mexican food that tastes so good in North Las Vegas.  I love all of their food.  They also have delicious orchata.  They are reasonably priced and are very nice."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: LAME Cooks: Are real Mexicans - that' s a plus I guess - but they are NOT good cooks Food: Tasteless Price: deceptive price menu and too much for too little It also smelled bad in there - does that mean that buy really cheap low grade meat?  Not sure, but the smell was a little scary.  Ummm not sure why there are any good reviews for this place. We are constantly going to authentic Mexican restaurants all over various areas, esp California.  This restaurant is not authentic Mexican.  I'm not sure what it is.  But it's not good.  The carna asada, which is my favorite, was not carna asada here.  It tasted like lightly salted meat.  The salsa was way too smokey and it had almost no pleasant flavor.  The horchata was good, that was the ONLY thing that was good and that's what gets the one star.  A friend of ours (who is Mexican) wanted to check this place out because it's right down the street from us and the menu that they sent out in the mail made their prices look really great.  The menu is totally deceiving.  They have a picture of a plate of 3 carna asada tacos with the price 1.29 on it (or something like that) and when you get there you order 3 plates of the three little carna asada tacos and it came out to a little over $13.00?  What do you call that?  Deceiving.  We know of a much better place and it's much cheaper - not that we are going for cheap, because we are not, we are going for honest advertising, authentic yummy food.  And this place simply doesn't have that!  Our Mexican friend ordered his favorite orange drink.  Although it was pulled out of the little fridge next to the register, the soda was warm.  There was no one there, either the fridge doesn't work or they stock rarely and slowly.        ALTERNATIVE PLACE TO GO TO: Taqueria Arandas   2040 North Nellis Boulevard, Las Vegas, NV (702) 452-7313   - This place is the bomb digity!  Totally Authentic Mexican food (WOOOOWW -  atmosphere is ok, but WHO CARES, the food is so stinking good!!! and the prices are amazing!!!!)"}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place! They are so friendly & honest, the food is always freshly prepared and great tasting. Our favorite is the carne asada nachos! We go 2-3x a month! Simple: honest, nice and friendly staff who may not remember my name but certainly do remember my family and i's faces!"}
{"text":"This place is closed!!! Drove here for nothing!!! Waste of time!!! Looks like a dump anyways. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Not  a fancy place, but a place that has menudo everyday and outstanding homemade tortillas on the weekends. Burritos come with everything inside but they will put the beans and rice on the side. Great prices and great food, we eat there a couple times a week."}
{"text":"I come here for the tacos and the sopes.  This place is nice and simple.  I think they are best for their tacos."}
{"text":"I love this place but they are kind of like \"catch us if you can\" ...sometimes they are open sometimes they're just NOT. But you never know.  We had chile relleno plate, carne asada plate, torta and taquitos. Beans and rice were a little cold but very good other than that."}
{"text":"I love, love, love their chips and salsa. The carne asada burrito is tasty along with the carnitas tacos. Yeah, the restaurant itself isn't fancy schmancy, but it gets the job done and fills my belly- making me a happy chappy!"}
{"text":"I've searched for some real authentic Mexican cooking for a while in north vegas, and this place does the job great!  The tacos, the fish, the burritos, even the quesadillas are on point and prices are not bad."}
{"text":"So my coworker went to Mi familia and told me there's this little Mexican place next to a gas station kind of hidden away and the food is good!  A bunch of us decide to go after work and try it out. You walk in and you see the big menu hanging and they also have little menus you can pick up and then order. There's tables but it isn't a super big place. They also have a TV.  Now for the food. After placing our orders we sit down and they bring out some tortilla chips and salsa. The salsa has just the right amount of hotness. I ordered a chimichanga steak/asada and it was literally the largest chimichanga I have ever had. It had the guacamole and other sauces over it. Inside had the steak, asada, rice, beans. The chimichanga was so good! It took me a little while to eat it all. I also ordered the horchata smoothie. Yes you heard me right a horchata smoothie! I don't know why places don't do horchata smoothies because they are so awesome. They also do breakfast dishes which I will have to try in the future!  I give 3 stars for good food and good service. If you go and you like horchata then you have to get a horchata smoothie!"}
