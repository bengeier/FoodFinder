{"text":"I understand this place was formerly Folino's Brother's Pizza and has since changed ownership, I believe.  I recently moved back to the South Hills from the city and found their ad with some coupons for a wing/pizza special.  Sometimes everyone needs a night to stay in and order some pizza, so we tried it out.  The delivery was quick and the price was affordable.

We ordered a pepperoni pizza and dry-rub wings.  The wings. were. outstanding.  They were good quality and didn't have the slimy skin that some wings have from soppy sauce or poor frying.  I was really pleased with the Cajun flavoring.  Our pizza was just okay, but I would (and have) ordered it again because it was enjoyable with the wings.  Instead of the pepperoni we prefer Nobby's sausage and green peppers with our pizza.

BE SURE to order wings on a Tuesday because they run a .50 special! It's really work it to try them out. I promise I would never mislead you about wings!"}
{"text":"Ordered a large pizza and decided to call back and  add an Italian hoagies to my order.  The person taking the order said it would be 20 minutes before my order would be ready. I arrived 20 minutes later to pick up my order. Drove home approximately 5 minutes away, when I got home I opened the pizza which was still piping hot and was very good as it usually is from Nobby's. Unfortunately I can not say the same about the hoagie, Even though I just ordered it 20 minutes prior to getting it home I could tell that it was not just made fresh. The lettuce was extremely soggy and translucent meaning that it had been sitting on the bread for a long period of time, the bread was crumbling and flaking off. I can not believe that Nobby's would risk losing a customer by selling food that had been sitting around. Ovisously someone else had ordered a hoagie and not picked it up amd Nobby's figured that they could get rid if it by selling it to me. I paid over $11 for the hoagie that was not editable. I did not waste my time calling to complain, figured I would just take my business another business that values customers. To be fair I have not had any issues in the past ordering from Nobby's, but customer service counts for me"}
{"text":"I don't generally expect much when I order delivery from a restaurant, mostly I'm just hoping for edible food. Nobby's hits it out of the park with their pizza and their bread sticks as well. The bread sticks were light and slightly spongey (incredible texture) the included marinara was sweet with enough tanginess from tomatoes to make the sweetness light a pleasant rather than overpowering. The pizza (I got traditional pepperoni) was delicious, the crust looked thinner than I typically like on a pizza (there was a thicker crust option but I wanted to try the standard first) but I was pleasantly surprised with the crust and I would definitely order it standard again, the sauce was nicely sweet and tangy and the crust around the end wasn't hard as a rock like I'm used to with most pizza orders, cheese was melted perfect also. Lastly, the delivery driver was really polite and professional even though my house is a pain to find so that was awesome. Overall I give the meal in particular a 5/5 as well as Nobby's a 5/5. First impressions are everything for me when it comes to food and Nobby's really knocked it out of the park for me so I definitely look forward to ordering again and trying something else on their menu."}
{"text":"Ordered Nobby's for carryout and was overall pretty pleased. I have tried about 5 different south hills Pittsburgh pizza shops (Franco's, Pizza Co., EM Pizza, etc) in the last month and Nobby's was up there. I had a offer letter for a salad, bread sticks, pizza, and a soda, and I'm quite pleased with the amount of food that I received for the price. 

Their pizza is thin, which I knew going in, and overall I enjoyed the flavor. Personally, Taste wise I think I'd give it an 8 out 10, and I will be back."}
{"text":"Placed an order for pickup.  Employee said it would be 25 minutes.  Show up 25 minutes later and the kid working the place had not even started making the pizza.   There was another guy there obviously waiting far past his pickup time as well.   The place was dead, it was 8:30 on a thursday night,  one table of people eating.   Cancelled my order when the kid reached into the cooler to start my pizza.   What a joke.  

Don't bother going here.  Don't waste your gas/time."}
{"text":"I'm from New York so of course I'm picky about the pizza I eat (I have high standards). Nobby's makes some of the best pizzas I've had in Pittsburgh. They deliver, which is nice, and they usually have some kind of coupon deal going on. There was only one time something went wrong with the delivery but they fixed it lightening fast. This is my preferred pizza place in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Nobby's pizza was great. I really like their pizza and the staff was so friendly. Also the pizza was big."}
{"text":"Super good pizza. Tastes like a blend between Fioris and Mineos pizzas if you have ate at either of those places."}
{"text":"I ordered from Nobby's for the first time tonight. Service was fast, delivery person was smiling and professional and the food... Fantastic! Ordered a meatball Parmesan hoagie that was the best I've ever tasted. Sauce, meat, cheese and roll were all delicious and fresh. 
The chicken Caesar salad was full of grilled chicken that was cooked perfectly. I will be ordering again. I was glad that they were willing to deliver to Mt. Lebanon! Glad I tried this great restaurant."}
{"text":"Daughter has admitted this is pizza with flair. I'm usually not a pizza person, but I decided if we were to order pizza, I would not go with the national chains. I called in my order before getting off work, so as soon as I left work I could pick up the food, and eat at home.
 
Since this was a first try with Nobby's, I got the large half pepperoni, half extra cheese, and a 10 piece order of mild buffalo wings. The crust is nice, crispy, and has a taste like it's not just put into any old oven. The balance of sauce, and cheese was nice, I was almost thinking NYC style. Pepperoni wasn't paper thin, which I appreciated too.

The wings were fried to a good crisp, and the mild buffalo sauce was just a great balance of kick, and tasty, nothing to set on fire. If I do say, I think the wings might've been a little overdone, since the meatier pieces seemed to be a bit tough. And the wings were carefully wrapped which I appreciated, the drive home proved to be a bit chaotic, but the seats showed no evidence of my pizza/wing Friday night feast. 
Will remember Nobby's the next time I hear someone thinking of pizza."}
{"text":"The people that knock this place do so when the staff is short handed. Sometimes I notice there is only one guy handling all orders. I am a frequent customer and so are my coworkers and the place never lets you down. Sure they have been times I waited maybe 5 minutes more then the usual time they gave me for my order to be ready, but who cares. The food is all worth it in my opinion. 

Prices are fair as well and the staff is kind."}
{"text":"I am always looking for a new pizza place and using groupon deals is perfect for this purpose.

I had a groupon for 1 large cheese pizza, an order of wings, and breadsticks. The worker that answered the phone had no idea what was offered on the groupon. 

I carefully gave them my order and repeated it slowly 3 times because I no confidence that they would get it right due to the guys confusion. 

I ordered salami on half of my pizza, wings with sauce on the side and breadsticks for takeout. These were the items included with the groupon. 

FIrst, there was NO salami on my pizza. 

Second, the wing sauce was on the wings and not on the side. When I placed the order, I explained that I wanted the sauce on the side because the wings get too soggy. I also order blue cheese with the wings and was given ranch.  

Third, when i went in to get my order, they forgot to make the breadsticks and had to make them  as I waited.

They made mistakes on every single item I ordered. I didn't bother calling, it just wasn't worth it. I will not ever place an order with them again."}
{"text":"Very good pizza with a sweet sauce.  Awesome prices and fast delivery!  Use the pizza perks and it's gives great rewards!"}
{"text":"The dry rub wings are AMAZING.  The first time I tried them, I had to try to get every last bit out of the container.  I have even ordered them to go to take back with me since I live in another state - they were so good I had to share.  Oh, and the wings were so big with lots of meat on them and juicy and flavorful ....they just don't make them like this back where I'm from. 

The people at Nobby's were very hardworking and helpful as well.  Very positive experience.   Some people might not realize that delivery means the driver has to drive a lot of winding roads through traffic so plan ahead, order ahead of time if you want it for a certain time - but it's oh so worth it!!!  Yep, this is on my list of favorites."}
{"text":"We wanted to like this pizza after receiving a nice ad in the mail. We were quoted 45 minutes, and I called at 65 after no order was delivered. They asked my address and name multiple times, could not recall the order, and didn't know where it was. The ordered arrived ten minutes later and the pizza was cold. The salad was brown and pink edged, so we threw it away. We were very disappointed overall."}
{"text":"Mediocre hoagies. Couldn't pay me to eat the pizza. We order because we live literally within walking distance of the place so it's convenient. Today we were tired from work and ordered 2 hoagies....it look FIFTY minutes and both hoagies were cold.i can see your store from my house yet your delivery boy callaled to tell me he's coming from dormont and can't remember our address. Never, ever again."}
{"text":"Ordered here for the first time on mon, pizza was one of the best i've had in a long time, big plus that they have GREEN olives as a topping, prob my fave with bacon & onions, italian hoagie wasn't bad either, wings were ok"}
{"text":"This was a top notch pizza pie and I'm very glad I ordered from Nobby's. Most pizzas around here are too doughy and have a poor, generic taste. But Nobby's was thin with a slightly crispy crust, a great flavor profile and excellent toppings. It was so fresh when it arrived the cheese started sliding off the first piece (that means you should give it five minutes or so to \"set\"...which I didn't care about so I burned the roof of my mouth). It was too delicious to stop eating it! Even the crust at the end was delicious, so I'd say this pizza deserves it's \"Best Pizza Shop\" in the region award from the Trib a couple of years ago.

What really struck me was my order of wings from Nobby's, which raised my opinion of the place even higher. I got the standard mild buffalo flavor, and I expected the usual grouping of wings coated in the thick orange buffalo sauce that uses a base of Frank's Red Hot. It's good but terribly messy. Apparently I've been suffering under the delusion that this crappy sauce was how you were supposed to make wings, because tonight I had buffalo wings that blew my socks off. They weren't a dry rub, persay, because there was a bit of oil in the bottom of the container you could turn the wings in, but they were crispy and crunchy and honestly the best delivery wings I've had in my whole life.

To be fair, I do think that one other local pizza place in my delivery area outdoes Nobby's by a hair. A'Pizza Badamo is just about a half-star higher in terms of crust, but Nobby's has a wider array of toppings and menu items, so I'd  consider either place comparable depending on what you are craving on any given night."}
{"text":"We received a letter in the mail that stated we should come give their pizza a try. So I took them up on the offer, it seemed like a little man trying to compete with big business. We received a large pizza, a salad, breadstix, and a 2 L for $16.00!! 

Now I know why it was so cheap...

When you walked into this location there was a woman who was cooking and who was the cashier who had no teeth or manners, she took her flour covered hands and used my credit card, then went back to making pizzas.

We received the food, took it back to our place, and it tasted awful. The sauce, cheese, and dough had no flavors what so ever. The pizza was bland. The cheese was most likely a single blend that just honestly tasted like plastic. 

The breadstix included a garlic butter and a red sauce, however they also lacked flavor which in turn made you want to douse them in sauce, which was also flavorless.

The salad was a really good salad, which included a bunch of veggies, however only included one packet of dressing....

Hey at least the 2L was good...

I will probably not ever go back unless I was shown that something had been done to make the pizza taste better (maybe add some herbs and a blend of moz and brick cheese)"}
{"text":"Update 3/26/16:  Bringing the star rating down one notch. The pizza is still pretty bland. Needs something in the sauce--Italian spices perhaps. And the thin crust isn't crispy, and still needs salt..."}
{"text":"Great local place. Pizza is great and the hoagies are amazing. We eat here at least 3 times a month and have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"We ordered on line, extra crispy naked wings. With mild buffalo sauce and buffalo garlic Parmesan sauce on the side. 
The wings were perfectly cooked. The sauces came on the side with a Great twist. The garlic sauce, Parmesan cheese and extra garlic were in separate containers. Along with the buffalo sauce. This allowed us to mix the ingredients to our taste!
Cudos to the cook and packer of our dinner!! 
Also the broccoli cheddar bites, Greek salad and meatball calzone were out of this world!!
Thanks guys!  Great job"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with their customer service. Ordered pizza through GrubHub which we've done before with little issue. Pizza arrived about 20 minutes sooner than the 60 minute quote, wasn't expecting that but yay, we get to eat sooner than expected! We paid through the GrubHub app (including tip) so the driver gave us our food and that was that. 

Literally 2 minutes after the driver leaves we get a call from the restaurant. The guy said, \"Our drivers work for tips, you probably don't know what that's like.\" 
This, of course, caught me off guard. I did tip the driver, in the app, it shows you right on the grub hub receipt. I tell the guy that I did tip online, and instead of apologizing for his rude accusation, he hangs up on me. 

This was the most unprofessional and simply rudest thing I've ever experienced from somebody in the customer service industry. I don't plan on every dealing with these guys again if they treat their customers this way. 

Update: owner messaged me and we talked on the phone. He was very apologetic about the incident. He said this issue is not representative of how they do business and apologized. I have no reason not to believe him. It's a shame how one employee having a bad day can affect how people see a business. Bumped review up to 3 stars for the owner reaching out."}
{"text":"After signing up for their Pizza Perks Program, we took advantage of their free large cheese pizza deal. 

The person we talked to on the phone while ordering was polite, upbeat and helpful. They gave us an estimated delivery time of 40 minutes and it arrived 20 minutes faster. The man who delivered the pizza was also very nice. Overall the customer service was superb. 

The pizza itself was hot upon delivery and smelled delicious. The crust tasted homemade with a chewy center and a crispy outside. The sauce and cheese were well done also. As a whole, the pizza was one of the best we've had in suburban Pittsburgh. 

A free pizza for just signing up for a program was a nice surprise so we cannot say much about the price- we were charged a standard delivery fee. The remainder of their menu seemed moderately priced. 

The only reason we decided on a 4/5 instead of the 5/5 was due to the fact that we only had a cheese pizza. Their menu seems like they have an extensive selection so in the future we are planning on ordering here again."}
{"text":"Killer food, good service, and great prices, what more could you ask for from a small town pizza joint. I highly recommend a visit if you happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"Delicious!  I highly recommend the Italian sausage on pizza, they use ground sausage which is different, and so good!  The waffle fries are always fresh and not soggy when we get them, and the garlic bread is huge and extra crispy.  Absolutely love this place!"}
{"text":"I never write reviews; this place deserves a better rating. Honestly this on one of the better slices I have had in a long time. Nice sweet tomato sauce, I highly recommend it. Crust was nice and crunchy, you could tell it was hand thrown and homemade. Absolutely give this place a try."}
{"text":"We had been to Trader Jacks and we were starving. We stopped in here to have a bite to eat. We had an unusual request because of a food allergy and they were very kind and made us a pizza for the person with the allergy. Their pizza is good but not anything to write home about."}
{"text":"Will not be ordering from Nobby's again. After several messed up orders (chicken ceasar salad missing chicken, greek salad missing dressing, pizza with chicken missing chicken), this event was the final straw. Ordered calzone and fried zucchini with \"marinara\" sauce for takeout. Was eating the zucchini and \"marinara\" and noticed an odd smoky flavor. Halfway through the sauce found what looked like a piece or raw chicken!! It was gross. Called Nobby explained what I found and the kind employee said he would come get it and asked if I wanted anything else. Said no thanks I had lost my appetite. Employee called and said the object was not raw chicken, rather, cooked pork that they now put in their \"marinara\" sauce! What?!? Manager never called to apologize or offer anything. Done!"}
{"text":"With credit left on my Just Pay Half Hot Card dying to be spent and fewer and fewer restaurants accepting them, Kay and I headed to Scott Township to unload some more of it after calling around to see which businesses were still participating in the promotion within a reasonable drive. 

The interiors are minimal, and the staff was genial enough, but the food was simply ho-hum. 

The best part about the Widowmaker \"signature\" pizza I ordered was the outer crust, which pleasantly recalled buttered bread sticks. Aside from that, the pasty sauce was weak, the body of the pizza drooped, and the pile of dry \"meat lover's\" toppings (Italian sausage, ham, capicola, pepperoni, and...black olives?) did little else but attempt to fool me into thinking I was eating a hoagie. A \"unique provolone blend\" made up the cheese portion. I suppose mozzarella's getting too pricey these days. 

The Buffalo Billy Boat read like an interesting submarine, so I went with that, and was greeted by a sloppy, greasy, open-faced boor of a sandwich that was merely filled with chicken cubes,\"wing sauce,\" and more of that provolone with some ranch dressing on the side. In terms of taste, there was nothin' happenin'. Trying to eat it was like mud wrestling with a walrus. 

Kay's Spinach Chicken Salad wasn't a complete snoozer, though. The serving was generous, the proteins were plentiful, and the ingredients were fresh. Nonetheless, Nobby's is one of those suburban secrets that doesn't beckon to be uncovered in my opinion. The food mostly goes nowhere. 

P.S. Nobby's delivers to Mt. Lebanon, Cedarhurst, Scott Township (duh!), Heidelberg, Bridgeville and parts of Carnegie if yinz care, and you shouldn't.

P.P.S. Our tab came to about $30. Ooof!

P.P.P.S. The name of the street Nobby's is on is metal. I'm jealous. My street sounds like an old lady's name.

{"text":"Stopped and picked up a couple dozen wings for a party at a friends that lives nearby.  The wings were very good, nice size, very crispy and both the mild and hot were good.  The hot were hot but not to hot."}
{"text":"Nobby's has opened up a second location. This use to be another pizza shop.  

The pizza is a thinner crisp crust with a sweet sauce, so it should be popular, since sweet sauce seems to be popular in the area.  Actually, to sweet for my tastes.

This is a take out only location."}
{"text":"I ordered garlic bread and garlic parmesan wings. The garlic bread was okay, it could have used more garlic and was slightly dry. The wings were absolutely bathed in oil and they tasted slightly stale. They also gave us ranch instead of blue cheese dressing, which isn't a big deal but notable. I'd give this restaurant an average rating. To its credit, it is very inexpensive."}
{"text":"Ordered medium cheese pizza for pick up, and was told 20 minutes. We only live a 5 minute walk from Nobby's (one way), so I was surprised pizza was barely warm (though tssty, as usual). I called; they apologized, and offered to send another pizza. I asked for Buffalo wings, (which were decent, and hot). No problem!  Be ready in 10 minutes. Sorry for my trouble. Okay.

Picked up wings, and the guy again apologized sincerely, explaining that if they get busy with more/big orders, sometimes this might happen. Maybe I'm wrong, but why should orders after mine make mine late, cool, etc.?  The one or two other times there was a problem, these people were super nice, and gave me whatever I asked for, sincerely apologetic. So, I guess  I'm good, but still a bit puzzled..."}
