{"text":"Not sure if I had come here at a bad time,  but came here back in february with my family almost around closing and didnt notice at first, but as we sat there longer, we noticed that there was a bit too many little fruit flies flying around us for comfort as we ate. Dont remember what the food tasted like because i was too concentrated on swatting away flies from my face."}
{"text":"I had been here pretty much since they opened. The grill oyster with golden sauce is always my choice. I haven't been here as much this last couple of years but I still order their oyster every time I am here. 

The disappointment is that the oyster is no longer as yummy because the golden sauce is not the same anymore :(

On average, all other food are still good, priced reasonable as well."}
{"text":"OMG!!!! This place is so farrrrr off from good sushi it is not funny. I was so disappointed bc after reading the other reviews I was expecting decent sushi. Two things: they should list rice as an ingredient in their rolls bc all the rolls were bloated with rice mostly so you couldn't taste the food...just rice. Secondly, they started clearing the plates away while we were still eating. I couldn't believe it. Should you decide to go be prepared for mediocre sushi at best."}
{"text":"Great sushi, always friendly staff, great value. We've been eating here regularly since it opened 8 years ago and continue to bring friends and family every chance we get. Daniel, the owner, and his staff make this a terrific venue."}
{"text":"Me and my bf had high hopes coming here due to other reviews but it came out short. Maybe it was what we ordered? I got the katsu don and my bf got the 18 piece sashimi and sushi combo. Food was very mediocre and my katsu don was very unappealing.It was really fishy for a pork dish and the katsu was so dry. It was a mistake to order that. when I ordered it, the server looked surprised that I even wanted to order the katsu don. Lol. My bf said it was nothing special for his sashimi and sushi set. Service was good and  food came quick.  Got a tummy ache after. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner tonight and went for a spicy salmon maki roll and a chicken teriyaki bento box. The miso soup tasted like hot water and the spicy salmon was anything but spicy. The rest of the food was ok, nothing to really complain about. I also felt slightly uncomfortable as staff were a bit standoffish. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Best sushi place in Woodbridge. The food is always fresh and tastes much better than any all you eat restaurant. For this reason it is more expensive but it is definitely worth it. The staff is friendly and the decor makes it look like an authentic Japanese restaurant. This is the only place I will eat sushi."}
{"text":"Good place to come for Sushi and to hang out with friends for a couple hours. Always fresh"}
{"text":"I love this place!

This is woodbridge's finest sushi place! Their Koganie roll is out of this world. It realy deserves the 5 stars. Their pricing is great and on a friday or saturday it's ram jammed.

I sometimes end up here twice a week.  The staff is friendly and they speak english.

A must try if you like fresh sushi and if you have been to Japan and can compare.

I have and it really is authentic.

If I could give 6 stars I would."}
{"text":"I love this place! The only issue with the this restaurant is that it's in Vaughan / Woodbridge. I found this restaurant a long time ago, when I used to work in the area, and must have eaten at Koganei at least a few times a week. The sushi is always fresh and the proportions are very good. My favorite dishes are Koganei roll, sushi pizza, and the grilled black cod. There is always a lot of parking and the staff is friendly and fast. Daniel the owner is a great guy, and every time I'm in the area I always stop in to eat here."}
{"text":"A little pricy compared to other sushi places. Lunch menu is however good and more affordable. Friendly service, fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"The food is sub par, for some bizarre reason they layer their sashimi in lemons, sushi pizza is burnt and inedible, most rolls have an overwhelming amount of rice, or are 2-3 bite pieces they are so large.

They offer a delivery service that takes forever.  We've done both delivery and dine in.

They claim \"to do customer service better than anyone else\" but they define customer service as arguing with you because they are right and the customer is wrong, there is no possible way they made and error \"the chef said so\"

Wouldn't recommend!"}
{"text":"Service is always really good. It's a very clean restaurant and servers and chefs are very friendly and make sure to thank you on your way out. 

However, quality is really up and down. Sometimes the food is almost mediocre... But sometimes good... It's really strange! 

We still come here every now and then regardless because of convenience and proximity (and maybe loyalty because we've come here for so many years). 

They've updated their menu recently with lots of uni-focused dishes (yay for me!) and they import uni from Korea even when it's out of season at almost every other restaurant (which source from the US I believe). 

Still supporting Koganei and rooting for them!"}
{"text":"Danny is the best, he always serves me and I have never been disappointed! The lobster,  fatty tuna, and uni is unbelievable. If you want good Sake Danny has you covered. It's a $45 bottle and worth every penny. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I was craving for a bento box and didn't want to venture downtown for one so I decided to stop by here one night after shopping nearby. Service was pretty slow, considering there were only about 2 other tables seated that night. I ordered the chicken teriyaki bento box and an order of black dragon roll. The miso soup was pretty basic. The chicken teriyaki was drizzled with a thin layer of teriyaki sauce but tasted very flavorful. The vegetable tempura was not crispy at all and the california roll from the bento box came apart as I picked it up. Overall I was content with the sushi. I will probably only return for the lunch specials."}
{"text":"Great food. Not as filling as we thought, but we may have been really hungry..? The service could have been better though, it was kind of slow when we needed our waiter..."}
{"text":"I have been to this place a few times in last 10 years and each time I go, it has been impressing me less and less.

The last visit, we all have decided it would be the final visit.

3 of us ordered about $150 worth of food, no alcohol , only one soft drink. 
-Pork Cutlet  was way over cooked and dry. Probably was frozen too.
-Beef Teriyaki was also dry.
-All Tempura pieces were flavourless

But sushi rolls were fairly fresh, so I was debating if this place deserve 2 stars or 3 stars.
But when the waiter brought the last roll of sushi, it was confirmed that even 2 stars would be  pretty generous.  

He brought the plate and placed on the table and left.
As soon as I grabbed the corner of the plate to adjust its angle so everyone can reach, I felt the burning sensation on my finger.
The plate was scorching HOT!!! I have burned my finger tip.
I read the description on the menu again, and it said \"lightly Seared\". (Woodbridge Roll)
It wasn't \"Lightly\" Seared. It felt like the entire dish was freshly baked in oven. 

This place doesn't taste any better than other Chinese owned All- You -Can - Eat sushi places in the area, maybe the ingredients are slightly better quality, and they offer fancier dishes. 
But definitely not worth the price they charge.

For a-la-carte sushi, driver a little further and pick any place in North York off Yonge."}
{"text":"Koganei is the best sushi restaurant in the Vaughan/Woodbridge area by far. Granted, you do get what you pay for as it can get pretty pricey. For 2 people the bill can easily be $80+, depending on your taste for the expensive stuff. 

The menu is HUGE and can range from cheaper things such as your basic maki rolls and bento boxes to the more exotic geoduck (yum!) that comes as sashimi on this awesome ice tray and then in a small hot soup (double yum!). Basically you can't really go wrong with anything on the menu. And it's so big there's really something for everyone. 

Where do I even start? The sashimi is always very fresh and flavourful. The beef sashimi has better value than the beef tataki - both are the same price but you get more beef with the sashimi. The grilled oyster with golden sauce is really good as well. It's very similar to Guu's oysters but without the potatoes and mushrooms. Something different I had was the mackerel roll. It's grilled mackerel that's been rolled into a maki. If you like mackerel then I'd recommend it. 

The main reason why I really like it here is because they have uni in so many different dishes from your standard chirashi style dish (uni, spicy salmon, ikura all on top of rice for $23), uni shot ($10), uni fried rice ($23), and uni in various \"special rolls\" that will cost you a pretty penny but worth it if you're willing to splurge. The last time I was there I tried the King Roll (Shrimp Tempura, Avocado, Tobiko,  Spicy Mayonnaise, Top w/Sea Urchin, Salmon Roe, Scallion for $20). Even though it was so expensive, I was delighted to see there was a generous heap of uni on top of each piece so I enjoyed it tremendously. 

Lots of parking is right outside in the lot. Service is attentive and very good. They have a loyalty program called Lyonnes. If you go regularly I would recommend you get it so you can reap the rewards from emptying your wallet here. I've yet to redeem anything yet but I'll update this review once I do."}
{"text":"This place is really good. Great selections of rolls and the chefs are accommodating your request."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times.  It hasn't changed much over the years.  When in the area with friends or my hubby, we often come here.
They have a nice assortment of rolls, and sashimi/sushi.  I like the layout, although it's difficult to get to the restaurant, you really need to enter from the west side, going eastbound.  I have only ever been here for dinner, so I haven't had a chance to try the lunch specials.  Overall, it's a nice experience."}
{"text":"Best sushi restaurant in Vaughn. I recommend everything lol always fresh and amazing service"}
{"text":"Good but not great. Not very busy during lunch hours. Sushi was fresh and tasted good. 
I think this place is a little bit on the expensive side, and I believe that 30 bucks for rolls and 3 pieces of sashimi is a bit too much."}
{"text":"A perennial company Christmas party destination. Prices seem a mite higher but they seem to know what they're doing. Lots of selection you might not find at your little store front AYCE sushi joint along Bloor. You can get Sapporo and Asahi in can or bottle. They also carry Asahi dark. East Asia is sort of, after 30 years, moving away from pale lagers and joining the rest of the beer drinking world.

Deadly good salmon sashi. Lots of different roll choices but I've never been a fan of the rolls (beyond the makki). Hand rolls I've never been a fan of either but I really liked the ones we ordered.

What Nami is (or was) to downtown Toronto, Koganei is to Vaughan. Upscale as Vaughan allows. Some place you can bring a date or client and not feel like you're eating sushi in a cafeteria."}
{"text":"Over the years I have been here quite a few times and this is my favourite sushi restaurant to go to. The quality of the food has always been excellent. The restaurant is quite a good size but during lunch hours sometimes it is really busy due to all the businesses in the area."}
{"text":"Came here on mother's day w the parents. Wasn't overly impressed but then again the things we ordered were more for the parents than ourselves. Mom ordered udon soup - soup broth bland.. Nothing special. Koganei roll and Koganei fried rice were very tasty. Def recommend getting those two for sure. We also ordered one of those sushi/shashimi platters..decent. Would have to come back and try the other rolls before making a final judgement call on koganei. 0"}
{"text":"The sushi was pretty good; though the red dragon roll didn't look like the picture. The prices also seems to have gone up since the last time we went there. We usually get the special-but that was ~$20 and the dragon roll was $18. Nice decor; but a bit expensive now"}
{"text":"Came here as I wanted to try something different from my regular fare!  Man was I disappointed!  Ordered the Koganei Special roll with the Spicy Tuna + mixed tempura.  The Tuna roll had no spice or flavour whatsoever and the Koganei special roll had no taste to it either!  Also I found the Tempura to be as bland as the food I eat in Cuba(when on vacation!!).  All in all it was a really disappointing experience as the rolls looked amazing!  Nothing worse than bland sushi!  As I walked out I saw all the famous local Vaughan people who have eaten here!  Good for them cause I won't be back!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to try the King Roll but they \"did not have Uni\". We settled for the lobster sashimi, PC Roll, Tuna Tataki, and Spicy Salmon Roll. 

Lobster sashimi came in a huge fancy bowl with more lobster sashimi than I've ever had in my life. After having fresh lobster sashimi from many seafood places in downtown Toronto, I definitely did not enjoy it much here as it just did not taste fresh, and the texture was a bit off. Lobster soup also came with it. PC Roll was mediocre, definitely had better Tuna Tataki, and the Spicy Salmon Roll was beyond average. Service here was great, my tea cup was never empty! But for the price we spent here, I'd rather dine at a $$$ or $$$$ rated Sushi place in downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"Very good sushi, usually come here every six to eight weeks.  Nice to get away from the AYCE places that litter Woodbridge.  Love the spicy salmon rolls and crab pizza.  Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This used to be one of our favourite Japanese restaurants- they do have a great variety and the food is typically good. Past few times they've been very inconsistent with how they prepare the food, as well as have gotten smaller portion sizes.  The prices are pretty high- so it is disappointing to get even smaller portions than mostly any other Japanese a la carte.  As well they completely messed up a couple of delivery orders and didn't care at all to even so much as apologize when I brought it up to them. 
Today I ordered take-out and after leaving I opened the bag to find a half portion of my usual tobiko salad and two orders of the WRONG food!! When I brought it back, again not even an apology. Sorry Koganei, but this is it for me!!  Overpriced, small portions and terrible customer service!"}
{"text":"It was okay, but far from the best I've had...
Their namesake roll was okay, but a little too ricey.  Amount of sashimi for the price was good...  Their \"spicy\" [insert fish here] wasn't that spicy, although tasted okay and was neat with the added crunch.  Service was fine.  Overall price actually was good.
The neat thing was their sake heater, they had an 18 L box of Takara sake (drive by the factory every time I go into Berkeley) connected to it...  I need to stop by the Takara next time and see if I can also get an 18 L box of sake..."}
{"text":"This place is pretty hard to access if it's your first time coming.  This is mainly due to the construction on hwy 7.  If you are coming from the east end, you will need to turn into one of the smaller streets to enter the plaza.  Just look at the map before you go.

The restaurant itself is pretty nice.  I find that the place is very comfortable.  The workers are very professional and polite.  The service is on par with some of the western restaurants such as the keg.  

Food wise, it is overall pretty good. They have several specialties that you won't be able to find in other sushi place.  However, it is still not the best that I have had in terms of freshness.  Don't get me wrong, this place is perfectly fine.  

Price wise it's pretty expensive.  You do get what you pay for though.  I usually end up with a $100 bill when I go with my wife.

They also offer some cash back system when you sign up a card with them.  Not so sure about the details though.  

I do highly recommend you trying this place out if you haven't done so."}
{"text":"Was in the area and decided to have dinner here. I was optimistic because they offer gluten free soy sauce but was really disappointed with the food. The restaurant was clean but it would be your typical Japanese restaurant decor.

My husband got a sushi set and being gluten free, asked to have the fake crab either substituted or one the side so I could have it. When the dish came out, the server said they just didn't put it in. Um, ok.. but did we ask for it on the side? Or they couldn't be bothered to even put the sushi together and place on a separate dish? Hubby compared the quality to sushi from T&T. Not the best but OK in a pinch.

I ordered the grilled cod set combo that comes with soup, salad, rice and veggies. The soup and salad were fine but when the main came, I was shocked to see that the \"veggies\" are actually a heap of bean sprouts with only 3 pieces of broccoli. Being Asian, I expected bean sprouts but not at this level! I will say that the cod was great but kind of on the small side. Bean sprouts are a filler and not a main dish, and would you even consider them a vegetable? I mentioned this and she said the 3 pcs of broccoli was for decoration.

1 star for GF soy sauce 
1 star for a good cod"}
{"text":"2.5 star 

Sushi and Lunch Specials always been magnets for me.. my weakness!! I would walk in to most of the Japanese restaurants without giving it a second thought.. Of course the good reviews of Koganei on Yelp is another reason I am here for lunch! 

Sushi Lunch Specials ($11.95) 
- cabbage with mayo salad was a little disappointing, miso soup was lukewarm.. hmmm 
- nigri selection was really disappointing as well, I don't expect uni or toro..but tamago? fake crab? 
- The spicy salmon roll was pretty good...the 3 piece of California rolls was meh.. 

Nice decoration. Just love those red lanterns lining up the whole restaurant. The big windows let a lot of the natural sunlight filtering through. Soft Japanese songs accompanying my meal. While I am daydreaming about another trip to Japan, I was awakening and brought back to reality by the waitresses and sushi chefs discussing their personal life loudly in Cantonese.. thanks so much for sharing!"}
{"text":"I have been been coming here for more than 5 years because my dad refuses to go elsewhere. The fish is very fresh and the service is great. I believe they've recently changed management because the food setup has changed (for the better) and their prices have gotten even more ridiculous. For two, it's not hard to get to $70. Although their sashimi is excellent their rolls just don't compare. If you're looking for high quality fish this is the place, but not if you enjoy several flavourful rolls."}
{"text":"So a random neon sign advertising SUSHI draws us into this place for an adventure. My son and I like exploring new places to eat. We came in after the lunch rush so the place was rather quiet. The first clue that this was a different place was the bound book that arrived as their menu. We opted for some sashimi rolls and eagerly awaited for the food to come. Shortly our waiter arrived with the drinks and the little bottle of soy sauce. As usual I pour the soy into our little square bowls. It looks somewhat lighter than what we are used to. I dip my chopstick into the soy and am delightfully surprised. The taste is light and fresh with not the usual overbearing salty tones. I have to get more information on this. I flag down the waiter and ask him what brand of soy sauce this is. The waiter replies that they make their own! These guys brew their own soy sauce! It is this kind of detail that would make us come back here again even though it is a 40 minute drive away from our home. The food came and was as exceptional as we were expecting. The cost for the the meal was pretty much on par with any other sushi restaurant but the calibre of the experience was head and shoulders above the rest. If you like sushi and Japanese cooking in general I would definitely suggest you try this place out. This our go to comfort food."}
