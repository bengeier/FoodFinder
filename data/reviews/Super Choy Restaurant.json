{"text":"For RH King Academy students this place is the bomb. If your looking for something cheap and Chinese this is the place to go. The food is very Chinese and delicious. The price is also very Chinese like because it is cheap. I recommend this place to any one especially Chinese people. I go for Combo #3 which has 3 chicken wings and comes with fried rice its very filling especially for Chinese people.

{"text":"I love this place. My favourite dishes are the curry beef on rice (ask for it extra spicy and with extra sauce) and curry chicken wings which come with stir fried veggies. The quality is great and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"South Scarborough Residents are very fortunate to have Super Choy in their neighbourhood! I love this place! We have been going to Super Choy for about 6 years now, and we go at least twice a month, sometimes more for take-out. 

They have a few different take-out menus. There is a board in the restaurant that lists common dishes at extremely low prices. These are our favourites: lemon chicken, chicken chow mien, beef with noodles, chicken balls with rice. All of these dishes are fresh, delicious and extremely reasonably priced. 

Won Ton Soup is made with pork wontons and is excellent. One of the best I have had in the city. You must try it if you go to Super Choy.

Egg rolls are not so great, they are basically stuffed with vegetables and been sprouts, but we order them anyway because they are dirt cheap. 2 of us get Won Ton Soup, 2 Eggrolls, 3 entrees and it comes to about $18. It is made fresh right in front of you, is healthy and has NO MSG! When they get to know you they are very friendly and will give you cool chinese calendars at Chinese New Year! 

Ordering deliver from Super Choy is a lot more expensive than going in and ordering off the board. We have done that one once or twice and the cost difference was significant. It's easier and cheaper to just go in and order straight off the boards, you save a tonne of money and they are pretty fast."}
{"text":"Used to come here in high school. It's good for the price but again, since it's near a high school there's a lot of nuisance to deal with if you go during the lunch hour."}
{"text":"Sucks BIG time!!!!

Ordered # 1 & #5. 

One might initially think it is cheap ($4.50-$5.75) but if the food sucks, it becomes expensive!

The place smells like a chimney; the cook is a chain-smoker!

You are better of buying KFC's $5 fill-ups... it is edible and comes with a drink.

Don't even think about it."}
{"text":"I really do enjoy the food, but the service is not great, the staff is not friendly they charge EXTRA for a pack of soya sauce and then you have to hear them complain about \"food is not cheap and that everything is going up in price\"
And Not only that.....
They also charge to use the debit mashine no matter what is the total.  
But but....  The food it really good...."}
{"text":"What a delight to finally find this take-out place!  I noticed other reviews after having passed this place one day.  We decided to try it and we LOVED it.  Definitely the lemon chicken that the students at the school nearby rave about is a return menu item.  We will be back to try more!"}
