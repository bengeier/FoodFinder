{"text":"Can never go wrong with The Keg if your a steak lover. The location has very friendly staff  a great atmosphere. A very central Durham location with plenty around it. They're seafood is very tasty too."}
{"text":"Lately I haven't been to pleased with the food.. I don't get it !! It's a cookie cutter of a high priced steak place & yet depending on who the 1st cook is, your taking a chance that it will be right. Overpriced for what you get.."}
{"text":"Five of us went there for a family dinner. The service was good but the pork ribs and steaks served with potatoes and vegetables were cold. The taste was on the artificial side for the pork ribs; as for the steaks, they just can't beat the steaks we grill in our own back yard. The service was good and the ambience was nice but on the noisy side."}
{"text":"Eaten here twice now and it has not disappointed.    Great steaks, chicken and desserts.   Top notch service.    Reco to hit this place early or post 9pm especially if you are visiting thurs-Sunday."}
{"text":"Tipicaly go here every Friday cannot say enough about the staff as we sometimes show up between 11 pm and midnight. Even at this time our food it perfect. Excellent job by staff hats off to the chef's please keep up the great work."}
{"text":"Ok so I have been to a few Kegs and really the Keg is not a choice somewhere I would think about going. My last straw was going and ordering lobster feast to find out after everyone was serve there was no lobster. It was to be my last visit. The manager was great and gave us a $100 gift card to come back. I swore never.  Well my husband talked me into it as we did have the gift card. We went back and no only was the service over the top, the food was excellent. Only when we finish our meal did we let the manager know we had the gift card and the experience was outstanding. I thought is was a one off as one out of 10 great experiences is not a record, but I agreed again to go and everything was really good again. I have been back at least 5 times and the Keg in Ajax has proven great bar service as well as table service, the food has been great and I love the Billy Miner Pie. It's a winner!"}
{"text":"Excellent service! The keg food is generally the same but the service changes location to location! Ajax again won the customer service award.  The waiter listened to my 15 year old and made him feel special while entertaining my parents on their 51st anniversary!  Good job!  Waiter-Luke"}
{"text":"The food here is the same menu and quality as other kegs. I usually order the baseball steak with veg and my husband orders the chicken with veg and mash. The food quality is on par with every other Keg - which is excellent. The chicken dish is a bit sweet for my liking and usually that sweet sauce covers the veg too, but my husband seems to like it.   I really like some of their apps, including the shrimp cocktail and the brie plate.   Some of the servers are extremely nice, you can tell they really love their jobs! Other servers are phoning it in and it's obvious.   The downfall: It gets really busy here on weekends. Like, clausterphobic busy. I have a small baby, so I started avoiding this place on the weekends because it's just too hard. You can't go in with your stroller because the queue area is too packed. I went in with my baby sleeping in the carseat and my husband and I had to stand around it and aggressively push people away to prevent anyone from stepping on our child in the carseat. It's too packed and too dark. And to be honest, hungry people are rude af."}
{"text":"Always has good food and good service.  This Keg makes the best old fashioned and the Oscar is amazing."}
{"text":"The service here is exceptional. The steak if you are not happy with it they will make sure it's perfected. NY striploin is the best for overall taste. Clean restaurant and great service all around."}
{"text":"Let's start with the bad...one time I came here with a few friends for a special occasion and after not being able to finish my amazing food, I asked for the food to be packaged up to go, so looking forward to my leftovers...the waitress handed me a bag with my food in it, and when I get home, the bag she placed in my hand turned out to have someone elses leftovers in them...so disappointing!  Other than that, the food is a perfect 10/10 every single time, the staff is always friendly and welcoming and I always want to come back.  My family asked me where I wanted to go for my birthday this year and of course I wanted to come here...I love that they really show their customer appreciation for special occasions by always bringing a free birthday dessert...this is the only place I've seen that doesn't give a sliver of cake or a bite sized dessert for free for birthdays...you get a full sized, amazing dessert; I'm not all that into desserts but it really says something about customer value to the company :)"}
{"text":"So amazing. The baseball top sirloin is just amazing. Make it a classic and get the delicious Caesar salad or get escargot to start. Both very amazing!"}
{"text":"Very nice decor and patio. The food is good although the last few times I've been my steak was overcooked.  Love the bread. Good servers. Very busy Fridays and Saturdays ."}
{"text":"- it's a keg. - if you've been one before, you know what you're getting into. this one is no different. - if you havent, it's all dark wood and low lighting while eating a delicious steak - TIP: always get the KEG size drinks (whether wine or a caesar!)"}
{"text":"I came here for a birthday celebration with my family. I was extremely impressed with the ambiance! As well, we received fantastic service from everyone we interacted with. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Just returned from the Keg.  Or as I would like to call.. \"Ole Reliable\". I've done steak in Edmonton that was rated and some of the best.. Been to some great steakhouses in Texas.... but this is still the most reliable meal I've ever had.    Consistantly well prepared steak and portions every single time.  The steak seasoned and cook exact to my order.  Veggies were cooked yet crisp.  Drinks were made perfectly, not overpowering with alcohol.  Service from Patrick was up to par as we usually have Luke.  The key here is the location, even among Keg locations in Toronto, this is still my favourite and would go so far today the best of all of their locations in the GTA.  Trendy, busy even on a Sunday, doesn't feel enclosed or \"rustic\" like some other locations. 2 thumbs up here..."}
{"text":"Ever notice all the wait staff are under weight? Also I can not stand when a waitress talks to us in a tone that I feel I should be back in kindergarten!  We were just asked, how are your salads treating you? Lol ummmmmmm how do you answer that"}
{"text":"I have been here many times but this was the first time we have had a bad experience.  We came in after 9pm on a Saturday night and sat in the bar. After not being approached by any wait staff we went back to the host and asked for a seat in the dining room. The evening did not improve as the wait for service was lengthy the entire evening, despite only a few tables in the room. The food was good but served almost cold. The waiter acknowledged the delay but still visited our table rarely. Things as a whole didn't seem to function as seamlessly as usual. We were really looking forward to our dinner and left feeling very disappointed, especially due to our previous positive experiences."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in the area.  It's a chain, but the food is always greAt!  Love the Keg Classic Filet dinner."}
{"text":"We've tried going to this restaurant 3 times now and can't get in. Twice were during the week and there is always a long wait. I would gladly sit in the lounge except it's FULL each time. The areas to sit while you wait are full. I told my boyfriend that me standing in heels and a dress to wait 30-40 minutes (we were told) wasn't happening. Sadly, each time we leave."}
{"text":"We have a daughter with severe peanut allergy and we were reluctant to bring her to The Keg.After we were seated,manager Denise gave us some food options for our daughter to choose from.She was very helpful and extremely knowledgeable on Keg ingredients.Our server was Davis who was very caring for our concerns.Food and service was outstanding.Thanks to the great staff at Ajax Keg."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere Great steaks Great service  Cannot complain at all  Have been there many a times with my wife  The filet is still my fav on the menu  If I want an appy.....I will usually grab the shrimp cocktail or bacon wrapped scallops  Don't frequent too much as it's pricey .....but you get what you pay for  Will keep seeing you tonight when I want to indulge"}
{"text":"Have never been disappointed with the Keg! Our server was great. Very knowledgeable, professional and friendly. The food is always great and the prices are reasonable for what you get. The prime rib is our favorite and the Creme Brulee is always perfect."}
{"text":"Love The Keg!  I've been to a number of locations and the one in Ajax is the best I've seen.  The bar is spectacular and so is the decor throughout the restaurant.  Big location, great atmosphere and service.  And of course the food as always is amazing.  I regularly get the French Onion Soup and the Prime Rib.  Sometimes I'll get the Mushrooms Neptune or Baked Garlic Shrimp.  I don't think I've ever had a bad experience at The Keg regardless of the location, but if you are in the Ajax area this Keg is definitely worth going to."}
{"text":"Food was great, I ordered a rare steak and it was cooked perfect while maintaining perfect moisture within. We also had beyond excellent service from our waitress. Probably one of the best experiences I've had out of all the other Kegs I've been to. :)"}
{"text":"I have to say... I'm surprised! This was, by far, the best experience I've ever had at a Keg.  We arrived shortly before 7:30 on a Thursday night and although we were advised  there was a 30 minute wait, we were seated almost immediately.  This evening I opted for their Pecan Sirloin ($23.95) which is an 8oz top sirloin that's topped with pecans and goat cheese. Now, I'm a big believer that everything should be made with goat cheese and this is the reason why. Of course, my steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare (The Keg rarely gets it wrong) but the combination of pecans and goat cheese sent this steak over the top. I would definitely order this dish again.  The service was also the best I've experience at any Keg in recent years. There was a rather large party beside us and our server moved amongst her tables as though she was hosting a dinner party, making sure everyone had what they needed at all times. It was really quite impressive to watch.  Over all, an excellent evening and compared to all other Keg's, this one is... as good as it gets!"}
{"text":"Oh my....this is like the BEST Keg in Toronto I have been too. It is absilutely gorgeous!!Im not kidding, dont erase me filter!! This place oh there is,a waterfall outside which you can enjoy until the summer but this place is so nice. I was so impressed with the service very busy make sure you make reservations. I love the setup of the place especially those nice soft buns they give you before your meal. Yummy I can just eat those. this is definitely going in my favorite place list! The ribs...the creme brulie...thats all I have to say...I should go on a diet, rather than visiting these delicious places..lol"}
{"text":"This is our \"go to\" place for birthdays, anniversaries, etc.  It's close by, not too crowded if you get there early, and the food is always good, sometimes great. My wife particularly loves their bread. They have an excellent wine list for a chain restaurant.  The wait staff is friendly and knowledgeable.  Certainly our favourite restaurant in the Pickering/Ajax area."}
{"text":"In spite of it being what must be their craziest night (Valentines Day on Family Day weekend) we had a wonderful meal. Found seats and ordered drinks in the bar (mine: Pomegranate Fizz and his: Manhattan) with some appetizers. The calamari appeared quickly but the scallops were delayed. The calamari were crispy and the 2 dips delicious. One was mayo/lemony and one was more Asian zing.     We had a shorter wait than expected, so just as we started our appetizer we saw our widget light up and a hostess helped us transfer to our table. A waiter introduced himself and left to chase down our scallops. Minutes later another waiter came to tell us he'd be taking over. He was good, but I don't think I've ever been hammered for drink orders as much as I was this night. Became a bit annoying. My hubby ordered a beer to come with the steak (which, after the steak was delivered he had to remind them of when they asked us again if we wanted drinks - and then they didn't even have the beer). This is the only reason they lost a star.   In the confusion they found the scallops which were cooked perfectly. The seafood sauce served with them is WAY too overpowering. Needs a brown sugar or teriyaki sauce.   I love the bacon-wrapped filet and it is always tender and cooked to perfection as it was on this very busy night. We split the 10 oz as we'd already had those appetizers. The side of mushrooms were less flavourful than those I've had in the past at The Keg. Garlic mashed potatoes are the best side and we loved them.   Finished by splitting a Billy Miner ice cream pie slice drizzled with chocolate and caramel."}
{"text":"They must be doing something right. I came with a group of seven on a Saturday evening and we waited a little over an hour for a table. They do not take reservations for this time.  By the time we sat down, we were starving. We were never so happy to see freshly baked sourdough bread with whipped butter. Mmm, it tasted good! Maybe because we were starving?  We all ordered some kind of steak. Forget the appetizers. No foreplay required. Bring on the meat! Of course, we also ordered some red wine.  My 20oz Ribeye with garlic mashed potatoes was cooked perfectly medium-rare! It was tender and juicy. The veggies were cooked perfectly. Other than the bone, it looked like I licked the plate clean. I guess it's been a while since I've had steak.  My companions ordered smaller steaks, prime rib, and even lobster. Some of them ordered their meat medium-well. Seriously?!? I guess they enjoyed it that way.  For dessert, we split a couple of Billy Miner pies. Mmm, so good. So sweet. So fattening.  Our server was good, very attentive and helpful.  It wasn't a cheap night but it was a good night!"}
{"text":"My teenagers & I love the Keg.  It's our special place to go & we're never disappointed!"}
{"text":"We went to Keg on a weekend evening with my wife and friends. I selected the Chef's Special.... Top Sirloin (medium rare) with prawns... it was tender, juicy, full of flavor... perfect!!"}
{"text":"The Keg at this location is very good. Waiters are pros and the beef is cooked the way you like it.  We requested a quiet booth away from the crowds.  A great place for any occasion."}
{"text":"Prices went up anywhere from 2-4$ which is annoying but this place is a classic! Amazing service! Great food & wine. Sometimes the vegetables could be cooked more and the add on sauces taste a bit watered down but the rib steak with blue cheese crust is by far the best thing on the menu"}
{"text":"Perfect date night spot in Ajax. Really classy on the inside. The complimentary bread was very warm, crusty on the outside and soft on the inside. I had the 10oz prime rib with a choice of a side of fries. The cut was perfectly medium rare. It was tender and seasoned so perfectly on the outside. I'm going to be dreaming about that piece of meat for a while."}
{"text":"Its the keg...however with that said I found the service to be above average and the decor very nice.  My only complaint is the wait for a table and lack of taking reservations, but it's hard to blame them for being successful"}
{"text":"Been going to this location for close to ten years.  Always had great service and great food.  I finally branched out from the prime rib last night and had the filet mignon.  Cooked perfectly!  Server was friendly.  Yes, sometimes wait times are outrageous but that isn't their fault, they are just that good!  Keep up the great work Keg Ajax!"}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate multiple family birthdays on a Sunday night. However, service was incredibly slow and they got one of the dishes wrong at our table, but we didn't figure that out until it was too late. I got the manhattan cut of steak and it was disappointing. I didn't want a huge steak but this particular steak was nothing to write home about. Disappointingly slow service, even though we were a good sized party, there was no reason for it. Service has consistently gone downhill since last year."}
{"text":"Finally get to try this restaurant as I had some gift cards that I need to use. It was a busy night on a Friday night as I guess it should be. I had the New York strip and it was amazing how the meat was tender and melts right in your mouth. Would have taken pictures but had to finish the food. Will come here again."}
{"text":"Always the best service at the ajax location. Never had a problem and the billy miner pie is the best"}
{"text":"Ordered a couple of great entrees - Thai chicken and another chicken dish with brocollini and mashed potatoes and au jus.  Great flavour and very juicy.  One tip - because Ajax is like the armpit of suburbia, the keg is one of only a few good places like this to chow down so weekends get mega busy.  Show up at 5 or 6 or else expect to wait for an hour."}
{"text":"Came here for a Friday night celebration with my girlfriend. They don't take reservations on Fridays or weekends, but we were seated without a wait. Our waiter was courteous and friendly. My girlfriend ordered a rare NY Strip and I ordered a rare Prime Rib. Both meats were cooked very nicely. Portions were perfect. A complimentary slice of cake was brought to us, on the house to celebrate our anniversary. Great customer service, good food, great environment. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! Wait time on the weekend are insane but the food is worth it. Service is really good and man they have beautiful girls working here.  The Oscar is my favorite dish with crab on the side. Expensive but worth it!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend tried to seduce me tonight by taking me to eat here. This is in my top 3 steakhouses. Atmosphere is great, we had a seat by the fireplace. She got the steak covered with shrimp and scallops. I tried it and it was excellent the sauce they used reminded me of a shrimp scampi, it worked well with the steak. I got the top sirloin and lobster. The steak was cooked to perfection and had beautiful flavor, the lobster was succulent and tender."}
{"text":"I can't believe there hasn't been a review for this location yet.   The Keg is one of my all time favourite Steakhouse's and the Ajax location is at the top of my list.  There is no need for me to even open the menu, New York Classic medium rare, baked potato and a bottle of red.   This location is always busy,  you will  wait for a table more often than not.  The good news is they have a spacious bar with a great atmosphere and friendly staff behind the bar waiting to hand you your beverage of choice while wait.  A special bonus if they are really busy, they usually hand out some free appetizers to hold you over.  If you are looking to share a bottle of wine with a loved one on a cozy patio, the Keg has just that.      PS if you need to get out of the doghouse the Billy Miner Pie (chocolate crust with mocha ice cream topped with caramel and hot fudge) always does the trick.  :-)"}
