{"text":"This place is awesome, so awesome, its why I chose the apartments I did, because it's next to this bar......and work.  Its a great dive bar, and everyone gets along.  Regardless of race, gender, social class, everyone is there to have drinks and have fun.  Fridays are real busy, on the off days its quiet, so choose what you want, but a great place.  You can't find bars like this in Mesa or Chandler, which is why Phoenix is the place I choose now."}
{"text":"Yep its a bar but you would not know it when you taste the food! Order the turkey bacon club (with bbq sauce on the side) when it's the special. Its amazing and I want it on the menu!!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  It is comfortable, fun, and the food and drink rock!!!!  The owners are awesome and have made the place great.  For an easy going night with some great cocktails or drafts ---  check it out.  Be prepared to have a great time."}
{"text":"I dream about The Heater burger loaded with jalapenos and the tater tots! The D10 is a great place to grab some dinner and one of my favorite local beers, an Orange Blossom."}
{"text":"This was a Yelp directed stop after a long day of traveling and finally arriving in the Phoenix area.   The restaurant/bar is in a very odd location in fact we were not even sure it was open or the right place when we pulled up.  First impression was dive bar and we might have made a mistake when we walked in. However everything was awesome from there. Great selection of local Beers on tap and in the bottle with friendly service was a great start.  The burgers were amazing, clearly a hand formed beef patty which was HUGE and topped with texas toothpicks bacon and cheese.  Cooked to juicy deliciousness I never expected a burger of this quality coming from this place.   My quesadilla was the best one I have ever had, a huge triple decker hand put together with tender steak, onion, tomato and jalapeno in it.  The guys or gals in the kitchen clearly took some pride in the food they put out and it showed.  Everything tasted great and although the menu was simple it was classic Bar food done to a really high level.    Nothing fancy here, just great bar food with good drink prices in a no frills sports bar, just my kind of place. When we come back to Phoenix, we will be stopping here for sure.  THANK YOU YELP FOR HELPING ME FIND THIS PLACE!!! ( I never would have found it w/o you!)"}
{"text":"I like to go here because the crazy ASU kids don't go here. It reminds me if a bar out of a movie where all the people are just hard-working Americans looking to relax in a calm environment."}
{"text":"Smells like stale beer and not very friendly. If you are looking to kill time before a flight, try somewhere else."}
{"text":"This is an awesome bar. A great beer selection, lots of big screens to watch the games, and fun people. I am in love with Orange Blossom beer. Yummm! You've got to try it! They've got shuffleboard, darts, and pool tables so it makes for a good time!  I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Spring Training A's baseball.  Draw 10 became our go-to pre-post baseball drinky drink spot this Spring Training season.  The outside is very unassuming but the vibe inside is cool. Typical sports bar, pool tables in the back, patio area outside, large bar area, tvs everywhere including a large projection screen. The bartenders were really cool. Their beer menu is extensive. The drinks are strong (I had to ask for more chaser). The food is good too. I recc the green chili mac n cheese.  $5 liquor pitcher with a Yelp check in!!"}
{"text":"To:  Kelley C.     Jonesboro, GA  I disagree with your review, Nikki's service to you was exceptional. I know this because I've gone in there several times. and her service was top notch. and she even asked me to close and i had no issue with it.  it doen't reflect the business or her decision to close out. have you ever been in that field of business? if not then maybe you would understand."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place more stars. Nikki is the best bar tender I have ever had the pleasure to meet. She is amazing and astute and awesome."}
{"text":"I wanted to take time out of my day to write this review for my friends at D10. First let me say that there are some reviews on here that are not warranted. I am a gay-Hispanic male that's been coming here for years and I can say that the good people at D10 are far from being racist and a homophobe (especially Angie and Lisa). As for JB being accused of running the KKK, all I have to say is take a look around at the patrons and the men and women that run D10...point in case. Now as for the \"stumpy\" comment, you should be ashamed of yourself for being less than a human being. With that being said, let's get down to business.   The atmosphere here at D10 is what you'd expect from a neighborhood dive bar. There are a lot of regulars (me included) as well as some fresh faces, great music ranging from Motown to county to top 40's. As for the food, they have recently updated their menu for the better. With new favorites like the shaved rib eye with horseradish or a classic such as Mel's green chili Mac n cheese. While we're at it, let's throw in my favorite the honey hot chicken wings. The brew selection is great with craft beers and seasonal brews, as well as the good old domestics. Bottom line, D10 is a great place to hang out and kill time or pull up a couple of bar stools with friends for drinks, food, and laughter."}
{"text":"Not the old place. Remodeled and everything is fricken grey.  Trying for the industrial look, but not hitting any pow.  Service great, drinks good.  Tried a burger... ehhhh.  Was good, but not as good as the old draw 10.  Tasted more like denny's or applebee.  Will return, but definitely looks/food not hitting the mark.  Adequate, but don't have the urge to return like before."}
{"text":"This is my local townie bar. Judge free environment. I can show up in sweatpants and not feel out of place. Wouldn't come here to look for girls but a great place to have a drink and a bite to eat. The bar food is awesome. The tater tots are a must!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to this bar on Saturday for a late night drink after taking in a concert at the Marquis theatre. We had heard great things about Draw 10, so first time, decided to check it out. When I walked through the door, this obnoxious woman yelled in my face dollar \"drinks here, I work here, I'm the new bartender, so tell the bartender to give you the special!!!! Me and My husband who are both attorneys immediately felt uncomfortable with this woman because we are used to being treated more respectfully. #1 Don't have your \"bartender\" drunk in the bar on her day off!!!!! POOR Management!!!!! Anyways, we proceeded to get a round of cocktails of from the blond, pretty bartender who was on duty that evening; was a very courteous and professional and did a great job of getting our order quickly. Thank you for that! We stayed for one round, because we couldn't have a conversation- same obnoxious customer/employee went behind the bar and turned the music up. Another violation- #2 An employee off work is Not Allowed behind a bar while drinking as a patron. A SUGGESTION to the OWNER: Get a Better Manager or Manage your own establishment if you want it to remain in business. Your only and best employee is the blond female bartender who was making you money with class and professionalism. The other \"off the clock\" drunk, female bartender/barfly  should find a watering hole where she's not offensive to Draw 10's customer base. As a result, we left and word of mouth goes a long way......"}
{"text":"Me and a couple friends decided to check this place out after a baseball game and i must say we had a pretty good time ! definitely would go back!! and you have to try the tachos best things ever created like nachos but with tater tots instead of chips i am in love:)"}
{"text":"I go to this bar because it's close to where I work. I like this bar because they have a really good selection of beer, decent patio to hang out on and I love this bar for the wings! Thank you Mel."}
{"text":"We Just started going to draw 10 and have always had great service from blonde waitress I believe Jules. Thank you for making us feel welcome and we will be coming back."}
{"text":"Just moved to Phoenix and my boyfriend talked up this place so much ...he didn't do justice!  I love dive bars and chill people and this place couldn't be better but their food is great too!! The ladies at he bar are great and never leave your beer glass empty!! Look forward to coming here and just relaxing!!"}
{"text":"This place has it all...minus the attendance. There is plenty of seating, pool tables, and shuffle board. Such a fun place to just hang out. Prices are right and the staff is great. Get here abd have a great time."}
{"text":"What a great dive bar!  The bartenders pour a mean drink (just thinking about another shot from this place gives me shudders), the drink prices are incredible, and its just a really great, low-key place to drink with your friends.  It doesn't look like much from the outside, but step inside if you want that perfect something to tickle your dive bar fancy!"}
{"text":"ATTENTION HIPSTER DOUCHE BAGS: THIS PLACE IS NOT FOR YOU!! Yea that's right go to Mill ave or whatever place you go to that we've never heard of. This is my type of bar. I'm in my mid twenties and I hate Mill ave. I also dislike all the \"hip\" bars around town. My idea of a good time is hanging out at a chill place where there are cheap food and drinks and where the pretension is left at the door. I recently went to a Tempe bar where the service was abysmal. I had to interrupt the bartenders conversation TWO times. If I'm paying you money I don't want to have to wave my hands up and down for you to serve me. Especially when it's a slow night. I won't name names but suffice it to say that this bar is not the 'TOPS' at customer service. Back to Draw 10, I came in and used my Yelp check in which is a $5 pitcher of alcohol. $5! Normally they have this special on Tuesdays only but if you check in using your Yelp app you can have it any day of the week. So we got a pitcher of Vodka Tonic. Really good. We also came during happy hour. The best happy hour. Well drinks are $1.50! The happy hour food menu is great too. Another note here if you're a hipster foodie snob this place is also not for you. Typical bar food like $2 french fries and jalapeno tater tots. The biggest reason I will be back is the service. A lot of bars that are popular with the \"young\" crowd feel they have to have a young mentality towards customer service. For example acting bothered whenever putting in an order. Waiting around forever while they finish talking about where their stupid meaningless band is playing this week. Let me just say I went to Draw 10 on a Friday night and NEVER had to wait to put an order in. It was pretty busy and as soon as I walked up to the bar I was served. Incredible. The staff was very friendly as well. I do admit I live in downtown Tempe which makes riding to Draw 10 really easy. It's about  a 10-15 minute bike ride from Mill ave. I'm giving Draw 10 5 stars but I wish I could give it ten. It's nice to know there are still quality bars around that treat their customer's right."}
{"text":"AMAZING staff, food, and GREAT drink specials!  I'm happy I discovered Draw 10!  If you are looking for a really cozy neighborhood bar, this is the place!  You wouldn't know to look at the outside, but this really is a GREAT place to relax and wind down after a crazy day!  The bar staff is really great, the food and drink specials are great, and the"}
{"text":"Good food and nice place for lunch. Had the \"devils\" cheese steak and it was good!"}
{"text":"Great place to hang with friends eat some fantastic green chili pork and drink.   They have a great beer selection!"}
{"text":"Love draw 10! The food is awesome and what you'd expect from a neighborhood sports bar, drinks are great and prices are even better, staff is amazing and the crowd is usually right there with em, shuffleboard, pool, video games, t.v.'s everywhere, and a covered patio! What more could you ask for? I'm lucky to have a bar like this around the corner"}
{"text":"Let's get something straight people. This place is amazing. I am a regular here, it's worth the money. Also the bartenders are amazing, especially Angie. She know how to make drinks, very friendly and HOT!!!!!!!!! Overall great bar. Go and have fun, the my word I've been going there for a while now. Angie and the crew keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Draw 10 Bar has become my second home! It's not that I feel there extremely comfortable and homey. I do. But what I'm trying to say is that I spend too much time there, so I only need to bring my staff and settle down there for good. I have never felt uncomfortable eating my meal alone there! Being a young female is may be a bit weird to visit such places alone, but this place is completely different! I love their extensive menu, their delicious food and coldest beers ever in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Hadn't noticed this place until a friend that lives in the area recently suggested it.   Not too far from Tempe, and a solid place to just relax and talk over drinks and food. Now that I think about it, it's also a short walk from a light rail stop. Highly recommend if you're looking for a bar with low low prices and something that's good mix of fun and laid back."}
{"text":"We gathered at Draw 10 before the Oakland baseball game.  The bar was full of baseball fans and enthusiasm!  The bartender was attentive...magners pear cider on draft (we like that) and the food was good bar food.  Prices were right...a fun place to be!"}
{"text":"They have pretty good food at this place.  very close to home.  the tots are so good!  good place to have a drink also.  free pool.  lots of specials."}
{"text":"Great food, people and atmosphere! $2 Shot Specials daily! Angie is always positive and remembers you in your next visit!"}
{"text":"Draw 10 was the first place my girlfriend & I stopped in when we moved to Phoenix. The guy behind the bar (Chad) came around and sat us, welcomed us, and took our orders. The Mozz Stix and Pulled Pork Sliders were delicious. Chad came by to check on things, we talked a bit, and he brought us the check as we finished up. The place has the \"small town bar\" feel that I've always preferred, so with good food, beer, and good people, I'm glad I live within walking distance!"}
{"text":"Draw 10 is not just your neighborhood sports bar.  It is a home away from home.  After moving here from out of state, I was welcomed by an extremely friendly and personable staff who called me by my name. As a young lady in a big city, I feel comfortable having a meal here alone. The menu is extensive and new items are frequently introduced.  The cooks are talented chefs and take pride in customizing your dish.   I recommend Draw 10 to anyone looking for great food, the coldest beer in town and good times - in a hometown bar atmosphere."}
{"text":"Omg, I got a 30 oz Orange Blossom and it was $10.25!!!!  That's exorbitant!  The bartender was really rude as well.  I expect to pay that much in Scottsdale or the airport but not in the ghetto, lol.  I'll never be back."}
{"text":"I only found this place because of yelp.  It is a delightful bar with great service.  The daytime guy was super nice, got my drinks and food to me quickly.  When he found out i was in town on vacation, went the extra mile to get me the insert in the New Times about spring training.   We had a nice chat about Phoenix and how much it has changed in 20 years.  I might stop by there again before I leave town. I highly recomment it  and prices are very reasonable too."}
{"text":"Stopped in yesterday with my girlfriend to check out the remodel since they reopened!  New staff and ownership are good - ordered onion rings and cheese sticks - both of which were good. Had a few PBRs and a shot - prices were good.   I'd say this place has gotten better - and I already enjoyed Draw 10 before!"}
{"text":"This is a total dive bar has the decor of a dive bar, smell of a dive bar, waitress of a dive bar, and customers you would find at a dive bar. Staff was friendly and attentive, jukebox had some great songs for everyone and the food was really good they have a great selection of burgers with a ton of fixings. I came on a Sunday night so there wasn't many people there but from the looks of it, it seemed to be locals where everyone knew everyone, cool little place I will stop by next time I am in the area."}
{"text":"Local watering hole.  Very friendly.atmosphere.  Angie the bartender was very nice and helpful.  Regular good bar food... Exactly what you.would expect from this local joint"}
{"text":"Tried the grilled chicken sandwich, but I added green chilie and pepper jack cheese.  AWESOME!!! perfectly cooked and well seasoned.  The food was a little weak when they first opened but they've come a long way!"}
{"text":"I have been passing this place for years. I knew then as it is now a neighborhood bar with barely a neighborhood.  Upon entering I found it a little more casual than I expected. maybe it was lighting it could have been because it was nearly empty on a Saturday night.  We had a small gathering of friends that stopped for a beer after a birthday dinner, so we didn't eat here. The menu looks like what you would expect, its just bar food. probably great enough to cure the beer munchies.  What I liked best was the service, the bartender was engaging, welcoming and efficient. he had a kind hearted spirt most great bartenders have.   This is a regular spot for my buddies that live in the apartments next door. I am already looking forward to returning with them to catch the beer munchies."}
{"text":"Went here last night with a group of friends for an event we had planned. I didn't get to try any of the food this time, but the drinks were affordable and the wait staff was very nice. Our group was probably large for them, especially on a Monday night, and they handled us very well with good service. Oh yea, another thing I noticed was a REAL dart board! I was very excited to see this as it seems to be rare these days."}
{"text":"Nice divey little place, with a decent tap.  They have Modus Hoperandi, so I'm happy.  Staff is friendly, vibe is non pretentious. They have a pool tables, and they let you vape inside.  It's close to my office, so if I'm in need of an after work quaffing, I tend to hit it up."}
{"text":"We came here because we purchased a deal on restaurant.com. We showed up at about 10:05pm on a date we had our 12 month old with us and we asked the bartender if that was ok, she stated we would have to seat on the restaurant section which was absolutely fine with us. We noticed there was only one person working, the bar tender, her name is Nikki. Right away she brought us the menu and offered to get drinks for us. After she came back with our drinks she informed us the grill was closed which is the only reason why I didn't give 5 stars. We still decided to go for the fried stuff which is my favorite anyway WINGS! She did the cooking running back and forth with her costumers at the bar and us she really is amazing! Wings were also very delicious. Thanks!"}
{"text":"A must do in Phoenix! Pool, darts, a shuffleboard, FANTASTIC bar food, colorful locals, all sorts of alcohol. Very cheap, very dive (but they've remodeled so it's less dive now than it used to be), an outdoor smoking section, near the light rail (don't drink and drive, folks), lots of TVs, poker nights. This place has it all. Depending on when you go the crowd can vary drastically, but it's always a good time. I practically lived there when I was in Phoenix and couldn't have lived near a better bar. If you're not fully impressed the first time you go, give it another chance. I promise it will become one of your favorite places, too."}
{"text":"We were out walking in the area and decided it was time for dinner. There weren't a lot of options in the area so we found this place on yelp and gave it a try.   I'm glad we did!  We \"Checked-in\" here to get the drink special which was a good deal! But I was not expecting the food to be so good. The menu is regular bar food but they excecute it really well. I had a med-rare burger with cottage cheese as a side (by the way I'm happy they had more options than just fries :-)) they sprinkled it with a bit of paprika and it was a very nice touch. I would have taken a picture but it was gone before I found my camera.  The atmosphere was very much like a rough and tumble bar. A lot of the partons seemed to know the bartender pretty well. She was really nice and chatty with everyone. she also offered to move us when the folks behind us got a bit rowdy but really, you don't go to a bar and expect peace and quiet :-P so we didn't mind at all."}
{"text":"this review is more of an update of one of my longtime goto neighborhood bars. i've come out of my dormant state to make a few points of why i won't be spending as much time here any longer. 1) i dearly loved drinking local craft beer out of a 32 ounce mug. sadly, i recently learned these great mugs have been replaced with 26 ounce mugs. my problem is i'm paying the same price for A LOT less beer...and i wasn't told. 2) after years and years of enjoying delicious meals here, i had never once complained about a meal prior to recently. it was a legitimate complaint and when i brought it to my bartender's attention, i got pushback and that made me feel like a bad guy. 3) just doesn't have the same \"local bar\" feel anymore. the food is still great and they still have a great local craft beer selection."}
{"text":"This place makes me want to come to Phoenix more often.  We came here after an A's Spring Training game because it's right down the street and close to the freeway. I half expected a third of the park to show up because it's one of the closest bars--- and it was happy hour on a Monday. And there was a check-in special. And there's plenty of space.   The place is a bit hard to find. There's not much else around, so it looks like just another office building. Unless you are actually looking for it, you'll completely miss the place. WIN for us!!!! We walked in, and there were 4 other people there. The bartender was the only one working, so we sat ourselves. Then we realized.... it's a bar.... of course you're gonna seat yourself.   The bartender was nice enough to come over with some menus and to take our drink orders. She was SASSY! and I loved it. We ordered a round of beers, our $5 pitcher of liquor (check-in special), and waited. And waited. Other people started meandering in and our bartender got slammed. BOO. But lucky for us, her counterpart came in shortly and helped out.  We ordered Tot-chos (jalapeño tots w/ nacho toppings)- YUMMYYYY!!!! I totally am still craving these. And had to order another order shortly after. I also had the corned beef sandwich---- HOLY CRAP it was the best corned beef sandwich I've ever had in my entire life. So tender. So juicy. And came with tots! The chipotle sauce they add on it was the perfect complement! This is the sandwich I've always dreamed of.   We stayed for a few hours- drinking beer (great beer on tap, BTW), playing pool, playing shuffle board, and taking $1 kamikazes. 'Twas a wonderful monday night.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Dive bar? I guess, but the food, drinks, service and atmosphere are top notch. We ordered their BBQ Bacon Burger, Green Chile Mac & Cheese and Grilled Wings. All were DELICIOUS!!!! Bonus: they have shuffle board and Big Buck Hunter. This bar is legit. I plan on becoming a regular."}
{"text":"I frequeneted here during our A's Spring Training vacation... and I am SO glad we Yelped the area for bars, cuz this is the first bar that popped up + it's a dive, so i felt it was meant to be.  Showed up, got a beer right away, and proceeded to drink the night away for pretty cheap.    great local beer selection and I was astonished that i could get a pitcher of well liquor + mixer for $5 just by checking in at the Draw 10! Also loved that if you go there before an a's game and show them your ticket, you can get a burger, fries + domestic draft for $5!!    and the reason this place gets 5 stars??  two words: SHUFFLE BOARD!!"}
{"text":"Draw 10 is a fun convenient place to hang out if you live in the area.  I have friends who live next door so we frequent it often.  Good deals and good drinks.  Pool tables are also in the back part of the bar.  Overall it is a decent neighborhood bar."}
{"text":"Tegan is a great American & an even better bartender.   Come to D10 when you're looking for solid bar food & a sausage fest. This is just a down-home, feel good dive bar. Like old underwear, it's comfortable & reassuring. But seriously, drinks are reasonably priced, plenty of regulars, & if you're lucky, a pretty girl or two will stumble in.  Edit: I came back to pregame prior to the Mayweather/Pac fight & I was treated poorly by one of the bartenders there. I won't say her name (it rhymes with phalang??)  but she has dark hair, and she wore a hat the night she served us. My friends and I sat at the elbow of the bar. The first question she asked me was, \"Are you going to cause any trouble tonight? I had to kick you out last time.\" I told her no, I've never been kicked out of Draw 10 or any bar for that matter. She kept insisting she had kicked me out. I told her no. Then she said, \"I know I've kicked you out because you & Ryan got too rowdy the other night.\" I told her I don't have a friend named Ryan. She kept insisting that she had kicked me out in the past (at least 4-5 times) & each time I told her no. Now I realize all us Black folks look alike, (I mean I look like Denzel, who looks like Obama, who looks like Danny Glover, who looks like Kid President, who looks like Morpheus from The Matrix. All us look alike, right?) but when someone tells you NO 5 times & you still insist on it, you should probably chill out. Messed up my whole mood for the evening.   Anyway, this used to be a 5-star review until tonight. Tegan is still great, but the rest of these folks need a lesson in customer service.  Last edit: They charged my buddies' card twice that night. He discovered it after checking his account. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Draw 10 is OPEN for business. Has been for a while now! Not sure why YELP has not changed the status. ??? Great place, newly remodeled. Still the same great bar food as always! Karaoke on Saturdays, poker too! You've gotta check it out!"}
{"text":"Loved this dive bar! We watched the patriots kick the Texans asses here last night. The bartender Tim was super friendly and always on top of everything. Good friendly, laid back atmosphere."}
{"text":"The Draw 10 is now open again. The remodel is beautiful. We are excited to have our bar open again!"}
{"text":"This place smells really bad. It's hard to enjoy a beer with it smelling so bad like intense cooking oil. It's decorated like a grandmother's livingroom. This needs a total makeover/'"}
{"text":"Ive driven by this place about a hundred times, but never visited until a friend had here going away party there.  Nice dive bar. Good selection of liquor, the majority of the taps are local too. Theres a pool table, some video games and shuffleboard, if youre so inclined."}
{"text":"On a recent Sunday, mid-day, met up with a few pals staying near the airport. We needed to find a place to catch up in a hurry and I was stumped as to anything real close (not my neck of the Valley). Yelp really didn't help me this time - turned up the bar at the Doubletree which was a joke. One of the guys found this on Google and off we went.  Walked in and thought \"man do we stick out like sore thumbs\" and actually thought about turning around and leaving. Reset my attitude and sat at the bar and was VERY pleasantly surprised. Bartender was awesome, he took great care of us!  Food was good bar food (we stuck with burgers) and a large beer is a LARGE beer. Prices were great (wasn't even happy hour).   I don't know when I became a smug judgmental snob but this place helped knock  me back to my roots and some of the dive bars I frequented back in the day. Only issue was one drunk fellow that would NOT stop yelling at the TV, but it was the Raiders game so I can imagine he's a bit frustrated as a fan :)  So if I'm ever near the airport again and need a place, I'll start here first."}
{"text":"I have been going to Draw 10 for the past 5 years. Great food and great service!"}
{"text":"Pub Crawl Stop 6 (finale):This spot is just down from my office and the only spot that I visited using the light rail for my light rail pub crawl. By this time I was completely hammered and although hungry, I didn't want to wait for the $5 special of burger, fries and domestic beer.  When you consider the domestic beer was $2, that's a good deal for the food - but I just ordered one domestic beer. I can't recall much about this place. I would like to go back when I am not so out of it because I have heard they have good food and great drink specials"}
{"text":"Agree w/previous review... location was \"off\" or better unexpected.  As was the great service (THANKS! CHAD!) and drinks we had during our visit.  The other patrons were very welcoming and we all started up great conversations.  Shuffle board! YES!  This was my first time here and I can say that although it's not on my usual travel routes, I will actually go out of my way to stop by again."}
{"text":"What a great find!  Been here several times now.  Food is awesome and the fact that they are part of Skymiles dining is even better"}
{"text":"This is a good place, if you want your typical 'Cheers' scenario. It's been around for a while (at least it looks like it has). The patrons are sure to let you know (by their volume, not because they actually engage in conversation with you) that they've been there before. The food and service were so so. I think they would have have to step it up a notch if they were located in any other area. But because they are really the only bar around that area they do well, (my opinion). But honestly there are several other places to get better beer, have a good time with coworkers and/or friends, have bigger tvs and a better menu, all within 5-10 minutes from here. But because this is the U.S of 'Murica and you can make your own choice"}
{"text":"Maybe 4 stars. The Mac and green chili was the reason I came. It was good. Not great. Good. Definite hole in the wall. I got the half order and moved on."}
{"text":"Longnecks of Bud are cheap and cold! I like this little bar because it has the right mix of random bastards that you can drink with and punch in the head when you're feeling rowdy.  They got some damn fine hot wings here too... especially the honey chipotle flavor. Do yerself a favor and scarf some down rightquick! Yah!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite new sports/dive bars! They have great drink specials and specials during games ($3 domestics and $5 Burger?). Their weekend brunch menu is absolutely something to die for. I am a vegetarian and my favorite dish here is ofc the Mac & Cheese, which is out of this world! The staff is friendly and the ambiance is decent. The place aint loud and you can actually have a conversation here. oh and they have pool and shuffleboard. Pool is free during weekends?"}
{"text":"The service was ok but we were the only people there so that's to be expected.  The food was terrible and the whole place has an identity crisis.  It's a dive bar that is struggling to be something it's not"}
{"text":"When will I get stabbed? When my buddy wanted to meet up here yesterday that was my first thought. Apparently since the light rail went in this area of town is less bad - it seemed cleaner than I remembered. When I pulled up I was surprised to see so many cars here. Once I made it inside I realized it was dive heaven. I talking about a real authentic old-fashioned dive. Being so close to Tempe (ASU), and with the recent influx of light rail housing the place has a healthy mix of art students, blue collar dudes, business geeks, and drugged-out weirdos. Nice.  Note: Several craft brews on tap.  Advice to owners: The patio needs serious help."}
{"text":"This place is my neighborhood hang out. It is a great dive bar that has great bar tenders who make very strong drinks, which also happen to be reasonably priced. I go here often because its close convienent and a quiet place to get a drink. It is the best place to get drunk and avoid the scottsdale/ Mill ave crowd and also meet some friendly locals. The food isnt have bad either, good wings and burgers."}
{"text":"Draw 10 has become my home away from home. For starters, it's right by the airport, making it a convenient stop just before or after a flight. I moved here from the Midwest and was immediately drawn to this bar because of its small town feel and personalized service. Working for a large, nationwide company,  we often have vendors and/or business partners here on business trips and this is always the first-recommended spot. No, it's not always a lively, happening bar but it also isn't a silent and boring bar; rather it's a comfortable place for anyone looking for a spot to hang out without large crowds and high prices. Ultimately I couldn't be happier with the prices, location, food and service. Highly entertaining and recommended."}
{"text":"Fine place to stop and have a beer.  Just a little bar, tv's and some games.  Johnny Cash seemed to be the theme coming from the jukebox which I had no problem with, it fits the place well."}
{"text":"There is nothing better than going to a city and finding out where the locals hang out. Maybe the only thing better is finding out that they serve good beers, have a jukebox, darts, pool, and a shuffleboard table.   This is a true dive bar minus the obnoxious stench of cigarettes. It is located in a little office space with not much around it. When we pulled up, there were a few bikes located out front. Upon entering, we were all surprised that we could still breathe. It was dimly lit, but overall a very clean establishment. The bartender was so attentive the whole way through. We were not drinking much since we had the race the next day, so we spent most of our time sharing pitchers, playing shuffleboard, and monopolizing the jukebox.   The draw about going someplace new is trying out the different kinds of beer. Some of them were a miss, but we found a few that we liked as well. The prices are very reasonable. The service is unbeatable."}
{"text":"Julie The bartender is amazing. She got us our drinks in a very timely matter and was very friendly and fun. She dealt with rude drunk customers in a professional way and handled about 40 people by herself. We will be back soon because of Julie and btw the food is amazing !!!"}
{"text":"We're back in town for our annual spring training trip.  So of course our first stop for dinner after the game was Draw 10.    Same as previous years in every way.  Good food, good service, god beer list. Had our usual great time.  See you next year!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  good food.  cheap beer.  great local people.  the bartenders are never stingy on the alcohol either!"}
{"text":"Was here for EVFN/ #TechPhx kick-off party. I've never been before, but heard good things. I wasn't disappointed. They always get a room in the back for EVFN, and everyone was so nice, and prompt with taking orders and getting drinks to us. I only had wings, but they were quite good! They also have a good selection of drafts. Good place- I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I would not have thought that a bar like this could be quite so good. Great service, lovely beer selection, Sunday morning football on the TV's, and an extremely decent breakfast. You can't beat the price for their food - really good. The service here was incredibly attentive and breaking up and keeping track of the checks for a party of 10 - you're on the money!!!"}
{"text":"This is such a great bar with good drinks and amazing food! The staff is so nice and attentive, and the vibes are very casual."}
{"text":"A dive bar where booze is cheap and drinks a re strong. It is a good place to go once in a while to get a few drinks and hangout with friends."}
