{"text":"The interior is kind of boring, but I liked the long counter around the restaurant. You can sit there and watch the people on Yonge passing by.  I liked the fact that you can put your meal together the way you like it. Had the thick noodles (not udon - forgot the name) and the sweet orange sauce, with veggies and zoya. I tried zoya for the first time and the texture was more like meat then tofu. But it didn't taste like much. Maybe if they would marinade it, it could be really good.  Been there in the afternoon, so the restaurant was pretty much empty. Quick service and the waiter was nice.  Overall it's ok for lunch but I wouldn't go there for a nice dinner..."}
{"text":"Ordered a ramen where the soup was salty and noodles were undercooked and stuck together. It took a long long time for the food to come out.  All the portions seemed irregular. Some dishes had large portions and some dishes had really small portions eventuough they were around the same price. I ended up ordering dumplings but they tasted pretty nasty... Pretty disappointing....Food trucks have better tasting food than here..."}
{"text":"Love this place. Delicious noodle dishes at decent prices. Very generous servings. You basically create your own meal. Choose a noodle, sauce, meat/unmeat, and stack your bowl full of whatever veggies you want, and they cook it."}
{"text":"This is my first review and the exact reason why I joined Yelp - never again shall I walk in a random restaurant without checking its reviews online! Do the homework even if I'm too hungry to think!!"}
{"text":"It is a bit pricey, but it's nice that you can pick your own vegetables. I opted out of noodles for an extra bowl of veggies with meat."}
{"text":"I had some kind of beef rice thing today and it was pretty good the decor seems to  be kind of drab which seems to be the way it is just south of bloor the restaurants all seem to dark drab and messy"}
{"text":"Pad Thai was not all that amazing. The noodles were slightly sweet, but not in a tangy way. The meat sauce was much more acceptable. All in all, it's something quick if you're in a hurry but not authentic in the least."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch thinking I would try out their ramen noodles. I ordered the miso ramen bowl and shortly after finishing lunch and going back to the office, I felt sick. Ended up making myself puke because I couldn't wait for the food to come up on it's own. Still feel sick now but not at bad as before. I should just stick to authentic ramen noodle houses and not these asian fusion places. I am never eating there again."}
{"text":"I normally don't write reviews but I just had to say this was the absolute worst food I've ever had, possibly in my entire life. The only reason I ended up there was because I was starving, craving ramen, and it was the first spot I saw so I decided to try it out. Service was unbelievably slow and inattentive even though it wasn't very busy. I ordered the spicy ramen. The noodles were undercooked and still stuck together. The boiled egg was overcooked and probably old. There was maybe 2 mini pieces of meat. The broth was bland, not even spicy. I should've just went home and made a better bowl of instant noodles."}
{"text":"Yorkville was just up the block, but my hands were full after buying this exercise equipment, and along with my man purse..that was too far of the walk. I struggled to get between the narrow doorway with my things, as the waitress inside just stood there and watched me squeeze into her restaurant. This was not going to go well.  I sat by the window, the place wasn't as nonchalant as it appears from the outside, but it's not the Ritz. The staff here was nice, and that's as good as it gets. They have this thing where they give you a bowl where you can put a bunch of stuff from their food bar, and they'll cook it up for you along with your noodle. This would have been a excellent option, if your appetite was that of a gerbil. The size of the bowl immediately demands an apology from the staff. That's what I thought anyway watching other people receive theirs, I instead ordered off of the surprisingly Canadian menu. Everything else is very...whitewashed. I was surprised they didn't have chicken balls. But don't worry, they give you a fortune cookie in the end.  I had the pho, ginza dumplings, and spring rolls. It was all good, but I could have gotten all this at Mandarin, or at a food court. Asian Noodley was misleading! I really can't say the food you get here was worth the money. It's just buffet food. With the company of the weirdos that roam about the area.  Judging from the crowd, this seemed to be a place where hipsters come when they've gone broke. This redhead came in during my meal, that's about when I stopped critiquing the restaurant.   Zyng! That's what you'll feel when the bill comes, and you realize that you could have just gone to Buffet King instead. A real authentic Canadian Asian experience..."}
{"text":"Small portion sizes, Over-priced and bland food..About to order food and they say the credit card machine is not working... Very dissapointing.. Will never go back again. Probably among the worst food I bought for $10 + tips.."}
{"text":"It's sometimes unfair to judge a restaurant based on its takeout, but I don't think that even eating in house could have saved my experience. The interior of the restaurant is nicer than the outside, but that is my   The 'choose your own veggies' concept is not entirely unique, but the first time I've seen it done in the area. I was a little puzzled by the set up, but tI suppose the method prevents the \"ew, what is this?\" factor often experienced by some eaters when trying new asian foods.  My order for the night included  'make your own bowl' with the sesame ginger sauce, tom yum gong, and lychees on ice.  Perhaps I was hungry today, but I noted that my 'bowl' was a surprisingly small portion, and had a mere four shrimps. (I'm pretty sure I get more everything, not just shrimp, from Spring Rolls just down the street). The sauce was quite flavourful, but not with the sesame or ginger flavours it was apparently supposed to have. As for the vegetables, I obviously cannot say anything about what was placed in it. I can, however, comment on how the snow peas did not have tough stringy sides removed, and the bamboo shoots tasted like they just came out of the can. The noodles themselves were clumped together in a mass in the middle, but I will give them the benefit of the doubt, and say that it may just be a product of take out (instead of dining in).  The tom yum gong was watery, flavourless, and had canned fruit salad in the bottom. Yes, fruit salad. The kind I used to eat out of a small can when I was in elementary school. To be honest, I doubt I would have recognized it as tom yum gong if I hadn't ordered it myself.   The best part of my order was definitely the lychees on ice, which was simply five canned lychees served cold in their syrup. Good, but again, no extra effort out of the can.   Overall, this meal warrants no more than one star, but I think that the one star belongs to whoever supplies their canned foods."}
{"text":"Definitely NOT authentic!  went there for lunch, ordered a ramen and it's not authentic:  - by looking at the photos on the menu, I expected to get a soft boiled egg, seaweed, instead, I got a hard boiled egg, and it's not even marinated  - no seaweed, instead I got some chopped carrot and broccoli (like chop suey)"}
{"text":"I've got nothing really bad or good to say about this noodle house. It was pretty standard stir-fry fare. I had the Zyng bowl, which is a choose-your-own contents stir-fry. The vegetables were fresh and the chef was uber conscious of the fresh state of said veggies. My dinner partner had the kung pao chicken, and I'm not really certain what he paid an extra dollar for, as his dinner was pretty much the same as mine, sans chicken.  As a positive it was quick, and granted the restaurant was pretty much empty, but it was QUICK! Also for $10.00 my girl palate allowed me to spread the dish to two meals, so really high on the bang for your buck scale. But nothing really stood out.  Bottom line...stir-fry is always fun, but I think I could make this cheaper at home."}
{"text":"Oh where to begin. I'll make this simple. If you want your dining experience to be enjoyable and palate titillated with Asian flavours that will make your toes curl, this isn't the place. Expect the following when dining here:  food is just food, inattentive server, empty water glass, plates will not be taken away when done and not be asked how your meal was. Go across the street to Spring Rolls for a much better meal and dining experience."}
{"text":"AVOID THIS PLACE. We picked a place at random and were already starving, I should have taken the fact it was empty as a bad sign but we were hungry and beyond using logic at that point. Got the takoyaki as an appetizer which was okay, but definitely not the tastiest I've had, and the tonkochu ramen. The ramen was just an embarrassment. Broth was just beyond bland and tasteless. Absolutely nothing stood out about it. Topped with an unmarinated, HARD boiled egg. Wtf? Don't bother. Friend got one of the mix your own bowls and her udon was overcooked, and the spicy thai sauce on it was flavorless aside from spice. No hint of garlic or anything else. Super weird."}
{"text":"I love the \"create-your-own\" noddle dish concept at Zyng.  There are 5 or 6 different kinds of noodles to choose from (my favourite are the thick shanghai noodles), then you pick your protein (beef, chicken, shrimp, tofu, etc...) and sauce (so many from the mild to the gawd damn spicy).  Once you've given your order, you walk over to the veggie bar and fill a small bowl with any type of veggie you want. They have the standard stir fry stuff like snow peas, broccoli and peppers but they also have palm hearts (yum!), water chestnuts and those mini corns, which are quite possibly the most awesome veggie in existence.  It takes a few mins, but the chefs take their time to stir fry your crazy concoction together into a delicious noodly dish with some sawce.  A note on the shrimp: They are tasty and a nice size but I only got 4 of them in my bowl :(  I've tried the beef here before and it's a much better choice. They put way more, it's cut supper thin and it's delicious. Next time I'll order beef instead.  P.S. They will deliver all the way from Landsdown to Pape and from Eglinton to Queens Quay!"}
{"text":"When i want a noodle place that's quick and cheap, I love going to Zyng. It's a no-frills type build-your-own-meal restaurant. You can pop in and sit at the window and people watch, or grab something quick to go.  I'm a picky eater so the choose-your-own-veggies style suits me well. You pick from a selections of noodles, sauces and protein (meat or veg) then grab a bowl and pick your own vegetables. They fry it up quick and serve it hot. I don't find the portion size too small. No need to pile your plate high and stuff your gut. If i'm really hungry i can inhale the whole bowl. But usually i split it into two meals and have the leftovers the next day. I love the Fiery Teriaki sauce!  Overall a great, cheap noodle spot!"}
{"text":"I had forgotten about ever having gone to this place until I walked by it the other day and thought that I could write a review since I have been here before. What a laugh I had when I noticed that the place has an average two star rating. It is well deserved to be honest.  The one time I came here, the food was TERRIBLE! The noodles were so overcooked that I felt them smushing into a paste in my mouth almost before I even started to chew. It was honestly quite disgusting. A quick scan of other reviews suggests that my experience was not an outlier.  I have NO idea how this place has survived for so long? Perhaps having such a premium location so close to Yonge and Bloor would allow almost any business to survive? That being said, a Thai place named Green Mango that was truly one of the best Thai fast food places the city ever had was almost right next door for many years but no longer exists. I still miss Green Mango. I wish it was still around. :("}
{"text":"The quality of food in this restaurant is way below average standard. I ordered Shoyu Ramen and the ramen turned out to be very soggy. Also, the soup base was very bland. Based on my experience with other ramen restaurants, I can tell the ramen served here is not authentic at all. I also ordered gyoza for appetizers. The gyoza was okay but still a little bit pricey.  As for other intangibles, the restaurant wasn't busy yet still took them 10 minutes to serve the food. Overall, this is a very disappointing restaurant."}
{"text":"Whomp, whomp...   This place was just underwhelming. The workers were nice enough, but the food was not good and there's no way to sugar coat it it.  The noodles were mooshy, and the dishes lacked flavour. The portions were fine. Ok if you're in a pinch, but otherwise I'd recommend going elsewhere."}
{"text":"This location was a regular spot for me when I was in university. Six years later, I decided to go relive my past and stop in again. I called in advance to ask what time they close, because nowhere online does it specify (which I found very strange.) They said they close at 9pm. We strolled in around 8:20pm and were greeted horribly. The guy looked at the clock and shook his head, saying they close in 10 minutes. All of the vegetables in the counter were already removed and put away for the night. I told him I specifically called prior to arriving to find out what time they closed, and they said 9pm. So I had 40 minutes. He gave us menus and basically told us to hurry up in not so many words.  I typically get the \"make your own bowl\" and choose my own veggies. I asked the waitress how this would be possible since they were all put away already. She said I would just receive a chef's blend of whatever he chose. I did not like the sound of that, so I got the Chicken Pad Thai and an order of Dumplings.  I would have rated this place 1 star if it weren't for the food. It was just like old times, and the quality was as I remembered it to be. This isn't a 5-star restaurant experience... this is basically \"fast food\" when you want a healthier approach. The service was awful, the inconsistency with the closing times was frustrating, and having 3 staff members staring at you in hopes that you leave ASAP was pretty annoying."}
{"text":"I stopped by Zyng on my way to Spring Rolls for a quick bite to eat, and decided I would give them a shot. I had passed by the place many times, but was curious about their cuisine.  To start with, the restaurant's decor is bland which was the first warning.  Menu options look good, but besides being pricey, the end product was below average. Tom Yum Soup was watery and flavorless. Pad Thai looked nice on a plate, and the presentation was great, but compared to other places in the area, it was bland in flavor.  Prices are high when compared to other pan-Asian restaurants in the neighborhood.  Would I come back again? The answer is no.  Should have stuck with Spring Rolls Go across the street as their plates are flavorful and cost a lot less."}
{"text":"Ended up here because I had intended to go to Kenzo Ramen on Yonge, which may be closed. Anyways, it was not busy at all but I still had to wait 10 minutes for my drink.  The hot sake was tepid. The server couldn't explain the difference between the Chashu Shoyu Ramen (8.95) and the Tonkochu Ramen (9.95). I ended up ordering the Tonkochu, which had some tasty toppings and a slightly cloudy broth. When it came, the soup tasted good. No complaints there. But I had to get them to  point out the pieces of pork in it, because they were not on top as shown on the picture menu. I may come back if I'm in the area,  but honestly you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I've no idea what possessed me to come here for a quick lunch. It's cheap, mock Asian food. But I had a hankering for Thai and came here for fuel to continue the rest of my day. I ordered the Spicy Thai fried rice with beef. It was garnished with bean sprouts, shredded raw carrots and cilantro. The beef was the cheapest cut they could find, possibly gristle. I squeezed all the lemon into it and hoped for the best!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to this place since the mid-1990s. It's obviously changed hands and names over the years. A weird feverish Thursday night turned my Friday date night with The Banker into something of a lame quest for soup or something. I remembered this place. The format is still the same, pick your noodles, etc. Although it's now stir fry, not soups. It's a kind of Mongolian grill without the Mongolian buffet concept.   Service is nice enough. The place is clean, modern, and bright inside. Prices are not unreasonable. Banker thought the veggie bowl was on the small side. But in the mix it all works out.  Nothing horrible. Nothing to blow you away."}
{"text":"When my food first arrived, I thought, oh the portion size is pretty small. I was hungry and expected something bigger for $10 worth of food. After I took a bite, I was glad it was small because there was no way I could finish something that tasted so horrible. How do you even make food taste so bad and rancid? What did you do to it? Do not come here. The hot dog stand on the street is a way better choice."}
{"text":"It's a nice looking place and the food is alright tasting.  But that's about all that is good.  Sure it's a build your own meal kind of thing but definitely the worst I've experienced.  For $10 they give you a small bowl (think miso soup at a sushi place) which you have to pack full of veggies.  They add the noodles and meat after.  Really what's the point of this?  Sure maybe I want more broccoli than sprouts but with such little options and bowl size they might as well just whip me up a stir-fry of their own and save me the effort of getting up from the table.  Any place I've gone to before (i.e. the fantastic Open Sesame in Calgary) has a huge bowl and huge buffet to match where you can choose not only veggies but noodles and sauces as well.  You're definitely not getting your value here for the small portion sizes.  Skip this one."}
{"text":"I actually smelled this place before seeing it, and the scent of warm noodles really attracted me to try it out. Unfortunately the ramen gets a lot of hate at Zyng, so I heeded advice and ordered the make-your-own meal instead. You get a choice of noodles, meat (+$2.00), soup base and vegetables. You can either get your veggies at the self serve counter, or you can get the chef's selection. I chose to get the chef selection, which consists of red + green peppers, mushrooms, bamboo shoots, shredded carrot and Shanghai bok choy.   My friend and I came during lunch time, and the restaurant was quite packed. The waiters vary in attitude- some of them are very nice whereas others kind of ignore you completely. The staff bring you water without even asking, but neglect to fill it when empty. We ordered takoyaki, which is steaming hot and filled with large octopus pieces inside. However, there are no bonito (fish flakes), and they skimped on the mayonnaise. Honestly the takoyaki tasted kind of like fried dough- nothing out of the ordinary.   Our main dishes arrived quite quickly, and we ordered customized bowls of noodles. The udon noodles are soft, not chewy, and the coconut curry soup base is a little weak; it doesn't mix that well with the ingredients. The peanut soup base is very tasty though! I believe the protein is worth getting because you get huge chunks of chicken or an abundance of beef, depending on what you choose. The portions are quite large and I was unable to finish mine, but I do have a rather small appetite.  You have to walk up to the register and pay yourself, but the waiters give you fortune cookies to chew on. It's a little pricey here for the quality, but otherwise a good, casual restaurant to have a quick bite!"}
{"text":"Cheap, fast, and relatively healthy fare. I have been here a few times because it makes my friends and I nostalgic for the make-your-own stir-fry we used to get every week at the cafeteria at university.   The vegetable selection is decent and you can get just veggies, tofu, or various meats. The sauces are a little hit and miss. The spicy peanut is okay, but some of the other ones, like yakisoba sauce are way too salty.   They also have pre-set combos (instead of creating your own stir fry) and appetizers like edamame, yakitori, etc. But I think most people come here for the DIY style.   I don't come here too often anymore as I have found there are so many better options in the area (e.g. 7 West, Okonomi House, Tokyo Kitchen, Gourmet Burger Company, etc.)."}
{"text":"If the price was about 3 or 4 dollars less, you'd see three stars here.  But it's not.  You're looking at $10.00 for a bowl of noodles, with some veggies thrown in.  You can choose to add the vegetables you want, but if you do - you get a small bowl to fill, and you don't end up with much.  Provided you don't hate the \"chef's special\" it's probably best to go with that.  Choose your noodles - choose your sauce - choose your meat.  End of the day, you get a lot of noodles (that are pretty bland) with a lacking amount of sauce (that is pretty bland) and mostly congealed on the bottom of the bowl, away from what you're actually eating.  There are some vegetables though, and that's nice.  It's not the best food - but it's far from the worst.  You do leave full, and that's something.  The location is a good one too, relatively close to Bloor station.  Everything costs a pretty penny up that way.  I was glad to have eaten there, I just wish it was better (or cheaper)."}
{"text":"It was okay. The choose your own bowl is really the only way to go. The sauce was very pineapple-y and the curry tasted kinda cheap. The chicken actually tasted like KFC chicken which is strange. Didn't feel very authentic towards any asian culture, but it was on the healthier side. Overall, the price is way to high in comparison of what you get compared to the other restaurants in toronto like amazing Ramen shops for 9.99 or all u can eat sushi across the street for 11.99."}
{"text":"I stopped by here last week with a few co-workers. I was craving ramen and there isn't many options in the area unless I want to trek down Sansotei on Yonge (which is always an option, but time and the line up is always a factor).  In a pinch where I just don't care, this place will do just fine but this place is not Santoei. The food is just food and isn't much of an experience. I didn't get sick and the place was clean. The service was OK and the food came fast enough.  I've been to worse places but I've also been to better."}
{"text":"Got their pad thai. Unfortunately 80% of the dish tasted like carrots and excess oil. Disappointing"}
{"text":"They use a crapload of spice to cover up the disgusting taste of everything. Ramen was below average, make your own bowl had so much salt in the sauce, and the pork seemed like it came from a prepackaged meal."}
{"text":"I came for my lunch break today. The environment was spacious and they had a nice, friendly greeting. I order a spicy ramen for around $9.95. I wouldn't say it was the greatest ramen for that price. It was a lot spicier than I imagined, but all I tasted was basically \"hot sauce\" and not the miso broth that it should've been in. They also gave a fortune cookie on your way out, which was cute :). Overall, I wouldn't say I would purposely go there again, but it's close to work so I may try something else the next time I'm there!"}
