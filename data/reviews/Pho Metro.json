{"text":"I come here regularly and usually order the Pad Thai or Bun (vermicelli) with shrimp on sugar cane, grilled pork and Vietnamese sausage. 

The Pad Thai is large enough for me to split into 2 meals (but if you're a big eater, you could finish it in one sitting). It's on the sweeter side and not the dry kind. There is a generous portion of meat.

The Bun with shrimp on sugar cane, grilled pork and sausage is good. A good variety and filling. 

The pho is good. Not too salty and the broth is clear, not muddy. 

The owners are friendly and accommodating as we usually come with a large group."}
{"text":"Finally a decent pho place in Markham! 
After living in downtown Toronto, and being spoiled by the likes of Golden Turtle, we were sad to discover there was nothing remotely close to being authentic Viet Pho. Luckily, this place opened up nearby, and their food is delicious and authentic. They're very generous with their meat, basil and bean sprouts, both the Pho and Bun are a good choice here. I wouldn't say it is as good as Golden Turtle, but for Markham, this is as good as it's gonna get."}
{"text":"Pros: spicy beef pho was great, very cheap, server was very friendly

Cons: rundown place, didn't look very clean, server doesn't speak English it seems"}
{"text":"Originally we went to Pho Metro based on a recommendation from a friend.  And we've been coming back ever since.  This is a nice little restaurant that we had passed by many times in the past not realizing the treat that was waiting inside.  Do yourself a favor and stop by for a bite.  The service is quick and there is this one particular server, a lovely young gentleman who went above and beyond to provide a very helpful and courteous atmosphere. 

It goes without saying, but the food is phenomenal and the prices are very friendly to your wallet.

{"text":"Had Pho here for the first time.
Its pretty decent but nothing to get super excited about.
The place was nice, service was good and it was not expensive."}
{"text":"First time eating here. I ordered a medium size pho with grilled chicken...with side order of more grilled chicken...great flavours. Also had the shrimp/pork fried spring roll, was amazing with the sauce...eat this after it cools down, tastes amazing. My friend enjoyed the beef brisket pho with tom yum ... meat was cut nicely with no excess fat... definitely will go back here"}
{"text":"I'm really excited to have a decent pho restaurant in my neighbourhood.  The prices were decent and the bowls of pho were served with a very generous amount of meat!  I would definitely go back again.  There were lots of other dishes that I saw being brought out that looked delicious!"}
{"text":"Start off by saying that I starting going here when they first opened and it was great to finally have good Pho in Durham.  Was here on this date and was looking forward to soup but didnt get any.  There was no clean tables and the sign displayed was seat yourself.  When I asked the server if she could clean my table I was given attitude.   I walked out the door and wont return ever again."}
{"text":"The last time i was here, was over 1.5 maybe 2 years ago.  The food was not bad but they were pretty tight with the amount of meat in their soup based items.  

Fast forward to February 2015, ordered bun bo hue and i was pleasantly surprised.  The amount of meat they gave was pretty generous today.  Made me pretty happy, good job.  The soup could've been a little more spicy but than again, i eat very spicy. 

The spring rolls was a different story.  They were the size of my middle finger, no joke.  I think they need to find a way to stuff them up more.  

Didn't get a chance to order anything else here tonight but, took a peek over to the table beside us and saw the pork chop rice dish.  The actual pork was sliced pretty thin and a bit small.

Will i come back... a bit far for me.  But this is probably the best Viet restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"I was ecstatic to here that a Pho Metro opened in Markham after enjoying dishes from their Scarborough location. Today, I ordered a medium P12 and a small A1 for take out, which totaled to about $15. The workers were nice and friendly, and my food was ready in a timely manner. However, when I started eating, I couldn't help but notice how oily the broth was and even with the added satay sauce, how bland it was. The spring rolls, on the other hand, were crunchy and yummy. I'll be back for those lol"}
{"text":"Having tried many Vietnamese pho places, this spot definitely didn't disappoint. The house special pho came with a good amount of meat and delicious broth which explains why there are so many seated tables and returning customers. The service was good and overall food was satisfying! Highly recommend if you're in the Scarborough area."}
{"text":"Been here over 4 times, and never had a problem with them. Food is always consistent, very flavourful and quantities are great. Service is great as always, even when it gets super busy, they're still very polite and attentive. We usually go around opening, so around 11:20 on a weekday, and by the time it gets to 11-45, the restaurant is always almost packed"}
{"text":"Recently moved so I am discovering an entirely new (to me) area of restaurants! We needed a quick dinner on a weeknight and decided to give this restaurant a try. This plaza has a few restaurants only but this was the only one that was full (impressive for a weeknight). 

We ordered: 
- pork and assorted seafood noodle soup: broth was clear but had plenty of flavour with a generous amount of seafood and meat in it. 
- tomato and crab noodle soup: broth had a slight tomato flavour to it and was topped with some sliced meat, meatballs and tofu puff. The meat balls had a crab flavour to it, which contrasted nicely to the tangy broth. 

Both noodle soups weren't overly salty, which I always appreciate. Service was prompt and friendly. Will definitely come back to try their other dishes!"}
{"text":"TLDR: Portions were really small and dishes were shallow - was not full at all (was more like a snack), but the taste was there. 

One of the lady's who helped us out was very polite and she was viet! 

For the vermicelli, portion was small, dish was shallow, and half of the bowl was the lettuce and carrots. (Pic is from when I just mixed in the sauce)

For the rice, hard on the outside and soggy in the middle... the meat was very spread out and was a little dry. Good seasoning though.

Overall, wouldn't come back for the price per portion. Place is relatively nice and clean - menus, chop sticks and tea cups were sticky but that's expected."}
{"text":"I personally have very lot standards for food already so I don't expect much. I've been to pho metro many times and this will be my last! Service was never good(expected) however what got me so upset this time was potion. I understand there's \"inflation costs\" however cutting your potion size for your Bun Vermicelli to bite size is not right! I ordered their B6 Grilled Chicken and Spring rolls w/vermicelli & vegetables . Not only was the ONE spring roll was burnt but so badly the skin is falling off. The chicken was less then 2 ounces by weight and the vermicelli was no more than one rice bowl. I asked one of the gentlemen hat works here and he claims this has always been the same eventhough I just had this two weeks ago. This is just very poor business management."}
{"text":"I've been to 4 different pho restaurants in the scarborough area and this one is the best. The broth and portions are great.  I recommend this place to family and friends!"}
{"text":"Not sure where all these great reviews are coming from. Average at best. Obviously this is a decent place for the neighbourhood but if you want some real good pho go across pmall to Kimpo or to Pho Vietnam at midland and finch. To make this easier to understand, would you rather catch a Weedle (this place) or would you rather catch a Lapras (every other pho place in Toronto)?"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Decent food portion. Love this interior is neat and clean with big TV. Staffs are okay. Their tea tastes so good. I had vermicelli with grill beef, i couldn't finish so i packed it home. Even it's cold it tastes amazing!! It can get crowded during weekends but its definitely my fav pho place in this neighborhood."}
{"text":"My wife and I had Pho. It was alright until my wife noticed a piece of hair in the soup, she picked it up with her chopstick and it was obviously a pubic hair, she was disgusted and couldn't eat the rest. We showed the waiter and he looked pretty embarrassed. All he offered was free spring rolls on our NEXT visit. Are you kidding me!?"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of spicy food so I got the spicy pho and it did not disappoint! The food seemed pretty authentic and the drinks were also quite nice. Location is pretty good but they can get busy. The pricing is definitely affordable. Definitely going to come back here - this might become my new go-to pho restaurant."}
{"text":"We ordered the pho lunch combos (any small size beef pho/1 spring roll/ pop or water) with the house special pho. The noodles were awesome and the soup was good but the size was pretty small (bowl and spring roll- forgot to take a picture oops). Plus side - service was great/food was quick/ noodles were fresh. Not so plus side - a bit pricey for portions. $9.50 for the lunch combo vs. regular small beef pho $7.25"}
{"text":"Very good bun vermicellii, spring rolls and pho, As advertised. Gets decently busy and can understand why"}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be one of our favourite pho places for the last several years until today. Unfortunately, we found used limes mixed in with our bean sprouts. The only explanation I can think of is that the bean sprouts and limes must have been reused from another customer and simply mixed in with our order. We are unsure if this was simply a mistake, but it is unhygienic and unacceptable."}
{"text":"I enjoy going to this location for the chicken pho. The chicken breast cuts are a nice touch to the pho soup unlike the \"chicken bits\" (as I refer to them) found at most locations. The portion size is just right and I don't feel over full like I do from other pho restaurants. 

The atmosphere and the staff are great. I always feel welcome there and I always look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Vietnamese restaurant in the greater metro Toronto area. Great tasting food, generous portion sizes, and owners and staff are super friendly. I just wish I lived closer to this restaurant so that I could eat here more often."}
{"text":"The pho was pretty good, but the strawberry milkshake was nothing to write home about.

The restaurant is also cleaner than most other pho places I've been to, and the tables are a good size; you're not cramped or crammed into a tiny space like at other restaurants.

The waiters are nice but not incredibly attentive; it takes a bit of time to get their attention and get service.

I got the pho with beef flank (small), and the soup base was pretty tasty, and was nice and hot.  It was also a good size."}
{"text":"I usually come to this place for lunch whenever I feel like to have a perfect bowl of Vietnamese noodle soup (Pho). Tasty, tasty and tasty... I like its soup base and it makes me feel ENERGY Recharging every time!!! The restaurant atmosphere is always cozy and it also provides friendly and satisfactory service..."}
{"text":"General - great authentic food in Scarborough.  We used to travel out to Keele and Wilson area for authentic.  No need to make the far drive anymore after finding this place.

Environment - exactly what you expect from a Vietnamese owned restaurant

Food - very authentic pho that doesn't leave you thirsty an hour later.  Has all the basics plus Vietnamese specialty dishes that not all Vietnamese restaurants in the city have.

Service - extremely fast and efficient staff.  Can see the owners/managers delegating from behind the counter.

Pricing -  with in range of all other Vietnamese restaurants in the city"}
{"text":"Came based on reviews.  We had to wait a bit during peak dinner hours. Rare beef pho very fresh and thinly sliced, great quality. Soup was flavourful and non-fatty. Great broth and will definitely visit again for a quick eat. Spring rolls were decent, will probably order again all meat no fillers."}
{"text":"This is my favourite restaurant in Ajax, and actually my fave Vietnamese place in the GTA.  So glad to have found it so close to home, having moved to Ajax only a year ago where I feel there are mostly chain restaurants, but then, I'm still learning the area.  I eat here almost every week or two and I recommend the vermicelli bowls... I get cravings for this all the time!  Spring rolls (both fried and fresh) are great!

 The place is clean and modern, food and ingredients are fresh and the quality is fantastic.  Tastes great!!! Portions are huge and prices reasonable!  I think the service is good but expect to seat yourself and pay at the counter.  friendly staff... Just wave them down when you need them!   

Love it."}
{"text":"Had their grilled pork vermicelli - the pork is tasty but sliced really thin. The vermicelli was good, soft and tender. 
Rare beef pho - delicious broth and it came with a big plate of bean sprouts and a whole stem of basil leaves. The beef was tender and not fatty at all. 
Best of all to end the meal - their wicked ice coffee with condensed milk!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time coming to this phò restaurant. 

I ordered the grilled beef and spring rolls with vermicelli & vegetables and I have to say my meal was just meh. The food came quickly which I found kind of odd (quicker than usual), but ok cool. I got the impression that my plate had been reheated. The meat didn't taste too fresh and it had a lot of chunks of fat. 

The salad had no dressing on it, it was just bland. My plate did come with some fish oil on the side that I could add to my food, but I choose not to do so.

Overall the experience was ok. Not sure if I would go out of my way to come here again. I may stick to my old phò place. 

In terms of service, I have no complaints : the staff was very friendly and took our order right away. Prices are very decent for what your are getting as well."}
{"text":"One of the best Pho places in Markham. It is very affordable. Their large pho bowl is under $10. Great for lunch and dinner. 

The food comes out very quickly and the servers are very nice."}
{"text":"Cold and Bland. Ordered Vermicelli noodle with Chicken and some shrimp appetizer. The noodle was cold and the entire plate lacked any flavor. The shrimp was oily and slimy. Not what we were hoping for at all. There are several places within a short drive that are much better. Not worth trying."}
{"text":"Food is great except the portion. It could be better.  Restaurant is well maintained. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Literally 5 minute drive from our office. I love the noodles here. We visit here about once or twice a month for lunch or dinner. 

Everything reasonably priced, service is fast. I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Wow!  So excited we have a good Vietnamese restaurant so close to our house. Lovely staff, great food."}
{"text":"Overall:
3.5 stars

Parking:
Not bad at 12pm on a weekday. 

Service:
I had 30 minutes for lunch, so I was hoping to get in and out quickly. I was seated promptly with my order taken reasonably fast as well. 

Food:
I had the B lunch special (grilled chicken, fried egg, spring roll and white rice) and a drink. Food came quickly, was nice and hot, and flavour was spot on. The chicken was slightly on the saltier side, but if you eat it with rice it evens out just fine.

Impression:
My first time here. I came in here for a quick lunch on the way to work. It was refreshing to know that there's a decent Vietnamese restaurant up in my neck of the woods in Markham. I'll be back to try their pho next time :)"}
{"text":"I am a pho-aholic...I literally eat it everyday! This place was okay, but it just didn't have the wow factor. I still vote for Little Saigon @ Yonge & Weldrick for their Pho and rolls."}
{"text":"Tried the place since its about 5minutes from my place..
The interior looks pretty good... 
There was no sign of the restaurant name...i.e they didn't have their signs up..so it took a whole lot of driving around..

Anyways when we did sat down to eat ..
I found plastic in my pho..which could have been a wrapper for the meat ..

Overall
Wasn't a good experience"}
{"text":"It's 3.5.

We had:

P1-House Special beef noodle (medium-$8.25): Good fresh noodles, good soup base, beef was okay, good beef balls.  Rating: 3.5/5

B4a-Vermicelli with grilled beef and spring roll ($10):  Good soft vermicelli, good tasty grill beef, spring roll was nice too.  Rating: 4/5

Avocado smoothie ($4.25):  This was okay.  Added milk/dairy.  Rating 3/5"}
{"text":"1) Overpriced for the portion size. $7.5 for a 'Large' pho that is equal to a medium in most restaurants. Don't let the pictures fool you, the bowl might be big but 80% of it is soup.

2) Soup was way too salty and not enough pho flavour (such as star anise and other spices used in pho) it seems like they were trying to mask the lack of spices with extra salt.

The only good point is the atmosphere which is very new and fancy for a pho place and the service which was very courteous probably because it's new. I will never go back though because the food was sub par to say the least."}
{"text":"I had Beef Rare Noodles (P2) which is usually what I order whenever I'm at a Pho place. Beef was a little bit on the tough (old) side. Broth was good. Noodles were good overall."}
{"text":"the deep fried spring rolls were great.
pho tasted a bit plain, probably because there wasn't too much msg
service was good"}
{"text":"I don't know why this place has bad reviews.

The food is decent. It's all pre-made ingredients at the back and when you order they assemble your pho and you get your food quickly! 

I personally enjoy P4 - chicken pho with breast meat. I usually ask for the satay sauce on the side since it's nice and spicy.

I also like the chicken rice roll, but I wish there was a chicken spring roll instead. The menu is a little limited for a pho place.

The place is clean. The staff are fast and very sweet. 

The downfall - it seems all of Ajax comes here when they're sick. There's always someone coughing or blowing their nose. That being said, there are always families here with children and they seem fine. I usually sit far away from the sick people and I wipe the utensils before using them."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant to go to for pho.  The service is fast and friendly and the restaurant is pretty clean.  Their pork chop is very flavorful and I really enjoy their spring rolls.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone that's looking for a nice hot bowl of soup to beat the bitter cold outside."}
{"text":"An amazing place to be.  Excellent customer service and huge portions with a good price."}
{"text":"My family and I discovered this little gem last spring and have gone for dinner there at least once a month to date.  So far, everything that we've ordered there has been quite good - my favourite is the grilled chicken.  Food is flavourful, service is always good and servers are friendly.  Place is small and cozy.  Noticed lately that there are more people dining there so it's getting busier.  I guess word has spread about this hidden gem.   Hopefully the quality will stay the same.   This is a must try for anyone that enjoys their Vietnamese food.  Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"My favourite pho place in Markham.  The broth is flavourful and doesn't leave you thirsty hours after. 

Portions are good and the service is great."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a decent pho place in Markham, and I think I've finally found it! I had their rare beef pho. The soup was clean, and flavorful. The small costs $6.45, and each size bigger is $1 more. The service was really great, and food arrived very quickly, despite being moderately busy. They allow you to collect Vincinity points, and even have wifi! I will definitely go back to try their goi cuon (rice rolls), fried spring rolls, and vermicelli!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Love love love this place . The pho broth is delicious, the pork chops, the noodle bowls the pad Thai - you seriously can not go wrong with anything on the menu. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Passed by the area during the late afternoon and decided to visit Pho Metro since Yelp had some good reviews for this place.  I liked the environment as it was very clean and quiet and service was friendly.

Our party ordered a large house special pho (P1) and a house special steamed vermicelli with grilled chicken, pork, grilled vietnamese pork sausage, grilled beef with vegetables (S1).  Portions were huge and we shared them among 3 people.  Both dishes were very solid and delicious."}
{"text":"small portions... awfully small spring roll... for a pho shop that have that long of a wait time for food is a little ridiculous. service isn't amazing... size is smaller than others in toronto. and honestly over $10 for a bowl of pho that is smaller and more expensive than competition... that just don't sit well with me..."}
{"text":"I'm so happy to find a pho place only 10min away. It's a clean place with good food. I just moved from toronto to Whitby so i was surprised that they had a pho restaurant close by. The service was ok. Don't  expect a nice smile when you send your order but that's  typical service at these  kinds of restaurants. The food was good, the decor was modern and clean. I would definilty come back when i get my next craving for Vietnamese noodle. Try their thai coffee for a nice sweet pick me up."}
{"text":"The food is mediocre at best. The service is terrible. A taxi could have picked me up faster than the server coming to my table the way I was trying to wave one down. I think the servers purposely ignore patrons. Not a place I would want to visit again."}
{"text":"I am in Toronto for the week and I wanted to have a bowl of pho.  This was a great place for a bowl of pho.  I had the rare beef, which was excellent.  I also had the shrimp rice paper rolls for an appetizer.  Great little place with friendly service.  I will definitely return here."}
{"text":"The beef pho is really good here! Everything tastes very fresh and just cook the right way! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"2 out of 5 because food is fairly good and coconut bubble tea is the best (made of frozen coconut chunks blended with their special recipe). But found hair on our mango salad twice now. Once there was a strand, second time there were 2 small strands (looked like from a scrubber)"}
{"text":"First and last time here

Food: 0.5/5 
Decent size but food was bland, the broth was watered down AND HUMAN HAIR FOUND IN FOOD*** 

Staff: 2/5 
Waitress was nice but owner has a temper and an attitude problem

Service: 0.5/5 
Took forever to get their attention for condiments, questions and orders (it wasn't busy). Owner made it seem like it was a bother for me to call the waitress over in the middle of their conversation. Reported hair in food and did not receive a single apology, just plenty of attitude."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst restaurant experiences I have ever had. Very disorganized, horrible customer service and the food was barely ok. I ordered a chicken and rice stirfry and it was so spicy it was barely edible (and I like spicy dishes). My boyfriend had the beef with noodles and the beef was almost transparent, very strange looking with an odd texture. My boyfriend ordered a beer from their menu and the waiter advised that they don't have a license for it so he couldn't have that. I ordered an iced tea and they came back 10 mins later and said they had no iced tea. We settled for water and our (little) plastic cup was not offered to be refilled at all. When I asked for more water she brought a plastic jug of water to the table and said 'oh did you want ice'. I said no just wanting to get out of there at that point, and the water was nearly warm. This was the worst $30 I ever spent."}
{"text":"This has been my go to pho place since they've opened many years ago....All because of a Groupon deal.  If not for that I don't think I would have explored that part of Scarborough for pho!  My usual dishes are pho with the rare beef or vermecelli with grilled pork and fried spring roll! I also enjoy their shrimp and pork wrap with the peanut sauce.  Another must order is the ice coffee with condense milk if you are there. Or the mango slushie! My girls love that! Service is great and friendly. Food is served quickly and great for family lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Let's me start by saying that we should listen to one of the viewers from VietFun who concluded that there was not a decent Vietnamese restaurant in Toronto. By the 3rd day of our stay in Toronto (in the Greater Toronto Area or GTA), we pretty much gave up on the idea of eating viet food.

We found Pho Metro from tripadvisor with over 4-star rating. The place was bustling with activities and customers (mostly Asian-Canadian) which is usually a good sign. My \"pho ga\" came out wih the only choice of bbq chicken on the menu. What's up with that--pho ga with bbq chicken? My side disk of veggie which would always accompany Pho orders, was a small portion of bean sprouts and exactly 1 small branch of basil leave. Wife ordered \"Banh hoi Chao tom thit nuong\" but she ended up leaving most of the shrimp and meat behind. My \"Sinh to Mang cau\" was more like buba tea mang cau. \"Nuoc dua\" or Coconut drink was from the cans and not from fresh coconut which was readily available in Toronto.

Perhaps, this is the standard of Viet Canadian restaurants here in Toronto, but we have been to many places including Vietnam, Paris, London, Little Saigon of California, Houston of Texas, Eden center of Virginia, etc...and they all measured up to the same standard of Viet food. 

It's hard to believe that this place gets 4 stars overall from viewers.  Vietnamese food here is NOT authentic nor good.  

Toronto, CA does have great chinese food (HongKong style) and it can easily measure up to any other cities. We even found one opened 24/7 serving great Dim Sum and chinese food. So, stick with Chinese food (Hongkong cooking) while you're in Toronto."}
{"text":"For the area this restaurant is located in, I'd say this place is pretty good.  Been here couple of times, soup base varies, sometimes it tends to be a little on the bland side.  However, the last few times I've been here has been good.  Good portion of meat unlike few others who tend to cheap out on the meat.

I'm pretty sure there are many better viet noodle places out there, I've tried over 10 of them around the GTA area and this one is probably on the middle of the scale.  But when you're looking at north of 16th/unionville area then this one is definitely the one to try!

Service is great and I think they are family owned and operated so that helps a lot with the service.  This place is also very clean which can't be said for many other viet noodle places.

We normally come here for quick lunch/dinner when we do not feel like driving south into core Markham/Richmond Hill or Scarborough area for food, traffic is light north of 16th ave and lots of parking spot.

It's really catering towards people who live in the area, people wouldn't drive far just to come here , it's not that type of restaurant.

Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Always wanted to eat here because every time we drove by it was packed.  Well, we were not disappointed.  The spring rolls and beef main dinner were excellent.  Fortunately, the line up started after we were seated."}
{"text":"Love this photo place. Soup is tasty!  There are small things about this restaurant that takes it above other pho restaurants:
- it's always clean!
- the broth is clear looking and not too salty
- veggies and herbs that come with the pho are always fresh looking 
- friendly staff
- fresh spring rolls are tasty and so so fresh 
- and always clean...it's worth a second mention"}
{"text":"I had the rare beef pho this Monday. Beef was like shoe leather. I 've been to all 3 locations including this one and was always good. Maybe this was a one off or is this location going downhill??"}
{"text":"Went with my friend at his suggestion saying this was one of the best Pho in Scarborough.   Once we ordered the lunch special Pho and tried the Pho, it definitely was one of the best I've had. You can pick any one of the Pho combos on the menu for the lunch special which includes a drink and fried spring roll.   
Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Best vietnamese restaurant in Markham, good service and reasonable price. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Came here with the wife on valentines day and it was pretty good. Nice broth and great portions. Good service. My only gripe and why this is not a 5* was because we ordered a fried  banana dessert and waited 30 mins for it. We ended up taking it to go and thank god it was -30 cause the ice cream would have melted. Next time just give peeps a heads up so they can make a move. I asked the waitress twice and both times it was coming very soon. Come for the food thoguh for sure. Drinks are a bit overpriced. On a cold winter day this place will warm your bones. Average decor so don't let the fact that I came for vday make you think its a romantic spot."}
{"text":"\"IF PHO METRO DONT TRUST U IMMA SHOOT U\"!!!  Shoutout the FutureHendrix listeners... Line out the door on a Friday night around 9pm. Small place with about 15 tables. Line moved quick, many staff so service is decent. Ordered the P7 which is rare beef and tripe. Came within 5 mins. Tea provided. Brother 4/5. Meat quality 4/5. It was actually rare as listed which is A+. Huge portion of noodles for the medium. Broth still does not compare to Pho Hung in Mississauga, and freshness of greens at ILovePho.  Overall. 4/5"}
{"text":"The pho here has none or barely any MSG which is rare to find! The basil, mint and bean sprouts are so fresh. I am not a huge fan of the bun but the pho is amazing. They give a great amount of meat and vegetables. This place is also very clean and baby friendly. They have a real wooden diaper changing table in the washroom. The service is great, I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I had the rice, with chicken, pork chop, and pan fried egg. Portion was excellent, they didn't overfill the takeout box with rice like many other places do. Taste of the food was pretty good, right amount of char on the meat. It was busy during lunch hours, which is a good thing! I would come back, to eat the rice again or try their pho!"}
{"text":"Pho Metro is a consistent restaurant that delivers on quality pho that meets the Torontonian tastebuds for the Vietnamese dish. I ordered a spicy soup during my visit and it is definitely one heck of a pho! It has a strong aroma that packs a strong flavorful soup  with just the right amount of spice. Next door to Pho Metro, they have expanded their business into the Ban Mi branch, taking over the next door restaurant space. With solid service along with quality product, it is no wonder that Pho Metro has grown and shows promise to continue expanded in the future."}
{"text":"There are barely any decent Vietnamese restos in Markham but this place had high ratings so I brought my dad and husband and we were not disappointed! We ordered bun bo hue, special beef noodle and pork chop/grilled chicken with rice and a coconut slushy. Overall a quite satisfying meal but the porkchop was comparably thinner than most places but that wouldn't stop me from coming back to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"To feed my Vietnamese food craving, I decided to search up the best spots around me and Pho Metro seemed to have the best reviews. We went my aunt's family so as a group of 8, it's hard to find a place that satisfies all out needs. However, Pho Metro seemed to cater to each of our needs and that's a rare find. 

We just decided to get a bunch of different dishes and try it out. The deep friend spring rolls were perfect to start off with and for our main course we decided to go with the Pad Thai, the Vermicelli bowl, the Pork Chop Rice Dish, the Pho and the Fried Rice. Overall, the quality was great and the quantity is perfect for family style. The Pho in particular had a great soup base and the meat was great. For the pad Thai, the noodles always seemed to be clumped together which I thought was odd. The vermicelli bowl was what fed my craving and the beef in it was just perfectly flavoured. 

What really made me fall in love with this place is the service. Although it's a small family business, the young waiter we had was just a bundle of joy to deal with. He was very helpful and just had an awesome personality. When we under-ordered one of the apps, they had no problems getting us another one right away.

One thing that I did find as an issue was with the Pad Thai, it seemed cold when they brought it out and that seemed a little odd. Not sure if they had just prepared it or it was done a little earlier so hence I gave the 4 stars. I would definitely come back here and I would recommend it to anyone else as well."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! If you're looking for an authentic Vietnamese cuisine with great service and friendly faces, this is the place for you! 

1) Pineapple fried rice 
This fried rice is one of the best that i've ever tasted. My friends and I come to this restaurant just for this dish. It's sweet and tangy flavour is balanced out by the meat and the savoury rice. 5/5

2) Pad Thai
Sweet and sour noodles topped with yummy tofu, your choose of protein and many other vegetables. Very delicious! However, sometimes there isn't a lot of noodles but a lot of bean curds. 4/5

3) Pho (P2) 
Standard pho, nothing special. Still very tasty! 4/5

4) Spring rolls 
Extremely tasty! Not too oily, it's just right. 5/5

5) Mango smoothie 
Fresh mangos blended together into a sweet and delicious smoothie. 5/5"}
{"text":"Food was good.... small restaurant..kind of dark... need more charm and or decoration... service is ok...not slow...not fast... its okay..."}
{"text":"So I like Pho. I like pho that is made by the Vietnamese. Pho Metro is one of only a few in the Scarborough area that I would say is truly Viet. The broth is tasty and can definitely tell they didn't overdo it with the spices. Meat and food portion was fair. It didn't take long for them to get the order out and served.

The restaurant itself is not too big and is constantly busy due to its popularity. 

Also what was order was Bun Rieu. Crab paste soup. It wasn't as good as how I usually would have it. Soup was a little salty. Good thing about it is they give you a lot of the pork balls and meat. I want to see more crab/shrimp paste in it.

Pricing overall is fair. Location is not bad except it is a bit ghetto around there.

I hope they push franchising as I would like to see them grow."}
{"text":"This is my favourite pho place in Scarborough ! Definitely recommend the bun rieu here"}
{"text":"One of the great taste pho place in Toronto!
Their pho is so tasty!!:)

And service is good.

Cash pay only."}
{"text":"Not the best but one of the good ones, the broth is better than pho saigon (the one i always go to), more noodles, and generous with meat too. The spring roll is good one of their best seller. Server are friendly and doing their best with english and the reataurant is very welcoming. Location is great specially if your taking transit in winter time, the plaza is just in the corner of warden and lawrence saouth east side. I will definitely go back and bring my friends"}
{"text":"Average pho but one of the better flavoured broths. The vegetable spring roll is good. Only downside is the broth is Not very hot but rather warm bordering on needing to be sent back."}
{"text":"I visited with a friend after reading a positive review. The price is higher than other places, but definitely worth every dollar.
I ordered the house special pho. The large size was just right for me. The meat tasted very good and it also came with two different types of herb. The soup tasted great, and I felt the noodles were harder than other places but did not interfere with the overall quality of the dish.
What interfered was the weird smell around the table I sat. It smelled like a bathroom, so I had to wonder if someone spilled some fish sauce and no one cleaned it. I went to the washroom, and I found out that it did not have hand soap. I would like to believe that it is just this one time, and that the restaurant usually keeps things clean and smelling fresh. For now I would like to recommend the restaurant with a 4-star rating for great-tasting food. I would like to visit again in the future."}
{"text":"Sugoi ne! The chicken wings are so good. Impressively good... like I could probably easily eat 20 of them in one sitting good. I'd love to know their recipe :P. Great pho too! This place is definitely recommended."}
{"text":"My friends and I were in the area and wanted a quick pho fix, after a quick Yelp search we discovered metro pho. And one of my friends mentioned to went to another location and said it was good so we have it a try. 

Location wise it's far for myself, but is located amongst a residential area. The storefront itself is clean and presentable. Staff were courteous.

Food wise is where I'm a little iffy. I ordered the bun (dry vermicelli with grilled meat) and although it looked really good, and came in a giant bowl (to make it appear like I was getting a large portion) the meat was too salty and the fish sauce was too sweet! 

I prefer more natural flavours and didn't really get that feeling from this bowl of bun. It was also 2.00 more expensive than if you were to get this dish at a mom and pop vietnamese restaurant. My friend also noticed that the prices at the other location were significantly cheaper. Both are located in the GTA so they should stick with the same prices! 

It was good, would I return there for my next hangover and I need a good bowl of pho? Probably not!"}
{"text":"I work in this area and I really only have 2 Vietnamese options that I know of. Pho Metro or Pho Saigon.

I'd rather choose Pho Metro.

It's not exactly the best Vietnamese food I've had, but it's pretty high up there. I ordered (from what i can recall) a large order of fried spring rolls, which were awesome! A rice dish with grilled chicken and a fried egg. And a coconut milkshake. Both delicious!

Great flavours all around, and it's well priced. I've yet to still try the pho here, and telling by the reviews it's phenomanal! 

I will for sure be coming back here when my next Vietnamese craving rolls around."}
{"text":"Love this place! I've been passing by this place for years and only walked in last year. By far my most favorite Pho restaurant, the owners even know me by now! 

Love their portion sizes, they're huge, and the spring rolls are a must! Their prices are very reasonable and I love how they offer a lunch menu, it's more worth it that way. Lunch menu provides a medium bowl of soup/pho, one spring roll, and a choice of a smoothie, ranging from about $10.25-$12.00. 
Love their smoothies too; highly recommend mango or avocado!"}
{"text":"Taste very nice. My Vietnam frds said still not authentic enough. The smoothy taste great and seems like a good deal"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the pho here, especially the satay beef pho. It used to be spicier and I find they have toned it down a bit, I wish they didn't but understand that it needs to accommodate those who can't have as spicy. Have tried a few other dishes: spring rolls, bun bo hue and viet coffee etc. Overall I would say for most things they are at least on par with the other pho places I would frequent.  

The servers are usually very friendly and strike up conversations when its not too busy. 

I would frequent this place since I have random cravings for their satay pho specifically."}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical just because I'm used to eating from authentic pho restaurants. But after coming here I realized that this place is just that. 
Pho metro is a small shop that is tucked away in a small residential plaza. 
The food is very good. 
The service is fast and friendly. 
The quality of their extras is as fresh as you can get. 
I would definitely recommend this to anyone. 
I will definitely be coming back for more"}
{"text":"Not a Pho expert by any means but I LOVE this place. Generous portions, clean space, and delicious Pho. We generally go for the veggie Pho and ask for extra bean sprouts and basil. They present everything so nicely and are very helpful with the menu, especially for Pho newbies like us. It's always pretty busy, even on weekdays. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because of the price point. 

Price: 3.5/5
Food: 4.5/5
Ambience: 4/5
Service: 4/5"}
{"text":"Pho was the only thing this restaurant got going for them. It's authentic. Other than that their Bún Bò Hu (#66) and #99 Rice dish were a huge disappointment. The BBH noodles were not cooked thoroughly (even our 9 years old said they were chewy). The BBH broth was just plain broth with lots of red food coloring called du ?iu. The grilled pork for the rice dish was chewy and lacking marinated flavours. Overall the food did not live up to their much higher prices compared to the other Vietnamese restaurants. Their BBH was $9.50 and the rice dish was $10.75. XLarge Pho (#35) was $11.95. Yikes!"}
{"text":"I've ordered take out from here and for the first time ate in the restaurant. This small establishment was great. The place was packed for a Saturday afternoon but not so packed that we had to wait. The staff were very friendly and on point. My Pho was amazing, especially after I tried a soup I've never had before. Very tasty!"}
{"text":"There are hardly any notable restaurants in the plaza, or indeed, in the area, which is why the general rating for Pho Metro is higher than my experience here.  

The restaurant is fairly spacious and clean and includes a large variety of condiments and sauces on the table.  We ordered two different noodles in two different soups but found both soups to be bland.  On top of this, the meat was very tough.  We ordered a coffee which was forgotten and way too sweet.  This is made up for by the generally friendly staff.  So overall, it was an okay but unimpressive experience.

I imagine Pho Metro will remain a go-to spot for pho in this area because the neighbourhood is sorely missing quality pho."}
{"text":"Pho Metro exists in a non-descript plaza on the corner of Warden and Lawrence. Been here twice in 4 days because it was so good!! I'm a first timer in Vietnamese food. I LOVE thai and this menu had the usual pad thai. First time I went, I ordered a small pho (very filling) and my dining partner got their vermicilli dish with beef. Both were good!

Second trip included another two phos (excellent on a colder day) and pad thai. OMG! pad thai was delicious! I think this is a regular spot for this upcoming Canadian winter. 

The prices were cheap but I don't have anything to compare it to.. so everything pretty much was under $10! 

My only qualm is that there is a draft from the doors, so sit as far away as possible and you'll be good! :)"}
{"text":"Great little place for decent and affordable viet food. 

Inside the plaza at Kennedy and bur oak. Great appetizers (e.g. spring rolls, rice paper rolls etc) need noodle soup (S $7.25, M $8.35, L $9.25), egg noodle soup, rice dishes, vermicelli, fried rice, pad Thai, smoothies etc.

Quality of dishes are not disappointing or average at all. One of the most common avocado smoothie is done just right too. Soup broth is flavorful, texture of noodles are nice. The satay broth is more spicy than most other Vietnamese restaurants so beware.

Clean simple place inside with booths and tables. Service is quite speedy. You mark your own choices on a piece of paper.

They accept, credit and debit but not American Express. They also accept Vicinity points cards too for each dollar you spend. 

Overall nice place to eat at especially if you live in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I found Pho Metro by accident and I love it. Its a family business and Mom is busy cooking her own recipes. They must make the best broth in the city, NO MSG and NO PACKAGES...its just moms broth and its great. I tried the spring rolls for the first time  today and they are wonderful. I have to try some more things off the menu. Its a 30 minute drive from my house and worth it."}
{"text":"I've been here so many times - my \"go to\" restaurant for Pho!

Food: Their food is always consistent which is important to me knowing that I know what to expect when my food comes. I always get the bun bo hue - it's honestly the best I've ever had and it's the perfect amount of spiciness for me.

Drink: I love their avocado milkshake because they're not cheap on the avocado - it is a little on the sweet side though.

Atmosphere: Spacious area with a TV about the kitchen window.

Service: Even though some of them may not speak English well, they're still accommodating. 

Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"First time here. Homey authentic Viet restaurant that's around Kennedy and 16. Ordered special noodles and raw beef noodle Ph tái. I like the taste of the broth, importantly it was really hot when it comes out. Beef was ordered rare but when it come out it's kind of cooked mainly they pour hot soup on top of the beef and noodles instead of adding beef after soup. The bánh ph (rice noodles) are just simply the dried ones you eat at a normal pho place except a bit softer in texture. 

Prices are ranging $7-15/pp. Normal prices as other viet restaurants. I would come back for some pho for a quick fix around this area and didn't want to travel too far on a stay in- hoodie and sweat pants kind of evening."}

Markham, ON

Date visited : Thurs April 12, 2018

My wife was craving a hot bowl of beef Pho, and we happen to be in the area after I had finished my last delivery for my Skip the Dishes shift.

Service : 3/5
Service was relatively efficient, since it is an asian resto, friendliness of staff at time of our visit was mediocre.  Since the time of our visit was around 4pm there were not that many people in the dining area.

Food : 3/5
Just like to note that we are not experts on Pho by any means.  On this visit, we ordered the medium sized beef brisket Pho (approx $10.00) for my wife, and I opted for the bowl of wonton noodle soup (approx $7.50).  Both broths were good, tho the broth for the wonton soup was a bit salty in my opinion.  For me, I found the wontons to be rather on the small side (mainly filled with pork, no shrimp), compensated by you receive like 8-9 of said wontons.  I'm not really sure what the true texture of brisket beef is like, since we normally avoid beef (due to having to manage gout).  The texture of the beef reminded me of sliced deli roast beef, from my days before I became burdened with Gout.  For the price paid, it felt that the portion size was a it small for the noodle portion of the wonton noodle soup.  I like my noodles!!  Lol what can I say.  Hence why we enjoy our visits to Origination Noodle House, Silver Star branch, (unlimited noodles).  Seems for the price paid on the beef brisket Pho was a good value.  My wife had almost a difficult time finishing her bowl of Pho, she polished off the noodles and brisket and I helped polish off most of the Pho broth.

Beverages : 2/5
Ugh, the chinese tea we received, wasn't hot at all, along with being on the bitter side.  We are being more careful nowadays when we request water at restos, since we don't know most of the time of the water quality.  We are uncertain if restos are offering filtered water or straight tap water, unless it is posted.  So, when we do remember, we try to bring water from home.  We purchase Ice River water for our drinking water, we limit consumption of water from our tap even when filtered through a reverse osmosis system and then filter via a Brita.  Since our water at home is softened by a sodium based softener system, we noticed a difference in taste in the water along with noticing an affect on my Blood Pressure.  So if any of you foodies are worried about your Blood Pressure rising (you are on a controlled salt in-take) and can't figure out why? If you have a sodium based water softener in your residence, that may likely be the culprit.  It was for us at least.  I also noticed even with the double filtered water..I ended up drinking more..and I am limited to 2 L max liquid a day from my cardiologist..to avoid another case of edema in my legs.

Apologies for the tangent on the water, but I feel that it is of importance to note.  Hate to say, but at times when we are uncertain of the free water offering, we'll opt for a canned beverage instead.

Other thoughts : 
For those foodies out there that have a Vicinity.ca membership, it is accepted at this Pho Metro location.  Tho, I don't think we'll make a special trip to this Pho Metro, just for the Vicinity points.  Sure, if we happen to be nearby.  Just wish the Vicinity points were a joint pool of points instead of each resto having to collect/earn separately.  This location seems priced less than its' sibling location near Warden and Lawrence.

Repeat visits :
Would we make a repeat visit?  Yes, if we happen to be in the area.  Since we reside on the more north eastern area of Scarborough, likely not to make a specific trip just for a bowl of Pho at this Pho Metro

Debit, Credit & Cash"}
{"text":"My go to place for Vietnamese food! I've come here a few times with my family and the food has been consistently good. We usually get pho and vermicelli with noodles. Lots of toppings, tastes fresh and not too salty. It is not the best pho I have ever had but it is really really good and this place is close to home and never disappoints."}
{"text":"My mom, sister, and I came here after wedding dress shopping on a Thursday evening. When we arrived every table was full, so we figured this place must be good! A table was just finishing up so we only had to wait a few minutes to be seated. We frequently go out for Pho together, but hadn't tried Pho Metro yet. They both ordered their Pho dishes which usually I would have, but wasn't in the mood for. Instead I went with the Tofu and Vegetable Pad Thai. I hadn't had Pad Thai in awhile, and I am so glad I did because it was delicious! Their chili garlic sauce was one of the best ones I've had at an Asian restaurant. I loved it so much I used the entire amount that was at our table. Their vegetarian menu consists of 7 dishes. As usual with these places, you order on a sheet of paper food comes quick, there's always people coming and going, and service was good. Can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"The place was very clean when I visited. The pho was good- average quality. Ordered the spring rolls, but they were so tiny that I'd probably skip out on ordering it next time. Food took a little long to come, and they weren't even that busy."}
{"text":"Came here based on reviews off Yelp, and was hoping for a positive experience. Not sure whether it was a bad day, but the owner/supervisor seemed very impersonal and all about business. Seemed more occupied with more \"familiar customers/friends\" that came in after than actually providing service to newer customers. Service was quick, food was alright. I ordered off the lunch menu of their Pho house special which was decently made. The combo also came with a spring roll and pop.

To be honest, if it wasn't for the bad interaction with the host, I probably would have given a better rating, and also have come back again as a repeat customer. Unfortunately, I won't be. I've been to many Vietnamese Pho restaurants, and almost all of them are the same. The only difference when it comes down to it is the personal service and interaction the owner/host provide as soon as you enter the door. Probably something to think about for future customers that enter into your establishment."}
{"text":"I'm an avid pho lover and I get pho cravings on a weekly basis. This has been my favorite pho place since I moved to Markham. I am so excited I found a Pho 88 alternative. Great soup base, legit thin viet noodles and appropriate portions. I usually order their raw beef with tripe soup noodle. The raw beef was bright red (so I know it's fresh) and perfectly lean. The guys working there was also very accommodating. Excellent viet iced office as well :)"}
{"text":"Weird experience. Manager had to tell staff to seat us instead of doing other tasks. Clearly well-used menus show wine and beer, but they don't actually have it. They don't even have a liquor license. Spring rolls were served without a dipping sauce, and when asked, they don't have the traditional sauce you would have with them. Pho was good, but did not come with sprouts or basil. Staff (male) generally ignored us, but they were happy to chat up a single female customer about their social lives.  
Since staff would come nowhere near us, we ate our pho without sprouts. Then sat amongst all of our dirty dishes waiting for the bill. Or someone to ask if we wanted anything else. Didn't happen. So we went up to pay. Asked the manager about the sprouts and basil. He told us he'd give us double next time. Wasn't sure if he was serious or a smart-ass. Bad either way. 
Disorganized, poor service. I won't be back. And I hope the place goes out of business."}
{"text":"All pho restaurants should be modeled after this place. It's fracking clean, well run, quick service and the food is great. The owner is very personable and makes sure everything is to your satisfaction.

It's like seeing the first rays of sun at dawn, a messianic sign that everything in the world will be okay and eating here makes life a little more bearable."}
{"text":"Pho Metro is my go-to Vietnamese restaurant when I'm craving for Viet food (or when I'm hungover, haha!) that has quick service and is close to home.  The restaurant is usually pretty busy during dinner time and on weekends but their service is generally pretty fast.  I usually order the bun rieu (replace the thin noodles with the thicker rice noodle) and it never disappoints. Flavourful broth with a generous amount of toppings.  I've also tried the pho, bun bo hue, and vermicelli noodles with chicken and spring rolls - all of them are delicious as well!"}
{"text":"Amazing com bo nuong and pho tai... I always get those and have never been disappointed. Atmosphere is not bad and bubble tea is good if you are looking for a refreshing drink."}
{"text":"Have to give Pho Metro a 5 star. 

They are the best in this area and the prices are competitive.  The soup base is superb and the sprouts & Thai Basel comes fresh in a large portion.  

The defining moment is when you are not happy and talk to the owners.  That's when you know they care about your patronage.  This really elevates Metro to the 5 star ranks."}
{"text":"I've been to all Vietnamese restaurants in Scarborough and by far Phoa Metro stands above everyone else.  Below are my top 6 Vietnamese restaurants in Scarborough;

4. Phoa 88 located on Bamburgh circle
5. Phoa Hoa located on Sheppard avenue
6.  Phoa Dau Bu located on Markham road"}
{"text":"Arrived early on a weekday at 5:30pm but it started to fill up even at that time. Portions are big, prices are good. There's even a vegetarian section on the menu. Didn't have to wait long for the food and the staff are friendly enough. You go up to the counter to pay."}
{"text":"We had a great experience at pho metro. The food was delicious, well-favored, and came very quickly. The server was really helpful and made some great recommendations as well. We got the fried spring rolls, pho with beef brisket & beef balls, pho with tripe & beef (P10), & the grilled chicken pho. The chicken itself was well seasoned as well. If you bring cash, you get 10 percent off! Great meal overall :)"}
{"text":"Love this place. When you go to any restaurant, you should always order their simplest dish and see if they can do it right, and Pho Metro never fails to make a mean bowl of pho! I come here at least twice a month. The quality is consistent and the food comes quickly. The staff are also very attentive."}
{"text":"This is the best Pho option in this neck of the woods. It gets very busy at times, but service is quick so the wait is never long.

Stick with the Vietnamese options. The dishes we had were fresh and came out quickly, but not so quickly that we needed to be concerned.

Lunch special includes a select main dish, spring roll and smoothie, for $11. The jackfruit smoothie is delicious!

Lost one star for the over crowding and the noise. With the amount of people at lunch, you can't linger and are a tad rushed. Otherwise awesome!!"}
{"text":"Ordered H4, was pretty good but didn't get the purple cabbage as advertised in menu. The pho was a little watery. We ordered a shake at the beginning of our meal. We sat and watched other people get their shakes before us. Finished our food and asked about the shake and were kept waiting five minutes. So overall I'm giving a pretty low rating."}
{"text":"I come here all the time and always get excellent service and food. It's the next best thing to home cooked Vietnamese food that I've found!

I like that they have a wide range to choose from and that they have lunch combos that include a drink and spring roll."}
{"text":"First I have to say that what's really great about this place is the service. When the owner's in, he takes his time to talk to the customers and it creates a great atmosphere. Good customer service.

Regarding prices, for the portion sizes definitely worth it. I've ordered the pho on multiple occasions and I never get sick of it, it's good especially on a cold day. Every pho comes with beansprouts, if you want them cooked tell them before hand. If there's one other person you're eating with, chances are you will share the same plate of beansprouts.  However, you could always ask for more. I've also seen one person ask for a lemon slice but they didn't have any so they got a slice of lime.

I love the spring rolls, something about it with the sauce just makes it so good. The price for spring rolls is a little pricey so I would order it with the vermicelli house special  or a combo lunch meal. (Side note: the vermicelli is such a huge portion and delicious)

It's been a great experience and it's one of the better pho places in Markham. I will be back and continue to try more dishes!"}
{"text":"When my husband and I crave Vietnamese food, we come here. The food is very delicious and very fair priced. The staff are nice and there is ample parking. I've tried most of their dishes and have never been disappointed. I like the location, but I think they need a bigger space. This is more of a compliment than a criticism really because they're obviously doing something right to keep people coming back for more. It is usually packed and waiting in line can be cumbersome because there is no great place to stand. But generally, you don't have to wait long for a table. Their pho is so delicious. I personally like their soups with egg noodle instead of rice noodle. So good. I wish they added cilantro to their soups though, but no biggie. Apparently, some people have the gene that like cilantro and some who really don't, so maybe that's a good business decision lol...OK, I digress....but seriously, love this place!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on a Saturday, and it was SO GOOD. This place has a fantastic food, no wonder there's a line up out the door! The servers are friendly and responsive, and the food comes faaaast.

The portions are large, the broths are clear and flavourful without being overly salty and I didn't feel like it was laden with MSG. The spring rolls were delicious, but cut into halves instead of thirds, making each piece quite large and harder to share. The Bo Kho (Beef Stew) was so rich, with a hint of spiciness that made it mouth watering. Their Banh Hoi varieties were great as well - essentially you can't really go wrong with their menu. And the options are almost endless!

Service is great and prices are affordable. No wonder this place is a favourite in many books! I'll definitely be back again, even though it's not convenient for me to travel to - certainly worth it! 

Parent alert: there are change pads in both the women's AND the men's washroom. Seriously, that is so awesome."}
{"text":"This place has risen to the top of my list of best pho places to go in the tdot. This family run joint keeps the place clean, food is always fresh, especially bean sprout, basil, etc, and consistent, soup base is amazing...plus they are super friendly...but most importantly their pho is amazing!

I HIGHLY recommend H4 on the menu...BUN BO HUE!!!!..to die for!..I pretty much order the same thing ever since the first time I tried it at this place....which makes this review kinda useless...but I'll just keep on ranting on how good it is!!..it use to be a lot spicier in the past which I prefer more..probably bc they're trying to cater to those ppl that can't handle the spicyness..but that doesn't stop me from ordering it!...its just THAT good!..also, they stopped putting blood jelly for the same reason, but if you're into that kinda stuff like I am, ask them for it and they'll be more than happy to give u that as a side for u to dump into that big bowl of deliciousness...

Deep fried spring rolls are pretty solid as well! Finally tried their avocado shakes that everyone was talking about, it was pretty good as well!

Going back to Boston in few days. I'm glad that I satisfied my craving for that Bun Bo Hue goodness. Hopefully that taste will last me until the next I come back!

Pho Metro and BUN BO HUE for the WIN!"}
{"text":"Came here for pho a couple weeks ago on a gloomy Friday. It was pretty full inside but still a couple tables available. From outside it looks pretty sketchy but i find that most of these places do. They gave a pot of herbal tea which was perfect for the weather. We had a beer and ordered some chicken wings and pho. We had to cancel the chicken wings because the pho came out first and it was going to be too much. I ordered the beef satay but asked for it well done. It was flavored very well and i only needed to add a bit of hot sauce. They gave plenty limes and bean sprouts to put inside. I don't always end up finishing my pho but this was too good not to. All my beef was cooked very well which i always am concerned about. It was pretty cheap but they charge for debit use for certain amounts so bring cash! I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"This is the best Vietnamese restaurant I have tried in Scarborough so far! It was packed even on a late Sunday night and we had to wait for about 20-30 minutes before we got seated. But it was worth the wait. I ordered their house mung / vermicelli special so I could have a little bit of everything and it was amazing. They were quite generous on the meat, which was really flavorful. It you pay by cash, you get 10% off. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"It's a really good uptown pho spot, almost as good as Kim po at steels and Kennedy. 
Need to use less msg, but other then that really good pho. Broth is more clear then dark, noodles are nice. Server is super nice and will get any thin you ask for with out attidude (chilli oil) 
Will be coming back here for sure.
After I got my table there was a bit of a line so it does get busy"}
{"text":"5 star for the service!
The noodles were good. Did not taste MSG. Portion was pretty gensrous. Soup  was tasty.
So happy to find this new spot.
Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"This place was a staple for me when I lived in the borough. Pho with all types of beef (P1) doused in sriracha and hoisin is my order, with my fresh rolls on the side. It's the perfect place to grab food with friends but they also have take out available. They are packed pretty quickly but people don't linger so the most you'll have to wait if you're a larger group is 20-30 minutes. The noodles are made in house and the broth is so flavourful and not overly salty.
If you're in the hood, this is definitely an excellent joint to stop in for some Viet food."}
{"text":"I don't remember the last time I had to wait for a table at a pho place, but that's what happened here on a Friday night. Heard good things about this place after being let down by a couple of pho places in the Markham area, so seeing this place packed was a good sign. 

Was not disappointed. Got the raw beef with beef balls. Kitchen is run by Viet staff. When it comes to pho, broth is important. Broth was beefy and not too salty; could taste it wasn't full of MSG. Noodles were plentiful and nicely cooked. 

4/5"}
{"text":"To be fair, I usually frequent the sister and original location at Warden and Lawrence. 

This is the best pho in Markham, however the food is not as good as its sister's. My usual order from the other location is the grilled chicken pho and upon my order here, I found the chicken to be over cooked (a problem I've never had at the other) and then both also was not as flavourful. 

Unfortunately, my order was a takeout and upon my arrival at home I found almost all the basil to be wilted, browned and even slimy and having an odour on some leaves. I love my basil in my pho and I often ask for extra, which they generously provide me with and I appreciate. Not having any basil may have negatively biased my review. 

The restaurant, however is much larger and nicer and the parking lot is a lot more manageable. 

The staff are just as nice as at the other location, which I always appreciate. 

Overall, I will probably give this place another shot as it is significantly closer to me than the Scarborough one. I'll update my review when I do."}
{"text":"My favourite pho in all of Toronto, including the GTA. 

The owner and all the staff are very personable, service is quick although there can be long wait during peak dinner hours (but that's the sign of a great restaurant). 

The restaurant itself is extremely clean though it is not very fancy and some of the seating is quite close together. 

The green tea is freshly brewed, their fried spring rolls are always a hit however if you take them home they will lose their crispness. 

My go to is the grilled chicken pho (sometimes I'll add extra rare beef) or their rare beef. I usually stick to a medium. 

Portions and prices are extremely reasonable and on par with most other pho restaurants (maybe a few cents more but again the quality is great). 

It's worth the 30 minute drive over from North Markham."}
{"text":"First time here and not that impressed. The taste of the pho broth is decent however the portions are fairly small. I got a medium sized rare beef and tripe pho and the amount of noodles is what I would get in a small elsewhere and there were only four or five slices of beef. For what you are paying you can get way better at pho 88 or pho Vietnam. There are limited Vietnamese restaurants in north Markham but I would seriously drive just a bit further to get more bang for my buck."}
{"text":"The best pho/vietnamness restaurant in GTA, fresh ingredients and soup base are always ON POINT. Must try!"}
{"text":"It was ok pho not the best broth at all! The spring rolls were skinny verses traditional viet rolls --didn't taste that great either."}
{"text":"Can't say I was blown away by the food - it was good! I'd come back for it! Nothing crazy though.
The four stars was definitely for the service. Never caught his name, but my friend and I came here for lunch, and honestly? The coolest worker. Insanely funny and friendly. My friend wouldn't stop trying to convince me to make this our \"regular joint\". Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Standard pho in a convenient location. Glad that I was able to find a table even during peak lunch hour. The pho itself was good; standard price for expected quantity. I found the soup base mildly salty versus actually flavourful. However, the noodles were definitely fresh tasting and had a good texture. I was actually quite impressed with the meat to noodle ratio, as I am often used to ordering a large sized pho only to get more noodles and nothing else. But luckily, I was pleasantly surprised to find a fair amount of meat! The spring rolls were filled with Pork, shrimp, vermicelli and lettuce, and were accompanied by a light hoisin and peanut sauce. Overall, pretty decent pho location for a quick pho fix!"}
{"text":"Food quality and portions are good.  I found the rare beef noodles ($8.45 medium size) was not oily,  the beef is pretty lean.   The spring rolls ($9 for 4) were delicious, not greasy.   

The only downside is I find that pho metro is a bit pricier than other pho plazas.   If I had other alternative choices for pho, I'd go to somewhere that's less expensive."}
{"text":"Delicious pho, chicken on vermicelli dinners and spring rolls. Prices are a little higher then other places I've been too but this restaurant is nicer inside. The only reason I didn't give this place a 5 star is the staff speaks minimal English, and doesn't show you the break down of the bill when you pay. 

My favourite pho is the satay beef and satay chicken with peanut dipping sauce. I often order these for take out. The pho comes completely separated so you are able to reheat the broth before putting the raw beef in when you get home."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place for their bun mainly, but my biggest beef was that their spring rolls weren't your traditional Vietnamese ones with the yellow wrapping and extra crsipy. The spring rolls served with the bun here were the Chinese type...and weren't too stuffed. Maybe even frozen? Not sure if they just ran out he day we went, but it was a little disappointing to be honest. 

The pho was okay, nothing really too memorable but a good place to get your pho fix if in the area."}
{"text":"What we loved about this place was the better beef that came in the pho.  There were good chunks of beef and a healthy amount of meat as well.  I would say more than average.  Broth was also good.  4 stars instead of 5 because my cousins who are bigger eaters felt there wasn't enough noodles in the large pho compared to their usual pho places.  They were still a bit hungry, even with a side of spring rolls!  Crispy spring rolls were good, but nothing special."}
{"text":"A definite go to!! 
I was very surprised with the excellent customer service !!!food was delicious 
Must have grilled chicken and fried rice with the rare beef soup!!!!

Even tho the place was a bit too tight it was worth it. I also had to changed my mind about my order a few times, the server was still very patient and polite. This is what I call quality service at it finest!!!

Thank you !!! Will be back!"}
{"text":"best pho place ive been to.this is my go to place.brough lots of people here and all liked it"}
{"text":"I've been going here for years! I always enjoyed the food growing up! It's probably one of my go-to places for Pho!"}
{"text":"Foods: Not entirely memorable as it is mostly bland in taste and not wowing in wow factor. Two of us ordered the Pho, and though it was a dark broth colour, it passed as \"alright\" pho. The \"bun cha gio\" was alright too. I still find the best to be from Pho Vietnam."}
{"text":"Horrible service and seems like the owners change from the last time I went... pho broth is bland with minimal aroma. Sorry will not return"}
{"text":"If you are craving for quality,reasonably-priced vietname noodle soup around Scarborough area- this is the place to be!!  I'm just sorry I didn't know this sooner. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Vietnamese restaurant in Scarborough. The food is always good and never full of MSG. The broth are to die for!!"}
{"text":"This fucking place made me disappointed at the first time I tried. When I passed through the kitchen, I saw it really dirty. How come you guys open the restaurant like that? Moreover, the food was so slow. I did not understand why I came before the guy sitting next to my table, but he had the food first. I am Vietnamese and he is not. Are you racist? Is that the reason why I was not treated well. I did not recommend you guys the food here and I will never come back."}
{"text":"Came by here for take out as i was recommended by friends on how great of a pho place this was. I wasnt disappointed! 

The portion size was bigger than other places ive been to for take out. Also the broth was probably one of the best ive had in the area. Definitely will be back again."}
{"text":"Great place and service! A bit pricy compare to other pho places but overall busy and good food"}
{"text":"The broth here is super fresh and consistent on a daily basis. The service is quick and easy and better than most pho places. Parking is plenty in front and this is a great Pho place to cure that crazy hangover I usually have on Sundays.  The prices are decent and the fresh rolls are fresh.  Spring rolls are delicious and I recommend the Pho Dac Biet as their noodle to meat ratio is almost always perfect. 

Not too much noodles and not too much meat...juuust right and just enough to get your moneys worth without being overly stuffed."}
{"text":"3.5

Pho broth was OK, not that flavourful in my opinion. I think they are not that consistent with portion and the amount of toppings in my pho. Range from small to good portion size or lots of meat to little meat in my pho.

Also tried a side of small spring rolls. $2.50 for a spring roll. Good but kinda expensive. 

Bun Rieu was really good. Flavour of the broth was nice and generous amount of toppings. The crab meatballs had a more fishy taste that I didn't really mind. 

Grilled chicken and egg. Came with rice and this was amazing. Grilled meat so flavourful and tender! 

Service is average. The place is spacious with many tables. Good prices for the mains if you're looking for a quick eat. Good pho place in Markham!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a place with grilled pork with spring rolls and vermicelli on the way home from uptown, and found this place through Yelp. This place did not disappoint! The grilled pork is juicy and flavourful, and the spring rolls were just as tasty! The portions were big, and the meat was plentiful. I will be back here anytime I am in the area. As a lover of viet food, I can't believe I didn't find this place earlier!"}
{"text":"Amazing pho, amazing rolls, amazing everything. I love coming to Pho Metro. You get an amazing meal that tastes delicious for a cheap price. You can't go wrong with anything. My friend and I got an extra large pho to share for around $10, and 2 sets of rolls which are $5 each (which comes in 2s). We were so full at the end of just the pho itself. I do get that most of it is noodles and soup and not so much beef but for $5 per person you can't go wrong with something so delicious. The fresh rolls are probably my favourite. We got the beef rolls. The beef inside is so flavourful and with the addition of their peanut sauce it has the perfect amount of sweet and savoury. The deep fried spring rolls were good but probably not worth $2.5 per spring roll but try it if you get it with the vermicelli!"}
{"text":"I was working around the area so I decided to have pho on this cold windy day. I am a HUGE fan of Bun bo hue and I haven't pho since I've discovered Bun bo hue. 

With that being said, my overall experience with this restaurant was just meh.

Came in and the guy at the counter was busy but greeted me right away. It was just me and so I sat at a clean table. I knew what I wanted and it was a self order sheet so I filled it out. Needless to say that, for the next 5 minutes, no one really noticed that I filled out my order. 
The guy at the counter was running around cleaning up and getting people's bills. While other new coming customers sat at dirty tables (which looked like it was annoying him). 

I got my bun bo hue and there wasn't really any meat, no tripe and no pigs blood. There was a lot of lemon grass and that's all I could taste in my mouth (the graininess of it). For $9.50, it wasn't worth it as most of the bowl was soup and noodles. 

Another thing that had me annoyed was the guy at the counter. He was so angry at people and was really sarcastic and negative. If you want customers to come back , you need to present an atmosphere where people enjoy their dining experience. We don't want to see you throwing stuff, getting mad at guests (even if they are stupid enough to sit at dirty tables when there are clean tables), just be happy. I would've taken my time eating and stayed longer and maybe even ordered a drink. But because I felt uncomfortable I wanted to finish eating right away and leave."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. This is my go-to place for Vietnamese food in Scarborough. The price is great for its value. You can get a large bowl for pho for under $9. The broth gets you hooked on because it's just so fresh and delicious! 

The customer service here is also amazing. Makes you always want to come again and again. I totally recommend coming here!!"}
{"text":"I was in the mood to try a new Vietnamese restaurant that I haven't been to before.  We were excited after reading all the high rating reviews for this restaurant so I convinced my husband to go.  We were very impressed that the restaurant was owned and operated by Vietnamese people but were disappointed in the food from its authenticity.  I do give it .5+ star for the staff friendliness. 

I ordered bun bo hue and while it tasted better than most in Markham but doesn't cut it for flavour and authenticity compared to others in west Toronto or downtown.  My husband ordered rice dish with chicken (flavourful), but his BBQ beef was quite bland.  The straw that broke the camel's back was we ordered 3 additional take out dishes for my family while we were still eating our food and yet after we finished eating we didn't get the food until 35 minutes later which we found was unacceptable.  For that reason we won't be visiting again."}
{"text":"CUSTOMER SERVICE: The service was great! Though our waiter can't fully understand English, he tried his best to answer our questions which I highly respect

FOOD: Me and my sisters ordered Two Pho with a choice of beef and brisket, and Bun Rieu. All orders were very delicious! The broth was very simple but with flavor at the same time. The meat was nicely cooked and very tender and flavorful. 

I would highly recommend coming to this place! If I come back to this area, which I probably will, I would love to come back."}
{"text":"Came to this location on a Tuesday afternoon for lunch. Surprised to see they opened a connecting \"Banh Mi Metro\" beside Pho Metro. This location is far superior in taste, quality and freshness than the Bur Oak location. 

Food - 5/5
I often can't decide whether to order the pho noodle soup or the vermicelli dry noodle when eating at a Viet restaurant. This time I felt so hungry, I actually ordered both! Pho Metro has the best vermicelli meals in my opinion. I ordered the house special vermicelli which usually comes with shimp paste on sugar cane, but i think they were out, so they gave us a sauteed shrimp skewer instead. The grilled beef and pork were amazing. It was seasoned perfectly and you can taste the charred BBQ flavour. The spring roll was average and salad was fresh. We also ordered the house special beef pho. The noodles had good texture and the sliced beef, tendon, tripe and flank were all good. Broth was clear and flavourful. Even the plate of bean sprouts seemed fresher and cleaner than most places.

Service - 4/5
Prompt service. Needed extra fish sauce, got it right away. They had enough staff working during the busy lunch hour. 

Value - 4.5/5
The best spot for vermicelli. They really load up on the meat portions. The quality, freshness, and taste are the areas where Pho Metro beats out its competitors. Sure, you can find cheaper Vietnamese restaurants, but not very many leave you as satisfied as Pho Metro. I live in the Markham area and drove all the way to this location because I know I can always count on them for good authentic Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Pho is a fairly standard dish to me. My issue with Pho Metro is the price. Pho Special Large is $8.45. Small and medium are $6.45 and $7.45 respectively. I'm used to paying $1 less on all sizes. That's a difference of almost 15%. I know I sound stingy but if I eat something several times a month, it adds up. Especially if you add tax and tip. The other issue is portion. For a large, it didn't feel like a large. It was mostly soup. I also find the amount of beef to be less than other restaurant's large.

We ordered a spicy noodle as well (no choice of size). I was surprised that the spicy noodle had more meat than the large. 

Taste wise both were good but comparable to the other million pho places. So because of the higher price and somewhat disappointing portion, I don't think I'll come back unless I'm in the area and really need pho."}
{"text":"For durham it's the only authentic Vietnamese joint in the region I know about. The problem is the pho isn't anyway near the quality of pho tien Thanh or pho linh.  This is just average at best.  However, their Bun bo hue is good.  It's really the only thing I order.  Spring rolls are good too. One thing that pisses me off at this restaurant is that they refuse to bring you the bill. They ask you to go up and pay the bill. That's fine and dandy but what if you need to review the bill among the group to calculate the bill?

Annoying. I hate coming here but like I said it's the only one that got Vietnamese workers making the food even though the quality isn't as good as the other two places I mentioned."}
{"text":"Came here couple weeks ago and thought my experience was mediocre. I came on a Tuesday night, so I wasn't expecting a lot of customers. Lo and behold it was quite busy, possibly because it's still new. I ordered a L beef brisket Pho, my typical order. The size was ok, definitely better than other places in terms of price to portion. The brisket was tender and fatty, just the way I like it. They only use dry noodles, which is a +1 in my book because Pho should not be the thick ho fun noodles imo. The soup base was rather bland, but not entirely bad. I still haven't found a replacement Pho restaurant that can compare to some of the ones in downtown and the West end.

Although the food wasn't anything spectacular, the service was! All the staff were friendly and extremely well mannered - not surprised because they're Asian.

I will be visiting this place more to try their other items. For now, 3 stars is sufficient."}
{"text":"So having gone to the Pho Metro in Scarborough on Lawrence East, I was expecting that this location would be comparable but it didn't fair up to the same standards. Price was about $2 more per size (thinking probably due to being in Markham) and the portions were much less. My sister ordered the dry vermicelli with grilled chicken (bun) and it tasted overly salty. The portion was also small for the price of $10. The ambience was decent and the service was mediocore. I'll stick to Pho Metro in Scarborough instead."}
{"text":"Hands down my favourite pho place - I've literally lost count of how many times I've been here over the past few months. 

The staff are always friendly and I am usually seated very quickly if the place is not busy. Every bowl of pho I've gotten is filled with plenty of meat - they don't skimp out unlike other places! Beef is alwsys tender and soup base is very flavourful! 

Bonus, they have wifi here too!"}
{"text":"Came here and was pleasantly surprised. Probably one of the best pho places in the area. Their fried spring rolls were really good and crispy. The grilled chicken noodle soup is delicious! A new fave!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and got the bun bo hue, iced Viet coffee and bf got the regular pho. The flavour of the bun no hue was decent, it was a bit on the bland side but portions was huge. The regular pho was very good, broth was fresh and noodles were great. Iced Viet coffee was not too sweet. Overall very decent pho, I think I would try the regular pho next time. There was quite a lot of people at lunch time."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today.  I'm not really a pho expert but decided to come because of the good reviews.  

I ordered a med special pho.  The size was decent and I thought that it was good.  Had enough toppings and soup base was ok.  My husband ordered the bun bo hue.  It looked nice and flavour was ok.  The side plate of basil, beansprouts, cabbage and limes were really fresh but I missed the fresh chilli.

Not as outstanding as I thought it would be, based on the other Yelp reviews.  The best pho that I have ever had was in Paris, France.  The soup base was amazing there.  The service is excellent, if you speak English or Vietnamese (plus 1/2 * ) If you only speak Cantonese or Mandarin(like the table next to us), and don't know much English, then you're stuffed.  They couldn't write their own order down properly or tell the staff what they wanted.  

I wouldn't really come back in a hurry but if I was in the area again and wanted some pho, I would return."}
{"text":"Being new to the area, we decided to scope a new Pho place. Yelp is almost always reliable when wanting to try a new restaurant. The first one that came up was Pho Metro, it was only a 10 min drive from where we live. As soon as we got there, there was a lineup almost outside the door. I've never been to Pho restaurant where you have to line up, usually you are seated right away. The lineup was long but the wait time was less than 5-10 mins. The family that ran the restaurant were very efficient..the service was above average. My boyfriend and I ordered the deep fried spring rolls and avocado shake which were both recommended by several reviews and it was truly the best I've ever had at a viet restaurant. Our pho noodle soup with beef and beef balls had probably one of the best broths I've tasted. It was not oily or think and had a nice flavour to it. Another great thing is that the portions were pretty generous than most pho places that give you the bare minimum of meat. The price was pretty average, a small bowl was about $5-6.  I'm giving it one less star due to the cleanliness of the restaurant. Overall, definitely coming back and I love going to pho restaurants that are owned by true viet people because you know that the food will be more authentic."}
{"text":"I have been craving pho for a while and this place definitely satisfied me. It's close to home, clean, quick, tasty, and cheap.

I went in around 2 and there were only a couple tables eating, but I can see this place being really busy during the school year since it's right next to a high school. 

The service was quick, you write down which order # you wanted on a piece of paper already set up at the table. Before I could get even get through a scroll session on instagram my food had arrived. Speedy. 

I ordered one of their lunch combos, any small beef noodle soup, a spring roll and a pop for $10.75 including tax. A small was enough for me personally there was a lot of stuff in that bowl. Everything was tasty and to my liking, not full of msg which is so refreshing. The noodles were still steaming as I was eating it, I kinda burnt my tongue but sacrifices must be made for good food. 

The decor is pretty modern compared to other Vietnamese restaurants.
This is my go to pho plaza in the area for sure. 

Also you collect vicinity points here!"}
{"text":"Cute spot! Would have walked right by it if it weren't for yelp telling me to try it out. Quick service, you order on a sheet and pay at the counter when you are done. 
Food smells and tastes amazing. The meat was great and not too chewy. I got the bein rein I think it was called with crab paste. The boyfriend got the P1 special. I liked mine more then he liked his. We also split the mango salad which was amazing with a sweet sauce and heaps of mango and apple.
The restaurant was busy even though it was 2:30 on a Sunday.  We got the last free seat. Basic decorations."}
{"text":"Ordered the Bun Bo Hue. Flavorful broth and al-dente noodles, but small protein portion and the meat was also a little tough. 

Service was quick and attentive."}
{"text":"This place is awesome the food is great and the service is good. It can be busy so prepare to line up for a bit but the wait isn't long at all. The pho here is amazing. Broth is well done."}
{"text":"My new go to pho place! Their broth is clean and clear, not overly greasy like some places and the portions are just right. We also love the rice paper roll dish, most pho places I visit don't have it. We usually get the assortment of meats and it comes with the rice paper already soften on a mesh plate.  Another soup noodle dish we love is the bun bo hue it's beef and pork in this spicy broth, it only comes in one size perfect blend of tangy and spicy. They also have pretty good shake/smoothies, we love the avocado shakes (who doesn't love avocado), coconut and the Vietnamese coffee. All in all a great pho place with a variety of great dishes, defiantly a must try if u haven't!"}
{"text":"I don't live far from the area, so when I'm feeling for Pho, this is my go to place. 

The Bon Bo Hue (hope I spelled that right), is yummy. Not as spicy as I would hope, but tasty none the less.

 The spring rolls are very tasty. I also recommend their grilled chicken. It's very flavourful. 

The space is small, so when it's busy, it'll be a bit of a wait to get a seat. But it's worth it."}
{"text":"When they first opened the quality was consistent with warden and Lawrence.. now it isn't as good.
Bean sprouts were brown and green onions tasted old. Use fresh veggies dammit!
I use to consider their bowl of Pho as a cut above the rest but now they are ... superior amongst the mediocre."}
{"text":"Good food, and good service. The pho is always fresh and not oily, their crispy spring rolls are great too! I go there often and will continue to!"}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to go to Pho Metro for a quick bite yesterday. She ordered a small special beef noodle ($7.25) and I ordered the chicken pad thai ($9.25) and we shared the small fresh chicken rolls ($5).

Food was good. My friend seemed to like her pho, had no complaints. The portion seemed kind of small to me, but she didn't finish it. Then again, my friend is like 4'11. It looked like there was a decent amount of beef and other fixings in it. I liked that the pho came with a plate of fresh bean sprouts and basil. 

My chicken pad thai was a good portion. It was full of chicken and had basil leaves in it, which made it extra flavourful. My only gripe with it is that it didn't come with tofu. 

The chicken fresh rolls were good. Rolled tightly, so they didn't unravel as soon as I bit into them. It came with some sort of sweet peanut sauce, which the both of us really enjoyed. 

Service was quick and efficient. Had my water refilled quickly and food came pretty quickly after we ordered it. 

This place is more expensive than most other pho places. I can get a large pho for $7.25. Their lunch combos are $9.50+, while other restaurants in that plaza boast $5 lunch combos. It's not a smart price point considering most of their clientèle will be high school students. 

I've seen so many restaurants in that unit fail before. It will be interesting to see how long Pho Metro lasts."}
{"text":"Solid pho place. The pho and grilled meat is good. It gets a bit crowded because the place is small, and sometimes takes a bit of time finding a parking spot."}
{"text":"One of my favourite pho restaurants! I never have to wait long for a seat or my food despite it being such a busy place. The food and service is really good and they have pretty affordable lunch combos.

They're also part of the Vicinity rewards program which is a plus. I've gotten enough points for a free large plate of spring rolls and more :)"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the Bo Bun Hue. It was nice and falvourful, but no where near 'spicey'. You have to add sirracha or chilli. This pho came with some fresh basil sprigs, bean sprouts, and cabbage I believe. This is exactly what you need when you have a cold or are feeling under the weather. 
The shrimp and pork spring rolls were crispy, and paired well with the sweet dipping sauce. 
The rice paper rolls w/ shrimp, pork, vermicilli, and vegetables were fresh and had that crisp from the greens inside. Pairs well with the peanut sauce. 
This is overall a decent Vietnamese restaurant that I would come back too. 
This place is really small and cramped, but that did not bother me. :)"}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever gone to a Vietnamese restaurant as busy as this place! I arrived here at 7:30pm and as expected for dinner time, it was crowded. I put my name down on the waiting list and my partner and I waited approximately 15 minutes to be seated.

The service is very friendly and the servers are very polite. I ordered the C1 and my partner ordered P12. The pho broth was very flavorful (I'm not sure if there was msg). My grilled meat plate was delicious. Sometimes you can tell that the food is really old, but this was good.

Well come back for sure to try out other menu items."}
{"text":"Pho Metro is a small chain of Vietnamese restaurants that is Vietnamese run and owned. The Lawrence and Warden Ave location in Scarborough is the original location. I have been going on and off to this location for quite a few years and I can honestly say that's it's pretty difficult to find good authentic Vietnamese in the east end of the city. Many but not all of the Vietnamese restaurants in the east end are usually Chinese owned and run and the pho is usually MSG heavy and they don't offer a lot of variety in terms of dishes on the menu. Pho Metro is one of the exceptions.

Over the years, I have tried many of the dishes at Pho Metro and they were all quite good but I'll focus on my normal order which is a medium Pho Dac Biet ($8.45 plus tax) which is essentially the pho special that comes with raw beef, tripe, tendon and beef balls. The noodles are cooked perfectly and the broth is excellent with minimal msg. Nice strips of raw beef. The tripe, tendon and beef balls were standard.

If you are looking for a good authentic Vietnamese restaurant in the east end, I would definitely recommend Pho Metro. It's probably one of the best in the east end, if not the best.The service is standard for a Vietnamese restaurant and the restaurant is quite clean. The prices aren't cheap and a little on the high end for Scarborough but the quality is there."}
{"text":"Always great service whether it's take out or dining in. Food has improved a lot. Authentic Vietnamese food. The only draw back is dessert menu not that great. They do however have good options on bubble tea drinks"}
{"text":"No. Just no.

I met a friend here for lunch at noon in the middle of the week. I arrived first an asked for a table for two. They told me sit at table 7, that made no sense to me because table numbers are not posted on top of the tables, luckily they pointed to the table that was in front of the cash counter. I flip through the menu while waiting for my friend, a staff came by, dropped off a pot of tea with one cup and taking away the other menu. I'm pretty sure I told them I wanted a table for two people. A minute after that, she came to ask if I was ready to order, this was when I told her I was waiting for a friend. It wasn't busy at all, so I wasn't sure what the rush was about. 

My friend arrives shortly after and we order some spring rolls with our perspective bowl of pho within 5 mins of her arrival. It didn't take long for the spring rolls to arrive and I must say I was shocked. Two of them came on a plate, and they were about a centimeter thick and half the size of the oblong plate, For $5, that was totally not worth it as it was pretty much just the crispy outer layer with no filling. 

Then my extra large noodles came, broth and noodles were fine, portion felt more like a large and the beef balls were the size of dimes. What is this? Beef balls for ants? It should be at least... 2x the size. /zoolander reference. Seriously, they were some of the small beef balls I have ever seen.

Eventually,  it got more busy, with a queue out the door by 1pm, and we were feeling like we were being rushed to leave. I got the sense when they came to the table and took away our tea while I was still having noodles. Thanks for that. I would definitely not queue up for this place, probably wouldn't even come back."}
{"text":"Consistently good. I've had their pho, rice dishes, and vermicelli. All are top quality dishes so it's hard to go wrong here. Staff are friendly and are courteous and treat customers like people as opposed to some other Asian places. The only possible downside is the size of the place. Gets packed during typical peak hours so it can take a while to get a seat but otherwise this is probably one of my favourite vietnamese restaurants in toronto."}
{"text":"This is a great place to get pho!!! The broth is flavourful, the servings are plentiful, the chandeliers makes for a modern, chic ambiance, the sides (basil/bean sprouts and shredded cabbage/a generous chunk of lime) are plentiful and fresh.  Came here for the spring rolls and the pho with tripe/rare beef/flank and beef balls.  There were adequate amounts of each of each of the ingredients in the soup.  I was really impressed that the sides offered were overflowing and abundant, with no wilting leaves/pieces in sight.  The place itself looks clean and inviting.  After all these positives, what makes this place above other pho places is that it offers way better atmosphere, quality, abundance, freshness, meat than the average pho place and they sell it for about a buck or two cheaper than it's closest competitors in the area."}
{"text":"Been here quite a few times with my family and it's quickly become a go-to place for us although being a little out of the way. The food is consistently good and the price is decent, particularly because the portions are quite big. They have great lunch specials too that basically come with an entree, spring rolls and a drink. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for the last 2 years and it all started with a craving for a jack fruit shake. The delicious  list : Pho,  crispy chow mein,  vermicelli noodles,  spring rolls,  rice paper rolls,  shakes,  banh xua (crispy pancake) weekend special and the rices dishes (insert and meat entrée). You won't be disappointed with any thing on the menu."}
{"text":"Great place for comfort food, definitely preferred the vermicelli dishes over the pho. I would recommend the special combo for the rice dish. It comes with a bit of everything- grilled chicken, grilled pork, shredded pork skin veggies and on top a fried egg. The chicken and pork chop were seasoned just right. Very flavourful. The only downfall about the place is that when I came in there was a huge smell of bleach and it never went away. Not a big fan of chemicals when you have food in your mouth. There is another location in Scarborough which taste a lot better than this one. Try that one out for their pho!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy their pho :) especially the spicy noodle one XD although it's always ppl lining up(usually need to wait around 15-20mins) but I think it's worth it! 
Saw lots of ppl ordering smoothie maybe could try next time :p"}
{"text":"Food is decent, but the service from the waitresses were terrible. Not only they took wrong orders several times, they also have bad attitude while handling down the food. What a shame. I was looking forward to try this place out. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Best pho place Ive ever been to. The vegetables are always fresh - unlike many places Ive been to downtown. The service is fast and the actual restaurant is clean, and modern. 

I usually get the vermicelli with a grilled meat and spring rolls. Today, I had the grilled chicken and spring roll vermicelli. The portions are just right, and the spring rolls are ridiculously crispy (I see tons of other tables order them as a side dish). Additionally, I had the iced Vietnamese coffee with condensed milk ($3.25). Sweet, creamy, and strong enough to put hair on your chest. 

I want a Pho Metro next to my house."}
{"text":"I am Vietnamese and my mom makes homemade pho, so I'm very picky in terms of what I consider good, quality pho! Pho Metro is run by Vietnamese people so you know it's as authentic as it gets. This place just hits the spot.

Started with their Vietnamese spring rolls and they were sizzling hot when brought to our table. At the risk of burning our tongues we fought our urges to dive right into them. They were skinnier spring rolls than what you'd typically see. After cooling down, we bit into their crispy wraps and savoury pork/shrimp fillings. These are definitely a must order! Full of flavour. We should've got the large order.

I ordered the pho Dac Biet, which is the special pho. The broth was not very oily and a good clear/light brown but so flavourful. The rare beef actually came out pink, which I love! I personally am quite displeased when I order rare beef and it's already cooked to medium in the broth. Very good mix and portion of different meats. Lots of rare beef slices, which most pho stores like to cheap out on because it's more expensive than flank or tripe. The amount of noodle and it's size/texture was just right. So all very delicious and almost* as good as homemade!!! 

Also got an order of jack fruit shake to go. Normally I can't finish it while sitting, so that's why I ask for it in a to go cup. Nope, I devoured it all in one sitting. Blended right on the spot. 

Very clean and chic decor. There were a few other tables at the time we went, but we went to grab lunch at 3pm so it was an odd time. Server acknowledged a couple patrons; seems as though they have a lot of regulars. Had high chairs, small scissors for cutting food for kids - very family friendly.

Another thing I like to note is how thirsty I get after eating pho, usually as a measure of how much MSG they use. Safe to say I didn't feel the need to gulp down a bottle of water after leaving the restaurant. Left with just the lingering thoughts of how yummy my meal was! Wish I lived closer, I would definitely be a regular."}
{"text":"this is a great Vietnamese local restaurant 
the prices are regular and the service is nice ! 
the pho is average for me not exceptional but will leave you  satisfied 

I would recommend a medium size because small is very small and you will not be full I would say the pho here is about 3.5/5 the broth is decent but pretty similar compared to other competitors 

I personally like the chicken bun. it's has nice flavours of sweetness and comes in a good portion for $9.5. the chicken is absolutely scrumptious and I love it !! 4/5 
for a spring roll in the bun it is $1 more but the spring roll is crispy and fresh 

I also got the grilled beef and rice with egg and it was pretty awesome as well 4/5 decent portion and the beef was tender 

The drinks are pretty good as well I would recommend the mango smoothie first and the avocado smoothie second 

overall good pho place that will fulfill your cravings !!"}
{"text":"Just average...

On an extremely busy day the wait is around 15-20 mins for a table. This place desperately needs an expansion and more tables.
The only time when we needed service was when we asked for the bill but it took so long so we just came to the front and paid, definitely much faster.
Food is average. I tried their avocado shake based on the tips and reviews and I find it pretty good.
The rare beef tastes great and despite them being busy, they got our orders right. Service is fast. Only needed to wait 5 minutes before our food arrived."}
{"text":"Good pho. Soup is tasty and doesn't make you thirsty 30 minutes later. Portion is fair and price is just. Definitely better than the average pho in the gta."}
{"text":"We usually go to the Scarborough location but since we moved to Ajax we were delighted to see another pho metro! Pat first, the food was comparable to the Scarborough  location and the portions were just as generous. However, as time passed by (roughly the last 6 months) every time we get more and more disappointed. First they changed their portion sizes - price didn't drop though. Then the service became mediocre.....the staff aren't as friendly or attentive and the food takes longer. They changed several of the recipes....the wonton soup broth is pure wonton soup base with MSG, the spring roll,wrappers are gummy in texture, the vermicelli dishes don't even come with their own bowls of vinaigrette anymore! Instead off to the side, they have a squirt bottle of pre-made sauce that is basically sugar salt water - there is no evidence of any fish sauce in it at all! Their dishes are now laced in MSG, you can taste it and feel it after you eat. I'm guessing they adjusted the menu to accommodate the residents of the area and without much competition in terms of the same type of cuisine, no one would know the difference - BUT WE DO!!
They used to be one of our faves and go to places but not any longer. We would much rather visit the Scarborough location where the dishes stay true."}
{"text":"Quick service, great price, best pho 

I'm hooked. I could write a long drawn out review on Pho Metro but the plain truth is that it was some of the best Pho I've ever had. 

It's a small place, not extravagant by any means but we we seated quickly. It's important to me that pho at lunch is speedy because I usually go during work lunch hour with colleagues. 

I like that the menu had a lot of pictures and descriptions for all of the dishes. The pho bowls has 4 sizes, small, medium, large and extra large. I got the P10 - basically their traditional pho minus the tripe. The small was a good size and I was able to finish it all (usually I can't). The noodles though - the best part. They were rice noodles but very fine which I really liked. There was enough meat and great sauce selection.

Our servers were attentive and quick. They accept debt, visa (for a charge) and cash. The front host said I looked like Kim Kardashian, so aside from the pho obviously I will go again haha!"}
{"text":"This is a decent pho place.  The soup base tastes great.  If you compare Pho Metro to others in Markham, it does give you the value.  I ordered a large and the portion would be similar to a medium from other places.  the fried spring rolls were pitiful, there was almost no filling and extremely small and thin - again the taste was there.  In this area there isn't a lot of Pho choices but a small drive away will yield better value."}
{"text":"not bad. one of my go to pho place in my area. if coming on a weekend parking can be a hassle. during the weekdays it can be full of highschoolers since it is right across so be alarm of that. food wise is pretty decent and the price is alright. service is okay during non  busy days but its hard to get service when its super busy."}
{"text":"My search continues...

I've been looking for a great pho restaurant in Markham and today I gambled with Pho Metro. I ordered the 'Pho Special' (rice noodle with rare beef, beef balls, beef flank and beef tripe ).

Pho Special:
I wish I could say the pho was delicious but it was really average. The beef balls was actually beef ball (just 1 beef ball)  and the rare beef was medium, not rare. Most importantly, the soup base was bland. If you don't have a good soup base than what do you have?

The service was good and the staff were friendly. The ambience is ok but most importantly, the seats and the table were clean and well stocked."}
{"text":"Hooray for Markham! I'm a take out regular here. It's still not like north west toronto authentic but Pho Metro is great they have a lot of selection of Viet noodle soup probably one of the better Viet options in Markham at the moment. Not sure if it is done deliberately but compared to other restaurants I think they've toned down some of the soup base flavor. Maybe it's to appeal more so to the demographic in the area. Still very good though.

What to order- Any and All of their grilled meats on rice/vermicelli. I promise you it is like grilled meat heaven! 
I have not tasted pork chop better then Viet grilled pork chop. Seriously, give it a try. You will wonder how you ate pork chop any other way."}
{"text":"Very busy place in Scarborough in an unassuming strip mall.   Decent seating but a bit tight.

The food is good!  Decent portions and very tasty!

My vermincelli with chicken and spring roll was very good.  Lettuce was fresh and cold, noodles were done properly, chicken was not burned and spring rolls was not oily.  The pho likewise was great.

A must try place if you want decent food in a fairly \"basic\" environment."}
{"text":"Pho metro is AWESOME! I kept seeing all my yelp friends check in and I definitely thought it was the one at lawrence and I was like.. ugh! I don't want to travel so far for pho.. then I realized it was a new pho place near me! YAY!

It opened up in the plaza right beside pierre elliot trudeau school and it's right beside pixel 8! Easy and convenient. The pho is a bit pricey for markham, standing at $8~ per medium bowl but when it came out, the medium is quite big and the pho broth was pretty clear and didn't look like it had MSG poisoning. The beef was very soft and delicious while the broth was warm and inviting. Let me tell you, there's no better feeling in the world than warm pho broth/pho noodles entering a hungry belly. I also had a vietnamese pork sausage on the side, which was tasty too. ^_^ 

The place is nice, clean and service is efficient. Definitely would return more often to satisfy my pho belly, especially since it's less than 10 minutes away from home."}
{"text":"Pho is good everyday but especially on a cold winter night. Being so close to our house, we couldn't believe we hadn't checked out Pho Metro before. We had also been looking for a new pho place for a while since our old favourite unfortunately didn't do too well. Even though the prices are higher than other pho places, with Pho Metro's location and taste, I think we've found our new go-to. 

We ordered:
2 deep fried shrimp & pork rolls ($5.00) - these were pretty good but the sauce needed just a bit more flavour. 

Grilled pork chop with steamed rice ($8.99) - my parents and brother really liked it. It reminded us of a filipino dish the way the pork was marinated - it had a sweet taste to it. 

Grilled chicken, pork, & spring rolls with vermicelli and veggies ($10.50) - my mom liked the dish. Balanced with the veggies, sauce, and meat with spring rolls - & definitely a dish for the hungry. 

The special rice noodle soup with rare beef, beef balls, beef flank, & beef tripe (large - $9.25). It was really close to how our old fave pho place used to taste. Good soup base and noodles. Definitely worth a try if you're in the area and craving some pho. 

For a drink, I ordered the iced coffee with condensed milk ($3.99) - the coffee is pretty strong which I like and the condensed milk doesn't make the drink as creamy as you think it'd be. I wish it was a larger size for the price though! 

Overall, it's a solid restaurant with good food, a bit overpriced yeah, but the food, service, and nice ambience make up for it. Plus - if you live in this area, it's probably the closest yummy pho place around. 

Also - if you have a Vicinity card, they reward your meals with points for it."}
{"text":"Solid pho place - pretty busy on the weekends so you might have to wait at least 10-15 minutes during peak times. 

Atmosphere is good, not fancy but clean, & service is fast. We ordered what we usually get when we go out as a fam to eat pho:

Noodle soup with rare brisket and tripe (largest size was $10.45). Great broth and ingredients - if we didn't order so many other things, we probably could have done away with another bowl. 

House special steamed rice with grilled chicken and pork,  a sunny-side up egg, & veggies. Delicious! The portion was also bigger than we were expecting so for $11.45 it's a good deal. 

Vermicelli with grilled pork and fried spring rolls for $9.45 was good - meat was cooked nicely and the vermicelli itself was soft & chewy (in a good way...not mushy). 

We always get spring rolls to share and our classic go-to is the fried shrimp and pork rolls ($5.00). These were a bit pricier than I've seen but delicious nonetheless. We also ordered regular rice paper rolls with shrimp and pork that came with a peanut sauce ($5.00) -  a good healthier and savoury option from the sweeter and crunchier fried rolls we had. 

Definitely a recommend from me - food is fresh, delicious, & quick to come and while the prices are higher than other pho places, the portions are decent and the quality is consistent."}
{"text":"It was ok, nothing great.

Service was friendly, but lacking.  They brought both the appetizers and mains at the same time.  Had all the food, but still didn't bring us our drinks.  And it wasn't very busy in there.

Food portions are big, but the food itself was average at best.  The food was ok, but I was disappointed compared to other places I have been.

Overall an average, but disappointing experience.  It's unlikely I'll go back."}
{"text":"This is one of the few pho places we go to when my wife needs her pho fix.  They recently updated their menu and it looks like they updated the decor as well.  

I would give it an extra star but the last time I came here the food portions seemed smaller.  

The beef spring roll is worth a try.  We always get it.  

Even though this place only got 3 stars, we would probably come back again.  It is not the best pho but it satisfies a craving."}
{"text":"Typical pho joint that uses soup mix resulting in salty and flat tasting soup,  disappointment because I believe the owners are actually Vietnamese,  there are places around that still make their soup from scratch, the difference is night and day,  you haven't had phos until you've had the real thing"}
{"text":"Pho Metro (Markham) is an excellent Vietnamese restaurant and is probably the best one around in Markham. We tried the pho, the vermicelli, the bun bo hue, and they were all fantastic.I highly recommend them all. 

I was really impressed with their vermicelli, it's not something I order often but I was blown away by it. They use the good kind of vermicelli and not some extremely thick one, some places do. The pork and chicken was flavorful, and the spring roll was crisp too. There was plenty of veggies which is something a lot of places don't do. The the only downside was that there wasn't enough vermicelli, which is kind of a weird complaint because there was plenty of meat! 

The noodle soups were both excellent. Great broth (broth that you want to actually have more of), noodles, and tons of toppings make for a great bowl of pho. Portion size could have been a tad larger but quality trumps quantity here."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place after reading so many positive reviews.  Ok so here's my take on their Banh mi. 

I opted for the traditional cold cuts and pate Banh mi. The size and texture of the baguette was more like a sub than a baguette.  It was soft on the outside, dense and chewy inside. Filling, while generous, lacked taste. Pate was 'gritty' not smooth. I asked for spicy and tasted only a hint of heat. I ended up only eating about two thirds of it because of all the 'bread'. 

All in all i was disappointed. I've had better Banh mi elsewhere."}
{"text":"Pricey compared to the pho restaurants in markham. Overall okay but for someone who has a family member who is vegetarian it would have been better if they offered a veggie broth as an option for pho soup as well. Other then that everything we ordered was really good."}
{"text":"Service: excellent. Polite , attentive staff.
Location: clean
Food: I got the rare beef pho. The ingredients were extremely fresh, and the beef paper thin slices. Really appreciated this as I don't enjoy thick rare meat. This was like a proper carpaccio and better than any other pho place we've been to. Only complaint: broth was not super flavourful. It was just plain boiled beef broth.

Having said that, I've been there 2wice now after dental surgery as it's the only food I can eat, and getting nutrition after a procedure in the form of edible protein and carb will keep me going there for a while 

++ the lady was sweet enough to give me a bag of ice when my gums were hurting!"}
{"text":"Had the pho dac biet, the soup was okay very clear, rare beef was tender had two eye ball size beef balls kind of cheap but the noodles was plentiful for a medium size bowl.  This place nothing special for the pho anyways. Place is clean and service is good."}
{"text":"Mediocre - not the worst and not the best.  Okay for the burbs but would be a solid 2 or maybe a 1.5 if it were in Toronto, but since there is no competition in Ajax I would give it a 3.  Its clean and popular / busy - the pricepoint is out of synch in my opinion and priced a bit on the high-side of the pricing scale.  I should knock off a point for that but I didn't.  Always busy so there is definitely a need for more Pho places in the area...I guess Pho Metro has the market cornered here so it can give mediocre meh Pho at overpriced costs and still succeed in their business model.  I don't go too often but if you need a Pho fix and in the Ajax area its worth a shot (just don't expect anything phenomenal its Meh+ at best)"}
{"text":"Gone to pho metro and the food was ok, got a combo of grilled chicken with rice, salad, fried egg and spring roll for 12.99.  I would say reasonable price but the thing that surprised me was if you use card by paying either debit or credit is that they charge you $2 for it, very ridiculous as other stores would charge most likely $1.50 for using credit card, but using your debit card, you'll still get charged?!! Not going back again as for 1 combo had cost me $16.68 regardless of what card you use. Overpriced and nothing fancy about the place"}
{"text":"My colleague keeps telling me how good Pho Metro is ever since I started here 2 years ago, but because their first store is located at Lawrence area, I never had a chance to go (too lazy to drive ALL the way from Markham to there). When I heard they opened up a store in Markham, I decided to come here right away!

After a few visits, I have to say, the hype from my colleague was accurate. The pho is well-done here and it is actually opened by Vietnamese! Soup base is also very good, not too salty and the flavour is perfect. Beef is also very good so my go to choice is ALWAYS the Large beef flakes pho.

Their fried spring roll is also pretty decent, although the size is a little smaller, but the taste is great. Looking for a quick pho place in markham? I highly recommend pho metro!"}
{"text":"Coming back from cottage country, needed a quick yummy stop before heading downtown. This was a great find. The bun bo hue was great and the pho was tasty. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Tried their house special vermicelli and Bun Rieu. Both were delicious and came in large portions. 

UPDATE: they now accept credit card! (For both credit and debit card, they charge you $2 for bills under $20). AND they are part of Vicinity! $1 = 1 point (75 points = free drink etc. check Vicinity's website for more info)."}
{"text":"Friday Night and there is a line up at their door. Went inside to the cashier and listed my name of their priority list. Was seated in 10 mins. Service was quick. Food is great and considered very cheap for their huge portions. Will surely comeback and bring other friends to taste their food."}
{"text":"Had the beef noodle, soup is okay, noodle is okay, lack of meat, I have had way better pho tho. Restaurant is very clean, better than 80% of the pho restaurants out there."}
{"text":"This has become my spot for damn good Vietnamese food. My favourites are the pho with beef brisket, vermicelli with grilled chicken and spring roll. I always get the ice coffee to go with every meal, yum. The staff is very friendly and have gotten to know some of them through the months. 

Best to make it before 7 if you don't want to wait because the secret is out and everyone knows this is the place to go for good pho in Wexford."}
{"text":"Love the bun bo hue here! I haven't found another place that makes it as good. It's got the right amount of spicy in the soup, and good portion of sausage and beef. Just expect the beef to be tendon-y. Can't go wrong with the deep fried pork and shrimp spring rolls either. Finish off with the house made coconut water, and you've got my favourite pho combo.

It gets quite busy at lunch time so make sure to come a bit earlier if you've got more than 2 ppl."}
{"text":"One of the newest restaurants in Scarborough (a friend told me it opened in May 2010), I went here with my friend and a group of cool people he was hanging out with to grab some lunch. Most of the people in our party (10+ people) ordered Vermicelli noodle dishes since it was during the summer time. Only a few people ordered pho or another type of noodle dish. 

I had the B7, the Bun Bo Nuong, Cha Gio, which was the Grilled Beef with Spring Rolls with Vermicelli and vegetables. I thought it was a really tasty and filling noodle dish. Vegetables were chilled and fresh, the vinaigrette and peanut bits made the lettuce and noodles tastier to eat. The beef was delicious and flavourful. The Spring Rolls were initially really hot, fresh off the kitchen, but had the right amount of crispiness on the outside, and was so warm, soft, and somewhat meaty on the inside. This place probably had one of the best Spring Rolls I have eaten in the Toronto area so far, and surprisingly better than the ones in the Vietnamese restaurants back in Boston.

The person sitting next to me, ordered a large P1, the Pho Dac Biet, which Pho with various slices of beef, such as flank and tendon. I did not get to eat it, but it appeared that they are generous with the beef portions and they give somewhat thicker noodles compared to the Pho places in Boston. My friend got the B5, the Bun Thit Nuong, Cha Gio, which is the same dish I got, but with grilled pork, rather than grilled beef.  

Decor appears to be simple but clean. They have a big flat screen TV where you can watch some news to keep you informed about what's going on in Canada and other places around the world (they were showing CTV News). Overall, I thought this is a pretty good Vietnamese restaurant with solid food and I would not mind coming back here again for a decent dish."}
{"text":"These guys are awesome. Wonderful food and great service. My only qualm is that their takeout containers could be better as the food can easily leak out."}
{"text":"Well I moved from the downtown core and need to replace all my fave spots or I'm gonnae bloody starve. I used Yelp and found Pho Metro. So off we trekked on our Vietnamese adventure. 
I ordered the cold shrimp and pork rolls, one of my favourites and rare beef pho, my friend ordered grilled beef bun vermicelli and veggie spring rolls and we also got a side of Vietnamese sausage. 
Service was great staff were excellent and lovely. 
The food was delicious, portion sizes were terrific. A few places I've been scrimp on noodles and beef and Thai basil when you order the pho, not this place. The shrimp and pork rolls were lovely and fresh, it was nice to have the pork back in them as so many places now only offer just shrimp. Jessica loooooved her beef vermicelli and stuffed her face with sausage. 
I ordered the house special bun vermicelli for my lunch today and when I was packing it this morning it smelled delicious. I may just have to eat it for breakfast instead. 
Great first experience it's easily accessible by transit and not far from home. I will most definitely be back as I used to have my Vietnamese fix weekly."}
{"text":"If you look at the history of my reviews, you will find MANY reviews of pho restaurants and Vietnamese places in general. I like to think that I sort of know what I'm talking about when I review these places. A pho pho-natic, if you will.

It's tough to stand out as a Vietnamese restaurant in Scarborough. To say that they're a dime-a-dozen would be an understatement. But Pho Metro has to be applauded for being the quintessential pho restaurant - they are everything you want from a pho restaurant and exactly nothing else. Do you want to end off a late night with a semi-substantial meal? This is probably your best bet. Hungover to death and craving something soup-y? This is the place to go.

Since my first visit to Pho Metro just a few months ago, I've gone multiple times, just because I know exactly what to expect every single time. The end result is consistent - delicious broth, a generous serving of noodles and meat (relative to size), and incredibly quick service. Sure, they might not be winning any Michelin stars, but that's not the point. Pho Metro sticks to what they're good at,and that, to me, is a beautiful thing."}
{"text":"Came out of the gym one day after my regular dinner hour and wandered into this Viet joint,  my hope was not high because I had been blessed to be introduced to the cannot-be-more-authentic Vietnamese restaurants in the city's west end,  but I must say I was very pleasantly surprised by the authenticity and variety of true Viet foods it has available. Still doesn't compare to the west end but in Scarborough,  I dare say they have the best selections. The bon bo hue (H4 on the menu)  and crab paste pork soup pho (H9) are very satisfying if you're more than just a regular house special pho person. The rice was the bomb, with the special Vietnamese crushed rice. Yet to try their bon (dry mix rice noodles) but I don't think I will be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food's delicious. Our server was kind of reluctant to give us plates for the shared mango salad though. Was she having a bad day? Maybe it was us. Were we too annoying? What had to have happened to warrant such a hesitant response from her? And why would she only bring 5 plates when there were 7 of us?

Also, I don't know exactly what the city of Toronto rules are for restaurants, but when I see a server at Pho Metro eating behind the cash counter and then not washing their hands before returning to prepare and serve food, it makes me wonder.

Anyway, the food's great, and that's why we keep coming back."}
{"text":"Great place I'd say especially when finding an Asian restaurant is not an easy thing in Ajax. In comparison to Mississauga, where we have quite a few Vietnamese restaurants, Pho Metro is definitely on point. The interior is nicely done and modern and it is situated in a nice plaza with a Metro, LCBO etc. Great location! 
I had to stick to the usual pho and the soup base was tasty and not overly salty. It did not make me wanna drink a gallon of water which is definitely a positive note :P The summer rolls with shrimp were quite good and it was not overly stuffed with vermicelli. The amount of pho noodles I got were quite generous and the meat portion was just right.
The service was great and food came out quickly. I liked how they had a TV too. Oh! They also have wifi..and it actually works!

This is definitely not a bad place (quite good imo) especially when there are not many in this area to choose from. It is also busy on a weekday which is great to see. 
So grab your groceries and alcoholic beverages, run your errands and get a bowl of pho!"}
{"text":"I have been here so many times over the years and can truly say that the food is soo delicious. My go-to dishes are the pho obviously, pad thai, fresh spring rolls, and on days where I go all out - the deep friend spring rolls. SO GOOD.

The people are so friendly and service is fast! Highly, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Came here after a movie because this was one of the few places that's quick and still open nearby. At 9:30pm, pho metro was still decently busy.

The menu was extensive and we ended up choosing the special pho and house special vermicelli. 

House Special Vermicelli- grilled beef, grilled pork, shrimp paste on sugar cane and comes with one of their ever so popular fried spring roll. The grilled meats sliced thin and well seasoned. The spring roll was crispy and the shrimp paste sugar cane still had lots of juice to chew on. Recommend coming hungry for this or bringing someone to share. The portion is huge! 

House special pho- rare beef, beef balls, tripe, flank. The broth was fragrant and didn't leave me incredibly thirsty like most pho joints which tells me that little/no MSG is probably used. The beef was oh so tender.

I think this is one of the best pho places in Scarborough in terms of value. The quality of the ingredients were all very good. Will definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"I went to Pho Metro for lunch the other day with my family, and I may say that this place will now be my go-to Pho restaurant.
Their space is decently sized, but it does get very packed during lunch hours to the point where people are waiting outside to get seated.

We ordered a medium bowl of their Pho with beef balls and rare beef along with their fresh and fried spring rolls. Their broth in their pho was almost perfect and not too salty. The spring rolls were also amazing and all ingredients tasted very fresh. 

I would of given this restaurant 5 stars, but there was a miscommunication with how the bill was being paid and they took a while to solve the issue.

Overall, I would definitely come back soon to taste more of what they have on their menu."}
{"text":"Excellent broth.   Great service weekdays,  weekend not so much but food is still top notch."}
{"text":"my colleagues love pho metro and i definitely understand why! it's a family run restaurant so they're all super nice. serve is super fast which is convenient and appreciated. we all had different versions of their pho, mainly rare beef and something. i got the rare beef with satay (not spicy in my opinion) but i loved that they brought fresh chilis and provided scissors for me! major brownie points. the soup was very good and homemade but i do prefer a stronger broth with more bone flavour. the portions are average size, they have small to x-large. i would definitely come back and try one of their rice dishes or vermicelli!"}
{"text":"So this place is literally under 5 mins from my house. Never had the chance to try it as our usual place is in the opposite plaza..

My friend invited me here for lunch,  so I decided to check this place out...the lunch special is a steal.. For $9.50, you get a small pho, a spring roll and a pop...definitely can't go wrong there...the pho broth was pretty good, I didn't feel super thirsty afterwards due to the msg...so I was quite impressed by it...

Came back the second time,  the week after, decided to try to bun rieu, and I was so disappointed, it was extreme sodium, couldn't taste a thing besides the sodium....that's when it went for 4** to 3.5...we order the egg roll with some side veggies, forgot what it was called but the real Vietnamese version is supposed to be filled with shrimp or seafood...they gave us a whole lot of bean sprouts...mehh.... 

All in all,  just come for the pho and you'll be good..."}
{"text":"Thanks Yelpers, for helping me find a new favourite pho joint! I am such a fan of this place. Its on the southeast corner of Lawrence and Warden, with a small parking lot in front. I showed up around 1pm on a Sunday and they were super busy with a small line. They are well run though - the friendly lady behind the counter noticed me right away and since I was on my own, I was able to be seated immediately.

They have menus sitting on the table for you to peruse, and the waiter came by pretty quickly with a menu sheet and pen for me to write down what I wanted (as well as some complimentary Chinese tea). They do more than just pho (think vermicelli bowls and grilled food too) but I knew I wanted the bun bo hue. I wasn't sure on the size since they have S, M and L (a lot of places I've been to only have S and L), and he pointed at another table's bowls to show me the difference between a M and L - I went with a M, which looked like the regular 'large' size I would normally get in Edmonton or Montreal. 

My bun bo hue came out pretty much about 5 minutes after placing my order. It was really, really fast! I've never been to Hue but I've tried bun bo hue from many different restaurants, and this is one of the better ones. The broth has a great flavour, aromatic with the lemongrass, and subtly spicy all the way to the end with the chili shrimp paste. It had an excellent ratio of meat to noodle to soup - there was lots of meat, enough noodles for me to have a bite with every bite of meat, and broth left until the end (I'm a heavy broth consumer - at some places I run out of broth before I'm done eating the meat and noodles). The meat is a few slices of the Vietnamese sausage (kind of like deli meat) and beef shank-type pieces that have this awesome crunchy cartilage-like bits in them. It's totally up my alley but if you don't like that texture, then you probably won't like this.

The restaurant stayed busy right up until I left. As with other pho joints, this one is child/family friendly. Unlike other pho joints, this one is not sketchy and dirty (much appreciated). I did find the price a bit higher than expected (it ended up being over $10 for my bowl) but I feel that it is worth it. They also accept payment via debit and credit if your bill is over $20. I'll definitely be back to try the regular pho and other dishes!"}
{"text":"In a word \"delicious\", I ordered the lunch special combo a which included a freshly made fried shrimp roll unique and extremely tasty, followed by all the accompaniments you would expect with Pho. My waiter was awesome very friendly the restaurant is very simple Nothing fancy lunch specials including tip was like 17 bucks; Oh and enough broth to bring home And enjoy later in the  was plentiful"}
{"text":"I wish people would stop referring Viet food with Pho.  There's so much more to it , such as Viet pancake.  This place has good Shrimp Pad Thai, Chicken Fried Rice & Pork Chop + rice."}
{"text":"Shares  the raw beef and brisket noodle with kid -very tasty. Husband had a rice dish with beef, pork, chicken and egg - also quite tasty.  Kid also has mango smoothie - excellent as it was not too sweet like some other places."}
{"text":"If your looking for good Vietnamese food in Markham then you have to check out pho metro.  The pork chop with rice is my fav.  Even better they have that on the lunch special menu.  Spring rolls are really good too and you have to try the mango slush.  Service is really good and the bathrooms are really clean."}
{"text":"Closest DECENT Pho place to where my husband and I live. The pho itsekf is good but I wouldn't say the best with the broth. Although they do give you plenty of beef. I also have tried their grilled bbq chicken with rice which again was nothing special. If you want bbq chicken at a Vietnamese restaurant the best I've had so far is one at east China town with the train logo (xu Lau or something like that). Again nothing special and nothing bad."}
{"text":"This place rocks.  We've been there a bunch of times.  Ate there for lunch, dinner and ordered for a party at our place.  Talk about a family run restaurant that is warm and welcoming.  Ben and Tu are great.  They will come and talk to you, offer the right things on the menu and take care of you and your family.  

The price is right for the meals.  Well cooked and great taste.

A must:  the spring rolls.  Dear god... they are good.  I mean really good.  Rumor has it, another Vietnamese restaurant sent spies to steal the recipe. 

We used to frequent other Pho shops but this one ruined it for us.  Now, this is the only place we want to eat Vietnamese food.

Spread the word... eat their food."}
{"text":"This is my go-to Vietnamese restaurant for fresh and delicious food at reasonable prices. Of all the Vietnamese restaurants in the GTA, Pho Metro makes the best pho and best vermicelli dishes, in my opinion.  

For the pho, the portion size is above average, it contains NO cilantro (important for those who hate cilantro, such as my girlfriend), its broth is not too salty yet tasty, and they don't skimp out on the meat. That's a winning combination right there. 

As for their vermicelli dishes, I almost always order this whenever I go. I tend to get the B8 which contains grilled chicken, grilled pork, and a spring roll. Like the pho, they don't skimp out on the meat! Everything in their vermicelli offering is a home run!

Lunch time is hectic, so don't expect to get a seat unless you arrive before 12pm from Mon-Fri."}
{"text":"A decent pho place in Markham considering there aren't any pho restaurants in Markham.

I ordered some spicy beef and pork noodle soup. 

Sadly the noodles weren't to my liking. Sure it's noodles but if it was the pho soup noodles it could have made the dish much better. 

The broth was good though. It tasted like lemon grass, satay, peanuts. 

I would come back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"I came across Pho Metro on Toronto Life's \"100 Best Cheap Eats\" List. This Vietnamese kitchen is located in an unassuming plaza on Lawrence past Warden. 

A constant inflow of people kept the place busy until close. 

I ordered the beef pho. Comparable to some of the better pho's I've enjoyed over the years. Meat was succulent, broth rich, and veggies fresh. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"It's a great to finally find a go-to pho place in the Markham north area. After years of waiting it seems we are finally getting some decent Vietnamese comfort food in the area.

Let's get down to it. The broth is very flavourful, clear and served piping hot. The noodles are done right; still al dente. Their cuts of meat are above average; beef is beef, brisket is brisket. Often times, a lot of places they will serve what I call brisket lard -- basically the beef is so fatty they look like chunks of butter floating in your soup. I have a lot of respect for places that pay attention to the finer details. One thing I will mention because they absolutely have overachieved in this category is their service.

Shakes and sides along with appetizers are all nicely done with quality ingredients. Nothing is going to really wow you here but then again it certainly does not disappoint. The menu is somewhat limited when compared to some of the more popular pho places in the city but it's not a deal breaker by any means.

Definitely my go-to place for Vietnamese comfort food in the 905-- especially with winter looming on the horizon."}
{"text":"I did a review of the Markham location of the same restaurant and gave them a higher score. Of course the way I see it is...there's zero competition for pho up there so hence they are definitely the gold standard up there. However, Scarberia has a plethora of pho options and while this place does make the cut, it does so barely.

I was mostly annoyed with my extra large pho that is somewhat closer to medium in my books. Now before you throw your arms up in disbelief I am a small guy and my appetite is rather small. I was still hungry after my XL pho! The beef while is marginally better grade than most hardly exists (okay exaggerated a bit). It does but just in smaller quantities than one would hope for. The broth is better than most and the noodles are on point for sure! Also, the grilled chicken pho is definitely an overachievement! Service is adequate.

Is this place worth going to? Hell yeah! Are you going to leave hungry? Probably..."}
{"text":"Pho Metro is definitely my go-to comfort food in Markham - hands down! Really delicious grilled chicken with vermicelli, good viet iced coffee, awesome service."}
{"text":"Yay!  I'm still a fan!  Just to update, the portions are MUCH better now.  Large is indeed a large (might still be smaller compared to some other Viet restaurants).  The quality of it beats out other Vietnamese cuisine in the area."}
{"text":"Surprised to find another staple Viet spot I will be visitting!! I feel like so many viet places have gone down hill, so coming here with my family, I was not expecting much. That just makes it all the better to find you love the food!!

I had the vermicelli. They didn't come with the toppings I normally would want so I tried the grilled beef with spring rolls. It was really good and the noodles were bouncy and warm. I love that the ratio of veggies to noodles made sense so you had a nice mix per bite. Some places give you too much of the noodles or of the veggies and it's a bit unsettling haha. 

The grilled meat had a lot of good flavour so I was really happy with it. My mom got the same dish but with Pork and that was really good as well. 

My dad ordered the crab soup base noodles and it was not bad! quite flavourful but wish there was more seafood/crab meat in there. Meanwhile my boyfriend ordered a regular pho noodles special. I think that's the dish you start off with to just make sure this place is really getting its stuff together haha. The meats were good, no frozen flavour. The soup base was nice and not too salty. I think it was well portioned for an average appetite. I prefer the bun though so I'm glad I stuck with my non-soup noodles :)

Give it a try! It's a great place to fill that craving we all get for Viet food. Mmmm!!"}
{"text":"This was a pretty solid pho place in Ajax considering there after not many Asian food locations with an authentic menu. 

I ordered regular noodles with grilled pork and spring rolls. The spring rolls were good and the noodles weren't too mushy or anything. The meat, however, was extremely salty. I had a hard time finishing that bowl to be honest. 

I usually like to mix in the spring roll sauce which is basically fish sauce with sugar and picked veggies. They don't have that here. They have a fish sauce container that doesn't have that sweet, tangy delicious taste. Most other Viet places make that sauce in house so it's a bit different everywhere. I didn't enjoy the bottled sauce here though. It was just really salty and no other flavor. 

The staff here are very very friendly though and are happy to hear what you think at the end of the meal. It looks like they have a few Chinese style dishes as well so definitely can give them a try. We tried the black bean sauce on fried ho fan (flat noodles) and short ribs. Again it was salty, but also the meat seemed to have been tenderized with some acidic mixture so it's soft. I'm not sure I like my protein broken down that way. But give it a try if you like. Over all it was alright."}
{"text":"Soup base is pungent and delicious.
Noodles are good quality, thin and most importantly al dente.
Beef is tender, even the well done beef.

Like most agree, it's the best pho you can get in Markham.

Huge variety of Vietnamese food and drinks. I love their Vietnamese ice coffee.

Made this review short for our readers with A.D.D. like me. lol"}
{"text":"It's a hit and miss sometimes at this place. I find the broth is overly salty at times. I only eat the pho and vermicelli here anything else I've tried I didn't like."}
{"text":"3.5 stars!

Very busy! Deep fried spring rolls are the best! 

The shrimp paste on sugar cane was awesome! A nice contrast of savoury from the shrimp and sweet from the sugar cane. 

The bun was okay. I wasn't really fan of the vietnamese sausage. It was a bit dry. I've had better. I also didn't like the noodles they used for it. 

The pho booth was good. Not too salty. The beef was very tender. 

The soup sop smoothie was delicious! 

Prices are slightly higher than other places, but the portions are really big. 

The washroom was also clean, which is a bonus for an Asian place! 

Overall, I would definitely come back here!!!"}
{"text":"Relatively reasonable taste. We tried the rare beef pho, glass noodles, pad Thai and pork bun. Good service, clean and comfortable seating. Slightly higher price point for Asian cuisine"}
{"text":"The pho is really good.  That's because their soup base is really good and the meat is really tasty.  The spring rolls is better than alot of others I've tried. It comes really hot that means is not re-fried and they just fried it when you order it.  This is opened by Vietnamese people not some Chinese person pretending to make pho.  I was pleasantly surprise how good this place is.  It's cleaner than many Vietnamese store in the area. Their avocado smoothie and mango smoothie are really good too.  It's a small place and their menu is very simple.  Is not an upscale restaurant.  Very simple pho place."}
{"text":"Vermicelli was awesome! Pho tastes awesome! Great relaxed atmosphere. TV available! I didn't like the avocado smoothie. Didn't have enough much taste. I think they didn't use enough avocado and ripe ones. Ah well the food was still pretty good. The plaza is super quiet. Overall great location and delicious food. Hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Been looking around for a new pho spot. Had the house special pho and the clear wrap spring rolls. Everything tasted good. Very impressed with the quality of the rolls. The pho dac biet was good, but doesn't come in the \"wash basin\" size. Broth lacked strong flavors but was still tasty, would not call it watered down. Decent quantity of meat but nothing notable. Place overall felt clean. Also recommend the Vietnamese coffee."}
{"text":"Best Pho in town hands down!!!

The pho soup is always fresh and the broth is piping hot. I have tried other items on the menu such as their vermicelli bowls and the spring rolls and it's always super tasty. The restaurant is always clean and the washrooms are always sparkling. Service is fast and the staff and owners are always friendly and very accommodating."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the Vietnamese food here. Doesn't matter if you're craving for Pho, Vermicelli, Pad Thai or rice paper rolls, they offer all the said above here and they comes with a good portion size and very yummy.

I've been here 3 times so far and I never get disappointed with the food and service I get. it's gets busy here during prime lunch and dinner hours, sometimes you have to wait for a bit for a seat. But usually you don't have to, or the wait is generally short as people comes in and out very fast.

My favourite is the meat ball Pho, and I always get the medium. For girls or even some guys medium should be good enough because it's still quite a lot. I ordered large once and I couldn't finish it. 

The service here is great too. Servers are busy here but very attentive. The service is friendly and fast.

Probably the best Vietnamese resturant you can find in Scarborough."}
{"text":"We went here for 1st time today and had a great time. We ordered take out as this place was too busy and packed which shows that the food is very good & popular. My mom's friends who are Vietnamese recommended this place. I agree with their feed back. This is one of the very few Vietnamese places in the East end that we actually found really good, great portions and authentic. The staff are all Vietnamese and it is Vietnamese fun. Very authentic. The Vermicelli Bun Dac Biet is really good, Bun Bo Hue (Spicy Soup) and Banh Hoi is really good too. We ordered B1, S1, H4. All very good. Would come back for more take out again! :)"}
{"text":"*Jan 29, 2018* The food here is yummy!! The I had pho  and side orders of ribs, pork and chicken. The young man at the front was so polite and easy I talk too! It was a lot of food, I shared with my mom and took some to work for lunch *good portions*"}
{"text":"Solid spot for Pho, definitely one of the better spots in Markham (better than Pho 99 by Markville for sure) . Good service, quick to serve and decently priced. Would say its a 3.5 but closer to a 4 than a 3. No complaints but nothing spectacular.

Food 3.5/5 - I ordered a large bowl of pho with rare beef + beef balls and that was 9.25. Beef as nice and soft, and both the beef and beef balls were nice and flavourful but not too salty. The same goes for the soup base. It came with a sufficient amount of noodles, but I felt there could have been a little bit more meat. I also felt that the beef could have been rarer + the soup even hotter when I got it, but thats just personal preference.

Service 4/5 - Good service, the waiter was friendly and polite. I got my bowl of pho pretty quick so I was pretty happy about that. The waiter also asked me how my meal went afterwards, which is actually kind of rare for a lot of Asian restaurants. Restaurant was also quite clean as I noticed that the waiter immediately cleaned the tables as soon as people left + recleaned tables.

Price 3.5/5 - As I said, I feel like there could have been a bit more meat, overall the price was fair."}
{"text":"Okay pho, a little salty for my taste and very different than the Scarborough location. The Scarborough location you could taste the freshness of the meats used but this location didn't offer the same. A little pricy but expected because it is in Ajax. The decor is really modern and nice but if you want Pho stay in Scarborough or head to Whitby."}
{"text":"Great bowl of pho. The broth has a hint of fish sauce which was different but what set it apart was the quality of ingredients. The beef, brisket and tripe was very fresh. You can taste the different compared to other pho places."}
{"text":"Look,  a lot of reviews especially when it comes to pho places is about the smallest little details. Now having eaten pho a few times but not a whole lot recently, the is place was very refreshing. 

Atmosphere, nice and comfortable. The typical Chop sticks, spoons hoison, sriacha, chili, etc. Fresh basil and bean sprouts as well. So the same for a lot of pho places. Lots of different items but their pho is very nice. The traditional mixed beef pho is delicious, good broth, lots of meat. Love the spring roll they have, very large, lots of pieces and tastes great. 

Would go here again as it's tremendous value and a nice one for me living in Stouffville. About 10-12 min away."}
{"text":"\"Good pho place to satisfy that pho craving in North Ajax. Very similar to the one in Markham. \"

I frequent the one in Markham (Kennedy road/bur oak) and this place has the same menu do its consistent with what you'd expect from a pho place. Food under $10 with lots of options on pho and other items. 

Atmosphere 

I'd say it resembles a typical AYCE place in terms of seating. Fairly large dining room and waiting area which I hope means they get busy during key times. All of the key stuff on the table, including vinegars, sriracha, chili paste, soy and hoisin sauce as well as napkins, chop sticks and spoons. The older design has a \"greasy spoon\" vibe in a good way similar to other pho places on the west end and down town. 

Food

I'd you're craving it, it's good. It's typical of a pho place. I of course got the house special pho and was impressed with the combination  of beef, and still rare steak. Nice touch. 

A mis step if I had to say there was one was that the noodles were the dry kind and were smushed in a small bowl then added to the pho. It was a little tough to mix and get at. But given a few minutes they softened and loosened up. 

Kinda wish they had the option for flat noodles or fresh noodles too. 

All in all a good place to satisfy the pho craving, especially in the area."}
{"text":"For a guy that has never been exposed to more than pho as Vietnamese food, this place was phenomenal. I went with a Viet friend who helped with the orders, and must say that everything was excellent. From the bowl of pho to the shrimp rolls, everything was done very well and had good flavours. I particularly enjoyed the grilled pork in the dishes. Very satisfied with my meal."}
{"text":"Popped in just after lunch and it was still pooping. Very quickly and friendly greet at the door by one of the staff members. 

Menu was standard Vietnam-pho menu with delicious options. 

Ordered and food was on the table within 5 mins. I ordered the beef brisket pho (not to be confused with the fatty brisket) and my guest ordered the rare beef. 

The broth was very hot, fresh and flavourful. The brisket was perfectly cooked with very little fat. 

The service was great despite being super busy - even at an off time. 

Solid 4 stars for this great place!"}
{"text":"The Good
I was able to make a reservation over the phone very easily and make a last minute change over the phone to increase our numbers by four, to fourteen. No problem.

The Bad
The food came out in a reasonable amount of time after we ordered but the flavour was just about average to a little better than average.
Our spring rolls were served to the wrong table and we didn't get ours until the mains showed up. They were long and skinny, like a cheap cigar. It was supposed to be stuffed with shrimp and pork but I saw mostly vermicelli and carrots.
One of our diners had ordered a steamed vermicelli dish that included chicken, pork sausage, shrimps and vegetables. Halfway through his meal, a server brought him some rice paper wraps that were supposed to be included. Hmmm, kinda late. There was also a sheet of plastic between each wrap. Odd.
Service was poor, at best. We had to call a server over several times for water, more tea, and additional orders. They just placed the food on the table and left us alone. No follow-up.

The Ugly,
While reaching across the table to deliver an order, our server dropped a bowl of fish sauce that bounced off the table, spilling most of it on my leg and on my friend seated next to me. The table was also soaked in fish sauce and we grabbed a whole bunch of napkins from the dispenser on the table to soak it up. There wasn't much of an apology for the mishap and ZERO attempt to clean up the mess. The wet napkins sat on the table for the entire meal! So did the overturned empty bowl. No discount was offered for the inconvenience or cleaning costs. Fish sauce may taste good but it doesn't smell good! Thankfully, I had no other plans for the evening.
All the empty plates and bowls sat on the table until we left.
For the record, despite the fish sauce incident, there was no tension or mean comments between us and the staff. There was just no interaction. No service.

Forget about three strikes, these guys fouled out on the first pitch. Game over."}
{"text":"I had the house special rice vermicelli. It was actually really good. The protein was cooked perfectly and really tasty. The spring rolls were also crispy and tasty. I also had it with iced coffee which you can't go wrong with. No complaints here. I would come here again and try other things."}
{"text":"The food was good but not really that outstanding for the extra bucks.  It ' more pricey than other Viet places.  It I pass by, I might visit them again.  But I won't make the extra drive there."}
{"text":"It was an OK experience. I tried the pad thai, it was kind of oily and a little too sweet for my taste. The other two diners I was with tried the pork pho and grilled chicken pho. Nothing too spectacular, but we have had better. The pork and shrimp spring roll was delicious. 

Service was alright but there was a language barrier with one of the servers and we had to put in a request with the English speaking service who took our original order. It seemed to be pretty busy with only two servers. 

Only bad impression was they gave us a small pho when we ordered a medium and charged us for a medium. We had to correct them twice - Once with the bill and then with the debt machine. So I suggest you keep an eye on your bill and serving sizes. 

Overall it was an OK place. Don't think I will be going back though unfortunately."}
{"text":"Finally a pho that tastes great, with good service and a LARGE SIZE is actually large. I finish it without feeling hungry still like other pho places."}
{"text":"Finally there is a pho in Markham that the broth is not loaded with MSG (I am looking at you Kim Po).  The pho was solid good.  The noodle was thin.  The portion of the beef was okay.  The broth was okay.  The services was friendly enough.  Hence, to me, the pluses here is the limited usage of MSG, yet things still taste."}
{"text":"We wanted to try this place out for their bun rieu dish. It was quite underwhelming. The rieu crab mixture had very little crab and tasted more like a pork patty. It also came with pork ribs which were quite soft. The tomato broth was too light and didn't have much crab flavor. It was also $10 which is quite a bit for a dish that didn't seem to have much crab flavor. 
We also ordered spring rolls with pork and shrimp. It was quite skinny which was odd so it didn't have much filling."}
{"text":"We ordered house special pho and the banh hoi. Both dish are delicious. Really liked the broth in the pho. The banh hoi was so good too, I really enjoyed making my own wraps.

Would definitely come back to eat pho again and try other items."}
{"text":"We had their house special pho, and the rare beef satay.  Great broth!  Worth noting that their satay is broth based, unlike the most pho restaurant's peanut based satay.  The chili oil they put in the satay was amazing!  Courteous staff. Clean, bright, and newly updated washrooms. We will definitely return!  This is our new pho spot from now on. :)"}
{"text":"My favourite pho in Toronto. The spicy pho's are excellent. Friendly owners, great service. Decor is modern and nice, very clean and bright inside."}
{"text":"It was my second time going to that restaurant. The food is alright. On my last visited I took some takeout and I was forced to pay cash or debit (and my order was over 15$). I didn't understand why because on Yelp and on their door its says that they accept credit cards. Also, when I was paying with the debit machine, it was set up so you have to give a tip even do you pick up only. After the cashier saw that I didn't want to leave a tip, he did something on the computer that allowed me to only pay for my meal. I wasn't sure what to think about all that. It bothered me to be honest. Not sure If I'll go back."}
{"text":"I came here to try out their pho.  I had been to their Scarborough location before and enjoyed it.  So when it opened up in Markham I knew it was worth a try.

I ordered P1. Special rice noodle soup w/ rare beef, beef balls, beef flank, beef tripe (Medium $8.25)

Food came very fast.  Fresh and less MSG.  I like this place.  Service is friendly, restaurant is new and not noisy, menu is new and clean.  I took my time and enjoyed the food.  I will return next time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"I've been a big fan of their Scarborough location for years and when I found out that there was a Pho Metro location in Ajax, my heart skipped a beat.   I drove out there the first, second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth chance I had and the verdict was a sadly disappointing no.  

Although the dining room here is a lot more comfortable/clean/bright than the Scarborough location, the food suffers from being \"durhamized.\"  :(  Gone are the chunks of blood jellos, pork hocks from my beloved bun bo hue.  Amount of satay sauce in my satay beef pho is nowhere near enough that I have to ask for 2 refills of the sauce to impart any satay flavour to my pho.  

Every visit here (and it's been too many) has been just one disappointment after another and having found Viet Delight not too long ago, I am not sure if I would be back to this location."}
{"text":"5 Stars!

After numerous satisfying meals at Pho Metro, I thought I should really write an update on their customer care aspect.  

As most of our previous visits here have been pre-parenthood, it was definitely something else to eat here with a little one.  Although there was no change table, they had clean high chairs where my little girl happily sat and watched the servers busying about with gigantic bowls of steaming pho.  We ordered our standard pho with rare beef and tripe and pho with flank.  As our server took the order, she recommended that I change my order to pho with brisket as the flank tends to be tougher to chew.  So I did...not really knowing why she made such a recommendation until later.  

And just before our order came, an older lady serving us brought over a small plastic bowl with a tiny scissor, a plastic spoon and a fork for my daughter to partake in our meal.  Now, her earlier recommendation for not-as-chewy brisket made sense.  Not only was she thinking of what she thought my daughter may be eating but she also brought over what my daughter could eat with.  This was completely unexpected but very much appreciated.  It's not very often that we eat out at restaurants where they take their tiny patrons in mind as well.  

We certainly appreciated this very nice gesture and my little one (11 months old) got to taste her very first pho at what I consider to be one of the tastiest pho restos in T.O.
I'm happy to say she enjoyed her first pho experience and we certainly will be going back soon."}
{"text":"Probably the best viet restaurant I have been to in Toronto.  You can taste that the place is actually run by viet owners.  There is a difference in flavour between this place and your typical viet place in TO.

Friendly staff, clean, and legit."}
{"text":"Before I can here, I've always heard my BF tel me how amazing the pho is at Pho Metro but at the Lawrence location. So when he heard there was one in Markham, he suggested that we go for lunch. I agreed and off we headed towards Pho Metro!

Upon arrival we were told we can seat ourselves so we did and the waiter promptly gave us tea. We ordered the fresh roll with shrimp and pork. It was really \"fresh\" as the name implies! I devoured an entire roll immediately! It was so good! Our special pho arrived as well and it smelled divine! The soup base was flavourful! I was pleasantly surprised by how flavourful it was! I am now in agreement with my BF that Pho Metro is the best! The portion of noodles given in the small bowl was more than enough. The beef, beef brisket, tripe and tendon were so good! I'm salivating until I can come back again!! I love pho so much!!!

Service was friendly and fast! Speed is everything when you come on hangry"}
{"text":"I am so happy that there is a Pho Metro in Markham area now.
Place was near empty on a Saturday evening but I'm guessing during the weekdays its slammed because of the high school which is nearby. Service was excellent and super friendly. I have never had better service in a Vietnamese restaurant. We also got 10% off the bill as they are still running their grand opening special which should be ending soon. 

Ice coffee with condensed milk $3.99 - tasted great but a bit small with a lot of ice.
Vermicelli house special $11.50 - comes with grilled pork and deep fried spring roll. Large portion of meat with a fresh serving of veggies and noodles. The spring roll itself was nice and crispy but instead of being filled with so much noodles I would rather it be filled with more meat."}
{"text":"Located in a plaza off Buroak, this is our favourite place to get bun combos. 

The house special is a generous portion of meat, veg, vermicelli noodles and spring rolls as well as shrimp. 

We also got the rice paper rolls which were deliciously fresh. Excellent service with really friendly staff; food comes out really quick, which is great because as soon you enter the delicious smells makes you eager for your food to come!

Prices are extremely reasonable."}
{"text":"This is one of my go-to places to eat in Toronto. I am here at least once a week. Everything on the menu can become a favorite. If you are into drinks, like bubble tea, vietnamese coffee, or even a good smoothie (avocado, lychee ...) this place is great. They have a points system too that gets you free extras with your meal like spring rolls, smoothies, pop etc."}
{"text":"Pho is pretty good for north Markham.  Soup base is good and pricing is decent.  Good enough to return to if you live nearby.  Definitely better pho places further south, but I would say not great, but not bad."}
{"text":"I have been a long time customer of this place.  Mostly because it's close to my work place and the food is great.  It's always consistently good, no matter what you order. I am the usual creature of habit and always order one of about 6 things on the menu.  Each one always satisfies my craving.  Great and friendly service and totally perfect for a quick lunch away from the office.  Just get there early or you'll have to line up!  I totally recommend this place for Pho/Viet food lunch or dinner.  Can't go wrong with Pho Metro."}
{"text":"I loveeeee this place! Oh man the staff are super friendly and kind! The noodles are so bomb oh man. The smoothies *drools*.

So this place is somewhat new to Markham maybe 1-4 months now I think... I could be wrong. This places pho is fantastic! I really love the noodles and the meat here! It's got that nice chew feeling when you eat a noodle!

The smoothies oh man.. I don't even know where to start! The avocado is so nice and smooth! You can actually taste the avocado more then the cream! The mango smoothie is amazing! You can taste the sweetness of the mango and the sourness of it and wow it sure packs a punch! Definitely order this drink from now on! The parking lot is shared by lot of other small restaurants, but there is lots so don't worry!"}
{"text":"Good food, quick service, but it can get very cramped when busy.

Staff: Food comes out quick, nothing else noteworthy.

Ambience: This place is decently sized, but there tends to be crowds at random times. In addition, with people doing take out and paying at the cash, it can get really cramped. The parking lot can be a nightmare when it's busy, especially if you drive a van like I do, since the lot is small.

Food: The broth is good, the pho is good, the meat is good. The beef balls could be slightly bigger. I do feel that the larger bowl sizes equate a lot more broth than noodles. I do enjoy the spring rolls, but they are skinnier and longer than I am used to at other restaurants. The price is on par (if not slightly higher) than other pho places, but they have a bit of a monopoly of the area, so it is to be expected.

I keep coming back to this place, so I must like it right?"}

Their service is really quick and fast and their food is quite good as well.  Their spring rolls are nice and crisp and their bun (vermicelli salads) are quite good and packed full of goods all the time.  Their pho broth is also quite delicious and the ultimate comfort food for all occasions. Overall this is my favourite pho place in Markham :)"}

I'm gonna unfortunately say this place isn't 4 stars compared to some of the reviews I'm seeing here.

This restaurant is the same branch as the Pho Metro in Scarborough, but the menus are different. There's a couple more options here compared to the Scarborough branch, which honestly makes sense considering the abundance of Vietnamese restaurants in Markham.

I ordered the Vietnamese beef stew noodle soup, while my dad ordered the rice noodle soup with chicken and satay sauce. My dad's bowl arrived first, and I would like to warn you if you try this bowl...the satay sauce is SPICY. My dad is very tolerant of spicy food and even he got taken aback to the point he had to ask for a cup of ice. The chicken is white meat and quite healthy, but the broth otherwise is nothing special.

My Vietnamese beef stew had a delicious broth, but there wasn't enough in it. The rice noodles were clumped together, so I had to bring it up several times in order to spread out the noodles. Unfortunately the noodles absorbed the broth quite fast, so I only barely managed to finish it. The beef stew was delicious, and the mashed potatoes were a good addition to create that unique broth taste.

Service was excellent and the waiter managed to explain the contents of some of the menu items quite well. However I would not be rushing to return here, as there are better Vietnamese noodle places in Markham."}
{"text":"3.5/5, +.5 for service

My standards were set quite high for this place due to the high ratings and positive praise from many of my foodie friends.

The restaurant was busy for a Wednesday afternoon, which was an encouraging sign. Thankfully I was set down quite fast and was given the menu on the spot. Seeing how the place was busy, I wanted to quickly order my food so I can leave to allow the next customers in.

I ordered the bo kho, which is the Vietnamese beef stew rice noodle soup. Note that this particular bowl takes longer than your regular pho, as the broth is different and beef stew takes a while to make. Regardless, I liked the fact the employees kept checking the kitchen to make sure my food was still being made.

As for the food itself, it was very good, but I still liked Kim Po's better. With this noodle soup I generally prefer the wider noodles, as it's not technically \"pho\", and Kim Po provides that. That being said, the broth here is great, and the beef stew wasn't too tough but also not to the point it literally breaks apart from grabbing it with your chopsticks.

Pho Metro is probably in my top 5 list of favourite Vietnamese noodle soup restaurants in the GTA. It's definitely not #1 in my books, but it's a place I can rely on if I'm ever in the area."}
{"text":"Disappointed..the Scarborough location is so good even if it's much smaller, but the food just isn't the same. They cut corners and you have the ask for everything.....like where are my bean sprouts for my pho? Can I have the some peanuts? The spring rolls aren't  nearly as good as the Scarborough location either. They would greatly benefit from,  following what
the Scarborough location does with at least a lunch special to get more people in there."}
{"text":"I first found out about this place on yelp just to see what is close by in markham. Out comes pho metro probably one of the best pho I have ever had in my life. We had spicy beef pho and mix the hosin  and siracha and all the basil and mints condiments the pho taste like heaven. I just wanted to keep eating it after the first bite or sip lol. This beats any pho place hands down."}
{"text":"The ordinary exterior would not have enticed me to walk in had I not been dragged in by my friend.

My friend is Vietnamese-Canadian and swears by their pho, that this location is one of his top 3 favorite spots to go for authentic food when his mom doesn't feel like cooking.

I ordered a small grilled pork in rice paper roll for $5 and the chicken,  pork chop and fried egg on rice for $10.95.  The rice rolls were so good I asked the server to change to a large order so I get double the amount for $9. The chicken and pork chip were also nicely flavored and came at a generous portion.

Service was not mind blowing but they were pleasant and just friendly and accommodating enough. I will be coming here frequently."}
{"text":"A small pho place close to home. Very busy place. Although serving is small, every taste is so delectable. Beef balls i I think its home made, it is very tasty. All the meat they put in your pho is tender and delicious. I ordered the house special grilled meat and aurprise onnthe small.portion of each kind of meat but every bite let me enjoy the flavors.

Staff are very nice. Will come back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Great pho, by far my most favourite place that opened in that spot in recent years...everything doesn't seem to last.
Soup is flavourful and fragrant. Their rare beef usually comes a touch on the over done end, but the brisket and tripe is really nice.
I also like their grilled meats on vermicelli.
Portions are great, a small pho will fill me happily. A large is a meal for sumo wrestlers.
Best pho in the area! Simple and comforting food :)"}

5/5 stars"}
{"text":"One of my favourite places for pho in Toronto.  The prices have gone up over the last year but it's still got good quality food.  Friendly service, quick and clean, that automatically brings it a notch higher than other Vietnamese places.

My standard orders:
deep fried spring rolls - so good!  I always order them

Pho with assorted beef - classic with a very tasty broth.  I'm not a huge fan of the beef balls that they have but it is better than other places.  I find that in general the beef balls in Toronto are smaller than the ones in Vancouver, which are larger and have tendon/ligaments in it which are delicious!

Spicy Beef Pho (Bun Bo Hue) - nice and spicy.  It's always a toss up between that and the regular pho menu.

Seafood pho (clear noodle) - good if you want something a bit different, especially with the chewy thick clear noodle, but want the nice clear broth and have some seafood as well.

I've had some of their rice dishes which are okay but really it's the pho and spring rolls that shine here."}
{"text":"Pho Metro originally started in a strip mall in Scarborough but has franchised to a couple of other locations including this one in Markham.

We've always liked the one in Scarborough and came with the family to this one evening and I have to say the food is very consistent with the original.

As I always do when I go to a new pho place for the first time, I ordered the pho special with rare beef, tripe, meatballs and tendon with the thin flat noodles.  This pho here is very flavourful, noodles firm and with a good amount of meat to noodle soup ratio.

Another thing thing that they make really well here is the Bun Bo Hue or Spicy Noodle Soup.  The flavours for this is excellent and deep.

The kids enjoyed their grilled chicken with rice combo and satay noodles as well.  The only thing I don't like from them is the fried spring rolls which tastes great but on the tiny side:(

Staff is very nice and attentive and the restaurant is very clean.

Overall a great option as there's not a lot of good Vietnamese places around this part of Markham.  

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"After reading other yelp reviews, i had been trying to come here forever.

Finally had the chance!!

Came here on a weeknight.  Parking was fine, ample spaces everywhere.
Got greeted and seated, so far so good.

Ordered the House PHo special, and other dishes. The young waiter was friendly.

Things turned worse from here on.
We asked for 2glasses of water, it never came, we had to ask again.
Food came one at a time...
My Pho was.. ok, not great, not good. Lots of noodles, little brisket, or tendon. broth was.. ok
Wife was not impressed with her order.  Kids didn't finish their meal.

I asked for the bill, and waited almost 10mins. i had to assume he forgot, so i had to walk up and pay at the counter.

Wife says, we are going to stick to our regular pho place.

So.. it wasn't a good experience. A bit disappointed especially at the service from the guy i asked for the bill.

I had higher expectations from reading all the reviews.

2 stars for this experience."}

{"text":"This is by far the best pho place I've been to. They are generous (except the fried banana dessert where there's not enough ice cream) with their portions and the prices are very reasonable. 

I go strictly for the pho. They put a lot of meat in their pho and the broth is amazing. Not enough choices for vegetarians though. 

The place is quite small and usually packed with customers. This means parking can be tricky. This is not the ideal place for a nice quiet date. This is a great place for a casual get together. All in all its clean and so are the washrooms most of the time."}
{"text":"Probably the best non home cooked Vietnamese dishes I've had in the GTA! Their Bun Ho Hue, Hu Tieu My Tho, Com Dac Biet and Pho are spot on - the epitome of comfort food! Their meet and broths taste so fresh and yumssss. Their fried spring rolls are just okay - I would skip it. 

Service is fast and great. The prices are the norm so really, no complaints! Definitely a must try :)"}
{"text":"Always busy and always consistent with the quality. I always go there for grilled chicken vermicelli bowl. But then again that's really hard for any Vietnamese place to screw up."}
{"text":"I've been to many Pho restaurants throughout the GTA, Grand River, an Durham region and I would have to say that Pho Metro is one of the best in Durham, but definitely mediocre in comparison to many in GTA and Grand River.

Food: 3/5
I ordered their Vermicelli dish (see picture). The noodles were quite dry and the sauce they provided me with lacked flavour. The sugar cane shrimp was very flavourful, however it was unfortunate that it could be consumed in 1-2 bites. The spring roll was delicious and was not oily (a plus considering many Thai spring rolls I order are usually drenched in oil!). The proportion from noodles to meat was quite high - wish there was more shrimp or more pork 

I also ordered a red bean smoothie. It felt more like a melted down smoothie than a viscous smoothie itself, unfortunately. I've ordered red bean smoothies from them in the past that were better.

Service: 3/5 
I've been to the restaurant plenty of times and the waiters/waitresses have been quite friendly. This particular visit, however, the waiter forgot Pho side dishes (lime, leaves, etc) for my partner as well as presenting our food at different times. 

Environment: 4/5
This location is tucked into the edge of Ajax (Salem/Steeles) and is rarely ever too crowded. The eating area and washroom is generally clean. Good place to eat with families for sure.

Price: 4/5

Overall 3.5/5

One thing to note is that they take Vicinity cards. That means you can earn a free pop or smoothie after spending a certain amount at their restaurant :)"}
{"text":"For the price and quality, I definitely recommend the pho here. The soup flavour is much better than most without feeling very salty. Portion size is reasonable, but not huge by any means. 

Pho 88 used to be my go to place but this is definitely up a notch. Plus it did not have that weird smell when I walked in. This will be my next go to place for pho."}

{"text":"Went pho hunting one day, as I was craving some delicious viet food, so I went to the normal viet restaurant. I then decided to consult my trusty yelp companions and found this restaurant. 

To start off, the atmosphere is quite nice, quiet and clean. A very nice ambiance to enjoy a bowl of pho and relax. 

The taste is also amazing. To start off, the broth was rich and had a beefy taste, rather then a mouth full of msg. The raw beef was tender and not overcooked. The viet coffee, probably one of my all time favourite drink, was rich and strong. The initial sip sends a flavour as strong as a punch from Mike Tyson. 

The service is steady and the servers are nice and we'll mannered. They serve with a smile and respect, and that is something I find very important.

All in all, this place is really good. Probably one of the better viet restaurants found in Markham and is highly comparable to the ones found in downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"Nice food.. OK service ...
Had the Veg Pad Thai/ fresh Spring Rolls and the pork/Chicken with Rice and Spring rolls + the Avocado Milkshake! 

Might come back if in the area... wont make it a point to make the trip."}
{"text":"Ordered the Pho Dac Biet (my standard for trying any new place) and a Grilled Beef Vermicelli. 

Pho was solid, good broth, good meats and toppings. Will definitely order again. 

Grilled Beef was very good! Sliced thin but soft, not burnt and very tasty. 

Price and portion like everyone said, it's a bit pricey compared to others and portion a bit on the small end, however not a big deal. Also, decor is nice and simple but there's no background music so a tad quiet. 

Will eat here again!"}
{"text":"Nothing in this plaza amuses me so when pho metro opened I didn't pay special attention to this place. Yelp then recommended me to eat here. Within the week I came here at least three times. This is definitely my new favourite pho place in Markham currently. The medium size pho portion is just perfect. I just find that 4 spring rolls for $9 is quite pricey. The pho is probably 1$ more expensive than other pho places but I find that it's certainly worth the money. I am also addicted to their mango smoothie. The Vietnamese ice coffee with condensed milk was not the best. I had better Vietnamese coffees in order locations but it's also worth the try. The customer service is also on par. Seating is very comfortable. I enjoy setting the table myself so it's nice to have chopsticks and condiments on the side to help yourself."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 4 stars because it's my first time. I have to say, this is the best Viet restaurant in the east end. 
I found Pho Metro on Yelp with 4.5 stars, that's why we decided to give it a try. 
The prices are a little higher than your typical but the portions are also bigger. The restaurant is decent, big bathrooms and clean.
I will definitely come back the next time I want a Viet dish in the east end. 
We had pho tai nam, bun rieu, fried spring rolls, pork/shrimp rolls, com dish, bun dish, mango salad, & mango shakes. 
There were 4 of us."}
{"text":"Been coming here since they opened. We love the soup here. The broth of full bodied and delicious. Service is great and the owners are super friendly."}
{"text":"Very average and pho is not so big. You would think that a small for $8.15, Med for $9.15 and large for $10.15 were prices that would get you a rather larger bowl of pho. But in reality, I would have rather driven to Scarborough. We read a food blog suggesting to dine here and was it ever an oversell.

Broth was OK. Noodles were OK. But seriously, the special pho was just really short on meat. You get paper thin slices of lean meat along with maybe 2-3 beef balls the size of a quarter. I barely had tripe in mine and maybe got a few more onions. 

This was like the skinny sandwich version of pho. I was thoroughly disappointed. Don't expect your regular portions here."}
{"text":"decent place, service is top notch as the servers looks to serve you fast.  tables are evenly spread out.  Food is kind of average and expensive for the portion size you get.  But the best thing was the service, family run business that actually cares about the business and customers."}
{"text":"Pho Metro is our go-to place in Toronto for Vietnamese food. The pho is amazingly good - rich broth that's not too salty and the meat portion is huge compared to the pho places downtown. My parents rave about the quality of the meatballs. We bring our kids (infant and toddler) there and the staff are happy to see them. Great environment and great staff. Really happy they expanded and added banh mi to the menu too."}
{"text":"We were in this area for a baseball game and was told to check out pho metro. So glad we did. This place did not disappoint.  We ordered Bun Rieu and their special vermicelli and both were delicious! Not too many restaurants can make bun Rieu well but pho metro got it bang on.  The broth was very tasty and the crab paste meat balls were sooooo good. There were plenty of meat for you meat lovers out there. 

I will definitely come back here next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"We love this place and have become regular customers. It's clean, friendly and satisfies that craving for a hot bowl of soup noodles. Their stir fry options are quite good as well, especially the pad Thai. 

What my husband and I appreciate most about this place is their service. They are fast, but not pushy. They also own up to their mistakes (which rarely happens). One time, they forgot my hot drip coffee. I was done my meal and it still hadn't come, so I asked to cancel it. Instead, they gave the coffee to me in a take away cup and said it was on the house. Although a small gesture, I think this is a prime example of business done right."}
{"text":"I have been looking for decent pho in the area and saw a Groupon for this new location in Ajax. I can't compare it to the Toronto location(s), but I thought it was great. Very clean, very quiet, not huge but a lot of options for moving tables for large parties while retaining some intimate corners.

Tables are stocked with extra chopsticks, sriracha/fish sauce/soy/chili etc., which is very convenient. I took my 5-year old; we tried the special vermicelli and a Pho Tai (medium). The portions are HUGE; my daughter ate some of my noodles and I still had enough for myself PLUS leftovers. All the meats were good (not a fan of shrimp on sugarcane, I learned) and temps were perfect. Hot tea is complimentary; I also got a mango bubble tea (like a smoothie, I prefer milk-based normally but it was good).

Service was a little slow, but I think they expect you to flag them down when they're needed. They give you menus and a little notepad to write down what you want (menu #, how many etc.), but are very friendly when asked questions; for example, they bring a fish sauce mix with the food, which is slightly different than the straight sauce in the bottle on the table.

I've had pho in a number of other locations (Raleigh, Boston etc.) and this was the best I've had. I like that it's close to Whitby. I asked if they did delivery; they are trying to get it set up, but they're pretty new, so it's not available yet.

We will definitely go back! Lots of parking (Metro strip mall, in between a Subway and a little bakery that is also really nice), easy to get to."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today. Great quality and tasting food for the price and I just got back from Vietnam. Great friendly staff too!!"}
{"text":"Pho Metro stands out in a place like Ajax, a town of mostly 2/5 and 3/5 star restaurants with few hidden gems. I've come here at least 30 times since they've opened doors. I'd actually rate them 3.5/5 but would round up to 4 for the location.

Restaurant is usually very clean, including plates and cutlery. Depending on busyness, servers may be more or less attentive when they're juggling so much customers at once but are always very nice.

The food itself is amazing at most but just average at worst. It really depends on the visit.

Pho/noodle soup - ordered rare beef today. Broth was light, less tasty and hearty than usual. Usually I get the perfect amount of noodles... today there was less than usual.

Deep fried springrolls - oh my. Perfectly deep fried, golden with a thick, crunchy shell. Dipped in fish sauce, it is salty and yummy and everything I want in a springroll. Theirs is one of the best among dozens of Vietnamese restaurants I've been to across GTA - a must order! HIGHLY recommend."}
{"text":"The Pho here is good, but not incredible. I am not sure if it is the same owners as the previous Despite the food at Xe Lua not being so good, I was sad to see them move from their location at Kennedy. I always went there so it was somewhat sentimental. Anyways, Pho Metro will do as a replacement! 

First I will go over the Positives. Firstly, it is a newer restaurant so the inside is pretty nice. Most of the vietnamese restaurants I have visited were a little bit more \"run down\" in nature. The second thing I really liked is that they don't add cilantro into their soup. I HATE cilantro so its really annoying for me when I forget to request \"no cilantro\". I spend like 5 minutes picking it all out! LOL. Third, the table was set out really well. Chopsticks, spoons, napkins, condiments and condiment bowls- everything you need is there for you in large quantities. That way, if you drop a chopstick or need another napkin, you can easily grab one! Lastly, the beed and noodles in the soup were very good. The noodles were not overcooked and the beef was tender. 

Now the negatives of Pho Metro. Firstly, the pho broth is not overly salty which is great for me, but in fact it is little bit too under-seasoned as it tastes much like a bland stock. Another negative is that there is no beef tendon available in the soups! I usually make sure to include everything- tendon, tripe, flank etc. so this was a little bit disappointing. I had also tried the rice paper rolls, but they were not that great for me. If you are not a fan of mint like me, you will not like these. Next time I visit, ill be sure to let them know. 

For me, the flavour of the food is of paramount importance. It is only fair that I give 3 stars because of the experience.  Essentially, the ratings on yelp do not correlate with the experience that I had here. Although there were great attributes, they mostly lay in the quality of service and comfort. Unfortunately, the food that I tried just wasn't incredible- good, but not incredible."}
{"text":"The first time I visited Pho Metro was half a year ago. I decided to give this restaurant a return visit, which isn't too far away from home.

Back then, I walked in for lunch. The place was half full. I ordered the grilled chicken vermicelli with a crispy spring roll. I also got fresh rolls with beef in them. I was happy with how flavourful and fresh everything was.

Six months ago, I recall paying using direct deposit. All was good.

I returned last weekend. Things have changed as far as card payments go. Your bill has to be at least $20 to be able to use your debit or credit card. I suppose that the restaurant is cutting down on charges that it incurs.

I was there at 3 pm on Saturday for a late lunch. I ordered the grilled chicken vermicelli again. It was so good the first time that I went for it again. The chicken was flavourful and the fish and vinegar sauce was perfect. 

This time, I ordered pork and shrimp fresh rolls to start. Again, the ingredients were vibrant and fresh. So yummy!

I realized that my meal was only at $15. I decided to order some crispy chicken wings to go. They boxed them up nicely. I was pleasantly surprised that I got seven wings. Normally, you get six wings when you order a small portion. I ate them at home a few hours later. They were delicious! The sauce on them made them so tasty.

The serving staff are polite and helpful. They truly seem happy to be there.

My bill total was $24 with tax. I paid with my debit card. All was well. Otherwise, I would have had to look for an ATM somewhere to get some cash.

I like it here. I need to return more often. I will try the pho and see how that goes.

The pho comes first. I get an immediate facial. It smells fragrant and yummy. The spring rolls come next. 

I start with the appetizer, which comes with a dipping sauce with pickled carrot slivers and big chunks of peanuts. The spring rolls are delicious! The grilled chicken is to die for. The best ones I have had for years.

Special Rice Noodle Soup (Small) - $7.25: comes with rare beef, beef balls, beef flank, and beef tripe. The broth was too bland. I needed a lot of sauce to enhance the flavour. Rare beef and beef flank were dry, beef balls had the right amount of chewiness, but beef tripe was too chewy and rubbery. On the bright side, the noodles were good because they were firm.

Overall, this is just an average spot for Pho. Unfortunately, I would not recommend this place for the Special Rice Noodle Soup. The biggest drawbacks were the meat quality and lack of flavour in their soup."}
{"text":"Is Markham Pho standards different than the ones in Vaughan and Richmond Hill? Have I been spoiled or just lucky, as this place had good ratings from Yelp friends so I wanted to give it a try on a cold winter day. 

Fresh herb & veggie side:
2 lime wedges, bean sprouts, and branch of Thai basil this is the minimum but it was all fresh. 

Avocado milk shake: $4.75! For a tall sized Starbucks to go cup, more milk than fruit. Still tasty but not like other places where you can turn your cup upside down, the thickness and richness wasn't there. 

Tom yum seafood noodles:
A sweeter spice missing the other elements of heat and fish sauce but very flavorful and tasty nevertheless. Fish balls somehow tasted dried inside, never had that before but I'm not sick the next day so dunno what happened there, shrimp a tad over cooked but noodles were good.

Pho special:
Broth very tasty and flavorful, meat was more medium than rare, soft enough and comparable.  

The ambience on a weekday lunch was very sad, very dim lighting, no music, just background noise of clanking China and chopsticks, slurping of noodles and cp24 on the tv.  The vibe could have been easily changed with some background music and better lighting.

Yummy broth!!!  Small order of shrimp & pork salad roll, mango salad...that one is a must.  Heaping serving of fresh and yummy flavoured mango and veggies!  We will be back.

{"text":"Honestly, in comparison to every other viet store around, this is as good as it gets.  There's a huge parking lot so getting a spot isn't usually a hassle. I've only ever seen this place half full at the most so you'll always get a seat.

The pho here is pretty amazing.  The soup doesn't water down after you add sprouts and I love it with sriracha. The menu is pretty extensive including all the staples of spring rolls, vermicelli, broken rice, and pho.  They also accept Vicinity so you can collect points :) 

Only downside is the cleaning bleach they use when customers are eating.  Completely destroys my tastebuds."}
{"text":"Pho Metro is definitely one of those little hidden gems tucked away in an unassuming plaza.

The parking does get tricky as the restaurant shares the lot with several other stores including a shisha bar and a Little Caesars.

Walking in - the restaurant was a happy green and acceptably clean.  The utensils on the side do seem like they've been thoroughly washed and none of them were sticky :) 

The pho seems like one of the only soups in Toronto that holds the flavour after a handful of bean sprouts. There was lots of beef but I wish there were more noodles ):

The spring rolls were crisp and super oily but too expensive at $4.50 for a small.

My boyfriend ordered his usual chicken and pork + egg rice - he devoured it and said it tasted great but wished there was more for the price paid.

Overall the food here is great, the service is excellent, but the price to portion ration was slightly off."}

This is a great place for Vietnamese food.  The pho is the best in Markham.  The spring roll is nice and crispy and it has taro !! I have not had spring roll for a while in Markham.  We usually have pho and pork chop rice.  The size is very good and I love the pho noodle soup is very hot!  Service is excellent !!!! Must try in Markham!!!"}
{"text":"Had a heart warming feel good bowl of Special Beef Pho followed with fresh made Chicken Rice Paper Rolls. My small bowl of Pho noodles was soft with appealing meat in it. More importantly the Broth; it was clear and tantalize to the palate.  The service crew was friendly and efficient even in its infancy days of opening."}
{"text":"I came here for some take out during \"lunch\" and was surprised to see that the restaurant was quite packed even at 3pm (especially since this plaza never gets too busy). 

I ordered the grilled chicken, pork, and spring rolls with vermicelli and vegetables and it was ready in about 5 minutes! So fast! 

It smelled delicious on my car ride home and I was happy to see my take out box was packed with both meats, veggies, and plenty of their fish sauce. It was also delicious too! Chicken and pork were very well seasoned and were meaty and juicy. The spring rolls could have been a little more crunchy for me, but I'm assuming it was softened because it was in the take out box for a little too long. Vermicelli was also plentiful and good. I feel the price was reasonable for its proportion."}
{"text":"Their food wasn't that great but I guess their lunch deals are pretty reasonable. Their mango shake is too sweet for my taste."}
{"text":"Surprisingly the food here is quite decent.

House Special Beef Noodles ($7.95 for a small)
Comes with rare beef, beef brisket, beef balls, and beef tripe - all pieces of the beef which I like. Normally places come with beef tendons which I don't like so glad it wasn't included. There was actually quite a lot of meat pieces, and a lot of noodles as well. The rice noodles were super thin, soft and slightly chewy which was really good. The meets were soft, beef brisket didn't have much fat with it either. The beef balls were nice and bouncy. The soup base was good, I thought it tasted slightly bland though. One thing I noticed was there seems to be little MSG as I didn't feel super thirsty after finishing it.

House Special Vermicelli ($11.25)
This dish was really big! Grilled beef, grilled pork, shrimp paste on a stick, Vietnamese spring rolls, with vermicelli and veggies on the side The dish comes with fish sauce which you pour to mix with your vermicelli to add flavor and bring down the grease from the grilled meat. There was a decent amount of meat and veggies, I actually wouldn't minded more vermicelli. The vermicelli was thin and soft. The grilled pork tasted better than the beef. The spring rolls were thinner than usual, nice and crispy."}
{"text":"I love this place! The vegetarian pad thai and the rice noodle soup is my favourite. If you like tofu, you have to try their fried tofu - they serve it with this spicy red sauce and its the best! The place is nice and modern and very clean. The service can use some improvement but the food is just to good to skip out on this place."}
{"text":"We went for dinner the other day, it's not a bad place. Nice and big seating area, the service was fairly fast which we liked. The food didn't take forever to be served. Which is a plus. The food tasted good. I loved my chicken pho soup, everything was fresh and yummy and the chicken pad Thai was also very tasty.  They just neglected to bring enough bowls and plates for our family to share. As well as tea cups. The portions are OK.  Not too big. We had to order an additional fried rice ( which wasnt very impressive, just average) because we were not full!  Price wise I think it can be a bit cheaper. I thought it was above average by a dollar or two. Considering their portions.  So overall I think it's a good place for quick meal."}
{"text":"Solid 3 star Viet restaurant. We checked it out for lunch today after seeing it on Yelp. Small place with line and wait of about 15-20 mins for 4 ppl on a Sunday afternoon.  I do feel bad bc it seems like the workers were rushing their patrons to get us to a table. Once we sat down it was fine. Their Bánh Hoi Thit nuong nem nuong Cha gio and it was pretty good, com Suon ga nuong Thit nuong opla also good and my mom had bun bo hue. Everything a little bland but it's okay, guess it can suit many ppl. I had the bun rieu, crab soup, and it was not good. Viet ice coffee is good and their young coconut water with pulp is regular like any other restaurant. Skip the can sugarcane juice - does not taste like fresh sugarcane juice. We would try their pho if we are in the area but won't come here just to eat. Apparently they are expanding to make a Bánh Mi Metro soon."}
{"text":"I have only been once but I'll definitely go back. The service was very friendly and the Pho is really nice. I had the rare beef which had lots of meat which was nice and tender. You can tell they use quality ingredients."}
{"text":"quite a good pho restaurant. although i normally don't eat pho at pho places. (home cooked just blows restaurant pho out the water). so usually i'll order rice with pork/chicken and an egg fried sunny side up. the meat was very marinated, though i felt that the pork and chicken were marinated with the same stuff. would've liked different flavours.

what i like about pho metro though, is that the ingredients taste fresh. i feel like im eating good quality stuff there. so thats a thumbs up in my books."}
{"text":"the thing that stood out to me about this pho shop, was the quality of the ingredients. you could really taste that it was a higher grade quality, and the meat was seasoned very well too.

oh, btw. i ordered. grilled chicken, fried, egg and rice.

i also ordered a mango smoothie because they were out of the avocado. i only realised when i got the drink that it was a smoothie and not a milkshake. was a bit disappointed about that. it was a good smoothie. i just really wanted a milkshake, that's all."}
{"text":"This is a tentative review, as I was sick when I agree here today. Giving this place a confirmed review the next time I come here.

Went to this Pho Metro for dinner, but wasn't sure if it was affiliated with the one on Lawrence Ave East. Staff are on the quiet side (probably because it was close to closing time) but are very friendly.

I ordered the P2 (Pho Tai, rare beef pho), medium size. The portion size is average, normally what you get anywhere else. The soup itself, for some reason, tasted a bit too salty, like it was left for too long. This is where I figured I needed to visit a second time - to see if it was my sickness that changed the profile, or if it was actually the restaurant itself.

I would imagine it was me, given I loved the Pho Metro at their other location."}
{"text":"This Pho Metro location is miles better than the one up in Markham. Honestly though, it's always the OG location that makes the food the best. Run by ACTUAL Vietnamese Canadians, you know you're getting the real deal here.

The soup is phenomenal. Just the right amount of saltiness. Do yourself a favour and always try the soup before you dump anything else in. The cleanliness of that soup really stands out to me. One thing that bugs me (but really isn't a big deal) is when the noodles are clumped together in a ball and you're forced to break it apart. None of that here. None.

The meat selection here is just a tad off from making this bowl of pho perfection but I can't really give it anything lower than a 5 star here.

The servers are really nice if you get to know them a little bit. Just their personalities alone make me want to come back for more.

Oh, and they've expanded and beat that dead-ass store to the right to sell... BANH MI. That's right.

Come early. Come during off hours. The place may be a bit small, but I wouldn't want to stand there waiting and smelling that amazing aroma."}
{"text":"Considering it's in Durham it's great. I had the Pho special with a noodle dish with mixed proteins. In terms of the size it's pretty standard and I think it's a great place for people to sit and catch up. In terms of service, I did enjoy the self serve style. I know that many people might not like it but you get to sit where ever you want and leave when you want to since you just pay up front. In terms of food, the Pho broth was great, it could have been a bit stronger but when I came it to the Pho train in downtown toronto it was better. I'd say the broth might be a bit better than Pho Hung so if you're looking for a good Viet place in Durham I'd say this is better than Pho Saigon in Pickering."}
{"text":"I emailed this feedback to Pho Metro on September 26, 2017. No response. That evening from around 9-9:30pm this evening. We ordered P3/P7medium and A1/A13large. The young Asian girl with glasses took our order. She mentioned twice that the order was a lot. We said, anything extra we'd pack to go. 

When the order was being served, we received 4x pho soups. We said we ordered P3 and P7 medium soups only and the other two were appetizers. She said out loud, \"well, this is really your fault\". We advised her that you cannot tell your customers they're at fault cause you couldn't read the order. Everybody was looking/listening in. 

We told her to cancel the 2 appetizers if it's not being made yet. She said the orders will be served shortly. 25mins later, our apps didn't arrive. The kitchen staff kept yelling and looking at our table. It was very obvious that they were upset by purposely not making the 2 appetizers. We've been in the restaurant industry and it's nothing we haven't seen before. Out of spite!

Instead of containing the problem with just one person, the complaint now is towards the kitchen staff as well. If the owners were there, none of this poor attitude would happen. 

Food is great and that's why we we've continued support since they opened. Now we're off in search for a better spot."}
{"text":"10/10 best pho and great appetizers. Came here twice with my friends and was not disappointed. Also, very friendly staff. :)"}
{"text":"This place was great! I like it when they went bare bones and put their heart straight into their food.  I had the rare beef pho and their fried tofu. Simple and tasty and I didn't feel thirsty after like a lot of other pho places that I've been to."}
{"text":"M favourite pho place. 

I live in vaughan so its pretty out of the way, but I will still make the trek here just for a bowl of their yummy noodles, as they surpass all the other phos near me or along the way. 

I find the place clean and service efficient and although not overly friendly (like any pho) they are competent and on the ball. Really good broth and noodles, and the meat portion is not stingy and always tastes fresh and good cuts (not too fatty or grizzly). They also do their spring rolls right.

Only con is parking lot isn't that big and can be pretty full, but I've always managed to get a spot soon enough."}
{"text":"Good:
1. Bun Bo Hue - Love it!  The noodles, the flavours, and everything in it are all great.  Must get if you like spicy.

Bad:
1. Tepid soup - Do not get rare meats for the pho because the soup comes out lukewarm and the meat doesn't get cooked.  Disappointing.

Neutral:
1. Lemongrass pork/chicken rice - It's average, pieces of meat are too thin and not quite substantial enough.

Worth it?: Yes, prices are reasonable and probably one of the better pho places in the area."}
{"text":"Decent pho and rice platter. Wish pho broth was bit less greasy. You can see so much fat floating on the broth. I could see it tasting much better if it was less greasy and had some sliced onions. I would return if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Was excellent. The beef broth was full of rich bone broth flavour. The vegetarian spring rolls were filled with shredded taro/carrot and more and so delicious and wrapped in the rice paper and fried for the most delicious texture. They give you fish sauce dip on the side which was just perfect to go alongside -- but if you are vegetarian then just omit the dip. 

I ordered H9 (the crab paste, pork, and tofu noodle soup). Was delicious. Pork was meatballs and tasted very homemade. It came with some freshly fried soft tofu, and some sub meat slices on top for garnish. The broth tasted of crab, but there was no crab inside as expected from the menu description."}
{"text":"Arrived around 12:30 on a Sunday and there was still a lineup. They're very fast at turnaround so we didn't have to wait too long as there were lots of people finishing their meals. I tried P1 the house special and an avocado shake. The special was good, and a large is actually quite large for me (I usually order a large if a restaurant only has small and large). At first, I found the avocado shake to only have a mild avocado taste and was wondering why everyone was recommending it. I ended up going to a park afterwards, and I must say that it's a quite refreshing drink when you're out in the sun. Very smooth with a creamy avocado taste. My partner ordered the pork on vermicelli and she kept telling me how delicious it was. I found this place due to its high Yelp review and I believe it deserves its rating."}
{"text":"Always fresh and seasoned just right. Love there spicy noodle soup but really you can go wrong with any item."}
{"text":"Their bun(vermicelli) was delicious, topped with grilled flavorful pork.   Their spring roll was good but not the best. 

Their pho broth was not bad but have had better. 

Service is friendly and quite considerate. We asked for a bowl for our son so he could share our food they brought a bowl and a pair of scissors to help cut the food. We were surprised by that.   

Definitely coming back and will be our go-to Vietnamese place since we live so close."}
{"text":"Pho Metro maybe the most \"authentic\" Pho joint in the immediate area. 

The menu is really simple. I just wish there are more options. The broth has good depth and wonderful aroma from the herbs used. 

I do wish that the beef of my rare beef pho would have stayed rare when it was served to me. But over all their food is consistent as I had been back for a couple of time since it opened.

Great place in the neighbour for a quick pho fix. And the service is always friendly and fast!

A little on the pricey side, especially for vermicelli bowl for $9.25?! And lunch combination for almost $10."}
{"text":"2.5 stars 

The only reason I came to Pho Metro is because I purchase one of those teambuy coupon that gives me $20 for $10. 

The strip mall that Pho Metro located are quite busy... I still remember the days when the Ministry of Health has their health card centre here. We were delighted when we saw designated Pho Metro parking right at the front!! 

Special Beef Rice Noodle ($6.50) M 
- standard Pho, not bad.. 

Vietnamese Spicy Noodle ($6.95) +0.5 star 
- love the varieties of meat in this noodle: beef, Vietnamese sausage, beef brisket and pig blood jello! 
- The noodles are the bun noodle type.. 
- soup is sour and spicy... have great spicy kick 

Rolls with Shrimp and Pork ($3.50) 
- not bad..not something I will order again... 

Three Beans with Coconut Milk ($3.25) 
- I will definitely NO going to order this again... my friend was so excited when she saw the photo in the menu... this big drink with all the colourful beans inside.... 
- And what we got was this little plastic cups... little little cup with little little beans inside...sad and disappointed! 

The portion here are smaller and the price are higher. The deco though is nice, service is good and everything seems to be clean."}
{"text":"I was really craving rare beef noodles but was really tired of all the usual pho restaurants having tough, rubbery meat. So I decided to try Pho Metro and to my surprise it wasn't rubbery at all! Pretty happy with the noodle soup overall - the only thing I would change is make the broth slightly less salty and a bit more flavorful. They also do a yummy avacado shake! Looks like I found my new go-to pho joint. :)"}
{"text":"Best pho in the area. Never disappoints! Try the curry beef brisket pho, get a side of perfectly toasted bread, dip, and thank me later.

So wonderpho, I just wish they stayed open later lol."}
{"text":"My go to place for a pho craving!! The food is consistant everytime I visit and has not let my stomache down!!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here for dinner few days ago on a Wednesday evening. It wasn't crazy busy, but was quite surprised by the amount of people in the middle of the week. 

This would be my 5th or 6th time eating here and had the beef and pork spicy soup(H4) each time. Decided to try something new this visit and had the soup with beef flank, rare beef, and tripe(P7). As always, good broth, good noodle. But I found some of the beef too chewy and couldn't break it down, which was annoying. Probably wouldn't get that again, but will come back for the 6th or 7th!"}
{"text":"It is really hard to find a decent place for pho in Scarborough. There was one in Markham, call Pho Viet at Warden and Steele, but it had recently closed down. It was hard on me because I know it is difficult to search for good pho in the East end. Until I found this place last year, and I immediately fell in love with their pho. When I go there I usually get the \"special pho\", the broth is very delicious and I also notice that all the ingredients are fresh which made everything taste better. I also find their rice dishes to be phenomenal, especially with their lemon grass chicken, it tastes like it was marinated for multiple hours. I highly recommend everyone to go try it out during lunch because they have a lunch special which comes with a main dish, a spring roll and a smoothie. I usually order the mango smoothie because it is blended with real mangos. Some of the people recommend me to try their avocado smoothie as well because it is also very good. There is another Pho Metro in Markham, but it does not taste the same as the one at Warden and Lawrence. One downside at this location is that it always gets packed during lunch, and there will be a line up. On the bright side the wait is well worth it until you try their tasty dishes. Overall, I highly recommend people to try Pho Metro because it is really bombs.

{"text":"I love Pho Metro!!!  

I am SO used to the train head pho place which started off as a student budget-friendly joint but now has degraded to meh-priced meh-quality food. 

Pho Metro? Such a breath of fresh air. Especially since most of the food places in the PET plaza are either dingy or franchises.

Pho Metro is a high quality viet restaurant with excellent service, food, and take-out options. Their menu is fairly simple. They have S, M, L phos, two types of vermicelli, rice options, stir fry options, and typical viet apps like rice rolls and mango salad.

Prices are fair too! A large pho which can adequately feed 2 is $9 ish and there's a good serving of meat, bean sprouts, lime, hoisin sauce, and all that phoey jazz. Broth doesn't seem to have MSG, but I am still a bit skeptical.

I also need to give a huge shoutout to their chicken dishes! Marinated VERY nicely. Anything with the chicken (ie. chicken bun, or chicken rice roll) is really tasty.

4/5! Great stuff but not mindblowingly amazing."}
{"text":"I've never liked Pho before until I tried it at this restaurant. Whenever I go there with my ugly boyfriend, we always order small bowl of pho (Cheaper ^.^) and four fresh chicken and beef rolls. For Pho, I really enjoy their freshly cut beef and tasty broth."}
{"text":"Order: Rice Noodle Soup w/ Chicken & Beef balls 
Cost: $9.25
Verdict: Frigin delicious!!

An absolutely great place for pho and other Vietnamese dishes.  Called in for takeout about 15 to 20 minutes before because this place is usually always busy, and rightfully so! They deserve a lot of praise for being a great go-to place for some authentic and delicious pho. 

The pho broth itself is perfectly seasoned  with so much flavour. Didn't get as many of the beef balls as I would have liked but still a lot of chicken given. 

They have other locations in Ajax and Scarborough as well, so they're pretty easy to find in the GTA. Highly recommended all the pho lovers out there to try this place out!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the meal at Pho Metro a couple nights ago. We ordered the special pho w/ some of the grilled meat sides as well. The noodle soup was a pretty decent size and the soup base was good! What i liked was that I was able to have my pho w/ any sides I could think of.

Really family friendly and a good option for a quick bite in Markham."}
{"text":"Nice spot for some authentic pho. Soup was great, isn't too salty or bland. Had the P1 (tripe, beef balls, rare beef) 

Paid $8.45 for a medium. Service was fast and waiting time was minimal."}
{"text":"My go-to restaurant for authentic Vietnamese food and it's so cheap!! I always come here for the lunch specials (1 spring roll, any drink, and a main dish) I usually either get the bun, pad Thai, or the pho and I'm never disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is not the best Pho restaurant, however, due to limited selection for Viet restaurants in the north end of Markham, this is a decent choice. 
Pho broth is flavourful, however, they use the dry Pho noodles instead of the fresh one which is a bit disappointing. 
Staff seemed friendly. Food arrived quickly. I would come back for Viet cravings as its close by."}
{"text":"One of the best pho's I've had. Ordered a medium rare beef and brisket, came within 5 minutes. Rich complex beef broth with meat all the way down to the end of the bowl. Noodles plentiful too. It's a bit out of the way from my work, though it can be worth the trek. My only personal downside is that it's a busy spot, so line ups will happen through out the day. 

Perfect for getting the chill out of your bones."}
{"text":"I'm a regular here... We eat here atleast once a week. This is One of the better pho restaurants in the Scarb area. It gets super busy around lunch time. Great Pad Thai, you can tell they use quality ingredients. I recommend the Cold rolls and Avocado shake."}
{"text":"Decent pho place hiden in a mediocre plaza. Everything in that plaza was kind of bleh, but I decided to check out Pho Metro since I was looking for something quick and close to home. Ordered the house special the first time,   didn't  expect anything special since house special are normally all the same but I did realize it doesn't seem to have as msg or salt so I wasn't as thirsty.  The second round I ordered the grill chicken with rice. It came out being a little spicy which was surprising since the menu didn't indicate it. Overall the taste of the food wasn't too bad and the price was OK. 

Only complaint was that it was a little on the dirty side."}
{"text":"The place is spacious & the waiters were courteous but the food was just average. Clean place"}
{"text":"It's busy during school hours especially on Fridays. But overall, it's fast and cheap even tho the proportions are not very accurate. The atmosphere is very nice with amazing employees."}
{"text":"Apart from keeping the peanuts in my no-peanut order and almost sending me into an anaphylactic shock (not even joking about this, crisis adverted when my sister realized there were peanuts in it), their food is fairly decent in proportions and quite yummy. 

The noodles in the pad Thai were a little too hard for my liking but the amount of sauce was just right and not too ketchup-y. I think I still prefer their noodle soups though. 

Food aside, their iced coffee with condensed milk is so yummy!! It's definitely a must get. I've also tried their taro smoothie which wasn't nearly as good... The taste was way too sweet and artificial for my liking and I really couldn't finish nor touch it after two sips. 

I've had their rice rolls too, though it's lacking in taste and a little dry, even with the sauce. 

Overall, I'd keep it to the pho. Others aren't excellent enough to get a second time."}
{"text":"Pho Metro has become my go-to pho restaurant. Service is fast and price is fair. Portion size and taste is good too! Only thing I don't like is that a minimum of $20 is needed on your bill to use debit or else there is a charge."}
{"text":"Absolutely my go-to and number 1 pho place in toronto (which has not been de-throned in the almost 4 years I've lived here). Whether you're just ordering pho or their house special vermicelli everything on their menu is top quality and unbeatable! The owner is also very friendly! I'd honestly give this place 10 stars if I could! :)"}
{"text":"TLDR: You need to try this place - generous portions, tasty, quick and easy. 

This is currently my go to place for Vietnamese food if I'm around the area. I really enjoy the selection that they offer. I have tried their pho special, bun bo hue, bun rieu, drip coffee and spring rolls. 

Their phos are very delicious, and full of taste. The potion of their pho is also very generous. I remember coming here for the first time ordering a medium and only finishing half. The second time I ordered a small and it's just right! They are also very generous with the meat! 

Bun no hue was good, decent, but I prefer spicier and more lemongrass! 

Bun rieu, really tasty and highly recommended if you like crab soup (though you don't get a crab, haha). 

Drip coffee, if you like very strong coffee, I recommend that you try it out! 

Spring rolls, unlike other Vietnamese restaurants, their spring rolls are long and skinny - there wasn't much meat inside, instead, there was a lot of taro. 

Overall, really nice place - it's also attached to a banhmi place!!!! Will be back to try other more :)"}
{"text":"Located at the corner Warden/Lawrence, I dropped by for pho on a week day for lunch with my boyfriend. We both ordered a small pho special and it came quickly. The broth was delicious and comforting and there was a vast variety of beef parts. Small is a good size for lunch and the portion was just right. After eating, I was not thirsty due to the little MSG they use. Overall, the location is a bit out of the way for me but would definitely come back for pho if I'm around the area."}
{"text":"When in Scarborough you must try the pho here.  Soup is flavourful and not too salty.  The bun hue is also very good. It can be really busy here so try to come off hours between lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"One of the best phos I've had. I don't have much choices to compare too but that's because I went to one place and didn't enjoy it and never went again. Pho metro has opened up my pallet to trying pho again.   I ordered the chicken satay pho...SO TASTY. I always have to add soy sauce and siriracha to get the taste where I want too...didn't have to this time. This place is awesome...try it! And there's beer :-D"}
{"text":"Small place, but delicious Pho! One of my favourite places to go to for a pho fix. Their pho is very tasty, food comes very quickly too. Their deep friend spring rolls are the best!"}
