{"text":"This has been my neighborhood bar for the last 31 years. Classic Wisconsin fare. Good luck getting a table for a fish fry on Friday.  Having a brandy old fashioned tonight. Life is good."}
{"text":"It's a neighborhood bar, and a really good one.  Cold beers, excellent burgers and brats, and one of the best Friday fish fries in Madison."}
{"text":"Just had my first burger from the 'Crest and let me just say, I can't wait for my next!  If you like stuff that tastes good, then look no further. Oh, you say you're hungry, then you found the place. It's the real deal, not like a tiny Applebee's burger - humongous! Get off the computer and get to this place now! Just do it!"}
{"text":"I can't comment about the food since we left after waiting 1.5 hours without being served.  I can say the service is TERRIBLE.  We asked about our order (4 burgers and fries) after waiting 45 minutes and were told it would be up soon.  30 minutes later and still nothing.  The server argued with us about checking on our order...ummm, you are a server of food and we waited an excess amount of time, at least pretend to do something about.  Don't go here, unless you want to spend an entire afternoon waiting for burgers and fries."}
{"text":"This was my first time at the Oakcrest.  I came here seeking a great burger experience and that is exactly what I got.  Honestly it is the best restaurant burger I've had in quite a while.  I ordered the burger medium and was happy to get medium which is so often not the case at most other places.  I also noticed on the menu their burgers are made from meat procured from Knoche's Butcher Shop.  So if I had to say what made this a great burger I would have to say it was the perfect storm of quality meat and competent food preparation.  Burger toppings and sides are ala cart which is what I prefer.  Service was great.  I will be back."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. I got two hot dogs that were great! The atmosphere could not be beat. The only issue was a older guy in a red hat that worked there. I think was in charge of dishes. He kept staring at my girlfriend..."}
{"text":"Cozy little Tavern Bar.  We went for the Fish Fry after reading it \"is the best ever!\".  While it is good, it isn't the best in Madison.  Since moving to Madison in May I have been on the look out for the best FF in town.  So far Jordan's Big 10 Pub has this place beat.    If you are looking for beers, some chow and a place to hang, this is a good, solid choice.  It is kind of small but they seem to take care of the crowd.  Update:    I've been back a few times now and I stand by my review.  It is just ok.  If you are off work, after 9 and looking for a beer and a burger, and this is on your way home, then stop in.  I had the bacon cheeseburger last night.  The flavor that came out of the burger was from the mustard and ketchup.  I even salted it.    The fish my better 1/2 had was over cooked and dry.   Out waitress was useless....I said hello to her as we walked in, then 10 mins later the bartender asked if we wanted to order food.  I told him we were waiting for a table and said \"is your name on the list\".  I get it, it is busy, it is hot and there is a lot going on.  But if you are in the service industry put on a happy face.     There are a lot of bars in this town and a lot of burgers and fish fry's.  I'll probably be back, but it will be months from now.  No chance this becomes our local spot."}
{"text":"Favorite local bar in Madison. Burgers are amazing. Fish fry is okay but lacking flavor. Come during off times or be prepared to wait due to limited seating."}
{"text":"I went to the Oakcrest Tavern on a whim today for a quick lunch on my way out of town.   I sat at the bar and had a bacon cheeseburger and sweet potato fries. A half order of fries was plenty for one and I liked that the sides were a la carte so I could choose for myself.   The burger itself was one of the best I have had in quite a while. It was served medium rare so if you want something different, you best speak up. The bacon was cooked perfectly and I appreciated a choice of cheese.   Can't speak for the staff other than the guys behind the bar who were friendly and willing to put the Blackhawks on the TV for this Chicago girl.  Will definitely return with the hubs in tow. If we lived in Madison, I could see us becoming regulars."}
{"text":"Yum, Yum & Double Yum.  Best burger I've had in Madison so far.  Delectable cheese curds.  I'm looking forward to heading over there for the fish fry soon, and when I do, I suspect I'll change my review to 5 stars!"}
{"text":"busy place on Friday nights but the fish fry is well worth the wait.  Definitely our favorite spot to go for Friday nights.  They serve good steaks as well on non fish nights."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best fish fry in Madison.  Fun atmosphere with great service.  Expect to wait for a table, so just relax and enjoy the experience."}
{"text":"Oakcrest is a great neighborhood bar. With a diverse clientele (even for Madison!) and a good amount of seating, I see why folks keep coming back.  The bartenders are friendly and the service is great.  While I haven't eaten here for a meal, the onion rings and cheese curds are well above average. On the heartier side of snacks, the chicken strips are a great choice."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  Fish fry review: Went here a couple of months with co-workers after meeting up at a local winery. Got here around 8pm, and the small tavern was still packed. We managed to wrangle some street parking and 1 bar stool for 8 of us (to order drinks). The old fashioned's were strong, but not necessarily the best I've had. 3.75/5  We finally got some high top tables (15-20 mins later) and some food.   The fish had all the right look to it. We got perch and cod. Nicer crunch to the cod, but the perch had a nicer flavor. Unfortunately, both were dry and luke warm. Overall, A-OK fish fry - good taste. Could have used a little more seasoning to put it over the top for me. 3.5/5  Slaw - little too dry for me. 3/5  Overall, I will be back with a smaller group to see if it changes the temp and dry levels. I'm sure the large group wasn't so good for the small kitchen."}
{"text":"When you first walk into this place, you know they're going to make some damn good fish.  I went here this past Friday night and LOVED the food.  The fish and french fries were cooked when you ordered them - not just sitting under a heat lamp.    The place was packed and they took our name and we had a beer while we waited.  There isn't a lot of room to stand around the bar, but we managed.  The service was fantastic - seriously, the sweetest waitresses ever."}
{"text":"Came to town for business, had the Friday night fish fry.  The perch is a little better than the cod, but both are good.  They also have a very tasty cole slaw and the fries were hot, crisp and tasty.  The price was right, with $13.99 and $11.99 respectively for the fish dinners.  Had a couple of Spotted Cows to go with it, a nice fish fry.  Pros: good food served fairly quickly, and I liked the small environment. Service could be a little more attentive."}
{"text":"Horrible.  Potato Salad in a small soggy cup. Rude staff. All fried food. Overpriced. I would not recommend this place.  In addition no parking."}
{"text":"Go for the burgers, but don't forget to order the curds!  I went to grab a good burger with a co-worker who had been told to try it out.  Both of us are new to Madison so when we were craving some grease, we decided to try it out.   The place is a total dive, but I'm a huge fan of WI dives.  It looks like a little bar that belongs in the north woods, not on a Madison street.  It's pretty small, but they cram quite a few people in.  We had to sit at the bar when we showed up because it was pretty busy for lunch.   We ordered some cheese curds as an appetizer and I'm so glad we did.  Incredibly tasty and 'fresh,' and I highly recommend it if you can manage the extra calories.   When the burgers came out, I was quite impressed.  Definitely large, and great bun.  The beef used is incredibly fresh, and mine was cooked medium to perfection with a little bit of pink.  My only complaint was that they could have used more seasoning.  While you can taste the quality of beef, it just seemed to lack spice and salt or something.  But, overall, great burger.    Just a heads up:  even though it has the quality of a dive, I was a little surprised to walk out of there dropping almost $20 for lunch.  And that's without any beer, just soda.  Granted we got the curds, and I had ordered a few extras for my burger, but I was not expecting to spend more than $12-15."}
{"text":"Nothing special about the decor.  It's a tavern, like any tavern in Wisconsin.  Oh, except with the best cheese burger in Madison.  Only one other place comes close.  The burger is always medium well when I ask for it.  It is a little dark on the outside and juicy.  I working mans place to get a good burger and watch a game.  Not fancy, but consistant."}
{"text":"I enjoyed a burger and fries on Sunday afternoon, prepared exactly the way I requested. The Knoche's ground beef makes any burger better. And with hot, crispy fries, this is perfection.  I had not visited the Oakcrest for 9 months, a victim the evening crowds and hour plus waits for the fish fry. I like the lightly battered fish filets. But, as Yogi Berra so wisely puts it, \"Nobody goes there anymore 'cause it's too crowded.\"  Although I've never ordered the filet mignon dinner, it must be pretty great to merit the $30 charge in this corner bar atmosphere and served on a paper plate. (But, it's REAL NICE paper!)"}
{"text":"I have heard the burger there was great so I was already curious.  Well the burger was absolutely awesome and the service was even better.  Very impressive.  I will for sure return.  And I almost forgot...  I got the clam strips as well and they were awesome.  Pretty sure they were frozen bought but I really don't care...  They were awesome with a squeeze of lemon and some cocktail sauce."}
{"text":"The BEST burger in Madison. Come for the ambience and local flavor. One of my favorite places to have a burger, beer and watch the Badgers!"}
{"text":"Friendly, unpretentious, good old-fashioned comfort food. Love that they buy their meat right across the street from Knocke's. Wish we had more affordable, farm to table restaurants like this in the area. Bravo."}
{"text":"We went at 5 pm in hopes of beating the rush. It was packed. We got the last parking spot and waited 45 minutes for a table. It was not kid-friendly. Most of the tables are high with barstools and a highchair could not reach them.  There was only one item on the kids menu, and it was more expensive than the adult food. Overpriced and not that great."}
{"text":"Love the Oakcrest.  Such an old-timey vibe.  The paneling on the walls is what gets me.  It feels like places we used to go to when I was a young tot.  There aren't many places left like that.    We almost always go there for fish fry.  Yep, it's insanely crowded.  Yep, the parking is horrible.  Yep, you are going to wait unless you get there at 5pm.  It's a small place that developed a large, loyal clientele and outgrew their space.  They don't have much room to knock down walls and expand.  So they have 2 choices, people.  Stay where they are and maintain their almost-patented atmosphere, or move into a new place and become just like everyone else.  I'm glad they haven't done that.  I'll deal with the crowds.  The fish fry is pretty darn good.  Get the perch.  Cod is almost always disappointing anyway.  Their perch is fresh, crispy, and not overcooked.  In the spirit of great atmosphere, they hand bread all their fish right at the bar.  You can watch them frying it up right there.  You see, they have no space, so they have to make do with what they have.  That applies not only to the diners, but to the staff as well!  At the busy times, the waitresses will weave in and out of the crowds with an impossibly large number of plates stacked up on each arm.  It's a miracle they don't spill everything.  It's that kind of place.  People go there in droves.  Count me among the faithful.  But if you don't like that sort of thing, it's best to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Classic neighborhood wisconsin bar in all the right ways.   Great food, friendly service.   Friday night fish fry is excellent (although be prepared to wait for seating).   Burgers are always a safe choice, and the cheese curds pass the authentic Wisconsin sniff test.   Good mix of beers on tap.   Kid friendly."}
{"text":"This place is tough for me to recommend.  Not because it isn't good - it is really good.  We were turned onto this place by someone who had lived in the area for a long time.  We also told him that we didn't need anything fancy.  This is a typical neighborhood bar - think Archie Bunker's Place - that I swear they knew we are not Madisonites the moment we walked in the door.  Fortunately, Wisconsin people are very friendly.  We were shown to our hightop table by Kasey (or it may be Kelsey, I've sleep since we left there).  She gave us the \"first timer\" rundown and graciously offered to let us experience all of the appetizers: french fries, sweet potato fries, fried perch, fried cod, and of course - cheese curds.  All four of us opted for burgers.  When my burger came out without bacon (which I had asked for double-bacon), our server came back with literally a BOWL of bacon. Can I have some bacon with a side of bacon?!?  Yes please!!!  The burgers were to die for.  The bacon was not from Sysco (or Walmart for that matter).  We ended the meal - and evening  - with an Old Fashioned.  I should admit that I am not a dark liquor fan... or rather it is not a friend to me.  But on our server's recommendation, we ordered three (someone had to drive) Old Fashioned with Korbel Brandy.  First off: they are BIG drinks.  Second, they go down like they have no alcohol in them.  Wait 30 minutes and you will want to find a bed to take a long sleep in.  If you have eaten the aforementioned food items, be prepared to wake up in the middle of the night needing water to help with the sodium intake.  Also, put two aspirin on your bedstand so that you can take those and go back to sleep and dream of happy Wisconsin Badgers."}
{"text":"I'm in love with the Oakcrest Tavern.  The fish fry is okay and burgers solid, but to each his own. My meal of choice after a long day is a steak, fries (sometimes sweet potato), and a beer. And boy is it good.  No Oakcrest isn't pretty or fancy. It can get crowded sometime. You're probably not going to get the healthiest options either. But it's everything I want it to be. And it's close enough to perfect for me."}
{"text":"One word: Amazing! Had the perch on Friday. Portion and flavor were out of this world.  My fiancé ordered a bacon cheeseburger just so we could taste some thing else on the menu and it was cooked perfect and tasted great. The hour and a half drive was worth it.  Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Best steak in Madison.  Previous review is correct - please go, but please don't ruin the secret."}
{"text":"Sweeney's Oakcrest Tavern is a nice little place. A 1920's- 1940's exterior design gives way to wood paneling and a multitude of flat screens indoors. To the right, a bar with a 90-degree bend and made of the same wood as the paneling dominates to area. To the left, a modest dining room sits. The room is crowded with tables and seating is close to your neighbor. Coat hooks abound. Tables are in the center and high tops ring around the walls. It's certainly cozy, and in my opinion has a bit of that northwoods supper club feel, albeit in a downscale sort of way.  I went on a Saturday with one partner and we were seated after entry at the last available table. Looking around at the dinners on other tables, I was impressed by the quality of the food as well as the portions. I saw the grilled walleye pike at one table and it looked as if they gave them a whole fish. Another table had a top sirloin that was about 2.5 inches thick and cooked perfectly medium rare along with a truly colossal portion of prime rib, also perfectly medium rare. Good signs!  After ordering, the salad course came first. Typical iceberg with a few shreds of red cabbage and 3 large, fresh carrot sticks. The ranch dressing was homemade and fresh. The vinaigrette a true vinaigrette of oil, vinegar, and fresh herbs and also homemade but note that the other dressings available are not from scratch.  After salad came our main course. I had the prime rib, medium-rare; my friend went with well done. There is only one cut, and it's a king cut at least. The thick, red meat came swimming in its own juices and had a mild, almost delicate flavor. Hers was well done, but she said it was still juicy and tender. She declared it the best she had ever had. For sides, I went with a baked potato and she with sweet potato fries, which was a slight upcharge. My potato was mediocre, but the few fries I stole were excellent. They were crispy outside and downright creamy in the center with a mild flavor. They may have been coated in something to enhance crispiness, but were good.  Service was thorough and very attentive. The crowd seemed to be very 'neighborhood' when we were there and many young children were present. They were all well-behaved even though their parents were at another table.  I'm a fan. This place was low-key, fairly priced and well-served by an attentive staff. Dinner looked great and tasted great. While it's not a date night kind of place, if you're looking for a modest place to have a good Wisconsin-style supper with your family you'd be pressed to find a better place. I'll be back to try the fish fry."}
{"text":"I recently stumbled upon this gem and wasn't disappointed. What a great tony sports/dive bar. Good beers, open kitchen and fun. The crowd was a mix of older regulars and younger college groups all enjoying good WI beer, comfort food and watching the game while having good conversation. Thoroughly enjoyed the burger and Friday fish fry."}
{"text":"Melt in your mouth Burgers Great Friday fish! Super supper service"}
{"text":"Great fish fry! The wait goes by rather quickly (especially when you have a beverage in your hand) and the place is usually hoppin'! The small space and limited parking is a bit of a bummer, but what it lacks in size it makes up for in it's delicious food!"}
{"text":"Great food, but they need to season their food. You have to put a ton of salt and pepper on anything you order. There is a HUGE difference between salt and pepper in food, than salt and pepper on food."}
{"text":"The Oakcrest... I can't recall how many times I thought about going here... I finally did one Friday afternoon for lunch. As Steve L. mentioned it takes forever  for service here. Why does my lunch cost me an hour of time?   Either way the food was good, prices were reasonable at best. This feels like your average neighborhood tavern.   Service was ok..."}
{"text":"Oakcrest is the classic neghborhood pub on Old Middleton. When you walk in, you'll notice how small it really is on the inside (looks big from the outside).  Great place to grab a burger or fish or some interesting specials. Pretty decent menu with the standard pub choices, higher-than average quality for bar food."}
{"text":"Solid Burger & fries, meh wings.  very very small place though so good luck getting a seat."}
{"text":"Greasy, Cheesy & Great! Sure, it's a dive, but the burgers & cheese curds are to die for.  I went here to quench a deadly thirst and a man-sized hunger for some MEAT. Guess what? I won in both regards, thanks to Tammy, a former-local who is now a present-global, alongside me, on The Dave + Tammy Tour, where we brag about all the Good Grub, Cool Cocktails + Tasty Treats we find all across America!  Special Note: This is also where I first fell in love with #spottedcowale (and am sad to say I haven't sipped it since."}
{"text":"Hung out here while in Madison for work and caught a playoffs game on a slow Tuesday night. Great neighborhood bar feel, friendly bartender and a random a cappella group that at one point broke out in song. Decent beer selection and one of the better bacon cheese burgers I've had in a while. The meat was incredibly fresh, a true mid-rare and the bacon was spot-on."}
{"text":"Four star bar food with a football game, what could be better. Had a great burger and fries with a beer. No complaints on anything including the service. Give it a try if in the area."}
{"text":"It has been years since I have been in here. Much of Madison raves about Oakcrest Tavern. I was driving by, it was lunch, there was a snowstorm, work is slow, what the heck - I'll go to a tavern for lunch and have a burger.  Not impressed. Not one person acknowledged me upon entry, or leaving. The waitress took her sweet time getting to my table. The \"expediter\" brought my burger but not the fries. That is o.k., but when I asked he sounded a bit annoyed and answered \"they're coming\". The guy cooking has absolutely no enjoyment for his job. It was a sad display, and since the kitchen cooking happens where you can see him, turn it on man, make it look like you want to be there.  What I mean, I wait on people. I have a service industry job and have to acknowledge and greet customers. I also have to sell them stuff. My stuff is not in such high demand that I can ignore my customer. I judge, as do my customers, on how they feel when they come in a place.  I don't care if it's old, dated decor. It doesn't do much to my impression to know their meat is ground daily and from the butcher across the street. Your place brought no enjoyment to that burger or anything else of my lunch respite.  I'll stick with the Village Green in Middleton. At least I get a greeting from the brothers who own it, and I'm not even a regular patron."}
{"text":"Seriously, it's Friday, go to Oakcrest Tavern for fish. Now. I had lake perch that was the best I've ever had, my friend had the baked cod that was bursting with flavor, not just butter! Friendly service, no reservations so the wait is common, but have a beer and enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Best customer service, great food, & fantastic pours!    Best burgers and steak in town...   Friday nights are packed!"}
{"text":"This is it. It had it all. Reasonably priced well made drinks, Lake perch fish fry, friendly locals, kitchy/dive enough to be fun, and a great staff.  Get over here you!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now. I have had the burger before and it was very good. The drinks are always excellent and the beer choices are good. I went in for the Wednesday fish fry this week and was pretty disappointed. The perch came out very soggy as if it had been fried then sat in a warming tray for a very long time waiting for me to order it. Worse than this was the taste. Extremely bland and no taste from the fish itself at all. As far as fish fries in Madison are concerned, there are many better options than the Oakcrest Tavern."}
{"text":"Best burger in Madison! Fries are great too. Try the tenderloin steak, from the butcher shop right across the street."}
{"text":"Great Food! Respectable prices. Very busy at times, difficult to get a table at peak times. Friendly environment, with clean bathrooms (that have foaming soap!)  Highly Recommended!"}
{"text":"This is a place I have come to pretty consistently over the years. In my opinion, the best burger in Madison. They get their beef fresh from Knoche's across the street, and it shows. You won't get any fancy millenial burgers with truffle oil and 84 other fancy toppings here. Just a darn good quality burger. If you want to get fancy, they have bacon. That is all you need when quality is king.   Last week we stopped in for a fish fry. If you do this, either plan on eating very early or very late. If you show up between 6-8pm, you will wait. But for the fried perch, the wait is definitely worth it. They hand bread every piece in batter before throwing them in the fryer, and it is a fun sight to watch as you drink a perfectly poured Brandy Old Fashioned.   Overall, this is the best version of a classic tavern. Great, simple food done well. You have a customer for life, Oak Crest."}
{"text":"This is a pretty standard neighborhood joint. Fairly cheap, divey atmosphere where it is not uncommon to see small children and old folks. The high chairs kind of suck but they have normal ones too. To be honest I would go here a lot more if I lived nearby. It's not that big so it can get PACKED sometimes (esp Friday)  But the real reason you go here is for Friday night Perch fish fry. I think they also do it on Wednesday but I can't be assed to look into it"}
{"text":"Its really hard to review this place. I love the idea of your local tavern, and this place fits the bill better than anywhere I've ever been. Heavily lined wood interior, big Friday night fish fry, divey atmosphere and menu. Unfortunately, that's all it really is in the end. Its not a bad place to eat by any means. Burgers are greasy and good, as are the fries and curds. Beer is cheap. A good place to catch up with folks and grab a beer. But nothing to go out of your way for."}
{"text":"I read somewhere that Oakcrest's perch is one of the best fish fries in the area. Maybe I just got a real dud of a meal because my fish was so. bland. I came at 9:30 near the end of food time, but that shouldn't affect taste, right? It looked fine and came with 5 pieces, plus 2 sides (I opted for double fries) for $14, which is a good price point. But the fish just had no flavor to it. I tried some salt and lemon juice but it wasn't doing the job. The tartar sauce was excellent and plentiful though... The fries had the same problem with total lack of flavor.   It's probably a nice neighborhood place to hang out though. It's tucked away in the neighborhood and it seemed like at least a few people were regulars that knew the staff. Relatively small and cozy place.  I would not return based on the food, but it might be a nice place to hang out for drinks."}
{"text":"PROS: Solid fish fry, cozy tavern atmosphere CONS: Small space, limited parking  We've only had fish fry here, so I can only comment on that.  I liked that the breading wasn't as thick and didn't feel as heavy as the fish fry from some other places. I felt comfortably satisfied, rather than greasy after the meal."}
{"text":"After an arduous trip to Menard's on the west side, I was hungry and mulled over my west side options.  As I traveled down Old Middleton Rd., The Oakcrest came into view, and I impulsively pulled over and walked in.  As a lifelong Madison resident, I remembered being here as a young person, and it's decor and layout had barely changed.  You could have been in any small town Wisconsin bar, which in Madison is no small feat.  There was one seat left at the bar, and the guy next to me was using the guy next to him as a trial balloon for his worldly knowledge of professional basketball.  Rather than bust his bubble with the news that ESPN had no openings, I perused the menu and settled on a Capital Amber and basket of clam strips.  Regarding this item, as one who grew up on places like Howard Johnson's and other similar franchises, I never expected to see it on a midwest bar menu.  The combination proved to be a winner, along with a side salad.  Mission accomplished."}
{"text":"Visitor in town.  Very much the definition of a locals bar.  Very friendly people coming and going and they all seemed to know each other.  I had the cod dinner and my colleague had the burger which he described as 'really good'.  Decently priced as well.    A bit off the beaten path but would return.   It's a small establishment- maybe 15 tables and it's cozy but wait staff was awesome."}
{"text":"I hate giving only two stars for such amazing burgers, but my most recent experience was annoying. There was a large group taking most of the space in the dining area, which is fine, except for the vast amount of noise - so much so that conversation among other tables was almost completely limited, but we got to know the large table of college students very well. On a Sunday during lunch hours it took about twenty minutes to even get a waiter, then another to receive two sodas and place orders. Meanwhile the large table ordering alcohol most certainly received the most attention.   The food was still good, obviously the burgers being the best choice (the rest is fine, but typical bar food). It took two staffers to successfully serve us, and this took a total of about 90 minutes...way too long for two burgers and cokes. The large table was so vocal (I can tell you much of their life stories) other customers left, so it was disappointing to see the staff not ask for just a little less noise in such a small building.  If you're looking for a good burger and don't mind possible noise or wait time, you won't be disappointed. If you're going with a large group, maybe choose a larger venue."}
{"text":"Really disappointed. Oakcrest has been one of my favorite places to get a burger. This evening our burgers were not only overlooked but under-seasoned. Our fries were nice and crispy but also lacked in any seasoning."}
{"text":"Lunch or dinner, you can't go wrong at the Oakcrest.  If you get a burger, be sure to get bacon.  I don't know what they do, it is one of the best bacon cheese burgers around.  A hidden gem that has outstanding flavor and is very fulling is the Chicken Teriyaki sandwich.  It a huge chicken breast and the two pineapple slices are great.  Last tip, the cottage cheese is solid, get it as an alternative to the something deep fried.  Only challenge about this place is parking, so be ready to park on the street."}
{"text":"The Oakcrest has been around for a long time and I know a lot of people like it, but it just doesn't do it for me. I work right down the street, so I met up with some people for lunch recently and boy did I regret it. I should note that this was not my choice to begin with, but I was willing to give it a try.  It is true that there isn't a lot of seating, but it wasn't extremely busy when we got there and our service was fast. We were in and out in a little over a half-hour. I agree that the staff didn't seem particularly friendly or happy, but they weren't rude either. I had a chicken sandwich with bacon and no side, while my four companions had burgers with fries or cheese curds. Everything was typical greasy bar-fare. I tried the curds but not the fries. The flavor was good, but it was so greasy and salty that my mouth was burning by the time I was done and my gut was already churning as we walked out to our cars. I was miserable for the rest of the afternoon. One member of our party felt the same, but I believe everyone else enjoyed what they had.  In all fairness, I know my experience is a fairly individual one. I eat very healthy food and I hardly use salt when I cook or add it when I'm out. If you typically eat like this, you'll probably love it. I probably would have loved it before I shifted my diet away from this kind of food. However, I do enjoy burgers and fries at places like the Great Dane and the Grumpy Troll, where they aren't grease-laden and loaded with salt. If you have a diet more like mine I wouldn't suggest eating here. I don't plan on going back, but I still give two stars because my experience my not reflect yours."}
{"text":"Always our first stop when visiting family in Madison. Fun, local atmosphere with great food and drink. Their fish frys should not be missed!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing bacon cheeseburgers, cheese curds were perfect. Great \"dive\" feel to the restaurant. Staff was great' friendly and attentive. You may have to wait for a table if you go during prime dining hours."}
{"text":"One of my favorite bars in Madison.  Great burgers and the best tenderloin steak sandwich around.  The fries are tasty as well.  Stiff drinks and a nice neighborhood bar feel reminds me of coming here as a kid with my dad."}
{"text":"Everything we got was amazing, the cheese curds were perfect. I can honestly say this was the best burger I have had in Madison. The Prime Rib was delicious as well. Great atmosphere. Best bar"}
{"text":"Well, I'm always in search of fantastic dive bars. While Oakcrest is not the biggest \"dump\" you'll find in Southern Wisconsin, it still meets the criteria of a quality dive establishment. The typical bar menu eats are made right in front of you when seated at the bar and the place is seemingly clean with friendly service and patrons. The burgers were cooked to our specifications meaning I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I've only been here for the fish fry about 20 times. It's the best in town, period!"}
{"text":"Good food, reasonable drinks, lots of flat screens (albeit small), nice staff, typically crowded with regulars, Fish Fry on Wednesday and Friday, don't have daily \"bar specials\" and the table tops are kinda always sticky so deal. Overall, a good place to grab a beer and burger."}
{"text":"I went here for Friday Fish Fry last Friday and it was simply delicious. The place was packed during a blizzard - that says something!   The service was very friendly and fast. Their ranch was so good! You watch them hand batter the fish and make it right in front of you. Yum! I had the cod, my boyfriend had the perch and both were absolutely delicious.   My only critique: have the fries be a bit crispier!"}
{"text":"Oakcrest Tavern had been recommended to me a ton so we decided to try it out on a Saturday night. It was crowded, which we were warned about, but it felt cozy and supper-clubby which I liked. We were able to grab a seat at the bar despite the busyness. We we're able to order drinks right away and the old-fashioned was good and made the proper Wisconsin way. We got a table soon after we sat down, it was a little confusing though. I think it is seat your self but wasn't really directed by anyone, also didn't see any signage.  We had heard good things about their burgers, fish fry and prime rib. Since it was Saturday I tried the prime rib and my husband got a burger. The prime rib was pretty good especially for the price but nothing special from other supper clubs in the area. My husband's burger looked really good and he enjoyed it. Overall pretty good food but I am looking forward to coming back for their fish fry to see if that stands out a little more."}
{"text":"Nothing too special here just good burgers, crinkle fires, and cheese curds.  You can find other Wisconsin favorites here too.  The joint can get crowded and they will cook the burgers to medium/medium rare so make sure to specify how you want it cooked."}
{"text":"We love local tavern type spots (think Village Green in Middleton) and finally made it to Oakcrest after months of talking about it!  We went on a Saturday night at 7:00 pm and only had about a ten minute wait!  Walking in the door sort of feels like you're walking into a living room...great bar, open space, mix of high and low tables all lined with wood paneling, TVs, and beer signs!  We had an energetic and attentive server, Crystal, that always made sure we weren't without a drink!  We had a cheese burger and a ribeye sandwich.  Both were awesome...burger comes from across the street at Knoches and was a no frills perfectly booked burger on a perfectly soft and crusted bun with tomato and onion (drooling as I type this)!  The ribeye sandwich was also great and simple served on the same type of bun, we added grilled onions.  We also had a side order of the clam strips (which I almost never see in our area) and they were equally great...a nice change of pace from fries!    Beer selection was great and priced fairly...the old fashioned tasted like a mix (don't know if it was or not) so we will most likely stick to beer next time!"}
