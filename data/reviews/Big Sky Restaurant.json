{"text":"What a delightful find and a masterful experience This restaurant is a must. We were greeted warmly by Nancy and sat immediately.   My husband chose the Scottish salmon with tempura asparagus on garlic mashed and I had the curried porkchop on polenta.   Perfectly prepared .. the seasoning  so delicate and rich yet not overpowering. Chef Shaun so talented!   I understand he smokes his own meats and the desserts are made on sight by the talented Laura.  Highly recommend ...you don't need to drive to Madison to enjoy fine dining.. cozy and warm you will feel like you are part of the Big Sky family after 1 visit."}
{"text":"What a great place!  When my wife and I dine out, we tend to seek places that not only have great food, but is a great experience.  Big Sky is that place.  The atmosphere is warm, the staff is friendly, the presentaion of the food is over the top, and the meal was prepared perfectly.  If you have not been here, do yourself a favor and go.  To have a place like this in Stoughton is amazing.  If you are in town for the Opera House....this is a must."}
{"text":"Huge fan of Big Sky.  Service was very good, ambiance was cozy (no country music playing per other review) and the food was special.  We all had the NY strip special; the blackened seasoning & hollandaise sauce complimented a huge and tasty NY strip.  Loved the house and Caesar salad.  Wine list small but nice quality.  Finally, creme brûlée and coffee were a nice touch after a great meal."}
{"text":"Went for their opening night.  Very impressed for the first night in a new restaurant.  Very warm atmosphere and staff are extremely friendly.  Owner is the chef who has many years of experience in the business but wanted to open a small place in a small town.  Came away feeling we had made a new set of friends.  They have a complete menu of \"small dishes\"  which we did not try but friends who were in the restaurant told us the crab cakes were excellent.  For entrees I had the Beef Tenderloin wrapped in a thin strip of ham which was very good.  My wife had their Salmon dish which was also very good.  Because it was their first day they didn't have their full menu available so we didn't get to sample other dishes.  We will certainly be back soon.  The Malbec wine they served was French and was very good especially at the price.  We took name so we can purchase for home."}
{"text":"I have been so blessed to live in a town that has Big Sky! Tonight Chef Sean topped himself, as if that is possible. I had the Tenderloin Oscar. Perfection!!! It was served on a bed of herbed rice, my choice, and beyond compare....open flame grilled veggies. Perfection. This is my favorite place. The menu changes regularly. The chef is open to your tweaks on his food. Fresh ingredients, locally sourced when possible, eco-friendly. Fabulous. A must visit."}
{"text":"I really want this place to be good!  We live in Evansville and get tired of going to Madison when we want a nice meal.  We would love for this place to take off and for the squeaks to get worked out.  

The menu is pretty impressive - so I hope they can pull it off.  We like the things that they are trying.

We went there within their first week of business - during Syttenda Mai - so the town (and the restaurant) were very busy.  

*  It was the waitress's first night.  She had no apparent training.  Please train your staff before you throw them to the wolves. 

* Well - my first item cascades down to other issues - like our check which should have totaled about $70 - but was presented to me at $109.  I asked for a recalc on the math - and it was better the second time.

* Salads were not served before the main course

* I had the fettuccine bolognese, a dish I enjoy a lot.  There was no seasoning.  It was super bland - though the pasta was cooked correctly and sauce had the right consistency.  I had to add a lot of salt - which helped some.  

* Nothing on the walls - please find some artists to show work.  Should be easy and will help reduce the echo in the dining room.  Also - some light music would enhance the quietness.  

The menu looks great - with getting the squeaks fixed we look forward to many dinners with you."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dinner for four last night and can't believe we haven't come here sooner! Food was amazing! We tried two appetizers the mushroom stroganoff and the crab cakes, both were wonderful. Everyone had the beef stew over mashed potatoes which was amazing. Creame brûlée and chocolate casserole were amazing as well. Will be coming back soon! Great good and people! Such a warm and friendly environment."}
{"text":"The menu was diverse, the quality of ingredients fresh, and portion size most ample.  My hubby and I WILL return and are happy to have REAL cuisine so close to home!"}
{"text":"Tuesday evening, not crowded, but it seemed to take a long time for the food to arrive.  The special, shrimp puttanesca, was ok.  While my dates, crab cakes seemed to be mostly breading and very little crab could be found.  Service was attentive.  The company at our table made the evening enjoyable.  This being our second time here, not sure we will return."}
{"text":"The food is good, not amazing, but solidly good.  The prices are high, in line with a small fine dining establishment.   The service is friendly and while the overall pace of the meal was good, getting a server when you really need one was hit-and-miss.   The timing of the entrees out of the kitchen was off, with my entree served several minutes after everyone else had been served.  The atmosphere is chic but the dining room is very loud, a problem when members of your party are hearing impaired.  I would try them again in the future though."}
{"text":"Dined here once during the week. The food was good but not remarkable. The staff was green but friendly. I'm very happy to have this restaurant in our community. I wish that it had something more (ambiance? prices? a signature dish?) to lure me there on a regular basis."}
{"text":"We ate at Blue Sky about a week ago.  It was good, not mamzing, but a solid good.  The service and atmosphere was great!!!  I think this place will get there!!!  If you are in-town for a show at the Stoughton Opera House, this is the place to eat (better than Laz's for the $).  I say give-it-try!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent fine dining.  The chef is extremely talented, and has been known to create meals on the fly based solely upon ingredients he has on-hand!"}
{"text":"My wife and I attended a special valentines dinner at the Big Sky Restaurant, in Stoughton WI. The owners prepared a special VD menu, with four entree options. I had the lobster, my wife the filet mignon. This was our first visit. Quite honestly, this was the best meal I've ever eaten, at any price. Every course was spectacular. The wine was spectacular. The service amazing. We have a new favorite that is fortunately 20 minutes from our home. You seriously have to try this place.

Or...don't. We don't want to compete when making reservations."}
{"text":"The maiden voyage  ... such a pleasant surprise!  This is a quiet, cozy and refreshing fine dining experience.  Worth every star!  Fabulously friendly service seemed genuine and not over the top. Tonight's menu consisted of lump crab cakes, spinach salads, grilled Scottish salmon and wild mushroom strudel ... had to take the carrot cake home.  The meal was timed perfectly.  Absolutely no hesitation about scheduling a return visit and look forward to doing just that!

Encore voyage ... Second time was even more of a charm!  Hard to believe that the crab cakes could be any better, since they were fantastic the first time ... they were amazing tonight.  The salads of mixed greens were perfectly dressed with a satisfying vinaigrette. There was pistachio dusted scallops on one side of the table, tonight's special scallop dish with sweet potato hash on the other.  Two words ... oh my!  Do not pass up any chance you have to dine at Big Sky!"}
{"text":"This is a first-glance review.  This place is in my town and I want it to do well so I'm treading lightly after having been there only once.

On a Friday night, the place was full.  That's really good for Stoughton, even on a Friday.  The service was a tad frantic, but friendly and helpful.

The wine was good and reasonably priced.

My wife and I definitely liked the crab cake, full of crab and not overbready.  I thought it was a bit too smothered with the avocado and other yummy garnishes.  Seemed a shame to mask such good crab.  The salad was fine.

The Osso Buco should have been more tender, more falling off the bone, and it wasn't hot all the way through.  The saffron risotto that it was served with was perfect--al dente, done with arborio rice and real saffron, and nice and hot.  It came with thin asparagus spears.

It's so hard for a place in a small town to go through slow weeknights and then get slammed on Friday and Saturday.  You're not built for that peak business like bigger-city restaurants.

Big Sky is still young and very promising.  We will be back and will expect great things."}
{"text":"I've lived in Stoughton for a year now, but this was my first visit to Big Sky. An out of town friend was visiting and we were just looking for something besides pub food or Mexican cuisine. And boy, what a pleasant surprise! It's a very small, intimate bistro with a clean and neat menu and a nice wine list. Our waitress Laura made an excellent wine suggestion to pair with my Chef's Choice pasta that I very much enjoyed! It's a little pricey, but I think it's fair! Every part of my meal was delicious and the service was amazing from beginning to end. I will definitely return and recommend this restaurant to others. Way to go, Big Sky!"}
{"text":"We went here for my birthday based on the reviews but I am sorry as most of what we had was mediocre and overpriced. I was expecting the schnitzel to be thin and crispy but instead I got 2 heavily breaded, thick pork chops. Me husband thought his bolognese tasted worse than hamburger helper. My daughter scallops were okay but for $84 we were counting on a gourmet experience. This is not it, better drive to Madison. A shame as Stoughton could use more nice restaurants."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant in the area.  We celebrated our 30th wedding anniversary tonight and everything was amazing!  I had the salmon, my husband had the pasta special and our son had the tenderloin, all dishes were exceptional! This was our second trip to Big Sky and we will be back. Thank you for the wonderful comped dessert, it was very thoughtful and completely delicious. (Creme Brûlée)"}
{"text":"My wife and I spent an oh-so-enjoyable evening in this fine dining restaurant recently and we were very pleased with the meal and our entire dining experience at Big Sky in Stoughton.  

Located in a renovated downtown storefront, the restaurant provides a very pleasant, cozy atmosphere for an intimate dinner for two or a celebration with friends.   

The Caesar salad dressing was AMAZING - without a doubt the very best I've ever tasted.  My wife had a trout dish and I had scallops - both were fantastic.  Excellent desert selections.  Friendly and attentive staff helped make the evening superb. 

As other reviewers have commented - the crab cakes are fabulous and definitely worth trying.  We had a nice bottle of wine with our meal.  The service throughout our evening was outstanding.  We left very happy and looking forward to returning.  

Reservations are recommended, especially on weekends."}
{"text":"The food and service were awesome! The chef came out during our meal to check on everything. This restaurant may be the best in the area. Our server, Laura, was so friendly and nice - couldn't have asked for better service. 

We were served the rosemary bread (so delicious!), salad, I had the mushroom strudel, and my fiance ordered the seafood pasta special. We shared the vanilla creme brulee for dessert. Everything we ate was delicious. Cannot recommend this place enough! 

Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food and service!  The special for the night was angel hair pasta with scallops, shrimp, spinach and tomatoes and we highly recommend it.  My husband and I shared lemon cheesecake made and served to us by Laura ( who couldn't have been more attentive, professional and fun! ) and this was the most moist cheesecake we've ever had!  This was a great night for us and super enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Decent wine list. Great service and the food was awesome!  It was a bit on the pricey side and the menu short and sweet.  if you do go, the bacon wrapped shrimp is amazing.  We had 3 \"small plates\" which were not small by any means.  And the owner came to our table and chatted with us about the ingredients and our plans for the weekend etc.  It is a cute, family run restaurant with upscale food you would expect to find on the square and not in Stoughton.  We will go back to try the entrees, keeping in mind the range from roughly $20 to $39.  I would give it 5 stars but they had country music playing on a poorly placed sound system, and the decor is not spectacular.  For the price of the food I would expect a litter better ambiance."}
{"text":"A couple weeks back, we were in the mood to get out of town for a nice quiet dinner together. So my husband, Joel, and I decided to give Big Sky a go after all the positive things we'd heard. Well, I'm here to tell you, the stories are true, my friends. Big Sky is definitely worth checking out. We had such a lovely experience. Here are the highlights:

It's a smaller place so be sure to call ahead for reservations if you're able. Chef Sean is as quirky as he is talented, and I mean that with the utmost respect. The man can cook! His wife, Nancy, is warm and welcoming and personable and kind, as is Laura (who lovingly makes all of their desserts).

I ordered the pork schnitzel with garlic mashers and fresh asparagus. Joel ordered one of the Saturday night specials, the pasta Bolognese. My meal was delicious and HUGE (many left overs) and nicely balanced. Nancy encouraged me to squeeze the lemon wedges over the pork and I'm glad I listened as it was a game changer. Who knew a little lemon could elevate schnitzel like that?!

The pork was very flavorful - caramelized just enough. And while it wasn't pounded down flat the way I've had other schnitzel in the past, it was still quite tender. The asparagus was sweet and perfectly cooked. Joel let me try his pasta and as much as I was enjoying my dinner, I immediately had massive food envy. I wanted his meal! Not kidding!!! #sorrynotsorry

It was, quite literally, the best Bolognese I've ever had. Even better than Lombarino's, which is saying A LOT, you guys. So there's that. Side note, that dish isn't on their regular menu (it's a special) so be sure to order it if/when you see it. Joel doesn't drink alcohol so dessert proved challenging for him as most of the options had some form of liquor in them. He went with the cheese cake which he enjoyed (although he said if he could do it again, he would have gotten chocolate sauce on it).

I was torn between the crème brulee and the lemon lavender sorbet (apologies for the subtle rhyme). I chose the crème brulee and the lovely Laura added a tiny scoop of the sorbet to my plate for me to try both. SO THOUGHTFUL!!! And again, while the crème brulee was very good, that sorbet was so amazing I could barely even think about the main dessert sitting in front of me. It was just sweet enough, but gave a good jaw zing and the subtle yet incredible addition of the lavender was pretty much the best thing ever. I really hope to have that again sometime.

Thank you, Chef Sean, Nancy and Laura! We'll be back at the end of April and we'll have a couple friends in tow as well. Can't wait!!!!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately probably the best food in Dane County. Foolish people like me will probably share the experience we had when dining here. We will tell you how the food was perfection and the service was superb. 

Then you will go and try it for yourself. You will be somewhat skeptical since it is \"so far away\" in Stoughton. Then you will realize all the reviews we either spot on or maybe didn't even say enough how good it was. You will then be just as foolish as I was and post a review here. Others will read it and follow suit and venture out to try Big Sky. Soon we will all have a 3 month wait for reservations and we will be sad that it is so tough to get in. 

Remember it's our fault when that happens not the perfect food and service but all our own doing."}
{"text":"Wow...swung down for a show at the Opera House and decided to check this place out. Simply superb. Fabulous service. The bacon wrapped shrimp are fab...the crab cakes are uniquely cool.

Don't use the Opera House as a reason...this is so worth the trip. And, we'll be back."}
{"text":"The food was ok. Not worth the price. The restaurant is pricey for the Stoughton area. The owner/chef seems to be arrogant. The staff is friendly enough. When we passed the restaurant later in the evening we noticed several staff members outside smoking. It was not attractive. I don't think we will return."}
{"text":"Great dinner last night at Big Sky.  Our party had crab cakes, grilled shrimp with polenta, outstanding lamb with mango chutney, and salmon.

Perfectly cooked, and great service."}
{"text":"Just tried this place last night.  The service was excellent. The staff was friendly and attentive.  Everyone at our table enjoyed the food. It was beautifully presented and arrived in an acceptable time frame.   I would recommend this place to anyone lookingfor a nicer place to eat.  It is small and I was glad we had reservations."}
{"text":"Excellent food AND in Stoughton! Two phrase I rarely use together. Great food, quaint atmosphere, friendly staff and owner. Amazing cheesecake. Our go to restaurant when we want quality food w/o the drive to Madison. (It's also worth the drive from Madison.)"}
{"text":"Have eaten here twice, blown away each time! Well worth the cost for a nice sit down dinner."}
{"text":"My husband and I celebrated our anniversary at Big Sky.  We are from Stoughton and had heard nothing but wonderful things about this place, but had never visited before.  My steak was perfect.  My husband wishes his salmon was good a little more, but he enjoyed it, nonetheless.  Our waitress, Laura, was superb!  A bit pricey for everyday, but well worth it for a special occasion, fine dining experience.  I highly recommend Big Sky."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in the area by far! Try the crab cakes, you won't regret it! Make sure you save room for dessert.. the cheesecake is my fav!"}
{"text":"We went to Big Sky tonight for the first time. Even though we live in Stoughton and have driven by many times, we had no idea what a gem this is. There aren't many entrées but the three dishes our party tried were all phenomenal! The prices are on the higher side but well worth it for those special occasions! We will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Highly recommend! Had a late Friday night dinner. Awesome food, worth the cost. Paid about $75 for two meals: a beer, greens salad, bread, crab cakes, salmon entree, pork schnitzel entree, cheesecake dessert. Everything tasted amazing, and the service was great too!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a rare find. Flavor is the highlight of your experience. I had lobster crab bisque. Had to stop eating and focus on my taste experience. That was followed by a grilled shrimp and scallops dish on open face ravioli. Wow. Portions are just right. Leave room for desert. All home made and amazing. 

Husband and wife team make this place rock. If you are in Stoughton and want an amazing meal, you must stop here"}
{"text":"Nice and quiet on a Saturday night. As everyone has stated, the crab cakes are amazing and a must have!!! Had the scallops in a potato bowl as that was the special and it was amazing as well. The scallops were perfect. Also had the rib eye which was fine, had a lot of fat and was a bit undercooked. Would have given this 5 stars but the dessert was less than average. Grilled pound cake with ice cream and berries. Pound cake was grilled which only made it taste like burnt toast. Will definitely return and worth the drive. Service was friendly even tho they were short a waitress."}
{"text":"I have to agree with other reviewers that I've been waiting for a place like Big Sky to show up in Stoughton and I also really want it to be good.  The place does look perfect and the ambiance is great for date night or a nice dinner.  However, we've been there three times now and our experiences there have been spotty.  

First time:  Made reservations but when we showed up there was no record of them.  So we waited at the bar but it took awhile for someone to take our drink orders.  However, the owners put the drinks on the house.  Very good.  So we ordered the crab cakes, steak au poivre, and the tenderloin.  We waited quite some time for the food to come out and we got our entrees first and then the crab cakes came out.  Hey it was the first two weeks after opening.  These things happen.  The steak au poivre was good and the steak was cooked perfectly.  The tenderloin was ordered medium but came back toast.  Crab Cakes were delicious though.  Very good.

Second time: Came on a Tuesday so pretty slow.  We ordered the salmon and the pork duo.  Pork duo was ok while the salmon was tasty.  However, the bread seemed like it was old and had been reheated to freshen it up.  

Third time:  Only 2/3 of the tables were filled but when we showed up the waitress told us she had to check and see whether the kitchen could handle the volume.  This place only has about a dozen tables.  We saw a couple after us get denied even though there was an open table.  Not a good sign for a restaurant to turn away business when the tables aren't full.  We ordered the Mussels (Special), Farfalle, and Catfish.  First bread again seemed day or two old and was reheated to freshen up.  Mussels were good but not $16.50 good.  The Catfish was cooked perfectly and so were the rice and beans.  However, there was no seasoning though.  It was extremely bland and lacked salt and pepper even.  There are no shakers at the table.  I respect that if you know how to season your food as a chef. The Farfalle had a cream sauce that was so thin the pasta was swimming in it.  You need to thicken your cream pasta sauce.  Big no-no.  

Overall, the servers are great.  Most need to be more educated but all were very friendly.  The wine list is good and reasonable.  Desserts are always good but I don't know if they make them there.  The dishes for the most part have been tasty at times.  Big Sky just needs to get its system down and improve on some things.  I'm not expecting the creativity of an Iron Chef but for the prices the overall experience needs to be improved."}
{"text":"The food and service were both amazing.  This is a husband and wife run place and they make you feel like old friends.  We stared out with salads-lovely mixed greens and balsamic.  Pauly got the tenderloin which was perfectly seasoned and cooked.  I got this salmon and crab in some kind of creamy sauce over pasta: amazing.  Dessert... Flourless chocolate cake and port wine.  Omg every bite was a taste extravaganza!  We will be going back for sure!  Perfect date night!"}
