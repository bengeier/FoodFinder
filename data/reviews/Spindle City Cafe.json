{"text":"This sweet cafe has a special place in my heart because it's the first business we visited in Gastonia. It made a good impression. It has a wide variety of choices between sandwiches, salads, soups, and hot dogs. The quality is very good - homemade, organic salad, good flavor. It's a little pricey as an everyday lunch spot if you get the specials, but there are also some sandwiches and hot dogs you can get for less than $5. I go for the egg salad or tuna salad sandwich, and they are very tasty, and you can add a lot of toppings (bacooooon) for free! The staff are great - Cameron, who is almost always somewhere in the cafe, is efficient and gets to know anyone who comes in more than a couple of times by name. He knows my order and is always very kind. A note for dairy allergies - I'm allergic to dairy, and this is a safe place. I never have reactions, and the staff know about my need to avoid dairy. They take care to keep my food away from contaminants. It's a gem of a cafe!"}
{"text":"This was just the cutest cafe ever!  The food was great, especially the broccoli salad.  Customer service was excellent!  Pricing was great for the high quality you get. Wish there was one closer to Fort Mill so I could go more often!"}
{"text":"Tuesday, just before noon on a cold February day, lots of tables open and just enough people in front of us to give us time to choose.  If I was in town for a week, I could have a different sandwich every day.  

Order at the counter, pay, and get a number and go to your table.  Your food and drinks come to you shortly after.  

The Tomato Basil soup was good and homemade.  The Chicken Salad Press was tasty on whole wheat (your choice of 5 breads).

Friendly service also.  And a bottle of Coke was only $1.50."}
{"text":"This restaurant absolutely deserves 5 stars. The food is always delicious, the restaurant is clean, and the staff are absolutely delightful - very friendly and hard-working. 

It's wonderful to have a dependable little local lunch spot in the area with great food and the same smiling faces at every visit. I hope they stick around for a long time!"}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place on the way through town. So glad they are open on Mondays! I had the Brie & blackberry grilled cheese with tomato basil soup & orange crush cake for dessert. SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"Excellent recipes & fresh, organic salads. Home made soups, dishes, even cakes! Family owned business open for excellent, mouth-watering lunches."}
{"text":"I have to give this 5 stars because of melty sandwiches. I mean, who doesn't like them? This is everything a Main Street cafe should be. 
Their choices of bread really finish it off. For a legit soup and sandwich combo this is the place to go. 
I just really wish they were open until 5, is have their soup and sandwiches for dinner too if I could."}
{"text":"Corporate moved the office from south Charlotte to the other side of Gastonia so we have been trying different places around the ton. So was looking for fresh foods found thus place on Yep. Had the famous chicken salad press sandwich on sourdough. Good sandwich, just the right size for lunch. The sough ws really good soft not hard and tart like Pan.... tha dread place, got the fresh mixed greens side salad with baccon, cheadder cheese and ranch dressing. Needed a fancy ranch dressing not the normal bulk container from restaurant supply. The salad was good the occasional raisin was nice. May be a bit to much for some at the office who like burgers and fries. They need to get real plates, bowls and glasses, baskets and styrofoam did not go with the food. Would have much rather had to clean the table myself than had styrofoam. Service was great we had beat the rush, could get slow. We will be back."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! The pimento cheese grilled with tomato and bacon is fantastic! The service is on point too! Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Soooooo tasty and what a great location(if you ever need to go to down Gastonia).

This place is not your run of the mill diner/sandwich spot.  They take the time to do it right.  You can make your own sandwich, but their specialties are pretty spot on so just let them do their magic. The first time out, I went with the SCC Club.  The freshness of the bread and the creaminess of the avocado add so much to this \"\"traditional\" sandwich.  For only $1.50 more I added some soup.  I think it changes daily but I had a tomato bisque that was awesome.  A hair on the salty side, but it balanced the creaminess beautifully.

The next time I went, I tried the Cali sandwich, similar but the cayenne aioli is where its at.  I went with the made in house potato salad as my side and wasn't disappointed there either.  I had a small side salad as well, and was pleasantly surprised to see an organic spring mix.  

I overheard some local firefighters ranting and raving about the spuds, so next time I'm over that way, I'll give it a try.

The service was so-so.  My waitress had some beautiful eyes that I wouldn't mind looking into again, but they were really busy, so I didn't expect much out of her.

Till next time, and there will be a next time."}
{"text":"Quick lunch at this neat spot in downtown Gastonia. This storefront restaurant boasts art for sale and exposed brick walls in it dining area and was a perfect spot for a quick meal. 

I chose the pressed chicken salad sandwich and it was delish! You choose your bread and side item and I selected sourdough and broccoli salad. The bread was grilled and had honey mustard and mixed greens added before a heaping amount of chicken salad was added. I did hold the tomato, but otherwise ordered it as it came. I would highly recommend it. The broccoli salad was ok, but I doubt I would select it over another side the next time. It is not mayo based, which is fine, but didn't really have a sauce I could detect, possibly vinegar based toss, but it was basically raw broccoli and a few carrots on top. The sandwich was definitely the star today!

My friend ordered a Reuben on wheat with a side salad and said it was very good and even took half home because there was so much meat on it.

There isn't a sign on the building so look for the sidewalk sign when parking or you'll miss it"}
{"text":"Short version- good food, not expensive at all, walking distance to court house

Longer version mixed with rant- Quaint little cafe less than a quarter mile from Gaston County Courthouse (I was there performing my civic duty as a potential juror). A lot of options plus daily specials that are really good and won't take all of the financial compensation from sitting in a room all day twiddling thumbs... I had a big steak salad and cup of soup for less than $10. Everyone is super friendly, like come out to hug regulars and know people by first names friendly... I don't want jury duty again, but if I do get tagged I will come back to Spindles"}
{"text":"Out of this work delicious! Get the blackberry and Brie grilled cheese! Everyone there is so nice and helpful!"}
{"text":"This sandwich shop is an absolute gem in downtown Gastonia.  I left wishing that they had a location in Charlotte; it was that good.  I had the chicken salad press, which was to die for, as was their home made potato salad.   The atmosphere is also really cool; it is in an old brick building with high original ceiling, robust with character."}
{"text":"Super cute cafe, great service, and awesome sandwiches and soups! My husband and I are new to the area and this is the first place in town we stopped to eat. We've been back a couple of times and really enjoy trying the different sandwiches."}
{"text":"A cute little upscale lunch cafe.  Only open 11 - 3.

Soup, creative sandwiches and baked potatoes, all you build/condiment yourself.  Ingredients are mostly organic especially the salads.  They make their own dressings and some of the sandwiches are \"pressed.\"

Soups change daily and are made in-house.  Very good ones.

Fast and friendly service which allows this small location to process a lot of lunch traffic. It has been open for over five years, so that speaks for how nice and good this little place is.

A bright spot for Gastonia."}
{"text":"Spindle City Cafe is the perfect lunch spot in downtown Gastonia. It is a great option if you want something quick, affordable, and delicious. A lot of professionals from around town come here for lunch, but it is filled with all kinds of kinds. 

The sandwiches and sides are creative and they really seem like they put a lot of time and effort into getting it right. On my most recent trip, I ordered the Ham, Brie, and Apple Press. This sandwich was delicious the apple added just the right amount of crunch and the honey mustard that it came with went well with the brie and ham. I got homemade potato salad as my side, which was also very good. 

The thing that sets Spindle City Cafe apart from other sandwich places is the service and atmosphere. On my first visit in, a person, who I assume was the owner, took the time to talk with me and explain the concept. The service is always fast and friendly. The atmosphere is really laid back and cool. The whole theme is obviously the cotton/textile industry. They have the theme down. From the large spool of cotton on the wall to the door with cotton balls surrounding it. 

Spindle City is delicious, affordable, and has a really cool atmosphere. This is a great example of what a main street cafe should look like. If you are ever in Gastonia and want a quick lunch with a cool atmosphere, Spindle City is your spot."}
{"text":"Food was wonderful. I had the special of the day which was a Greek chicken wrap and as my side I got the Chicken tortilla soup. Staff was friendly and helped when needed."}
{"text":"Pleasant little cafe on the main street of Gastonia. Mostly sandwiches and sides, with a few salads and a soup of the day. Everything is served in styrofoam, which I hate, because it's not recyclable. The irony is that they have a recycling bin (which people throw styrofoam into; is anybody checking this?). But that's just a pet peeve. I can't believe that a restaurant in this day and age can't buy biodegradable or recyclable serving dishes and cups.

The food was fine, if not wow-worthy. Had the blackberry and brie grilled cheese (it had apples in it, FWIW), and tomato basil soup. Both were acceptable, but nothing to prompt a return visit. This is a pleasant little cafe with pleasant food. Probably won't disappoint. In my case, it didn't impress, either."}
{"text":"Clean, reasonably priced and delicious.  Great choices of sandwiches, wraps, and soups. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Best place for lunch in Gastonia.  Friendly service and a very unique atmosphere.  Who knew such a place could exist in Gastonia!"}
{"text":"Staff was awesome and friendly. Has the chicken ranch on a wheat wrap. The broccoli salad was amazing. Had a slice of home made pineapple cake. Definitely want to check this little gem out its awesome."}
{"text":"Based on Previous yelp reviews,checked out while in town on business. Had Great service,better sandwiches,and an amazingly creative menu,That was equally delicious.they have homemade soups that change from day to day,I tried both a ham Brie and apple pressed sandwich,and a chicken salad that was probably the best I've ever had.(hope my mom doesn't see this) great atmosphere right on Main Street."}
{"text":"After 5 years of being open,  I finally stopped in this place for the first time.  The service was fast, the employees kind, and the chicken salad pressed on homemade sourdough was awesome! I will definitely return to conquer the menu."}
{"text":"The place is clean and quiet. The sandwich (ham and swiss) was delicious. I chose the pasta salad as my side and was not disappointed! It wasn't expensive as I was expecting."}
{"text":"This was the first time eating at Spindle City Cafe. I wait staff was extremely helpful. I decided on the roast beef special. Lots of flavor. So many awesome menu options. I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"I'm impressed. I stumbled across this just looking for a lunch spot, wanting to eat somewhere new. Located in Downtown Gastonia, amongst the original architecture. Maintains a warmer but industrial feel inside with great food. Kind service. 
Best of all of s the unique menu items, i.e. smoked Gouda crab bisque, and hummingbird cake."}
{"text":"Love it!! Great food! Awesome customer service! I eat here so much they know my name! The ham apple Brie sandwich is SO good!! You have to try the smoked Gouda crab soup - delish! The pimento cheese sandwich - drool! They have salads and wraps too!!! Leslie at the register is so friendly and sweet. EAT HERE!!"}
{"text":"Must come support tv a local gem downtown Gastonia. Sandwiches are amazing everything fresh and homemade. 
Sun drop puns cake was so moist and flavorful. Come try them out."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot! The menu has perfect selections and included several vegetarian options. I went for the grilled cheese on sourdough and broccoli salad. Came out in a flash and fantastic flavor-- garlic is a nice addition. Park on the street and browse the other stores in downtown, too!"}
{"text":"Outstanding!! Stumbled upon Spindle City Cafe when driving through, I would come back in a heartbeat. Sandwiches were fresh with fantastic flavors. Clean restaurant, friendly staff, charming place!"}
{"text":"Great service, fast prep, needs more spice and flavor. The super fresh veggies help but a sauce or two would have made the dish."}
{"text":"First time there, probably the last  I got the pressed Reuben with a side of slaw ($7.50)  the wife got a tuna sandwich ($5.00) with no side  both sandwiches  were pretty good but both a little light between the bread for the cost.  Not sure why it only has a one $ rating because it's a tad on the expensive side."}
