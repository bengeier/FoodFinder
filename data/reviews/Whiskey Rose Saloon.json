{"text":"The hubby, myself and our 11 year old decided to try this place out and had a great meal! I had the mushroom Swiss burger and it was seasoned well and was very juicy. Normally I ask for mayo for my burgers to add some moisture, but didn't have to on this burger. My husband had fish and chips with a side of Mac and cheese. Both were very good. The Mac and cheese was nice and cheesy! My daughter had honey BBQ wings and smacked them down. I managed to get a bite of one and they were pretty good. 

The nasty comments about the wait staff by a couple other reviewers was unnecessary...could be toned down a bit, but no need to be mean!

We will go back again in the future I'm sure!"}
{"text":"Nice thursday surprise. Really good draft beer. Great vodka tonic. Split the mushroom burger and it was almost truffle like. Really good meat with a great tomato. The onion rings were really good to. Service was excellent. Went back again yesterday. I had fish and chips and my wife had the apple bacon cheeseburger. Both were great. Bacon was sooo good, we could have eaten a plate of it. Friday and Saturday they do have music."}
{"text":"Awful!! Waitress sucked! Took her 10 minutes to get our drink order.. Food was worse.  Waitress was sure quick with our check.. Don't know why, she didn't get a good tip. Stay away!!!"}
{"text":"I had lunch at Whiskey Rose Saloon the other day. I have to say I was very pleased. I had the Santa Fe burger it was cooked just right, juicy, and flavorful. The bun was fresh. The service was excellent I had Alex as my waitress. Not just my waitress, the whole staff was attentive and warm. I will return."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today, nice atmosphere for a country bar. Still suffering from the food. The brisket was dry almost like it had sat in the crockpot for ages. The fries and onion rings were full of grease. All of us had swelling issues after the meal so I believe salt was a main ingredient. The waitresses wore red thin strap tanks with  short jean shorts and boots. All were very friendly. It's a huge bummer because it was a neat concept. Guessing it isn't what Chandler is looking for though. Don't eat here."}
{"text":"This is the first time we have been to this place in quite a while.  The first time we visited, about a year ago, it was pretty good.  I would have given it a high 3 to 4 stars  Apparently it is under new ownership for at least the last couple of months. 

Went there for lunch yesterday around 12:30 and the place was 80% empty, should have been my first clue.  Ordered and appetizer and lunch.  It took 25 minutes to get the appetizer, which came at the same time as everything else... again, the place was practically empty.  To boot the order was wrong.  Food was mediocre at best.  

The supervisor did comp the meal that was wrong which we appreciated, but apparently there have been lots of issues since this new owner took over.

It's too bad.  We want to see all the Chandler restaurants do well and thrive.  This place is in a great location plus the atmosphere and look of the place is outstanding.  A great start to what could be a great place to eat and drink.  My suggestion:  the owner needs to get his head out and either figure out how to manage the place or get people that can and save this place from going down."}
{"text":"Couldn't be happier that this place arrived in chandler!! The food is fantastic! They have kick ass all day daily specials on top of a great happy hour with a pretty awesome draft selection!!! They also have live music with room to dance if you feel like it! Love it, will be a regular!"}
{"text":"Great food especially the chicken skewers with the lemon garlic sauce and the cornbread. There is live music on the weekends. Also, free kids meals on Sundays and Tuesdays."}
{"text":"Wife's Pulled pork was mushy like Baby food .
My rib tips were half rock hard and greasy. I had heartburn for 3 Days.
Did somebody say \"5 Star Chef \". Well I guess things happen, but then again, there was hardly any cars in the parking lot."}
{"text":"Fast fast service, the food was excellent, and everyone was friendly! It had the atmosphere of Texas roadhouse but a lot quieter. The ribs literally fell off the bone and the salmon was excellent!!!"}
{"text":"We had a fantastic experience!!  

The service was amazing and the food was even better. All of the entrees had a ton of flavor, making you want more!
I ordered ordered chicken skewers but when it came out, I was convinced that I ordered the steak skewers.  When two people at my table said that I did order the chicken and not the steak, I obviously ordered the chicken.  
The runner had already taken my food back and had the server put an order in for the steak skewers.  When our server came back to our table, I apologized and she gave me the chicken and said that the steak would be out.  Clearly, it was my fault so I asked her to cancel that order but she said that they were already being made and that we could take them home.

I am amazed with the customer service.  I made the mistake but they did everything that they could to make sure that I was happy.  It's good to see that there are still some businesses out there that care about their customers and their experiences.

Two thumbs up!!  We will be going back."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened to this place.  It used to be good.  Now food is bland and I refuse to wait 50 minutes for a mac and cheese appetizer.  Nor will I wait forever for a beer refill.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"I just went here for the first time and I thought it was great! I had a pulled pork sandwich and mac & cheese and thought both were delicious. We also got the red velvet brownie and ice cream for dessert and ate the whole thing right up! The weather was great so we sat outside and it was very nice. There was a live band playing which made it fun, and the service was great. The manager came out to check on us and everyone was very nice! I will definitely go back there."}
{"text":"We were at Whiskey with some very good friend last wednesday and really enjoy the food, our server Alicia was really nice and helpful, we highly recommand the place.

Food is excellent, the service awsome.

Good job"}
{"text":"Great food but it is \"chain-y\". The servers dress like they do in hooters which is a bit of a turn off but overall good food."}
{"text":"I went to this place about 3 or 4 months ago and  I wouldn't have given it more than 2 stars. I had the BBQ chicken which was horrible, needless to say that I didn't eat it, the brisket was very dry, seemed like it was probably for 2 days old. (Not saying it was).
A friend of mine was visiting from out of Town last Friday and wanted some BBQ, so with some trepidation I took him there. We ordered the brisket, and some BBQd chicken, and there was a remarkable difference. 
As we dined, there was a live band playing, i don't know their name but they were pretty darn good. Anyway, as we ate a gentleman came over to our table to check on us, and asked how everything was. I was very candid with him as to my thoughts of the place during my first visit, and now. He indicated that he was a new manager and he was trying to change some things for the better, including the quality of the food, I never got his his name, but he has black hair and wears glasses, probably in his mid 40s, nice guy, very pleasant to us.
I will definitely return, and if things continue to improve, I may even give this place 4 stars."}
{"text":"Ok, on a Saturday night,  not busy, over 30 min waiting for food for a family of four,  my son's  burger had a very weird  taste, our appetizers were below AVERAGE.I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURANT.  We waited 15 minutes for our check. The manager took off $1.35!!! Are you kidding me!!!!  DO NOT GO THERE!!"}
{"text":"Because of a coupon, we went there for lunch, without great expectations.  We were pleasantly surprised that the food was good and the service was excellent.  We will definitely go back.  This is also a very family friendly place."}
{"text":"Worst service in recent memory. After an hour they came out and told me they ran out of pizza dough so my kids meals weren't coming. Then 2 seconds later they tell me their orders made the cut. No one knew what they were doing. Never going back."}
{"text":"Guess we will have to see if this place survives, go in on any day at the same time and compare to Zipp's (in the same general area), Zipp's is packed, and this place is almost empty. don't get me wrong, Zipp's is not that great, but too bad this place is just so so. Go on a Wednesday afternoon and you can get cheap call drinks (Jim or Jack). Other than that, nothing special, food is just marginal. Unless they really step up their game, this will be another empty building......."}
{"text":"We have been coming to Whiskey Rose for a couple of years and WAS a local favorite of ours. We came just after the new owners took over and were disappointed, but thought they just needed to work things out as all new places (owners) do.  Unfortunately, things did not work out.  Something has happened to the food quality and quality control.  Our orders were not correct, our server recognized it without us saying anything, however, she never corrected it. Food was room tempature at best, dried out and over cooked.  My wedge salad had the entire core in it. Really? They were understaffed for a Saturday night so things were slow.  So sad, but we will not be going back."}
{"text":"This place is near home so I've been here a dozen or so times, mostly on weekends, to have drinks at the bar & listen to live music. They have good drink specials such as the past Sat. there were $3 premium Mexican beers (bottle or pints) $3 margaritas and $5 premium margaritas. 
The bar area is really small & could benefit from a remodel as we've arrived many times on the weekend to find no room to sit or stand and gone elsewhere.
Food is standard bar food, nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with everything the establishment had to offer.  Ordered the brisket sandwich - what came out 30minutes later was something that  carried an old recycled texture from the night before  - nothing resembled a BBQ sandwich. The bun was saturated with grease (from what, idk - the brisket was dry and had no moisture)  Very unhappy.  The restaurant theme seemed to resemble a \"Wanna be\" Coyote ugly theme with  high-school girls dressed of very cheap in very little clothing. Very distasteful.  The help more concerned about breaks in back?  Service was very slow - we had to pull people aside to find our waitress, of which we were told had a 'mysterious emergency outside' we could have actually left without paying.   They missed the mark with Ocotillo - this was more of a down town Tempe place.  Guaranteed to be closed by end of year"}
{"text":"We have visited twice now and both times they were out of our menu chooses, it felt like I was eating in mom's kitchen. I then decided to opt for the brisket, big mistake. It was so dry and over cooked I needed copious amounts of fluids to choke it down. I'm a huge fan of BBQ and brisket is one of the more difficult meats to smoke. Wifey loves their corn fritters so we will probably be back for those.
 I'll give it one more chance and order the ribs. Ribs only take about 4 hrs to cook makes them the easiest meat to smoke. If the ribs are bad I'm done there, because if you screw up ribs, you're unable to properly smoke anything else. It gets one extra star from me because they made my wife happy with the corn fritters."}
{"text":"Great Southwestern fried chicken. Some other stuff on the menu looks really good. Staff are sometimes nice."}
{"text":"Horrible.  1st time we went for lunch and we were one of about 3 tables so it wasn't bad, just nothing that would make us run back.  Tonight we wanted to get something close to home so tried there since it was close.  Ended up walking out after waiting almost an hour with still no appetizer in sight...everyone around us was annoyed too.  Steer clear"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place.    It has great food and great atmosphere. It's not usually crowded.  But it's getting more and more popular!"}
{"text":"Food is ok, but I'll only eat here when there's a groupon available for half off (which seems to be pretty frequently)
Service is spotty, usually slow and they mess up the orders sometimes."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised after eating at Whiskey Rose. I was visiting my family and they said they wanted to try this place out. I went on Yelp on the ride there - I wasn't too excited to try it out after reading their reviews...

I was definitely scared to bring my family here after I read about the waitresses - they were a little ditsy, but at least they were dressed appropriately for a family friendly bar.

I thought they had a decent beer selection, including some local brews from SanTan and Four Peaks.

I ended up trying the brisket with fries and mac & cheese. The brisket was actually really good - cooked perfectly - super tasty. I dug the mac & cheese too - with the crispy layer on top, exactly how I like it. My least favorite were the fries, but they were still pretty good - anything beer battered is good in my mind.

My family said the food they had was pretty good too. My little sister is a mac & cheese fanatic and loved it, so I'm sure they will be coming back sooner than me since I live in Scottsdale and it's a little far for me to come on a regular basis.

All in all, I was impressed with how everything was based on the previous reviews. Definitely give these guys a shot. We need more non-chains in this area."}
{"text":"Amazing food and drink specials! The burgers are my personal favorite. Can't wait to try out the rest of the menu. Awesome service."}
{"text":"The food is excellent here. Drink specials are good. When Rattlecat Junction plays, the place rocks. Try the Bbq Mushrooms  - YUM!

Just went again last weekend and ordered a bacon cheese burger. It was the best burget I have ever had. 

This place has become our favorite hang out. The drink specials on Friday nights are great. There are also happy hour food specials which always make me happy."}
{"text":"Took the family here for the first time and was definitely not impressed.

The pros:
- Cool building, seems like a nice place to have a beer
- Plenty of TVs
- Brisket was decent

The cons:
- Pretty much any of the other food we ordered including the rib tip appetizer just wasn't good. Nobody wanted to finish their meal other than the brisket.
- Even after the waitress asked if we wanted the appetizer out first, it came out with the rest of the food.
- The entree sized Santa Fe Mac and Cheese is almost as small as a side order of regular mac and cheese. Small! Cmon.
- The waitress never checked back after bringing the food. Sure do get thirsty waiting for that water that never came.
- It might seem silly to point out, but after this not so inspiring experience, the server topped it off by bringing the credit card slip without a pen. Simple mistake? Well the table next to us had the same thing happen so obviously there are no pens anywhere in this establishment.

In summary I really did want to like this place given that it is close by and I do like the decor. However with the whole experience taken into account I just can't imagine going back."}
{"text":"I came in around 7:00pm after a long day of persecuting felons. There was a lady behind the bar, the bartender I'm assuming, I don't even know her name because she never gave it to me. I sat down calmly and said, \"good evening\". I waited about 10 minutes before she even came up to me and asked me what I wanted in a almost rude manor. I calmly smiled and asked for a dinner menu. After about 3 minutes I sat the menu down and waited for the lady behind the bar. Another 10 minutes went by and I finally caught her attention and told her I was ready to order. She was very short with me, I felt embarrassed to even ask for a glass of water. I ordered these appetizers that were these jalapenos filled with cream cheese and a bland indescribable meat! Yuck! I asked if the lady behind the bar if she could make the bacon crispy and she scoughed and then said, \"no problem baby\". I have a wife, so saying \"baby\" doesn't smooth over very well when I tell this story to my wife!! The appetizer was awful, so I stopped eating it. I am very upset with this tall, ugly, rude, black haired-green eyed raccoon that is being rude to me and servicing me awful food! I can't believe this is the type of establishment that is near my Chandler offices! This place needs a new staff and it's obvious that the manager doesn't know the first thing about customer service! I've never been to a bar with such awful service in my entire 38 years! If I were the man/woman running this place I'd fire that old, rude lady and hire the young, beautiful, SWEET AND SMILING!! I'd also hire a different cook for this restaurant... it seems like its impossible to fix this food, the menu ideas are fabulous but the quality is horrible. Grade F all the way around.

P.s. I am using a fake name due to being a high profile state legislative"}
{"text":"First and the last time I will ever go to Whisky Rose. I had the ribs which were very overcooked and had absolutely no flavor. 

The pulled pork my wife ordered tasted like boiled pork...again no flavor or seasoning. 

The server seemed completely lost. She had no idea what the seasonal beers were or what the daily specials were."}
{"text":"we  love this place. The food is great. My picky picky husband and fabulous cook went gaga over the brisket and rib tips. I am conservative and had chicken. The french fries and sweet potato fries are wonderful, crispy and tasty.  The servers are very friendly and eager to please. Jessica and Logan are A+. Logan looks like Ryan Gosling, not bad eh!!
Will be back often. Also prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Had to go back again on my next visit to the valley! They changed their bloody Mary mix and now they're even more delicious! I just love their mac & cheese! It arrives hot and has lots of cheese sauce on it! These are definitely My faves at Whiskey Rose! 

Everyone is always so great here and different people check in on you to make sure you have everything you need with a smile!

I wish we had one in my neck of the woods!"}
{"text":"My roomie and i went to this place. The server was okay but with as many people as there were in the place- we really waited quite some time for our 1st drinks about 10-15 minutes.. approx. We ordered the tornadoes poppers and they were prettty good except for the chilis needed to be cooked thru more-- they were a bit hard which made them REALLY hot which really it is supposed to just have a nice \"BITE\".  So, the cook didnt cook them properly... Also, i ordered brisket and it was actually pretty tender but NO FLAVOR... They are using the wrong chips to smoke this. THey need to watch Robert Irvine's shows & food network. Almond chips do best with brisket.. My roomie ordered the barb ribs-again NO FLAVOR - they are not cooking them correctly - but overall - salad was delicious.  Waitress then forgot about the beer my friend ordered and he had to reorder it from her. He sat and waiting for about 15 minutes more... that was really ridiculous. The server was in the back of the kitchen talking to her friends... The manager gave me a drink which was nice that he helped out-- but why didnt he wonder where my waitress was???  We were going to give her a 21 percent tip to be nice then it dropped to 18 percent because she dropped the bill off and then left for 20 minutes... and my roommate had to catch a plane in the morning at 6a.m. so we needed to leave.  He wont be back again- but i may go again to listen to the music."}
{"text":"One of the worst run restaurants I have ever been to.  Given all the other one star reviews, I am not surprised this place went out of business."}
{"text":"A groupon made me aware of this establishment. It is a little far from my home but it is worth it.  The food is high quality bar food.  The moonshine was phenomenal.  The atmosphere was spacious.  The waitress was friendly and happy.  Bonus this place is perfect for groups of 6."}
{"text":"Great new spot in Chandler! Should check it out for sure!! Have been there a few times, mostly just for drinks after work. Bartenders and servers were great on all occasions. Decent selection of beers, but stated they were adding more craft beers soon. Have tried a few appitizers, havent been in for dinner yet but will soon. The pulled pork nachos were HUGE and delicious, also torpedos and fried pickles were amazing! Bands every thursday, Friday and Saturday nights so will defiantly be back for some dancing!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!!! For the steak salad and wow... 

Staff was all super friendly and helpful!

I'll b back!"}
{"text":"I'll be nice with 3 stars
Dropped in for a Saturday lunchtime snack and a beer, ordered the Mac and cheese which was supposedly a signature dish... Meh it was bland and dry. For a bbq place to not be able to knock Mac and cheese out of the park...."}
{"text":"We use to go here a lot til they changed the mac and cheese. Even the bartender back then said they did. Which now is awful. But it's been 7 months at least, thinking well maybe they went back to the normal Mac and cheese. Not even. We ask the waitress tonight and she even said its bad. So ordered the platter sampler all was not good. Potatoes skins were baked potatoes with topping and it was deep fried which was black. Nothing tasty but the fried pickles. Wings sucked too. We left a lot on our plates with no doggie bag.  the one at west gate is still best to go! Hate to see Stacy go. She probably went where they serve good food. Not ever going back even with a coupon or free gift card."}
{"text":"Mostly good, but the desert was a huge letdown. Got dragged here due to famous (now infamous) bacon pecan pie my date was craving.

Bacon Pecan pie - More like a casserole/soup of a pound of bacon and alot of pecans and brown sugar, but only four strips of pie crust on top? It wasn't cooked enough according my companion and according to me it was the worst desert concoction this side of the Mississippi. If you need a soup spoon to eat \"pie\" change the name. This had some potential in actual pie form.

Sliced Brisket. - after a hand trimming of fat which was easy to pull off, this turned into a really great brisket sandwich (some people like the fat). It was moist, tasted well smoked and was a large serving. BBQ sauce was average.

Sides: Sweet potato fries were hot and salty, on the better side of these things and then we ordered with the Yelp check-in a free appetizer. Those were loaded potato skins, but they needed more of that brisket that was supposed to be in there instead of the chili it was overloaded with. Also a tad undercooked.

The restaurant was empty at 1pm early in week, but the manager, after receiving some bad info from waiter, bounced back and was very pleasant and gave us a free appetizer coupon. The waiter had an interesting Elvis or New York accent, but he retrieved my phone from booth seat and tracked me down in lot and was attentive throughout the meal. The only issue was that he never gave us a lunch menu
 (7 for $7), but luckily I picked something from main menu that was on that menu and had a 7 buck lunch."}
{"text":"Disappointing...The deep fried Mac and cheese was flavorless. Nothing tastes fresh. My baked potato was dry and hard. Rib tips were disappointing, the sauce tasted store bought not homemade. Probably the worst corn bread I've ever had. The iced tea was cloudy didn't taste good. I was really hoping for better based on reviews but they must being paying for good reviews."}
{"text":"Sometimes you read the reviews on Yelp and you wonder if some of the reviews were just exaggerating.
The BBQ was a bit mediocre.  The cab wine was decent.  
However, my \"baseline\" for rating food is based on some good BBQ over in Texas and in North Carolina.
There are some other good BBQ places to sample.  For example, there is a place called Joe's on Gilbert Rd.  Not an original name & there is no alcohol but the BBQ is outstanding.  Another place is one called Tom's BBQ that is not too shabby. It has several locations here in the Valley."}
{"text":"Just left there WITH OUT eating! Waited probably 5 minutes and no one EVER showed to even welcome us! Bar server had told us to be seated and they would be right there. NEVER HAPPENED. Had a $5 coupon to use since Rose supports Hamilton High"}
{"text":"I am an avid yelp follower and if it isn't 4 stars or more I won't go.  I went with my gut this time and ignored the reviews and tried Whiskey Rose.  I have no idea where the reviews are coming from for here!  From the atmosphere to the service.  The Jalapeño Torpedoes,  the Fried Mac N Cheese (only $4 each on Happy Hour)  to the Hog and Heifer burger and Pulled Pork Sandwich.....  I was so impressed with them having multiple servers bring out one tables food at once to keep no one waiting!!  In a world where people complain and don't pay compliments where due...  I wanted to take the time to do give them a review they deserve. Definitely give this place in shot,  especially if you are in Chandler!!"}
{"text":"So first time here, wanted some bbq w the boyfriend.. At 830 on a sat night. And we saw a check in for a free appetizer and thought let's try a new place instead of famous daves or Texas road house.. Well first the hostess wasn't so pleasant.. But she's a little girl so I forgive her. And then it took awhile for us to get anyone to come get our Order so the hostess come up super rude \"what do you want to drink.\" Then we got our free appetizer which was fried mac and cheese balls.. Super Good! And then the food came.. Which was good. I c an say they're food is really good and ribs were some of the best but if you get fried chicken ask for gravy on the side it was overly salty but our server was awesome, just busy. If your looking for a bbq place in Chandler then it's the place the foods good, maybe just over salty batch of gravy? But if your wanting to come strictly for food this is the place. But if your wanting atmosphere it is not the best place for it. Live music but it was almost more depressing lol then they put on country after which changed the mood so much, so if your looking for atmosphere go to bourbon jacks."}
{"text":"We bought the Groupon this week and after reading the reviews, I must admit that I was a bit hesitant.  There was absolutely no reason to be skeptical.  This place was simply spot on.  Our server made great recommendations and was very friendly.  The manager came over to day hello.  The happy hour specials were some of the best in the East Valley.  The service was prompt and the food was actually too hot to eat.  The kid's menu was excellent and the food was very tasty.  I suspect some of the negative reviews may have come from the restaurant's soft opening.  We ordered the fried pickles, wings, burgers, mac n cheese, pulled pork and brisket.  The fries and onion rings were also good.  I will certainly return and strongly recommend the place."}
{"text":"Love this place. I live nearby so after a long day at work its nice to chill on the patio. Waitresses and bartenders are super cool! They will even come outside and get you another drink! Fun live music  not the wildest place but it is super chill and they have good food and happy hour!"}
{"text":"Hey laaaaaaaadies!

Need a job as a server in a casual/sports/cowboy-themed bar? Do you happen to have a tramp stamp? Muffin top? Not enough boobs for hooters? The IQ level of a kindergartner or less? If you answered \"yes\" to All, this is the place for you.

Not only will you uncomfortably stop by my table umpteen times while our plates and drinks are still visibly full, but you'll also give us a disappointing look when we tell you, for the umpteen time, that we are OK with food and drink for now. Since you are a *star* employee, you'll ignore that and still say \"are you suuuuure you don't want to order more apps? entrees for everyone? shots? No??\" 

Then you will show us the beer list which will consist on a torn piece of paper, hand-written by you (I can tell by the little hearts on the \"i\"s) and tell us that those are the Happy hour specials, which we will go off by and order. Then when the bill comes, you'll charge us full price for a Blue Moon ($5) because its not on the Happy hour list, which doesn't actually exist because you forgot to mention that the list you showed us had nothing to do with happy hour.

Woopsies. right? Totes happs all the time, hehe. Luckily your good looks and *charming* personality will totes save you from learning how to serve correctly and letting us enjoy our happy hour time. Good for you * insert stripper name here*, Good for You."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this place is going downhill. Not sure the reason. Poor service with ok food."}
{"text":"Meeting with a business client of a personal business opportunity.....great service great atmosphere here ...INTEL friendly lol....wayne :-)"}
{"text":"Sad to say that this was probably our last visit. They've changed the recipe for several items and the food was very disappointing. We used to love the pickle chips but now they're bland and not worthy of ordering again. My husband loved the beef skewers but they were so bad he didn't finish them. The salad was made with old lettuce and the BBQ beef was dry and tasteless. 

To top it off, the waitress was pleasant but far from concerned about our food coming on time, whether the food was prepared correctly and how to answer questions about the menu. 

To top it off, they sent the hostess home early (8 pm) and I had to go find someone to see if we should seat ourselves. 

The only positive change was the Mac n cheese. It used to be made with fake velveeta cheese but now has real cheddar. 

If this restaurant stays open with the new preparation of the food and dismal service. I would be shocked."}
{"text":"Food was so bland. Everything was cooked really well and great portion sizes but overall the food was kinda flavorless."}
{"text":"Besides Zipps, this is one of the worst restaurants that I have ever been.  We came here over a year before a Hamilton football game and it was horrible.   Today it was worse! We waited over 20 minutes for water, our order was wrong and the hostess and waitress were completely overwhelmed.   It was probably 30% capacity.   So disappointing.   I really wanted it to be better.  Save your money. ..go to Jack In The Box!"}
{"text":"This place is meh.  It ranks above Chili's, Applebee's, and Olive Garden FOR SURE but the food is just okay.  I had the sliders plate last time I was there and it was just meat on a bun - dry.  Our appetizers were the same as at any other place you've ever been - chicken wings with too much sauce, pita chips with dip (not enough pita chips to go with the dip).  The service was fine but not stellar.  I requested a hefe and the server (we were seated in the bar) didn't know what that was - hefeweizen.  Not that that's a big deal but it was just one more little notch toward meh.  And I hate to give negative or meh reviews.  I had high hopes for this place because we don't have many non-chain restaurants near us.  Oh well."}
{"text":"So we heard from some folks and gave the WRS a second chance and I have to say, what outstanding service even though we came in incognito.  The food we ordered was very tasty and the customer service was outstanding.  Whisky Rose, its management and staff should be commended for taking a customer service oriented approach to their business.  Thanks for the hospitality!"}
{"text":"You know,  whiskey rose has a rocky start and we almost didn't give it another chance, thankfully we did!  Service has improved SO much,  the food is really good, the atmosphere is unique as far as restaurants in Chandler go.  There is live music some nights, kinda cool.  All in all its a great restaurant! So if you are concerned that there are bad reviews, ignore those, because whiskey rose has definitely improved."}
{"text":"Show up with a party of 15. Called 2 weeks prior and made the reservation so they would not be bombarded with a huge party. Waited 20 minutes for and ice tea while my entire party received their alcoholic beverages. Specifically asked the server if there was celery already mixed in the salad. Was advised no it was not and asked for no celery or blue cheese crumbles. Well guess what it had celery mixed in with it. I will not be returning. It was such chaos."}
{"text":"GREAT BBQ! Went to Whiskey Rose for the first time on Friday and fell in love with their BBQ sauce. It's the perfect blend of sweet and spicy. My husband and I ordered the \"Whiskey Feast\" which was plenty of food for two, plus enough to take home for lunch the next day. Our friends stuck to appetizers: nachos, wings, potato skins and shrimp tacos. ALL GOOD - especially the $5 25oz beers."}
{"text":"Ehhh.......not impressed. Pretty dead when I was in there. The Bands play on the floor.....probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Very disappointed - went one night the food & service were both terrible! Will not go back here!"}
{"text":"Had a Groupon. Was excited for burger sliders.....they turned out to be a regular sized burger cut into pieces and put in mini buns..really? :(

Was excited for hummus trio..the hummus was getting old, so it made your tongue tingle. My dogs ate it though. 

Service was good.

I'm a server so I didn't wanna complain..but I think I spent $46, including $10 for Groupon, for old food..not going again."}
{"text":"This place is all about the wings, burgers, and most of all ribs!  I can't express how good and how large the portion of ribs is that they put on your plate!  They also have some really good happy hours, and the environment has a good feel.  A place where I could sit at the bar for a few hours, or come for a meal.  The wait staff is also really helpful.  My beer never went empty so that was a great thing.  When you come here order the ribs and you won't be disappointed.  It has a really tasty smoked flavor, and I was really surprised to find it here!  At the end of the day, the people here try hard to make the experience a good one.  The manager John came to our table and made my wife and I feel at home, so I have to say like Arnold, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This was a total whiff. Bummer too, since as others have mentioned, the area could use a winner.

We ordered an appetizer that had just come out. A manager came by to check on us, looked at the dish and asked, \"What's that?\" I kid you not. The manager could not identify it. And that was pretty much the highlight.

I had the \"pulled pork,\" which I put in quotes because it had clearly been sliced, not pulled. It had solid chunks of fat and connective tissue that do not belong in pulled pork. If it had actually been pulled, none of those things would have been able to get in there.

To be fair, the fries were actually pretty good, about the only thing worth eating.

The staff was nice enough, but the managers were all over us asking how things were. We gave the \"great, great\" in a bid to make them go away. It was like, man, if you don't already know, nothing I can say is going to help.

As someone else mentioned, the girls were showing so much belly skin that even this red-blooded American male thought it not at all appetizing. I saw at least one older lady who was aghast that she was being subjected to this -- the others in her party seemed oblivious.

Hopefully whatever restaurant moves in after this one will have a better formula."}
{"text":"This place just came up on Groupon.  What a terrible choice!  We ate here for the first, and last, time about a month ago.  We had been told it was bad by our neighbors and should have listened.  The service was lousy.  Our waitress was having too good of a time with the guys at the bar.  She gave us a menu and came back with our drinks about fifteen minutes later.  We ordered and got our slop about thirty minutes later.  It was getting lukewarm by then.  Even though we left half our food, we had to wash our hands after eating.  I guess I should be less critical about the waitress as she appeared to be the only one on duty.  It was only four o'clock in the afternoon and not time for the big rush.

Recommendation:  Trust your neighbors!"}
{"text":"Fried pickles are delicious & free if you use the check in coupon with the purchase of an entree! 

No a lot of vegetarian choices though :( I had to get a chefs concoction of pick de galo & toasted garlic bread. Not so great, but I was starving. 

I did however have a delicious drink that tasted like Hawaiian punch, I think it was called the rose.  I did get to try the onion rings which I recommend, super greasy though!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant and bar. We decided to give this place a try during the week of their grand opening. The decor was rustic - which went great with the live country acoustic music, service was exceptional, and the food cooked perfectly with great flavor. We ordered fried pickles & and Mac and cheese, along with a saloon burger which was actually cooked to order perfectly!  The fries were also surprisingly delicious.  The server was friendly and happy, and actually seemed to enjoy being there. We have been to other grand openings for restaurants in the area and none of their employees seemed to be happy or informative of the menu. We will definitely be back as they are hoping to have live music during some weeknights or at least Friday and Saturday. The GM checked on us and seemed genuinely interested in how our experience was and to tell us all about what they have planned. So glad to see that this nightlife area is picking up! Thanks Whiskey Rose!"}
{"text":"The food is good. My wife really liked the fish. Service was average but we went on a Friday night when the first opened."}
{"text":"They feature live music.  I don't know when, but a coworker's band was here this night.  So we showed up.  Several 1-star reviews made me nervous.

First impression:  pricey. $9 sliders is too much.  Three typical-sized sliders. Happy hour cuts that in half, which is OK, but at full-price I don't think so!!  Flavor was pretty good if you use the sauce they provide. Otherwise they were just ordinary pork.  No evidence of smoking or seasoning.

Wings were better because they were cooked with a sauce.  Again, very pricey unless you get 1/2-off for happy hour.

Service was not very attentive.  We were in the bar, but not sitting at the bar.  Maybe they were short-staffed?  Don't know.  But we only saw her occasionally.  When we did manage to get her she was friendly and would get whatever we wanted.

I just can't go to three stars.  The food was overpriced for the quantity given, and while the food was \"OK\" it wasn't really anything special.  Perhaps their entrees are bigger/better?  Well, I can only rate based on what I had.  Yes, I did get happy hour pricing.  Which I had to remind them when the bill came.  They fixed it, but it was still annoying.  I think 1-star is too harsh, though.  They were better than that.  But I've definitely \"experienced better\".

Local beers available."}
{"text":"Sad sad sad! My girlfriends and I like to enjoy happy hour and went to whiskey rose to check it out.  Went there on Tuesday and the service was horrible. The bartender payed 99% of her attention to the  bar and not her tables. The rib tips were chewy and seemed microwaved. We also checked in on Yelp and unlocked a free app. We knew to do this from the advertisement on the table and the bartender acted like she didn't know about it and even questioned the app a little. Very uncomfortable. We tried to order another drink and never got it. We finally had to go to the bar to get out check since apparently the bartender would not
Leave from behind the bar. We left and went to Zipps next door. Very disappointed! When in the area we will choose a different place."}
{"text":"We were here for the Chandler Chamber Business After Business Event.   Good food, great atmosphere, excellent service!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Whiskey Rose many times since it has opened.  It has slowly gone down hill.  BBQ sauce once was excellent!  Over time it changed to a store bought brand.  Prices have gone up by a wide margin since it opened.  Service is ok and food is ok.  Zipps has better frys and better union rings and just as good burgers."}
{"text":"i was driving by and I yelped before stoping in and what a surprise
beautiful atmosphere, great food and very attentive staff along with a very warm and hospitable management.
i will definitely go back next time i visit Arizona, by the way, try the Man & Cheese, is to die for.

Great job"}
{"text":"Service very slow. 40 minutes before appetizer came out. She apologized and said ticket was lost. I asked for my burger extra extra extra well done. It came to me very red. No discounts. No complimentary dessert. She never checked on us. Not once. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Returned to Whiskey Rose a 2nd time and it is just as awesome as last time!

Great service, awesome food and love the festive atmosphere.

We had the bacon burger, Mac and cheese and bacon wrapped stuffed jalapeños ...soooo good! I rarely like the Mac and cheese at restaurants because I'm a MnC snob...it is really good here.

Love the stuffed mushrooms and stuffed jalepenos -- not the ordinary kind with just cheese -- have brisket and pulled pork in them -- yummy!

We haven't tried the BBQ but will definitely try it after reading the review from the guy who said he didn't like it and Joe's BBQ is better --- I grew up in Texas -- I KNOW BBQ and I really don't like Joe's BBQ at all....so I will probably like the BBQ here :-)"}
{"text":"This was a favorite place at one time,  now it's just an occasional visit. Third round of ownership,  who knows what round of staff change. Drop in service and quality of food. Change is a necessity,  but does not always go well. When I visit, will be just to see a few old friends. Such a shame WR!!! Numerous health code violations observed during visit, will not even eat here now (Bar employees and servers touching RTE Food with Bare Hands)"}
{"text":"Staff really nice. Cheap happy hour! Food and drinks not very good. Seems like a bar rescue joint. Not very impressive! May try 1 more time!"}
{"text":"I had a Groupon for this place and after reading the reviews, I was going to let the Groupon expire.  I am glad that I didn't!!! I came in to get a steak and the only steak on the menu was a sirloin.  I asked the waiter if they had any other cuts of meat and he was happy to oblige.  He brought out the food and it was a 10 oz Bacon wrapped Filet which they charged me the same price as the Sirloin.  
  
The steak was amazing, the vegetables were sauteed in garlic butter which made them more enjoyable.  The waiter suggested a rootbeer for my son, because they had it on tap and it was delicious!!! 

The staff was very accommodating and the owner came over to make sure the service and food was up to par.  I explained that we almost didn't come because of the reviews and he said they had a rocky start and had changed management. 

I don't often write reviews, but I did feel like this place did not reflect the reviews I have seen on here.  I had a wonderful experience.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good! I'm not quiet sure why it has gotten bad reviews--- I went into this place expecting it to be horrible, but it was pretty dang good. I got the burger which was a little small, but cooked to perfection and delicious. I subbed out the fries for mac and cheese for no extra charge(which is nice). The mac and cheese was amazing as well! The service was impeccable, and you can tell they really have cared about their reviews. Happy hour specials are wonderful too, half off appetizers from 3-7, can't go wrong there!"}
{"text":"Came here once the food was terrible the service was even worse. Ended up here with a group of people because we are at Hamilton high school decided to give it one more try. Food was actually worse and the service was no better. Would never come here again, advise to stay clear of this restaurant. By the way the GM or Manager is a total B***h."}
{"text":"What can I say... Awesome food. Great atmosphere. Chef is awesome and not bad on the eyes either. Corn Fritters are outstanding! Memories of my mom...when food can do that, it's good stuff."}
{"text":"Great service. Yummy food! 

We visited at lunchtime, it wasn't too crowded and we were seated right away. Our hostess brought us drinks and a few moments later, the waiter came over. He was very nice and made some recommendations for us. The food was absolutely delicious and cooked to perfection. The manager stopped by and asked if everything was good. It was a very pleasant experience overall. I wouldn't hesitate to eat here again."}
{"text":"What a great place to always come for live music! One of the best country bars in Gilbert/Chandler area! Tony Martinez, who opens for Jake Owen and other huge hits plays here, what an awesome guy/band whose down to earth. Go sit at the bar, Sara is extremely friendly and they all provide awesome customer service, would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"We visited Whiskey Rose about 6-8 months ago, and like others, were very disappointed.  Several friends said the service and quality had greatly improved.  So I bought a Groupon and we finally used it tonight.  What an improvement!   We were seated immediately by a friendly and smiling hostess.  The server welcomed us after we had been seated about two minutes.  It seemed that it took a long time to receive our burgers, however they were cooked to perfection.  The quality of the meat was outstanding, the mac and cheese side was generous, and the fries were hot and crisp.  The manager, John, stopped at our table to make sure we were happy.   We absolutely were happy and will return soon.  The new and improved Whiskey Rose was fun, reasonably priced and served quality food!"}
{"text":"Don't go in the late afternoon. This place is a bust. Had a groupon. Ordered wings and the brisket. Seems like regulars get treated way better than new customers. Wasn't checked up on once. Wings arrived about 12 minutes after I ordered them. The skin on the wings were soggy and they were cold. I ate 1 of them and was still charged for them. Didn't offer to take it off bill or to try something different. Brisket is not so great but the Mac n chews was alright. Nothing was hot though. All in all the service was not good and the food wasn't too good either."}
{"text":"First time their and the wait was normal. The hamburger that I ordered was to tall to eat so I cut it in half. The onion rings were very big. The cornbread my wife ate wasn't fresh."}
{"text":"We had been meaning to try this place since it opened but were frankly a bit dismayed by the poor yelp reviews. We ended up buying a Groupon and finally tried this place on a Friday night. We were quite impressed and mad at ourselves for not trying it earlier! 

Atmosphere: The place looks like a friendly country western restaurant/bar. I almost expected peanuts or sawdust on the ground. TVs everywhere playing sports and music ranging from country to rock. Guitars on the walls, an American flag, neon and metal beer signs. Tasteful, casual, family friendly. 

Service: Hostess was friendly and we were seated almost immediately even though the place seemed fairly busy. Our waitress was pretty good: polite, helpful, never let our drinks go dry, etc. 

Food: We were pleasantly surprised by the food. Ordered the sampler appetizer with potato skins, corn fritters (yum!), wings (pretty good), and fried pickles (my favorite). We got a mac and cheese kids meal (not the best ever, but not that nasty Kraft stuff either) and a 1/4 rack of ribs for the other kid. This was A LOT of ribs for a kids meal. And they were good! Since they were so good, we ordered the adult portion of ribs (again, a lot of food) and also the BLT (tons and tons of bacon and wasn't a greasy sandwich!). We tried the onion rings, green beans and sweet potato fries as sides - all good. Overall we liked everything a lot and will likely order a very similar meal next time. 

Tip: Kids meals are free with adult entrees after 4 pm on weeknights. The kids ribs meal is a steal! A great deal even if you have to pay $5. 

We are adding this place to our regular list!"}
{"text":"Yuck stay away! Everything we had from the wings to the burgers tasted like it had been frozen. It took 10 minutes to get one drink and didn't get a second drink or see the waitress until we were done with dinner. How they stay in business is beyond me. Drive by just drive by!!"}
{"text":"I just got done eating at this restaurant. We order a lot of different dishes in order to taste the food, and overall, it was very good food!  the corn fritters were perfect! Just the right amount of sweetness and one can tell they clean the oil in their fryers because they tasted fresh. I loved the mac & Cheese balls and since I have never had them I had nothing to compare to. They were crispy, warm and full of flavor.  Then I tried the hot links, very good as well. Nothing to change there. The cole slaw though needs a lighter sauce, but the flavor of the veggies was good. The Brisk sandwich was great too, perhaps needs more smoking to it.  The pull pork sandwich was great too, moist.  Now the BBQ sause to me was off the charts!  Good work!  The stuff pork mushrooms were the only marginal item that wasn't a big hit on our table.  Something about the mushrooms and BBQ sauce doesn't mix well...or perhaps the pork.  Finally we had some jalepanos wrapped in bacon!  WOW, they were a bit too mild for me, but I like hot stuff!  They were original and very good!  There is one problem, they serve Pepsi!!!!!  C'mon guys get the Coke in there!!!!  I loved my first experience."}
{"text":"I hate to write a bad review but this is one place that deserves a 1 star rating.

To start I walked in and the host was standing with her back to us, coloring on a kids page, It took her co-worker to walk around and notice we were there and that she couldn't hear us saying anything to her.

We came on a night that had live music. Great for the kids and it was a good bad. However we sat in the dining area, at our table there was no way to have a conversation because the music was so loud you had to scream to talk to the person across from you. 

Servers left a lot to be desired. My first thought were these were the servers who didn't get picked at other places so they ended up here. Their dress while might be cute for the right body type, instead just looked trashy and unkept. They come to the table about once ever 2 minutes asking if everything is ok, if it is you can say yes, if it is not they can't hear you to get it fixed.

Food, this is where it gets awful. Keep in mind I love Whiskey, the taste and cooking with it myself. However this place has taken Whiskey over to over kill. Our nachos tasted like it, the beans, the bbq, the mac and cheese, no matter what I tried it all had a Whiskey flavor. It was very sad, you can cook with Whiskey but there becomes a point of over kill. My kids got the mac and cheese, and when you have two kids who love mac and cheese slide it back after a bite you have to wonder. We had to wonder my wife tried it, and found it to be dried out and hard, and no flavor at all.

The server brought us the check asked if it was all good, I made a comment about how it was she laughed took my card and ran it. About 15 minutes later she came back dropped off the bill and kept on walking. No manager came by or anything. We left minimal tip 15% and left. This is not a place I would recommend going to. 

They have stiff competition in the area with a Zipps open now by them, Garcia's and heck Panda Express is much better. 

Don't waste your money to go here."}
{"text":"I've come here a few tea in the past and loved it! I went tonight and was not happy with the food. For $18 I got tasteless tough ribs and a small ice cream scoop of cold mashed potatoes. The corn bread which is usually a favorite now has green chilies which was not good. What happened to good ole fashioned corn bread? The BBQ sauce also was different, tangy or something, just not good. I will be surprised if this place stays open another year. So sad :("}
{"text":"I hate to give this place a bad review but I really have no choice.  I'll start with the positive.  The beer was good.  Now to the not so positive.  The food we got was less then favorable.  I asked our server what was good or what their thing was and she suggested the cod (which i don't really eat fish at these kind of spots) or a burger of some sort. Anyhow, nothing looked great so we had a few apps and my wife got a pizza.  The pizza was down right terrible. Our friends got a burger and it was average at best.  My hummus app was not bad.  I guess the thing is the whole menu was bar food?  Anyhow when the mgr came over to ask how it was we had a candid conversation about it so he said their bar b q food was \"their thing\".  My friends say its a one an done but I'll give it one more try and listen to the mgr suggestions."}
{"text":"I've been going here for a while and the service keeps getting worse. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I honestly don't see where the complaints for this place are coming from. Just randomly stopped by on my way home and though we had to wait a few seconds to get seated by the hostess, she was very friendly. Our waitress came to us right away, dressed in a tank top and cowboy boots, was too friendly. There were a few tables seated and she was the only waitress on the floor... But she made sure every table was attended to and was polite in every way. Our meals came out, which we thoroughly enjoyed, asked for a side of jalepenos which she happily brought out for us free of charge. It's sad to see these harsh reviews on here. I'm glad I gave it a chance and stopped by!"}
{"text":"Loved the country music, atmosphere and great service.   Hunter was super nice and attentive as our server.  Food was pretty good.   Fried picked were a good appetizer.  I'd try it again :)"}
{"text":"We've been here twice, which is enough for me.

Our first dining experience was after they'd been opened about a month.  We were very encouraged as the restaurant was full and there was a bit of a wait.  We saddled up to the bar for a round of beers (the choices are plentiful, but premium beers aren't included in the Happy Hour prices).  Once seated, we perused the menu and opted to try to fried macaroni and cheese, plus fried pickles for appetizers.  The mac and cheese was b-o-r-i-n-g and lacking in flavor.  The fried pickles fared better with a zippy horseradish dipping sauce.

We decided to spit a full rack of ribs.  They arrived at our table so completely overcooked that there were black on the bottom and dry as a piece of wood that's been sitting in the 115 degree heat in the middle of the desert for 3 years.  (Trying to cover the charred meat with BBQ sauce didn't cut it)  We told the waitress who told the cooks (I don't think anyone here would qualify as a chef).  She offered to bring us another order.  Since we'd waited awhile for the first order, we opted out.  The manager popped by to inquire how everything was....he wasn't happy and said \"they're burning everything in there tonight.  These shouldn't have come out of the kitchen\".  True that!  He comped our bill (I always love that - we couldn't eat the food so why should we pay?) and offered us $10 off our next visit.

We hit them up again; shorter wait, still no bargains on premium beer during Happy Hour and upon ordering the fried pickles, we were told \"We are out of pickles.\"  How does a restaurant run out of an item that is a standard on their menu??  Poor management!  The poppers sounded great (stuffed with chopped brisket) and wrapped in a piece of bacon.  The mess in the middle was just nasty! Our waitress came back at least 5 times asking us if we were ready to order and each time we said \"No, we're in no hurry.\"   We kind of got the feeling they like to move 'em in and move 'em out!   Two of us ordered salads - both very standard and nothing to brag about.  My hubby ordered their chili mac and cheese which he said was pretty good.  My friend tried the ribs again and the regular mac and cheese.  I didn't hear any rave reviews - good enough for me.

The waitress came by once to ask if they could take our wine glasses back because they were out of glasses.  Are you kidding me??   Ever heard of a restaurant supply store and buying more than 2 dozen?

Sorry Whiskey Rose....those of us who are true foodies can't handle it.  Joe's BBQ isn't that far away and they never fail!"}
{"text":"This was ok. Went for lunch on Saturday. The Mac and cheese was great.  Not sure if I would go back again at least not for lunch. I might come check out the place at night."}
{"text":"Wow, how things have changed... I gave a tip on this place 2 years ago, when (post tense) we really enjoyed our dinner. Went back tonight - for the last time. Don't waste your time or money, this place BLOWS. The food was average, at best. Some of it was awful - the mac and cheese (what used to be a highlight) is now probably the worst we've ordered. And we ordered 2 different types (side dish and southwest-style entree).

Not only was the food about an hour wait - with a near empty restaurant (4 other tables in addition to us, none very big). The side of Mac tasted like rancid cheddar cheese - - the entree Mac my wife ordered was wrong. It was supposed to have pulled pork in it, and none came with the plate. When my wife pointed that out, our server actually argued that we were mistaken on what the entree was. We made her get a menu and showed here the description that includes 'pulled pork' on the mac. Only then did she agree to take the dish back. one of two beer-battered cod fillets was ok, the other was completely under-cooked mush. 

i hate to see a good restaurant go bad or even worse to see one of our neighborhood places close, but this needs a complete overhaul - and until it does we will not return."}
{"text":"Four of us went there to watch football. The games were on, but music was playing, so watching the game was not much fun. 

I had a $3 Sunday special bloody mary. Meh. Weak on the vodka, and the bloody mary mix just didn't taste right. 

Food: I had the \"fall off the bone\" pork ribs. Fall off the bone they did, but the reason why was that they were boiled to death, then browned in an oven and dunked in sauce. Was more like eating pot roast with bones in it. Awful. 

The onion rings were just so so, same for the chili mac & cheese. 

I guess the warning was evident when we walked in and the place was not very busy. 

Sorry...this is a \"one and done\" for me."}
{"text":"Parking lot full, wife & I decided to try. Well lit parking lot, greeter welcomed us with smile & sat us down, Food-(A) wide selection.   Atmosphere-(A) western feel.  Cleanliness-(A) checked both bathrooms.    Noise level-(B) (very busy with live band).   Service-(A) Great service from Alley.  Very wide beer selection, 35-40 choices, loved her \"Magic Cat\" beer recommendation. 

Wife, the healthy one, had spinach pizza, loved it, uncooked spinach, with goat cheese, herbs, balsamic dribbled. She had glass of 14 Hands wine, WA wine and loved it. Crust tasted good too!

Myself, Salmon plate, wonderful, moist, get choice 2 sides, house salad, mixed, was normal with dressing on side, potato baked, all was good

Wide assortment of apps, we had the hummus, was really good with warm pita bread, they give you 3 flavors of the hummus, loved the spicier one, we cleaned it up after ordering more warm pita

3 dessert choices, we had the brownie, wow! Warm, moist, vanilla ice cream melting over hot brownie! Wife had server hold off the optional whipped cream...

Danced to the band, Rattlecat Junction, good country mix, plus happy birthday song and \"used to be My Girl\", great time!

Left full and satisfied, will be back often,

PS... Parking lot was still full when we left, the honest measuring stick..."}
{"text":"Used to have great service, and super food when previous mgmt were there up to the summer 2014.... since then the service and food has gone downhill
I had dinner there Oct 12 and the Cobb salad was very bland. The chicken was cold and very dry... I liked the previous mgmt who were very professional and ensured quality food. Now the management is non-existent and the place has lost its appeal. Food and service is subpar. Wont be going back..

{"text":"Visiting my aunt, she said this place was good so we came for dinner.  I got the filet, she got the chili and cornbread.  I asked for my steak to be cooked medium and it came out perfectly cooked. My son got mac n cheese, he liked it (he's 2yrs) my husband said the chili was great, especially on the cold night.  Two thumbs up"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews here I hesitated to try this place. Hoping that many of the issues would have been resolved once they had been up and running for a couple of months we decided to give it a try when we saw a Groupon. We were greeted and seated immediately upon arrival and our server appeared promptly, off to a good start. I asked about beers on tap and our server produced a mis-spelled, typed list while stating \"I am not supposed to show you this\" - odd but okay, I don't mind reading the choices - the beer on tap list is extensive. He tells us that beers are $3 for the happy hour special but that if we are using a Groupon we will need to be sure to buy at least $20 worth of non-discounted foods as the Groupon cannot be applied to the discounted beer. No problem, with two entrees we will be over the $20 threshold easily.  Ordered the BBQ brisket entree, hubby ordered the breakfast burger. Brisket was tasty, nothing special but nicely cooked. The breakfast burger is a large sausage patty topped with a fried egg. Unfortunately the sausage patty was still pink inside - undercooked sausage is not appealing, nor safe to eat. Overall not a wonderful experience but not the disaster many previous reviewers made it out to be. Our server was friendly and attentive. My biggest complaint is that when the bill came I was charged full price for the beer. Our server was quick to correct the error when we pointed it out but I found it annoying and interesting that a previous reviewer mentioned the same issue of being offered a happy hour special but then charged full price when the bill arrived.  No live music was playing while we were there so I can't offer any opinion on the entertainment. The physical layout was pretty much the same as the Old Chicago that was previously here with the addition of some rough wood and American Flag decor."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the Whiskey Rose Saloon.  The atmosphere and music are awesome.  We had the Whiskey Rose Torpedoes which were great and tried several variations of burgers with rave reviews.  The prices were good with happy hour, a yelp coupon, and a free beer they were offering.  We all had a great time!"}
{"text":"Have been here twice.  Food was good and prices were acceptable.  Waitress was so far off her game...slow slow slow. Once food order got turned in food was served by kitchen staff immediately.  So first visit good second was ok.  I guess I need another visit to see my final opinion."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! The food here is amazing. I had the Santa Fe burger and the Mac n' cheese. They have a large selection of draft beers, which is always a plus! 

I love the atmosphere and country music. It looks like they have live bands on Friday and Saturday nights. I am going to have to come back one of these nights!"}
{"text":"Three stars very accurate for this place.

 Everything was pretty much average but it did have a pretty good beer selection.

We went for lunch and there was one server for the entire restaurant.

Santa Fe burger. Not bad but nothing to write home about. The Green Chile is def very mild and the burger was fairly small for a $12 burger

Rib Tips: Not bad!

Jalapeno poppers: This left us flat. Jalapenos are so good when stuffed with Chream Cheese but these guys stuff it with pretty bland pulled pork. They do wrap it in bacon which was good but overall its just average."}
{"text":"Good food. Large portions. Big menu with lots of choices. I got buffalo chicken sandwich and fries. They were really good. Fries are crispy and seasoned. Got potato skins for appetizer. They were good, but different than typical skins. They could be a meal filled with chilly, cheese, chives, and sour cream. Waiter was prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"Service was excellent. Thst's the best thing I can say. Food is below average with nothing made there. Music was not that good and we left after 2 songs. Won't return anytime soon."}
{"text":"The first few times my husband and I ate here shortly after it opened, I was bothered by the fact they only employed females who wore low cut tank tops and were covered in tattoos. Call me old fashioned but that was unappetizing. My husband convinced me to try again and I'm happy to report there are now men working here too and everyone is adequately covered! And the food is great too."}
{"text":"We came here for an early dinner and ordered fried pickles and the bacon wrapped filet. The food was mediocre and pretty tasteless. The best thing there was the cornbread. We were stoked to receive a free app with yelp check-in but our waitress forgot to take it off our bill. While our food came out, we noticed a hoard of flies all over the restaurant and attacking our food. We were so disgusted that we packed up our food and left. They were nice and discounted our meal at 20% off but we will not be returning. Food was awful and the flies ruined the mood."}
{"text":"Great \"saloon\" style.  I decided to give this joint a try Friday afternoon.  I liked the feel of the updated saloon with electric guitars on the walls and plenty of tvs in the bar.  Even though country music isn't my first listening choice, I liked all the newer country jams that played in the background, while we ate.
For food, I went out on a limb and tried the fried pickles, surprisingly good.  We shared a pulled pork bbq sandwich and a salad with grilled chicken.  Enjoyed it all.
I will definitely be back on a Fri/Sat night for live music.  Might even dig out my cowboy hat & huge belt buckle and come-in-hot \"Urban Cowboy\"-style!
Liked this place!  Something different."}
{"text":"Great food, okay service... Corn fritters are to die for as are the pulled pork sandwiches, always tender and delicious! Although the food is good, service was ehh... Starting the order I informed the server about our free appetizer as we checked in on Yelp! She replied with a sarcastic tone and moved on. In addition she sat with staff within ten feet of our table having personal conversation. When the bill then came out our free appetizer had not been deducted and we didn't care enough to change it.... Oh well."}
{"text":"Have been here several times trying to give it \"another shot\" because we live close and we like to go there before football games however tonight will most likely be our last time going. Service is ALWAYS Crazy slow, there is a very small selection of food on the menu and no matter how hard they try, it always seems some part of our order gets messed up or is cold by the time it gets to out table.  It's a bummer- I would like to see it succeed but there will have to be some big changes with how it's managed before it gets our $$ again."}
{"text":"My first and surely won't be my last time going they were busy however beyond friendly we were assisted with opinions on food drinks etc"}
{"text":"We have been there a couple times recently. Once it was packed with only bar seating open. I was puzzled as to why they didn't open up the back section. The food was good for bar food. I had the chicken wings. They were alright for a place that doesn't specialize in wings. They have a nice selection of draft beer. I like the mason jar beer mugs. The night we went they had karaoke. Great sound system and virtually unlimited song choice. We will return again, but not on a regular basis as we are 22 miles away."}
{"text":"Very nice 'Western' bar and grill. The food was good and the happier was inexpensive.  Their portions are large as well.  If you are hungry and want to find a cool watering hole, try this place.  I will be back several more times for sure!"}
{"text":"OK..Two 5 star reviews with way to much detail.  Nice to have good friends in the restaurant business!

Let me start off by saying at least my server was nice.

When I saw a place going in at the Old Chicago building I was happy.  My area needed a decent sit down place.  Then when I became friends with them on Facebook I was even more happy.  They stated that they were going to have lots of craft beer on tap.  EVEN BETTER.

Well after 3 weeks or so of being open the wife and I decided to give the place a try for happy hour.  Ummmmmmmm.....Ok, so the place looks like Old Chicago with a nice paint job and bit more country to it.  I have no problem with that. So off to the bar we go to get some craft beer.  Well Out of something like 20 taps they waste 1/2 of them doubling up on Bud, Bud Light, Coors, Light, Miller Light, Mich Ultra and Blue Moon.  WHAT?  16 taps of the same crappy beer?  Yes I know the excuse will be speed when they are busy, but come on 16 taps of the worst beers you can have?  The remaining taps had a few San Tan's a Guinness, the new Apple Orchard Craze and a Grand Canyon and I am sure a few more that I forgot to name. WHOOPIE.  I can get San Tan up the road about 2 blocks (with far better food, that part is coming).  So right off the bat not a good vibe.  

So they have this great happy hour, 1/2 off apps.  I love it.  As I am drinking my Sex Panther (well it sure as hell ain't going to be a Coors Light) we decide on Fried Pickles and Rib Tips.  Our waitress (Again the bright spot of the eve) informed us that they had a 5 star chef doing the cooking!  Sounds great.

Well the pickles came out and they were OK.  The dipping sauce after a few minutes began to get a film over top of it.  So my wife asked for ranch dressing.  After about 10 minutes of waiting for the manger to bring it, we asked the bar back and he brought it right over.  Honestly, the WORST ranch dressing I have ever tasted in my life, it actually tasted fishy.  

On to the rib tips.  Our first order came and I bit into it, not even luke warm.  The bartender asks how they were we said not really hot, so back they went.  This time the manager brings them out and...not even luke warm again.  5 star chef must have the night off.  So now our bar back notices were not eating them and asks whats up and we tell them this is the second time they are not hot.  So back they go and literally 2 minutes later back they come.  Watch out the top plate is hot he tells us.  Yes of course it is as you just microwaved my food.  

Not going well.  Still hungry we decided (why I don't know) to order some more food.  My wife went with the Mac & Cheese and I went with some wings.  The mac and cheese was the winner of the night, decent, but needed seasoning.  The wing's I got were 1/2 Daytona Buffalo wings and 1/2 Garlic Parmesan Wings.  The Daytona wings is a mixture of Buffalo sauce and BBQ sauce.  They were fine, not great not horrible, but as a person who LOVES wings not ones I would get again. Oh by the way, not hot again, just warm.   As far as these other things, THE WORST I EVER TASTED.  First the sauce was this white milky substance that looked like as my wife put it, the chef had a \"party\" on your wings.  GROSS.  But like the trooper I am I tasted them.  No flavor, none, nada zip.  No garlic, no cheese just this white milky goo.  PASS one and done.

I really wanted to like this place, I want our neighborhood to get some good joints with decent food.  Not this time.  

Thankfully Zipps will be opening soon!"}
{"text":"A groupon made me aware of this establishment. . The waitress was friendly and happy. Good bar food and burgers are great. The humus appetizers were a nice surprise and tasty. Good beer selection.. Will be back and try the brisket. Nice county flair and  kind wait staff and managers."}
