{"text":"Atmosfera is right next to the hotel I generally stay at while I'm in Mississauga. It was completely empty at 915 on a Monday evening. I was greeted warmly. I had a couple of drinks, a soup, and salad. The soup was very good. It was the pasta fagiole and the portion size and ratio of stuff-to-stock was great. They offered fresh bread as well. The salad was the Italian and had a prosciutto  slice, tuna, eggs, mixed greens, and olives.   The eggs were overboiled and I asked for the dressing on the side but it came on top. Other than that, it was good for a Monday night after a long day of working. I'll be back for a proper dinner, I'm sure."}
{"text":"My brother and I paid a LOT of money for two pasta dishes while on travel here: a mediocre penne arabiatta and a funky, unhygienic linguine pollo y fungi. The latter dish actually came out tasting like it was spoiled. I generally would let it go, but I feel that for a restaurant that charges such high prices, this is really unacceptable. My dish wasn't even safe to eat.   I will be calling this restaurant to get my money back. In the interim, I would warn others to be careful and avoid this place."}
{"text":"The food was very good, but the see ice was a bit slow.  Wait staff as very friendly.  If you have time this is a great place to eat."}
{"text":"This nightclub/restaurant which adjoins the Staybridge Suites on Hurontario, seems to function reasonably well as the former and not at all in the latter category.    A Friday night found a pretty chilled environment with two DJs who, although they had enabled the \"AUTOMIX\" function on their Ableton Live software, picked the right tracks to keep the smallish crowd dancing.  Drinks were good, if a little pricey.  Service was slow and pretty much devoid of even the most basic of pleasantries.  The true nightmare comes to the food portion.  If you go DO NOT ORDER FOOD.  No, it's not the worst food ever - but every single dish was just - off.  As in - not at all right.  Not bold choices by a chef, rather someone with ADD flipping the pages on \"Cooking for Dummies\" waaaay too fast.    If you do go, eat first - you'll thank me."}
{"text":"Ordered carry out as I was next door at the hotel. Did several stone cooked pizzas & a caprese salad. Decently value for the money. At least the crust was crispy and the middle was soft. Lil excess flour under the one pizza. But it was slightly above avg. Im from Chicago and I know pizza. Ive had far worse than this. It was decent. Slightly disappointing on the salad. Thrown together, tomatoes werent sliced. Mushrooms were ok. Not much salad on the salad & heavy on the dressing. All in all the meal was slightly above avg say 5 1/2 or 6 out of 10. We did like the fresh bread accompanying the salad"}
{"text":"I usually order from this place all the time. They're a little bit on the pricey side but the food and customer service makes up for that. I ordered a soup a few weeks ago and the portion was half the size for the same price! I thought, this can't be right, so I went back to the restaurant and they gave me the proper portion.   Today, I ordered the lobster ravioli which I've had before many times. The second picture is what I was given. The restaurant has cut down on Howe portions and prices remain the same! Not good! I paid $21 dollar for six pieces of ravioli...so not worth it. And I left a tip! I was extremely disappointed with this meal and the restaurant for charging such obscene prices for such a small portion. The food itself is good but it's not worth it. After 5 years of going to this restaurant, it's saddens me because today was my last day going back there. Never eating there again simply because the food given is not worth it. You're better off spending your buck else where to get an actually filling meal"}
{"text":"Same person serves as hostess, server, bartender, bus boy (and maybe chef?) so service was slow even with less then 8 people in the entire place. Decor was nice, didn't bother to eat - just drank - at the suggestion of an earlier post.  Drinks were strong!  If I weren't staying in the hotel next door, I am certain there'd be no reason for me to ever come to this place. I expected Gordon Ramsey to enter at any moment for a Kitchen Nightmare episode. Place needs a refresh."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, decent food and thats about it. Food came on time, but we waited almost an hour for the bill. Finally when the bill did come through, they messed up the bill twice. Then the manager or owner, decides to come to our table and very rudely ask \"What's the problem?\" Would never recommend or come back here again."}
{"text":"Great food, great wine and beautiful decor!  A nice surprise from looking at the outside.  Highly recommend!  Tried the house Soave wine!  Wonderful.  Parmesan gnocchi were very flavorful!"}
{"text":"There is no reason this place should have such low starrage here! We ate dinner while visiting the area an it was extremely good!  Patrick was our waiter and he was so friendly and helpful. We got there shortly after they opened and he made us feel warm and welcome.   We started with garlic bread and mussels (in a red sauce with saut√©ed tomatoes) and it was delicious. Patrick even brought us extra bread just for dipping.   For our main dinner I had the lobster ravioli and my husband had the lemon chicken. My ravioli was perfect, served in an amazing cream sauce and so delicious I ate every bite. My husband enjoyed his chicken tremendously, and we even tried a bit of each others' food - I thought the chicken was super tasty and tender and hubby said my ravioli was excellent (and he's not often really a ravioli guy).  We had nothing but a good experience. The ambience was what I'd call romantic and inviting, and dressy if you want it to be (but we didn't feel underdressed being casual either). The service was superb and the food didn't disappoint. If we lived here in the area, we'd for-sure go back!"}
