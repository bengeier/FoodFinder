{"text":"I live near here and this has definitely become my go-to spot for breakfast, lunch, or just to sit and read for a couple hours.   The food is quite good - I am yet to have anything that has disappointed.   I am particularly attached to their vegetarian breakfast sandwich, though I've heard the carnivore version isn't too shabby either.

For the drinks, I just drink black coffee, so can't comment on the rest, but have always been happy with the selection.   Furthermore, contrary to some other posters, I've always had superior experiences with the baristas and waitstaff, but who knows, you can do alot with small sample sizes.   

My only complaint is that I wish they were open later.   There's not alot of other spots in the neighborhood to just hangout at past 6pm.

Oh, and try the scones.   Don't be a scone hater!"}
{"text":"I can't figure out why it took me so long to make my way to Manna. Probably because I  never really ventured to the North Side. What a mistake!
Now Manna is one of my favorite breakfast/brunch places when my family comes to visit. There are a lot of extremely tasty options no matter what you desire for your early morning chowing. Sweet? They got it. Savory? They got it. You can also find seating and you don't feel like you need to eat and run like at some other brunch spots."}
{"text":"Since the last Ovens of Brittany closed in 2000, my wife and I have been searching for a place to get morning buns.  Needless to say, we were delighted when we discovered that Manna Cafe's sticky buns look and taste just like Ovens' morning buns!  Simply heavenly.  Their muffins, especially the berry streusel, have also become a favorite of ours.  If you're dining in, you'll find their baked goods nicely complemented by a bottomless cup of Johnson Brothers' coffee."}
{"text":"I've been to Manna Cafe twice... Both times the service has been apallingly slow.  Just today I waited 30 minutes... While my breakfast companion was 2/3 through his meal I finally went up to inquire how much longer I would need to wait for my meal.  The woman behind the counter asked me what I had ordered.  When I told her, she turned around and picked up a plate that had been sitting on the back counter.  Oh... This must be it... Somehow the table numbers got mixed up.  I returned to my table with my breakfast... Now tepid... And ate it while grumbling to my companion about the crappy service.  I was offered a free dessert to take home as compensation... Which I passed on.  I go out to breakfast because it is relaxing and enjoyable.  My experience at Manna has been less than satisfactory.  There are many places in Madison that have food equal to or better than Manna Cafe... And service that doesn't leave me tense and fuming.  I will not be returning again."}
{"text":"Manna Cafe & Bakery offers a great and tasty variety of sandwiches, bakery items, pastries and drinks, especially for vegetarians. Unfortunately, it's usually busy (hopefully they'll expand!) but service is always prompt and friendly. Some of the food is a little pricey and may add up fast, but it's always delicious."}
{"text":"My wife and I mostly go here a little after the lunch rush for coffee and goodies.  We love hanging around back by the fireplace when we can grab those seats.  I feel bad for all those folks who have to deal with crowds and waits and rushed service - we totally avoid that whole thing, so my reviews are much more relaxed than others' might be.

Their drip coffee is good and they are pretty good about keeping the canisters of fresh drip coffee coming.  Their bakery is very good - I really like the morning buns and the cinnamon-oat-date scones.  My wife swears by their gluten-free cookies, and I can say, having had more than a few bites myself, they pretty much just taste like regular cookies to me.  I've never had a bad baked item of theirs, as a matter of fact."}
{"text":"Great brunch menu...good portion sizes, yummy bakery treats and a great latte.  I look forward to trying other menu items in the bear future!"}
{"text":"Checked out Manna while in Madison for Easter and we needed a place for a good brunch. The atmosphere was very laid back and coffee shop like. I tried the eggs benedict and sticky bun french toast. I thought the eggs benedict was great, especially with the avocado, tomato & bacon! The sticky bun french toast was a little too doughy/undercooked for me, although others in my group enjoyed it and/or had more well done versions. Overall, I thought this place had decent breakfast food."}
{"text":"I work nearby so I am definitely grateful that Manna is around. Not many lunch options in this neighborhood!  Most of their menu choices are relatively healthy, made from fresh, unprocessed and sometimes even local foods. Their menu is extensive, with a variety of soups, salads and sandwiches. I've yet to try something I didn't like. I love the Country Turkey Salad, and I've had many great sandwiches as well. 

While I live downtown, I also occasionally head to Manna for Sunday brunch. The oatmeal pancakes are great. Definitely worth driving a few extra miles. 

Service is good, it can sometimes take a while to get the food but that's understandable given how busy they are at lunch time. My only complaint is that they rarely pick up the phone when I try to call in a pickup order. Overall, an amazing option in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Great food!! We got sweet manna Omelette! We went their for the first time today to try something new... loved it! We will be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"We are from NY and visited this place for breakfast and think it could be our most favorite breakfast place ever.  Our group had eggs, pancakes and omelets and everything was exceptional.  The coffee is great too."}
{"text":"Really good quiche! Fluffy and (somewhat) light for quiche, while still not skimping on the fillings-- I had the turkey, spinach, and Gruyere. Delicious. 

The oatmeal pancakes were all right, nothing special like I had read, but if I return, I'd again opt for a quiche and some of their delicious coffee. They have specialty drinks as well as bottomless for $2.90. 

Nice location with a parking lot. Interior is cozy and usually you can find a table to sit at. I also like how friendly the service is. It's refreshing that they can take their time to help folks make a decision if they can't make one (as the two people in front of me did)."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Thursday mid morning. There is a wide variety to choose from on the menu, and everything sounds delicious. I settled on the \"Morning After Burrito\". It was very good and the side of grilled pineapple was an added treat. I can't wait to come back and try something else!"}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is fabulous. My favorites are the chicken salad sandwich and the tuna melt. Breakfast is great too, especially the oatmeal pancakes. Great place to grab a quick bite, meet friends for coffee (all fair trade), or sit and read."}
{"text":"Manna always served up delicious, affordable brunch, lunch, and bakery. Plus it has great authentic Jewish treats like bialys and hamentaschen! 

I've been coming here for years and probably have an extra 10 lbs because of it... Rustic fruit tarts, quiche, and oatmeal pancakes. You will not be disappointed! 

Bonus points? Lots of local, organic, and fair trade food. Champagne! And ample parking. Why go anywhere else?!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breakfast and lunch places. The environment is cozy and comfortable but get there early or you will be waiting for a seat.  My favorites are the quiche and soups but so far I haven't found a single item I didn't like. They have great salads and sandwiches as well as a hearty steak chili. Yum yum yum!"}
{"text":"Pretty meh. They have a big selection and I have tried several things. Nothing really made me too excited. I did like the chili quite a bit though."}
{"text":"Great bake goods, the ginger cookies with icing are the best I have ever had and the apricot scones are another one of my favorites. Weekend breakfast is busy but the take out bakery is always quick and fresh. If you can take the time for breakfast, they are worth the wait and the counter service is quick. You get to place your order as soon as you arrive and not wait until a busy waiter may see you."}
{"text":"A local friend brought us here when we passed through Madison.  We had the brisket sandwich special, the vegetarian Monty Python, the Mediterranean platter, a rustic cherry tart, and a peanut butter layered cookie.  Everything was remarkably good, and I would love to go again!"}
{"text":"The wait is not worth it.  Over an hour and fifteen minutes for an egg sandwich.  The system needs to change.  You order, wait for a seat, then wait at the table for the food.   When first entertaining we asked if this was unusually busy and they stated no not at all.   Make a change"}
{"text":"Amazing, warm and cozy! Artichoke and 4 cheese quiche was special of the day and was the best quiche I've ever had. Sticky buns rock too. This is a must every year when we visit madison."}
{"text":"This has fast become one of my favorite places to eat in Madison. I was willing to give it a try with some friends one Saturday afternoon, and it blew me away. They have delicious vegetarian fare, as well as a scrumptious-looking carnivorous menu. Everything I've had--from baked goods, to sandwiches, to drinks--has been extremely well done. Their pairing of ingredients for sandwiches is spot-on, and their homemade bread takes it to the next level of excellence. I cant leave without a sweet from their case--they're always different, and always top notch. I have yet to go for breakfast, but expect it's just as delicious. A must-try if you're in or around Madison."}
{"text":"Having heard good things about this bakery, I went there today to order some dessert bars for a party. I explained to the clerk I had never been there and had some questions about their bars. He was very helpful and answered my 3-4 questions. He then offered me samples, which is good business. I tasted the lemon bars and peanut butter/brownie bars, they were superb. I ordered 3 dozen to be picked up on Thursday. I also needed some bread for the party and ordered 3 loaves. The clerk gave me a discount for the large order. A very positive experience."}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere is excellant. Eggs benedict was fantastic. Was offended by anti Walker sign posted on there wall. Political comments should not be posted in a public establishment."}
{"text":"This has to be my favorite breakfast and lunch cafe. Their oatmeal pancakes are amazing and I get cravings for them every month. The sandwich and salad menu are filled with awesome choices - I'm trying to get through everything on the menu. It's a solid, reliable place! And, while it may appear busy, and even be completely full at times, if you have a little bit of patience, you will get a table before your food arrives. Also, despite what some have said, the servers are completely friendly. If I worked closer, I would definitely be here every week."}
{"text":"Delicious roasted vegetable salad and Earthy Delights sandwich. Many creative menu selections. Lots of comfy seating, Friendly staff. I would come more often if I knew they were buying from local sources...was disappointed to see that the butter came from Minnesota, What's up with that?"}
{"text":"Consistently good food, interesting varied menu, good staff.  The food is really wonderful for breakfast, brunch, soup, etc. You can tell that taste AND presentation are both important to them. Also, their breads and pastries are beautiful to look at and eat.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Best Quiche I have had anywhere, including France!  Their breakfast burrito (which is a breakfast item I usually am not a fan of) is also one of my favorites.  The lunch specials are always incredible and don't get me started on the sweet treats, they are amazing. Love sitting by the fireplace on cool days too.  Great food served by wonderful warm staff in a cozy atmosphere.  Thank you Manna!"}
{"text":"A wonderful discovery on the Northeast side. Don't let the stripmall exterior fool you. This place works hard to deliver a cozy atmosphere and a solid breakfast. The coffee's good, the bakery's good, and I love the egg sandwiches. They have counter service, so know what you're ordering before you get in line. Some of the decorations and the fireplace almost push Manna to the point of too cute, but it's a welcome departure from most of my favorite breakfast haunts."}
{"text":"Located in a modest mini-mall on Madison's east side, Manna is a hidden find for anyone craving cafe-style breakfast and brunch.  Choose from omelette and egg dishes, pancakes, quiche, baked goods, or a number of other items.  Order at the counter and find a seat, but be prepared to hover and attack a table amongst the weekend masses.  A tip: there are multiple cash registers, so don't get stuck waiting in the (usually longest) line near the door."}
{"text":"The oatmeal pancakes are delicious (I ordered mine with chocolate chips in them - yum!).  However, the process of ordering and seating yourself is a bit stressful on a busy weekend.  For a first timer, it's not entirely clear where to go to order (you stand in line to place your order at the cash registers in the front and pay before you eat), how the seating process works (you battle it out with all the other people who already placed an order to get the next available table and steal chairs from wherever you can find them), or if you need to bus your own tables (you do).  While I enjoyed the food, I think it has only encouraged me to make oatmeal pancakes at home, where I am always seated before ordering."}
{"text":"Had veggie  eggs Benedict today...so delicious!!!  Freshest English  muffin.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Good food and atmosphere. Great for breakfast."}
{"text":"Get the quiche. Get the quiche. Get the quiche. 
I thought I knew what well prepared quiche tastes like, then I found myself at Manna on a rainy Friday morning. It melts in your mouth like a good piece of chocolate with just enough light crisp on top to keep you coming back for another bite. I'd go out of my way for this alone. 
Bottomless coffee was a fair $2.50 and the walnut poppy seed rugelach was worth it too."}
{"text":"Manna Cafe has long been my favorite brunch spot, well worth the trip across The Isthmus, but now that I have discovered their super fine evening menu, I am eager to return.  Is this the best kept secret in town?   Three of us (two with birthdays) dined leisurely, in an amazingly quiet atmosphere, and were spoiled to the max by a delightful wait person, named Brandon.  We started with a shared bottle of pinot grigio and a flat bread app.  Yummy.  Then I had Jerusalem Sliders, which were divine.    Don't recall what my friends ordered, but they were equally delighted and determined to get back soon."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in my experience today. Arrived at 11:00, it was a 45 minute kitchen wait. We ordered our food and waited for our table. We were seated in 45 minutes and waited and waited and waited. An hour and 20 minutes later, still no food. We asked for our money back as we had a appointment to get to. Thanks for the free sticky bun for our inconvenience. that was yummy, just disappointed I couldn't try any of the other food we ordered"}
{"text":"We loved this place. We came here on a whim and were so glad we did! The staff is so friendly, the restaurant has a European cottage vibe and the food was yum too! We didn't have any baked goods but they looked delish."}
{"text":"Love this place!  I've only been here twice, both for lunch and both times were excellent.  Great place to get a sandwich - hot or cold. Fresh products make this a nice lunch spot. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced, great country/farm-style food. Good selection. The maripan-filled croissants aren't the reason to eat here (try Cafe Soleil). Instead come here for the perfect frittata and generous plates fit only for the hunger called brunch.

Maybe its built into the low prices, but I could do without the kitchy decor, the noise and unremarkable bialys. Also, what happens if I don't want to eat my weight in eggs? Then I only eat coffee.

Bring some granola home."}
{"text":"This place is a little out of the way for me, I live near Atwood, but it's definitely worth the trip.  Their sandwiches and baked goods are par excellence, they have no rivals in Madison.  And they happen to have a good selection of vegetarian friendly fare.  Plus the service is great to boot.  Even if you have no reason to go out to the North side you should still find the time to give Manna a try.
Notable choices: the Earthly Delights and Ozy Tuna sandwhiches.  Both the couscous and new potato sides are excellent and you can't go wrong with any of their baked goods."}
{"text":"I come here regularly; the group of people I have Saturday brunch with really like it. I think it is OK. The food is very good. The prices are a little bit higher than average for all the breakfast places around Madison that I have gone to. Manna will take plastic with a minimum purchase, if you just want coffee you have to have cash, there order system is a little complicated. Especially if you are waiting to meet other people.  You can't take a seat unless you've ordered and then the rest of your party has to put their order on the original table number, which gets met with resistance every time. You need to bus your own tables, get your own coffee and water. Lazy Jane's does the same thing but their price points are a little lower. That's why I think the prices are to high for the work the customer has to put in. There is a tip jar at the register and everything gets split, so it's not possible to tip one person for good service without tipping the rest who may not be giving good service. I can't comment on the dinner selections I've only had breakfast at Manna. This place is mainly for Adults, but sometimes there are kids there and it is not a good thing, the chairs and tables are placed very close together. There is outdoor seating available, not very attractive, it faces the parking lot, but it's there."}
{"text":"Had breakfast this morning with my husband. They were pretty busy, although from what I've heard this is not atypical for this establishment. Upon entering I noticed that they take orders a bit differently than most places. Instead of being seated and then ordering, you instead order at the counter and your food/drinks are then brought to you by a staff member. After looking through the menu, and feeling slightly pressured to choose quickly by the growing line behind me (I can be a bit indecisive at times), I decided to go with their ham and herb quiche with a side of fruit and added on the chicken sausage as well. My husband went with his favorite meal there, the sticky bun french toast. We also ordered two coffees. Our food came out in a very timely manner, considering the large breakfast crowd. Upon arrival, both meals looked very appetizing - you could tell everything was fresh! After getting into the meal a bit, I wasn't quite sure that I cared for the texture of my quiche. The upper layer was much creamier than what I've had in the past. I noticed on the menu there was a small aside stating they make their eggs creamier intentionally as a style preference. The creaminess in no way affected the great flavor, however it just wasn't for me. Additionally, I wasn't thrilled with my chicken sausage. It was served in a large patty and was loaded with spices. For many, this may be a great thing but I felt that it was a lot and the flavor overall wasn't my favorite. My husband's french toast was a rich, sugary pile of syrupy goodness and he enjoyed every bite of it. Additionally, he ordered a side of eggs and there was a fresh fruit accompaniment included. If I'm ever in the Madison area again, I will certainly give another menu item a try. It's clear that they have massive following with many loyal customers. They've got to be doing something right!!!"}
{"text":"We went for an early breakfast on a Saturday and really enjoyed the design and ambience. I'm a fan of Lettuce Entertain You Restaurants, so had high expectations. 
The comfortable design and focus on clean food engaged me from the start. They offer both themed coffees and brunch cocktails, which were interesting and fun. I ordered a mimosa, which came I three color options, but the best part was that the juice was fresh. 
My husband ordered the eggs Benedict which were nicely done. I ordered an amazing eggs and chicken tinga and was quite happy with my perfectly done eggs."}
{"text":"Friendly service!  The quiche and granola pancakes are both delicious!  The lattes are huge.  I've also had the Peter Wrappit, which was very good.  We generally go to Manna for brunch.  I'd say it's one of our favorites in Madison!

The dinner service is really nice.  It has a really different vibe than the breakfast atmosphere.  They accept Bicycle Benefits!"}
{"text":"For many years I hated going to Mana as they were super slow. Staff and service were awful. Im happy to say that has all changed. Staff is more responsive and the service is much better. They also offer dinner and it's AMAZING! Highly recommend this to everyone."}
{"text":"Everyone loves Manna Cafe! Their quick service turns tables quickly. This place is always so full but I've never had to wait for a table. This place is clean too, some patrons bus their own tables but staff clean this place up quickly (I love that). I love being able to order at the counter, let others go ahead if I'm being pokey, then order & go on my way. Decor is comfortable. Water is offered complimentary.

Bakery items are great. What's unique to Manna and a must-try are their quiches, my favorites involve artichokes or asparagus. Slices are large enough for a meal. Oh, also the soups - more recently have had good luck with chili and dahl. Vegerarian options galore, but my favorite sandwich or wrap is the tandoori chicken burrito. Really a unique menu for a cafe.

Manna's website is updated frequently; daily specials are always posted - soups, quiche, daily special. More establishments should do the same. This area needs a Manna Cafe and seems to appreciate it."}
{"text":"The lunch here is incredible...but only on week days. The weekend menu is sub par. I've been here on every day of the week at various times, and without fail, they take absolutely forever to serve your food, whether for take out or dine in, and whether you called ahead or not. Don't come here if you're in any kind of hurry. The farmhouse chicken is amazing though!"}
{"text":"We visited Manna mid-morning on Sunday. Busy but no wait. We split a scramble -- very good. Service polite. Atmosphere fine -- nothing fancy. 

A special note: It's apparent the owners care about cleanliness. Plates, silverware, glasses were spotless -- and this makes a huge difference. Keep up the good work, Manna!"}
{"text":"I used to live a block away from Manna, and it was always the place to be for breakfast for my girlfriend and I.  My favorite is their sticky bun french toast, and my girlfriend prefers the oatmeal pancakes.  I usually order a latte from here and it's pretty good.  My girlfriend doesn't like the coffee but she's 
certainly no expert on coffee quality, and I haven't tried it myself.  We haven't been back since moving to Sun Prairie, but it will always be one of our favorites and I'm sure we'll be back in the near future."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Manna cafe, and let me tell you I am a fan! Very cute atmosphere and there are lots of bakery goodies. I tried the apple pie slab and it was delicious. I also had the hot chocolate and it was good it would have been a little better if it had been a little more hot but it had the perfect amount of whipped cream. You order at the counter and the lovely staff bring the food to your table. This place is a little bit out of the way but i will for sure be back and try more of the bakery goods."}
{"text":"This rating is primarily based on the food. The food was amazing! I had the oatmeal pancakes my first time there and have gone back several times since then to try other things. The atmosphere is terrible. Very loud, find your own seat and hope no one's sitting there, get your own coffee, if you've never been there before you have no idea how to order, but the staff are willing to guide you through IF you ask. They don't really go out of their way to welcome people at the door."}
{"text":"The location is great as there is almost nothing on the Northside of Madison. However, they make really incredible food and bread. The have their own flair for the standards (the reuben) as well as unique sandwiches and soups of their own. I've never tried the quiche, but am told it is superb. The have a nice arrangement of coffees (including a Fair Trade option). If you are going for lunch, it is best to get there before noon as the place really fills up fast."}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday morning, odd ordering system you wait in line and order at the counter then get a table, while you're waiting or eating if need anything  get in line again and wait! A little strange but the food was very good. Get the eggs Benedict."}
{"text":"It may be off the beaten path, but it's worth the shlep.  Our office ordered lunch carryout from here and, for once, everyone was pleased as punch with our restaurant choice.  The menu offers loads of options, from sandwiches ($6.95-$9.50) to salads, from cheesy to healthy.  Combos are an option too, for those who are indecisive. It's so fun to get to look at a menu and have multiple, creative vegetarian dishes to choose from.  All sandwiches come with a side dish too, and you're not stuck with just fries or potato chips - I'm talkin' couscous salad or mixed greens to be had!  

I had the Veggie Might Sandwich (artichokes, spinach, roasted red peppers, onions, feta) and upgraded my side option to a cup of the lentil soup (+$1.50, toootally worth it - delish!)  Each day there are different soups (always a veg option too) and various quiches of the day.  All are listed on the website, which is quite helpful and probably cuts down on redundant phone calls. 

The cafe itself is bright and cheerful, spacious with plenty of tables.  I inquired about their weekend breakfast/brunch rush and was informed by the staff that it's usually pretty bustling but there's never much of a wait at all for a table.  Score!!  With lunch being as good as it was, I would definitely add this spot to my brunch \"to-do\" list."}
{"text":"Great addition to the neighborhood.  Wonderful (homemade) soup & quiche specials every day, tasty salads, and hearty sandwiches.  The space is well done and it's also a breeze to get take-out.  I get lunch from Manna at least once/week.  My only complaint?  Sometimes their portions are a bit stingy but maybe I'm just being greedy!"}
{"text":"Try the oatmeal pancakes!  They will change your life.  I'm not even a big fan of pancakes but I find myself craving these.  I have to say that everything I've had here was wonderful."}
{"text":"Great food but lousy service - I just spent $35 on bakery there this morning didn't receive a thank you from anyone!  Remarkably, the person who helped me and filled my order is one of the owners!  This lack of service happened to me at Manna before and I decided to give them the benefit of a doubt and try it again.  Clearly, they don't appreciate my business so I'll take it elsewhere"}
{"text":"Not great! I've tried it, I've gone back. I've given 2nd, 3rd and 4th chances. It pains me that I cannot give 5 stars to this place because I want to.
The first time I went was for breakfast, I ordered some pancakes that were so heavy and dense with nuts and granola they could not be recognized as pancakes, they were not inedible but they were not what I was looking for-- it was a case for trying ta bit too hard and messing up a perfectly fine thing- 3 stars.
Second time I went I had a turkey sandwich... very low quality rubbery meat. It was the first time I was actually relieved the ratio of meat to bread was quite low because it was a case where more meat would not have solved this sandwich's problems. The soup was good. So I think that made solid 3 star experience. 
Last week's visit I came for breakfast-
Disclaimer, I am not an egg person... so for breakfast if you don't have great alternatives, like solid waffles-- fluffy flavorful French toast or golden pancakes with a little pizzazz it's not going to work for me. I spent $11.00 on an iced tea, a fruit salad and a scone. This is not acceptable to me. If I orders an latte instead in an iced tea-- the cost would have been understandable but I did not feel like the value was there for what I received. 
Other notes-
The coffee is okay, the cake is delicious especially the lemon. Mostly I just regret coming here for a meal each time ... so I think unless I'm getting baked goods to go I'm probably going to pass."}
{"text":"The eggs are amazing and pancakes are very good, and service was outstanding and friendly.  This place is great."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Manna for years. For a long time, it's been the only breakfast place on the north side that really pays attention to quality and is local. They sometimes struggle with their popularity. They have implemented a new-ish system whereby you get assigned a table, order at the counter, and then get the food brought out to you.

Anyway, I had the oatmeal pancakes with bacon. The pancakes are just like a bowl of steel cut oatmeal, but with tasty brown. The bacon is also tasty, though I would rather have two pieces of thick cut bacon than three slices of thinner bacon. 

I'm grateful every time I come here for the cafe au lait. First off, it's actually on the menu so the barista doesn't get confused. Second, the coffee is mellow enough that I never need to add sugar."}
{"text":"Manna is a great spot for an early morning breakfast on the way to the Dane county airport.  We had the bayou omelet special which my husband loved.  Flavorful but not too spicy with andouille sausage and delicious shrimp.  I had the Chippewa frittata made with wild rice, green onions, mushrooms, bacon and cheese. Our son had the spinach scramble with well cooked potatoes.  We had the fruit cup instead of potato and it was lovely.  All dishes came with a fresh onion bialy which was wonderful.  It was a lot of food for about 9.50 an entree.  We took two bialys with us.  Restaurant had that real Madison feel and bakery case was full of nice stuff we were too full to be tempted by.  I would stop there for a meal for the plane!"}
{"text":"2 out of 4 orders were wrong, and they came half an hour after we ordered. The surly older woman who I went to complain about the incorrect sandwich was unapologetic, and I had to READ OFF OF THE MENU the sandwich that I was expecting because what I got was the \"standard.\" The food was fine, definitely not worth the long wait and 50% success rate."}
{"text":"Manna took extra special care to help me provide food to a friend. I SO appreciated the outstanding service and excellent food! Thank you, Barb and Mike!"}
{"text":"This is a cool little place! The decor and vibe are relaxing. The food is delicious. If I lived in Madison, I would be visit here regularly. This is great place to come for a bite to eat, read a book, or visit with friends."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff. Fresh food and delicious coffee/lattes. So happy this is in my neighborhood. Continuously an easy choice."}
{"text":"Delicious food! The style is order at the counter, and they'll seat you when a table is ready. We've never waited long, and you can enjoy coffee as you wait.

The food has never been less than amazing! It comes out quickly, and they usually have a special quiche for the day."}
{"text":"I had the greatest quiche of my life here.  I will never forget it.  I can't comprehend how it was so fluffy. Wow, yum..I want to go back now."}
{"text":"It took me far too long to try this place. There's a wide selection of food, and what I had was delicious. Also, perhaps the best potato salad I've had at a restaurant. Very relaxed atmosphere and good service. I will be back."}
{"text":"Love Manna Cafe!  They are friendly, the atmosphere is awesome and the coffee rocks.  Love that it is local.  The food is really good.  The salad dressing is very good.  I like that it is kid friendly, too.  Mr. Square Head is a very cute peanut butter sandwich--and they serve puppy chow as a side to kids meals!  

I'd give it 5 stars, but it is a wee bit pricey, like many other places in Madison.  $7 for a tuna sandwich and side (small) salad."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp and since I needed to be near the Dane County airport I decided to give it a try.  On entry into the place it looked like a counter bakery - any chance Manna Cafe might want to post a sign on where you can find a menu?  A gentleman behind the counter finally figured out what we where hunting for and pointed to where we could find the menus.  Interesting selection of food items, but I thought the prices were a bit high.  Ordered the oatmeal pancakes and my husband had 2 eggs over easy, toast, and a side of sausage and a side of potatoes.

First, the oatmeal pancakes had interesting texture but virtually no flavor - was I suppose to douse them in syrup?  Manna didn't cooked my husband's eggs over easy so they had to be re-cooked, and they forgot the side of potatoes both times the eggs came out of the kitchen (which they provided when we mentioned it - both times the potatoes were a bit overcooked).  And, can you have sausage with no flavor?  Manna managed to make that a first experience.  Good meaty texture but, really, no flavor!

Obviously a place to go to be 'seen', but as far as a destination place for food at those prices - not likely."}
{"text":"We often go to Manna for lunch. They have been serving consistently good sandwiches. Love love their carrot cake. I actually start with that first every time I am there. Recently we tried their breakfast. Fell in love with their oatmeal pancake. A must go place if u haven't been here already. Their assortment of baked goods are as good if not better than their other menu items."}
{"text":"Food was amazing, so I'm giving 5 stars just for the gluten free food alone. 

They got our order wrong like 3 times, so that was frustrating. But they did fix, that was great."}
{"text":"Best quiche in town, most versatile menu. I absolutely love Manna! It's always crowded, try to grab a seat at the bar if you can."}
{"text":"I had the scrambler with asparagus and mushroom.  I was offered to add meat..I did and added chicken sausage.  I didnt realise it was going to be a side instead of in it.  I also asked for a side of fruit.  My husband chose the breakfast nachos.  My husband thought his dish was ok.  I only tasted the salsa,which was good.   I did not like the chicken sausage because there was too much thyme (I have a sensitive palette) and thankful it wasn't in my eggs.  The scrambler was tasty and the potatoes were OK.  I liked the choice of fruit in my side.  All in all I'd return but try something else.  Oh..and I tried the iced chocolate milk and espresso (magic mocha?)...not a fan.  It just was a bit gritty and I was looking for a little more chocolate taste."}
{"text":"I went there for brunch this AM (Sunday brunch).  Fabulously organized - I was worried when I saw the line - but a guy at the door told us how long it would be and helped us get a table.  A very relaxing way to spend Sunday brunch on Valentine's weekend."}
{"text":"The staff here is very nice.  The food is decent.  The coffee is delicious.  The food is a little pricier than I usually like.  The quiche is worth it though.  Great atmosphere too."}
{"text":"Love the granola pancakes. I've been making them at home ever since I had it there. Portions were large, cost was a bit more but definitely worth it. Busy in the morning and thinned out later around 10am."}
{"text":"My go-to place for caffeine, pastries and occasionally the stinky-bun french toast.  Can be hard to find a seat at peak bunch times and sometimes the kitchen seems slow but but it is still the best breakfast place I have been to on the east side.

I particularly like the tarts the sell though they tend to be under-cooked."}
{"text":"This place is nice, expensive but nice.

They appear to have \"in store\" made pastries.  the atmosphere is that a coffee house or Cafe so it works for what they're trying to do. I'm willing to bet you'll never be able to find a trash can though."}
{"text":"Love this gem of a cafe!!
My first time to try Manna Cafe was just last week. I purchased a bag of the house made granola and it didn't disappoint! Yummy!!
For lunch I had the egg salad on their gluten feee house made bread! As a GF eater I was so excited to have a sandwich on homemade Gluten free bread and it was so soft and tasty. There aren't many local restaurants that make home made gluten free and because it was so soft and tasty I questioned it being gluten free. What a treat! 
The staff are very friendly and service oriented. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Super cute and cozy diner that's the perfect spot for a Madison brunch! 

You start by ordering at the counter, and then you wait for the head of house to tell you a table has opened up. During prime brunch hours, you wait about 10-20 minutes for a table and 30-45 minutes for your food to be served. It is quite a while, but they're up front with their times so you're not left guessing. Unlimited coffee refills of 3-4 options of coffee plus 5+ options of milk and cream left me a happy camper and not too, TOO hangry. 

I went with a simple continental breakfast of yogurt, fruit and my choice of a baked good, and my goodness did the scone knock my socks off. Literally orange, raisin, oat perfection. I would come back just for all of their impressive baked goods alone! Manna is worth a visit for sure!"}
{"text":"You will never view quiche the same after you eat a slice here. Every day you will find two flavors, each with in-season (to the extent possible) ingredients, including pairings you may not have thought possible. Do not stress yourself with counting calories, because every savored bite is worth that stick of butter you are consuming. As good as the quiche is, I'd eat a pan of that pie crust on its own.

I drop in a day or two a week for their fresh Johnson Brothers coffee. The sunrise muffin is exceptionally good and has some veggies in it, so I pass that off as healthy.

The only thing that is frustrating is the slowness of the service. I think they could be more efficient using the two registers and having another person fetching coffee and goodies while the cashier keeps a steady flow ringing up customers. Speaking of customers, it amazes me there are menus clearly posted and visible, plus paper copies you can hold in your hand and read, yet nearly no one is prepared to order when it's their turn. It drives me crazy when I need an express lane during those early morning visits on my way to the office."}
{"text":"Manna is a lovely little spot to stop for breakfast or lunch. Their pancakes and frittatas are unique and flavorful. Everything is affordable and comforting."}
{"text":"The food is always great at Manna. I've been here a lot, and it's always been delicious. It's a good place to go and eat and catch up with friends.

I usually go for brunch, which can get pretty busy. Go-to menu items for me are the El Cubano sandwich, BFW wrap and the breakfast burrito. I've had some scones, pie and other bakery items and they are always fantastic. They also offer some gluten-free items, which is great.

The space is large and warm. The staff is very nice and outgoing. The prices are reasonable.  

BUT, I do not like how things work since they remodeled. The remodel itself made the space a lot bigger. Fantastic. But before, you could order your food and pay at the counter and then find a seat and your wait for your food. Easy. But now, a host will seat you and give you a table number. Then you have to get up and go order your food at the counter with your number, and then go back and sit down and wait for you food. And then you have to get up again and go pay at the counter. It's a stupid setup, and not nearly as convenient as it was before. Too much running back and forth for the customer.

But besides this confusing new setup, the food remains good. Also, I hear they are going to start serving dinner sometime in March!"}
{"text":"This is a solid choice for brunch. It's a casual place where you order at the counter and then wait for a table. I had the Wisconsin sunrise scramble with ham and scallions. It was all quite good"}
{"text":"Run, don't walk, to this wonderful little bakery.  My husband and I found it through Yelp during a two day stay in Madison.  We ordered our breakfast (a scramble off eggs and ham with potatoes and delicious toast) and took our coffees outside.  The meal was brought to us -- and was heavenly!  I love that it's local food, and love that the people who work there are friendly and obviously enjoy their jobs.  Thank you, Manna staff.  This is what hospitality is all about!"}
{"text":"Great for breakfast, good lunch and dinner was also yummy.  
It can be pretty busy on the weekend breakfast, but everything is very good.  Nice fresh salads for lunch.  They recently started dinner and we stopped by and were delighted by the food at a reasonable price.  They hit it big!  Very, very good."}
{"text":"I was amazed to find this gem on the east side. Perfect atmosphere for large or small groups, great food, and a unique selection of decadent bakery items!"}
{"text":"I was in the neighborhood to drop off shoes at the shoe repair place a few doors down and decided to grab a hot beverage.  I could see through the window that this place was hopping (on a Thursday at lunchtime) and once in the door took two steps and got in line. There was a bakery case showing some beautiful stuff, which I eyeballed while the ladies in front of me tried to figure out what they wanted. 

I ordered my latte and went over to the beverage pick-up area to wait. I was surprised to see another cash register that is, I think, just for ordering drinks. I wasn't in a giant hurry, but that would have shaved some time off, so duly noted for next time. It took a few minutes longer than I expected for my drink, but as the place was full of people, there seemed to be just one employee running the espresso machine, and she was busy the whole time, it wasn't so bad. 

Once I got my caramel latte (I only get them a few times a year, they're an indulgence) I felt like getting back in line for another one. Dang, it was terrific. Easily the best I've ever had. Not bitter at all, not too sweet, it was the baby bear of lattes."}
{"text":"Get the brisket grilled cheese, and they use JBC coffee, who may be one of the best coffee roasters in Madison.  Otherise, they're known for their quiche, and it's pretty great.  Very cozy, cute place.  Lots of weird creepy cat figurines though haha.  I absolutely love this place."}
{"text":"Manna Cafe is an excellent spot to grab a quick lunch and yummy lunch!!! I cannot say just how long I have been driving right by this place and never even noticed it was there but I am glad my hunny talked me into stopping by. The chicken sandwhich was great and perfectly sized - If you want soemthing that trumps the local fast food joint then Manna should be on your list. They have a rather large seating area inside and a small pation area outside. The place is neat and clean and everyone was very friendly."}
{"text":"I've only been to the Manna Cafe once - a client of mine took me there after a press check. We both had a breakfast sandwich - mine was \"The Cravenous Carnivore\". Consisted of scrambled egg, sausage, pepper jack and a little basil pesto. Who knew pesto would be good on an egg sandwich! Very yummy. Atmosphere was great and the baked goods looked fantastic. I definitely want to return soon!"}
{"text":"Good, but I don't love it as much as others

Nice north side Madison location, with an odd ordering system, with great looking if variable tasting food. 

Everything looks just marvelous, but the food is variable in deliciousness.  In fact some was down right mediocre.  Some was great. Coffee fair. 

Scone, dry and meh. Muffin, superb. Frittata Special, bland. Walk in the Woods - eggs creamy, soft and delicious. Onion baked good served on the side - wow.  

Prices are fine, service nice, but I like the food at a lot of other places more

A 3.5 rating, but we will round up for yelp."}
{"text":"I have lived near Manna for many years and I have gone there so often, it is almost embarrassing.  This Cafe is virtually perfect.  I rarely visit for anything but brunch on the weekends and the brunch is stellar.  The portions are generous, the atmosphere inviting and it is very popular.  Sadly the popularity lends to some long waits but that is not the fault of the business.  When you are popular, you attract a crowd.  

Before I talk about the food, let me say a few things about the patrons and the atmosphere.  I do have a complaint about the winter season.  The restaurant tends to be too warm for me.  Others may differ but I usually wear shorts and a t-shirt when dining there, even in the dead of winter.  If seated in the back room with the fireplace, it is even more uncomfortable.  But that, again, is a personal issue.  In the summer months, the patio is a great option on a not too humid day.  A few of the tables lack umbrellas at times so those can be frustrating.  I love that people can visit with their dogs and eat outdoors.  That is a fantastic way to treat the neighbors and neighborhood.  Now... on to the food.   The food has always been great.  A few years ago, they changed their menu, keeping many of the most popular items and adding new ones.  I was there a few weeks after this change for breakfast and noticed a menu option called \"Navajo Veggie Bennie\".  Here is the description from the website.  

\"Navajo Veggie Benny(V)
Grilled cornbread topped with refried beans, bell pepper onion saute, and chile hollandaise. Garnished with avocado and tortilla chips.\"

It is one of my favorites.  Understand, I have never had a bad meal there. But this one was fantastic and spiced perfectly.  (Midwesterners are often adverse to spice but being a southern born bear, I like a bit of heat.)  This did not disappoint.  I often get a single Granola Crunch Cake on the side, and this is their fabulous oatmeal pancake coated with their own granola and some banana.  It is too good to pass up.  There are so many great options on the menu, I often take an exorbitant amount of time deciding what to try OTHER than my favorite Benny.  They have fresh pastry, muffins and a huge selection of juice, soda, Izzy, and favorite alcohol laced breakfast drinks.

Once again, I have NEVER been disappointed in the meals I have had over the decade that I have visited this establishment.  The staff is top notch and the gentlemen working there, if I may say so, are all very attractive.  The ladies are as well but my attention goes to the boys.  ;-)

I will say, my biggest complaint is not with the cafe or staff or food, but is with some of the patrons.  It is not uncommon to visit on a very busy Saturday or Sunday and find people long finished with their meal, just relaxing and enjoying taking up valuable table space.  I was always taught that in a busy restaurant, when tables are filled, you eat and soon thereafter you vacate your table to allow others to sit and enjoy their meal.  There was one occasion several years ago that my companion and I stood in the dining room with our prepared food in our hands for almost twenty minutes.  There were no less than 6 tables that had finished their meals but continued to just sit and chit-chat.  Eventually I overheard one person say, \"We should probably go, because those guys over there have been standing and holding their food for a long time.\"

Yes, we had been.  Our food was cold but the staff recognized this an offered to re-fire our orders.  We declined their generous offer but to this day, I am a bit incredulous that so many people completely ignored the fact that at that time, table space was a premium and even after eating, they continued to linger.

Alas, that issue was not the staffs fault.  They did try to \"gently\" urge people to leave yet it was not heeded.  

Suffice it to say, the place is worth the wait during busy times and I cherish having this business in my neighborhood.  I sincerely hope they never go away.

Is it slightly more expensive than other places?  Yes, but only marginally and the entire experience from food to service is worth every single penny."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch with my wife. I had the Monte Cristo with potato salad and she had the Rachel with a bag of chips. The food was excellent. The portion sizes were perfect. The only negative was the price. I'd say we probably paid about $4 too much for what we got."}
{"text":"I rarely get a chance to dine in, but the new to-go sandwich called the \"Trendy Tendy (Tenderloin)\" was drool worthy.  

And of course their baked muffins and croissants are still fantastic"}
{"text":"They deserve 10 stars!!! We stumbled upon this unbelievable gem of a location driving home from he Dells...There are not enough words in the world to describe what happens at Manna!!! The pasties, the oatmeal pancakes, the eggs...yes Eggs like I have never tasted...I live in Chicago and wish I could drive to Manna at least once a week. Great service mind blowing food...a must!!!!"}
{"text":"J and I both came here Sunday. J said it was the best breakfast he had in a really long time. The set up is extremely efficient. Order your food at the counter. Go get your coffee and condiments at a station. When your food is almost ready they will call your number and seat you at a table. The place was apcked but run very efficient and staff were friendly even though you could tell they were super super super busy. I ordered the Okeefe ( i think that was the name of it). It was two poached eggs on slices of corbread with black beans baked in them and drizzled with generous portion of somehwat spicy hollandaise. I really should've ordered some kind of toast or bread to dip into the sauce because the cornbread alone was to doe for. I did order a side of dressed greens and they were over the top crispy and fresh with a slightly tangy vinaragrette dressing. I will definitely have to go back for salad alone because in my world, THAT WAS SOME DELICIOUS SALAD. Exactly how it should be dressed. Very simple but full on flavor and freshness. J order MY Big Fat Greek Wisconsin Scrambler with pan fried potatoes. He didn't share but I noticed that his dish had local sausage and feta wich I'll have to try opn our next visit. J also noted that the potatoes were very crispy yet mealy and fluffy in the center. He's a potato guy and gave Manna's side of breakfast potatoes 5 stars. He also said that I'm crazy if I don't Yelp Manna and give it a 5 star rating because this is the cutest gem of a discovery we have found in Madison."}
{"text":"Weird organization. You order and then hope you get seated before your food comes out and therefore you also feel like you need to finish your food quickly, but the food is great!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite cafe and bakery in Madison. It's a cute and quaint place to just hang drinking coffee. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  Had the nacho breakfast today..absolutely yummy! The salsa was so fresh I asked for seconds!"}
{"text":"This place is magnificent! Perfect atmosphere for any amount of people, amazing food, amazing and friendly and attentive staff. I've eaten here twice, once for breakfast and once for lunch, and although things are a wee bit on the expensive side, I always leave wishing I had gotten seconds to go.

Also worth noting, since they just recently rolled out dinner as an option, they have amazing and creative dishes, incredible drinks, and it's super easy to get a nice caffeine fix at dinner time in addition to breakfast and lunch.

Suggestion? Get yr butt out here ASAP. It's good stuff and I promise you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food is always yummy and perfect for folks with varying dietary needs. They can accommodate both vegetarians and gluten free folk as well as the standard diet. Prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is inviting."}
{"text":"I love breakfast.  I mean, LOVE breakfast.  Leslie Knope and her waffle obsession has got nothing on my love for Eggs Benedict.

When I want a delicious meal, great coffee and a homey atmosphere, I come here each and every time.  Apparently, so does everyone else--there's sometimes a wait on the weekends.   

If you don't like Eggs Benedict, get the Lemon Love--blueberry pancakes with lemon curd. Oh.my.god.  Amazing."}
{"text":"We ditched the usual eat all you can buffet brunch for Easter and came here instead.  No reservations, but no problem.  Order at the counter and seat yourself.  The food is the reason to come.  It is all homemade, creative, organic, and delicious.  My eggs were creamy with asparagus and were served with a delicious cinnamon muffin and a bowl of fruit with whip cream.  I ate some of my wife's potato fries that were very nicely seasoned.  She had the veggie breakfast sandwich which was fresh and pleasing.  The bakery counter was hard to pass up but we were satisfied and full after the brunch.  I'll come back for the scones and pastry another time."}
{"text":"This brunch spot had great options ranging from sweet to savory. Definitely plan ahead if you're going to be there during prime brunch hours because they are very busy! Mannas had a great low key vibe and felt like I was in my grandmothers gourmet kitchen. Great overall experience and would definitely return."}
{"text":"The breakfast is the best thing ever. The wild rice omelet is one of the most original and delicious breakfast dishes I have ever had.  The eggs benedict are also tasty and well-cooked.  When I lived in Madison, this place kept me coming back. 

I wasn't as excited by the dinner selections though....mostly soup and sandwich options, which I think of as lunch. But their food is always fresh and good, no matter when I go there."}
{"text":"There is a wait during weekend brunch time, but that's normal. Food is good and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Went on Saturday morning, for the first time. Had the breakfast basic and a regular americano. Breakfast came right away, but americano didn't, and had to wait more than 10 minutes while the breakfast was getting cold. I had to ask the guy making coffee, and apparently the order didn't go through. I had the regular size, which is the middle size, between small and large, I think. But he put only one shot of espresso in a regular americano. Do they put half-shot for the small? This was the first coffee place I've been to that puts one shot for a regular size. Finished my breakfast, and studied while drinking coffee at the smallest table (for two). I was asked to leave or move to the counter (obviously not suitable for studying) because there were a lot of people waiting. That was a little over 2 hours after I started my breakfast. Another first \"cafe\" that I've been to that downright told me to leave. Would not recommend to others."}
{"text":"This place rocks! I have come here for lunch many times and I am never disappointed. First of all cute environment with several outdoor seating options as well. You order at the counter which sometimes can feel a little rushed given all the delicious options to decide between!

Today I got the chicken shawarma platter and my dining partner for the tuna sandwich. I love that the menu has so many options from healthy to fried to cheesy to gluten free to veggie. Something for everyone!

My only complaint is that sometimes it can take a while to get your food. However this forces me to sit back relax and enjoy my lunch time!"}
{"text":"Marzipan. Filled. Croissants. 

The marzipan-filled croissants alone earn a strong review for the Manna Cafe and Bakery, but truly every aspect of my dining experience there were very positive. Along with the croissant I had a pot of tea and a Southwestern-style Eggs Benedict, in which the eggs were served on top of cornbread with black beans and fried potatoes, covered in a spicy creamy sauce. It was a daily special, and I felt very special for the chance to eat it. Yuumm! The atmosphere was very relaxing, and the friendliness of the staff make it an extremely inviting place overall. I highly recommend the Manna Cafe & Bakery to anyone who wants an inexpensive meal that is fully of flavor and high-quality ingredients.

Manna Cafe & Bakery: Marzipan-filled croissants are only the beginning of the wonderful things to be had here!"}
{"text":"We stopped in during the morning rush.  We have only been there one other time. So I felt uncomfortable not knowing immediately what we wanted.  
The sticky bun was a hit with us.  The swiss cheese & ham croissant was flaky and not overly cheesy.  Certainly worth the time and money.  I suggest stopping in when it's not so busy to check out the menu. 
Listening to the group of older men sitting and chatting outside made me smile."}
{"text":"THE place to go on Madison's North Side.  Roomy, beautiful decor, family-operated, friendly staff.  The pastries are good, the bread and rolls are excellent, and the brunch and lunch menus are amazing!  There are lots of good vegetarian options, all clearly marked.  The Earthly Delights sandwich is my favorite--wow.  The soups and salads are also very, very good.

My only complaint is Manna's coffee, which is sometimes thin and over-extracted.  People who don't have a taste for good espresso may not mind (my Mom likes it fine), but I have to order a mocha or flavor syrup to cover up the bitter taste, and the texture of the mocha simply does not compare to what you'll get at the cafes on the square.  Still, it's probably the best coffee on the North Side."}
{"text":"The BLT Guacamole sandwich bread was over toasted. I ordered the breakfast potato nachos to go for someone who can't eat eggs. When I got home there was the egg right on top of the nachos. They didn't give us the sour cream and homemade salsa that it is supposed to come with the dish. I used to really like it here even though it is so expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"Delicious brunch!! Had the homemade granola with almond milk and fresh fruit (bananas and strawberries), 2 eggs over-easy and a side of bacon. I also tasted the eggs benedict, breakfast burrito and a few pastries, which were all yummy!! The fresh OJ was needed and the servers were all great! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Super disappointed about my first experience to Manna Cafe. I had high hopes after reading about the restaurant and being new to the East Madison area. I ordered an egg scramble - the sides and baked goods are tasty, but my eggs were raw. And I don't mean just \"jumpy.\" I mean that there was egg yolk dripping down my plate. They were simply inedible. Being rushed for time, I didn't want a new plate, but I did want the waitress to know of the incident so that no one else was served runny eggs. She seemed to not care, at all. She said \"oh, sorry about that\" and walked away. Didn't offer to give us any sort of refund or a pastry to go or anything. I was not asking for much, but this could have turned into something much worse had I continued to eat these eggs. I do not anticipate being back based on how the situation was handled. No, I don't think that this is a common occurrence, but the sheer lack of customer service and willingness to make things right was severely lacking."}
{"text":"Cafe drinks are hot and tasty, brunch dishes are fresh and delicious, service is prompt and friendly, and the atmosphere is cozy and warm.  This is a great place to grab brunch or coffee and have an intimate conversation. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We've eaten at Manna twice and the food has been great. Depending on the time of day you go, there may be a little wait to order and be seated. You are required to take a number, order and then wait for a table to become available. I had the O'keefe last time and it was delicious if you like a little spice to your eggs benny."}
{"text":"Tasty homemade breads. It's a bit overpriced here. But do try the quiche, gluten-free bread, anything breakfast, and a surprisingly good tuna melt. I love the space too--you can settle in the back with a computer and drink coffee while you work. Time passes quickly and productively. Nice staff too."}
{"text":"I love Manna Café, especially for the quiche of the day. Get there before noon to be assured a slice. Even then, sometimes they're sold out. Some food is under seasoned. Cookies, coffee are awesome."}
{"text":"Madison has a ton of really good breakfast/brunch options, especially near downtown and this amazing cafe and bakery is no exception to that constant. Tucked away in the corner of a shopping center near Madison's north side, Manna has a really diverse selection of menu options, bakery items and delicious coffee options. I really enjoy the \"Jack Benny\" eggs benedict that features heaping portions of house braised beef brisket and bacon on top of the perfect amount of hollandaise. Add some breakfast potatoes, a little hot sauce and ketchup, baby you got a stew goin'!

Scones/Danish are always spot on and the rest of the bakery I've tried has always been on point. 8/8, will return again. And again."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! Though I think it's just hidden from me since I'm not in this area often and the place was packed all morning. Our party of 3.5 was able to sit immediately at 10AM Sunday morning. By 10:30, there was a line going out the door. 

For first timers, the ordering/seating/situating process is a little confusing. You see the host, get a table number, grab whatever table you'd like, look over the menu, order at the counter, take your drinks, and sit back down and wait for your food. 

The food is delicious!!! The fritatta was loaded with mushrooms and so savory and oniony. The biali (my first) was light and chewy and wonderful. Fresh fruit all around. 

Coffee and water are self serve at the opposite end of the ordering counter which means that you're constantly back and forth through the busy host stand / ordering line, hoping you don't spill your hot coffee on someone. I suppose if you look at it from the perspective that this was designed purposely to create some serendipitous moment where you bump into your future soulmate, this is very well designed. If you're just trying to get to your table without spillage, maybe not so much."}
{"text":"Had the eggs benedict and vanilla latte. Everything was great. We went on a Saturday for brunch and it was very busy. Expect to wait awhile for an open table. It just shows how great everything is. It's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here today and it was really great ^_^. We ordered oatmeal and the Monte Christo and then the lap of luxury .. it was a lot of food but it was so good then he ordered extra Italian sausage but they ran of it since it was already 1pm so he had bacon instead.. this place serves a lot food for what you pay it's so worth it! Would be coming back again!"}
{"text":"This place is always packed, with most eating food or working on laptops. It's a great place to meet and greet on the North Side, and we need more like it."}
{"text":"Waking up just in time for brunch, my boyfriend and I decided to give Manna a shot. I'd seen it suggested on Yelp a few times, so I had pretty high expectations. Those expectations were met and far exceeded. We shared Raspberry Kissed Mimosas and played a game of Scrabble from their shelf of board games as we mulled over the menu. 
 He opted for the aptly-named Morning After breakfast burrito, and I couldn't not get the Breakfast Maven, Manna's answer to bagels and lox. 
 My self-proclaimed breakfast burrito aficionado gushed that his burrito was the \"best in his life\", a statement I can't help but trust him on. My plate was a perfectly-tweaked take on a classic breakfast, consisting of the ordinary brined salmon, onion, and capers, but made extraordinary by the use of garlicky Yiddish bialy bread. 
 I couldn't help but snag a marzipan croissant on our way out, which proved a pleasant surprise when I later remembered it on my counter. 
 In all, Manna has truly changed my breakfast game. This will absolutely be my go-to when guests from out of town seek restaurant advice, and will absolutely see more of us."}
{"text":"When the boyfriend and I decided to take a road trip to Madison to accompany (read: chauffeur) his sister to check out a possible grad school, my first thought was, \"where are we going to eat?\" Manna looked adorable, so we included it on our route.

Manna is very cute. Homey, but not too country, with a decent sized seating area and a cozier room in the back with some armchairs and also tables to eat at.  The menu is really big for a bakery-cafe type place, almost too big, as I found myself ordering without really perusing all the options.  It was cold and rainy out, so I went with a cup of the tortilla soup and the Badger Special, or something like that- basically grilled cheese and tomato. I had a few issues, namely that the 'tortilla soup' wasn't really tortilla soup at all, or at least not like any tortilla soup I've ever had.  It was very chunky, and, well, there were no tortillas in it. It tasted good, but was too chunky to dip my grilled cheese into. And isn't that the whole point? The sandwich was good, but I always forget that while grilled cheese with tomato sounds like a good idea, in reality it doesn't work.  The tomatoes get all mushy and bland, and prevent the cheese from forming that perfect melty seal. Again, I really have only myself to blame. When will I learn?

The boyfriend and boyfriend's sister both seemed to enjoy their sandwiches, as well as the other soup option- creamy potato with cheddar. I tasted a bit, it was awesome. I was sad. 

If, for some reason, i ever find myself in Madison again, I'll probably try to make a stop at Manna to try some other delicious-sounding sandwich.  I'm guessing this will only happen if the sister decides on UW. Go Badgers?"}
{"text":"Love the products. I give the food five stars. But the overall experience of trying to get the products prompts me to give three stars on Yelp. If you have time to kill and need a coffee or a super high-quality treat or sandwich this place is for you. I live nearby and would always try to swing in to grab something on my way to work. Gave up after awhile. I'm not looking for a Starbucks or McDonalds experience - but cripes, the pleasant but spacey staff are slow! If there is even one person in line ahead of you bring a book or a magazine to entertain yourself. Having said that - if you have nowhere to go and time on your hands - go to Manna - great people and fabulous products."}
{"text":"Manna is a real gem of a neighborhood cafe on the north side of Madison.  They've been open almost as long as we've lived here, so I've visited on many occasions and always had a good experience.

Originally a coffee/breakfast/brunch/lunch spot, Manna has also been serving dinner for a while now.  I've enjoyed all three meals, but most of my visits are in the mornings for coffee and a pastry.  I'm a big fan of the savory ham & cheese croissant from the deli case for a quick breakfast to go.  Manna serves Johnson Brothers coffee and always has their Black Earth Blend (my personal fave), a decaf, and another variety of caffeinated brew available.  

On a recent late lunch, I really enjoyed the Cruban - a Cuban sandwich/Reuben mashup that was delicious, with a cup of sweet potato jalapeno bisque that had a nice pepper flavor without being overly spicy.  The place was bustling into the afternoon on that visit, and
weekday mornings, lunches, and weekend brunch can be busy at Manna.  I haven't made as may dinner trips but it's been steady but less crowded the evenings I've been there.

Manna has a warm, friendly vibe with lots of families and groups dining in, and folks grabbing a coffee and pastry on their way to work.  It's a real neighborhood hub and a wonderful place to have on Madison's north side."}
{"text":"We got the Ham and cheese quiche and the spinach swirl.  The quiche was very good, but the swirl was bland.  The food is well-prepared with fresh ingredients.  The coffee is excellent.  I like the atmosphere, especially given that it's in a strip mall."}
{"text":"Super tasty Sunday brunch! DELICIOUS vanilla bean latte, and a wonderful omelet with roasted tomatoes, caramelized onions, and chèvre. Perfectly cooked as well! The side of greens was dressed in a very tasty creamy vinaigrette. The staff were also helpful and friendly. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Very good breakfast. Had a delicious breakfast burrito with a side of cheesy hash browns and a cup of delicious black coffee. For the quality of the breakfast food, it came out in only about 15 minutes, which did not seem like a long wait at all. Very friendly staff, only complaint is that it is a little bit pricey for the portion sizes. Would recommend and go there again."}
{"text":"This little gem of a restaurant has simply amazing food! The quiche is the best I've ever had. Everything is homemade - breads, soups, desserts, etc. All of the desserts are incredibly good. The decor is casual and somewhat lacking in style but the food certainly makes it worth the visit."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed going here! It was busy but worth it. The bakery items are unique, as were the entree options."}
{"text":"Oatmeal pancakes, egg scrambles, breakfast burritos and lots of baked goods. This is a great place for breakfast.

The oatmeal pancakes are very hearty and I've tried to replicate the recipe at home, but there's no way I've gotten close.

I wish they would use reusable ramekins for sauces. I'm considering becoming a one-woman army to fight little, plastic cups at restaurants with perfectly functioning dishwashing systems and helpful staff.

WiFi is notoriously slow, especially for a place people love to get work done on laptops.

But if you need a great place to have breakfast with that friend you haven't seen in a while and you need to catch up, come here. You order, pay, people bring you excellent food and leave you alone. It's great. Not so much soul food as a place that's good for your soul."}
{"text":"I heard about this breakfast restaurant tucked in a little mall off the main roads of Madison. I made the visit this morning. They have a nice bakery counter with nice options from sticky buns, apple turnovers and cherry pastries. I ordered from the menu grabbed a table and waited only 6-7 minutes. Time enough to read an interesting article. My order arrives a breakfast scramble with out the wrap. It was eggs, sausage, bacon, peppers, potatoes, cheese and spices. It had a nice kick. I ordered the fruit was the meal which was strawberries blueberries grapes and orange slices. It was delicious. I'm glad I was able to enjoy a nice meal, and I'll be back again. I recommend."}
{"text":"I have been to Manna more times than I can count. Whether its stopping in to grab a Hazelnut latte and quiche, or sitting down for breakfast, I have enjoyed every single visit. My favorite items on the menu are the Eggs Benedict, Oatmeal Pancakes, and various Quiches. For lunch, all of their sandwiches are unique and fresh and always satisfying! Their baked goods are great as well-especially the scones and chocolate croissants. 

Although many restaurants in Madison have impressed me with food, the combination of Manna's great food, warm staff, and friendly atmosphere, make it one of a kind. I recommend it for everyone-breakfast, lunch, and dinner...however, breakfast is my personal favorite! Manna is normally packed on Saturday and Sunday morning, so big groups can be difficult to squeeze in.

One last tip: their Challah bread makes great french toast for at home :)"}
{"text":"Friendly atmosphere, pretty nice breakfast/lunch menu, OK service, best part is that they had board games and cards so you can play while you waited!

Bottom line: not as great as blue plate, lazy jane's, or sophia's if you want to have a hearty breakfast, but maybe I should try the coffee the next time I'm here."}
{"text":"I had the Tenderloin Triumph today, and it was less than triumphant. I thought it would be a fairly hearty steak sandwich, and I was looking forward to the horseradish sauce and \"rustic\" French bread. Well, it was basically roast beef on white bread. The sauce had no kick and the bread had a totally bland and squishy texture. Ate a slice of German chocolate cake; the filling was yummy, but the cake was dry and not very flavorful."}
{"text":"This is a sit down breakfast place but you order up at the front. I don't think I would order a mimosa again for the price - you get a very small champagne flute. I ordered the green thumb frittata with a side of cheesy hash. It was good and pretty filling. I tried some of my friend's oatcakes and they were quite delicious. I would definitely return if back in the Madison area again."}
{"text":"Delicious!  A great breakfast spot with lots of seating options.  Outdoor seating is on the edge of the parking lot so that's not great.  Their food is excellent though and they have a large center table if you have a big group."}
{"text":"If I were to design my ideal neighborhood coffee shop I couldn't do better than Manna.  Pleasant, relaxing environment.  Great food and drink, especially the coffee.  Although I live in the neighborhood, I would travel quite a ways to go to a place like this."}
{"text":"This eclectic community diner has a casual, friendly ambiance. We came for breakfast, on a Sunday morning around 930, and while it was crowded, we didn't have to wait for a table. 
There's a self serve coffee bar and you bring your own beverages to the table. after ordering/paying at the counter, there's just a short bit before the food comes. Kind of amazing considering how busy it was. Breakfast items range from creative, creamy egg scramblers-I've tried a different one each time but the spinach is a favorite- to knock-your-socks-off-good oatmeal pancakes. Another helping to go please? 
The sunrise muffins and bran muffins are outstanding too and rumor has it you can call and special order them. Pastries and cakes look good but I've yet to try them--always too full from the meal!
Like another person said, it's a little unclear how to tip here, since you pay at the counter before the food comes. We just put our tip in the tip jar when we ordered and paid. On the plus side, since you've already paid, they don't bring you a check at the end of your meal and we didn't feel rushed to leave before finishing like you do at some busy breakfast spots. Will definitely be back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"I love eating here when he come to Madison because the gluten free baked goods are the best. We really enjoy the giant peanut butter cookies and the cranberry walnut muffins. We usually get them to go. Manna Cafe is really popular so there is a wait. You order at the counter. Sometimes there's a wait just to get a table, but usually after you get a table you also have to wait awhile for food. I've enjoyed the eggs with gluten free toast. Highly recommend for gluten free people."}
{"text":"Best Eggs Benedict in town. Best. I love this place and you should, too. Fresh baked goods, excellent, piping hot and lemony zesty eggs benedict. I love it."}
{"text":"This place is a wonderful find. Sort of out of place amongst the run down buildings that pepper that neighborhood. Great breakfasts, if a bit pricey compared to some of the a.m. joints. Decent coffee, and a nice tea selection. A cozy atmosphere, low key enough to sit a bit and read."}
{"text":"Without further delay, I'm here to officially profess my deep love and appreciation for Manna Cafe & Bakery. Let me count the ways...

#1 - Their bakery items are insanely delicious and made with big love. In fact, I would even venture to say that they have the best chocolate chip cookies in the city.

#2 - All of their quiches kick SERIOUS ass and the Away in Provence omelet is my all-time favorite of their egg dishes. The combination of warm chevre with sweet caramelized onions is luscious & comforting and then there are the bright flavors that come with the addition of the garlic-roasted tomatoes & basil. It's genius level! But wait, there's more!!! With the omelet, you also get a bialy & greens.  You can't go wrong. The bialy is soft inside with this great, chewy crust and the greens are fresh & dressed perfectly.

#3 - Not too long ago, they changed how they approach seating/ordering and it's created a much smoother flow along with quicker service. Winning!

#4 - Speaking of service, everyone at Manna is excellent! I've never had anything but stellar customer service experiences each time I've been there.

Oh, how I do go on......  I'll stop there for now, but just know, Manna is an excellent choice in a city with so many great choices. They are quality in every way and well worth the wait (if there ever is one). Go, my friends, go early & often!"}
{"text":"I've been back to Manna a few times now... it's just so delicious. I ordered their signature oatmeal pancakes last time. I am normally a savory breakfast gal, but let me tell you - these pancakes. So worth it. Friendly service, warm environment. We've somehow had the willpower to avoid the sweets but they look heavenly. Their drinks are great too. My sister got the maple butter latte - yummy! We will be back... soon!"}
{"text":"I loved the portabella, garlic aoli, arugula, and egg breakfast sandwich that I got at Manna's while my boyfriend thoroughly enjoyed the gluten-free buckwheat pancakes. We liked that they cater to our dietary restrictions and offer good variations on the more typical american cuisine. The atmosphere is like a cute with people using their laptops or phones to answer emails as they enjoy coffee or food."}
{"text":"I stopped by here this past Sunday morning for brunch.  We arrived at the restaurant shortly before 10 and the place was already packed.  Almost every table inside was taken and the line to order your food was almost out the door.  This is the type of place where you order at the counter, they give you a number (in this case a spoon with a number on it) and then they bring your food out to you whenever it is ready.  Whenever I saw a table getting up, I quickly told my fiance my order and swooped in to grab it.  A short time later she was back at our table with our coffee drinks.  Whatever she had ordered coffee-wise was quite reasonable in size especially compared to the large Americano that I had ordered.  Hers was a normal coffee cup while mine seemed like it came in a large drinking glass that I would be more comfortable drinking beer out of than coffee and the vessel was almost as big as my head.  Regardless of that, the Americano was made well and tasted good and I did eventually finish it long after we had finished our meals.  For my entree I went with the sweet hot mama omelet which was an omelet with bacon, sweet sweet potato, caramelized onion, pepper jack, and a side of spicy homemade salsa.  It also came with a bialy and pan fried potatoes which ended up being the best part of the meal.  The pan fried potatoes had a good crunch to them while the bialy had a good firm texture on the outside but was soft on the inside.  My omelet wasn't too bad either as the eggs were cooked nicely and the bacon crispy but it definitely felt like it was missing something.  That was probably where the spicy homemade salsa would have fit well into the meal but I honestly could not taste any spice on it and so I used it sparingly.  After I had finished my brunch I noticed others bringing back an array of sauces (BBQ and different types of hot) from a common area which I wish I would have noticed while eating.

The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future especially if I needed a pick me up from some coffee.  It didn't take long for us to both order and receive our food, the food itself was solid and reasonably priced and finally the coffee was absolutely ginormous!"}
{"text":"One of the best new restaurants in Madison!  Excellent food and great staff.  I haven't tried something on the menu I've been disappointed by."}
{"text":"I really like Manna.  I work pretty close, and all my coworkers have always raved about it.  It took me awhile to finally get my butt over there and try it, and when I finally did, I seriously wondered what took me so long.  The first thing I had was a Rueben, and it was pretty much perfect.  The meat was tender and juicy, the bread perfectly toasted.  It was dripping with a delicious Russian dressing and it pretty much melted in my mouth. Since then, I've gone back multiple times, and it quickly became one of me and my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.  While the Rueben isn't exactly an image of health, they have many healthy, fresh menu items that all taste equally as delectable.  I've tried the vegetarian peter wrappit (light, fresh, flavorful), and the not-so-vegetarian southwest quinoa chicken wrap (also fresh, but spicy, savory, and really filling), and both were delicious.  The staff has always been incredibly warm, friendly, and cheery, even amidst the chaos that is their regular weekend brunch madness (proceed with caution on the weekends, it is VERY popular, but absolutely worth the wait).  

My boyfriend and I enjoy playing Scrabble while we wait for our food (they have board games!), and we take desserts to go.  We both agree that the cookies and brownies taste like the best homemade desserts of their variety that we've had, and we always leave feeling satisfied and looking forward to our next visit.

We haven't been for dinner yet (as they just expanded their hours to include dinner) but we glanced at the dinner menu and needless to say, we're excited.  Contented dinner review to follow, as I'm certain we won't be let down."}
{"text":"My wife and I had stopped in for coffee before, but tonight was our first dinner experience at Manna. Everything (soups, entrees, coffees, and desserts) was fantastic. The service was also superb. We'll be back soon! We love that they're a part of the Madison City Tins, too!"}
{"text":"Manna is a decent place to grab a bite to eat on the near Northside of Madison.  I think the baked goods are the highlight of this establishment.  I've had the quiche as a carry out item and thought it was pretty good. 

Today I stopped by for a late lunch. I had the Beef Brisket Sandwich with melted cheese curds. Said cheese curds were nascent but perhaps visually discernible. The brisket seemed more like pulled beef than a traditional sliced brisket. The flavor was really pretty good - but the beef was a bit dry. 

I also had a chocolate hazelnut rugala in honor of the the death of the Nutella founder last weekend. The rugala was very tasty. 

I'm likely to go back... For pastries!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite brunch places when I can make the trek. The service is friendly and the food is great! I generally order the Monte Cristo Sandwich which tastes amaZING and play a game of chess with my friends while we wait. They've got all sorts of board games and I get to ask for hot water tea refills so what else do I need on a weekend afternoon? (Along with the fact that the bathrooms are really nice)."}
{"text":"Really good food at reasonable prices.  We went for Easter Brunch and it was a perfect place to dine- casual, comfortable and really good food.  

This was perfect.  I got the Veggie Breakfast Sammie and it was to die for.   The bread was so good and the egg and veggie just cooked perfectly with amazing flavor.  I think all the bakery is made in house as well as their granola.  

It is an order at the counter type place- no table service.  

The food is top-notch and a must for brunch!"}
{"text":"As a kid, one of my favorite weekend rituals was taking apart and devouring a flaky, buttery, sugary morning bun at Ovens of Brittany. They set the standard for pastry. Ovens had a lot of other wonderful food, too (anyone recall their Chicken Pot Pie?), but they closed their doors too soon, leaving myself and fellow morning bun lovers out in the Wisconsin cold. 

Thankfully, the buns were brought back to life in the kitchen of Manna Cafe. Its proprietor, who also runs the Collins House B&B, knows good food and what people like. When I'm back in Madison, I always know I can visit Manna Cafe for my pastry (and quiche and sandwiches and coziness) fix. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"It takes me at least 20 minutes to drive here, and then I usually have to wait for a table on weekends. It is entirely worth it.

Grab a fresh baked treat and a coffee while you wait for a table and your order. Before you know it, you'll be enjoying a delightful quiche or a salmon Benedict served on scrumptious bialy (or whatever you want; they've got it all). Prices are very modest compared to other upscale Madison brunches. 

Always a delight to eat here. Taking home some fresh baked challah is a special perq of Manna."}
{"text":"I had the French Picnic plate. It was large and very good. I thought it was an unusual and beautiful presentation with the flavorful chicken, brie, olives, and fresh tomatoes over salad greens. The desserts were unique too. I had a chocolate toffee pretzel bar, which another friend had the zucchini cake with cream cheese frosting. Excellent!

I dined here with friends on a quiet Tuesday evening. It's an informal place. I will happily return. If you want quiche you may want to come for lunch, because there was no quiche left by 6 pm."}
{"text":"After years of coming here I can confidently say that it is consistently awesome. The bakery is some of the best in town specializing in various jewish pastries you don't see so much in Madison. The potatoe nachos with some sriracha is my favorite along with the virtuous veggie with bacon added! The coffee is always good too!"}
{"text":"SCONES. Scones. scones. 

Oatmeal date are perfect. Lemon-Iced Earl Grey Tea are divine.

I've also been back several times since my last review and have come to really like the Peter Wrappit sandwich (a spinach wrap sprinkled with frizzled onions, asparagus, greens, red cabbage, carrots, and red pepper relish). 

But seriously, scones."}
{"text":"Service has always been friendly and prompt. Coffee is great. The quiche is well portioned and delicious!"}
{"text":"The best gluten free treats I have ever had! The triple layer lemon cake is so good that I picked some up to take out of state to a friend. I resisted buying my own piece but picked up some cookies instead: so so good and large too. Not cheap or convenient for me, but the quality makes it worth while. I can't wait to come back and try some lunch."}
{"text":"It has a very homey down to earth feel, some simple pasteries and stuff and artsy decor that's very authentic to the culture of the place. I like it."}
{"text":"This is a pretty great place! Food is great and reasonably priced, and the place itself is really cute. The only complaint I have is that it is I went on a weekend the first time hoping to try their Ooey Gooey Grilled Cheese, and it is not well advertised that this is a weekday-only menu item. The cashier was nice and said that they would probably still make it, but the chef said no. That was fine, I got the tuna melt and it was delicious. Funny enough, I ended up going back a different weekday to try the grilled cheese and thought it was just okay. Overall though, I think this place is good and I would definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"Simply AMAZING!  We visited based on Yelp reviews and several I recall we're spot on. The oatmeal pancakes were heavenly. Kind of a cross between an oatmeal cookie and a pancake. The quiche is ridiculous. As a vegetarian, I've eaten a lot of quiche in my day and theirs is hands-down the BEST!  I recommend going with someone who is willing to share dishes as everything on the menu sounds so good. You can't pick just one item. It's a little different that you order at the counter and serve yourself coffee, but the staff is extremely friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Since my last review a few years ago, I've ordered lunch here several times. I came to really love some of the sandwiches, especially the Tuscan Chicken and Classic Reuben. They're both really different--the combo of the Tuscan Chicken's bread and ingredients go so well.  However, the sandwich could be a little dry. The Reuben is a bit messier (although not necessarily greasy) but delicious. Although I know that most of the ingredients are local or made in-house, the sandwiches could be polished in just a few bites. I wanted to eat lunch here more often, but for the amount of food that you get for the price you pay it was hard to justify coming here for lunch more than once every other month or so.

The Trendy Tendy and Classic Tuna Melt were also very delicious. Coffee drinks are still hit-and-miss. Service is fairly polite most of the time but they can be a little slow, even when the place looks empty.

On my last visit, though, I picked up several pastries to take back home several miles (and hours) away.  Their baked goods are all still very good and I miss them... a lot.

I had put Manna on my Underrated Places in Madison list, and I think it still belongs on it. I know that Manna is still fairly popular, but it belongs in the conversation of top Madison cafes along with the likes of Lazy Jane's (which I didn't like), Marigold, Crema, and Sophia's. You probably won't get stuffed here (which is probably unnecessary, come to think of it, considering the weight problem in the US, but that's another conversation....) but you do get delicious, quality food."}
{"text":"A GREAT brunch location, it was one of my favorite coffee shops and erstwhile workplaces when I lived on the northside.

Well-done drinks, gluten-free cookies, bread, and pastries in addition to everything else done in-house, and reliable wi-fi.

Staff is always quite friendly, even when things get crazy-busy.

The only thing that would make this place better are longer hours, as I do a lot of work and socializing after 3pm.. =)"}
{"text":"Composite review from three visits: 
--Food is delicious. I've had the mushroom scramble and a turkey sandwich, and they'll modify orders for simple preferences. 
--Ordering is intimidating, especially if you've never been here and it is busy. You order at a counter when you come in, and if there is a line behind you, it can feel pressured. I think there is a menu near the door for those that would like more time. 
--I always get coffee, and the coffee is self-serve, which can be confusing/intimidating as many of the supplies are all clustered by the ordering/pick-up counter and is a walkway to the back of the cafe. For flow, it isn't the best.
--Although it is almost always busy, I've always been able to find seating.
--The last time I was there, the bin for dirty dishes was overflowing. I bussed my own table out of courtesy--it might even be expected. Again, busy place, but making a few minutes available for staff to change out dirty tubs and wipe tables clean would be an asset.
--Again, food is fabulous. Atmosphere is fabulous with funky mixed decor. I love east side Madison."}
{"text":"Such a cute place!  A little off the beaten path, but don't be fooled: the locals obviously know and love this quaint bakery/ cafe--the place was hoppin!  The quiche is amazing!"}
{"text":"I loved the decor of this place. It looked as if the place was newly renovated recently. Inside, the atmosphere is warm and welcoming with charming wall arts surrounding the dining area. The breakfast menu seem to focus on eggs. There are a lot of options to choose from their 3 eggs scrambles (yes, there are vegetarian option, too). My friend and I went there for Sunday brunch, and the place was pretty packed, and the service was bit slow. The food itself was not that impressive despite of the big tease on the menu. It wasn't bad, but just the average. I prefer the omelets at Sophia's bakery. The baked goods in the glass case looked very tempting. Perhaps on the next try."}
{"text":"Went here one morning for breakfast on a Thursday. Very good food and clean place. My only complaint was that it took over 30 minutes to get our breakfast, but we weren't in a hurry so we didn't mind. They weren't busy at all so I'm not sure what the hold up was. The bakery and dessert items looked amazing although I didn't purchase any."}
{"text":"Came here around noon on a Monday and they were crazy busy. This is always a good sign. I got the tandoori chicken burrito, it was different and delicious. Food took around 15 minutes which I expected since they were full. I will definitely be coming back to try some of there other food options."}
{"text":"I believe that the majority of great reviews for restaurants in Madison, WI are based more on reputation and what people perceive than reality. Manna is one such restaurant. The food is good, but not outstanding. The menu selections are rather dated, much like the rest of Madison. This city has seen time pass them by. One walk into East Town Mall takes you back to 1990. The prices on par with other sandwich restaurants, but the portions are considerably smaller. I have been here a couple of times. The corned beef on the Reuben is tender, the Russian dressing is a little bitter, should be more sweet. Overall, the sandwich is just okay. I have also had the Collins Tenderloin. Basically, a roast beef sandwich, on a small roll. Many restaurants can produce the same sandwich. Manna is okay if you are in the area, but I would never say to drive here for the food. Lunch at a Corner Bakery can be more interesting."}
{"text":"Very good variety.  Food was tasty and came out fairly fast. We were a group of four and each ordered something different  We all enjoyed every bite.  Interesting concept that you order and then sit down.  Not sure if you leave a tip because it's like self service but better.  We did and definitely would return."}
{"text":"Consistently great food. I've eaten here or bought bakery for the last 4 years. Great owners, great staff. This typifies the best of what locally owned food establishments can deliver."}
{"text":"Hey you know what's awesome? 
A burrito to go. 
With bacon, eggs, taters, onion and some salsa on the side this bad boy remind me of my days in the southwest. Haven't found a foldable quite like this and I love... no ADORE that it comes with grilled pineapple on the side!"}
{"text":"Cute and cozy coffee shop. I've stopped here once and have a sandwich and chai tea. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"I have to say average at best. Went there on a rainy Sunday morning and it was packed.....about 30-45 minutes for a table. Upon entering we were given a table assignment and then proceeded to the counter to place our order. Once our table opened up, it was another 10-15 minutes before the food arrived. If you're really in need of immediate nourishment, bakery items and coffee are available.  The bakery items are hit or miss, some really delectable and some really dry and bland. The egg dishes (scrambles and omelettes) are prepared well.  The pancakes are nothing special.......the lemon love cakes with blueberries and lemon curd are ok, the oatmeal pancake is just too heavy and dense for my taste. So, now where Manna's goes off the rails is the coffee......it's horrible! All their varieties.....I tried them all and I'm sorry to report they all were horrible to just tolerable.....what's up with that?  In my book, bad coffee at a breakfast/brunch joint is something that's inexcusable. The actual physical space can also be kinda dirty. We had to paper the seat cushions at our table due to the mystery stains on the chairs. It's great having this type of dining on the northeast side of town, but they'll have to up their game, because as it stands, I'd spend a few more minutes and drive elsewhere for better fare."}
{"text":"Amazing food!  Everything is home-made daily and the sticky buns are the same as Ovens of Brittany's. You are missing out if you haven't been to this place."}
{"text":"I visited Manna on a weekday morning when working from home. The weekend brunch menu seems to have a few more options, but there were still many delicious-sounding dishes to choose from, in addition to the pastries and quiche of the day.

I tried the Garden Goddess sandwich, which had interesting flavors with sweet potato, egg, and curried mayo. I didn't really like the addition of red onion...tasted a little odd compared to the other flavors in the sandwich. I like the option of having greens with house dressing as the side. House dressing was yummy and a nice citrusy contrast to the rich flavors in the sandwich.

Unlimited coffee, free wifi, plenty of comfy spaces to sit."}
{"text":"Got coffee here again... the folks working here are really nice, but my coffee tasted burnt and just not good. It sucks since it's on the way to my work... I went out of my way yesterday and got an awesome 2 shot Red Eye at another place on E Wash (are YOU ready?). It was amazing. Step it up on the coffee front, Manna. Please. I need you."}
{"text":"Manna Cafe is a real gem!
we need a place like this in Austin.
the food is of excellent quality as is the coffee. in my experience, its hard to find a place that does both well.
We were at Manna for breakfast. We had the famous oatmeal pancakes with bacon, and eggs scrambled with veggies, that came with fresh fruit and  multigrain toast. The food was simply delicious and well done.
also, Johnson Bros. Kenyan coffee.  

for the road we got coffee beans, a pumpkin chocolate muffin and a fruit tart. they make all their stuff there and you can tell. no gooey commercialized sugared junk -just flaky not too sweet bakery goodness. 

also, free wi-fi and tables for working.

i like that you order at the counter and your food is delivered to the table. 

yummmm...."}
{"text":"The wait was a bit long for a party of 7 (which is expected) but well worth it! The food was spectacular- would go back in a heartbeat the next time we are in Madison!"}
{"text":"For some reason I don't think I'd ever really been here when I was an undergrad at Madison. And, I feel like younger me cheated me out of some great food and experiences. The breakfast/brunch here is exactly what you need on the weekend, in a cozy environment, with good service.

It's good to get here early - I only had to wait a short amount of time when I got there but while I was eating the line was clearly out the door for tables. A clear testament to its popularity and quality."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! It is a great neighborhood cafe with fantastic food and atmosphere.  I have taken out of town guests there for brunch and on subsequent visits they always ask to go back to Manna.  This is definitely my go-to default location for breakfast, brunch, or a light lunch.  The only thing I don't like is that it's often really crowded (a testament to how many people love the place) and their coffee isn't the greatest- tends to be a little on the strong, acidic side and it usually gives me a stomachache (and I generally like dark, strong coffee, but this is just a little much for me).  I also wish they were open past 3pm- it would be a great place to go in the evenings for tea and baked goods."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! Love the outdoor seating! You can't be in a hurry though. Food you can't get anywhere else like granola pancakes and eggs with asparagus and mushrooms chives and paprika. Mouthwatering and worth the drive and wait! I don't eat sugar but the desserts look incredible as well... Things got can't get anywhere else! It will blow your mind!"}
{"text":"Somehow I just heard about Manna Cafe about two months ago. Since then, I've been dying to give the cafe a try. This past weekend I finally talked my boyfriend into going! Unfortunately, we were both disappointed?. 

I ordered the vegetarian quiche of the day. I'm not a big fan of wet eggs so when I saw a fork full of mushy eggs, I knew I wasn't going to like it. The cheesy hash was delicious but a great side wasn't enough to make up for a bad main. 

In addition to my breakfast, I grabbed a pumpkin-chocolate muffin. This was another disappointment?. When I cut it in half (I was sharing) I could tell it was underbaked. The flavor wasn't great either. 

All in all, it was a below average meal and a little on the expensive side. We won't? be back."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast choices.  Lovely dinner choices.  Nice open atmosphere.  Cool Northeast Side Location.  Nice folks working there.  Nice folks coming there.   I have been here before...I will be there again.

On this occasion, I had the Granola Crunch Cakes.  Two hearty oatcakes made with a tasty Granola.  Topped with Bananas.  Served with fruit cup.  I added some syrup.  These cakes are so filling and satisfying.  Like a Hug for your tummy.

My compatriot got the Okeefe under the Benedict category.  Black bean corn bread, bacon, chili hollandaise sauce, eggs, and topped with Avocado.  He gave me a bite and I was intrigued.  I would like to order that sometime for sure.

So so so good!"}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood cafe and restaurant. Great coffee, AMAZING baked goods, awesome food. Mentionables include: Monte Cristo sandwich, peanut butter chocolate ripple cookie, sticky bun, and frittatas. Omelettes are great but a little runny. Only minus is the location. Not very accessible."}
{"text":"I've heard about this place and thought that I'd try it. I have it two tries. Both a little disappointing. I heard good things about so I'm a little confused. I think it used to be a really good neighborhood place to eat. But now they seem to be maximizing profit at the expense of quality. I head a simple bacon and egg for $9 - the bacon was that cheap commercial paper thing stuff, it was cold and tasteless. The egg was decent but I had to order it medium to get it easy. The atmosphere seems to be nice. I think their patrons are long time neighborhood people who are loyal. Newcomers won't be as forgiving. So sorry I rarely give not so good ratings."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place since it opened around 10 years ago since I know the owners and it's conveniently located a block from my house. In high school I used to stop here for lattes to sip on the way to class or pre cheer practice scones on Saturdays. Now I still stop here often for a cup of piping hot coffee or to grab some breakfast item to go.

Their food is hands down phenomenal. Best quiche in Madison. Their oatmeal pancakes are a slice of heaven. 

The only downside to this place is that it gets super busy on Sundays so your wait time between arriving and getting food can be almost 2 hours. I recommend coming here for an early pastry and coffee run or a weekday lunch. Prices are a little higher than average for a cafe but the quality of ingredients (mostly organic and local/fair trade) in the food you get makes it worth it."}
{"text":"I thought the breakfast food was excellent. I had the carnivore breakfast sandwich with greens. Our table had the Fantasy sticky bun french toast, and husband ordered a special veggie frittata with egg whites. All was SO good!!! The coffee was excellent too."}
{"text":"This is such a classy cafe!  We love visiting here when we are in town with family.  The food tastes great and the menu is varied.  My favorite item is the oatmeal pancakes which are a nice simple variation on a typical pancake.  Cant wait to visit again!!"}
{"text":"Food is a 5+. The coffee is locally roasted and delicious. The entrees are savory and executed perfectly. I especially liked the breakfast nachos with homemade salsa. The people that work there are friendly. The execution of all this is a cluster of inefficiency and stupidity. I don't know if this \"we seat you but you go up and order-you get your drinks but we'll bring the food\" hipster folly is supposed to be kewl but what it is is terribly annoying and obnoxiously inefficient. I stand in line with to go traffic and other diners and it's like a bad que in a Parisian post office. If they dropped this and went with a standard sit down and order model the whole place would be a solid 5."}
{"text":"Manna has pretty tasty food at an affordable price, but with the Madison brunch scene setting the bar so high, it's not wow-ing me.

We ventured over to this hidden gem last Sunday for brunch. We showed up around 10:30, which was good, because by 11, the line was way out the door. Although the ordering process went pretty smoothly, that's where it ended. After placing your order, there's not much room to wait for a table. You get a number when you first walk in, which holds your place in line for a table (the same one they use to bring your food), but it's still a bit hectic.

When we were seated and got our food, it was excellent. I got the Walk In the Woods scramble with greens. It came with a bialy, which was awesome, but I'd like to see more traditional Jewish food on the menu.

Other pros: delicious bakery items, cool coffee drinks

Other cons: location, hours

Try it if you've never been, but not one of my favorites."}
{"text":"An excellent breakfast spot. Great food and coffee. I would come back anytime. It was a bit hectic as it must be very popular. A lot of coffee and baked goods to choose from but the food was delicious."}
{"text":"The eternal dilemma arises -- to eat healthy or give into the need to stuff your face with pancakes. At Manna Cafe & Bakery it's possible to do both. 

Feast on the Collins House Oatmeal Pancakes, their signature dish that's delicious and doesn't completely undo hours at the gym. With a word like \"oatmeal\" in the title, these cakes are obviously the epitome of quality nutrition. The texture of these cakes is insane. They remain moist, yet have a fantastic bite to them, thanks to the oats. There's also a slightly nutty quality to them despite the absence of nuts. 

Very delicious and certainly unique. I crave them, often."}
{"text":"We never seem to be up early enough to get out for breakfast, but this is one of our go-to lunch spots.  First, it's in our hood, second, there's nothing that's less than delicious here.  If you are a caffeine junky, you will be impressed and delighted w the size (and taste) of their large latte.  During the winter, when I think I'm going to freeze to death, I just wanna stick my feet in the cup, it's that big.  There is always a nice mix of people hanging out there.  i like that it's not just hipsters.  Because I am gluttonous, I often wish the portions were a bit bigger, but everything tastes so good, i can't really complain.  Their french countryside picnic salad is my fave item here.  Their chili is also excellent.  I recommend getting it w their fabulous french bread.  They have a really fun selection of soda pops too."}
{"text":"One of the best brunch spots in Madison. Their quiche is the best I've ever tasted and they run out of it pretty quickly, so I'd advise getting there a bit early on holidays to get some. They've really good omelettes - open faced, unlike many others, the cheese isn't excessive and the ingredients work well together. Their chai is another one of my favourites. Their pastries are decent. The wait times can be a bit high on nice days and weekends. The staff are friendly and the decor is modern hippie - my favourite."}
{"text":"When I lived on the north side of Madison I are here almost every week... It's that good! They have a wide selection of hot or cold sandwiches and bakery items. My favorite sandwich is the Sunshine Dreamin' with couscous as the side. 
For breakfast everything is good, I mean it. Whatever you pick will be amazing. They use fresh ingredients and work to balance flavors so that each bite is better than the last. If you go on the weekend the bread served with the meals is a traditional Jewish bread called a Bilay. I wish I knew how to make them because I miss having a Bilay on Sunday morning before heading to one of Madison's lovely beaches. 
If you chose to visit this cute cafe located in a not so cute old building you'll be begging to come back."}
{"text":"Where to begin. My wife and I had spent Winter and this Summer in Wisconsin. We found this gem of a spot down the street from the where we were staying in the local neighborhood. I have ordered just about everything on the menu and have yet to find anything that I have not liked. The chef's really do an amazing job at preparing the food just right, not an easy task when they get as busy as they during lunch, weekends and holidays. Take out has always been a breeze as well.

The waitstaff and baristas are all extremely friendly and attentive as are the owners. They have fresh baked bread and pastries that are to die for. And offer several different soups of the day available for lunch. They have varieties of two different types of deep dish quiche daily that are all quite flavorful and filling on it's own.They also have oatmeal pancakes that are just divine. My personal favorite pastry, the oatmeal cinnamon date scone... I don't know what it is about it... but they are extremely addicting to me, as are the oatmeal pancakes. Weekends brings on a brunch menu that have a few items that can only be experienced then. On special holidays they even have special menu items that really feature the creativeness of the chefs. 

I myself am a tea lover, my wife a coffee lover. They have some of the best blends either of us have had.

They use local ingredients work with local vendors and support local artists.

Thank you Sean, Panda, Susie and the entire staff for always having smiles and kind words. It's a team like yours that make each dining experience enjoyable. 

And to those that have yet to try this gem... what are you waiting for?"}
{"text":"I really have nothing bad to say about this place other than it is too far from my house! The decor is very cozy and clean.  It was consistently crowded when we were there, but it never felt like you were being rushed.  You get seated and then order from the counter.  I prefer this to ordering and then hoping there  is an empty table like they do it at Marigold Kitchen.  I had the The Ojibwe Scramble, a mix of wild rice, mushroom, bacon and scallions, sautéed and then scrambled with a little egg. You have a choice of breakfast potatoes, fruit or greens.  I chose the fruit.  It also comes with a little bun called a bialy. My breakfast was excellent.  If there weren't so many other things I want to try on their menu, I would just order this again and again.  I also ordered tea and it comes in a little pot with a cup.  It lasted me the entire time we were there.  Impressive. On the way home I bought two sticky buns and a loaf of challah bread.  The sticky buns were so good, I wished I had bought more. So, again, nothing bad to say, can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Yummy!! I had breakfast from here the other day and it was fantastic! 

We ordered for pickup, so I can't speak much to the restaurant itself, but the food was incredible! 

I had the Blueberry Lemon Love pancakes. They were big and fluffy and full of big fat blueberries. It was served with fresh fruit, whipped cream, and lemon curd. It was like heaven in a to-go box. Kid you not. 

I also had a side of bacon. Their bacon is thick cut, generously sized and cooked to perfection. I am not a fan of floppy bacon at all. Crispy all the way. This was the perfect crisp! 

My group ordered several other dishes and each of them looked wonderful. The cheesy hashbrowns my friend ordered were so good! I will have to get them next time! 

10/10 recommend!"}
{"text":"Very friendly service, beautiful decorations, and wonderful food. I had the vegetable quiche and potatoes, both were excellent. We'll definitely be back!"}
