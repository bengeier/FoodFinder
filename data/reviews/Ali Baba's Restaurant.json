{"text":"The shawarma at this spot is incredible! Best one I've probably had..ever, and I've had many many different kinds."}
{"text":"Love it, only if they opened up in FL (sigh). Great kabobs for really good price. Healthy fast food with great flavour."}
{"text":"Cheap prices, crappy food.  Don't waste your money on this.  If you want good food, go to the Ali Baba on Lawrence.  No connection to this."}
{"text":"the Toronto Lover system: 5 stars = Must visit! 4 stars = Really good. I take my friends here. 3 stars = Somewhat worth it... if you have nowhere better to go. 2 stars = Below average. Attend only when necessary. 1 star = Do not visit!    You're greeted with a warm smile when you enter this generic \"Middle Eastern\" cuisine establishment that has a twin Ali Baba location nearby at Roncesvalles. All the standards are here: shwarma, falafel, tabouleh; they even offer some yummy fish or roasted chicken once in a while. The only reason to go here is if you're hungry and in a bit of rush, but they'll satisfy both of those issues. Try a chicken shwarma and go all out on the toppings. The vegetables are reasonably fresh. The hummus and tahini are reasonably flavoured. It's inoffensive, generic, pop falafel fare. You're no closer to Israel or Lebanon when you bite into a sandwich, but you'll probably be pleasantly surprised by the service and the taste.  3 stars"}
{"text":"Service is slow... Omg! I was standing there without acknowledgment for at least 15mins!!!   .... I ordered a chicken Shwarma on a Wednesday afternoon. They did have a special for beef Shwarma. Food was good for the price I would definitely come back if I'm not in a rush"}
{"text":"When I told the friendly lady behind the counter that it was my first time, she smiled and simply said \"you'll be back\".  She was right, this place has the best chicken wrap!  I came back for the lamb shank and it was glorious as well.  I've never really had middle eastern food before and I'm now hooked.  Friendly staff, great food at affordable prices, what a neat place!"}
{"text":"It's more of a fast food joint that serves middle eastern shawarma and platters of lamb mixed with veggies and middle eastern fast food.  As regards to setup, imagine going to a Burger King... Burgers are good but don't expect candle lights"}
{"text":"The food here is subpar and rarely fresh. Thr only thing that is good is the hummus which I was lucky to see squeezed out of a bag into the contaoner which contained old crusty hummus.  Hygiene is not a priority here and thr establishment is dirty. Will not be eating here again."}
{"text":"order the = SHAWARMA!  everytime i go to toronto i have to go to ali baba and get myself a shawarma. i have been here at least 5 times. mind you, i've only been to toronto on 2 separate occasions. the food here is always fresh, the sauce is out of this world, and it's dirt cheap! portion sizes are HUGE! i love you, i love you, i love you! you have made me a fan for life. don't ever change!   my life would be complete if i could get ali baba to come open up a store in brooklyn (where i live) i dream about eating your shawarma's all the time. NY i hate you for not having a shawarma anywhere near the deliciousness of ali baba's!"}
{"text":"I love the falafel here!! I always get it. My wife loves their beef shawarma...and we are both big fans of the baklava which is sinfully delicious."}
{"text":"Excellent! Beautifully presented and tasty food. Staff are pleasant prices good. Have had falafel wrap several times and always enjoyed. Will go whenever in area!"}
{"text":"I normally love Ali Baba's... But this location here was a little bit on the sloppy side, and not up to par with what Mr. Alibaba himself would want..."}
{"text":"Its a mom & pop shop, WOW! quite a good flow of people during lunch time. I went here with fellow coworkers during lunch to have some awesome shawarama plate.   The food is Halal. There is plenty of space to sit down and eat. Service was quick and we were eating in no time.  I got their Mixed Shawarama plate.. they plate came with salad, rice, sauce, potatoes and lot of meat! The meat was good well cooked no cheap stuff...   All in All its great place if you are feeling for a Shawarama.   For my muslim folks - they serve halal meat here."}
{"text":"So happy to find a quality Ali Baba's franchise in this area, they have all the classics that you want plus they also have tabbouleh which many locations DO NOT! Check them out."}
{"text":"This is my favourite fast food joint. Great specials, friendly service, always tasty. And yeah, he pickled turnips are worth the shout out; it's sad when there is a shortage and they are not in the condiment rack."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore the Falafel Platter! It's a bit much with six falafel balls, but a really great deal for around $8. The crispy veggies, soft hummous and radioactive-pink coloured pickled turnips are all freaking amazing, to say nothing of the delicious lentil rice, laden with earthy cumin and the ever crunchy tabbouleh. It's a party on my plate with all the differing textures and flavours. Hot sauce has a nice bite and the garlic sauce is killah!  Ali Baba's is a solid franchise with great Middle Eastern Cuisine. The quality is consistent at most locations. Although they advertise their food as being \"healthy\" I beg to differ. It is \"delicious\" but there is nothing \"healthy\" about anything that's spent time in a deep fryer. Knowing this, I feel that I'm still doing my body a favour by choosing this over McDonalds, but I wonder how this dish would stack up gram for gram against a Big Mac combo in a fat contest.  Still yummier than the Big Mac any day!"}
{"text":"Saw that this place had great reviews, so I decided to try it with a friend. Honestly the good here is amazing! Bought the chicken shwarma with lentil rice and loved every bite! Definitely worth your money!"}
{"text":"I drive all around the city for work and this is  hands down the best Ali-babas! In fact this is the best place to buy shwarma"}
{"text":"This location of Ali Baba's just opened on the south side of Bloor, just east of Landsdowne. It's so new that their website hasn't even been updated yet, but I guarantee that it's a great place for some cheap and healthy fast food. (Healthier than your typical fast food joint, that is).     It's no secret that I love Middle Eastern cuisine. Ali Baba's is a place where you can get your typical shwarma, falafel, or chicken in a pita, and there are plenty of vegetarian options as well, all made fresh and at a low price. I got two falafel sandwiches and a carrot juice for about $8! The falafels were crisp and healthy, and the carrot juice was sweet and refreshing!   This Ali Baba's isn't in the best of neighbourhoods, but don't let the seedy figures milling about outside deter you. If you are in the area, or need some quick grub on the go, coming out of Landsdowne station, this restaurant is a mere two minutes away.    They have a large seating area in the back, and also offer take out and did I mention they serve a number of tasty desserts and drinks too. Coolest thing of all: Ali Baba's has a daily special, every day of the week. Tuesdays is two-for-one falafels and you get 2 of these tasty treats for only $2.99. For their size and taste-this is a STEAL!"}
{"text":"They sell Baklava! And they were really yummy. I can't say much more than that.  $2.50 for a large triangle slice."}
{"text":"First of I don't know if this location ever closes, all I know is any time past midnight, usually on a weekend, this place is open.   There is nothing more pleasing to my tummy then their Shawarmas.  The staff is friendly, even at those hours. Seriously at any other fast food joint for the late night hours I never seem to get any sort of decent service, but then I don't complain because not everyone is a night hawk. But  I never seem to have that issue at this place."}
{"text":"Love the food here, so fresh and tasty, no problems here, I just love the shawarmas, so yummy."}
{"text":"I won't add a star, but if I could add 1/2 I certainly would!  Why?    Oh, heavenly chickpea-patty in a pita WITH PICKLED TURNIP, that's why!  Popped in the other day and, lo' and behold, pickled turnip right next to the pink shredded cabbage.  Guy behind the counter seemed very proud that it was there.  Maybe they read my review and said to themselves, \"ya!  why don't we have turnip!  shame on us!\".  See, Yelpers?  It's all me, baby.  You can thank me later.  Or sooner, if you're inclined."}
{"text":"Simple and delicious! Every time I'm in Toronto, I hit this place. Don't forget to try the lentil soup!"}
{"text":"I don't know what the big deal is here, they barely put any meat in the shawarmas.  I'm getting tired of these shawarma places that rely on the franchise name for business cuz that's how we get tricked into thinking it's gonna be worth it.  The fundamental flaw with this place is, yeah, their ingredients taste good, but what does it matter when the whole shawarma is loaded with lettuce to hide the fact that you only got four chunks of meat?  We all know that stingy businesses are probably cutting back on other things like hand soap for employees and diluting soft drinks. I ate with two other people who liked their shawarmas in the beginning, but shortly after they realized how much meat there WASN'T and changed their minds.  We only went cuz Chitos was closed and you blew it!  You get no love Ali Baba. 3 Stars!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad a decided to try this place. My fave by far is the fish pita. Delicious whitefish in a pita sandwich prepared to your liking as you would a falafel or shawarma sandwich. The BBQ chicken is also very tasty at a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"This is my favourite of all the Ali Baba's in the city. I think it's one of their better locations. I only ever get shawarmas and falafels here. I sometimes think about trying something new, but I love shawarmas and falafels. These guys make them really well. All the vegetables that end up in your wrap are really fresh. They deep fry the falafel's right when you order, which is another key to a tasty falafel. The prices are quite cheap, and they have all sorts of daily deals. If you are in the area and want something quick and good, this place is all win."}
{"text":"My wife and I were dogsitting for friends and my wife grabbed dinner on the way. I had a traditional falafel and she had the dinner. Mine was yummy and hers was very good too and huge, she couldn't finish it. My wife said the person that served her was super friendly and made the food fast. One thing that my wife mentioned that I love is the guy that served her didn't look at her her like she had two heads for asking for extra condiments. A+ in my book because it's all about the lubes."}
{"text":"I went to the Ali Baba on Bloor St. West mainly because it had halal chicken. The shawarma and service were pretty good. However, I hate it when cashiers don't return the correct change. Even if it is 10 cents and makes no difference to your life or my life, it matters. At least say something like \"Sorry we don't have enough change right now.\" Don't just not give it back and assume that's acceptable."}
{"text":"If you are in mood of some great Middle Eastern/ Mediterranean food, you've got to try this for sure! We've had Shawarmas and Platters from many places but this one beats them all. The quantity of Meat in the Shawarmas is very good and they make it juicy as well with the added sauces. Even in the platters, the salad, rice and quantity is more in comparison to others.  The place is clean, hygienic and ample seating arrangement. The staff is really cool especially the guy named Monjour. He will always be in a happy mood with a smile on his face.  They also have options of Quarter Chicken Legs and other Mediterranean dishes, on the sweet side there is Baklavas also available.  The best is they have daily deals like 2 Shawarmas for $9.99 and likewise for platters as well. It's pretty good on the pocket as well especially when 2 people are going together.  Great Place, Great People, Great Food and Great Times !!!"}
{"text":"I love Ali Baba's. They are consistently tasty and cheap!"}
{"text":"Love the food.  Great daily specials!!! Fast friendly service.  Reasonable cost.  Will be back soon"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot, Always has fresh salads to choose from. I usually get the chicken Shawarma with a salad. Fast service and clean atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite to eat for lunch. When I first walked in the place looked a little run down and dirty and the staff weren't that friendly. One of the people seemed to try to rush everyone while they decided on what they wanted. Saying this their food was amazing. The meat was tender and the rice, vegetables and potatoes where all cooked well. Definitely coming back here again."}
{"text":"The food is very good and the staff were helpful as well. I have never been to this restaurant before. The staff even gave me a little taste so I can decide what I wanted to order. The chicken shwarma wraps are good. The veggies that they put in the shwarmas are fresh. This is definitely a healthy take out option for those who are watching what they eat. I would definitely come back again"}
{"text":"Really tasty food! I had quite a few dishes and enjoyed them all. Great value and very friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Yes, I have to admit the food here is pretty good and mouth watering!   Whenever I'm in the area I would stop by and order a chicken shawarma plate as usual.  But I cannot help but to comment on the unsanitary washrooms, the women's washroom here looked like a storage space (that's what they were using it for it looked like) and to make it worse the light bulb was burnt out, and no one bothered to change it. Basically going to the washroom in the dark.. besides that it looked like it hadn't been cleaned regularly."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times I fail to see the big deal about this Ali Baba's location.   To start, the food isn't even that good. My Shawarma lacked chicken and when I finally got a piece it was dry.   That wasn't my biggest concern. My concern was how unclean this place was! Tables were dirty, funky smell, dusty area near my table, and some questionable chairs.   I also found the giant colourful Kleenex tissue boxes on the tables weird."}
{"text":"Alan K. from Markham has hit the nail on the head with his review! I love this place and try to pick something up every time I pass by. The service is also great which is rare for places that can get as packed as this place does. Advance warning - once you try their food, you will obsess over it several times a week and want the next fix asap."}
{"text":"Great prices(especially their daily specials), consistent quality food and they seem to always be open."}
{"text":"Cheap quality Mediterranean food. I got a falafel plate with the lentil rice and chickpea salad. It was very good. I wish there were more hummus options but that's about the only complaint that I can think of."}
{"text":"If I lived in Toronto, I would eat lunch here several times per week.  The food is amazing and full of flavor.  The meat is tasty and the veggies are fresh.  I LOVE the hummus and the hot sauce!  The hummus is super smooth the way I like it.  The hot sauce absolutely makes the pita sandwich.   Over the course of my two-night stay in Toronto, we had lunch at two Ali Baba locations.  This Bloor location is interesting because it also has a hookah lounge in back.  Awesome!  Hookah and pita wraps make a great combo!  Next time I am in town, I will def stop back for the hookah meal special!    This is a great lunch spot.  This location has friendly, helpful and accommodating employees.  I liked the hummus so much that the second time I ate here, I decided to skip the meat and opt for extra hummus as my protein.  The staff was happy to help me create exactly what I wanted!  I can't wait to come back to Toronto so I can eat here!!!"}
{"text":"I have tried several shawarma places and Ali Baba's blows them out by far in terms of taste, quantity, and price. They have different daily specials every day but my favourite is definitely the Chicken Shawarma on a plate with rice. The variety in you get in choice of food there is amazing, from 2 different types of rice to choose from (brown & yellow) to the various samosas (veg, chicken, and beef) you can pick and choose your meal. Their humus and garlic sauce is definitely a must try! Their meats are definitely better than a majority of places around not soggy like some places and the portion size they give you cover 1/2 the plate! If you love shawarma, Ali Baba's is definitely a must try."}
