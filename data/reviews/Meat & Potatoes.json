{"text":"We were in Pittsburgh for a special occasion and decided to try Meat and Potatoes. We had a reservation and we were seated right away. I loved the atmosphere. It was pleasantly full but not crowded. No tvs at the bar which made for a lovely ambience. Our reservation was for later in the evening so the restaurant seemed to clear out with the theatre crowd. Our waiter was great, attentive without being overbearing, knew the wine list backwards and forwards and was lovely. We got the fried chicken livers and Cobb salad and then the steak for two with a chocolate dessert. All of it tasted delicious - well seasoned and generous portions on the sides. The only very minor drawback is the two top tables are very close to each other and it feels a bit like you are dining with the couple next to you. I would definitely recommend to friends who visit Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Been here twice now and have tried most of the apps and small plates. So I'll just say the curried mussels are crazy good. We lap up the broth until there is nothing left. Huge portion too. The pork belly tacos are smoked wings are the newest favs fir me. Atmosphere is great too. Always lively and not too many jerks present. Go go go yo!!!"}
{"text":"Service was poor (no silverware when my food arrived, begging for coffee/water refills...) and ambiance was dreadful. Sunday brunch and there's a middle-aged, top buttons undone, \"DJ\" pumping out crap from the corner of the room. Saturday night, sure, I'll expect bad dance music and deal with it but Sunday Brunch!? I asked an employee if the music could be turned down since the bass was so out of control I needed ear plugs but the volume remained the same. Cool bloody mary bar concept but it was messy, you can't make your own rim because the alcohol's already in your glass, and it always seems a little unsanitary...My food was decent but this place is trying too hard and is not good enough for a return."}
{"text":"Went here for a nice dinner before a show. The bartender decided he knew girls better than we knew ourselves and insisted on making us fruity martinis rather than the dry martini we requested. Finally he agreed, and he made the two worst martinis ever. When we didn't drink them and ordered wine, he made fun of us for not liking our drinks.  He was the most annoying bartender I've ever experienced. Then our Red wine came in HOT milk glasses.  It was gross.  And the food? Mediocre is too generous of a description."}
{"text":"A really neat dining experience, esp. when ordering the giant rib eye on the bone.  It was cooked to perfection, tasted awesome and the muscles with tomatoe were the perfect appetizer.  We couldn't quit sopping up the sauce with garlic toast and I enjoyed my dining experience, very much, here!"}
{"text":"Meat & Potatoes is one of the best examples of what the Pittsburgh food scene is up to! I love this restaurant and would definitely recommend it to anyone. It is constantly topping the charts as one of Pittsburgh's best places to eat and is great for lunch, brunch, cocktails or dinner.  I have been here on multiple occasions (including work-related lunches) and have not been disappointed.    The Meat & Potatoes for Two might be my favorite thing on their dinner menu. It is a beautiful, mouthwatering, bone-in 34 oz Ribeye, cooked to your liking (medium-rare for me) served with bone marrow gratin and steak fries... Amazing! I substituted poutine for the steak fries (for an additional charge).   I also think they have one of the best burgers in the city (their lamb burger is my go-to burger in the 'Burgh). Their Monday night late night menu features a nice variety of burgers and snacks to help kick-start your week.  Starting Oct. 6th they will begin POUTINE MONDAYS Nightcap ...  Stay current with seasonal menu pages and check out their website or Facebook page for details.  All in all their servers are super friendly and knowledgeable and the bartenders are very skilled and creative.   Not only is the food delicious but I also love the atmosphere- the dim lighting sets the tone for a perfect date night! I recommend pulling up a seat at the bar and letting the bartender take care of you. Their full menu is served at the bar so this is also a great option if you are coming in last minute without a reservation.    I love the food, love what they are up to and will definitely keep coming back for more (hopefully you will too). Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My favorite bunch spot with yummy offerings and of course the bloody mary bar. I have never had anything that I didn't like here, even taking some picky eaters with me at times. I highly recommend this trendy Pittsburgh spot."}
{"text":"We've been to Meat and Potatoes many times, and we've never been disappointed. This brunch visit was no different, with amazing service from Crystal for a party of 18 - no small feat. The specialty cocktails (this time with vodka, proseco and fruit juice) are always a treat, and they have a small but impressive craft beer list. The food is the real star, though. The short rib hash is among the best dishes I've ever eaten, and the eggs in purgatory and banana French toast got rave reviews from friends. Absolutely a must stop for brunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Went to the restaurant for my birthday  dinner  before a show. It was the best  dinner  my best friend and I have had in a long time.  The service is outstanding."}
{"text":"My wife loves bone marrow, so that drew us here, but the menu is full of awesome tastes and the 33 oz bone in rib eye for two was magnificent!  Rachel, our server, was superb and the wine selection was perfect.  When in Pittsburgh a again, we will be back!!"}
{"text":"The worst service ever. We didn't stay to eat because the hostess was so rude."}
{"text":"Incredible meal and a great value in an interesting setting. I had the marrow and steak, both were amazing. Bring an appetite if you order the pork, it's huge! Decent wine selection, good cocktail list."}
{"text":"my friends and i had been on the road for a few days and, no offense to anyone, but the food culture in the midwest is bizarre. that's why meat and potatoes was a pretty life affirming meal. flavors were done right. our dining area looked like it was probably the manager's office recently and the food was a tad pricey, but after eating at casa nueva in Athens, OH this place was like an oasis in the Sahara Desert."}
{"text":"Great place for just about any dish, best to reserve a table as it gets very busy"}
{"text":"As soon as I entered the restaurant I immediately felt like I was \"fancy pub\" better known as a gastropub. The chairs ( I agree with Rachel C.) were fantastically comfortable and the ambiance of the restaurant was just outstanding.   The food was absolutely delicious, at first we ordered the \"grilled bread\" with goat cheese butter and rhubarb, and although I'm not a fan of rhubarb my friend thought it was delicious and wanted to take it home. I thoroughly enjoyed the goat cheese butter and toast!   My main meal was the roast chicken and potato's with gravy, and yes it was heavenly. I made sure to eat every last bite even if I was full.   The waitstaff was also very kind and friendly and was always making sure we were ok. Even a manager came at the end just to double check.   All in all a great experience!"}
{"text":"The chicken and waffles were DRY. I like the idea of having an entire chicken served on top of a waffle, but the breading was flavorless and one of the pieces was pink on the inside."}
{"text":"In Pittsburgh for one night looking for a place near my hotel and found this place.   I was blown away.  I had a local brew with the chicken livers to start,  I've never had chicken livers like this.  They were light and so delicious with out any of the typical liver aftertaste served with a great sauce with a nice spicy kick.   My entre was the wagyu steak, very nicely done.   So much on their menu to explore I will be back.   Reasonable prices too....large appetizer of livers was only $7."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Their whole menu is spectacular so you won't be disappointed. My favorites were the brussels sprouts and the spaghetti squash as starters and then the duck as my main entree. I can see why this place has over 1200 reviews!"}
{"text":"Restaurant came recommended by hotel staff.  First impression was positive.  Comfy seating for patrons while they wait for their table.  Staff was friendly, and the service was good.  The menu was eclectic.    I took the waiter's recommendation for appetizer, selecting the tartare.  This was a great choice!  Main course was wagyu flat iron.  Entree was prepared well with unique flavors (kolrabi and pickled veggies).  Didn't blow me away though.   Apps/Dinner/drinks for two was ~120 with tip.   Above average, but not sure it warrants a return trip for out-of-towners."}
{"text":"I love their cocktails!! I'm usually very picky on cocktails because not every bartenders know what there are doing.  I like drinks that are strong and taste good (like I'm not paying for soda).  Besides drinks that are excellent, foods are very good too, especially on Monday late night special, juicy Lucy, fantastic!! Only $5, must try!"}
{"text":"I went for Industry Night on a Monday. I guess it's an all poutine menu for that weekly. It was interesting and the service was steller! The food was kind of meh but I mean... It's fries. I wasn't expecting much.  I did go back for bone marrow! It was great."}
{"text":"The food is very good. Will visit again when have enough time. Will try the steak that for 2 people, it needs one and half hour to cook, didn't have enough time last night. The only bad thing is that the table is too close near each other, i wanna sit not between two many people, because thats birthday dinner, but still, they don't have any available."}
{"text":"Food was good, not great.  My wife got the pot roast and that was pretty good.  Service was terrible.  Our server was slow, disappeared for long periods, and never refilled our drinks.  We had saved room for desert because there was a raspberry bread pudding that looked really good, but by the time our server reappeared, they were out of it... So we just paid and left.  The people next to us had similar issues and their server forgot the bread for their marrow and by the time he checked on them, they were done with their meal so told him not to bother.  It also seems like they are trying a little too hard to be cool and trendy.  I am sure being located in the cultural district that is expected, but it feels forced and over done.  Overall, I would say it was pretty average. There are plenty of better places to eat in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"It was sooo wonderful!!!  Salad/ Brussels sprouts / Pot Roast.  Exceptional!!!"}
{"text":"This place is my absolute favorite place to eat in Pittsburgh!! I tell everyone I know who travels to the 'burgh to make reservations in advance. I could easily gush about everything on their menu and their specialty drinks, but one of my favorite things is the bloody mary bar on a Sunday morning. Can't wait for my next trip back :)"}
{"text":"Most of the restaurants in Pittsburgh offer the regular fare, so I went thinking that this could be an exception. Yes, the ambiance is cool, good place to people watch but the price you pay for the experience is too much.  I went in with 5 of my co workers. The waiter Abby, felt like she was doing us a favor serving us. The first thing any good waiter would do is to try and give an overview of the restaurant (kind of food etc) and tell us about the specials. None of that happened. In fact I had to point out and ask her if there were any specials. She simply told us that the specials were on the board behind us and expected us to read through! Such was the snootiness. I put up with it, as I didn't want to cause a scene. She took the orders and it was 35 minutes before the food showed up!! Never bothered to explain why it took so much time and never kept us updated.  Pretty bad experience. Compared to certain classy restaurants like Six Penn and Habitat in Pittsburgh, this place is more pretense and less class. Food was ok, but if  you don't feel welcome, what good is the best food? Go there if you want to drop a wad of cash and ruin your evening"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great. Good misic, lighting, and the barteners were really friendly.  We ordered a few small plates and split them between the four of us.  Drinks are reasonably priced and made really well.  Will definitely go back next time I visit Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"If you are going to a show, this could not be more convenient.   Not to mention that the meals (fish, beaf, chicken, and duck) are awesome.   If you need reservations for a group or special occasion ask for Matthew who is unbelievably effective and accommodating.  Best restaurant in the cultural district. .. hands down."}
{"text":"We were visiting Pittsburgh and came here based on an online article \"25 Best Restaurants in Pittsburgh 2012\" and the concierge at our hotel. I liked that they did not have a run of the mill menu. I ordered the duck (pastrami coated, served with saurkraut pierogies, dandelion greens, on the side.) They had no kids menu but my son ordered the Kobe corn dog with wasabi aioli and flat bread with short ribs, blue cheese, cheddar, arugula, and horseradish.  The food we ordered was tasty. The duck was cooked right and the flavor combinations were enjoyable. I recommend reservations. They were fully booked and we ended up ordering to go and ate at the hotel. The crowd was mostly young adults to middle age. No children (except for mine). The hostess and staff were friendly considering how busy they were when we came. The cost was a little bit on the high side but not outrageous. If I am ever back in Pittsburgh, I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Food is awesome when I'm downtown and I feel like eating I make this a stop all the time there's a lot to do in this area I love the cultural district"}
{"text":"Easily one of the better burgers I've ever eaten. I had the pub burger.  It was topped with pastrami pork belly, \"special sauce, \" and a sunny-side up egg.  Delicious.  My wife had salmon, which she thought was very well prepared.  Fries could use a second frying for more crispness.  Really enjoyed the  Brussels sprouts app.  One of the better Manhattans you'll find."}
{"text":"Best meal I've had in a long time. Bone marrow, tartare, and the ribeye for two. Service was great, food was too. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"One of the top restaurants in the city.  The food and drinks are top notch.  The seating in the bar area is a bit odd.  But, you forget about it when the food comes."}
{"text":"Ate here on Sunday May 12th with a friend. Food was not good. I'm open to variations on a Caesar Salad but this one did not work. Brussels sprouts were overcooked and overdressed. My friend had their  baked chicken and it was bland. We both thought that there was little talent in the kitchen.   Also, we each ordered a glass of wine and these were served in water glasses. That may work in an Italian place with lots of ambiance and where the wine is not expensive, but here it just came off as cheap. Wine at these prices should be served in wine glasses."}
{"text":"The food was excellent!  My girlfriend and I stopped in for brunch prior to a Steelers game and were not disappointed!  I had the Chicken & Waffles, which were absolutely delicious.  I loved the spiciness in the skin of the fried chicken.  The Jalapeno Cheddar waffles balanced very nicely with the Bourbon, Bacon Syrup on top!"}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time last Friday, so 2 days ago.  Pros:  - Food.  Decent fare with some rather interesting items.  I enjoyed my beef tartare and my mussels.  However, Point (and Park) Brugge's mussels are leagues better.  Nothing wrong with these ones though.  - Beer.  They have some nice choices in terms of quality, although it seemed like the number of choices was a bit limited.    Cons: - Service.  The first person I encountered was an incredibly rude hostess.  If you're the girl with the very curly, red hair and you're reading this, get out of the service industry.  It obviously doesn't suit you.  She ignored me, then was rude to me, then told me it'd be a 45 minute wait, then ignored me again.  On the other hand, the other hostess was congenial.  She was able to seat us right away.  Our server was also nice as was our food runner.  Nevertheless, the hostess is the first person you see and helps set the tone for the whole experience and my started off poorly.  - Food.  While my food was fine, my friends' was not.  They each got a sandwich that consisted of a breaded pork cutlet, ham, bacon and topped with a fried egg.  The problem is that the cook put a copious amount of salt on top of the egg.  Let's go over this.  You have a sandwich with ham and bacon and you're dousing it in salt?  No.  - Decor/theme.  I know almost everyone on here enjoys the look/feel of this place, but I feel it is just all over the place.  In some ways they make it feel like a western style saloon.  But then they have the servers in mechanics' uniforms.  Additionally, mason jars are being done to death.    Verdict: A decent enough place, and I wouldn't mind going back, but I'd rather go to other new places or ones I consider better before returning.  Not a bad choice if you need a place to eat before/after going to one of the theaters."}
{"text":"Get the Berry alcohol drink. I cannot remember exact name. Very tasty. Didn't try the food. Great service."}
{"text":"Went on a work trip and was able to grab a seat at the bar. The drinks were amazing and the hanger steak special was on point. I would go back for another meal as soon as possible."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch is exceptional, but be sure to have a reservation. We shared the fried taters. They are unbelievable good and was a generous portion for four people to share. I ordered the Bruschetta, which is a must for mushroom lovers. My husband had the chicken and waffles. The portion is huge and was absolutely delicious.  The only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars is because I'm not a huge fan of their dinner."}
{"text":"Great dinner. I had the Devils on Horseback and Pork Pappardelle. My lovely had the Beet Salad and Spring Chicken. We shared a Strawberry Cheesecake in a jar. Great service. Highly recommend. Book early. We'll go back, no doubt."}
{"text":"I love the bar here. The bartenders are all amazing, incredibly helpful, friendly, and knowledgable. They can make you amazing drinks, and can give some great recommendations too. It can be pricey for the cocktails, but they are worth it. The craft beer selection is cheap if you're into that, too.  The brunch is fab, and the $5 bloody mary bar, including house-infused shots, is one of my favourite things in the universe. Just saying.  This place can get hectic, and there can be quite a wait. The food is pricey, but portions are generally pretty generous. The snacks are great and cheap to compliment a night at the bar.  Lots of out-of-town businessmen and even celebrities regular here. It is generally a 30+ bar crowd.  You're not allowed to sit at a table and just order drinks. It doesn't matter that drinks are mostly $10+ and it doesn't matter that there are lots of open tables. I found that very rude and off-putting when I was refused a table on a Monday night because I didn't want to order food at 11pm."}
{"text":"The meal was delicious but our service was lacking. Our server never once checked on us until time for the bill. We had to ask to find our server to get a cocktail.  For the price service should be better."}
{"text":"Was very much looking forward to dining at M&P after recently seeing it on I believe it was The Food Network. Happened to be in town for the Trans Siberian Orchestra concert (wonderful experience) so thought to give it a try. Reservations were for 5:30, arrived at evening opening and was seated almost immediately when they opened at 5. Provided menu and service items by a nicely interactive wait staff member. We already knew what we wanted so was able to order fairly quickly. We started with fried pickles, and for the main course ordered the $75 steak for two along with rosemary potatoes and roasted cauliflower. The waitress did warn that the size of the meat would take 45 minutes to cook which we understood and still would have plenty of time to make it to the concert. The pickles arrived very rapidly. They were okay, thickly breaded and thick cut pickles but flavor was a bit lacking (primanti brothers and Buffalo Wild Wings both do fried pickles much better). And now the wait...  Meat was horribly under cooked.  Instead of medium as ordered it arrived blue rare at best.  It was so full of myoglobin it was like it was just sliced off the animal.  After getting the waitresses attention, they offered to take it back to finish cooking, this took another 15 or so minutes and now the potatoes were cold, sadly as they were great before that.  The amount of blood and gore with the first presentation pretty much destroyed our appetites.  The waitress had the manager comp the sides.  With this experience, I can't and won't recommend the restaurant, if you do brave it, don't order this meal unless you have vampiric appetites."}
{"text":"Sunday Bloody Mary bar is incredible! Try the bacon vodka as a base, its delicious!"}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times. The first was for a bachelor/ette party. We booked the party room in the back and had excellent service. The menu was limited because we were a private party, but everyone found something they liked. The reason I LOVE this restaurant though is brunch. Sunday brunch is about as good as it gets in my world, and M&P's is the best. The Bloody Mary bar is phenomenal with every possible addition you can think of from standard veggies, to mozz cheese, to horseradish. They also infuse the vodka's themselves. Go to brunch!"}
{"text":"Had meat and potatoes for two a 45oz ribeye with chimichurri and bearnaise (don't get saucey with me...), spinach and and the best rosemary potatoes. Service is a bit disjointed with random people asking you stuff and a drink took a long time but waiter was very good. Ribeye was very good Americans usually screw up thick cuts (you need to go to Tuscany and have a bistecca fiorentina this was close to there). We ordered medium and it was medium. Too much food for being out of town (couldn't have a doggie bag). If I lived in Pittsburgh I'd be a regular!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants downtown! Their dinner menu is great, I always love getting the pappardelle. They used to have Coppola Sofia Blanc de Blanc which was fun but I guess the don't have that anymore.   I have also been here a couple times for brunch, which I would recommend. They have a nice Bloody Mary bar and the short rib hash is fantastic! :)"}
{"text":"Another 5 star... My wife and I went to Meat & Potatoes for after dinner drinks and dessert. Both were delicious. This place has a Prohibition vibe, menu and decor.   We had the fried chicken livers and brussel sprouts. Both were very good. So was our service - we sat at the bar.   Next time I'm in Pittsburgh I'll be visiting."}
{"text":"This was my fourth and least favorite visit, so I'm treating this as an anomoly for M&P.  We started with the Tartare (his choice) and Ahi Taquitos, followed by two specials: Lamb Belly (his) and Mahi over chowder.  We finished with a shared chocolate pot de creme.  From the cocktail menu, the Aviation and the barrel aged Manhatten were ordered.  I usually order the delicious Fried Brussels, but passed on them this time to try some new items...note to self ALWAYS get the Fried Brussels!!   The cocktails were very good, but, also very expensive...they so well made that I would order again! The Tartare was okay, but, the main flavor was salt...loved the soft boiled egg on top. The Ahi Tacquitos were overwhelmed by the dense mini corn tacoshell and the entire appetizer just tasted of corn taco...the corn taco shell tasted like like a store bought, big brand name, taco.   The Lamb Belly entree was ambitious, but, it didn't have a huge amount of flavor; the Mahi, over a thin layer of potato/sausage chowder, was a much better choice, but, still only ~4 stars due to a disconnect between the mahi and the chowder. The chocolate pot de creme is a standard, and was delicious, as usual. The service was fine, no complaints there...but the mirror behind us seemed to be a distraction to our server, as she often watched herself attend to our table.  We will be back, as the menu is so varied and the flavor combinations are always fun...we will just choose more wisely, next time!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots. The only reason I didn't go for the full 5 stars is that even with a reservation - you might still wait. The ambiance is great. Low key vibe and awesome decor. The food is amazing. I almost always go for the mussels, which can't be beat. But we've also shared a lot of the apps and been impressed. Backroom is great for larger groups or work related entertaining as well. Fun place to go but be sure to make a reservation well in advance!"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful! Went here with a friend, shared fried pickles, she got the Plain Jane burger and I got the Three Little Pigs sandwich, and everything was delicious! My sandwich had what I believe was bacon, ham, and some kind of fried pork on it with swiss and an egg over easy on huge grilled bread, and it was incredible! The fried egg really made the sandwich. The fired pickles came with some kind of spicy ranch sauce, and they were great- seasoned well, thick, and a great portion to share for two for only $5. Totally recommend!"}
{"text":"This was my second trip to Meat & Potatoes, and again I am very impressed. For those that place so much on decor, it is appropriate and fun.  It has the gastropub and butcher shop feel. The cocktail list was outstanding!  I loved the drink special \"London Fog\" (had 2 of them), and the Sazerac was delicious also.  Unbelievably awesome beer list.  I'm not a fan of their wine list, but I am very picky.  Also, I do not look at this place as a wine hotspot. The food was excellently prepared.  Everything was properly seasoned, and the burger was exactly med-rare!  Finally, someone who knows how to cook to temp!  The mussels were so good we took the leftover broth home. The only thing I did not like is the way the daily specials were presented.  They are so intricate and expansive that they need to be presented in writing (not on a chalkboard on the wall, because my date couldn't see them).  Instead the server verbalized all of them and after the first 2 minutes of that spiel I gave up on following along.  Please make it more accessible. All in all, I love it, and will be back!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go in town. It can be hard to get a seat at the bar unless you arrive early. Their food is always on point, especially the brunches. The drinks are really why I come though. The bartenders are great and I've never had a bad drink here. Each time I come there is something new on their cocktail menu!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with a friend, and it was a pretty nice experience.  The high rating is due to the food - it was really delicious.  The food had enough ingredients to make sandwiches etc. more upscale, without going over the top.  It's a place I can take my foodie friend to, and also my, for lack of a better word, meat-and-potatoes boyfriend.  The interior was lovely - dark brown and white coloring, a little cramped (but pleasantly so, if that's a thing), and intimate.  The dessert was a pomegranate rosewater cheesecake.  I think that's all that needs to be said.  The reason why I'm not giving it 5 stars is the price and the service.  The price is a bit higher, which I have no problem with if the experience is worth it.  Although the food was delicious, the overall experience just wasn't up to par with what we paid, in my opinion.  The service was also painfully slow for lunch.  Most restaurants open for lunch downtown move at a faster clip than dinner, since most patrons are taking a 1-hour lunch break.  Eating there took almost 2 hours.  Overall, I would still go back there in a heartbeat.  The food and atmosphere was great, if you don't mind paying a little bit more and have the time."}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype is all about. Food was served at room temperature and the flavors were ok. We got devil on horseback, lamb burger, and the duck main course. The service was good though."}
{"text":"Food was great. I had Irish eggs Benedict and bf had brisket flatbread. Absolutely delicious. And decent price. Decor in here is great too. Service was ok. Nothing outstanding.  Atmosphere- tables of 2 behind the bar are very tightly spaced. I felt like I was dining with the couples next to us. Also the bar directly behind us and in line of sight had all the dirty glasses stacked in a corner. At least 15 of then just sitting on the corner. Bar patrons seemed to take note of the unsightly stack too. More and more got added and none were picked up to be cleaned."}
{"text":"My husband took me here and it was an awesome atmosphere with great service! I cant wait to go back and try other dishes. We had the huge steak for two which is served on a cutting board and bone marrow. This was not something Ive experienced before but was cool. My dogs were happy with the foot long bone that steak had :)"}
{"text":"Buckle up and brace for disappointment. This is perhaps the worst hype-to-results ratio I've encountered since the Phantom Menace.  I sat at the bar all three times, and the service was abyssal all three times. Just don't sit there. The drinks were stingy and unremarkable.  There are a lot of pretentious types here. They flock here. The steaks are subpar. And I mean sub-Sizzler. I threw mine out, and I don't throw out steak. But most of all, for the love of all that's holy, don't get the stupid bone marrow. Not unless you like the taste of unflavored gelatin spread on a cracker, in which case, knock yourself out."}
{"text":"In short, very disappointed with both the service and uninspired kitchen.  As a business, M&P lacks true character by trying to fulfill too much and does not hit any of the marks correctly.  If you are a person who shops via brand name itself, this will be the place for you.  If you are a person who says this chartreuse and maroon tie I'm wearing would go great with a black IPA, head elsewhere.  1. Pretentious. Having lived in Austin and Portland, you get a sense of style about a place.  This has the sense of going too over the top in many areas such as the decor and music choices.    The bartenders have \"prohibition era\" hats and some obligatory hipster beards while the music was a bouncy jazz song that played on repeat trying to mask the noise from the crowded place.   As others mentioned, the tables are extremely tiny geared for a lounge and go type of place.  The menu calls canned bear as \"Tin\" .  With all that room on the menu, should it not simply say \"Not on draught\" or \"Bottle\".  Why not \"Aluminum\"?  Personally, go breaking bad and just put the scientific symbol \"AL13\".  But as others mentioned, a PUB means beer on draught; put the bottles on another list - in fact, just put the drinks on another list.  Refer to Peche in Austin, TX for the right way on how to focus on a \"theme\" (in Peche's case, limited french food, Absinthe and Prohibition cocktails)  2. Basic Stewardship underwhelming in a cultural district. Sorry to say, but the staff did not seem to engage with customers more than a basic order taker.    The server did not have knowledge about the beers and could not articulate the flavors of the specials on the menu for us to care; you were left to do the addition.  e.g. Mussles + Curry + White Wine = \"Oh yeah, a light spicy flavor with a salty twinge\"  When asked about the wine and drink list it was a similar reaction.  3. Menu needs love The menu was fairly large and had multiple sections to work with.  There was nothing that called itself out as \"I'm why they call it M&P bitch\" other than the also obligatory (Amarillo Texas Styled) Big steak  Like many early gastropubs, they try focusing on the (fancy?) ingredients more than the mood they're trying to hit with the food.  Give it a condensed description and useful name.  \"Flaming Firey Wings of Damnation\" is a good example.  With a name like Meat and Potatoes, just lay it out there on one side in big letters of MEAT.  Show off the proteins in bold.  4. Food is uninspired.  Had the smoked wings (per other recommendations) and as a self-identified wingman, these were lightly smoked but could have come from Quaker down the block.  The sweetbread tacos were interesting as a different meat but it too lacked a palate definition.  I tried very hard to interrogate the server on other options.  Even to suggest a place with \"Meat\" in the name should try different styles of beef.  Refer to Victory 44 in Minneapolis, MN for the right way.  With a name like Meat and Potatoes, you expect hearty.  With a floral patterned menu and jazzy beat you get not gastropub but \"new American\""}
{"text":"The DJ began spinning a Space Odyssey remix. The doors opened promptly at 10:30, and a small riot of unreserved patrons made a barely restrained rush for the bar.   Meat and Potatoes is not quite as down-home as it sounds. Pâté and bruschetta are on the Sunday brunch menu. Michelle's Bellini was made with real strawberries, and my Bloody Mary bar was a DIY festival with six kinds of meat, probably two dozen pickled things in jars and just as many varieties of hot sauce.   And yet, if there are two kinds of good menus--inventive deliciousness and calculated deliciousness--this definitely was the latter. Maybe it was the decor: I just can't take antlers seriously in a new downtown cultural center. Maybe it was needing to decide between chicken and waffles, shrimp and grits, huevos rancheros AND stuffed French toast.   I ended up with E: None of the Above, but it was hard to know if I was eating brisket hash or a marketing gimmick."}
{"text":"Have been here twice, both times for brunch. Chicken & waffles were always a big among the group, as was the bloody mary bar, both of which are good reasons to go here for brunch. They also have other good Sunday brunch beverages, and a good selection of menu items for whether you want sweet or savory, or both. Monkey knuckles were also pretty good. Service was decent, and the price was fair for a downtown area. This place is definitely on my suggestion list for visitors staying in the downtown area, and would be the kind of place that I'd take my mother to, knowing she'll find something she likes."}
{"text":"This has become my favorite brunch spot. Kudos Pittsburgh on making it difficult for me to decide. Their bloody mary bar is an adult candy store where you can accessorize your mug of belvedere's with pickled turnips, ochra, cornichons, and at least a dozen different hot sauces.  Besides the drinks, the food is all phenomenal. Best eggs benedict. Pastami to die for. Be back soon!"}
{"text":"Have been there for brunch several times and it's as good as it gets!    From the Bloody Mary Bar with your choice of infused vodkas to the Bellini's of the day, brunch starts off right.  Have tried most of the menu between ourselves and our friends that we keep taking there and haven't been disappointed with anything.  My/our only complaint is that the music is a too loud and makes for a difficult conversation...but guess we don't  need to talk when the food is so good!!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! We had the bone marrow appetizer, my husband had the super generous sized three pigs sandwich, while I dined on the hanger steak special. Great flavors, well cooked, good presentation, and great service. Only dock a point because our table was only inches away from the other tables on either side of us which really distracts from the experience. All we heard was the conversation taking place next to us rather than each other. Great place - just need a bit more space!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a restaurant that truly gets it. One could be on thee Left Bank or Soho. It is that good, and without the pretentiousness. There are no mistakes on the menu.  We've tried them all for 30 years. Now we have our restaurant!"}
{"text":"Was excited about trying this place but the concensus of the 4 people in our party, is that this restaurant was a C (on a grading scale of A-F). Food was just ok. Service was just ok. The music at brunch is too loud and when I asked for hot sauce with my brunch order, I was told to get it myself from the Bloody Mary Bar."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere and reasonable prices relative to the quality of the food served.  I would call the food style gourmet comfort good.  I really like this place!"}
{"text":"The service is always fantastic here and the food is to die for. This is one of those places you just keep coming back to so you can try everything! I'm a big fan of the bone marrow in particular as an appetizer. My only regret is that one time I went in for lunch and they had a \"beef brisket poutine\" - it was literally the best poutine I have ever had, and they haven't had it on the menu since! My kingdom for their brisket poutine! But that being said, I'm sure anything they do with brisket is amazing."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. Went to celebrate my birthday. The staff was funny and helpful, even called us a cab for the ride home. Food was fantastic, I recommend the whiskey buffalo wings and the hanger steak. Would DEFINITELY go again (already planing our next night out!)"}
{"text":"Still to this day, my all time favorite restaurant. Even better now when I get to go since I no longer live in Pittsburgh.  First off, make a reservation! Even if you plan on going on a Tuesday night. The place is very popular (rightfully so) and also in the theater district, so on the nights there are shows, packed. If you want to go on a Saturday, I recommend making a reservation at least 3 weeks ahead of time. OR you can do what my friends and I did this past Saturday...They open at 5:00pm and the bar is first come first serve, well, we made sure to be first. We got downtown around 3:30pm and had a drink a bar close by until about 4:45pm, we walked over to M&P and waited at the door until they let us in! We got the corner of the bar, which was perfect for the 4 of us. Cecil was our bartender, which I was happy about, we had him before and he knows his stuff! Not to mention, just a great personalty-makes the experience that much more awesome! :)  My boyfriend and I shared the dry aged strip tartar--amazing. served with a  smoked soft boiled egg, capers, chili, peanuts, and grilled bread. Be sure to open the egg up so the yolk oozes all over the dish, spread a little bit of everything on the bread and there you go..a bite of heaven.  As my meal, I got the Hudson Valley Duck Breast, which I knew I was getting long before we got there. It's soo fantastic! I like mine medium rare (how I would get my steak) and yes, it eats like a filet. This time it was served a little different from the last time I had it, which was a nice surprise! (it wouldn't have been a surprise if I read the menu lol) It was served with sauerkraut pierogies, chimichurri, and warped in pastrami-my mouth is watering as I type this..also thinking of my next trip back!  The drinks they offer are fun and nothing you'll find anywhere else.  A must try! But plan ahead! Enjoy!! :)"}
{"text":"Good place for a pretheater meal. Very crowded even at 5:30.  Make reservations. Well dressed crowd for the most part, with a big bar scene  Had the bone marrow. Three huge bones. Felt like Fred Flintstone. A very good version (very reasonably priced). Was saturated (at least fat-saturated) after that, but still managed to have the hangar steak (very good, and fortunately very lean). In my fat-induced haze couldn't remember what my wife and daughter ordered. Something healthy no doubt. They seemed to enjoy it. Had the Aviation and Sazerac cocktails which were quite nice."}
{"text":"My family and I thought we would try meat and potatoes on a recent trip to Pittsburgh while staying downtown. Take a page out of what not to do at a restaurant here! We stopped by and while waiting for them to see if they had a table, they asked if we were going to the game which we were not. They basically said when asked they would get us right in if we were but put us on a waiting list which was going to be 40 minutes. We went in to wait by the bar and saw five empty tables. Ashley who took our name, came in five minutes later and basically told us there were OTHER PLACES IN TOWN to eat.  What the f?..  After back and forth, she pulled one of the five empty tables out of her a$$ and miracously got us a table. Service still sucked as our waiter rich could care less about getting us drinks let alone dinner. Food was great and my only recommendation is the owner/manager should fire rich and Ashley tomorrow   These two suck holes are costing them a lot of business."}
{"text":"Our server could barely communicate the specials because of the loud music. My brunch was a breakfast americano. The sausage was dry and overcooked. The eggs were not done as I had asked and the bread was soaked in butter. I just ate the potato gratin and left hungry. When I went to use their restroom there was no soap in the bathroom and saw one of their servers leave without washing their hands. I would not come back here. I would leave zero stars if possible."}
{"text":"We happened to walk pass this place and decided to stop in for brunch.  We sat at the bar.  Let me just say, the food was great but Mai, the bartender, was excellent.  She gave us great suggestions l, was very engaging, and took great care of us.    I started writing this review before we received the check.  My husband mentioned that we're in Pittsburgh enjoying our wedding anniversary.  Mai then surprised us with a celebratory drink.  She is simply awesome!"}
{"text":"Fantastic brunch. We really enjoyed the Bloody Mary bar! I had the huevos rancheros and my wife had the eggs Benedict - both were delicious. This was our third visit. Consistently good service every time. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The food we had here was innovative and really tasty. Unfortunately our waiter seemed lost, we asked about their specials and he told us there weren't any, and then 15 minutes after ordering he told us actually they do have specials and finally read us the list. However, once the food came out we had no complaints! The atmosphere was warm and the chairs were really soft. We didn't get drinks but the menu looked interesting definately worth coming back to try."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided on a little preseason \"tailgating\" and came here for drinks and apps. As I walked in the door, I received some snobby looks from the host stand, but ignored it. The look was like \"what are you doing here\". Whatever. I found my friend at the bar and we caught up for a bit. It literally took them 8 minutes (I kept time) for them to acknowledge me and tell me the specials. After scanning the restaurant, I noticed some specials on their mirror from the other side of the room (no one told me about them). I ordered a peach and herbs drink (bourbon). The drink itself was good, but no real taste of peach, just bourbon. It was good, but I know I could've made a better one. My friend had a Southie she said was good.  We ordered the mussels with bread, fries and truffle aioli. Not kidding, about 1/2 my mussels were empty :( The bread was soggy and it wasn't from the broth. The fries were ok. I noticed they put all the long fries on top and left us with crumbs on the bottom. Really?   So my friend excused herself to the ladies room as I continued working to try and find a mussel with meat (the mussels were ok too, not fabulous). I'm not joking here...THREE PEOPLE asked if they could dump my empty mussel bowl...THREE PEOPLE! There were only like 4 more mussels to finish. I had to shoo them away. The guy sitting next to me even made a comment and I said this was something like a Seinfield episode (leave me to my mussels!). Lol!   FINALLY, I finished and they were so happy to take my empty mussel shells away. Wow, had you given me the attention upon my arrival, Meat and Potatoes, I might not have wrote this review.  All in all, Meat and Potatoes is like a really hot guy: yes, you're hot and nice to look at, but very shallow, snobby and conceited. Yes, their food is good, but you better pair that with outstanding service, which we did not receive. With you being in business for all this time and with other restaurants giving stellar service, you should know better by now, Meat and Potatoes-hence the 2 stars."}
{"text":"Condescending staff at reservation desk, rude waitress  Great mac n cheese appetizer Tuna tacos were overly salty and inedible Salmon was cooked well but the seasoning on the kimchi was odd and distracting  Very overrated restaurant Spend your money at one of Pittsburgh's better restaurants with more considerate staff"}
{"text":"Excellent drinks and food. Service has always been friendly and professional. Very comfortable atmosphere to eat and drink. I prefer to sit at the bar. If you sit at a table, your table might be right beside the next table. The drinks are some of the best in Pittsburgh. They make their own simple syrups.  Brunch is fantastic. I love the Bloody Mary Bar."}
{"text":"Visited once awhile back and have been craving to go back. Food was absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Wow!!! First time to Pitt...first time here, next trip to Pitt, no way I'm skipping this place! Their Bone Marrow dish...mind blowing good!!!! I had the Wagyu for dinner...great quality steak and the sauce they paired it up with was amazing and packed with flavor!!!"}
{"text":"This is my first time in Pittsburgh to see a football game and decided to go out to Meat & Potatoes for dinner our last night. We completely dominated the food here. It was phenomenal.   Ordered the muscles with cured bacon they were very clean and delicious, I hated muscles for the longest time and tried them here and are half the plate. For the entree I ordered the Hudson Valley Duck Breast when I've never eaten duck before and I loved it. It was cooked perfectly with pastrami and chimichurri sauce.   Great combination of art food and people! Next I will trying their second restaurant, The Butcher and the Rye."}
{"text":"Went here with coworkers last night while visiting PGH. Great atmosphere and staff. Cheese plate and mushroom risotto is excellent. Wagyu beef is also outstanding - diverse menu but lots of familiar items that make it tough to decide! Definitely check it out if in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"The food here definitely did not disappoint. Started off with the tartare, which we had never tried before. I was slightly taken aback when we were asked if we wanted bread with it, which was an extra charge. Not sure how you're supposed to eat it otherwise, but I definitely enjoyed it. I chose the salmon for my entree and it exceeded my expectations. So amazingly flavorful, I'd have to say it's the best salmon dish I've ever had. My only complaint about this place is the seating. I understand they have a small space to work with but the tables are extremely tiny and very close. It's almost awkward when another couple is seated beside you and there is essentially no table room left once the plates arrive."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I had the ribeye and it was probably falls the top 3 ribeye I have ever had all over the USA. It was moist, very flavorful, service was awesome, drinks was great."}
{"text":"The place lives up to expectations! Great food, and the bloody mary bar is out of this world."}
{"text":"Steak for two was really good. Devils on horseback a rare treat. Seating a little close, or cozy if your in the mood. Haha"}
{"text":"Took my girl here for her 21st, wrote it on the online reservation. They gave us both free glasses of Champagne. The beer I ordered tapped out when my glass was 3/4ths of the way full, they let me have it for free.  It was PGH restaurant week. Had strawberry watermelon gespatcho, pulled pork on cornbread, pork tacos with pickled cabbage and maple syrup, and a hot pecan desert. All courses were fantastic.   I like the atmosphere, steampunk/industrial/country blend, with info graphics on cuts of beef.   If your in the cultural district I'd check it out."}
{"text":"Excellent, just simply excellent at every visit.  I've done full mix-n-match dinners with my friends (fried pickles, seviche, tacos, flatbread) and it was delicious.  My husband adores his steaks (perfectly cut, prepared and cooked) so much that he just can't bring himself to order any other plate. Every entree I try is just as good as the last and the desserts never disappoint, if I have enough room left for them.  It's a pleasure to dine here."}
{"text":"Another GREAT night of dining in Pittsburgh. Believe it or not, you can do very well here without ordering red meat. Me and my 2 guests had salmon and duck entrees w/pierogies, a delicious flatbread starter with roasted mushrooms and truffle, and watermelon and Waldorf salads. Music selection was terrible, but the food made me forget it momentarily. Really \"Car Wash\" from the 70s in the background?"}
{"text":"The only reason I gave this place 2 star's is because it is very trendy. .a cool place.  As the food and the service goes don't waste your time! This place will not get any more of my hard earned money. ......."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday night and the place was packed as always.  The seating is super tight but the food and service were fantastic.  We had a fresh tomato salad and bone marrow. I've had it other places but this is the best.  They do it really well."}
{"text":"This is the best place to go in Pittsburgh for brunch by far. The food is awesome I've tried basically the entire brunch menu and everything is absolutely delicious. The drinks are great. If you like Bloody Mary's they have an entire make it yourself section to the bar with anything you could ever desire to put in your drink. There is also a really fun atmosphere perfect place to start a Sunday Funday!"}
{"text":"This is a fun place with a decent brunch.  Entrees run on average $14.  There is a really cool Bloody Mary bar and they have infused vodka.  We got there at 1:20 and they would not seat us at a table because they closed at 2, which seemed a little odd.   We are at the bar and the bartender was great.  Music is loud!!   Food was good,  not exceptional.  But it is a fun place."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late dinner since the place seemed cool - and it was! Had the 3 little pigs sandwich, which was awesome.  Bartenders were great, and the service was really quick and attentive. Would go back!"}
{"text":"Greeted promptly. Seated within minutes of our reservation time. Clean table, glassware, and utensils.  Server looked a bit haggard,  not their best effort. But friendly and efficient and knew the menu. I ask tricky questions, just to be a brat. Sometimes.  Food delivered by a different person. (Team service is a nice touch)  Apps were delicious. (specially the tartare!) Lamb Neck melted off the fork. Pappardelle pasta was savory and luscious. We didn't have dessert. I had a beer and still water. Companion had a Vieux Carre. (above average)  When we go out to eat, we pay attention and ask questions. All the questions. Our server thanked us, (it happens a lot) for participating in the success of OUR meal.  (PRO TIP: actively engage your waiter/waitress/bartender, etc.. they aren't mind readers.)  SIDENOTE: The review by the \"Yelpster\" who mentioned the bathroom \"nightmare\" intrigued us. We made a point of checking out this \"HORRIBLE SITUATION.\"  Do not be frightened. The bathrooms are part of the theater complex and in the SHARED lobby for the restaurant. They were spotlessly clean and obviously well maintained."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Great beer. Can host a business dinner or a date night. Prepare your carnivorous desires and stay a while for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews, I had 4 star expecations but walked away with 3 stars.   Started off with the fried brussels that were just o.k.  I was expecting nice green-crispy brussels but received greesy brown brussels instead.  I thought they were overcooked so I asked the waitress if the brussels are normally cooked this way and she said yes.    On to the maincourse - I ordered the Pub Burger (medium) that looked wonderful upon arrival but was cooked closer to Well and was way too salty for my liking.  My guess is that the pork belly was the main culprit for the salty burger.  Let's just say I had order envy of my wife and friends meals.  The pork dinner and chicken pot pie were tasty but the mussels (beer sauce) were just above average.  If you want good Mussels go to Pt. Brugge.    All in all a decent place but I would not rank in the top 3 in the 'Burgh as others have noted."}
{"text":"Went for brunch and ordered the short rib hash with horseradish hollandaise. Divine! Even better paired with a strawberry basil cocktail. My husband ordered peanut butter pancakes, which were a special that day, not normally on the menu. We will be back if we're ever back in PGH."}
{"text":"Do not go here, ever.  Service was rude and offensive.  Arrived 15 minutes early and we told our table wasnt ready and to have a drink at the bar. Okay, I understand that except for the fact there were 5 or 6 empty tables for 2 within eyesight of the bar.  Twenty minutes later went to the desk and, guess what, they took us to one of those empty tables!  Not only that they brought us to one of the postage sized tables jammed between two others.  When I asked for another open table slightly hammed, and open of course, nope that was reserved by somesomeone else. Give me a break.  End of story walked out, git a huge table at Ten Penny ip the street and had great meal."}
{"text":"Great place, loved the atmosphere. I had the chicken and waffles which were great but hard to eat with fork and knife. Also, loved the DJ. If anyone knows his name message me back, I was there 1/11 for brunch."}
{"text":"The food here is great! I was worried when I tried the salmon that it would be lacking compared to my husband's beef dish, but I was wrong! They seem to spend a lot of time crafting every item on their menu, regardless of the protein. The only thing we didn't like is that seating is tight. We kept apologetically jostling purses and limbs with another couple at the table next to us."}
{"text":"Not sure how I could have been happier. Awesome place. It was packed when I walked in on a Wednesday evening, but found a place at the bar and Molly took great care of me from the beginning. Others pitched in as soon as I needed anything. I had a veal cheek special over kale with pickled vegetables, and fried okra . It was awesome. Great teamwork, outstanding service, fresh, interesting food, good beer specials and well chosen wine list. Highly recommend! Short walk from where i was staying at the Doubletree."}
{"text":"Overall review (Bad, OK, Good): Food = Good; Service = Good; Ambience = Good  Being a transplant from the NYC area, this place gives off a NYC feel.  No matter what day of the week it's bustling.    Food: On my first visit, my party guest and I shared the ribeye for two.  It came with bone marrow which was okay.  I like bone marrow but the consistency of this one didn't work for me, the gratin style wasn't working for me with the marrow.  The ribeye also came with a side of fries.  Additionally, we ordered a side of fried brussel sprouts.  The sides were ordinary, nothing special.  On my second visit, I ordered the moules w/white wine and frites.  The balance of flavors was right on.  The portion size was generous.  If there was a negative - and it really technically wasn't a negative - was that they put chorizo with the moules.  Service: Attentive enough not to be overbearing; friendly.  Ambience: Very lively.  Music is a bit loud but makes for the energetic atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great drink menu.  Try the Manhatten.  Everything we ate was very unique, and delicious.  The pimento mac and cheese app was cooked perfect.  We also had the flat iron steak and lamb.  Flat iron is normally code speak for cheap piece of meat, but this was a one inch thick cooked perfectly meal. A negative:  your neighbor table is very close to you."}
{"text":"Cool trendy little spot in downtown Pittsburgh. We started with the fried brussle sprouts which were different but suprisingly good. For entrees my wife and I had the Pork chop and the chicken. The pork chop was very well prepared and definitely not recommended for someone who's not hungry as its huge. The chicken was tasteful tender and juicy. My only complaint is the round tables tend to be on the small side and can make eating slightly uncomfortable if you have more than two plates and drinks."}
{"text":"grab a seat at the bar, eat some great food and down some delicious drinks...great atmosphere & staff"}
{"text":"This was my second time here.  The food is great -- I have had the steak and meatloaf sandwich; both excellent.  Fried Brussels Sprouts were quite good.  My wife had the short ribs which she loved.  The atmosphere is smart and snappy, but still friendly and inviting.  My  only criticism--the greeter did not greet or acknowledge everyone who was waiting.  Before she went \"in\" to take a party to a table, she should have at least minimally acknowledged the rest of the people there.  Hostesses are known by their hospitality."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, exquisite presentation of drinks and each plate was spectacular. The bloody Mary bar is amazing, and wonderful if you like all sorts of options! I had brunch and remember having many dishes, none of wish I recall the name of, but each was incredible well advertised and really delicious."}
{"text":"Overall is good but nothing special. We ordered mussel, bone marrow, Brussels, lamb neck, burgher, pasta and a kind of fish. The lamb neck and the sauce of the fish is good. It's a good place if you like new American food. You won't regret but you also won't get something out of expect, something make you say amazing.  And the dessert toffee cake is good!"}
{"text":"Omg the shrimp and grits!! It was absolutely amazing. We also got the grilled cheese (we got it to go) and I think it would have been even better if I would have been able to eat it as soon as it was prepared, either way, it was delicious!"}
{"text":"So we were seated directly next to Jbaby S, whose review you can read below. Not only did our experience vary wildly from what they reported, half of what they said was patently false.  Our drinks arrived promptly and were delicious - it's worth noting that the drinks here aren't your standard Jack and Ginger, and perhaps when you have to add an egg white to a mixed drink, it's going to take some time.   The food was good and came to our table quickly. Pro tip, if you wait fifteen minutes after your food is served to eat it, it will be a) cold and b) not the restaurant's fault.   The service - we had Ashlee, the same server - was attentive and friendly. The music was a normal level for a hip restaurant. If you're expecting secluded silence you won't get it, but it wasn't distracting at all.  All in all, we had a great experience from start to finish."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been to Meat & Potatoes, but I've been dreaming about going back since my first visit about a year ago. I made a Saturday night reservation too last minute and ended up in a later time slot than I would have liked (somewhere around 9 or 10 p.m.--I headed there after the symphony instead of before), but when I showed up a little early, they had no problem seating my party of two. The place has a cozy, romantic vibe; if rustic chic is a thing, that's a fitting term for the décor. I had the soft shell tacos (soft shell crab, pickled carrots, cucumber salad, mint, cilantro, Thai chili sauce; $14) and Sgt. Peppers Old Fashioned (Bulleit bourbon, black pepper, thyme, lemon, whiskey bitters; $9), both of which made the most of the many flavors involved. While I'm not much of a cocktail person, I do love a good Old Fashioned, and they did it justice. Ultimately, it was probably for the best that my reservation was nudged out of peak time, because the relaxed atmosphere and attentive-yet-casual service ended up being just the right mix for the end of an evening."}
{"text":"Fabulous brunch!  Some of the best, different brunch food we've ever had, along with delicious Sunday cocktails.   Tasty sausage, brisket, and eggs!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Every single dish my friends and I tried was great. But some of them are like small portion and some of them are huge. I love the duck breast."}
{"text":"Considering the name I figured they would have some obvious meat and potato options on the menu and was very disappointed. Ordered the Waygu Flat Iron and portion sizes for my meal and other guests were incredibly small considering the prices. $12 Mac and cheese entree came with short ribs on it and was a larger portion than all of the entrees.   Food was extremely salty and not very flavorful.   Also, the restaurant is very small with tables so close surrounding the bar that you cannot pass somebody if you are coming or going and servers clog up the aisles. It is really more of a bar with some hgher-end, higher-prices bar/grill type items."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch on a long drive back to DC from the Great Lakes state. It was pretty amazing. The fried taters with truffle oil were incredible, and the corned beef hash was the perfect rib-sticking breakfast to fuel me for a long trip. My companion enjoyed the melt-in-your-mouth brisket and eggs, as well as the Bloody Mary bar. Our waitress made the second one, as we had just received our food--she seemed to know the perfect mix.  Seems like a place that gets quite busy on Sundays, so get there early or make a res. It lives up to these reviews, and the price is really perfect for the food you receive."}
{"text":"Been there a few times now, and the place has not let me down as of yet!  Food is great!  Mussels of the day is always on my order.  Last time I went, I had to try the Meat for Two, but the sheer quantity of the meat put me in a food coma.  Tried to finish after waking from the coma, but still could not.  Was delicious before and after I passed out."}
{"text":"Had the flat iron steak. It was cooked perfectly and the sauces and flavor of the steak were amazing!  Service was good even on a crowded Friday night."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place, but it's yet another crowded and overpriced downtown restaurant. The entrees are largely flavorless, so I don't know how they justify their prices. To top it off, the service is largely disinterested and makes you feel like a burden if bothered to answer menu questions."}
{"text":"I would recommend Meat and Potatoes to anyone looking for a great dining experience.  The food was superb and the staff was AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"Beware your reservations here. Front of the house has some work to do.   My sister booked the private room 6 weeks ago for combined Father's Day/birthday brunch celebration. When she didn't get confirmation, she called yesterday and was told it wasn't on file. (Reservation was taken by phone, not online.)  My sis asked if restaurant could do anything to make up for the error. Hostess said no."}
{"text":"A famous restaurant. Good service, very juicy and tender steak. While, the beer collection is not so good. Almost only canned beers are available (I just saw one beer tap there, which is not on the menu)."}
{"text":"I was pretty sure that no place in the 'Burgh would supplant Park Bruges as my favorite brunch spot, but Meat & Potatoes makes it close.  I love the layout of the restaurant - outdoor seating, but indoors the center of the room is a large bar, with the tables in the periphery.  To top it off, the chairs have high backs, and are the most comfortably dining chairs I've sat in.  That sounds stupid, but it was enough for me to notice.  The food was fantastic.  There is a nice touch to start, in that they bring an oversized, fresh, blueberry muffin.   This muffin has the perfect, sugary and crunchy top.  And definitely share the short ribs hash for the table.  We ordered nearly ever brunch entree, and everyone was happy: Pub Burger, Fried Chicken and Cheddar Jalapeno Waffles, a BPBLT (a gourmet BLT with pastrami belly).  The portions are quite sizeable, so bring your appetite.  Service was equally great.  I always enjoy it when the staff are also foodies, and get excited about the menu items, have actually tried the menu and drinks, and offer educated recommendations.  I'm definitely looking forward to coming back for a dinner service."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went here after we saw a show downtown. I had heard great things about M&P and was super excited. However, I was pretty disappointed with my experience.  I got the lamb burger and my girlfriend got the duck.  The lamb burger was not good. I thought the meat was spongy and didn't taste fresh. I was pretty sad, since I was expecting to be blown away.  The duck, however, was delicious. It was very well cooked. The skin was nice and crispy and the meat was tender. The plate came in three parts on a long plate. A salad, pierogies, and the duck. The flavors from each were good on their own, but to me, they felt like three separate dishes. I didn't feel any unifying theme between them.  Perhaps it was my fault that I didn't get the steak. I think I will try again someday in the future."}
{"text":"Food was good & service was very attentive. However, the bartenders need to learn how to make a proper Manhattan.  Also, the upholstery on the banquette needs some serious attention."}
{"text":"I had the Pub Burger and it was one of the best burgers I've ever had. When I travel, I try to hit the best burger joint in each city. In Pittsburgh, that is supposed to be Winghart's. I'm going to try that tomorrow but they definitely have their work cut out for them if they want to compete with the burger at Meat & Potatoes. For some reason, this place really reminds me of the Purple Pig in Chicago."}
{"text":"Meat & Potatoes has really yummy food.  My wife and I tried the specialty mushroom risotto, bone marrow flat bread, mushroom flatbread and the salmon.  They were all delicious.  This restaurant reminds of me a similar restaurant in Los Angeles that Iron Chef Mario Batali owns, called Mozza.  I must say, the server kept making mistakes with our food and brought out things that we didn't order, but that wasn't a big deal.  We loved this place and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This was our second trip to Meat & Potatoes.  Both have been verey good, just short of excellent.  Service was friendly, and though the tables are very close to each other, somehow it works in this place.  Perhaps it is the overall gregarious atmosphere.  Now to the food...  We started with 3 apps: (1) The grilled bread was great as always.  Great value at $3, always perfectly toasted, with superb butter and jam.  (2) Mushroom flatbread ($12) - also great, just as good as the shortrib flatbread we had last time.  Portions are generous.  (3) Yellowtail cerviche - This was the one downside, and it was pretty far down.  It was $12, and had 6 little scrapings of yellowtail.  All I could thing of was \"margins\" as I was eating this - it must be 90%+.  Also, while the sauce around the scraps of yellowtail were good, there was nothing to get it up with.  I asked the waiter about it, and he offered a spoon instead of bread.  With so many other good things on the menu that are tasty and filling, I highly recommend you avoid this menu item.  My wife had a pasta (farfelle) with shortrib and pork shoulder ($18) - so excellent!  I then had a burger with pimento cheese toppings, which was outstanding - meat to bun.  Also, the fries it came with were perfect - all only $12.  Finally, we sampled 3 different drinks - their signature bourbon cocktail, and two vodka based cocktails.  All were great, and all cost $10.  There was just enough alcohol and overall flavor in them to justify the price.  Overall, Meat & Potatoes continues to please.  Other than the yellowtail app, they are avoiding overly \"shi-shi-ing\" themselves by providing hearty, innovative food and drink at a moderate price."}
{"text":"Claustrophobics should avoid this place, since there is very little space between tables. A large bar takes up the entire center of the restaurant, leaving little space for tables along the periphery. Because of the tight spacing and because this is a popular, crowded restaurant, it gets very loud. Many people like that. We, however, had been hoping for a quieter, more sedate atmosphere. On the positive side, the food was very good, though you should be aware that the portions are small and you should order accordingly. Three of us had the black bass, which made us wish we had ordered an appetizer or salad with it. One of us had a burger, which came with a side of Brussels sprouts and was more filling. The lemon berry pie was delicious, but we were a bit disappointed it had berry jam instead of actual berries. The service was quick and pleasant. Meat & Potatoes is very conveniently located to the major cultural venues, right next to the Cabaret, steps from the O'Reilly, and a short walk from the Benedum and Heinz Hall.  Although we enjoyed the food, we didn't like being crammed into a small space. In the future, this will be lower on my list of pre-show places to eat."}
{"text":"OBJECTIVELY GOOD FOOD BUT MEDIOCRE AT BEST: Food: 3 / 5 Service: 5 / 5 Atmosphere: 3.5 / 5 Price: 3.5 / 5 Overall: 3.75 / 5  I've been here twice now. Many of my friends have been quite often and we had a discussion about why we don't really like Meat & Potatoes.  FOOD: The consensus between my friends and me is that we always feel heavy, lethargic and weighed down after eating here. Meaning, the food here is greasier than you think and very very salty.  Because they season the meat with many other flavors and spices, you don't actually notice how salty the food is until you go through all the water and STILL feel thirsty. Since the dishes draw many nice flavors, the food is definitely objectively good but really not special. Also, they used to give HUGE portions and it was really worth the money. Now, the portions are average American portions (which as we all know are still quite big). Don't waste your money here, go to the two brother restaurants Butcher and the Rye or Tako, which are outstanding!  SERVICE: Waiters are fast, friendly, and knowledgeable.  ATMOSPHERE: It's nice inside but the tables are small and you're seated really closely to the surrounding tables which gives way to overhearing awkward conversations/not enough elbow room.  Price: Not worth the quality of food."}
{"text":"Great place to be on a Sunday afternoon.  Their short rib hash is delicious and their bloody mary bar is worth trying with one of their infused vodkas (e.g. bacon!).  My friend had the Irish benedict and the hubby had the huevos rancheros which they both liked.  The smoked brisket flatbread was only okay and lacked flavor.  Make sure you make reservations, this place is small but always packed for brunch.  There are different DJs that play on Sunday and when the weather is warm they have seating outside."}
{"text":"Went there twice before and wasn't impressed but I'm glad we tried it again. Get the macaroni and cheese appetizer. The waygu and the salmon entrees were great. I asked them to make me a drink that tastes like flowers and it was really great."}
{"text":"I really do love the atmosphere here. They serve you food on metal lunch trays which super cool. Although I'm a vegetarian, I still like it here. There are a few options for me on the menu for us non meat eaters, not many tho and a good wine selection."}
{"text":"We had the brussel sprouts appetizer and I must say I was very disappointed! It was very greasy and burnt, hardly any flavor. WOULD NOT GET AGAIN! Everything else was ok, but nothing to brag on. If I ever did return it only be to try the bone marrow."}
{"text":"*****Excellent restaurant***** Make reservations. It's so much more sophisticated than its name might suggest. Certainly a top notch place for any gourmand. The bone marrow and duck are absolutely fantastic."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is delicious and they serve it late. The pork chop is sooo good! And delicious mussels, and the pate! They also have great brunch and the best drinks around. A bit pricey but worth it, and the bartenders are super friendly."}
{"text":"I wanted to take a minute to write a little something about M&P. The food was good... no it was great but that is only partially the reason why I decided to write a review.   We had a reservation at 8:30pm and waited about 30 minutes longer after that. They were so apologetic and had one of their parties prior to us run a little late. They definitely took care of us with some of their best appetizers on the house. Sometimes, you can appreciate a restaurant or business going above and beyond for their customers, which is really why I get a 5 star review. The service goes a really long way for me.    Now, on to the highlights of the meal:  The best of the starters we had was the Bone Marrow. The only way to describe it is in one word: butter. The fried pickles and  Fried Brussels I could couple together. Both were not overly breaded, which I enjoy, and still crunchy.   The entrée is what stole the show for me. I had the Duck Breast and it was probably some of the best duck I have ever had in my life.   All in all, I would definitely go back to Meat & Potatoes if I am back in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"A friend from work highly recommended this gastropub. I am thankful for the open table app because making reservations was a breeze. We were seated immediately and everyone was surprised by how busy the restaurant was. The massive beer selection was written above the bar. My cousin and my dad ordered two appetizers for the table the bone marrow which was grilled bread, gremolata, and onion relish. The mussels of the day was the second appetizer. For our main course the guys ordered burgers, my mum ordered a salad, and I ordered the short rib flatbread pizza. The food and brews were excellent. We were all satiated and I  will be checking out meat and potatoes again!"}
{"text":"Great food, almost too large of portions and great service from the young and energetic wait staff.   Get your reservation in early as the place packs full."}
{"text":"Love the food and Brussel sprouts but the drinks are awesome. Try some off of the prohibition list."}
{"text":"Phenomenal!  The Devils on Horseback made for an awesome light snack, the bone marrow was excellent but the 34 oz. ribeye stole the show."}
{"text":"Prohibition cocktails and Cuban sandwich over lunch. Clearly one of the best bartenders in the city. A little pricey, but worth it. Man food galore. Bring the boyfriend!"}
{"text":"You HAVE to try the Bone Marrow. Just do it. It's one of the most nutritious tasty treats you can give yourself.   The Wagyu beef was perfectly prepared and melted in my mouth. The chefs know exactly what they're doing and the wait staff are there for you during your whole experience.  I'd recommend the Grande Absinthe to top off the evening.  Cheers."}
{"text":"Only had take out, but the interior is cool if you can find a place to sit. I ordered the duck and took it back to my hotel room, pretty pretty good.  Get the duck medium rare.   Nothing to dislike.  End of transcript."}
{"text":"Fun hipster vibe/decor.  Everything we ordered was quite salty but overall the burger and eggs benedict were tasty.  We brought our two kids under 4, which was totally doable but a bit tricky because they have no high chairs and tables are small and made of marble.  But the big booths are comfy and perfect for families or couples.  Service was quick even on busy Sunday and staff was pleasant.  Will deinitely return."}
{"text":"I give Meat & Potatoes 3 stars simply because of the small atmosphere and smaller tables. If possible, I'd give the food a 4 star rating alone but, you gotta take everything into consideration when dining at a restaurant!   I went to M&P with my dad before a show, we we're expecting the small date-night-like tables and quite frankly felt a little uncomfortable with how close everyone was next to us.   With that being said the food however, was delicious. Well flavored and came out beautifully presented. The servers were knowledgeable and the bus boys knew they had to clear those small tables quick!"}
{"text":"Amazing spot!  Staff was prepared for our reservation, atmosphere was a buzz, food was spectacular. Bone marrow, mussels, and salmon main were all raved about."}
{"text":"Great food, unique menu, amazing steak.  Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Not sure what all they hype is about. Average service if that and GOOD food. I would return but not fight for a seat in the place. ***amending due to my lack of insight earlier and being called out for it.... the space is quite nice and trendy.  Good city spot - but there is no manager presence and they are really not focused on great service! Good to be in the theater district i guess!  Took a seat at the bar before a show! good crowd, lots of energy!  The menu is innovative, and very tavern-ish in some ways... i.e. great place to get a good drink and eat something!  just a good ol steak with a  potato is what i was expecting, sorry I was born and raised in these parts! took the name too literally..it is worth mentioning that burger (which is something i would prefer to make at home!) was good. Salad and flat bread were good. Service is where they took a hit with me; just not very customer focused - i was left to feel that i wasn't a recognizable face in the crowd -one drink in a 80 minute period???  a bartender (all of 23 maybe) was more interested in how he was holding his bar spoon and stirring than actually preparing drinks... let alone the 7 minutes to make one drink while telling a gentleman next to us that he was a master mixologist and blah blah blah blah... maybe if you had a grey hair kid you could pull that shtick off but your knowledge of bourbon and scotch (good job reading) is limited and you need to keep your ego in check!  You haven't been alive long enough to know that much!  Make my drink and ask me if i would like another before my drink is empty and its time to leave!  I guess it was forbiden that one of the 42 other people behind the bar hep us!  please note - he made good drink, but anyone can be taught to measure and stir! WAS that detailed enough team? Food Quality = GOOD (not my style of meat and potatoes)  Service = below average for the price point overall 3.5 but gave them 4!"}
{"text":"Great place! Fast and friendly service! Food is amazing! The steak was rich and cooked perfectly and the potatoes were confit and the best I HAVE EVER HAD! Marrow bone was a tasty addition. The atmosphere is spacious yet feels cozy. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service as well, highly recommended.  I had a very positive experience and was more than pleased with my meal.  Heard good things about meat & potatoes from several friends, so I thought to give it a try this trip to Pgh.  I came as a walk in and didn't have reservations (it was a tuesday night) so I was offered to order at the bar, full menu.  I had bone marrow, a good portion served and with the toppings it was excellent.   Pot roast was the best I've had in my life.  I believe it was a chuckroast with carrots, other vegetables and whipped potatoes with a very savory sauce - I finished every last bite (which is rare, usually taking home a doggie bag.)  I have no idea what was in it, but the flavoring was amazingly tasty.  The pot roast was tender and no difficulty eating.  I finished my meal with the chocolat pot au creme, a mousse like pudding, which personally I thought was a nice finish after a bit of a heavy meal.  I had a cup of coffee to end my meal, espresso was not on the menu.    I will be back, to try the mushroom risotto, pork chops and the meat & potatoes for two - heard rave reviews about the latter."}
{"text":"Meat and Potatoes does not normally disappoint I have dined there often, and the food and service are always excellent. EXCEPT, tonight I tried the collards, and they were so far off the traditional that I could not eat them.  They were sweet and sticky and, not to get too technical, just plain yucky. Sorry, fellas, but I will be back."}
{"text":"The food here is unbelievably awesome!! Love the ambience , music and the service . Everyone here is so friendly and polite. I will definitely be back here the next time I visit Pittsburg!!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, love the over-the-top \"meat culture\" shtick on the menu and in the decor!  This joint, right smack in the groin of the Cultural District, has a huge lively bar yet is still comfortably appointed for foursomes on the perimeter.  We had two awesome appetizers - the Escolar (a seviche) and the Watermelon Salad, with feta, olives and a lime vinaigrette.  The main course was a nice try, but not a perfect 10 on execution: Soft Shell Tacos, consisting of soft shell crab, pickled carrots and cucumber salad, cilantro and Thai chili sauce.  The taste combination was interesting but I found the tartness of the pickled carrots overpowered the poor crab, who showed up dutifully for work, all dressed up, and ended up with a little desk near the file room.  But, hey, perhaps that's what I get for ordering crab at a \"meat\" place ... sometimes you have to take credit for your own poor choices.  I still approve of this joint, and I love that you can still find a meal downtown at 10pm on a weeknight amid the hustle and bustle of the Pittsburgh theater jet-set."}
{"text":"We stopped in before seeing a show and will be back. The restaurant had such a unique atmosphere and the breakfast was outstanding. I look forward to trying their Korean BBQ at some point. Our waitress seemed a little out of sorts and started talking to a customer next to us who was an awkward acquaintance, which was distracting for us seeing as how close the tables are. Overall an excellent experience."}
{"text":"I can not say enough good things about this restaurant. I took my mother, mother in law and sister in law here for brunch this morning and I think I had one of the single best meals of my life.   We each ordered a bloody mary and thoroughly enjoyed the huge bloody mary bar with endless fixins and various infused vodkas. Absolutely delicious.  I ordered the french toast breakfast and it was sublime. The sourdough bread makes for a substantive yet fluffy toast. The warm bananas and bacon almond brittle added a sweet/savory contrast. I couldn't get enough. The chicken and waffles were ginormous. Half of one chicken fried and served over a cheddar and jalapeno waffle. You'll take some home. It's that huge. Sister said it was phenomenal. MIL ordered the quiche of the day. It looked like a slice of cheesecake. It was huge! The eggs were fluffy and the quiche itself was flavorful. Mom got the lobster omelet. It looked amazing and mom sure cleaned her plate! We had vanilla creme brulee and maple tiramisu for dessert. Both dishes were rich, creamy and delicious.  I will be going back for brunch very soon and very often. This is now my favorite restaurant in town!!"}
{"text":"We chose this place for a special birthday dinner for the hubby.  I was so sorry I did.  The food was really grossly salty, and I like salt.  We also felt it was way overpriced and the service was terrible.  From the oh so enjoyable room temperature water, to the appetizer order not being placed, then when we did get it finally, the appetizer plates were never removed, and when the dinner came, it was served on a wooden slab and we were not given plates to use. I had to reach over the app plates to even get to the wooden slab. So messy.  The salt content left me feeling sickly.  We will not be back.  The stars I did award were for the drinks, which were refreshing. This restaurant really has a reputation of serving delicious food, guess things have definitely changed after a couple of successful years."}
{"text":"Meat & Potatoes is in a primte location caddy corner from the Benedum Center and in the same building as the Cabaret Theater.  It's a gastropub, which can be bad is done poorly, but this is a pretty good example of how it can be done well.  They normally have a burger special, which is usually what I end up ordering.  They had one that was basically a burger and a pulled pork sandwhich combined together with an onion ring on top... Wow.  The craft beer list is long and reasonably priced.  Great location and good food.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Food was fantastic. The tartare was exceptional....if you are debating between it and the bone marrow for an appetizer, don't: it comes served on top of a bone filled with delicious marrow. One gripe, I purposefully seek \"gastropubs\" for the food typical of them, but also for a high-end beer selection which defines a gastropub as such. Meat and Potatoes fails on this front. Half of their beers are the type you find in big box grocers (Miller, Pabst, Tecate, Molson, etc,). The other half are domestic craft beers, none of which are particularly notable.  No belgian beers, no imports (unless you count the big corporate beers like Stella Artois and Boddingtons), and NO BEERS  ON DRAFT. This is sort of a requirement for a pub, much less a gastropub. However, if you are into the mixology, high-end cocktail scene, this place has you covered."}
{"text":"We had a nice time here.  The atmosphere is similar to a speakeasy.  We did not have reservations and elected to eat at the bar.  The menu was the same and the bartender was very nice.  We were there for more than an hour and never felt rushed.  They have a good selection of beers and specialty drinks.  Food is good at modest prices.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Delicious food- friend pickles are to die for-   Awesome bartenders and cocktails    Must try their Monday Night Cap! With $5 snacks and awesome drink specials!"}
{"text":"This place solidified my desire to relocate to Pittsburgh. Yes, it's that good.  My boyfriend and I were considering moving to the Steel City after reading some impressive articles about the area. We were stumbling around downtown Pittsburgh in an uncomfortable rain/wind/ohgreatnowmyumbrellaisinverted situation and this place was a beacon of hope!   Considering how busy it was, we didn't have to wait long at all-- no more than 20 minutes and they have a really comfortable, intimate seating area while you're waiting for a table to open up. We ended up in a great conversation with a friendly local and the time flew by.   Once we were seated we could see why this establishment has such rave reviews. The staff is amazing. My boyfriend and I couldn't help remarking on how kind and helpful *every* employee was. There was none of that ~avoid eye contact so you don't have to answer a question~ on the part of the employees. Providence has some great, independent restaurants but I often get the impression that I'm burdening the staff by asking for anything extra...even water. While every establishment we visited in our two and a half days in Pittsburgh featured unusually kind (by New England standards), Meat and Potatoes truly stood out.  Oh, yeah, and the meal was phenomenal. I'm not a \"~*~foodie~*~*,\" but I'd like to think I haven't completely destroyed my palette by overindulging in packaged Ramen. This is some of the best food I've ever had. We started off with the lobster macaroni and cheese and we stopped and looked at each other...we may have even been salivating. This was beyond good. It was rich and hearty and while the portion was appetizer sized, it could easily be a meal in itself because of its density and richness. I don't even like crustaceans!  For our main dishes, my boyfriend had the mussels and chose the curry sauce (they had two other options but they escape me :/) and I had the pork belly tacos. For nearly our whole meal we kept nodding and eating, staring wide-eyed at each other in contentment. I didn't sample any of his dish but he tried some of mine and we can both vouch for its deliciousness. The sesame seed crema was the perfect addition. Again, this meal was very rich (no complaints here) so come hungry.  It's rare that I write a review anymore but the service at Meat and Potatoes (as amazing as the food was) compelled me to. Our first impression of Pittsburgh was a great one and we look forward to making Meat and Potatoes our spot in the coming months."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff. Offered to find me a spot around a very busy bar. Bartender was super friendly and made a great Manhattan and a great Old-fashioned. Decent whiskey list IMO. Appetizer and cob salad were great starters and the smoked lamb shank was down right the best thing I have had in a long time. Great clean experience. Would recommend to anyone looking for a nice meal."}
{"text":"Hard to beat this place.  Food is excellent, great scene, place is very nice inside.  Only thing I could possibly say is that it's on the expensive side, but not enough to take away a star"}
{"text":"The food is always top notch, the bar man is charming at attentive, and service is usually pretty smooth. My only critique would be that the restaurant seating is a little awkward. Every time I go in I opt to sit at the bar so I don't get crammed in side-by-side with another table. Also, if you haven't tried absinthe, do it! It takes a few minutes to prepare, but it's delicious. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Personally?Rosted chicken doesnt taste better than the 5 dollar roasted chicken I bought from Kroger?just personally."}
{"text":"Love this place! We usually end up here before or after theatre. Great cocktails and food. If you have not been here, it is a must. There is not a bad choice on the menu."}
{"text":"Fantastic resturant! Easily one of my favorites in the 'Burgh. Always has a deliciously unique menu that features many of my favorites. I personally reccommend the steak tartar."}
{"text":"I like Meat & Potatoes. I've been there several times but I just went for brunch, so let me write about that.   I had a daily special which was the pork belly with savory oats, fruit kimchi and a fried egg. This is one of the more unusual dishes that I've tried there, and it really worked for me. The rich pork balanced well with the acid in the kimchi.  I sampled some of my dining companions' choices as well and enjoyed most of their dishes. I tried the brisket flatbread, which was excellent; the eggnog French toast, which was good but didn't really excite me; and the sausage and biscuit (another daily special). That last one. Man. It was oversalted. Like: Dead Seas oversalted. It was sent back and quickly replaced with something more enjoyable. The coffee was good too.   Service was good but sort of... hover-y. Plates were removed from the table as soon as the last bite was consumed (or prior to in one case) . Almost all the serving staff has an earpiece which gives the place a bit of a Secret Service feel---not the most relaxing vibe for a lazy Saturday brunch.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We stopped here to have a bite to eat before a CLO performance this summer.  The restaurant was filled to capacity, even though it was a weekday, so we sat at the bar.  We ordered the special tomato salad and the risotto. Both dishes were absolutely fresh and delightful to our taste buds!  It was just enough food for us and we were very satisfied!  The bartender was also very friendly, he took our order with very little wait time, and came back to us several times to make sure we were satisfied!  Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"By far the best bartender in the burgh..Ryan from meat and potatoes..amazing mixologist that truly knows his mixes inside and out. Wow!!! Thank you for such a great time Ryan for your attention to detail!! I told you what I liked and you went above and beyond!!! Definitely will be back time and time again!!!:)"}
{"text":"Meh. This place shares their restrooms with the Cabaret theater, but somehow convinced themselves that they're way better than they actually are. I don't get the hype. I live around the block from here and so I've tried this place, I'd say, about 20 times in the last year. I've only had a descent experience once. Why come back if it's so terrible? Because they are open on Sunday and Monday when most places downtown are closed. And being from Nyc I love going to my neighborhood spots. Also, my husband loves their papadelle. If only they treated their customers well. Everyone that works here thinks they're to good to be there, and the manger is actually the worst one. We get it. You're a very busy establishment. Doesn't mean you get to treat your customers like crap. Leave your money. There's so many new and better places in pittsburgh to try"}
{"text":"I was traveling and a friend recommended this place.  Food and drink was sublime!!!  A \"must eat\" in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Pittsburgh eateries. Delicious entrees. Even better cocktails. Everything I have tried has been superb quality with a great balance of flavors. Great place to have dinner before you see a show in the Cultural District, the staff will even ask if you have time constraints and make sure you are not late for your play/concert. Always make a reservation, this place is usually busy on the weekends."}
{"text":"Four of us ate the bar. The food was excellent - pub burger, pork chop, tacos and three little pigs- all nicely  prepared and yummy.  Drinks were good.  BUT - Two of three bartenders were rude, condescending, and just plain mean.  One in particular criticized our drinks choices, sneered a lot and was otherwise thought he was very cool - obviously too cool for us.  Compared to NYC bars I have been in this week, the service was much more unfriendly and haughtier here = the attitudes here make this a place I would not recommend to friends- has potential but some new staff is needed.  This experience was totally unexpected especially in Pittsburgh where most people are exceptionally nice.  Worst experience in a Pittsburgh bar- ever!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch, amazing!  Bloody Mary is your choice of infused liqueurs, and a build-your-own Bloody Mary bar which had shrimp, bacon, cured meats, cheese, and a choice of about 20 different kinds of pickled veggies.  We got the chicken and waffles- which came with four huge pieces of fried chicken, and the brisket hash, which was amazing."}
{"text":"My friend and I have a before theatre light meal that I really look forward to. I usually chose a seasonal cocktail, and order from the appetizer or light plates menu. My favorite is the Caesar salad and grilled bread. What fun!."}
{"text":"I just went to Meat and Potatoes this weekend with a group of people. We made the reservations over a month in advance because it is such a small restaurant that it was hard to get in with a group of 10. Between all of us we tried a variety of different things on the menu. Appetizers- the Devils on Horseback were surprisingly good. I didn't think I would like them, but they were probably the best app we had. They has a fried Mac and cheese appetizer special which several people tried and it was nothing to write home about. The corn dog was pretty good, but had some kick to it! For entrees - I got the pot roast, which was pretty good by pot roast standards. The hanger steak was too small of a portion for the meat lover in our group but they said it was great. The pork chop was GIANT and really juicy, but the slaw side that came with it was too spicy for me. And the duck was excellent. Our service was pretty good and the drinks were delicious, but pricey. All in all an exceptional meal, and will go back, but maybe not worth the month and a half of anticipation!"}
{"text":"Amazing food... Good service.  Will definitely be coming back. Best Caesar salad. Waitress very friendly and great martinis.  Overall... Great experience."}
{"text":"This review is based on my experience through several visits to M&P (1 dinner, 2 lunches, and a Sunday brunch).  Overall, the food is decent (good quality but does not always hit the mark for taste). At dinner I would suggest the mussels (delicious). At lunch, avoid the fried pickles appetizer (not as good as the waitress suggested) and fried chicken sandwich. Do not order the brisket on flat bread at brunch (what was I thinking?).  Service is generally slow. On my most recent visit at brunch on Sunday at 1:30 (today) we waited 45 minutes for our food. On the other hand, the waitress was great about making sure my mug was always filled with coffee.  My last complaint is that the furniture is very  uncomfortable. It looks great but makes the legs sore. It's also too low for the height of the tables. The decor is nice.  Overall, M&P is a nice place to try, but I would certainly not call it one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh. It does not live up to the hype."}
{"text":"This is only based on first impressions and service. Unfortunately, we never made it to dinner. And we really wanted too. The hostesses were rude and I'm not sure if they were stoned or just worried about what their hair looked like, but they could have given two sh*ts about us being there. We had a reservation but arrived earlier to see if we could get in. Yeah, not sure they even spoke English. Bar was full, we were 'stalking' some folks about to leave until this 4-some came in, walked right in front of us. Bartenders never ack'd us. Overall, just a rude group of people. I'd like to try again next time. Maybe they'll get some more competent help."}
{"text":"My friends and I shared dinner, appetizers and drinks here and Saturday night and the menu was utterly outstanding.  From the duck liver pate with sauterne jelly to the beef marrow appetizer everything was incredible.  Our group was a little high maintenance too because it kept growing as friends were showing up unexpectedly and yet our server was so patient with us.  We sat outside on their patio and it was a slightly chilly fall evening.  M&P actually offers blankets to patio guests in case they are cold!  Such a unique touch that sets them apart.  I had a lovely glass of barbera which paired beautifully with steak.  I will say the portions here are huge.  I know Americans tend to be big eaters so I am used to healthier, scaled down portions but if you have a hefty appetite then this is probably the place for you.  Wonderful wine list and amazing food.  For dessert I had panna cotta with a ginger blueberry sauce.  Heavenly.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great Sunday brunch at Meat & Potatoes!  Make your own Bloody Mary bar ($5/per) was absolutely delicious, with all the ingredients you need to make a great Bloody. I had the Smoked Salmon flatbread, which was a fun twist on traditional lox & cream cheese, and was just the right amount of food for a Sunday brunch. The rest of the table's meals looked equally delicious, including Chicken & Waffles, Short Rib Hash, and Irish Benedict. Good service, great atmosphere, and I think one of the best brunches in the city."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a drink after a downtown event.  Drinks were very imaginative and delicious.  One in our party tried the most amazing looking grilled cheese.  Corn dog may be the best I have ever tried.  The mussels were good but nothing outstanding.  Server and decor were very casual and inviting.  Would definitely return."}
{"text":"What a delightful brunch!  It took a reservation made several weeks in advance to finally make it but once we were seated in the special \"group room\" and the menus came out, it was clear that the wait was worth it.  To start with, we were enticed by the make-your-own-bloody mary bar with a variety of pickled vegetables and sauces to complement one of the many unique bases.  This was good, but others were happier with their expert-prepared cocktails.  All of the dishes ordered by our group were excellent.  True to the restaurant's name there were about 15% of the items on the menu which were vegetarian options.  However, we enjoyed our meaty offerings:  Chicken and waffles with a uniquely cheesy jalapeno savory waffle, light pancakes deemed \"the best pancakes I've ever had,\" short rib hash, etc.  Come with a group so you can mooch off of others' entrees!"}
{"text":"Great mussels, drinks, and atmosphere. Definitely will need reservations, but the burgers and steaks are worth it."}
{"text":"I love it, the food, the drinks, the atmosphere, my favorite PGH restaurant"}
{"text":"Hmmm...I love meat and potatoes, so when a friend asked me to go there for her birthday I agreed knowing it was super expensive and upscale.  It's also located downtown which equates to #parkingnightmare.  I'd say bus down there, but busing anywhere in Pittsburgh takes an eternity.  I digress.  The food here is awful.  I got some kinda Bolognese Pasta, it tasted like dirty gym socks.  Not kidding.  The presentation was terrible, and it tasted warm as opposed to hot.  I'll do a warm hamburger from a fast food joint because they aren't charging $23, but not warm pasta from a place that has reservations and $50 and up plates.  They charge $5 or some shit for toast, so that's the kinda place this is.  The wine was delicious, but it's hard to mess up red wine for someone who imbibes as regularly as I do.  Had it not been for the wine, and company, I would probably 1 star it, but I'm no high class gal.  The service was ok.  They kept trying to take all of my silverware and plates before I was done with my dishes.  It's like, back up, I'm not even finished eating yet.  And I used to serve tables for a long time, so I know the difference between hovering over a table, and allowing someone to eat and enjoy their company.  Here's the kicker, a friend got the highest priced plate cause he's a baller (unlike myself), and well, it's supposed to come with MASHED POTATOES.  Well, they said, \"we're out of mashed potatoes, would you like french fries?\"  My eyes got so big, as did his, and we were like \"are you for real?\".  Their like \"yes, we ran out (on a friday night no less), so if you want mashed potatoes, we will have to make more for you\".  He said, \"Ummm...if I'm ordering a $50 plate of steak and potatoes, I don't wanna eat french fries\".  Seriously.  I was floored.  They were kinda rude about  him wanting mashed potatoes, too.  And, as you can imagine, it took a very long time to get our food.  The atmosphere in this place is cool, and our server was pretty efficient for the most part.  The birthday girl enjoyed her food (i think), but I wish we coulda just went to Thai Cuisine.  The steak looked greasy so I figured pasta"}
{"text":"Meat & Potatoes delivers a consistent level of good and service quality. While the menu is ... the name suggests ... pretty predicable fare, the preparation and presentation are well done.   We enjoyed a few small plates including the best mussels we've enjoyed outside of France. My wife also had the soft shell crab ... regrettably seasonal but she savored every bite.   Service was attentive and pleasant."}
{"text":"I want to love this place and recommend it to everyone I know, but I cant.  The food is good, great flavors, unique items with a large variety. It really is all about the meat and starches here, and they do it well.  But, if you have a sweet tooth, the desserts aren't go satisfy you.  Its okay though, you'll probably be too full from the snacks, appetizers, and main course.   Now for the bad, I've been their twice and service was terrible, to the point that I'm not sure I'm going to go back.  First visit, out dinner took almost 3 hours.  The waiter was forgetting things left and right and when it came time to pay the bill, we spent 20 minutes waiting .  Our waiter was engaged in conversation with a guy at the bar, and that guy had to point out that our WHOLE table was staring at them, before he came back to grab our cards.  Second visit:  They are particular about getting the temperature of your protein right, they even ask how you would like your salmon cooked (which I think is kind of bizarre).  Given that, I ordered my pork medium.  I got a piece that I had to saw into, definitely not medium.  They right away offered to take it back and fire a new dish for me.  Great I thought.  A long time passes, I see a couple pork dishes come out of the kitchen, none of them  mine.  One of my friends is getting irritated for me that its taking so long.  The rest of my party is piratically done eating their dinner, i'm basically full from eating everyone's french fries, and FINALLY my pork comes out.  Obviously I'm not going to eat this whole meal by my self while the rest of my table, full from their meals and ready to go, is watching me. Sigh...so I pack it up.  The second piece was cooked right, but I'm upset that it so long, I didn't even get to enjoy.  =("}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Poor service and unimpressive foods. First, poor service.  There was a waitress who kept hitting my father's chair in order to serve some foods to our next table. Because of her, he had to move his chair to the other side but she'd never apologized until we asked to do.  Their service was also very slow.  Second, unimpressive foods.  We had stakes and Bo Ssam there. Stakes were not bad. However, Bo Ssam was awful.  Bo Ssam is a Korean traditional dish. Since I am a native Korean, I'm really well aware of how the dish should be. It is NOT the Bo Ssam at all. It is not even close to the original dish and there is nothing close to the original dish. So disappointed.  Actually, I tried to find anything positive about this restaurant and the only positive thing is the location. That's all.   Will never go this restaurant again!!"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal, or a bad time here.  Cuban sandwich is great.  They usually only have one vegetarian entree on the menu for dinner, but it has always been delicious.    Toast + Jam + goat butter is delicious  Sweet potato fries are delicious  Everything is delicious."}
{"text":"My husband and I dined at this establishment after having dinner the previous evening at Butcher and the Rye.  Initially we stopped in for drinks planning on hitting up another spot for dinner.  We were hooked by the drinks and the fabulous food we saw come out of the kitchen.  We had root to berry, old fashioned, and multiple other beverages.  All were artfully crafted and tasted wonderful.  We dined on tuna ceviche, beef tartar, the pork chop and mushroom flatbread.  I don't think you could go wrong with anything on this menu.  Everything was excellent!  We would go back in a heartbeat if we didn't live 6 hours away."}
{"text":"I have only visited Meat & Potatoes once, and for the most part it was a great experience. The food is inspired. I ate eggs in purgatory, and my date had chicken and waffles. I was delighted by my dish which truly brought me to heaven. I was jealous of my date's meal, though it more appropriately should be called \"A Chicken with and waffles.\" Seriously though, it was more food than either of us could handle, and made a lovely chicken salad throughout the rest of the week.  It is indisputable that the food and cocktails hit the spot. However the atmosphere makes the speak-easy vibe fall short. The high ceilings, metal riveted ceilings reminiscent of Walmart, and overly packed space ultimately disservice the intimacy created by the seating and mirrors that I am guessing the establishment is striving for.  Despite the ever so slight problems with the architecture, this spot is not one to miss. Located within the cultural district, this a happening, distinguished yet casual restaurant where you nearly feel transported to another time with food that is out of this world!"}
{"text":"Every time I have been to this restaurant it has been very busy.  They have a really weird reservation system too!   So the first time I visited was after the theater, we did not eat just had a cocktail and I mean one as the bartender that evening was too busy with some guys and the absinthe machine to ever get back to us for a second drink.  But we still vowed to return to eat.  So the second time we go for Sunday brunch, it is very busy, there were 3 of us but we managed to find 2 seats at the bar. We wanted to eat at the bar but they make you put your name on the list as it is reservations there too.  Unfortunately they have super vapid hostesses who seem to have no facial recognition or clue as to what they are doing.  So while sitting there we are seeing some food coming out and the Chicken and Waffles looks delicious.  The bartender Cecil was pretty fantastic. But then a server comes to inform the bartenders that  they are out of the chicken.  So after sitting awhile (the place had pretty much cleared out by then) the hostess finally comes over to move us to the other side of the bar .We thought this to be very odd!  Which was still dirty from previous customers and then needed to be cleaned, as we stood there and waited.  I ended up with the breakfast Americano which was a typical breakfast but with a house made sausage link and that was very good.  My other friend got short rib hash also very tasty and the other got the grilled cheese,  which he said was the \"best grilled cheese he had ever had\" All in all everyone was happy with that visit.   The third time we try to go again it was for Sunday brunch as we really wanted to try that Chicken.  But it was a no go as my one friend has very little patience and when they told us we couldn't wait at the bar she wanted to leave. So we went somewhere else that day.   The fourth time we had a party of six and had made a reservation and they gave us the private room.  I finally got that Chicken and Waffles along with two of my other friends and I was extremely disappointed as were they!  While the chicken itself was moist and juicy the breading lacked any flavor at all (seriously Shop n Save has better fried chicken) and the waffle was dry too!  Now it comes with a bourbon, bacon syrup which was tasty but the waffle itself broke apart when you touched it with the fork.  And four of the six had the house made sausage patty that day and the four of us that ate it got ill.  I was relating this some other people who said that also got ill after eating here. Mental note:\"No more sausage here\"!  Even after that a couple of months later I with two friends were in town for the Arts Festival and wanted to have a couple drinks and apps so we try to go here and it was extremely busy again and we decided to go elsewhere.  So I think in all of my visits it is either hit or miss the service is generally good with the exception of Cecil the bartender who is very welcoming and friendly.   The hostesses vapid (every time I have been there).  The food good some days and not so great others.  But I would still like to try dinner perhaps one day when there is a blizzard!"}
{"text":"Everything we ate was so good.  We shared the Brussel sprouts and the mussels to start and they were both addictive.  My duck was out of this world and I don't even know what the many sides were that it came with, but they were so good too!  The waiter and service was fine.....we asked to be given time and we were.  Not rushed and the waiter did help with menu selection.  They could increase their tequila selection, but their bourbon, whiskey choices were extensive.  The asian salmon had excellent rice and perfect, full flavor.  We all walked out of there raving.    BTW, made the reservations months in advance."}
{"text":"Really good brunch food - lots of fruit flies - including ones dying in two of our coffee cups (coffee was good besides that though :-) - had French toast which was really good but at 10 it should be. Steak and eggs was also very good but at 22 it should be as well. Management should've removed both coffees from bill but tried to attribute them to open doors in the back... Which is not how fruit flies appear..."}
{"text":"If it was legal to marry a brunch menu in the state of Pennsylvania, I would propose to Meat & Potatoes. Instead, I will continue to live in sin with the short rib hash."}
{"text":"Chef Dom is the GOAT. Hands down one of the best places to enjoy a meal downtown. Can't go wrong. Great drink specials too. An absolute must stop if you're downtown visiting Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"We went for graduation dinner on Saturday night. They had our table ready, prompt service, good food everything was perfect.! We had 45oz ribeye steak and bone marrow, especially loved duck pate highly recommend. The open bar was great too, made our daughter non alcoholic beverage with a twist. It was our son's favorite place to dine good hearty food, he'll miss this place~"}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for a good spot to show visiting family the good eats of Pittsburgh and decided on meat and potatoes. What can I say? The bone marrow was delicious as always! The toppings that you can add to it are a nice touch but not necessary.  The bread that it comes with is the perfect vessel for the perfect marrow. I want to go back every week just for that! My father loved the  Mac and cheese and while I'm not a huge drinker, there is an interesting cocktail list. My wife had an old fashioned and said it was fine but nothing great. Nice place to bring out of towners looking for a good meal in the city. But make a reservation!"}
{"text":"Meat & Potatoes has a great atmosphere and I've never been disappointed by the food.  The menu has some unique options, and all of the meals I've ordered have been delicious. Twice I ordered the bone marrow, and each time it was good, but it never comes with enough toast to spread it on!  This is also a great spot to get a quick bite and drink before a show (just let them know you are going to a show and they will accommodate your schedule).  The service at the bar is always top-notch and the drinks are wonderful.  It is a little pricey, but mostly worth it."}
{"text":"One of my favorite BBQ restaurants in town! Come back each time to have the wings (dry rub) and pulled pork. Great vibe feels like I'm having a BBQ in my backyard. Friendly staff with great recommendations."}
{"text":"This is such a cool place you definitely need to try if you're in Pittsburgh! We had originally seen guy from diners, drive ins, and dives there so we knew we had to go! We walked in first thing on a Sunday morning, they weren't even open yet, but they were packed!! She asked if he has reservations and our hearts dropped as we thought we were going to have to find another place to eat. But the host very gladly accommodated us with a reservation about an hour and a half later. So we walked around, grabbed some star bucks which is right across the street, and we're back a little early and they sat us immediately. Their menu is so unique and fun. You can tell they take great pride in their food, it was amazing!! Their Bloody Mary bar was so fun! You got to choose your flavor infused vodka (I had the garlic something and my friend had the bacon) then everything else is up to you! They have literally every option available when it comes to a Bloody Mary! I cannot wait to return to this place!!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and good food.  We had the 45oz steak, slightly fatty but cooked perfectly.  Need slightly larger tables, our steak barely fit with our drinks and the candle.  Definitely make reservations, especially on weekends."}
{"text":"Over priced, trendy. Glad to see Pittsburgh has turned into such a foodie town, this isn't my favorite. If you like a lot of pork belly or pickled food, you will love it here. The fried Brussels sprouts are delicious, make a reservation, good for a small dinner meeting."}
{"text":"I have only eaten there twice once for dinner and once for breakfast. It was amazing. I tell people to try it all the time."}
{"text":"Food was outstanding! The pork chop which is smoked was ridiculously juicy and flavorful. Curry mussels were delicious, I could have licked the bowl clean. Tres leches cakes was perfect. Cocktails were just ok, a bit overpriced for how much they give you. Service was great. Will go back for sure, but will stick with wine."}
{"text":"Unique twist on steakhouse fare. A nice atmosphere before going to a show. A bit crowded, but, that goes with the territory..."}
{"text":"I'm disappointed in the service and the kitchen at Meat & Potatoes.   First, I usually expect my server to know what the daily specials are, but our server read the brunch menu off of a handwritten list that she was carrying around. When it was time for dessert, she again read from her list. It appeared that she either missed one of the desserts or the kitchen had run out (we saw the table next to us order a dessert that wasn't offered to us).  Second, I was unhappy with the wait time. We waited quite a while for a table, though this was probably largely our fault for not reserving a table for Sunday brunch. But then on top of that, we waited far too long for our food after we ordered. We waited at least half an hour for our food to come in this crowded, noisy restaurant. Our server never stopped by our table to tell us what was going on with our order but let us sit and talk amongst ourselves about how long we were waiting for our meal. I'm not sure what was going on in the kitchen, but we waited over half an hour for our food. The restaurant was busy, but surely not any busier than any other Sunday brunch period. We ordered straight off the menu, so there was no excuse for the delay.   I ordered the grilled cheese and tomato soup, which was fairly good. There wasn't too much cheese on my sandwich, which I took to be intentional. In fact, I was talking about how some restaurants put too much cheese on their sandwiches, thus crowding out out the deliciousness of the fresh bread! Then my chef husband pointed out where the cheese had run off the sandwich and melted onto the grill while being overcooked. The cheese had been cooked right out of my sandwich.  My husband ordered the brisket flat bread and was disappointed. He thought it tasted charred (\"dirty oven taste\") and underseasoned. Our other dining companion ordered the short rib hash. She said it was delicious, but she couldn't eat the bottom layer of potatoes in the dish because they were sitting in a puddle of grease.   There were a few other things on the menu that I was thinking I'd try next time, but after today's experience, I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"We had theater tickets yesterday afternoon at CLO Cabaret. We thought we'd enjoy a nice brunch at Meat & Potatoes before the show. We've been there before and the food has been excellent.  As soon as we entered, we knew we couldn't stay. This place has decided to have a DJ on Sunday mornings. The music was so loud, with such heavy bass, that there was no way we would be able to carry on a conversation with our friends, much less enjoy a relaxing meal. The hostess offered to have the music turned down. After doing so, it wasn't any better.  So we left and had a lousy \"meal\" of bar food in the theater.  Why do places think it's a good idea to turn into a night club on an early Sunday afternoon?   We won't be back. Too bad, it used to be a nice place."}
{"text":"I have been to restaurants all over the country for over twenty years and let me tell you that this restaurant is now one of my top five experiences. Not only was the food amazing, but even more impressive than that was the service. While most people were dressed a little more than casual, I walked in with my family in nice jeans and a hoodie (Thanks Yelp). We didn't even get a second glance and were treated like any other customer. Everyone from the host to the waiter was so friendly and wanted to make sure we had an excellent experience.  On to the food.... wow! Spectacular! To start, we got an order of the fried brussels, fries, devils on horseback, and mac & cheese. Everything was fantastic. The devils on horseback is a dish completely unique to this establishment (I've never had it anywhere else or even heard of it) and the mac & cheese was so rich and hearty. The chorizo and pulled pork are perfectly balanced in it to ensure that you get tons of flavor without it being too heavy of a dish. You have to order these two things if you go here.  For our main courses, my wife got the Pork Chop and I got one of the specials (Black Bass with Squash Soup). Be prepared  to eat if you get the pork chop because it's as big as your head. The pork chop comes with a couple of slices of brisket on top to accentuate the dish and was delicious. The black bass comes with a cranberry relish and a small dish of the squash soup, which you are apparently supposed to pour around your bass to get a perfect combination of flavors. That is exactly what it was, a perfect combination of flavors. The soup itself was great and the taste of all those elements combined was superb.  We got the chocolate pot de creme for desert, which was like a chocolate mousse. Like the rest of the meal, it did not disappoint. Rich without being overbearing .  If you are only in Pittsburgh for a day and are looking for one hell of a dining experience, you HAVE to go here. For people with younger children, they have high chairs so go enjoy yourselves."}
{"text":"Lived up to its reviews. We split the 45 ounce rib eye, and it was heavenly--melts in your mouth like butter. Recommend the roasted cauliflower too. Creamed spinach a little too nutmeggy, but otherwise fine. Surprised at how easy it was to carry on a conversation given the high ceilings and background music. Waiters seemed a little too busy--ie, overworked--but service was fine. Bonus points for being so close to the stadium that we could walk to the Pirates game after dinner."}
{"text":"Made a reservation on this place, as last time it was a zoo without one! I would recommend a reservation before coming here, it's always busy. We came for Saturday brunch and had the Bloody Mary bar. Their Bloody Mary bar had a large selection of charcuterie, dolmas, cheeses and vodkas - even bacon and mini meat sticks. I got the steak frites. It was cooked perfectly, and the fries were really good! Not going to lie, my boyfriend got the chicken and waffles and those were even more tasty - everything you would want on a brunch! They gave him 4 huge pieces of chicken! The mimosas were good too. I would definitely come here again. 4 stars because even though the food was good and the service was great, it's not the best brunch I've ever had. This will definitely become a staple every time I visit Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I loved this experience at Meat & Potatoes! The only disappointment was I had my mind (and stomach! Lol) set on the lamb burger which is posted on the menu online but it's no longer being served. Huge letdown! But I enjoyed the mushroom flatbread, fried taters w/ truffle mayo...although the fries had way too much salt...and fried pickles. The grilled bread with goat cheese and jam were my favorite part of the meal."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner last December right when they opened at 5pm and had to wait an hour for a table, so definitely make a reservation. Luckily, there's a Starbucks down the street to wait at when it's cold and rainy outside, haha! I got the salmon with black rice and it was delicious. There's a lot of interesting things on the menu and a nice selection of drinks. It is crowded and very loud, but the food is worth it. Can't wait to go back the next time I'm in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"BEST lunch I've ever had. Seriously. I'm not even talking about dinner!  Thick cut juicy pastrami belly sandwich with truffle fries and perfectly poached eggs on the Irish Benedict. I think my gf was there with me but I'm not sure..I was too focused on the food.  Oh yea, just in case you want to impress your significant other, reserve tickets for the Theater Square right next door! They perform musicals from the Pittsburgh CLO company and it's a perfect place for a dinner/lunch date after you get your Meat and Potatoes on.   Parking is street or in a garage off 7th. On the weekends it's $9 all day."}
{"text":"Comfort food heaven! The restaurant is beautifully decorated with a modern flair. I was there for a client lunch and plenty of comfortable seating for five.   Fried pickles - Delish! And I hate pickles.  Mac n' Cheese - Creamy goodness  Turkey Club - HUGE, opportunity to split with someone  Items are reasonably priced and worth it!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service!  Great for kids as well.  A different restaurant with creative combinations.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Went for brunch. This place is just on another level. It was outstanding. Must do if you are in the city."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent! I have been here a couple times and have not been disappointed. I have never tried bone marrow before and it didn't sound like it would be anything good, but it was. It's a little hard to eat since it is on a bone, other than that very good."}
{"text":"I was here to visit a friend for the day. Couldn't have been happier with the meal. Some of the best food I've had in a restaurant."}
{"text":"Meat and Potatoes (M&P) is the somewhat new gastropub from Nine on Nine Chef/Owner Richard Deshantz.  I have only been there twice but I have a strong feeling that it will be a fixture in the Cultural District for a long time.  It is a prohibition-era themed restaurant that is heavy on marble and velvet.  One fun aspect of M&P is their tableware: it is not uncommon for food to be served on cutting boards, or in mason jars with ceramic lids.    During our first trip over the summer, my girlfriend and I split the ahi tuna appetizer ($13); I got the Ribeye ($42) and she got the softshell crab tacos ($13).  The appetizer was raw chunks of tuna with wasabi infused tobiko on top.  It was served with some sort of rice chips on the side that were there to provide some texture to contrast the tuna.  It is an interesting take on a tuna appetizer and is still one of my favorite dishes.    Our dinner took a while to arrive but that is to be expected when ordering a 26 oz. steak.  My girlfriend enjoyed her softshell crab tacos and at only $13 it was quite a deal for 3 large tacos with an entire crab in each.  The crabs did not look like any softshell crab I have had in spider rolls or on sandwiches.  It was more high quality than what I am used to, but then again it should be considering the restaurant and price.    I was hesitant about the ribeye being $42 but with some goading from our excellent server I could not resist.  It is served on a wooden cutting board with a massive steak knife. It comes with confit steak fries, housemade steak sauce, and bone marrow butter served directly on the bone.  The fries were good and the steak sauce was fantastic.  I normally disagree with ruining the integrity of a steak by dipping it in a sauce, but this wasn't your typical A1.  The sauce, paired with the marrow butter, took an already great steak to another level.  They had four beers on draught during this trip but I enjoyed my dinner with a can of Wittkerke ($5) and a Belhaven Scottish Ale ($7).    On our last trip we went in for dessert and drinks.  We got the chocolate bread pudding and my girlfriend loved it but I wasn't too interested.  I became intrigued by cocktails that require egg whites, or meringue, and my attention could not stray from them.  My first one was the Old Canadian ($8), it consists of Old Grandad Bourbon, meringue, vanilla, maple, bitters, orange, and lemon.  It is served in a small rounded cocktail glass with a dehydrated orange slice that is supported by the thick meringue.  This was my first experience with meringue in a cocktail but it will surely not be my last.  The airiness and sweet texture of the meringue added an entirely new dimension to cocktails.  I normally find cocktails to be one note, either all alcohol and no mixer, or no alcohol and all mixer.  The meringue on top provided a sweetness that mellowed out the strong flavor of bourbon.  I also had the Tequila Fizz and although vastly different in styles of alcohol, it was similar in how effectively the flavors contrasted each other.    It is an expensive place, but it is worth every penny.  Keep M&P in mind for your next birthday or special occasion.  My only qualm is the clientele.  The location and food served doesn't allow for a typical, blue collar Pittsburgher to be comfortable.  I don't believe it is the restaurant's fault, as they are more than accommodating.  The Downtown suits just don't seem to like sitting beside someone wearing a flannel (me).  Ultimately, it is about the food and the food is superb.  That, paired with the service, make this one of my absolute favorite restaurants.     Oh yeah, you can add foie gras to anything..."}
{"text":"It was my husband and I first time and the whole experience was awesome. We didn't have a reservation, so we at at the bar! LOVED the POT ROAST and the bring you A- Game if you think you can handle the PORK CHOP!!! Great Food, Great Atmosphere!!!"}
{"text":"This place is well deserving of the hype. I had the mushroom flatbread, which was orgasmic. I shared the ribeye for 2 with the creamed spinach and rosemary potatoes. Steak was cooked perfectly and the sides were amazing. The vibe of the room is what you want. Service is great and a fun atmosphere. Need to come back soon . If you are thinking about going DO IT!"}
{"text":"In the past month I've had dinner twice there and the food was more impressive each time. The duck breast is amazing. Then I had the pork chop. OMG is was a double bone chop, like having your own personal mini ham. And the sides, Jesus if I lived here I'd be the size of the blimp. O and throw in poutine for an app, the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"The sloppy Joe sandwich was overwhelmingly sauce with little meat flavor. The fish tacos were good. The burger with caramelized onions was cooked perfectly and was excellent. The duck salad was light on the duck and heavy on the salad. The fried pickles were mundane. The chocolate popcorn mousse was light on chocolate was interesting but not to be repeated. Service was good. Prices were high. Atmosphere was fine."}
{"text":"Best pork chop in the city. Cocktails are also top notch but if often takes forever to get you drink. Staff is attentive.  If you want to go on a Friday or Saturday make sure you make reservations 3 weeks in advance."}
{"text":"I finally tried Meat & Potatoes all in all very good food , I had the fried pickles with there spicy ranch ,I found it very interesting .The main course was 34 oz Ribeye for 2 it was a very good choice  with all the sides that come with it .A very nice restaurant but not making a reservation we waited about a hour for a table ,had a few drinks and noticed about 7 tables vacant ? So al in all I enjoyed the meal but I suggest reservations."}
{"text":"We tried this place after being featured in the travel channel as one of the best ribeye steaks in the country. We were not disappointed. Steak was grilled perfectly. Bone marrow was also very good. Alot of interesting things in the menu. Will be back to try them soon..."}
{"text":"Loved this place! The waiters were very friendly, the atmosphere is great for a date night and the food was great! We got the steak and potato dinner for two and the fried pickles. The place is in a good location but it is pretty small so be sure to make a reservation before the day of your visit."}
{"text":"I'd give M&P a 3.5 if I could, but I'll round up.  The atmosphere here is great, and we've always had good service. Don't expect to get a table / bar seat most nights (or even a last minute reservation) unless you're lucky, so a visit here can require planning.   From a food perspective, we've had mixed experiences. On a brunch visit with a large group, most were satisfied, but my grandpa's fried chicken was burned (the exterior even looked overly browned) and my huevos rancheros weren't very flavorful. We've been here many times for dinner and have had a large chunk of the menu, and again had some hits and misses: fried pickles, duck pate, short rib flatbread, mac 'n cheese, and all chocolate desserts (that dirt pudding!) were great, while the fried chicken livers (cut way too large and the breading fell off) and duck breast (not very flavorful, overcooked) just didn't do it for us. Beer and cocktail list is just de rigeur."}
{"text":"After visiting Meat and Potatoes 2 times now I can honestly say I'm not impressed and to be honest a little disappointed.  The first time I had reservations and we still were asked to wait 30 minutes for our table to be prepared. When we sat down there were at least 5-6 open tables. The restaurant is pretty small. The meal was good though. I had a Manhattan and the Waygu flat iron steak and my friend had the duck. Both were delicious.  On my second visit we again had to wait for quite some time even with having reservations and the teeny bopper that was our hostess had an attitude. We were seated and waited for an extremely long time. They were out of many things including the fried pickles and so we ordered the Devils on horseback. They were alright. We waited even longer for our food and my flat iron steak fell flat this time. It was cold as was the pasta that our friend ordered. I was extremely disappointed and have to say for the long wait and poor service I would expect decent food. For the price and other reasons combined I don't think Meat and Potatoes will be on my list of places to frequent. There are a lot of better and more reliable options in Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Definitely make a reservation and preferably early to avoid dishes being sold out. I was looking forward to the meat and potatoes for 2 but it was sold out by the time we sat down. Still, the pot roast and hanger steak were amazing. Would definitely recommend if you're not on a budget."}
{"text":"Meat & Potatoes is one of the best, most original restaurants in Pittsburgh. I love how they don't shy away from using offal but they elevate it into the sublime.  Was there on a weeknight (shocking that I got reservations the same day) and had the pig's ears salad and some wagyu flank steak. As usual everything was delicious! The only (minor) complaint was the high salt content of the mashed potatoes.  This place embodies the growing \"sophisticated\" food movement in Pittsburgh, but in an unpretitious manner. Hope that never changes!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice now, once with my mother who was visiting and the other was with a group of people. This review is based on the second time we went. My boyfriend and I had both called asking about a reservation for a party of 20 and were told to e-mail someone, we both did and received no e-mail back. We called again numerous times before someone finally got back to us less than a week until the party. She was very nice and explained it would be $250 to rent out the back room (not too bad) and a $500 minimum food and drink order, which between a group wasn't hard to hit. But, I had a couple questions about the menu and checks and was never responded back to. When we arrived they had the back room ready except for the appetizers that we had asked to have out when we arrived. Our waiter was really great and he had extra staff helping him which was nice. The food and drinks were all delicious, I had the steak and it was awesome! One downfall is that the room was in the back behind the kitchen so it's very private so we felt a little left out of the cool atmosphere but it's great if privacy is what you want with a big party.   My only one complaint was they knew it was for my birthday and they didn't mention it or even bring out a small desert which I thought was a little rude since we had paid $250 just for the room and our total bill just between my boyfriend and I was over $500. Also, the manager never came into check on us or see if everything was going well. (I've planned big parties like this before and usually they stop in to make sure you're happy with everything). All things considered we will be back for sure but definitely plan a group event somewhere else with a bit more of a lively area."}
{"text":"When we arrived at the restaurant, the music was booming. We actually went outside; yes, it was that loud. Also, the steak was HUGE and it was undercooked, and then, after we sent it back, it was over cooked. Is Meat and Potatoes just a place for drinks and dessert? Will it soon fall down? Yelp readers, unite!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch on a saturday in october.  Great vibe, good music, great mixed drinks, and very filling and clever takes on breakfast/brunch items.  Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I came here as my going-away dinner in Pgh. I picked the place just becuase of its name (well from a shortlist of restaurants that got picked because of their menu).   Libations:  I had the El Segundo, which is sweet but you can smell the jalapeno floating on the drink with each sip. Truly delicious! I also stole a sip from my friend's Up in Smoke which was equally good, despite having whiskey which I am not a fan of. I decided to be good and stick to just one drink since I had to drive home.   Snacks: We had the ahi tuna, fried chicken livers, devils on horseback and poutine. My fave was the ahi tuna, but I just love raw fish! Everything was truly deletable, the poutine was an experience.   Dinner: I got the braised lamb shank and that night instead of the polenta, they were serving beans and greens with bacon. Mmm, who doesn't like bacon? the lamb shank was oh-so-good! the portion sizes here are huge, I stuffed my face and had enough leftovers to stuff my face again for lunch.  Service/Atmosphere: Service was good, nothing to complain. The place is busy, which I love. Love the energy there!  We couldn't have done dessert even if we wanted to. I almost had to be rolled down the street to home. Happily rolled."}
{"text":"Walked into an empty restaurant on a Sunday at 4 pm and were told they were booked solid. The outdoor seating area with 10 or so tables was completely empty, but without reservations, we'd have to wait at the bar for an hour and a half. I thought that the idea of this place was a gastropub, i.e. a public house. Instead they came across as condescending, pretentious pricks. Way too many other high quality restaurants in Pittsburgh I'll be voting for with my dollars."}
{"text":"I'm not going to rehash what's been stated hear a billion times, this place is solid.  But due try to get a Sunday brunch reservation about a month in advance, the brunch menu is unique and unbelievable.  Skip the bloody mary bar and just get something off of the menu."}
{"text":"Have been many times. Food is always consistantly good. Always busy. However service always seems to be lacking. Hostess cold when you come in. Bartenders always seem to be catering to the regulars. Would come more often if the service was more consistant."}
{"text":"I took my husband here for father's day.  The service was wonderful, food was great. Kinda loud (actually had live music) the music was good just little loud for me."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Even though they are known for their giant steak to share; the entrees and snacks I had weren't grossly over proportioned. I left 100% satisfied."}
{"text":"Meat and Potatoes is a gastropub that is conveniently located next to the O'Reilly Theater in the Cultural District in Downtown Pittsburgh. There is a lunch and dinner menu during the week and a brunch and dinner menu during the weekends. We attended during Saturday Brunch before a performance at the theater. We made a reservation in which I highly recommend. Those that did not opted to leave due to the wait time and patrons with later reservations did not find luck getting a seat earlier. I didn't have much wait time at all as my table was provided shortly after arrival. The seating is very close and crowded. There is not much privacy or room to move whatsoever. But lets focus on why we go to restaurants, food and service. Our waiter was very patient, pleasant and did a great job refilling our water. The food was plentiful. The servings were much larger than I expected. We ordered the fried tators with truffle mayo and potato gratin as appetizers. The fried tators were seasoned tremendously. May be a bit salty for some, but they were great to us. I elected to get the chicken and cheddar and jalapeno waffle. There were four large pieces of chicken which included a leg, thigh, wing, and breast. I was full the entire day off of this entree. The bourbon bacon syrup offered a tasty contrast to the heat of the waffle. My date had the french toast which was equally large and delicious. If you want to be full, enjoy a flavorful meal, don't mind crowds or tight seating, the brunch at Meat and Potatoes is highly recommended."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot.  I think reservations are a good idea when heading here in the evening, probably mandatory if you're going on a weekend.  Good food, good service, wheelchair accessible including the bathrooms, although the dining room is more than a little tight!  I definitely recommend reservations if you're in a chair like my husband, although we have had good success just showing up, even if it is a little uncomfortable for the people that need to squeeze by his chair."}
{"text":"great food  one of the best in PGH"}
{"text":"The drinks here are outstanding and the atmosphere is great.  We tried the duck and the pot roast and both were outstanding.  Definitely a great place for dinner or a drink."}
{"text":"We went here on a whim on Saturday at 10:45, and we were told needed a reservation--that's how busy this place gets!  We decided to sit at the bar so we could eat immediately!  Hubby and I started out with the Bloody Mary Bar, which had every imaginable topping under the sun, you could truly make a meal of that!  I had the dill infused vodka, he had the black pepper garlic--both were awesome!!    Hubby ordered the burger, he said it was delicious, but amazingly messy, with the egg and cheese atop of it, and ended up eating it with a fork and knife!!  Our daughter had the grilled cheese and tomato soup...huge and delish!!  I had the  mushroom bruschetta, humongous portion--I could barely eat one, but it was so yummy I couldn't stop!   Since we were sitting at the bar, we had the opportunity to interact and hear the bartenders talk about the spirits and food.  All three were absolutely professional, knowledgeable, and friendly. Atmosphere is hip and trendy, food and drinks are very reasonably priced-- we will be back for dinner!"}
{"text":"Before going to the Benedum, which is literally and conveniently across the street from Meat and Potatoes,  my friend and I decided to have dinner there outdoors.  The service was excellent - in particular the gentleman who cleaned the tables was both pleasant while dutiful.  I had the roast beef which was excellent; my friend ordered the mac and cheese appetizer (too rich and quite unlike mac and cheese in a bad way) and the mushroom risotto (excellent); though we both knew that the restaurant is famous for its \"meat and potatoes\", we were hoping to have ice cream for dessert - or at least more than a meager choice of 3 options.  I settled on the chocolate mousse which was small, but delicious - nice and rich - I wish there had been more; my friend had a strawberry layered cheesecake dessert which she found delicious as well - just wanted more!... All and all, I recommend M &P - good food; nice quantity (except desserts); great service; great ambiance - would definitely make reservations a few day before hand if you can."}
{"text":"Staff is helpful. Many creative menu items. Love it."}
{"text":"They have gotten their act together a bit better on the timing issue.  Food is coming out faster.  I actually think this is my new favorite place.  I can't even begin to tell you how much I love the fried brussel sprouts.  And the mushroom flatbread....heavenly.  The saffron and beer mussels...wonderful.  My friend had the pork chop....he said it was the best one he's ever had...he cleaned that puppy down to the bone.  The Gin Richard drink....amazing.  Yes....just goes to show, you need to give places a second try before you write it off.  This is now my fav place in the 'Burgh."}
{"text":"On a whim we decide to walk in to this highly recommended restaurant in the theater district of downtown pittsburgh later on a saturday night with no reservations and surprisingly did not wait long to get a table.  It truly lives up to its name because the meat and potatoes were epic.   The hanger steak was perfectly prepared and absolutely divine laid out on top of delicious fingerling potatoes.  However, the soft shell crab tacos fell short for me.  I love soft shell crab and these really missed the mark.  They weren't in any way complimented or highlighted in their presentation.  Our appetizer, the devils on horseback or dates wrapped in bacon with sirhachi, were delicious and the bacon made desire...well, more bacon.  It was so good.    A+ to the staff and the ambiance but not a huge fan of the up close and personal seating arrangements.  I find that most modern and trendy spots seem to want you on top of the couple next to you and everyone walking behind you.  I also was a bit put off by our server bringing a can of beer and a glass to the table and pouring it table side.  Maybe it's just me but I don't want the illusion there's a bunch of igloo camp coolers in the kitchen labeled with beer types they're fishing our libations out of.    All in all, it's not always about the food and with good company any meal can be a positive experience.  I would return again soon as the menu offers a wide array of choices I just couldn't get to that night.  Great place."}
{"text":"Cocktails are amazing, the food was uneven and less inspired than I had hoped for.  If you're going to go here you might as well get the rib eye for the main course, you can't go wrong with rib eye and the rest of the entree menu ended up being pretty lackluster."}
{"text":"Really a strong 4.5. Knocking off .5-1 star for the use of canola oil when they have so much rendered animal fat laying around. Not just healthier, just plain tastes better.   Beyond that - WOW. Just go.   Ordered:  Bone Marrow Mac n Cheese Lamb Burger Duck Breast Korean Rueben Salmon  All amazing. All cooked to the proper and requested level of doneness/temp.   Service was awesome and paced well in terms of how the dishes came out.   Atmosphere - even with a full-house - was relaxing and quiet enough you didn't need to shout in order to have a conversation.   After going to both here and Cure - it's no contest.....M&P HANDS DOWN!   I think I may have found my new favorite. Go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"The food was great, but the service was iffy. I ordered the chicken and waffles, and it was delicious, but very filling, as are many of the dishes. The service was very slow, however."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that I can never remember to make a reservation for before a show . If you been following my day at all you will notice I been eating my way through Pittsburgh today . I'm going all in then I'm in serious diet mode. So my city crew decided to dine here for restaurant week 3 courses for 35 bucks. Since I had a late lunch I only ordered drinks and appetizers. To get me in the mood for Puerto Rico I ordered Malibu rum which they didn't have so she made me some pomegranate something or the other... I seen chicken livers on the menu and got excited can't remember the last time I had them. As pictured they came out fried to perfection and so tender yuuummmmers. My next appetizer I chose was the pate which was definitely more on the sweet side for some reason rather than savory. My girlfriends loved there food however I couldn't tell you what it was. Our waitress Jessica was the bomb. I would definitely comeback"}
{"text":"Wait, have I never reviewed M&P? Basically my favorite resto in the great city of Pittsburgh?!?!  I LOVE this spot. I always have good experiences and you can't beat the cocktails and Monday night specials!  M&P is wonderful for everything. I love their prohibition-style craft cocktails (especially the blood and sand) and everything on the menu is superb, especially the brunch menu. Faves include the Croque-Madame, chicken and waffles, poutine ...  My favorite time to go though is on Monday nights, for the late-night menu from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m. It's constantly rotating and is a great way to get a good M&P meal on the cheap."}
{"text":"I was again impressed by the service here! I took my family here after my graduation and we were seated in semi private area that had the appearance of a farm kitchen with a modern twist.  The restaurant handled our group of 7 with ease and everyone was extremely satisfied. My foodie brother from Boston was especially impressed. I knew there was a reason I loved this place."}
{"text":"Service is very spotty and the food takes long to come out. However it still tastes delicious and I like their vibe"}
{"text":"Delicious food; great atmosphere and excellent (bonus) whiskey selection. Gem in downtown Pitt. Don't miss if traveling."}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to eat at meat & potatoes for the second time last night, and as the story goes, it was the best of times, it was the worst of times.  I must admit it did not live up to its 'reputation'. For our first soirée, there we had brunch, and it turned out GREAT! My wife had the short rib hash (poached egg, horseradish hollandaise) @ around $12-14 it was priced right and tasted good. I had chicken and waffles (not as good as chi-town HOWEVER for PGH it was phabulous) and it was both filling and tasted good. SOO good that I made a mental note and put this place on my must try again list.   I thought this was the type of establishment that a blue collar working man/woman, needed and would be proud to say... 'I've eaten there'. Again on that first night. Meat & Potatoes hit all the right spots. Service food ambience you name it they hit every note. These were the best of times!!!  Now we come to the worst of times. My wife/soul mate is my foodie buddy. If I am belly to the bar 90+% of the time she is with me. Monday night was no exception. We decided to end her birthday week celebration with another run at nirvana. We shot for the moon and ended up in the trees:(.  My wife ordered the $14.00 pub burger extra well done. The waitstaff brought it to the table with panache, and the bar was set high. When she cut the burger it was as far from well done as you could be. The burger was red and spewed blood necessitating its return to the kitchen. Upon its return the meat was still a shade of pink that prompted my wife to throw in the towel and admit defeat. What was suppose to be a beautiful evening with dinner and dancing turned into... Just sparing with an almost live cow. Will I eat there again sure. Will it be soon. I don't think so. I am going to give my wife's wounds some time to heal."}
{"text":"Great line up of bourbons & scotches. Flat bread (i.e. pizza) was fresh and tasty! Mussels were fresh and plentiful and great."}
{"text":"food was good but not enough. Service was aweful. Our waitress was no where to be found. kinda spacy."}
{"text":"I don't know what they could possibly improve. Been there a few times now and find...  - the atmosphere was warm, interesting, stylish (but not too cool for school) - the menu was really interesting (in a great way) - the food was really, really good  - the staff - we sat at the bar - was awesome. They were really nice, attentive without being annoying, and incredibly knowledgeable at what they do - drinks, amazing selection of beer, cocktails, the works."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places in Pittsburgh. Whether it's brunch, lunch or dinner, it never disappoints. Delicious food, great cocktails and a unique atmosphere. Definitely a must try."}
{"text":"Arrived at 5 for a pre- show dinner, we're done and out by 6:30 with plenty of time for the 7 PM show. Dinner was a show unto itself! Our group sampled the Brussels sprouts appetizer- roasted with Parmesan cheese, and the pate, served with toasted bread in a cute little jar..very good with a sweet tang to it. I had the Mussels in a chili broth with sweet potato cubes and roasted chick peas...excellent and plentiful and a nice twist on Moules frites..I had mine with the spectacular Truffle fries with a mayo dip- that alone would suffice for a meal! My husband had the burger with pork belly and an egg...also amazing and huge. The Three little Piggy sandwich that was served could feed a family of four! I would definitely return to sample more of their fare. All was well done and huge portions. Would consider sharing next time."}
{"text":"BRUNCH IS WHERE IT'S AT!  Been there many times and love the brunch.  I only had one bad experience there with a server, but I would never let that discourage me from coming back because the other staff is great!"}
{"text":"It's a great experience as far as the food, ambiance and staff. Been here several times and it's definitely worth stopping by whenever I'm in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"10/10. Would wife. What is there to say, Great cocktails, atmosphere, and food. Brunch is wonderful experience every time. One of those places that feels like you are in a bigger city than pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant!  Great vibe, the food is delicious and the service is top notch!  I return time and time again and am never disappointed."}
{"text":"Visited meat and potatoes after watching Ina Garten speak so I was starving!  Wife and I shared the charcuterie and corn dog for appetizers.  I was surprised by the amount of meat you get in the charcuterie!  Corn dog also tasted pretty good.  For entree we shared the lamb burger which had a really good sauce to it.  Overall the food was good and the environment was hip and fun.  Good for a night of drinks and hanging out.  Reason for not five stars was because although it was good, it didn't completely wow me."}
{"text":"The dining environment was so narrowed and crowded. I could hear every word spoken by the couples next to us.  It's hard to believe this is a highly ranked and recommended restaurant in Pittsburgh since the steak was totally not worth the price (and the 1hr waiting time). There was about 1/3 of the steak was fat. And if you don't order any of the 8-dollar side dishes, all you can get is the beef and the bone marrow. I can't say the steak set was not savory at all but it was just too expensive for that amount of \"edible\" meat, and the variety of the steak set was the least I have ever had. I should believe some of the negative experiences listed in other reviews before I went and I recommend you should too. Although I don't like the food at all, the service was fine so I rated Meat & Potatoes a 2 star."}
{"text":"Amazing drinks, great service, unbelievable food. The Bloody Mary bar is unparalleled but the French 76 is my favorite . Even though the place was busy and we had no reservations, the hostesses and bartender made me feel welcome. Worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple of times, the most recent being last week before a Pirates' game.  Superb gastropub food.  I have had the poutine (great), the fried chicken livers (very good), the bone marrow (outrageously good), and the Pappardelle (really excellent).  The bar tenders are great and make some fabulous drinks.  I would, and will, eat here again the next time I am near there. It is a popular place and seating can get difficult, so reservations are recommended."}
{"text":"If you can get in, this is the most consistently delightful dining experience in Pittsburgh. The specialty cocktails at the bar are extremely interesting and varied. If you're into more traditional cocktails, the best old fashioned I've ever had is from here.   Essentially every piece of food I've had from my few trips here has been delightful. The bone marrow is fun and well made, the goat-butter and jam appetizer is a wonderful combination of flavor, the mac-and-cheese is extremely good, and the spicy stuffed dates were so good I've tried replicating them at home. For entrees, I've had/tried burgers, chicken pot pie, mussels, and a few other dishes I'm forgetting. Not a single one has let me down.   Bottom line is: If you want a meal to remember, get a reservation and try as much on their menu as you can. You will not regret it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in town for a few days and wanted to check out some of the new restaurants in the area. Several people told us to check out this place after I had seen some great reviews online, so we decided to give it a shot. I have to admit I had some pretty high expectations going in due to all the good things I had been hearing and this place hit the nail on the head. I could not have been happier with my meal or with the service. The staff was extremely attentive. The restaurant was crowded when we went (on a Monday night) but I think it added to the excitement and the style. The menu is very different from what you can find anywhere else, they have unique combinations and a very good variety. For example, my boyfriends dish came with Kimchi fried rice and the star of my meal Wagu beef cooked perfectly. I would recommend to anyone and if you're visiting from out of town this is a MUST!!"}
{"text":"BRUNCH: This place was fantastic!!!! They take reservations but leave space for walk-ins. We saw them turn a party of 7 away, without advance reservations large-ish parties can't be accommodated {hostess words not mine}. Our food was fantastic and I chose a wild card, fried chicken, cheddar jalapeño waffles with bacon bourbon syrup, love love love!!!!"}
{"text":"Bar is 5 stars.  Food rates a 4 star.  Excellent drinks and the bartenders are really creative when you ask them to make something different.  It is also fun to watch them work.  The food is not bad by any means, just pricey for what you get.  I have been there several times and plan to return again.  Will try their Brunch next time,"}
{"text":"The place was lively, pretty loud and mostly full as was the bar where I found a seat. Save for the obnoxious shrieking liberal Elvira-mistress-of-the-dark looking woman to my right (\"Gio-wadge W. Booshe and da otha Boo-wooshes let the Bin-ladens Family fly right out Texas on 9/11 - Da ownlee plane dat was allowed to full-eye on 9/11 -  that's twoo!! That's verifiable!! Check it out ooh-wan line !!\" ) - who was unsuccessfully trying to convince her partner that 9/11 and the Iraq war was an inside job, the crowd was friendly, laughing and a fun atmosphere. Luckily Elvira and friend left (no doubt heading to the Michael Moore film festival) soon after and M&P became a much better place to be.  In town for one night only, I saw the great yelp reviews of M&P and decided to give it a try. In the mood for something light, I decided to sample the wedge salad and, as a recent convert and aspiring bone marrow aficionado decided that to give it a whirl, too.   The recommended Cab was good but not great, the wedge salad was cold, crisp, and just the right amount of blue cheese dressing and fresh blue cheese crumbles. So far , I'm 2 for 2. Over my shoulder I hear \"Your bone Marrow, Sir?\"  Holy Fred-freaking-Flintstone, I'm served the largest portions and sizes of marrow I've ever seen - gynormous even by (my accustomed) Texas standards. Perfectly broiled with grilled bread, sea salt, pickled onions, chive and -surprise!- capers, it was amazingly good. And amazingly rich. And more than one man should eat, even Fred and Barney in their prime. I was semi-successful doling out samples to those around me  - despite the inner voices in my head from my Mom telling me to clean my plate - I had to quit after two of the three bones. This is absolutely awesome and you must try it - just bring a friend or two when feeling especially carnivorous.  Five stars to you M&P - when back in DT PB I will darken your doorway again on the nearest, convenient, Elvira-less night."}
{"text":"Awesome food, amazing place. We've been there 3 or 4 times and can't wait to go back. Have not been disappointed! The pate will blow your mind! Bone marrow is always a must, also."}
{"text":"This restaurant was ok. The macaroni and cheese wasn't the best I have ever had but the environment was very nice.  I think I may have just ordered the wrong thing. I had the pot roast and while it was tender the flavor was a little off for my taste.  Great location for a fun night out with friends."}
{"text":"Meat and Potatoes brunch holds a special place in my heart! 2011-2013, my friends and I probably had brunch at M&P about once a month. Over years, the prices rose, the quality dipped a bit, and the service tanked. Well... Yesterday I gave it another shot again (a friend had made a brunch reservation). With our reservation we were seated right away (instead of the 45 min wait the previous time). The food was fantastic! Our waiter however, was either stretched too thin with tables or just plan bad! NEVER checked on us. We didn't want to be rude but... Another drink, more water, etc. So this is my update... :)"}
{"text":"Fabulous food.  There is a wait for a reservation, but well worth it."}
{"text":"Appealing at first, because of the ambiance and menu, so we made a reservation. We waited 20 minutes before seated for our brunch reservation. We then waited another 15 minutes before anyone acknowledged our existence, once seated.  The waiter came over and excused the wait time, because he was new- understandable, I've worked in the service industry before.  Overall, we were not impressed, and will not return. To keep things short, there seemed to be lack of communication between all staff, the tables are too small for the size of the plates brought out, there is not much space for movement around tables (service, excusing yourself to use the restroom, needless to say, privacy), the coffee was cold, and at the end of my meal, a centipede came crawling out of the booth, and scurried towards me. Eeeek. The food may be decent, and the restaurant has a cool concept, but it lacked the seamless service and comfort, which makes an exceptional restaurant experience."}
{"text":"Great experience overall - friendly waitstaff and bartenders - food was delicious. We ordered the smoked wings and the bone marrow as appetizers. It was so much food - which made me very happy - and really delicious. The smoked wings were by far our favorite. For dinner my husband ordered the lamb shank with white beans and kale - very good and incredibly tender lamb shank. I ordered the duck breast - only complaint - the chimichurri sauce seemed misplaced and combated with the delicious flavor of the duck breast - would order again - but request no chimichurri.   Found this restaurant when in Pittsburgh for a weekend - have already recommended to two different friends planning trips within the next six months.   We weren't able to get reservations until 9:45 - but it was worth the wait. Recommend making reservations a few days beforehand to ensure you get a time slot that works for you. The decor is fun - but was very happy to see that the food out-shined the decor - as sometimes it tends to be the more hip the interior - the less quality the food - not at Meat and Potatoes!"}
{"text":"I have only been completely satisfied by my experiences here.  Great place."}
{"text":"Was able to get a table outside on a Monday night without a reservation. Very good service and the ribeye special was delicious! Also loved the beer & coozie to take home. So glad we got to enjoy dinner here while in town for a few day."}
{"text":"when the place is 1/3 full on a Monday night, no need for the wait staff to act like they are so busy that they can only talk to you in a mad rush, while literally running. Though the food was good, the wait staff need to learn some professionalism and patience.  They also need to learn that their menu is not very common and not everyone is expected to understand what certain things mean on it.   I think the manager needs to have a talk with the wait staff taking orders, most of whom seemed to exclusively young females (while all the bus people were males)."}
{"text":"This place is a must-go! The food and service were fantastic. If you're in the Pittsburgh area and looking for an experience, I highly recommend Meat & Potatoes! They are now open for brunch too...  If you go for brunch, make sure to try the French 76 cocktail. One of the best I've had... Lemongrass infused vodka, champagne, and lemon... Can't go wrong!  Coffee BBQ with eggs and potatoes is a fantastic way to start a lazy weekend!! Will  go back for sure next time I'm in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Good for Pittsburgh, but average compared to other cities. Waitress did not inform us of the special dishes for the night. The table next to us had the specials explained to them after we had already ordered. Would have preferred the special, but not a huge deal. Price is reasonable for what you get."}
{"text":"I was in town and craving a steak and this place was highly rated online and by the hotel staff.   I had the hanger steak which was done perfectly.  The only downside, and perhaps it's because I ate at the bar, was the service was lacking.  I never was asked if the steak was done to my satisfaction, if I wanted another glass of wine or dessert, and had to ask twice for my check.  Despite the lack of service, I'd go back for the great meal."}
{"text":"Good eats here.  Hit this place several times before even thinking about Primanti's sandwiches (soggy, bland, etc.)  The sandwich (3 pig) tasted great.  The meat was moist and flavorful.  The egg was also a tasty addition.  I enjoyed the thick cuts of bread, which were grilled.  Probably top five sandwiches I have eaten anywhere.  Thick. tasty. satisfying.    Of course, this place isn't cheap and I certainly wouldn't mind paying less.    But the cost was justified."}
{"text":"Great 'come as you are bar' with barrel aged Manhattans, brilliant food and hip atmosphere. How can you go wrong?  Always good and a new Pgh stable."}
{"text":"Had reservations on a Saturday night and was seated on time in the private room (we were there for a bachelorette party).  The fried pickles were AHmazing!!  Split the steak and it was also delish.  Only drawback was the service......our waitress only came to check on us once.  A party of 6!  I'd definitely go back but hopefully it will be better service."}
{"text":"I went back for more because I like torture .... ok it was a birthday thing.  Decided to order a Caesar salad....another bad choice unless you like soggy pork rinds and ranch dressing in your Caesar salad. I was told that I should have read what was in their Caesar salad. If you are not using Caesar dressing and other traditional ingredients then why call it a Caesar salad. It would be like ordering fish and chips, but substituting the fish for tofu and the chips for fried chickpeas. So the salad, Ranch Pork Rind salad I will call it was about as tasty as that sounds. No more of my money shall be tKen by this establishment!  1 star stands for the first visit and this one. Would rather go to Olive Garden."}
{"text":"The food and drinks were amazing, spectacular really!  The service was Terrible.  The bar area was way under staffed and they were bitter about it.  One bartender asked another to take our order, which he did followed up by \"It's going to be a while for your cocktails\" in a very rude tone as if we kicked their dog or spit in their face (which we did not).  The bar back was incredibly gracious and very nice, wish we could have ordered from him.  The Pork Chop I would highly recommend, Fred Flinstone would have been envious.  Bone in, huge, cooked perfectly......I actually lucked out ordering.  Couldn't dare ask the server for a recommendation, which I usually prefer since they have insider info. The server came up and smirkily said \"what do you want\" as if we insulted his family (Again, which we did not).    Service - F Food - A++  It'll be a while if ever before we go back though, poor service creates a poor experience regardless of how good the food is."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 6 stars I would. The cocktails are wonderful. The atmosphere is buzzing and fun, never obnoxious. And the food... The food is amazing! Always love stopping in even if just for a few drinks! The bartenders are fabulous and always make the evening enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Are you ready for manly man food served in a manly man setting?  I am!  And thankfully, so was Belle.  I say manly man with my tongue in cheek since M&P owes much to chefs like Gabrielle Hamilton and April Bloomfield, both of whom have been kicking ass in NYC for a few years now.  Bone marrow on toast may be the single most ripped off dish of the last decade or so--this place takes it from Hamilton, who stole it from Fergus Henderson.  Is that a problem?  No!  Bone marrow isn't something you really expect to see on many Pittsburgh menus, so I won't call into question any cook's motives if I end up eating it.  Smack in the middle of the theater district, M&P is a good date spot--the lighting ranges from \"romantic\" to \"theoretical.\"  Yes, it's convenient, but more importantly it offers you many chances to put your date in situations in which you can evaluate him/her as a prospect.  1. It has a good bar.  If I have to explain to a bartender on Carson St. what goes into a Blood & Sand, I don't want that guy making a Blood & Sand.  Or anything.  But that's not the case here, so you can observe what your date drinks given a wide array of options.  Guys manage to screw this up all the time and yes, girls notice.  Beer (12 oz?  Before dinner?) and lite [sic] beer (ever?) will doom you.  Ordering something like absinthe (available here) is doable, but for God's sake don't go into some overly-long explanation about the green fairy.  Absinthe hasn't been like that for ages.  That's like getting excited about drinking dairy because before refrigeration, it was a risky proposition.  2. Its menu takes a small token of skill to decode.  Every restaurant is required by law (-ish) to have the following items on the menu: random, bland chicken breast dish; chocolate dessert with a lavish description (pick from: forbidden/dream/fantasy/some other erotic term that reinforces the unhealthy cultural relationship between women and food); fish with really boring sides; pasta (usually vegetarian, giving non-carnivores and the thrifty an option).  At a bad restaurant, you stick to these because it's hard to really really screw up pasta, but at a good restaurant, you skip these because the cook just put them on the menu as a nod to less adventurous eaters--certainly not you!  I have never had the salmon at M&P.  I'm sure it's fine.  Salmon is tough to screw up.  I will never have M&P's salmon.  Why would you ever go to a place with pictures of cows and pigs on the wall, a place obviously intended to be a shrine to all things pork and beef and order fish?  It's clearly not the passion of the chef and can be safely skipped.  So if your date orders the salmon, the ravioli, or even the \"Plain Jane\" burger, be wary.  3. If your dining companion orders any beef dish from a place like this well done, make an excuse and leave.   M&P is not a pretentious place, but it takes its meat seriously.  Don't let someone insult the cooks or the food like that.  When I order something well done (once every 3 years), I'm saying, \"I assume the kitchen in this diner is a festering pit of bacteria and this is the only way I can think of to kill it all.\"  With all these lessons in mind, Belle and I ordered a sea of appetizers (marrow, tartare, and so on) and a lamb entree to split.  Aside from perhaps a little too much binder in the tartare and slightly uninspiring accompaniments with the lamb, everything was excellent.  Nothing life altering, just tasty, solid food that was fun to eat.   This place takes its muscular eating seriously--steaks are served on cutting boards, wine is served in jars, everything has capers.  It's a gastropub, which means no one is going to be blown away by some intricate little molecular trick the kitchen uses.  But if you're in the mood for a plate of bones straight out of the Flintstones to be placed in front of you, this is your place."}
{"text":"Divine, start to finish!  I was in Pittsburgh for the Vet Games. It was Friday night, 11PM, my guy had been playing rugby all day... He needed food and I needed beer. This place was pushing distance from our hotel by the Convention Center, so we decided to check it out.  I called to make sure the kitchen was still open and got Mike at the front desk. He was hilarious on the phone and told us to come over. He was equally amusing when we got there. Bonus point - we hadn't mentioned that we had a wheelchair in our party. It's not usually a big deal, we just move a chair, whatever. We got there and Mike just said he had the best seat in the house for us and would be right back after the 'final preparations.' That was the politest way we've ever heard someone leave to move a chair without making a big deal out of it. A small thing, but it was one of many cute touches throughout our meal and a nice way to start.  Atmosphere is fun, the chalk drawing with the different edible parts of a cow was awesome. There's a fine line between trendy and pretentious and they totally made it.  Food - oh yes. We started with the fries with truffle mayo (string fries, delicious) and the lobster mac 'n cheese (mmm.) I got the mushroom flatbread which was perfect and Jeff got the tomahawk - a huge steak on the bone (shaped like a tomahawk) with chive butter and steak fries. All our food was incredible and we had plenty of leftovers.  The draught selection was on the small side, but they had a super random selection of cans and bottles. It's been a few years since I've lived out east so it was fun to try some new beer. They had an elaborate bar but we weren't able to take advantage of all that.  All in all, great. Host, waitress, food, drinks... I have no idea when I'll be in Pittsburgh again but I would definitely go out of my way if I was in town!"}
{"text":"Wings wings wings!!! I love them. Smoked with a house made spicy not too hot with a little sweet. I love the mussel dishes. Usually three preparations to choose from. Order the grilled bread or side of fries as the add on. You will want something to soak up all the broth!! Both Hot chicken and burgers are outstanding! I love the cocktails with the house made bitters and syrups. Great Old Fashions! Good luck finding a seat at the bar!"}
{"text":"We made reservations for 7 and were seated very close to that time. However, when we walked in the 2 hostesses at the station were both on the phone and did not acknowledge us until a third hostess came to the station. Once we were seated our waitress came and got us started pretty quickly. My husband got a beer and I just stuck with water (pregnant but the alcohol selection looks awesome!) and I have to say it was poured out of glass bottles but is clearly warm (yes, no ice) tap water. We ordered the special (meat plate) and the devils on horse back and both were fantastic! I do wish the waitress would have explained what each meat was but it didn't matter because they were all delicious! We got the rib eye for two. Best steak I have ever had in my life, loved the house made steak sauce. All in all great night and food. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Overall: An excellent lunch and dinner experience. The service accommodating, the drinks well-balanced, and the food savory, if slightly rich. An easy choice for Pittsburgh fine-dining. __________________________________________ Ambiance (4/5): One room and large, so it doesn't get to \"chill\", but otherwise very relaxed, festive, and modern, if a little chatty from the other guests and expansive from the very-large bar.  one room and a small private table with door, industrial feel with pipes and low-power lights hanging from the high ceilings above. bar of 20. high ceilings, rustic wall mounts of deer heads, greens hang from lights for Christmas, tree lit in corner. Soft ambiance play from above, hum to the place. __________________________________________ Service (4/5): Prompt, if stand-off, arguably \"know it all\" in delivery, but exceptionally accommodating during lunch and overall very genial and helpful.  Immediate water and refills, long list of suggestions with general portion sizes indicated. Recommendations were as described. Took a bit of time delivering between appetizers though restaurant fairly packed.  I returned for lunch the next day.. 35 minutes after the kitchen had closed! I placed an order at 1:55, they cooked it and put it at the bar. It was still warm, waiting, when I arrived at 2:35. I never felt rushed sitting down this late, and they accommodated me perfectly. __________________________________________ Drinks (5/5): Mixed drinks have a fantastic balance of flavor, alcohol, and texture. Small craft beer selection.  1) sloe gin fizz - awesome lightness with gin and citrus, juniper a bit lost but consistency creamy with egg. Fantastic stuff.  2) Sgt peppers old fashioned - bitters and orange work well together, pull out bourbon oak and heat while tempering. Pepper keeps drink light, very low sugar presence compared to sometimes over sweetened profile. One of the best old fashioneds I've drank. Another winner! __________________________________________ Food (4/5): Aside from a few textural shortcuts and missteps, this is excellent cuisine, both lunch and dinner. Rich and hearty yet balanced and inventive, I look forward to trying another round.  1) tartare - spicy from the chili bowl-glaze and Jalapeno crunch! Soft boiled egg sits atop (done perfectly). Seaweed definitely noticeable. Light onion as well. Quality meat, lighter smoke unnoticeable unless you separate from fixins. Peanut adds a distinguished crunch though the flavor contrasts a bit. Lighter, more conflicted from so many ingredients, not as rustic or simple. I prefer softer texture of bittering agents like arugula, black pepper, and capers to the harsher texture here, and the spice heat slightly hides meat, but very good stuff.  2) Bone marrow - rich, fatty melt in mouth, nice use of salt, white onion, caper to cut richness though still a lot. Bread is hearty, absorbs marrow easily, but could be a bit crisper, though richness may overpower otherwise and sopping marrow out of bone is made easier. The coarse sea-salt is a textural issue against the marrow. It's gritty and cracks as the marrow melts in your mouth while you attempt chewing the bread.  3) Tort sandwich - really crunchy bread. Light! Avocado cuts jalapeno sting, pork fat, radishes maintain levity. Waves of flavor, first light jalapeno and pickled radish, then brash mango aioli and avocado, light pork and smoke following as spice builds, before the toasty crunch finish. Really subtle, in control. Lightly dry without aioli.  4) Mac and cheese - served in mini cast iron! thick! Lightly sweet, little burnt aspect so low textural contrast. Light influence from chorizo, hearty lightly stinging. Really solid and rich, though texturally a bit boring. She agreed.. \"thick, rich\".."}
{"text":"Do not eat here!! The service was terrible and I got sick from the overly salty steak. There are far better places in downtown Pittsburgh.  Trust me. I eat out for a living."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the *elite* pittsburgh restaurants! Went with the family for my graduation and had an epic meal. We shared two orders of the ribeye steak for two. In addition to being an impressive presentation, the meat was juicy and perfectly cooked. I feel like it used to have a nice rosemary flavor so this time felt a little under seasoned but I know lots of people like a \"simpler the better\" approach to steaks. The Bramble cocktail satisfied the rosemary urge so I was okay. Have also had great brunch there. Can't really go wrong at m&p!"}
{"text":"I've been here thrice. Twice for brunch and once for dinner.   Big fan of the brunch. I've heard oodles and oodles of good things about the Bloody Mary bar, but have yet to try it myself.   I got the Irish Benedict. Fantastic. But very, very filling. I wouldn't have traded it for anyone else's dish, though. Bit bland, but if you like Hollandaise Sauce, M&P has a good one.   I also had the Fried Chicken & Waffles. The maple syrup served with it was great. It made the dish. Not like regular maple syrup, this was a little thinner, with bacon bits in it. The fried chicken was fairly spicy as well, which I liked, gave it a zing.   Dinner was good, but nothing special. They do an excellent job cooking their meat. I had lamb and I got to try some of my friend's mutton, which was very tender, very soft.   I love the restaurant space, with the mirrors around the walls, and the chalkboards. Sometimes I think I come more for the atmosphere, environment, and people-watching more than the food.   But don't get me wrong. The food's good. Like real good. So you should go. But definitely make a reservation. At least one week out because the place fills up fast."}
{"text":"After a great show at the neighboring O'Reilly theater, my friend and I treated ourselves to a great dinner at Meat & Potatoes. Since we did not have a reservation, we ate at the bar, which was comfortable and offered a great ambience. (It was a bonus that some if the cast from the play say there as well.). I'm a pescatarian, so hold the meaty dishes for me; my choices were limited. I had a pasta dish with salmon which was well prepared and not too heavy. Wine list was great; tho I'm not a fan of the stemless glassware. No biggie tho."}
{"text":"Second time we've been here and it doesn't disappoint.  Had a reservation for 6:45, but they were great and seated us early.  Buttermilk chicken livers, Devil's Backbone for appetizers, Sgt. Pepper's Old Fashioned, great entrees and outstanding service from Kate!  Looking forward to next visit!"}
{"text":"Good food, especially BRUNCH. The cocktails are unique & I used to have a favorite bartender there (I think their name was Abby) but I haven't seem them in a while! Hope all is well, Abby. Still great service all around. It's expensive but it's Downtown PGH so, kind of expected.."}
{"text":"The idea of this restaurant is spot on -- high end cocktails and high end comfort food. The execution, though, is lacking. I ordered two versions of a Manhattan from their cocktail list. Great flavor, but they serve their cocktails in very wide saucer glasses. This just warms up the drinks more quickly than a smaller glass, and a warm cocktail is no one's friend. They pour their wine generously, and the glass selection is great.  I had fries -- fine, but the flavored mayo that came with them lacked flavor. Then I had the harvest salad, which was nice, but strangely cold, like it had just been taken from a fridge. I liked the spare dressing, however. Next came one of the night's specials -- grilled cheese with tomato soup. The soup was great. The sandwich was cold and I only ate one bite of it.  Maybe with more time they'll get their game on. The space is lovely, the servers were friendly, and the central bar is beautiful."}
{"text":"Meat and potatoes is a lively fun place. Food is superb. I had flat iron steak. It was perfectly cooked and full of flavor. My husband had pot roast. Also very good. We shared truffle fries. Excellent. Don't miss lemon angel food cake with raspberry sorbet. A little pricey but worth every penny."}
{"text":"The consistency in the food and drinks are so very appreciated. The service is great and I enjoy my visit each and every time. Had a DJ on a Monday I was there..  Was great music but regardless the playlist was always appropriate. Definitely a place to check out if not for anything but their prohibition drinks"}
{"text":"A-OK. Which is unfortunate because we still gave Meat & Potatoes a try after hearing from a Pittsburgh local that has visited multiple times that the atmosphere is a real let-down and the food is good. However, the atmosphere created can ruin a meal, no matter how delicious the food.  Reading other reviews, I see that other people also commented on the incredibly poor customer service of the hostesses. Hosts and hostesses set-up the atmosphere of a restaurant. If the people \"welcoming\"you to the restaurant show that they are disinterested through their body language of slouching against the counter, not welcoming you first when you enter because they are paying attention to their phones, not asking how they can help you, giving attitude by sighing when you do not have a reservation, and not guiding you to the area where you can wait, it can ruin an entire experience. Which unfortunately because of two young hostesses it did. It was like being greeted by two angsty teenagers.  Our expected wait for the patio was 10 minutes (I am not sure what the wait was for inside because the hostesses did not tell us) e received a text from an automated system to be seated sooner. Coming back there was another hostess, who I talked to later in the evening about our experience with the younger hostesses. This other hostess has worked at Meat & Potatoes longer and was very kind and cheerful and took my comment politely and apologized for our experience. We were seated by the 'less' disinterested or maybe trying a little harder at her job, younger hostess who was at least standing upright when we walked in to the patio.  We were seated outside on the patio, which was lovely even for a hot day and the interior of the restaurant was very dark, loud, and you could smell all the food being served which was not necessarily pleasant. However, every so often smells which included everything from garbage and human smells if you know what I mean, from the alley which the patio was situated in (blocked off by a short fence) was a worse smell. In addition to sitting outside at the patio, there is only a small fence barrier to the alley and street, a group of people passed by and started berating customers that we were eating the 'cockroaches' they saw in the alley.  Our waitress, Crystal, was incredible. Her pleasant nature, positive conversation, knowledge about the menu definitely made the night for us. She came back often to refill our water for us, check in how we were doing, and apologized profusely for forgetting some lemons we asked for the water which was really not necessary, definitely appreciated.  We ordered fried pickles and Poutine from the Snacks menu, the 45oz ribeye and Sgt. Pepper's Old Fashioned to drink. Crystal and the server who brought out our snacks suggested we eat the Poutine quickly while it was hot which would allow the fried pickles to cool down, that information is always appreciated! The ribeye from 'build your own meat & potatoes for two' for $75 is a great deal as it definitely could serve at least four people. It was beautifully displayed on bone with the bone marrow gratin resting across and we ordered it with black truffle butter an extra $4 served in a small glass jar which was filled with black truffle and herbs. The food was excellent. I loved the thin cut fries of the Poutine and the scallion added a acidic contrast to the curds and gravy, but I would have preferred more gravy on them. The fried pickles order was small, but had a perfect breading that did not get soggy. The ribeye was perfectly cooked rare and the bone marrow gratin was oozing with deliciousness.  I would say that all three of us in my party enjoyed the meal, unfortunately the earlier experience of the hostesses actually caused one of my party members to leave before the ribeye, which ruined an otherwise lovely day in Pittsburgh. The food was fairly priced for the quality you are receiving. Our waitress Crystal made the night easy, the horrid detachment of the hostesses, smells and openness public jeering added to cutting our appetite short and our early leave. If we ever come back to Meat & Potatoes, we will not come sit at the restaurant.  I hope they do take-out."}
{"text":"Meat and potatoes simultaneously redefines and honors the historically blue collar experience that is Pittsburgh. This gastropub crafted impressive mixed drinks that satiate a palatte yearning for \"something different.\" The Pimm's Blue Ribbon shows off how versatile and tasty PBR can be when combined with the right liqour. Old Canadian and the Old Thyme Refresher also were both were expertly crafted, showing off the refined techniques of the mixologist behind the bar by utilizing freshly made mixers, simple syrups, and liqueurs rarely found in your common neighborhood bar. This particular night, we were served the bolognese and the salmon. The bolognese contained three types of meats (pork shoulder, short rib and pancetta) in a mind blowing concoction over a melt in your mouth gnocchi. While this is traditionally served over papardelle, the gnocchi was a home run with this sauce. The salmon was served in with a korean style kim chi laden slaw that was not your run of the mill, overwhelming kim chi flavor. Kudos to the chef for balancing this flavor with the delicate texture of the fish. The atmosphere was a bit loud, but not obtrussive (the chairs are super comfortable!!!!!). Service was not astounding but not obnoxious either. This is a must visit for foodies and non-foodies alike. There's something to satisfy everyone at a reasonable price (even the little boy at the next table over with his most excellent hot dog seemed pleased, and we all know that children are the harshest critics!). Support your local establishments and keep this place alive! It could be the next great tradition in a city filled with traditions."}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant in PGH  -- love the brunch.  Absolutely love the housemade granola, ricotta and toast."}
{"text":"Service is inept, food is nothing special and the prices are far too high. This place is all hype and no substance. There are many good dining options in downtown, sadly this place misses the mark. Save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Everything is amazing here, the food, the cocktails, the decor and the people-watching.  The Bloody Mary bar on Sunday is worth the trip, as are the mac n cheese and the mussels.  Reservations are helpful, but if you can snag a seat at the bar before your show, the service is phenomenal there, too."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere...requested and received table outside based on reviews seen here. Our server was attentive and food was prepared promptly. We had the fried Brussel sprouts which I liked but my dinner companion felt were way too salty and fried to the point of verging on burnt.  The Pimento Mac N cheese was good but not outstanding.  We also shared an order of mussels cooked in a tomato cream basil sauce.  The order was plentiful and the sauce was very good, but the quality of the mussels was inconsistent...some being quite small.  I really wanted to like this restaurant but I felt like for the quality of the food, the prices weren't justified."}
{"text":"Everything that we ordered was amazing!  I highly recommend eating here any chance you get.  The food is outstanding, the cocktails are amazing, and the staff was fantastic.  One of the best restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"What is better than catching a bite before the show at Heinz Hall? Doing it with a friend at Meat and Potatoes! A few cocktails while catching up... followed by the ever popular mussels, and a special that included steak with red wine risotto and a few chunks of blue cheese. This place is tight, and noisy, but still a crowd pleaser and one of our faves."}
{"text":"Had heard about this restaurant for quite some time, so we tried this during Pittsburgh's winter Restaurant Week. We had three courses, however, our personal favorite was their mac n cheese. If it was socially acceptable, I would have smacked the table after my first bite, it was amazing.   Really nice atmosphere, somewhat difficult to find because you have to walk into the theatre. Definitely more upscale."}
{"text":"Services was slow. Food was just so so. The restaurant itself was quite charming if not a little crammed. If you are going around a show time - you will need to make reservations.   I had the wild mushroom risotto for my appetizer. It was pretty good. I should have had that as my main item and when with another appetizer. I had the sweetbread piccata. It was way too garlicky and it left a bad taste in my mouth. The meat was too 'tender' for me. Apparently it is an acquired taste and lets just say I'm not acquiring it.   I might go back one more time to try something else."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. Food quantities are absolutely embarrassingly small for the price. Mussels are so tiny you need a microscope to see them. Busboy hit a member of my party in the head with a tray. Just kept walking. Never again."}
{"text":"M&P was awesome.  Went there for my birthday and it was excellent.  We only had drinks and appetizers but both were excellent.  If you're into great cocktails and unique food options, M&P is the choice in the Burgh. CP"}
{"text":"The Mac-n Cheese appetizer is delicious, the pasta I had as a main dish was something completely different it's great to taste something out of the basics! Staff and ambient where great as well even on New Year's Eve :)"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to try this place when I came on a business trip to Pittsburgh. I had to get a to-go order because of a conference call I had at my hotel.  I ordered a drink while waiting for the order. The drink was really good. I got my food and went to the hotel 4min away from the restaurant. I had ordered bone marrow for an appetizer and hanger steak for a main. The bone marrow app was missing the bread that goes with it! And.. one of the marrows was undercooked :(  The hanger steak was ice cold and chewy. On top of that, they did not provide me with utensils!  I was very disappointed."}
{"text":"Delicious! I really enjoyed all of the dishes. The service wasn't outstanding, hence the subtraction of one star. I'll definitely be back next time I'm in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Shared a signature Ribeye along with mashed and mushrooms with a colleague and it was very, very tasty and extremely filling.  You could probably serve three people with that huge steak.  Service was good as well.  My only nit (and hence 4 stars) is that the dinky, dull steak knives they provide are useless.  These are the little wooden handle, $10 for a case type that you got at the Goodwill store in college.  Even though the meat was pretty tender, it was very difficult to cut.  The server said they keep fighting with the manager to buy new, larger knives.  I've eaten at steak joints all over the world and gotta say, this is the only time I've had to complain about cutlery.    So if Mr Meat & Potatoes Manager reads these, don't be a cheapskate, please go buy some real steak knives so I can easily cut that wonderful piece of meat!"}
{"text":"good cocktail, good apps, good entrees. solid choice in Pittsburgh.  Being from NYC, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food, presentation and variety."}
{"text":"Excellent brunch. Great bloody mary bar. But they definitely nickel and dime you. I ordered toast that clearly said on the menu jam was included...but they then charged me $1 additional when I asked for it. Make reservations as they are always packed. Will be back again.. but skipping the jam next time ;)"}
{"text":"Best Fried Chicken I've had outside of the south. Brunch was fantastic."}
{"text":"This restaurant is simply incredible. I have been going here now for some time and love it every time. We have been for dinner, as well as a couple of times for weekend brunch. I strongly believe that M&P would hold its own in restaurant markets like New York (in fact, I'm always telling my friends n NYC that if this restaurant was in Manhattan you would need to reserve a table a month in advance at least to get in). The menu is full of highlights. Everything is delicious! I am in particular a fan of the brussels sprouts and poutine on the snack menu, the tartare on the appetizer menu, and pretty much all the entrees. The pub burger is a standout--in my mind one of the best burgers in the country, and certainly at the level of the famed Black Label burger at the Minetta Tavern in NYC."}
{"text":"I'll just get the small negative out of the way first.  The host/hostess station is not sunshine and rainbows.  The theme music would probably be The Cure or Dashboard Confessional for the group milling about there.  Not welcoming at all.  That being said, the rest of the experience is amazing!  The brunch was fantastic complete with a $7 bloody Mary bar which, in my opinion, is a steal considering the amount of things to skewer and place in your bloody.  We got the grilled bread, steak omelet (omelet of the day) and the pot roast hash.  The winners of the day were the grilled bread, the cheesy potatoes that came with the omelet, and the pot roast hash.  Our server was awesome as well.  Great place for brunch!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here to celebrate our second wedding anniversary.  We wanted to try something new and asked for some recommendations from friends.  Meat and Potatoes did not disappoint! We made reservations a week or so in advance for a Saturday night.  It was very busy but we did not have to wait for our table.  The wait staff was very knowledgeable and friendly.  They congratulated us on our anniversary.  We asked questions about different dishes on the menu and they provided us with some excellent recommendations. We both one of the specials which was a delicious chicken dish.  We were also surprised by a bottle of wine from a Canadian winery that we love that friends of ours had left at the restaurant.  The fact that they did that for us and served it as a surprise speaks volumes to the kind of people that run the restaurant.  It was a bit crowded in the dining room. You are right next to the tables next to you so you cannot really have private conversations.  (I also feel for the waitstaff who have to make their way around everyone and everything with trays). I only docked points for the crowded feel and the noise. We will be back to try the other amazing dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"The food I had was delicious the service was okay too. It's just way too crowded in there. I understand it's a popular restaurant but it's nearly impossible to walk around to even get to the table. If you don't mind the hustle and bustle I definitely recommend it but for a romantic and personable time I do not. You may as well be sitting at the same table as the people next to you."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying.... I did NOT eat here.    I called 2 weeks out, in advance for a reservation.  I was told they were booked, that they have a seperate dinning room for walk-ins only.  Today, when I called tonight, to see if we could possibly get in... the lady told me no.  I asked about walk-ins and she said they are completely booked.  I asked about the seperate dinning room for walks ins, thinking we could take our chances....she said that dinning room was booked for a reservation!  WHAT???  I am NOT going to work that hard to spend my $$.  I was calm, cool and collected and told the lady how disappointed I was.  She said, \"oh that is just too bad\"."}
{"text":"Meat & Potatoes get 5 stars for food and 2-3 stars for service.  The food is great, near amazing.  Tasted everything at the table, which ranged from Roasted Branzino, to Risotto to the Pub Burger.  For a Meat & Potato place, they did fish (Branzino) and risotto some of the best I have ever had.  The Pub Burger was nothing short of amazing.  Loved it.  Maybe death row last meal good.  Decent selection of beers, nothing to write home about but a few good small craft choices.  Good bar and good place for drinks and snacks as well as a meal.  The service is a different story.  Our server, Emily, I think we were actually bothering her to be there.  Seemed not to want to work or take care of customers.  Also, we asked her what Devil of Horseback was (a small plate).  She described it wonderfully and the four of us all oohed and aahed.  She neglected to tell us only 3 came on the plate.  She could have told us and offered to add a fourth or tell us to get two.  She seemed experienced just full of attitude.  Based on some other reviews, may be a common theme so be forewarned.  Overall small place but really good food with under attentive staff."}
{"text":"Dinner here was one of the most memorable meals i've had in Pittsburgh.  I LOVE that this restaurant captures the pride & humor of the city.  ie: *Fried pickles served in a paper tray, on a silver platter with spicy ranch dressing. Ha! & Yum! *Mac-n Cheese with chorizo, pulled pork, & \"government cheese\" Yes, please!  Coat me in this ambrosia & walk away. *Perfectly cooked Pastrami crusted duck served with sauerkraut pierogies & dandelion greens-- BRILLIANT.  The entire menu is peppered with \"wink wink, nudge nudge\" moments--like puns but with food.  This is exactly what i want from a gastropub--refined & delicious food that isn't stuffy.  These are ingredients you WANT TO EAT paired or prepared in unexpected ways.  The restaurant is a bit loud, but still quite comfortable.  I was ecstatic to see a proper cocktail menu in Pittsburgh & recommend the Up In Smoke--the whiskey balances the salty smorgasbord before you.  Go with a group, order everything & share.  The portions are generous & the plates are lick-the-china delicious."}
{"text":"What a great, cute, romantic little place! Service was great.   The food was awesome!!  We ordered the \"Meat and Potatoes for Two: 34 oz. Ribeye\" - extremely yummy! Lots of flavor and marbling (my favorite part of a ribeye). Mushroom ragu on top was like icing on a cake. Delicious! The steak fries were about normal when it comes to steak fries, but dipped in the black truffle mayo (worth it for an extra $1 to have it on the side), they were almost up there with being as delicious as the steak (sort of kidding, but really good dipped in the mayo)!!  The bone marrow gratin was a first time try for me! It was actually fairly good, very fatty flavor, and I wouldn't go out of my way to eat it, but I am glad I tried it (plus it came with the entree).  Artisanal cheese board as an appetizer was yummy also. 3 different cheese, and some fruits, and the preserve was lovely!! It comes with some bread too.  I wish we had saved room for dessert - maybe next time.  The tables are a bit tiny."}
{"text":"not as good as it could be. I've been here at least a dozen times, I leave satisfied but never wow that was awesome. brunch is my more favorite time to go"}
{"text":"Amazing meal. Happened across them on a walk from my hotel and returned later with friends. The atmosphere is fantastic, and the drink menu would be worth a visit in and of itself. I sampled three flatbreads, all were excellent flavor combinations. We split small plates as well, and I sampled the mac and cheese and the poutine... Both were amazing. My only caveat would be to be cautious when ordering - the dishes are so rich we took half of our food home! If I make it back to Pittsburgh, Meat and Potatoes is on my must-do list."}
{"text":"Several months after M&P had opened, i ate there one night as a walk-in and was seated within minutes on a Friday night around 9:30pm. The food was so delicious, I was truly impressed. So, for some time shortly after, i regularly brought friends and family there to dine. Literally, no matter whether one was seated at the bar or on the floor, the service was excellent, on par with some of the more expensive casual dining establishments in New York City.    Then, due to a change in my regular routine, and because my friend was between shows at CLO, I stopped dining there so regularly, and ended up not returning to the place for several years.  Well, i worked in a research lab at Pitt for many years, and we would often have doctors working with us for a year or two to fulfill a post-doc or fellowship program, many of whom are not from Pittsburgh, or even the U.S.  So i recommended M&P as a \"fantastic\" place to dine after a new doc asked for a recommendation of somewhere to eat in the Theater District at some point a year or so after I ceased being an M&P \"semj-regular.\" You can imagine how foolish I felt to have her return to me the following Monday only to relay the message that she had a terrible experience.   Then, fast-forward 2 years (now this is about a year and a half ago), and Im at the Christmas market with my \"new\" boyfriend in Market Square. We had a wonderful afternoon, but suddenly our hunger crept up on us, and we realized we were going to get \"hangry\" before we could wait out a table at Nola or anything immediately in Market Square, so I think of M&P and feel assured - as it was only about 4:30pm at the time - that we could get a table quickly for a quick bite to eat before their dinner rush came in.  Now, by this time, Meat & Potatoes had apparently become a \"popular\" place to eat - and the rumor was it was so posh, you had to wait weeks for a reservation; but for a place called Meat & Potatoes, it should be pretty obvious how ridiculous that wait time should seem.  Well, we arrive, and its about 4:45pm - the hostess asks us if we've made a reservation. I say no, and she says with a shitty attitude, \"Oh, well, I'm sorry, we're booked for the night, and we strongly recommend you make a reservation with us *weeks* in advance\" - she emphasizes \"weeks.\" Thats the end of the conversation as far as this dipshit is concerned.   So, i calmly asked her if there was bar seating available - and then she tells me, yes, in fact, it's first come first serve. Well, how lovely - seeing as how they were closed between 2:30 and 5pm to turn over before their dinner rush, and we happened to be there right as the doors were opening at 5pm. So- because I asked - we were told we could be seated at the bar in about 10 minutes. But here's the thing: I have since never gone back nor recommended the place to anyone bc i will never again risk bringing someone and having a hostess piss them off.    Here's a short list of places I would recommend, instead: Sienna Mercado, Nola, or Sharp Edge if you want comfort food. Tako if you want pretentiousness and ambience for half the same price, wait time, and minus the bitchy hostesses Ten Penny if you want pretentiousness, ambience, and decent food but little to no wait time  And if what you want is fantastic food with no pretentiousness, AND little to no wait time, then skip downtown altogether and go to Lawrenceville.  Umami/Izakaya is fantastic Japanese street food and a unique ambience within Pittsburgh. It sits above Cantina which has decent tacos and good happy hour drink specials. Piccolo Forno nearby offers delicious italian fare for cheap, and is BYOB. But if you like grappa, dont hesitate to have a drink or two at the grapperia behind the restaurant while waiting for your table, or as a night cap. Tender, further toward the 50s on Butler St, is like a 1930s art deco oasis with crafted cocktails anywhere from $9-15 a pop; they're worth it and they're the star of this place. There's BrilloBox on Penn Ave & Main St, which is, in my opinion, hands down one of the best \"bar food\" experiences you can possibly have in Pittsburgh (there and maybe Yesterday's in Greenfield), and even the vegan food at this joint is so fantastic, even I choose it from the menu from time to time, despite my intense distrust of anything \"vegan.\"   I mean, i can keep going, but the point is, Meat & Potatoes developed hype because its service was once top notch and its food was inventive and a delight to one's senses. But, sadly, it seems to have become rather lackluster in the minds of many, including my own."}
{"text":"This place is so freaking good I can't even get into it. I wish I could get in here more often but I just might go broke. Had some excellent cocktails, I figured hey I don't drink wild drinks that often so I asked the bartender to make me something with bourbon. Whatever he made me was incredible, I think he told me it was called pushing up daisies or something along those lines.   Once we were seated, definitely need reservations here, which we had. We had some risotto as an appetizer. This actually should have been my main course. It was perfectly cooked and so creamy owww! Then next was a steak and rib entree, which I ordered medium-rare, once again on point and so delicious. The special lady ordered the pot pie, And I have to admit it was the best pot pie I have ever had and to top it off it was so large I ended up eating for another 2 days afterwords.   The only thing that was sort of stupid was that I got charged $0.75 for a to go jar for my desert? What gives ?! I just spent over $100 not including tip and your going to pull a  maneuver like that. I mean what's $0.75 on top of my $40 bar tab and $75 dinner bill. It's just the point of it all. I still love this place anyway. The people and service are great and the food kicks butt too!"}
{"text":"SPOT ON! Really liked everything about the place, Going back ext time i'm in town for Fried pickles !"}
{"text":"Service was pretty good, no complaints. The food, however, is just not that good! I'm not sure how this place compares to other local restaurants, since I no longer live in the area. I would much rather trade their huge portions for better quality food and preparation. I had the brussels which weren't crunchy. My pork was super thick and very difficult to cut. My father had the cassoulet and thought it was too salty.   Bone marrow was good, but they serve it with all types of toppings to conceal the fact that the bone marrow isn't very tasty without them!   Again, I'm not super aware of the options in Pittsburgh, since I no longer live here, but my guess is that you can find better. This place isn't as good as it used to be."}
{"text":"Pork belly tacos and the pappardelle...amazing!"}
{"text":"I went for brunch.  It was pretty good, but definitely didnt feel like i was getting a great brunch at this price point.  The potatoes were under-cooked, and the brisket hash was just alright"}
{"text":"If you are feeling hungry with a fellow carnivore, I recommend the Meat and Potatoes for two.  A 36oz Ribeye with potato wedges and bone marrow butter for $55.  Yummo!  Burgers are also really great!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite dinner spots downtown with dishes that are a bit pricey (for the Pittsburgh market) but well-executed. Never really have been let down with food options here plus they have a reasonable selection of beers. Always busy so make sure to make a reservation beforehand! I haven't had the brunch here so all my comments are for dinner but I will say I've heard good things about the brunch. It's on my to do list...  On a side note, Monday nights after 10 PM they have industry night for the folks who are in the restaurant industry. They offer $8 bites and drink specials- definitely worth checking out if you're out late on a Monday.   Food: I've eaten a number of dishes here and quite frankly have never been disappointed. It is, in true Pittsburgh fashion, rather decadent so don't go if you're on a diet. My favorites: Snacks/Apps- fried taters with black truffle mayo (the mayo really sells it in my opinion), Mac n cheese (a generous serving of mixed in chorizo packs in a nice punch of flavor; eat and expect an impending nap), fried brussels (my favorite but again, not the healthy kind your mom made you eat as a kid) Entrees- lamb burger (just all-in-all well executed burger), pork chop   Also if you're there for industry night on Monday, I believe the menu may rotate each time but if poutines are on the menu (see picture) go for Asian Persuasion and Southern Pride. Three poutine dishes was more than plenty for 4 of us following an appetizer or two.   Drinks: Had a mixed experience with cocktails here. Not all that impressed with them so if you're on the fence about a cocktail or draft beer, I'd steer towards the latter. They seem to always have a few interesting ones on tap. If you're looking for a place for a quick drink with friends downtown and are willing to stand at the bar, it's a worthwhile stop.   Ambience: Matches the food- lots of wood, warm and dimly lit. As I alluded to before, it's a nice way to prep you for the food coma to come. The place seems busy often do not a quiet romantic date spot but certainly trendy and interesting enough for a date or with a few friends. Large groups would probably be difficult to seat here- haven't tried before.   Service: Generally good although can be a bit slower when things are busy. Never had issues so far."}
{"text":"Maybe I am biased because I live in Manhattan but this place is beyond mediocre.  The service, the drinks, and especially the food.  Terrible salmon, over buttered toast for the bone marrow, over spiced kim chi, wilted and overcooked vegetables.  And the service - sub par."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant!  Reservations are a must, but it is also well worth the wait.  If you do not make reservations, there is a nice area to sit outside of the restaurant.  I've been there for both lunch and dinner (never brunch, but I hear it is awesome). The atmosphere is trendy, yet comfortable.  Food is great, but nothing out of the ordinary - classics with their own twist.  Perfect for a date or dinner with friends."}
{"text":"What a great place. The Decor was great. Our waitress was very nice and really worked to please us. The Kobe beef melted in my mouth and the mashed potatoes were like my mother used to make. You will enjoy eating here."}
{"text":"I was beyond excited to try meat and potatoes for the first time. We had reservations for 7 pm and got seated right away. Shortly after we were seated our waitress came to take our orders. Everything was going perfect.. Until an hour and a half later and we still had not received food. This would be acceptable if the waitress would have came to our table to apologize or to let us know that it would be just a little bit longer, but she did not.   Once the food did arrive, however, it was amazing. I ordered the salmon, which was delicious. Some people in my party had the duck and others had the hanger steak and burgers.   Once it was time for dessert we asked to see a menu and the waitress said that they only did desserts verbally. Then she never said what the desserts were. So we left still hungry with no dessert.  Overall, if you have the time, it's worth the wait for the food. I would rate the food 5/5 and the service a 2/5."}
{"text":"made reservations for dinner for our last nite of our trip in Pittsburgh. Make sure to make a reservation because the place is always busy and packed. Parking is street parking only in the middle of downtown. My bf and I shared the meal for 2 which consists of a 45oz ribeye with bone marrow gratin and side and sauce (these r extra charges). The ribeye was cooked perfectly medium rare. We ordered the brussel sprouts as a side and the house steak sauce. For our appetizer we ordered the buttermilk chicken livers and the chocolate pot de creme for dessert. We will definitely be coming back here when we visit Pittsburgh again=)"}
{"text":"Another good Yelp-aided restaurant choice in Pittsburgh.... and another hit!  Thanks Yelp.   It was a nice night in Pittsburgh, so we decided to dine outside on the patio, but the inside looked pretty cool as well.  There looked to be a room off the main area for a group dinner party.  The food was on point.  We started off with fries and an order of \"Devils on Horseback\".  I can't really give a great explanation of what the latter is, but it involves bacon-wrapped dates, cheese, and I believe olives.  It made me think \"high-end stoner food\".  I hope that helps.   For entree, my wife got the papparedelle bolognese and I got the special, which was a flank steak with a fried egg, béarnaise sauce and a short rib hash.  My dish was delicious.... a bit on the salty side, but very good.  The pasta was very good as well.  We stuck with wine for our dinner, but the drink menu had a wide variety of cocktails.  If that's your thing, I'm sure you'll find something worth trying.  The service was just okay.  I think our waitress was a bad shift or two away from throwing her apron away.... or maybe she just had a really long night.     Recommend!"}
{"text":"It lives up to its reputation of being an amazing brunch spot; spent a cool morning there recently, and loved it! I enjoyed their version of a grilled cheese which included an amazing pickled green tomato not to be out shined by stellar bacon! The Bloody Mary bar was a hit but I chose to enjoy a lavender bubbly drink that was delicate but sweet! The only minor suggestion I may make would be for the front of house staff to not so obviously walk through so frequently to check the status of your meal to determine their wait time, it made us feel rushed or judged. However, the food, drinks and waitstaff was on point and I have no complaints! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Last night, we took my boyfriend's family to Meat and Potatoes.  The food was amazing (which I discuss below), but first I wanted to mention how well we were treated.  We had a reservation for 6 people.  Due to some folks lingering at their table and other issues, we weren't seated until about 30 minutes after the time of our reservation.  Instead of simply leaving us at the bar, the owner came over twice to apologize and comp us a round of drinks and two flatbread appetizers.  That level of attention and care for customers is unique, and our group was still talking this morning about how well we were treated.     Apart from the excellent service, the food was delicious.  We had the bone marrow, tartar and pate appetizers, all of which were great.  The boys had the chicken pot pie, meatloaf and sweetbreads for dinner. These were big hits.  The girls had the steak tacos and the soft shell tacos for dinner, all of which were also very good.  Overall, we had a great experience and will definitely return."}
{"text":"This place was very crowded, they fit me in at the bar and had some good items from the menu.  I did not have it, but the big rib bone of meat that was served to many people looked interesting, I was waiting for Fred Flintstones car to flip on its side it was so big.  Make sure you get a reservation."}
{"text":"Still trying to give Pittsburgh a try but continuously disappointed. Yes, I am from Pgh. We need to send some of these restaurant managers to other 'major' cities to see how it's done. Just got back from southern Cali. Every establishment there is exceptional / they want ur business! and NICE!  Overall, another pig with lipstick. Staff rude Food is ok. Maybe the best u will see here in the burgh!  BAM!"}
{"text":"Great food. It's a tight squeeze and I feel like I'm eating with the people next to me, but the food is good enough that I have gone back and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"Loved the food and drinks.  Very unique.  Large portions.  Cook spot before or after a show."}
{"text":"I'm in Pittsburgh working at the PCLO and I've been to Meat & Potatoes, Butcher In The Rye & Pork & Beans. The food is top notch and the service has been excellent. Tonight I had dinner at the bar at Meat & Potatoes and asked for mayo & mustard for my burger. When I got my check I was charged a dollar for truffle mayo. I didn't ask for truffle mayo. When I mentioned it to the server he shrugged his shoulders. It's only a dollar, but I was disappointed with the lack of clarity. If you're going to charge me for mayo. Let me know so I can decide if I really want it. I'm in the industry and still over tipped. But I wanted to stiff him because of his reaction. I thought about talking to the manager, but again... it's only a buck. Still.. it's bad form. Is this your policy?"}
{"text":"The best fried chicken I ever had! We've eaten at their sister restaurant, The Butcher and the Rye, several times. We were in Pittsburgh and had the opportunity to have lunch at Meat & Potatoes before a six hour drive. Everything we ordered was delicious. The fried chicken with biscuits was amazing! Crunchy, well seasoned and juicy - the fried chicken was everything that fried chicken should be. We did not try any cocktails because of the drive."}
{"text":"Had the Yukon Potatoes to start, pork belly pastrami had me. Then the porterhouse with bone marrow butter, fantastic.  Had the dessert sampler best of all."}
{"text":"A disappointing recent visit to what has otherwise been a solid restaurant, all due to a poor service experience.   We arrive late on a Thursday, after most shows downtown had started, so the restaurant was not crowded.   We sat at the bar, which is usually a great experience, but today, the 3 bartenders didn't feel like making eye contact or being even nominally friendly much less serving.  No one greeted us when we sat down, and it took forever for someone to take our order.  The drinks were wonderfully prepared, as usual, and the food was solid.  However, they forgot part of our order (seems to be a theme if you look at other reviews), and the staff just seemed to be uninterested in being there or dealing with customers.    Guests near us seemed to be having the same experience -- surly bartenders, distracted staff.  Would have been a 4, but service has got to improve."}
{"text":"The first of many Rick DeShantz restaurants that are consistently the best restaurants in the city.  M&P is on a short list of *must* try restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"Got the croque madam for brunch, which was a 3 star at best. Hostesses were playing Pokemon Go upon our arrival but our waitress was very friendly and the food came out extremely fast."}
{"text":"Outstanding meal with outstanding service.  Exceeded my expectations.  The Bone Marrow was incredible.  Wonderful atmosphere and professional wait staff make this a must when you  are dining out in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"It wasn't really possible for me to be more excited about M&P when I'd heard about it.  Ambitious menu, attractive space and branding, serious cocktails...you name it, M&P seemed to be doing it right.  The primary problem is I just don't think the food is good enough.    It's not that it flat-out, irredeemably sucks (when you use quality ingredients there are sure to be some good flavors there), it's that 1) foods that are shamelessly unhealthy really have to be off-the-charts tasty or it's not worth it; and 2) it's not cheap for Pittsburgh. Case in point: the fried brussels sprouts somehow lacked any semblance of crispiness.  If I'm looking for soggy and greasy any local dive will do.        Unfortunately the service was also brutal when we went.  We ordered a starter for the table that somehow came after the dinner was entirely over, and the waiter disappeared for long stretches for reasons unknown.  This wasn't during the opening days either.  At this price point I can't imagine winning many diners' loyalty with the level of service.  I'm happy that places are taking on ambitious menu offerings. Perhaps M&P can evolve into a really good place, I hope it does. But until then I'd rather go to Primanti's."}
{"text":"This is a review for brunch. I have never been for dinner or drinks, and probably won't. We took our friend to Meat and Potatoes for a birthday brunch and were less than impressed with the brunch. First, they do not have a milk frother and only offer coffee. That would be ok IF they had black tea (which they do not, or did not, the weekend we went, which is absurd to not have on hand--go to the CVS across the street and get some when you run out). So coffee or bust which seems awfully strange for a \"top\" brunch place in Pittsburgh. The lack of tea or a latte definitely ruined my brunch. The food was meh. I ordered a regular eggs/bacon/homefries and it came out cold. The others ordered the fried chicken friend pork and it was a \"big pile of blah\" (direct quote from the eater). The bloody mary bar was like something in a college bar. Not worth it. It was very expensive and very busy, so the service was poor as well. We kept having to flag down a waiter to get service. Should have gone to the neighbourhood greasy spoon."}
{"text":"So good had to go there again!  Any beef eater will be wowed - get the bone marrow, just incredible, brought one home for our Siberian Husky and she was one happy gal!"}
{"text":"I've been to Meat and Potatoes three times over the last few months, with the most recent time being about two weeks ago, and the summary message is this: I've been unhappy with my last couple meals.  First time Dinner: Appetizers were great --- unique and tasty. Drinks were great.  My wife and I shared the awesome 34oz Ribeye for two. This ribeye is served with a 1ft bone protruding from the edge of the cutting board style serving platter.  It came with huge steak fries and their bone butter (bone marrow and butter, spices, basically)  We could not have been happier with our meal.  Service was great.  This led to me trying them for lunch.  Lunch: I had the soft-shell-crab sandwich.  While I knew I was being somewhat adventurous ordering this, I was completely turned off by the texture of the crab. I ate less than half of it and threw it away.  Bad experience.  I chalked this one up to bad menu selection.  (I did notice, however, that this item has been removed from the lunch menu.  I wonder why?!)  Second Dinner:  This time, a different couple joined us for dinner before \"Holiday Pops\" across the street at Heinz Hall.  This time I ordered the Roasted Branzino, which is basically European seabass.  While the presentation was very impressive with basically the whole fish served in a skillet with potatoes, capers, tomatoes, fennel, and artichokes there were problems with the execution.  They remove the bones by slicing the top of the fish and removing what they can through the top.  Long story short -- there were still plenty of bones in my fish.  Next, the fish was relatively small and hardly made a dinner meal for a big guy like myself.  The taste was ok, but playing around with pulling bones out of my mouth (with company) is not an experience I look forward to.  All four of us were underwhelmed with our meals and there are plenty of other alternatives that do a better job.  My overall impression is that service is generally good, and the cocktails served are inventive, fresh, clean, and tasty!  The food, however, seems to be style over substance and I'm just not happy at the end of the day!"}
{"text":"Meat and potatoes is a classic Pittsburgh restaurant. The place is full on a Monday night. Great people, friends, friendly staff. The drinks are retro 40ish . The vibe is friendly and the food is rustic and great!"}
{"text":"Meat & Potatoes... I can think of few places that I truly, truly want to enjoy more!  It's a cool place, with a great patio, and awesome food.  BUT TERRIBLE SERVICE!! Having gone several times and even having waited over a year to go back, we continue to leave disappointed.  Especially when management doesn't seem to care enough to respond to feedback...  Maybe if I wait another year or try the new place they're opening I'll find what I'm looking for."}
{"text":"Was hyped up after eating at sister place (Butcher in the Rye). Drinks were good, food wasn't bad but was not expecting apps to be served in chachy paper carnival French fry bowls. Ambiance, drinks, food, overall experience better at Butcher"}
{"text":"After wanting to try meat and potatoes for a long time my husband and I finally made it!  The restaurant while small is very nicely decorated and while the tables are close together that does not bother me.  We got the wedge salad and split it- it was very large and very tasty!  We also ordered the meat & potatoes for 2.  It was a Tomahawk ribeye.  While it was very tasty it had quite a bit of fat and didn't have as much flavor as I was expecting.  I saw quite a few other dishes going out that looked fantastic so i will be sure to try one of those the next time!"}
{"text":"We have been going since 2013 and this was the worst experience I have ever had. I had proof that my reservation was at 7:30 and the hostess argued with me that is was not. Finally they agreed and we were seated. Then it took 20 mins to get our drinks. He did not ever ask if he we wanted another one despite being at our table a few times. I should never have to ask for another drink. The service was terrible. The best thing was the bus boys. Never going again which make me so sad!"}
{"text":"After two recent trips to M&P, one for brunch, one for dinner... I finally think they've turned the corner. I haven't always been the biggest advocate as I've had some awful experiences but kudos to you them as of late.  For as nauseating as the whole Edison bulb, overly hip architecture that has sprouted across Pittsburgh, it works well here. They bartenders are skilled, and the best part, they are actually pleasant. Which is more than I can say about a lot of similar establishments. We stuck with beer and some simple Old Fasions, but I was memorized watching them work as we were sitting at the bar.  Frankly, I could come here and just eat from the snacks menu, but we decided on some appetizers with the bone marrow and tartare. Both were exquisite, just the right amount, and made up for any past transgressions from previous visits.  For dinner, I had a plain Jane burger, and it was exactly what I was craving. Cooked medium rare and didn't even need condiments which I rarely find myself saying. Fries, were as expected, very good and presumably cooked in duck fat. Although that's just a guess on my part.  To date the only issue is getting a table or at least, getting reservations. I'm sure it's a stressful job judging by be need of 2-4 hostesses every night but they don't always handle things well. I arrived right around 5PM on a Friday and got two seats at the bar no problem. Amazingly, the place was fairly dead until 6PM.  Confusing as we couldn't get reservations, but we were able to get in so it all worked out."}
{"text":"Good food and cocktails. Their bone marrow was good, but a bit too oily for me. We also ordered the fried chicken liver, which tasted fine,the pig's ears, which I didn't try but my friends like it.  For main, we had steak, salmon and duck. Salmon was really good, tender and fresh. It conbines well with the black rich . However, the sauce and the veggies were a bit salty for me.  The service and the atmosphere was great. A goos 4 star restaurant overall."}
{"text":"Brunch. Meat and Potatoes has officially raised the bar on what a brunch should be. This place FAR exceeded my expectations and then some. From the outside, the place looks a bit gimmicky, but trust me, once they've had their way with you, you will not regret coming.   We sat down in the busy place around 11am on a Saturday and only had to wait 15min for a table for 2. We asked the waitress if they had a bloody mary bar and she said something to the effect of- yeah, I'll bring you the alcohol you choose and then you can garnish your drink at the \"bloody mary bar\". THIS COULD NOT HAVE BEEN UNDERSOLD ANY MORE! What actually happens is they have 6 or so house made vodka or tequila infusions which are phenomenal! Old Bay vokda? sign me up! Garlic black pepper vodka? you can count me in! You take you glass and fill it to your satisfaction with delicious bloody mary mix, which contains just the right amount of kick, by the way. After this, you are greeted a bountiful assortment of spices, garnishes, vegetables, meats and anything else you can think of putting in your bloody. Everything from smoked weenies, to perfectly cooked shrimp to sinful bacon. Artichoke hearts, several varieties of olives, celery and pickles await as well. They give you the alcohol and bloody mix and the ice, YOU take your destiny from there. Oh, and did I mention you get this entire experience for only 7 dollars?!  We saw after making these heavenly concoctions that we were going to have full bellies so we ordered only one main breakfast dish between the two of us. Chicken and jalapeno cheddar waffles, the menu read. What it actually should say is \"Deliciously moist cheddar waffles with satisfying kick of jalapeno with a WHOLE CHICKEN on top served with too-good-to-be-true bourbon bacon maple syrup.\" I was speechless when the dish arrived as past experiences at other brunching locations served me with a mediocre waffle with two measly strips of chicken on top. This was no ordinary chicken and waffles and I now don't think I can ever order this dish at another restaurant and feel satisfied knowing what's really out here.   Our experience at Meat and Potatoes showed me what brunch can and should be. I salute you, M&P for giving me what I think may actually be the best brunch experience of my life."}

{"text":"\"So if she's ordering whiskey you can assume she's clearly comfortable with herself, knows what she wants and has no problem making it happen - regardless of what anyone else at the bar might think.\" - Elite Daily, 10 Reasons Why You Should Always God For The Girl Who Drinks Whiskey   When I moved to a new city and realized that some of my social interests were different than many of my fellow college graduates, I found myself exploring restaurants and bars in downtown, because that's where I wanted to be: in the city. I was first introduced to Meat & Potatoes (M&P) in Pittsburgh's Theatre Square, by a colleague. Several weeks later, I found myself going back, by myself. There is a weird stigma about women going to bars alone but if you know what you like (drink wise and environment wise) then, go for it! I love going out alone to enjoy a drink or meal alone. M&P is the perfect location and environment for such a night. Why? Because it lays somewhere near casual fine dining and brings the working professionals and artsy culture of Pittsburgh together, under one roof. It's a place where I know I will get great service, a stellar Manhattan (I like mine with Blanton's and 2 cherries) and a great seat for people-watching across their large but cozy bar. I've been to M&P so many times now that the bartenders know me by name - whether that is a good thing or not, is up to you. I've enjoyed an hour or more to myself at M&P but, I have also had some fantastic conversations late into the night with those visiting Pittsburgh or locals who also love this spot.  If you are looking for dinner, make a reservation and you will be in store for a whirl! M&P's dinner menu is home to a variety of quality cuts of meat and fish but their mushroom risotto and sprouts are drool-worthy as well. Their weekend brunch and bloody mary bar is one of the best in Pittsburgh but be sure to make a reservation or you won't get a seat!   I went through this phase where I would be craving a great bar environment and I would want to try a new place in town. I am all for trying new spots but, there is a certain time in the night where you simply shouldn't fix what's not broken. Don't walk across the city if what you love is standing in front of you. On a late night's I have gotten into the habit of ordering fernet and coke at the bar, along with their signature espresso panna cotta. Yummy!  Get a group of friends or co-workers together, or venture out alone for a great time and drink at Meat and Potatoes. And, don't forget the whiskey. Pittsburgh is a Meat and Potatoes kind of town, and M&P is where you want to be if you are a downtown dweller or visitor!  - xoxo, A  (A California Girl Living in Pittsburgh on Purpose)"}
{"text":"I really wish I could give this restaurant more than 5 stars. My wife and I travel an hour and a half a few times every year just to eat here. It is definitely geared towards food savvy customers. With food coming on half sheet trays, and kitchen towels for napkins it makes restaurant employees from anywhere feel right at home. The servers and bar staff all seem to enjoy their jobs and take pride in everything they bring to the table.      First was the alcohol- They have an excellent list of spirits including many prohibition cocktails, which in my experience have all been delicious. I'm a bourbon drinker, and anytime I find buffalo trace on a menu it's a sign of good things to come. Their barrel aged manhattan was sweet and smooth, and had exactly the right amount of bitters and an imported cherry to boot.      Getting appetizers is far and away my favorite part about coming here. The chicken livers are out of this world, and I always get an order of bone marrow. I've never had anything here that was anything short of fantastic, but if I were to make a recommendation for an entree I would totally suggest getting into what ever offal parts they have on the menu, or any form braised meat ( shank or short rib).     Always remember to save room for dessert. I am not normally a fan of dessert or sweet things in general, but I always save room for that last course here. On our most recent visit I tried tiramisu which was one of the best I've ever had, but the toffee cake was to die for. It was served warm with a side of house-made whipped cream and pomegranate seeds, and I would have ordered a second one had I not been full to the point of bursting. All around great place, with refined drinks, fantastic appetizers, delicious meals, amazing desserts, and the most comfy chairs you could ask for. 10/10 Joe Macklin PS. To all the jag-offs out there who are complaining about things like being told you cant have more people than you made your reservation for, please stop going to restaurants all you do is cause headaches, and no one wants your business. Also to those who hated everything they tried, it is not the fault of the restaurant if you have poor taste."}
{"text":"Had the flat iron steak and it was soooo delicious! The atmosphere was nice but make sure you make a reservation before showing up because they had no seats available. I squeezed myself into the bar. The staff looks like they mix great drinks but I didn't try them.  The food was great, had a potato pancake with pulled pork as well. That was great! I definitely want to go back before I leave Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Everything here is delicious. Seriously, I mean EVERYTHING! You WILL need a reservation so don't think you will just be able to walk in and get a table. But when a place is this good what do you expect?!? Get the devils on horseback as an appetizer, you will thank me later! Also, if you are a fan of fried pickles they are some of the best in Pittsburgh. I have never had a bad meal at meat and potatoes and have have eaten here way too many times to review all of my meal choices. The specials are always top notch and you cant really go wrong by ordering one. Just go with the fried pickles and devils on horseback as an app then order anything off the menu for a great dining experience! A+ (it's really dark here so bring a flashlight to read the menu)"}
{"text":"Their Brunch is banging! and the Bloody Mary Bar is out of this world!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness!  This place was amazing.  Everything we ordered was fantastic!  I highly recommend the Brussel sprouts,  the goat cheese & bread,  as well as the pork sandwich."}
{"text":"I ate here right after attending a play next door at the O'Reilly Theater. After learning that nearby restaurants closed early due to water issues, we quickly noticed that they were still open and decided to partake. We were welcomed and guaranteed a spot without reservation (points added for that)! The waitress was very pleasant and friendly. We ordered our drinks and browsed the extensive menu full of gastropub favorites! I had to order the mac n cheese! So yummy! I also ordered the wings and they were also very tasty!   I can't wait to dine here again and try their brisket. Definitely 5+ stars!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious and beautiful and full of mirrors! I love the cocktails. I've never had the food, but it always looks amazing."}
{"text":"Food was excellent! Had a late reservation,  was my fault waited to long to make them and it was for a Friday night, lots of shows in Pittsburgh that night.  I would recommend the bone marrow so worth the price! It was our 33rd anniversary,  enjoyed the food very much. I had the salmon with kimchi and black rice, the salmon was cooked perfect, very moist! The hubby got the pork chop with beans and greens, very flavorful,  and such big portion! Was a younger crowd this night, and only draw back was the tables very close, so heard other conversations. But we did enjoy ourselves!"}
{"text":"The restaurant has a very trendy feel to it-even on a Sunday evening the place is buzzing with hip, young foodies, and it has a great atmosphere.   We started with the bone marrow appetizer. It was actually my first time trying bone marrow, and after tasting it, I don't know how I've ever gone without it. It was presented very nicely, and I loved that they had a few different kinds of accompaniments to give it different flavors. I think we had capers, sea salt, pickled red onions, and some sort of gremolata. I loved the sea salt and bone marrow combination.   For our meals, we got the pappardelle pasta and the mushroom flatbread and shared. The pappardelle was good, and had some great chunks of meat in there, but it was served with garlic bread that I honestly felt just detracted from the rest of the dish. The mushroom flatbread was tasty too, although nothing that made it extraordinary.   Overall, the place had a great atmosphere, bone marrow to die for, and some solid entrees. Would be back if I'm ever in the Pittsburgh area!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and my first experience was the best! Typically, you should make a reservation before coming here because it gets filled up pretty quickly. I love coming to this restaurant because they provide a good dining experience. The service is great and the ambiance of the restaurant is wonderful as well. It has a hipster, rustic, and natural feel to it. The low lighting adds to it as well.   I was excited to order the bone marrow because we have never had it before. I have always been hesitant to try it but I am glad I ordered it from Meat & Potatoes. These huge pieces of bone marrow come out piping hot and it is served with grilled bread. It is paired with 3 toppings which consists of picked onions, capers, and sea salt. You spread the bone marrow on the bread and place your desired toppings on it and voila, a creamy and divine appetizer is ready! The initial bite will make your taste buds happy, happy, happy! It is so creamy and buttery! The pickled onions provide a nice crunch and tangy flavor to the buttery taste of the bone marrow. I highly recommend ordering this if you are up to being adventurous!   We also ordered the Short Rib Papperdelle, flatbread pizza, and Truffle Mac and Cheese. My favorite thing was by far the Short Rib Papperdelle. The creamy tomato sauce is perfect and the short rib was melt in your mouth. The papperdelle soaks up all of the sauce and tastes incredible! You could probably pass on the flatbread pizza because it wasn't that fantastic. I think they serve the truffle mac and cheese once in awhile because we did not see it on our second visit there. The truffle mac and cheese was phenomenal! It was cheesy and the flavor was heightened by the incredibly taste of truffles!   There are also plenty of cocktails that you can select from on their menu. The bar is gorgeous and you could also dine there as well. I would highly recommend coming here if you are in the downtown area of Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"What a great restaurant! My husband and I shared the mushroom flatbread with truffles, ricotta, and arugula. I then ordered the pasta bolognese (incredible!) and he had the sweetbread piccatta. The pasta was full of flavor and very filling, and the sweetbreads were tender and cooked perfectly.  We also enjoyed their interesting cocktail (I tried the aperol-ade, a very refreshing drink.) The atmosphere is cozy, although maybe a bit loud and crowded. I would suggest going late, on a week night, and make sure to make a reservation.  I'm so excited to go back and try something new on the menu--everything sounds so delicious!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with my husband and friends of ours around 9:30pm because it was the only reservation we could land on a Saturday when looking 2 days before.   When we were seated it probably took 10 minutes before our waiter came to greet us and get us some water - and we were parched from being out on a humid day. So that wasn't a great start to our experience.   We ordered their fried taters, bone marrow, corn dog, pork belly tacos, mushroom risotto and the lamb leg. Their fried taters were well seasoned and went well with the black truffle mayo. It was my first time eating  bone marrow this way and it was very oily but I think it's naturally that way so overall it was good when eaten with the other condiments it came with. The corn dog wasn't anything special but the sauce gave it a little kick. The mushroom risotto was delicious and was probably the best dish of the night. The lamb leg dish was okay and probably wouldn't be something I would order again from here. It was very oily and a bit salty. I didn't try the tacos but the person who ate them said it may have been the best they have had. The pork belly was crispy that it melted in his mouth.   When we were done with dinner, it took a good 15-20 minutes before we were waited on again for leftover boxes, check, etc. Overall our waiter didn't check on us enough and wasn't very friendly. So in a nutshell, the food can be a hit or miss - and I would stick to popular dishes for the hit - and the service has a lot of room for improvement."}
{"text":"the most decadent meal i have had in years. great for very special occasions, but also passes as a casual tuesday night on mad men. cool speak-easy vibes. highly recommend the duck, its practically like steak!"}
{"text":"Visiting from LA and took my bf here for a belated bday dinner (he is from here). The food was great! We had the artisan board, we we both agreed was probably one of the best ones we've had, and that is something we usually get other places. We also got the duck pate and the wagyu steak. Let me tell you ... The steak was cooked perfectly! I would highly recommend that. We also had a bottle of the Malbec wine and that was delicious. The service was great, Emily our waitress, was super nice and attentive. All in all great place great food. Just wish their dinning tables were bigger considering how big the dishes are."}
{"text":"Meat & Potatoes is one of my favorite Pittsburgh restaurants. It's exciting to see more restaurants like this opening up around the city. It's quite the hipster scene, but the atmosphere is excellent so is the decor.   I've never had a bad meal or experience here. The duck liver pate is usually something I always order. I expected it to be gamey at first, but to my pleasant surprise it was not. The are mussel are great though I've only tried their curry variation. Pro tip - ask for extra toast/bread for the pate & mussels when you get it since they toast them to order. The duck I've had only once but it was well cooked and the texture was perfect. The devils on horseback were a bit too sweet for my taste so I did not care for them much. I'm still working my way through the whole menu, but I haven't had a true complaint about any of their dishes yet.    I've had a few and they're all exceptional, but the Southie is by far one favorite cocktails here. The bartenders do what they do well and they're all very friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"If you're in Pittsburgh and looking for Spme good filling food, this is where it's at! Not to mention they have a \"Bloody Mary\"(for those Americans) or us Canadians like to call it, \"Caesars\" bar with all the right fixings!   This place is awesome if you want to come before a theatre show as it's connected to one of the major theatres. Be sure to make reservations though because it gets packed!  My fiancé and I came for brunch and we are sad that we weren't able to go back for dinner because the brunch was more than satisfying and worth our every penny!   The fiance ordered the pub burger and I ordered the classic chicken and waffles. Let's start with the burger, it had a beautifully cooked fried egg to top and some yummy horseradish flavoured sauce that gave it the right zing! Of course it came with some shoe string fries on the side. Right size and good flavour, not your average burger!  My chicken and waffles was an absolute delight, my mouth waters just describing it. Firstly it was ginormous, I'm sort of embarrassed yet proud to say that I finished the whole darn thing. The chicken batter was light and crispy and the meat inside literally melted in my mouth, it was so juicy! The waffle the chicken sat on was any average eggo type waffle you find at the grocery store. This one was homemade and infused with jalapeños. It didn't stop here, my chicken and waffles came with bourbon maple bacon infused syrup that tied all of the loveliness together in one bite...  To no surprise we had no room for dessert as our second stomach failed us!   Another awesome thing about this place that I mentioned briefly before is the make your own Caesar station! You pick your alcohol base (I chose siracha tequila- yes it exists!) and you basically walk up to the bar area where they have all the garnishes you could ever think of for a Caesar, from bacon to celery to green beans to prosciutto to cabbage rolls! And there is no limit!   If I'm ever in Pittsburgh again I'll be sure to stop by here again, you should do the same!"}
{"text":"Amazing place. Order a Sticky bun to start , you won't regret it.   Chicken and waffles and eggs were some of the best I've ever had !"}
{"text":"I was actually REALLY surprised by this place. I always assumed it was going to be really expensive and nothing but red and fatty meats. I was really surprised at the fair prices for the quality of food. I'm not downtown much but plan on going back"}
{"text":"Chicken and waffles upscale....bloody Mary bar unique with scrumptious add ins...take a a lovely walk afterwards and enjoy the scene!!!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a long time. Overall, it was great. My only complaint is that they use too much salt! Brussel sprouts are my favorite, but their fried Brussel sprouts were way too salty even for my friend who loves salt. The flavor was wonderful, but could not eat a lot due to the salt. I had the flat iron steak for my entrée. Very tasty and tender, but chewier than a fillet. I asked them to go easy on the salt on this which they did! However, the potatoes, mushrooms were again over salted. My husband had the pasta Pappardelle. I have had this at other places and enjoyed it more. He had the same reaction. It was good, but not fantastic. Another friend had the pot roast. He was disappointed with the size and said it was not warm enough. I would recommend it to friends. Service was great. Everyone should try it once and make up their own mind. I would go back again."}
{"text":"Was just here over the weekend for a late night snack. Food is yummy!"}
{"text":"If you want IMPECCABLE service, GREAT wait staff, and AMAZING food....DON'T COME HERE.  Where do I begin to even comprehend to you the ATROCIOUS customer service this place has....not only were the people SARCASTIC but they have no idea what the proper etiquette is for greeting and welcoming people. YOU SAY HELLO NOT WAIT FOR US TO SAY HI CAN I HAVE A TABLE....OBVIOUSLY we were here to eat and not just stare at you while we WAIT for you to notice us...even though we WERE THE ONLY people in front of you. We had a friend waiting for us and he had stated that he was outside, well I informed the hostess since I didnt want to be rude and just walk in, that we were here to sit outside since a friend already had a table for us. Well, she pointed at the door and stated \" its that way\", then turned back to whatever she was doing....ok.....so we head out sit ourselves down.   With a name like Meat and Potatoes you would think MEAT and Potatoes would be the highlight...but nothing really AMAZING caught my eye in regards to that. I ordered steak BLUE along with some type of potato ( mashed) The plate LOOKED pretty but lacked flavor only salt. The apparent \"bed of brussel sprouts\" was just (I am guess 2 AT MOST). The waitress was no where to be seen, we even had to waive down another server for refills on drinks. Only other time she actually came was to give us the check....Note to servers, if you have people seated outside, check on them. When we wanted to pay, we waited an additional fifteen minutes until we GAVE UP and walked inside to pay....ONLY TO BE TOLD TO SIT DOWN AND OUR WAITRESS WAS GOING TO ASSIST US....Well GEE, if she showed up more than TWICE in our whole evening then maybe... JUST maybe we would have, but that was not the case.    I then went inside to buy some shirts and when I informed the woman at the front that I wanted to buy shirts she snickered at me and said,\" I have to go get the manager because I dont have the key for that\" Ok, no problem....got my shirts and left....  I have had bad service, but honestly this place gives Pittsburgh a bad reputation, this is not a restaurant you would want to visit if you are looking for quality food, great service and a memorable experience.  Go ANYWHERE but here."}
{"text":"Wonderful brunch! Has a knack for being creative and serving tasty food with a nice presentation. Food is flavorful; loved the bloody mary bar, and at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"We visited Meat & Potatoes last Saturday for a pre-dinner drink.  Upon arrival at 5:30pm, the restaurant AND bar were packed.  After making a circle around the bar to find seats, we went out to the hostess station to ask about a table.  Unfortunately, Meat & Potatoes was completely booked for the evening.  We really wanted to try at least something while we were there, so we went back to the bar.  I sat down at the only empty seat while my fiancé stood next to me.    I asked the bartender (who looked amazing in the flannel shirt and cabby hat) for a drink suggestion.  Per my taste buds, he recommended the Vanilla Sky.  It tasted slightly tart with hints of anise and vanilla.  As a black licorice lover, I truly enjoyed this beverage!  My fiancé got the 21st Amendment Back in Black.  We both really enjoyed our drinks and plan on returning to Meat & Potatoes - on a night we have made reservations."}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere. Visiting family from out of town. Appetizers were delicious. Ordered the flat iron steak. Beautifully presented.  Disappointed in the steak, as it was grisly."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of noise, too close for comfort seating, or tables that are too small to comfortably have drinks and entrees on the table.  The menu is not for the faint hearted ... brains pig ears etc.    The huge pork chop is very good and  definitely enough to share as a full entree ... the waiter knew we wanted to share the pork chop and order other sides didn't offer to have the double pork chop de-boned and cut in half in the kitchen ... not one of my finest culinary moments trying to make into 2 portions (on the tiny table)  Do not go there if you have theater tickets ... we had 5:45 reservations and ran over to the Benedum for a 7:30 show ...   There are much quieter better restaurants in the theater district."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful time. Very elegant atmosphere to eat juice lamb, steak and Bone marrow! Hard to get a reservation time we wanted over yelp. But no problem getting it after calling them around 6 a day before. We will be back!"}
{"text":"It was very good, but coming from NY, still think Lugers is better.  We ordered the steak for two.  Was not aware that everything's a la cart, including the steak sauces.  One off my check list.  I would still go back if in Pittsburgh again."}
{"text":"I had the pub burger and my wife had the roasted chicken; best meal in a while according to my wife. The burger was pretty awesome as well!"}
{"text":"the food was excellent ive had brunch and dinner/salmon flatbread,briscut,fried chicken were fantastic for brunch/the salmon was really nice/ for dinner the steak tartare ,bone marrow, and flat iron steak had alot of flavor and were made perfect/loved it/the waitress for brunch couldnt of been more helpful and was very nice/our waiter for dinner was also excellent and he made sure some special requests we had happened/excellent service/the only complaint is with the front desk/the girls arent very friendly /they dont try to make you feel welcome/they are very rude when you are on the phone with them and rude when your greeted at the door/when ever i asked a question as well as other people that came in all they could say is no/there was no  effort made to be of help/after the front of the restaurant meat and potatoes is wonderful/girls at front desk need to work on their people skills"}
{"text":"We tried to eat here last year, but it was booked up.  Made a reservation when I got into town for the Steeler game.  It was fabulous!  The waiter was very knowledgeable and gave excellent service!  Food was fabulous!"}
{"text":"Went for the brunch. Ordered shrimp & grits and chicken & waffles. This is hands down the worst brunch we've ever had. The shrimp itself is pretty good, but whatever that white goo stuff beneath it is not. As for the chicken, it tastes worse than KFC or McDonald, and the waffle is boring to a fault. The weird thing is, I had dinner here before, which was a great experience. Bottom line: avoid brunch here at all cost."}
{"text":"Terrific meal and delicious cocktail.  Fun atmosphere!  I tried the bone marrow as I'd heard so much about it, but it wasn't my cup of tea.  Their presentation was good and our dinners were really tasty.  Quick, attentive service."}
{"text":"First visit; tries too hard and misses on basics..my wife and I had lunch and she had fish and chips, I had pork sandwich. too many salty chips...why is salt have to be used at such high quantities? sandwich was very messy ...do chefs ever to try and eat their meals with business attire on? Fish was average and also made mushier  by the cole slaw bed. a great fish and chips is balanced and crisp...the basics need to be fixed before the \"innovative gastromics\" can be appreciated. oh and way too expensive for what u get now."}
{"text":"Best brunch in town! Everything I have tried here is amazing and I LOVE the Bloody Mary Bar!"}
{"text":"I've been a handful of times over the past few years, and M&P never disappoints. From their outstanding Brunch offerings, particularly the finest Bloody Mary Bar I have ever come across, to their Burger and much discussed, unreal bone marrow appetizer, make this spot that is generally recognized as one of the best in PGH well deserved."}
{"text":"Make your reservation well in advance, or stop in for a weekday lunch! Everything on the menu that I've tried is thought out, crafted, and is true artistry, but in a wildly hearty meat and potatoes sort of way. Do yourself a favor and have a hot date night here; you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Took a chance on a Sunday morning and walked in. Seated at the bar within 5 minutes. Love the service and food. Recommend short rib hash and chicken with waffles. Make your own bloody Mary bar or enjoy Irish breakfast coffee with maple whip cream. Dj plays nice mix and although a little loud we could still hold a conversation. Highly recommended for an adults only morning."}
{"text":"Everyone was raving about the bone marrow so we ordered that first without even looking at the menu. It was definitely an experience but boy was it fatty! The texture was enough to gag at, and the taste did little to make up for it. I would not order this for an appetizer again, nor would I recommend eating lumps of fat on an empty stomach!  For my entree I got the flat iron steak. Most expensive entree on the menu and I knew why! It was delicious. The steak was a melt in your mouth experience and the wasabi potatoes and shittake mushrooms complimented it perfectly. Cheesecake for desert was a knock out also. Of course, we had to ask for extra berries and the manager obliged.   I wasnt absolutely amazed by meat and potatoes. It was a good restaurant and an experience to try, but the space was slightly crammed. 4 stars though bc good food and great service. I'd go back again to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh by far. Reservations are hard to come by and the staff could be more friendly."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Bit on the pricey side but you get what you pay for. We shared a bone marrow appetizer, not something I'd order, but I tried it, not bad, but then I don't know what to compare it to. Everyone in my party got something different, and we all shared. My parpadelle was excellent! The pork shoulder ragu was so tender, the sauce not heavy, the wide noodles just right. The strip steak (rare) and the duck were the highlights though. Ooooh, melt in your mouth!!! The lamb meatballs we're very different, Greek/Mediterranean flavors."}
{"text":"Make a reservation, if you don't they will put you in their \"secondary room\". Service is slow back there and you'll find yourself feeling like a second class citizen. Prices were a little high but for a \"fancy dinner\" prices were decent. Not a huge fan of the service, but food made up for it. Probably would go somewhere else to eat."}
{"text":"This place has been hit or miss for us. And don't order the special without asking for a price (that's a $55 mistake I've made). I really thought with the name Meat and Potatoes that the meat and potatoes would be better than they were."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch based on all the rave reviews here on Yelp, and were seated at the bar as we didn't have a reservation. The place was packed to capacity on a Thursday afternoon around 1PM. There was one bartender on duty who was also acting as our server. While cordial enough, she was obviously overwhelmed. After a while she took our orders, and we sat at the bar being bumped up against by fellow patrons and wait staff. After waiting almost 30 minutes for a sandwich and a salad, we ran out of time and asked the bartender to make our order to go. She assured us twice that it would be right out. Another 10 minutes later and the order finally came out. Overall the food was nothing to rave about, and certainly not worth having to wait 40 minutes for. No utensils were included and a side was missing. We certainly didn't get what all the hype was about."}
{"text":"I live in Louisiana, and all I can say is that this place could definitely hang with the top places in New Orleans. I had the fried pickles (best I've ever had), along with the wild boar sloppy joe w/ bbq chips. Everything was awesome. The true star of the show, however, was the grilled bread, which only cost $3! It came with an amazing butter and homemade strawberry jam and was absolutely perfect. My buddy had the fried chicken which came with biscuits and a coffee-bacon jam. He gave me a biscuit with the jam and it was off-the-charts good. This truly was one of the best lunches of my entire life. I'll definitely be back, the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"This place has been on my must-go-to list for a while now because of the reputation and the fact that steak is one of my favorite meals.  I had been traveling Asia for 3 weeks before coming here so I was craving some good red meat.  I came here on a Sunday and was seated pretty quickly.  I went straight for the wagyu flat iron, cooked rare.  Honestly, I was kinda underwhelmed.  Maybe my taste buds weren't adjusted back to the American palette yet but my steak was really salty.  It was very soft but I needed a few glasses of water to finish.  Overall, the place is really nice and I'd definitely give it another shot but it just wasn't worth the price on my first trip.  Wagyu flat iron: 7/10"}
{"text":"It's a surprisingly small space and despite a number of bar seats it still appears impossible to get one.  Make a reservation, don't count calories, and enjoy.  Artisan cocktails are outstanding, definitely the best I've had in Pittsburgh and they easily measure up against my home town of New Orleans.  The wine and beer lists are also very well chosen so just about everyone will be happy (other than my colleague who always orders Bud Light, which they don't carry here).  On the appetizer menu, poutine is fantastic (and this is coming from someone who worked in Montreal for a year) if you like the combination of fries, cheese curds & brown gravy.  The lobster spring roll was really good, and the tartare was also excellent - let's just say there are very few places that I would ever order tartare but this is one.  The Fall Salad is also great and the sashimi was fine but didn't blow me away.  In terms of main courses the signature 34 ounce ribeye (which most restaurants would call a \"Tomahawk\" or \"Cowboy\" cut) was shared by my table on my initial visit and I have to say the meat was cooked perfectly and had great flavor but overall it just had way too much fat.  Of course, the accompanying fries and bone marrow gratin were also good.  The surprise hit of the meal however was the pasta - great homemade papardelle with a perfect short rib bolognese sauce and very good agnolotti with a brown butter sauce and some veggies although the shape & size of the pasta wasn't typical for agnolotti.  The short rib flatbread was also very good and the only real miss on 2 visits so far was a mushroom flatbread that had a strange ricotta spread for the cheese and just didn't have much flavor.  Nothing is perfect but everything from the decor to the service to the food are done well at Meat & Potatoes and I'll definitley be back - assuming I can get a reservation."}
{"text":"Personally I think this restaurant is overrated.  The seats are all very close together and I had people bumping into me as they were trying to pass by my seat and the bar.  Also, since its always busy, its very loud.  The cocktails are very good, but expensive and small.  I had a good meal and the service was prompt, but I just don't know if this place is as good as everyone is making it out to be."}
{"text":"Tried this place for dinner earlier this week on a biz trip to Pittsburgh.  I did not realize it was in the theater district of the city, which makes the location busier and more commercial than I was expecting.  I was hoping for something with more of a neighborhood feel, which this place definitely does not have.  It's right in the middle of a touristy part of downtown, so keep this in mind if you're trying to eat before a performance at one of the nearby theaters.... waits for a table seemed to be high, even on a weeknight.  Having said that, I found a seat at the very busy bar (just after 7:00pm on a Tues night), and proceeded to order one of the house specialties, the smoked pork chop, with baked beans and spicy apple slaw on the side.  This was probably the best damned pork chop I've had in my life, and was about 3\" thick (two ribs worth of the loin)!  Very tender and flavorful.  My bartender/server warned me it wasn't the fastest item to come out of the kitchen, but it was not a long wait.  I had the summer salad before, which was just OK.  All of their beers are either served on tap or in cans, and they have a decent selection.  I finished off with their coconut flan, which was outstanding.  My bill was $56, with a nice tip.  Service was fairly quick considering how busy the place was, and very competent and friendly.  I would try it again, but probably with a reservation."}
{"text":"Stay away from the stuffed French toast.  They use county fair caramel and it turns hard as a rock while you eat.  Overpriced hipster joint.  Better places within walking distance."}
{"text":"This is a very busy place in the dinner/evening hours! I have visited on a few occasions, each time in the evening. Food is excellent with a great variety of things to choose from, and the dessert is amazing! It comes in cute glasses and it's a perfect portion size for one person. We have stopped post-CLO shows and had coffee on a couple of occasions as well. Always a good spot for coffee and dessert! The service was good, with the servers always attentive. The most challenging things about this location are its size and tight quarters. Tables are very close together and it can be difficult to not be sitting on top of other guests. The waiting area is also very limited. If you do not have a reservation, you will be waiting a while for a table due to lack of space inside, and there isn't much room to wait out in the lounge. I recommend checking it out with an advance reservation!"}
{"text":"This place is super cool and has an industrial warehouse look to it. The place is a little small but has a very cozy atmosphere to it. The food is good and the portions are large so beware. The bar is unique because it offers a bloody mary bar (a.k.a. Sunday afternoon joint) for you to make your own bloody mary cocktail. Kasey was my server on the Sunday that I visited and she was very attentive and did a great job on picking out my food selection. I had a burger with an egg on top served with sweet potato fries.  If you are looking for a great place to \"catch up\" or just have a simple yet filling lunch with a friend this is the place to be. I wouldn't recommend this place to families with young children, it's kind of an adult establishment. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Excellent. Great drinks. Amazing pub burger and chicken sandwich. Awesome service. Note: does not discount parking ticket as stated on open table. They were apologetic but didn't do anything for us with regards to parking."}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of the things I will truly miss about Pittsburgh. I have gone several times for brunch, everything is amazing. The korean brisket is one of the best briskets I've ever had. Bloody mary bar is a must! Only went once for dinner and it was spectacular. Order a specialty cocktail even if you normally don't. Cheesecake is always good. My only complaint is seating is very tight at the cafe tables inside."}
{"text":"First time to Pittsburgh and this place has me falling in love...along with the PPG building because that thing is beautiful and kickass.  I took my sales rep and sales engineer out for a team-building dinner to this place after seeing it on the Travel Channel.  It is a small place but we were seated at a nice table in the corner by the windows.  Our server was fairly attentive but not great.  My cocktails were good but not memorable.  To start, we had devils on horseback, poutine, and the kobe corndog.  My favorite was the corndog with the chipotle sauce - just divine meaty and spicy.  The fries in the poutine were crispy and soaked up the savory gravy well, with the curds squeaking properly against the teeth.  Devils on horseback needed some cheese or the bacon needs to be crispier because there was a slight texture issue while the flavour was robust.  The fried brussel sprouts were nicely charred and I snuck a pieces of chicharrone and crispy pig ear from the caesar salads.  The three of us also shared the 34 oz bone-in ribeye with mushrooms, steak fries, and bone marrow gratin.  I was a little disappointed that the ribeye was not medium-rare but more medium and the quality wasn't the best.  However, it was impressive looking and the steak fries were incredibly tasty, along with God's butter (aka bone marrow).  The dessert was a huge disappointment, as I ordered the salted caramel pretzel brownie.  It came out parfait-style but was so incredibly dry and the mouthfeel was similar to soft gravel.  I would not recommend ordering dessert here.  TL;DR - fun smallish gastropub requiring reservations that mostly has great food but service needs to perk up with more personality and dessert needs a major overhaul."}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving this restaurant 4 stars is because of the ambiance.  This place is LOUD and cramped but the food and service make up for it in spades.  The hostess did go the extra mile to get us at a full-sized table when asked to be moved - we were initially at a cocktail table much to our dismay.  Two large people at a small round table isn't very comfortable. We did get attitude from our server when we asked to be moved to a larger table.  But, again, the food more than made up for the bad attitude from the server.  My husband and I went there on Friday, February 13th for an anniversary dinner.  The wild mushroom risotto was amazing!  We both had the flat iron steak and it was cooked to perfection.  The charred carrot salad that the meat was served with was phenomenal.  For dessert, we had a malted chocolate potted cream that was pretty much heaven.  If you go, ask for a full-sized table when you make your reservations or you might find yourself at a small cocktail table.  Reservations are an absolute must - you won't get a table on a Friday night without one."}
{"text":"Delicious menu (for dinner and brunch), great drinks, excellent service. Make a reservation."}
{"text":"House - Had a wonderful dinner Monday, January 2, 2017, having 8:00 p.m. reservations. Pittsburgh was quiet after the New Year celebrations and so was Meat and Potatoes - several open tables and places at the bar, which sits in the center of the large dining room. The room is circled by half booths in velvet with heavy 2-person white marble top tables that were nice and sturdy. I have mobility issues and there were no steps to get into the restaurant and our table was near the entrance so I had a very easy time getting to the table. The cushioned booth side I was sitting on was quite low and I was afraid I'd have trouble getting up as my leg strength is the problem, but I was able to make it up fine. There was a large still water bottle with a bale top stopper that the hostess poured our water out of. The glasses are plain and heavily weighted. The water was not chilled, which I would have preferred.  Cocktails & Appetizers - Our server was Crystal, a wonderfully cheerful and polite young lady, who happily shared her best information and advice on drink and food choices. I had a Mexican Honey Bee which was strong but good, and my husband had a Dark and Stormy, which was quite too strong for me. We ordered fried pickles with spicy ranch and an order of the poutine. We did not care for the fried pickles appetizer and did not eat more than a bite - the pickles were not like dill flavored. They were very strong and overpowered the ranch and breading. The poutine was a new dish for both of us and it was absolutely delicious with a lovely gravy with melted cheese curds and scallions that really made the flavor pop.  Salad - I ordered the Cobb salad and it was a very large oval plate with iceburg carpaccio / bacon lardons / tomatoes / maytag blue cheese / egg / avocado ranch dressing. The carpaccio is only indicative of the fact that the iceburg is sliced into thin flat rounds. Probably won't be able to tell this since it's piled up with condiments. This was a lovely salad with delicious bacon lardons that I wish were more plentiful, but the blue cheese and avocado ranch dressing simply clashed in a very distasteful way. I'd definitely get this salad again but just leave off the ranch and ask for blue cheese only. I can recommend this salad based on that stipulation.  Entrees - After consulting with our server Crystal about the specials, I decided to go with my original idea of the Wagyu Flat Iron - smoked fingerling potatoes / celery root / maitaki / soubise / pecorino compound butter - and after reading another Yelp review, I asked to substitute Confit potatoes instead of the fingerling potatoes, but Crystal said it would not be possible based on how the dish is put together (everything coming combined underneath the steak). The steak was absolutely the most delicious steak I have had in YEARS. It reminds me of the grass-fed beef from my childhood. It was so worth the $38. I ended up just getting a side order of the confit potatoes and they were fantastic - crunchy on the outside while fluffy, soft and delicious on the inside. My husband got the Pappardelle - bolognese sauce / pancetta / pork shoulder / garlic bread - this was a delicious dish as well and very economical at just $18. The bolognese was almost like stew meat and very plentiful in the dish  with fewer but very large flat noodles. The garlic bread would have been much better had it been grilled. It was quite chewy but definitely not a deal breaker. My husband was very happy with this dish and would definitely order it again. One last note about the evening's specials, Crystal was very nice to guide me about the extremely small portion of Octopus (3 oz) special available, which definitely helped me greatly in my entree decision making.    Desserts - My husband ordered the apple cheesecake which was in a jar with crumble topping and he said it was delicious and not overly sweet, which was very pleasing to him and he would order it again. I ordered the Pot de Creme chocolate with whipped cream topping and caramel popcorn topping which was absolutely delicious together.  The bill came to just under $150 and we ended up taking virtually all the dishes home with the exception of the fried pickles, which Crystal had taken off our bill. This was a very nice gesture and was not expected at all as there was nothing wrong with the dish except just the taste to us was not pleasant. This was one of the best dinners we've had in quite a while and it just makes me want to return as soon as my wallet rebounds.  Decor/Environment - Five Stars Food - Five Stars Service - Five Stars  We hope your experience is as pleasant as ours was. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I have so many mixed feelings about meat & potatoes. The food is excellent. The decor is beautiful. The seating is the most comfortable ever. the tables along the right hand side are very intimate..if you want to get to know your table neighbs. The deals on Monday night are fabulous--$5 gourmet burgers, $3 fries and many other options. The brunch and Bloody Mary bar are to die for. But the music and ambience, the patrons... all make me very uncomfortable. I'd rather listen to dinner music than listen to a dj spin techno over breakfast or while having a late night meal."}
{"text":"Really unique food! Had the bone marrow, pig ears, and dates for starters. They were all awesome! The bone marrow was rich and I loved the addition of garnishes. The pig ears were crispy with a super balanced thai chili sauce (wish I had ordered beer to pair with that dish!). The dates with chorizo were paired with a super fresh tomato sauce. All the cocktails were really well balanced and not overly sweet. We shared the pappardelle for an entree. The noodles were perfectly al dente and the rich sauce was stick to your ribs good. This was definitely more of a winter dish, but it was a cool evening so it worked out. All the food was very good- not knock my socks off, but definitely above average!  The service was so-so. We got to the restaurant early for our 8pm reservation (7:45). Although there were many tables visually available, we still had to wait a little for a table. In fact, a family of four without reservations came in while we were waiting and were seated before us... Our waiter was nice, but not super attentive. It was at least 15 minutes before he even took our drink order.... And 20-25 minutes before we received our drinks. He didn't really check in on us... Overall, I expect more when a meal is in this price point. The bus staff, however, was super attentive and great!   So overall, above average and unique, but not life altering."}
{"text":"The food, cocktails and beer selection is great. Most of the stuff on the main courses are very good especially the pork dish and the huge ribeye they have. I took one star off as they tend to lose orders in the kitchen on a frequent basis. Great lively atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've heard nothing but great things about this place and I was so excited to go.  I think I even made up a song about how excited I was to go.  Once I got there I was not disappointed.  The decor wasn't quite what I expected, but not bad.  The food was great.  We started with the kobe corn dog and fried brussel sprouts.  The corn dog wasn't really better than the best corn dog I've had before in my life but the fried brussel sprouts were something new and delicious.  They were crispy on the outside but still juicy on the inside.  My boyfriend got the pot roast and I got he pastrami crusted duck.  His pot roast was good, but I had to protect my duck from him after he tried a bite.  I have never tasted anything like it.  The combination of flavors made you keep searching for more.  It was rich without being too rich and the saurkraut pierogis that came with it was a great balance to the duck.  I highly reccomend this place to anyone who enjoys classic food in a way that you've never experienced it before.  I ordered some of their specialty drinks, two that were gin based.  I can't recall their names now but they were not my favorite thing on the menu.  Dessert was a \"pot de creme\" which was the perfect amount of sweetness after my meal."}
{"text":"Every other review will rave about the amazing bone marrow and extensive Bloody Mary bar -- I will agree, wholeheartedly.   HOWEVER, regarding the hostess(es):  Don't expect the hostesses to be accommodating or helpful when trying to make same-day call-ahead reservations.   I understand that such a successful establishment is not hurting for business, but the hostesses were rude and pretentious when simply asked about seating a party of 6. \"We can't accommodate a party that large.\" Done. No further explanation, no attempt to resolve.   Um, ok? I'm a very patient person. \"So then what do you recommend for a larger party (which I don't consider a party of 6 as \"large\" but I suppose it is a smaller restaurant)... \"There are some other restaurants nearby.\" ---- WHAT? I'm sure management would love to hear how well-trained they are to handle *difficult* questions/situations from the hangry brunch crowd.   Fortunately we were able to make a reservation for 4 (two of our party decided it was not worth the hassle) through the app. Clearly I was hell-bent on dining at this establishment.  Final conclusions:  1) Make reservations far in advance. Fortunately you can do that through the Yelp! App.  2) If you plan to walk in and wait, you better not have over 4 people in your party. If so, just take your business elsewhere because they so obviously do not need yours. In fact, they'll gladly share with others.  3) While hostess service left a bad taste, every other aspect was worth the wait-time. Polite, knowledgable and attentive servers. Delicious food."}
{"text":"Best brunch I've ever had!  Great Bloody Mary bar, food unique and delicious! The best!  Worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Had an enjoyable lunch here, with mostly positives.  I love the decor of the place walking in. The set up is interesting - oval shaped room with couches lining the edge. It feels really quaint without feeling stuffy. Huge bar in the middle.  We tried the fried \"taters\" which were truffle fries, and the devils on horseback, basically chorizo stuffed dates. The fries were great! A very generous portion for $5 and came with yummy truffle mayo. The dates however... the only thing I could taste was the dates, which overpowered the chorizo and the sauce and I would not order it again.  For entrees we got pappardelle and duck and both tried a bit of each. The duck was good overall and I did enjoy it, but the chimichurri really overpowered it, and I love love love the natural flavor of duck that was definitely not highlighted :( The pappardelle (why is this word so hard to say) tasted really really undercooked to me, but my friend refused to send it back...  Personally I liked the sauce, but the dish does taste kind of heavy to me, but I am someone who generally finds pasta dishes a bit heavy. For dessert, we split a vanilla creme brulee, and it was just average. Really really sweet, actually, so that can be good or bad depending on preferences. Acceptable.  I'd definitely come here again and try some other things on their menu. Good experience overall. It's so conveniently located right in the heart of the cultural district - no doubt lots of concert/playgoers take advantage of this."}
{"text":"Always a good choice. Must try the bone marrow. While their steaks are good, I recommend trying some of their other menu items as well- it's all excellent. Good service, great food, Pittsburgh staple."}
{"text":"It seems like everyone in Pittsburgh is ranting and raving about Meat and Potatoes. I have half a mind to join them. However I feel like M&P is like that girl you pick up at 2 AM when the boozer is letting out. Things look great right then and there but looming back the next morning you are left thinking \"Weren't you prettier last night?\" This is my morning after wake up call.   We will start with the decor.  I like it. It's a cool modern take on the kind of look one gets in a classic pub. While this should lend to a warm inviting atmosphere, M&P is somehow able to make is feel cold and pretentious. Secondly, the tables are crammed in so tight big guys like me can end up feeling very cramped. On that note I would like to apologize to the poor people seated next to me on my last visit. The layout forced my butt in your dinner. Sorry.   The service can mirror the feel from time to time. Sometimes I get warm and friendly, other times its cold and unapproachable. Just because you work in a hot downtown location doesn't me you get to be a boor to your guests.   The major saving graces to M&P are the food and the cocktails. The food is killer. My go to favorites are the fried chicken livers (trust me) and the signature Meat and Potatoes for Two (I don't share. Fat guy remember?). Steaks always come out hot and perfectly cooked, but rested enough so they don't bleed out all over your plate. The bar is stellar too. They seem to trend toward updates on classic prohibition era cocktail is but they are done well. The drinks are very well balanced and tasty. Too easy to have too many tipples here.   To wrap up I like M&P. it's pricey but I the k it is worth it. The major issues I have with the place stems from their pretentiousness. They label themselves a \"gastropub\" which to me is entirely redundant. The word supposedly means a bar with great food. Ok you just described a \"pub\". The attitude follows with the decor and the attitude of the workers. It's like meeting this great girl at last call and in the morning you find out she is kinda bitchy. But she's definitely hot enough to call again."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the Root to Berry cocktail. It was well balanced and not too sweet. I'll have to come back and try the food!"}
{"text":"We came to town to watch baseball and celebrate my buddy's birthday. We had eaten here on our previous trip here 2 years ago and it didn't fail to impress. We ordered a few house cocktails and starters while deciding on our dinner. After struggling to decide on the amazing choices I settled on the pub burger. It was probably the best burger I've ever had. The beef was amazing, chuck/short rib/ brisket house ground. Very good!  Crystal,our waitress was great. I'm a sides kinda guy, she brought me a plate of all their house made pickled veggies. Delicious. We will,definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have been both for brunch and dinner and both were fantastic. This place is always packed so you know it is good and must make a reservation well in advance. On my last visit which was my first time having dinner here we all started with canned beer! Funny for a more fancy place but they do not have a lot of drafts. Those in my party started with the muscles and had a few sauces to choose from. They went with a beer bacon sauce that you could not go wrong with. My only complaint is they charged you for bread for dipping. For my entree I got the burger with cheese and asked to substitute mashed potatoes with fries. The burger bun was homemade and cooked to my liking. They brought out the fries instead of mashed potatoes but quickly fixed this and took it off our bill. Others in my party ordered the duck, hanger steak and pork and were very happy with their choices. Be warned the pork is a huge serving that comes with baked beans and collard greens."}
{"text":"Sunday Brunch... OUT OF THIS WORLD.  I had the French Toast.. topped with Almond Brittle, Banana and Bacon.. Best I've ever had in Pittsburgh !"}
{"text":"Lot of good things to say about M&P and a few less good too - so I'll do a pro and con, for a chance. But overall a very very good place downtown!  Pros: the restaurant is very nice, with a great oval bar at the center, and tables around. Very high ceiling, great rusty colors, a bit shadowy. I like it.   Cocktails! I tried a few that night, and I liked all of them (some more than others). In fact, these may be the best cocktails i have had in Pittsburgh so far.  Food! The bone marrows are as impressive as the other reviews say. Huge. No HUGE, and tasty. Not for the faint of hear though: that's not light on your belly. The duck was fantastic and so was the flat iron. The tartare was good, although I have had better in Pittsburgh (Salt's is often better for instance).   The portions are fit for Pittsburgh. Enormous. too much actually (do we need to have 3 enormous bones for the bone marrow?), but I suppose some would grumble on yelp if they were a tiny bit smaller. Yinzers have a big stomach.   The menu is not very large, and is fairly conservative (steaks, duck, salmon) with a few sandwiches. But it all seems very good.   Cons: the tables are really close to each other if you are dining in the section with tables for 2. You may hear your neighbors, and this may be less than exciting. At 8:30 a Tuesday, we did not have the problem. The tables emptied soon after we arrived. Good strategy.  The wine we tried (a malbec from argentina) was less than impressive. We did not finish it. Worth a star off? nope. The pros make up for it.   The coffee was god awful - what's wrong M&P? And there is no espresso. Really? Like in 2014, in a fancy restaurant?   Oh yeah and it's hard to get a table over the week end. Booking is required. The bar is also quite full over the week end.   We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Disappointed.   I've experienced M&P several times over the past year or so and my most recent trip did not live up to my expectations. My go-to dish is the pork chop...which has never let me down...until now The chop was seemingly undercooked (despite being ordered medium) and it's smoked flavor was definitely \"off\". In the past, the chop was akin to a deliciously smoked ham but not this time. I'm not sure if it was due to the amount of patrons ordering the dish that night and they were just pumping them out as quickly as possible, but I left there regretting my entree choice.   As for the rest of my experience that evening, I'd say it was average. The drinks were good and the service was as expected on a busy evening. However, with the main reason for going here being the food, I'll definitely think twice about returning any time soon."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went here for brunch. The service was outstanding and the food even better. We were told their would be a short wait which was to be expected, but the host came over and updated us which was much appreciated.   I ordered a bloody mary from the bloody mary bar. Wow, what a cool idea. They bring you infused vodka on ice and you take the glass up to the bar and create your own bloody mary. The bar had countless spices, hot sauces, vegetables and even had meats and cheeses you could add if you so desired.   The food was freaking incredible. My girlfriend got chicken and waffles, the waffles had jalapeño and cheddar in them, and it came with bacon syrup. The chicken was moist and tender.  My shrimp and grits were delicious. The shrimp were large and tasted so fresh, the grits were creamy and the sauce was succulent. The portion sizes of both meals were generous and that is a huge plus in my book.  Lastly, our server was a pro. He was quick, attentive, and knew the menu very well.   This was a slam dunk, 5 star experience all around. I will definitely be back and will bring visiting friends and family here when they are in town.   I give Meat and Potatoes my highest recommendation."}
{"text":"Was in town for a football game. Had only an hour to enjoy our last meal in Pittsburgh. Meat and Potatoes delivered! We started out with some drinks (bartenders are very creative) and the bone marrow - delicious! I had the pub burger - the most memorable burger in my life ... to date. It was cooked medium - juicy, flavorful, and the egg on top was creative and added to the overall experience. The fries on the side were, meh, but it didn't matter because the burger was beyond this world! The bun was soft and buttery, made in house. DH had the snapper topped with papaya salad. It was a light yet satisfying dish. We finished dinner with the cinnamon almond panna cotta (it was the special). It was just ok, but I'm sure that had we tried a different dessert, we would have been very pleased. We will definitely visit this place again the next time we're in town."}
{"text":"One of my go-to restaurants when I visit Pittsburgh! I definitely recommend a reservation if you can. The food is delicious. The service is always wonderful! When we go here before a concert, they always ask what time the concert is and make sure your food comes out at a timely manner. I'm in need of a concert to go to in Pittsburgh so I can come back here!"}
{"text":"The pub burger is the best burger in Pittsburgh. The bone marrow is a must when dining here. Drinks and bartenders are fantastic as well."}
{"text":"After a run of terrible cocktails, Meat & Potatoes came through for our desperate group. Food was excellent - steak tartare with smoked egg was fresh just the right coarseness and temperature, wild mushroom risotto was decadent and perfect as an app, duck breast was perfectly seasoned and cooked. Good vibe, excellent service."}
{"text":"There is this weird thing here in Pittsburgh where a lot of people seem to not care about the quality of the food, as long as the price is right and they get a lot of it. Meat and Potatoes, IMO, blows that out of the water. The portions and the quality more than make up for what some have called pricey. Personally, I don't think this place is expensive, it all depends on what you get. Everything I've had here is on point, and even if you are stuffed, make sure you leave room for dessert, as their rotating lists of desserts are all so delicious. Most recently I went for my birthday dinner, which happened to be during Pittsburgh Restaurant Week. The chef's menu theme was Southern, and every single course was exceptional, particularly the Chicken Waffle Tacos and Pecan Bread Pudding. If I had been home, I would have licked those plates!"}
{"text":"The El Diablo drink was great, also enjoyed the 3 little pigs sandwich"}
{"text":"Best brunch in the city!  Their brunch punch never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. I just moved back to Pittsburgh from LA and everyone has been saying that I needed to try Meat and Potatoes, so I finally did. It's not that the food was terrible, but it just wasn't impressive. We got the ribeye steak for 2, which was ridiculously salty, to the point that it wasn't enjoyable. We would have sent it back, but it takes 35 minutes to cook and we had to head out to see a show. Totally not worth it. I did like the strawberry and goat butter appetizer and the drinks were good. The service was also good. Overall, it's not an awful place, but I'm definitely not dying to go back. There are so many better restaurants in Pittsburgh, in my opinion."}
{"text":"This is a very fun place to go to, and has nice petite, intimate tables. My boyfriend took me here for vday. We started with the pear salad and cheese board. We absolutely LOVED the cheese board because it had so many fun flavors that you could mix and match. We got the 34oz steak to share and wow was that an experience. We managed to finish the entire thing and my bf was in heaven the whole time. My favorite part of the board was the bone marrow. We would definitely recommend coming here for a fun night!"}
{"text":"First time in Pittsburgh and this restaurant was the perfect introduction to the city! We had the charcuterie board, bone marrow and duck to share. I wasn't the biggest fan of the duck but everything was still amazing nonetheless. Our server was absolutely great but I've also got a give props to the runners and bussers as they were right on top of things. We're not generally fans of dimly lit restaurants but they nailed it because the ambiance was still inviting and embraced a neo-prohibition era feel. Wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"What a menu!  The diverse food selection is like no other. I have dined at restaurants all over the world, and this place is tops on my list.   The service was fast and extremely friendly. The food was fresh and delicious.  The prices were not inflated. It is not cheap, but it shouldn't be cheap with the quality and type of entrées they serve.   I love this restaurant and I will be back the next time I am in town!"}
{"text":"Was a bit disappointed. Ate at about 7 PM and all the steaks were gone. Seemed strange. Service also seemed to be a second thought. Would not go back."}
{"text":"Hadn't been here in a few years and glad we came back. Mussels were better than I remembered and the best we've had in a long time. I went for the meatloaf which did not disappoint.  It was hearty with enough fried onions to keep me happy. Will come back sooner"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to checking this place out. Especially since my sister really enjoyed this place before. I think my expectations were too high. Also, with it being a special occasion of her graduation-- I was hoping for a more memorable meal. Spending more at a restaurant does not ensure a great meal. I was left unsatisfied for the $200+ bill.  We ordered the: Poutine Bone marrow Pate Pub Burger Meat and Potatoes for two (we didn't get potatoes)  I felt much of the food was overdressed with too much salt. Not allowing the meat to shine."}
{"text":"Was in town for a business trip and heard from several people to try this restaurant out. Awesome atmosphere and amazing food! Hanger steak was so freakin good! Service was a bit slow but it wouldn't stop me from going again next time I am in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big meat-lover, but went a couple of times because I enjoyed the night-time ambiance. Enjoyed sitting at the bar, had good service, but because the menu is so meat-heavy (naturally, not a complaint), I had decided not to go there again.   However, I had recently looked at the Brunch menu, and thought it looked really inviting. Friends from Boston were visiting, so I took them this past Sunday. The atmosphere is definitely sexy and lovely at night, but during the day, it was disappointingly loud and garish. We were sitting under some kind of woofer and the beat was so insistent and loud, we had to shout to be heard. We asked the server if the volume could be adjusted, but it was clear, from his response, and the fact that the music was coming from a DJ, that no one was going to do anything to lessen the noise. Most of the tables were filled with older people and you could tell we weren't the only ones wanting to escape the loud thumping.  Come on, it's Sunday morning in Pittsburgh, not Friday night in South Beach. The food was mostly delicious but the atmosphere was so bad, we all agreed we would never do brunch there again."}
{"text":"Wife and I always get the meant and potatoes for 2. We also get an additional serving of bone marrow. We never finish our steak because it's so huge. Totally awesome food tho!"}
{"text":"Fantastic brunch choice! I had the grilled cheese w soup. It said tomato soup on the menu but it really wasn't. The soup it went w was celery or potato soup w pickles! It tasted wonderful! Cheese is good as always. I will try dinner this weekend! Also the libation choice is rich. I tried the lavender and I LOVED it."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best restaurants in the city. I've been at least six times since I moved last summer. You cannot go wrong, and top notch cocktails as well."}
{"text":"Quick Review: Good food, but I think the hype made it impossible to live up to expectations.   It seemed like everyone was raving about Meat & Potatoes, but we never seemed to get there for one reason or another. Finally, after buying tickets for a show I was able to get reservations for dinner pre-show.   The space itself is smaller than I expected, to the point that I actually felt a bit cramped.   The staff was incredibly friendly and it became clear that a few diners around us were regulars (one couple told us they lived in a condo nearby).   The alcohol selection was quite nice. I went with an old fashioned, my wife had wine.   Anytime I see duck on a menu I am tempted to order it. This was good, but nothing mind blowing. My wife ordered the Salmon which was, again, good but nothing incredible.  Again, I don't know if all of the hype made it impossible to meet expectations, but we both left the meal with the sentiment \"That was good, but not amazing.\"  I would be happy to go back and try again, but its not a high priority."}
{"text":"We went again over the summer on my birthday.   We started off with the Mac N Cheese appetizer (chorizo, pulled pork and loads of cheese!) So so good! A definite must try!  This time for our entree the wife and I shared the 34 oz rib eye for two. It comes with confit steak fries, house made steak sauce and bone marrow gratin. It is AMAZING and a bargain at $59 as we ate off of it for days!!  Our daughter had the Plain Jane burger with white cheddar cheese and loved it.   I'm glad I made reservations as the place was packed the whole time we were there.  Service was exceptional as our waitress Ashlee S was great and took good care of us.  I've said before and I'll say it again. THIS PLACE IS A MUST TRY!!!"}
{"text":"Our waitress, Sara, was so rude and obnoxious. Chicken and sausage was so dry that it could have been a hockey puck. The only good thing about this place was potato gnocchi."}
{"text":"What an amazing dinner, one of my most memorable culinary experiences. The paté and bone marrow appetizers were such a decadent treat. But the crowning glory of the meal was the 45oz bone in rib eye - WOW. It was cooked to perfection and was amazingly tasteful. No matter how good the food is (and it was incredible) no dining experience can be 5 star without great service. Jessica, you were exceptional. Thank you for making our evening perfect! You really are wonderful. I can't wait until my next trip back to the 'burgh to have you be part of my next Meat & Potatoes adventure!"}
{"text":"First time visiting Meat and Potatoes.  Great service. We sat at the bar and experienced bartenders with a passion. They took proud in their work and the creation of their drinks. The food was great. I ordered the mac n cheese with brisket appetizer and my husband got the catfish tacos and fries.   I wanted to kiss the chef that made the brisket. It was so tender and juicy. I didn't need a knife to cut it or my teeth to chew it. It just melted in my mouth. The french fries were perfectly seasoned as well."}
{"text":"After seeing this restaurant featured on a Chuck's Best Bite on the Cooking Channel, we knew we needed to come here. We are glad we did, and are considering coming back for brunch tomorrow on our way out of town. This place has great ambiance, friendly staff and AMAZING food. The seating was a little close (a long bench with chairs on the opposite sides for parties of 2) but that just meant we made some instant friends. Our server was professional and nice and our dinners arrived quickly and looked great. I had the pot roast w/whipped potatoes and my husband had the Papperdelle Pasta w rib tips. We shared and I have to say the Papperdelle wins. The sauce is delectable, the noodles cooked perfectly. I can't wait to come back for this! My pot roast was a smidgen dry but it was still extremely delicious. Overall our experience here was fantastic and I highly recommend come here for dinner (be sure to make reservations in advance, they fill up fast). BRAVO!"}
{"text":"Interesting menu, crowded energetic bar and dining area.  Cool area.  Seemed over-hyped on here."}
{"text":"We ate here on a date night that was totally arranged by my wife.  Despite the fact that I was semi-annoyed we had to drive into town from the 'burbs' during a trifecta of parking-hell (Pirate game, Regatta and \"Furry\" convention), I couldn't have been more pleased with our meal.  $20 parking was excessive, but to no fault of the restaurant.  Started with a steak tartare appetizer which was the best thing I've eaten in recent memory.  Followed it with the \"surf and turf\" special that, although a little pricey, was simply wonderful.  Wish we could have saved room for dessert, they all sounded terrific, but will have to wait for our next visit.  If you are expecting a private dining experience, Meat and Potatoes isn't your place.  Tables are very close together...so much so you could eat off of strangers plates. My wife hit a grand slam with this one though, can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Who can get mad about a steak as big as your head? We ordered the steak for two with potatoes and extra bread. The bone marrow was delicious (think beef flavored butter) and the first time I'd had this. Requested that the steak be cooked to medium and it was and was just delicious. They were excellent with fitting in my son, who is a toddler and the waiter was very friendly toward him. This restaurant isn't the largest, I do not think I would recommend it for a large crowd as it has open air and very little space between you and others. It wasn't especially loud or anything, but I wouldn't personally bring a big group here. Food was served up amazingly fast. HIGHLY recommend reservations because this place isn't large and there was a long wait if you didn't have reservations."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh!  Came here with a colleague for dinner and sat at the bar - ordered a number of courses and all the food was delicious.  I also have to say, from the host/hostess to the bartenders to the servers, everyone went out of their way to provide exceptional service.  Hands down one of the best dining experiences in Pittsburgh.  I will definitely be back often."}
{"text":"This was the first time I went to this restaurant. I saw it on a television show on the Travel Channel and thought I had to go, and I wasn't disappointed. It is a local restaurant in Pittsburgh and if you want a great steak and great atmosphere, do yourself a favor and definitely go to this place. I'm not a fan of chain restaurants and always look for locally owned, and this restaraunt is locally owned......thumbs up!"}
{"text":"While searching for a place for dinner with the boyfriend and the pseudo-in-laws, I stumbled upon the website for M&P. Open for less than a year, the menu for this awesome gastropub made my mouth water. A stellar selection of craft beers, decent wine, and a cocktail list using fresh ingredients that could warrant the term \"mixology\" but without the \"mixology\" price tag? I'm in!  But while the casual-hip atmosphere and well-curated libations are definitely reason enough to go here, the food stands out as innovative yet familiar; filling, well-executed, and affordable. Our table started the meal off with an order of their mussels cooked in a white wine sauce and served with fried taters (fries) with a black truffle aioli. These mussels were fresh and quite flavorful with the addition of smokey chorizo, chili, and broccolini- it's broth soaking in great flavor and accentuated with a touch of cream.  The boyfriend's parentals ordered the salmon (pictured at the top of this post) and the roast chicken, respectively. The salmon had a beautiful presentation and was exotic and packed some heat with its Brussels sprout kim chi, pineapple, chili, and Korean BBQ flavors. The Pan Roasted Chicken had more south of the border flavors with black beans, yucca fries, salsa verde, and queso fresco.  Boyfriend went the route of their Hudson Valley Duck Breast which was cleverly crusted with pastrami seasonings and served with sauerkraut pierogies, ramp butter, dandelion greens, and chimichurri- we shared bites of this and I must say, that duck was served at a perfect medium-rare and had loads of flavor. For my entree, the Braised Lamb Shank. I surprised even myself when I made this my dinner of choice, but the description sounded too good to pass up (and it did not disappoint). A giant bone-in lamb shank was placed before me; perfectly fall-of-the-bone tender and covered in a glorious sauce and gremolata. This entree was served on a bed of creamy Tuscan white beans, broccolini, and a bitter braised kale that helped cut through the fatty, homey goodness of the lamb. If you can't tell, I was an absolute fan of this dish.  Completely stuffed from this rich and comforting dinner, we opted to skip dessert. But with Southern Tier's Creme Brulee stout on the menu, the boy and I couldn't resist. Do yourself a favor and head to Meat & Potatoes next time you're in downtown Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"A Pittsburgh staple! Great vibe in downtown Pittsburgh. Their brunch is simply amazing."}
{"text":"Top notch, interesting dishes.  Can't recommend it enough. Maybe not the best for vegan/vegetarian fare, but it is called MEAT & Potatoes. Carnivores only."}
{"text":"I had such a great time eating (and drinking here).  The atmosphere was wonderful, with casual picnic tables and lots of music.  We spent about two hours, slowly working through apps and beer then lunch/dinner.  The pretzels were good, the beer cheese made them great.  The brats were wonderful.  The red cabbage was a surprise hit as well.  I tried the beer in a flight to try each, but went back for more of the dunkel and hefeweizen.  The dunkel was a real treat.  I recommend to plan to spend a good amount of time here.  Also, very kid friendly.  Next time I am in Pittsburgh I will try again."}
{"text":"I REALLY wanted to like this place. It was an awful experience from start to finish. The food was eh. Service was eh. It took our food over an hour to come out from the kitchen. Totally unimpressed and I won't be back."}
{"text":"I've gone to Meat & Potatoes for both dinner and brunch and experiences were great! My favorite part were the portion sizes, they're huge and delicious.  The brunch was probably my favorite. I got the chicken and waffles, and it was superb. Couldn't recommend this place enough for brunch. Be sure to make a reservation well in advance, they always seemed to be full booked 3-4 days ahead of time."}
{"text":"Bruhhhh my favorite restaurant in the burgh amazing food excellent service great hospitality and the music was phenomenal make sure you ask for Samantha as your server"}
{"text":"This place really outshined my expectations. I had heard a lot about it and read several reviews. It's tough to get into and you must make reservations but it's worth it. It's not really a family place but we did take our 3 boys (11, 13 & 15) here and their loved it. They are used to eating at more upscale restaurants and are try foodies so the thought it was fantastic. Or waitress was awesome and made us feel very welcome. I mention this because we have beenough to other upscale places with the kids that act like we don't belong because we have kids with us. Not here. The food was excellent! I had my first experience with Wagyu Beef and I'm ruined on steaks now. Holly mother of all... It's life changing. Great gastro pub in the Burgh. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with a younger clientele (30s-40s).   I had a Martini with some Chicken wings and fried brussels sprouts. It was all great! Downtown Pittsburgh can be hit or miss with some of its restaurants. This one's a hit!"}
{"text":"I usuall. don't go out of my way to write reviews but created a yelp account after my experience here tonight. Upon entering my friend and I were greeted immediately by friendly faces at the host stand. We did not have a reservation but we stopped in anyway to see if we could be accommodated.  Thankfully,  the great host staff was able to get us a table. I can not say enough how impressed I was with the hosts tonight. They were able to fit us in and were so kind. One complimented my jacket and even offered to hang it up for me. I thought their style was impeccable as well. I was impressed. What I was not so impressed by was what seemed to be a manager or owner (shorter husky man with dark hair)  who seemed to be very unnecessarily harsh with the staff. That's something I always hate seeing while dining out. We enjoyed the food that came out of the kitchen but were completely unimpressed with our server Crystal. She came off as very cold and annoyed with having to be there. On the slim chance we return, we'll be trying the bar. Hopefully the bartenders will treat us better than Crystal."}
{"text":"It was great. Yep. That's the end of the review.   All right, I came out here for dinner and I was incredibly pleased at my decision, so much, in fact, that I skipped out on another place my second night and came here again, for reasons outlined later.   First night was mostly appetizers on my end. I made the mistake, if there ever was one, of ordering the famed bone marrow appetizer, which the waiter cautioned was more of a 'sharing' app. Whatever. It looked great in the pictures so I got it.. and yes. It was a delicious pile of bones with bone marrow to scoop out of with all of its super fatty greasy sweet goodness. Yes, it did start to get overwhelming at the end. Yes, it was a ton of food for a reasonable price. So my original intention was to order the pork chop (which in itself is enormous) but no, I had to stop with the steak tartare appetizer and close out with drinks.   Let's talk about drinks. I like fancy craft cocktails. I also like rare liquors that are hard to find in the States. Meat & Potatoes has both. Greta was my bartender for that evening and we started off conservatively with stuff on the menu but by oh, drink four, I was peeking through her bartender's black book for novelty's sake. She also alerted me to Fernet Branca Mentha, which is a super minty version of Fernet.   Second night was the pork chop that almost got away. Stuck to the basics, got it, and it was perfect. Beautiful presentation, just done right pork, and it was enormous amounts of food for reasonable prices (for a high end gastropub... bear in mind, I come from the DC area where stuff like this cost 2-10x more). Admittedly, it was less memorable and more basic than night one's debauchery of meat butter and raw meat. The fried brussel sprouts though. Get them. Those WERE incredibly memorable from the second night.   Get reservations. They're probably one of the most desired restaurants in town. Great service, great food, awesome experience."}
{"text":"Place has great food, but is a bit pricey. Plus the seating for tables is a bit uncomfortable."}
{"text":"The food was different and amazing!  I could have stopped at the Brussels sprouts!  THE BRUSSELS SPROUTS!!!  OMG!  But I kept going and if I could have I would have kept going and going and going!!!  Amazing food!  The only reason the 5th star is missing is because the server was a bit off putting- almost seemed annoyed to have customers.  She was lucky the food was incredible."}
{"text":"As of this date, December 2011, this is the best join in Pittsburgh.  There's only one kicker, you have to come 3 times to figure it out!  Visit 1. Fancy Dinner: Go, order the delicious \"Manhattan\" they've aged and pour into a cup for you.  Perhaps a bottle of wine with dinner.  Order the rib-eye FOR SURE (it comes with marrow so you can skip that at appetizer time, it's great, but use your \"room\" for the appy that delights you most.  Visit 2. Brunch: Bloody bar, check, bacon vodka suggested.  I got the hash (Meat and Potatoes right?!).  Wow, so good.  Visit 3: Casual Dinner: Burgers and Beers.  They've got a great selection of both.  Maybe start your meal with the \"snacks.\"  Friend brussel sprouts anyone, yeah, I think so!"}
{"text":"Visiting from San Diego we stumbled along the Meat & Potatoes website. The options sounded great and the other Yelp reviews made up our minds for us. We paid for parking, walked a couple of blocks and were NOT thrilled to hear there was a 4 hour wait - are you kidding me! We were told we could check the seating around the bar, we did. Squeezed into 2 end seats and were quickly greeted by the bartender complete with page-boy cap, suspenders, white t with sleeves rolled 3/4 of the way up - really added to the decor.  My hubby started with the Dunquesne Pilsner beer, and I started with an iced tea. The beer, in the words of my hubby, \"it was a good drinking beer\".   Our starter was the Artisanal Cheese Board, and it was super yummy! The local cheese was tasty, but my fav was the local strawberry preserves! Fresh dates, apple slices, candied pecans and toasted fresh bread were great accompaniments to the cheese.  Our entrees: Pappardelle for my hubby and the Brisket Sandwich. My mouth still waters when I think of my hubby's Pappardelle pasta! The pasta was fresh made, the short rib and pork shoulder were perfectly tender and tasty, the bolognese sauce was the perfect addition, not too overpowering, just right! My Brisket Sandwich was good, very big! The slaw was a little different than I expected, not in a bad way though. The overall taste was good, a solid 3 stars, but the Pappardelle deserved a solid 5 stars!  The overall place gets a solid 4 stars, but the pasta dish and our bartender service gets a 5!"}
{"text":"So I'm a little in love with this place right now.  And damn, I forgot to steal a cool \"cuts of cow\" coaster again!  I've been here twice now, both times to the bar area.  Thursday night was packed, room in the dining area for reservations only.  So I wandered to the bar and found a seat.  The bartenders...these guys are the best.  Cecil (I think)...is the man.  Their cocktail list is short, but these guys know their stuff.  I opted for the Pimm's Blue Ribbon - which combines my two favorites, St. Germain and PBR.  This is a dangerously drinkable drink...I know, I had several.  The gentleman next to me had a Sazerac, which I hadn't experienced before.  This is where Cecil stepped in and gave us a vibrant and detailed history of the drink - which was awesome.  The Sazerac isn't on the cocktail list, but again these guys know their stuff, and I would recommend giving it a shot if you enjoy Rye.  Then, for food.  Well by this point I've noshed on the Brussel sprouts, and exquisite Ceasar salad, the Lobster Mac n Cheese and the Banana Pie.  Brussel spouts are very good, but the dipping sauce they come with is even better.  Not potent, but buttery and smooth.  The Cesear salad is creamy, and topped with real, homemade pork rinds.  Now, these have never appealed to me before - but the crunchy texture and saltiness in contrast to the salad (topped with an egg...yes) was spot on.  Lobster mac is as pure as it can be.  I stopped in last night for dessert and tried the banana pie.  What came out was a little jar of heaven.  It was a banana bread type deal, layered with whipped cream and caramel...and there was a hint of peanut butter.  It was good.  With the bartenders and solid food, I would definitely recommend this place.  The atmosphere is upscale but casual and in a great locale."}
{"text":"Finally got around to eating here, and the food lived up to the hype (at least my food).  I had the baked rigatoni - contained pork shoulder ragu.  This was a huge helping, with more meat than rigatoni! I didn't notice the pancetta in this dish, though listed in the ingredients.  It was fabulous, with a huge portion to take home (should reheat well, too). My lunch partner had the house smoked duck salad. It was a very small portion - the salad was the size of a side salad, with four smallish slices of duck on top. She felt that it was overdressed.  For the price, the size was disappointing. I will echo the other reviews that note that the seating is awkward and close together.  As the Washington Post dining critic, Tom Sietsema often notices, a proprietor should sit in every seat of the house to experience the customer's viewpoint before opening.  We were seated next to two large (tall, broad shouldered men) who had some difficulty and awkwardness in getting into their seats.  I had almost no leg room.  The 2 tops are just awkward. Service was fine, no problems. We were pretty low maintenance. My drink was refilled quickly and our seating and food service were prompt.  I look forward to dining here again, and my husband will be grateful for the leftovers tonight!"}
{"text":"The service is fantastic. We got chatty with one of the bartenders and he was super helpful in telling us what we should or shouldn't get into during our time in Pittsburgh.  The food is bar none. I can't imagine there being too many other places in Pittsburgh as good as this place.  The brunch was one of the best I've ever been to in my life.   We didn't plan to come to this place, we stumbled upon it, and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very very trendy. Small quaint place with a ton of options for specialty cocktails. Make sure that you get there early. Seats are limited."}
{"text":"the bone marrow was amazing!! I enjoyed everything that I ordered, and I'll definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"I tag-teamed the 45 oz ribeye with a friend. It looked like something from the Flintstones and nearly defeated us. The presentation was incredible and I was really pleased with the service - we sat at the bar. I highly recommend this restaurant for a tasty and unique dinner that you won't soon forget."}
{"text":"In Pittsburgh for one night - this place had some great reviews - had to be done. I'm not familiar with Pittsburgh so didn't know if Parking would be an issue. Happy to discover there is very reasonable parking in the same building as the restaurant.   The inside was pretty full and busy, a little loud but not terrible. Some baffling would probably help a little bit with that.   As a starter I ordered their special Negroni and two small apps. The Negroni - in a word - was excellent. Here's what makes theirs different: Nolets Rose Petal Infused Dry Gin, Campari and Lillet Rouge (Fortified Wine). The fortified wine is a sub for the standard sweet vermouth - and it worked quite well. To accompany that I tried the  Grilled Bread with Goat Butter and Seasonal Jam and the Fried Brussels with Parmesan and Lemon Aeoli. The Brussels were very nice fried but I would have loved them as much if they were simply roasted. The combination of the slight bitterness of the Brussels Sprouts with the savory Parmesan and the ever so slight hint of sweetness in the Lemon Aeoli - was such a nice contrast. And then you switch to the grilled bread - and hit some other regions of the palate - tossing a sip of the Negroni - magic.   I could have stopped there but, as I was leaving the next day, wanted to try at least one of the Mains. So I ordered the Pappardelle - with Bolognese, Short Rib, Pancetta, Pork Shoulder and Garlic Bread on the side.  It was very well prepared and presented. I would have probably enjoyed it more if I hadn't already indulgent the apps. But that's my fault!   I ate at the bar and the servers there worked well as a team - both giving excellent and efficient and friendly service. Very professional. Would definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"Rude rude rude. Don't waste your time and money here. The foods not that good and their attitude is even worse!"}
{"text":"If you are in Pittsburgh on the weekend and looking for brunch, THIS IS THE PLACE!!! Cool atmosphere with a DJ spinning tunes and a BloodyMary bar.   Fried taters with truffle oil cooked to perfection, and our entrees (Chicken and Waffles and the Hash) were incredible.   Huge portions.    I only wish I could come here every weekend!"}
{"text":"Tried this place on the prix fixe menu during restaurant week. Loved every single plate that was put in front of me. Tried it for brunch. Even better. If you haven't gone yet, just do it."}
{"text":"I had one of the best and most interesting meals here. Everything I tried was absolutely delicious. I only say interesting because they have so many delicacies on the menu that you don't find at most restaurants. I had a few firsts here and it was very memorable. With so many reviews on Yelp and their 4 star rating, I could not wait to try it.   Not having a reservation I was expected to be turned away at this popular restaurant but was pleasantly surprised when the hostess was able to get us seated in less than 10 mins in the alternate dining room.   From the moment I was handed the legal sized file folder that contained the two page menu, I was like a kid in a candy store. They had fresh mussels of the day prepared in 3 special ways. I ordered the bone marrow appetizer as it was highly recommended (my first time). It was delicious and very large as a starter.  For my main course I ordered the Steak Diane with the baked potato. The steak was huge and was cooked perfectly with a very delicious savory sauce. I normally do not eat baked potatoes but this one was to die for!   The drink menu was also very nice. Every drink I tried was very delicious. They have my favorite dark rum (Cruzan Black Strap) and it was a perfect compliment in the \"dark and stormy\". I also tried for my first time absinthe. They had a good selection. I definitely saw the green fairy after that drink!  Overall it was a great experience and I will be back as soon as possible!"}
{"text":"We had brunch here on Christmas Eve, and the experience couldn't have been better. Our reservation was for a half hour before they were to close, so we were a little nervous that the service or food may suffer , as it does in so many places that close to closing time. Not the case!   The portions were large and satisfying. I had the Huevos Rancheros, which was the best I've ever had. Coming from someone who lived in Mexico, and has been back to visit many times, this is really saying something. They were even better than I make at home!  I truly respect a restaurant that has so much faith in its food that there isn't a salt shaker to be seen on not one table. One was not needed.  The service was wonderful. The server was always there for our every need, without hovering over our table, and was very knowledgeable about the menu. She steered us all in the right direction with her recommendations, and we all left extremely satisfied and pleasantly plump.   Suffice it to say, this will not be our last trip to Meat stand Potatoes!"}
{"text":"All the hype around this place, it's all true. Both the experience and the food are in line with each other and it's all worth the trouble of finding an open table here. Definitely reserve a table in advance. When my husband and I went, we were lucky to find an open table as walk-ins, possibly because it was a weeknight. We ordered the Devils on horseback, Thai curry mussels (with fries) and the pork belly tacos. Omg the flavors here are so incredibly bold, but not overpowering in any way. The reason for my reduction of one star you ask? I got sick afterwards. I can't exactly pinpoint this meal as the culprit, but I'm almost certain the mussels were it. Despite getting a little sick, I would definitely come back to try something different next time. The food here is just that worth it."}
{"text":"The food was brought out HOT, just what you'd expect after almost a half hour waiting to be seated and an additional half hour to get our food,  which we ordered right when we sat down.... and after all that wait,  my food was overcooked (chicken and waffles). If you choose this venue,  definitely make a reservation; however, the water was great and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"I'm officially updating my review of this place. We stopped by tonight for dinner and it was not good. We ordered the tartare, soft shell crab tacos and the curried moules with frites. The moules were ok. The mussels were like warm, but the sauce was hot. The soft shell crab was not soft. We pulled out bones/shells in every bite. The frites with black truffle mayo were amazing. The tartare was slimy and fishy. We sent it back because it tasted so unseasoned and almost rancid. The manager told us the chef made a new batch. When it came it was just as bad as the first batch. We have been here before several times and have always ordered the tartare. It has always been really good. This one lacked any flavor. You could tell the didn't add an acid or mustard or anything. We sent the second batch back too. yuck. I would not return. In addition, they overcharged our bill by up charging our drinks and other orders. I would not return. There are better places to go... Like Tamari!"}
{"text":"I've eaten brunch here twice.  Everytime I say... NEVER AGAIN.  Of course, I somehow get subjected to it again.  I gave it 2 stars because the bloody mary bar is pretty damn sweet, but that's mostly because I can mix a mean bloody mary.  It has VERY little to do with this place. I got to foccacia this last time, it was horrible.  My eggs were FULLY cooked and bland.  The brisket on top was completely leather.  The cheese was scarce and burned.  The potatoes were undercooked and cold.  So... they messed up my MEAT and my POTATOES?  That's just too rich."}
{"text":"From its name I thought this might be a steak house, but in fact there was a variety of menu items, all put together creatively with flavorful, complimentary ingredients.  Good selection of wines and beers too.  We started out with the Devils on Horseback appetizer - OMG, the flavors!  I'm glad the waiter suggested we add a 4th to the order of 3, or my husband and I may have fought over the last one.  I had the lamb shank, which was fall-off-the-bone tender, and my husband had the salmon, which was prepared to the perfect doneness.   I have a gluten allergy, so I was grateful for the GF menu, which has most of the regular menu items but modified to be GF.  We didn't have a reservation on a Saturday night, so we went early (5:15) and had no problem getting a seat for dinner at the bar, which was a fun spot to be."}
{"text":"We were looking for nice dining experience and this restaurant was recommended and did not disappoint. The place is very popular and we had reservations that we made through Yelp and the Table was ready when we arrived. We started off with a couple Old Fashions which were excellent. We ordered the Brussels sprouts and the Chicken livers for appetizers which were so good. For Dinner we had the Brenzino and the Bone in Filet both prepared to perfection. The waitress was very attentive and overall a really great dining experience. We will be back again for sure."}
{"text":"Have been several times for dinner--always excellent--short rib flatbread is magical.  I went to brunch here for first time.  Short rib hash with 2 perfectly luscious poached eggs.  Perfection."}
{"text":"Not at all what I expected. A name like Meat and Potatoes, with an emphasis on pork shoulder and belly, conjures thoughts of sawdust floors and smokehouse. Meat and Potatoes is shooting for the downtown Pittsburgh crowd (i.e.,dressed up rich suburban Pittsburghers between 35 and 60). The meat and cocktails are very good, the service is friendly, and the atmosphere is upscale. Mussels were ok. The Porter House for 2 is truly excellent.   My  burger was ok (for medium rare, it was much more toward the medium side). Definitely try the Sazerac if you're into cocktails. The bread pudding was tasty.  This would be a good place to go on a date, with friends, or a client if everyone is in the mood for a steak dinner. Plan to spend ~$65 and be overly full. Avoid before the theatre rush; it gets crowded."}
{"text":"Meat and potatoes for two is the only thing I'll ever order there simply because my brain and stomach won't let me. Girlfriend agrees, my only complaint is that she puts down as much steak as me! :("}
{"text":"I arrived with a couple friends for a Sunday brunch.  The menu was very intriguing and I ordered the Irish eggs benedict (corned beef) on the basis of a recommendation from the bartender.   A monstrosity appeared as my meal and at first I was quite worried due to the size that it would not be great.  Fortunately, the dish was succulent and despite my better judgement I finished all of the huge platter of 2 poached eggs and corned beef, although I did leave much of the hollandaise sauce as it was too much.  The wait staff were attentive and I was able to try a number of microbrew Stouts with the Irish eggs benedict (these went together quite well) as my glass never was quite finished before they asked if I wanted another.  There is also an incredible scotch cabinet as you walk in the door.  This is one of the best collections of scotch that I have seen outside of NYC."}
{"text":"Very hearty brunch with pretty typical fare done exquisitely."}
{"text":"This is going to be a hard review to write. First of all, I very much love meat & potatoes. The food is amazing and atmosphere is awesome and this is definitely one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh. But something happened while I was dining there with my husband in the summer that made me really disappointed about the restaurant.  My husband and I went to Meat & Potatoes on a Friday night and we ordered the Meat & Potatoes for Two and with the mushroom as a side (we paid $8 for this side if I remember correctly). It is a big dish so in the end we couldn't finish the steak and we had a large portion of mushroom left. When the waiter came and took our bill, I told him to box the remaining food that we couldn't finish. He came back with our bill and a paper bag. I trusted that he packed everything in so I didn't check the bag to see what was inside. The next day after we got home, I was very excited to eat the leftover but only to find that the waiter did not pack any of our remaining mushroom, which was a large portion left on the plate. I was very disappointed so I called the restaurant right away. Someone picked up the phone and was not very concerned at all and told me the manager would call me back about this issue. However, almost 2 months have passed and I have received no calls from Meat & Potatoes ever since.  I know people might think I'm being cheap here because it's only the mushroom! However, I did pay for that dinner (which was not cheap at all) and was told to be expecting a phone call from the manager. People are not to be fooled like this.  Sorry, I know the food is brilliant but I would not come back again."}
{"text":"Not sure why I didn't try this place earlier. Really nice environment and more casual than I expected.  Our service was very attentive but not pushy.  Definitely the favorite thing we ordered was the flat iron steak."}
{"text":"My advice to the owners of this restaurant.  When someone comes in for lunch, and there are 40 minutes left, don't tell them, \"we have to be respectful of our servers than need to leave at 2.\"  Maybe, I don't know, you as an employee should be more respectful of your owner's business.  And, no, we don't want to eat at the bar on a limited menu.  Company owners try so hard to establish a good business and it only takes one rude, poorly trained employee to ruin the experience and cause a poor review to be written."}
{"text":"My husband and I are huge fans of poutine, so we knew we had to come here after we found out they have it on the menu! Food was great, service was good, and we would definitely come back! Definitely get the mussels -- SO good."}
{"text":"Just a quickie.  One of my favorite Pgh restaurants.  Evening meal is perhaps overrated. But. the Sunday Brunch, is great. Feels like you are in a  \"Proper city\" nice well done comfort food and the vodka bar, perfect for taking any guest or even yourselves for a special or not so special Sunday."}
{"text":"We stopped by shortly before opening to get a table for brunch, none were available but we were able to snag a seat at the bar. Service was quick & decent. We took advantage of the Bloody Mary bar- I had bacon vodka (the only non-spicy option), while my husband had the honey Sriracha. The bar itself was great! I love mine a little dirty & was disappointed to not find olive juice on the bar. Fun experience & there were plenty of items you could probably make 2-3 skewers if you put everything on! Onto the food. I asked the server if the eggs in purgatory was in a tomato ragu (I saw a mushroom ragu on the menu too) and he said \"no, it's mushroom.\" Based on his response I ordered that. To my surprise, it came out as a tomato sauce. Had I known (why I asked), I would've ordered something else. Very disappointed, and the reason for 3 stars. To have a server not know the ingredients in your regular menu items (it'd be better to say \"not sure, let me check\") is unacceptable.  The dish was fine, just not what I expected. My husband had the chicken & waffle- huge portion but the bones in chicken always make it tough to eat. He enjoyed the subtle spice from the jalapeños (he says 3.5 stars). I was very excited about this place with the high rating & countless reviews, but am disappointed."}
{"text":"I love the pork chop, steak tartare, bone marrow and of course the tomahawk steak for two. But my very favorite is still the pub burger with fries. Huge steak burger, horseradish cheddar, pork belly pastrami, special sauce, and a gooey fried egg. It's a beautiful Sunday afternoon so I just took a walk with the dog, stopped at M&P, and picked up a burger to go. You just can't beat it!"}
{"text":"The ambiance at Meat & Potatoes is 5 stars.  It's unique without taking that so far as to make people uncomfortable. It's warm and bright and dark and cozy all at once with captivating light fixtures, various size tables and tufted chairs.  It's more special and sparkly than a home, but it's not stiff or formal.  The menu isn't overly broad but there's something for everyone.  And the presentation?  Impressive.  The Pork for instance, looked like a polished version of something that would've been served to the Flinstones.  Huge and glossy with homestyle fixins.  It tasted good, but it didn't quite live up to its looks.  The Pork was tasty but slightly (and I mean slightly) chewy and the greens had a vinegar note that didn't quite blend with the rest of the dish and the beans were (nicely) more interesting than one would expect for baked beans, but they were quite firm for beans in a way I'd consider undercooked.  I rarely indulge in french fries, and I'm pleased to say, these ones were well worth the splurge.  Crispy without being burnt, nicely salted, and the large portion is.... well, large.  We ordered another entree, but the presentation of the pork so overshadowed it, I can't even remember what it was!  In the end, the star of the show was the Fried Brussels.  Seemingly a staple at hipster joints nationwide, one could rue the unoriginal dish in place of something more locally inspired, but... Yum.   So crispy and dusted with parmesan and the aioli.  Thank you, Meat & Potatoes, for keeping it simple, simple, simple.  I had a child with me who declared they would eat brussels every meal if I could recreate the dish.    It was an enjoyable meal that didn't blow me away, apart from the brussels (which, I was able to recreate, sans the aioli, at home with a shocking amount of oil.).    The wait staff was pleasant though a little scattered... Rushing away forgetting that we wanted to order dessert (good but nothing to write home about) and in the end, after we asked them to package an entire leftover flatbread that went uneaten, they never brought it out.  We could have asked a third time, but headed home without it."}
{"text":"We were in town for an event last weekend and this place came highly recommended for Sunday brunch and it was a fantastic recommendation!    We had an amazing brunch on Sunday and the bloody mary bar was also top notch.   I got the chicken and waffles and they were delicious! Not to mention the fact that you get, like, a mountain of fried chicken to go along with the cheddar an jalapeno waffle with the bourbon bacon syrup.  It was a ton of food but I couldn't stop eating it.  It was one of the best means I've had in a long time.    My wife had the Brisket & Eggs and it was equally delicious.  I only tried a bite as I had a lot of work to do, but I would have no problem ordering that dish next time we go there.    To go along with the fantastic food was the music!  Vex was playing some very appropriate, nice music that stretches well beyond Top 40 standards.  I was impressed by the stuff he was playing and I think the music was perfect for Sunday brunch.    I will recommend this place to anyone that asks...or doesn't ask.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Love everything about this place!! Staff Friendly. The wife Loves it . Very filling !! Come Hungry"}
{"text":"What a meal! Started with a sampling of the black truffle fries, the 'Devils on Horseback' (best dish of the night, chorizo wrapped in a date wrapped in bacon), and a pile of wings that were spectacular.   I had the Wagyu filet for dinner - very good. My friend had that pork chop that was almost the size of my arm and it was delicious as well.  Ended the night with a creme brulee that was perfectly done (warm center).  The ambiance was great, only complaint would be a lacking wine list."}
{"text":"A friend and I popped in to Meat & Potatoes for brunch on Saturday and ended up having one of the best meals / food experiences of my life!  We didn't have reservations, but they were able to comfortably accommodate us at the bar.  We had some of their specialty cocktails, which were all expertly mixed, aesthetically appealing, and delicious.  For brunch, I had the chicken and waffles and my friend had the flatbread salmon, both from the regular menu.  The chicken was quite possibly the best fried chicken I've ever had, and my friend's flatbread lox was so fresh and delicious.  The atmosphere was interesting and trendy without being uncomfortable, and the service was good as well as friendly.    Additionally, the waitstaff and bartenders all seemed to be enjoying their work, which always speaks volumes to me about they way an eating establishment is run.  I highly recommend Meat & Potatoes to anyone looking for a fun dining experience with original food ideas executed perfectly."}
{"text":"Food was delicious! We ordered the short rib flat bread, Wow! The layers of flavor were so well put together. I ordered the duck. Again delicious. The spaetzel  was a little crunchy, but overall well worth it!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent and the ambience is unique.  I particularly liked their martini bar.   The only negative was that we waited along time for a table even though we had reservations and the noise level made it difficult for conversation.    I would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"This is a nice restaurant that is within walking distance to many attractions downtown.   Pros: The staff is great.  Multiple times, a server would stop and ask how our meal was and if our drinks were ok.    Our meal was served quickly even though the place was packed.  The drinks were of upscale quality.   Cons: The place was at max capacity and the tables are so close you end up hearing the next tables conversation.  They in turn hear yours and can lead to them chiming in on your conversation.   We ordered the 45oz steak for 2 people.  I do not recommend getting this as it is only a novelty item. The steak was 35% fat and was of poor quality.  We would have been better off ordering individual steaks which would have been much better."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to go to Meat & Potatoes for some time now. We finally got there a few weeks ago. My husband's boss from Sweden was in town and we wanted to take her somewhere nicer in town for dinner. Unfortunately when I called to make reservations no one answered. So we just decided to walk-in. I should have called again about reservations though instead of just winging it, because when we got there, the place was packed and the only availability they had for a half-hour was on the patio. We decided that was okay, ordered drinks at the bar and then were seated outside.  I know this is not the fault of the restaurant at all...but it was about 8:30pm on a weeknight, and as soon as we were seated we were greeted outside by obnoxious jack-hammering across the street. We decided this would be pretty annoying throughout our meal, so we asked the waitress if there was any possible way we could get a table inside. It took about another half-hour, but we were seated at a table in the restaurant.   We order the fried brussel sprouts as an appetizer. Unfortunately I did not think they were very good. I also thought it was weird appetizers are served in cardboard food boats you usually see at concession stands. I guess it was supposed to be ironic. So appetizer in general just wasn't too thrilling.  For my entree I had the duck, which was pretty delicious. My husband and his boss were also happy with their entrees despite the hiccups getting seated and the stinky appetizer.   Like I said, I know the jackhammer wasn't the restaurants fault. It just kind of put a bit of a damper on the rest of the experience. Maybe my expectations were also really high from all the buzz I heard about Meat & Potatoes. For the prices though I just didn't think it was 5 stars this time. I'd like to go back and try their brunch though. Perhaps that will make me add a star or two!"}
{"text":"The options I had were limited, disappointed. I have celiac Meat & Potatoes, you would thing they would have more options for gluten fee. The meat did taste good"}
{"text":"Enjoyed brunch here in January.  We loved the atmosphere except for the cramped tiny tables.  I don't see how a large person would navigate the seating. I had the chicken and waffles.  The chicken was tasty but the leg was still red near the bone.   My husband had the huevos rancheros and he wasn't a fan.  I'd love to try it again for dinner or happy hour mainly due to the atmosphere, location and interesting food options."}
{"text":"I have only been here once. I had the mussels and a craft beer. The mussels were a little salty and fishy, but overall pretty good. The beer was good too."}
{"text":"Referred by a friend. Really unimpressed with food.  Started with warm water and ended with under seasoned pot roast. The waitress kept saying Awesome.  It wasn't!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for dinner at 6:00 pm while in town for work on a Monday night without reservations.  Dining couldn't seat us until 7:30 but was able to grab a seat at bar. Good cocktail and beer list. Ordered the Waygu Sirloin and it was cooked to my medium rare request. It was accompanied by some very yummy potatoes. Good overall service at the bar with some wonderful bearded gentlemen adding to their fun atmosphere. Felt a bit like a place you could find in Portland, OR"}
{"text":"It was our first time in Pittsburgh, so my girlfriend and I had no clue where to go. After parking in the Theater Garage and being stuck in a downpour with no umbrella, we stumbled into Meat and Potatoes, and so glad that we did.  At 1030pm, there was still a 20 minute wait so we started with a drink at the bar. The whole establishment feels like a bourbon bar/speakeasy, and is unlike any other place we've ever been. While enjoying a drink at the bar, all three bartenders engaged us in conversation and made us feel right at home. We decided to order just a few small plates and eat at the bar.  We started with a short rib flatbread that was very unique and delicious. Next came the Devils on horseback. Being from Baltimore, we are accustomed to oysters, however these were served with dates. They were a little heavy for our taste, but very flavorful. The standout dish was their fried brussel sprouts. They were so crispy and crunchy, but still had their earthy sort of flavor. I would come back just for an order of those. The bartenders were also making gourmet cocktails with ingredients I had never even heard of. The speed well was right in front of us so we got to smell all of the drinks as they were being made.   Overall, a very unique atmosphere,great food, great drinks, and an amazing staff. They made us feel right at home and I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I was visiting my sister from out-of-town and she HAD to bring me to this place for our night out together. Overall, we had a great visit but our service for most of the evening severely lacked which is why I am deducting one star!   Our reservation was at 6:45pm and we arrived a little early at 6:30pm, so while we waited for a table, we sat at the bar to order some drinks. We got delivered a menu and patiently waited for the entire 15 minutes to be acknowledged by someone behind the bar. I tried to understand since they were busy. But, there were 4 bartenders behind the bar and 2 out of 4 of them were hand-washing cups. We felt awkward not being acknowledged by anyone, so this started our evening off a little sour.   We did get our table as promised by 6:45pm and waited around for our server to show up and take our orders. Meanwhile all tables around us are being acknowledged and served. Eventually after a few minutes of sitting, our waiter did come over to our table to take our drink and food orders. We started off with some mussels. These mussels were amazing. The only complaint I had was I wanted MORE!!! They were ridiculously flavorful and just downright amazing (I highly recommend the curry mussels). We ordered some pate too, it was pretty good - but I would recommend mussels for sure!!  Next on to our entrees; my sister ordered the duck and I ordered the steak; extremely flavorful, delicious food. On another level - that is for sure! I absolutely couldn't get over the amount of flavors inside of my dish, it was some of the best I've ever tasted. Again, the food was absolutely tremendous. However, it was extremely frustrating to watch out for our waiter who was serving tables around us, but did not come back to ours. He went back to other tables most of the night to refill beverages but for some reason; he didn't even come over to ours. We had to flag him down to get another alcoholic beverage. Overall, I was extremely disappointed in the service and my sister (who visits this place often) stated that the service has NEVER been that way, and usually most of the servers are very proactive. I was pretty disappointed as it did cause a slight damper, but overall the food was pretty damn amazing. I would definitely return but I would hope to have way better service in the restaurant and at the bar."}
{"text":"Portions are huge so bring your appetite. Bone marrow was good but I think Butcher and the Rye's was better. Food is good but everything is really heavy. Not really recommended for anyone that's trying to diet."}
{"text":"I was only there once and it was great. A menu that has lite bites and real apps. ....awesome Had the pork and it was thick and juicy Dessert was a warm banana bread and it was great. Would love to get back there....if you live in Pittsburgh your blessed !"}
{"text":"(11/10/2014)  Heard a lot about Meat and Potatoes, was mentioned in Bon Appetit's article about Pittsburgh being the next big food city.  We arrived close to 10pm on a Monday night, place was bustling, very loud (DJ spinning tunes in the corner, luckily in my age group), full of the pretty people here to see and be seen.  A large bar hogs up most of the main room, a circular dining area rings it.  Place is dimly lit, beautiful dark wood and cast iron, marble and mirrors, like a 19th century parlor.    We were seated towards the end of the bar at an unfortunate turn in the dining room.  Overflow from the bar made passage pretty tight.  Dimwit hostess tried to seat another group between us, either she gave up trying to make me move into oncoming traffic or the incoming guests decided (wisely to ask for another table).  The place pretty much filled to the gills, then I realized, duh, Monday night late menu special \"Night Cap\" (starts at 10pm).   Cocktails, Prohibition-era, were the best of the night (this was stop #6 on a self-guided restaurant crawl of downtown Pittsburgh).  My friend had the 25th Hour (subbed vodka), I had the Southie; both made great use of herb and spice liqueurs for subtle accents.  Since I knew we were headed this way, saved myself for the Bone Marrow.  An enormous tray arrive with 2 large marrow bones split in half and stacked.  Accoutrements were classic and perfectly matched to cut the unctuousness of the marrow (pickled onion, parsley, sea salt, capers).  We devoured the top two, they were phenomenal.  The bottom two were unfortunately cold (as much of a carnivore as I am, cold marrow is totally gross).  Also had the Devils on Horseback, jumbo Medjool dates stuffed with chorizo, wrapped with bacon and broiled.  Very tasty, touch overwhelming on the dates for me (maybe use a smaller date?).  The menu is not, shall we say, \"lite\", but hey, you didn't expect that from a place called \"Meat and Potatoes\" did you.  I can see why the place has turned heads."}
{"text":"Amazing quality food, absolutely delicious. I only wish they changed their menu up more often, I feel like I always end up getting the same thing because nothing new pops out at me. That being said, I can't complain about the steak because it's extraordinary."}
{"text":"Really good atmosphere and lively environment!! Plus the food was also very great and portion size was enough for only one person. Specially the ribs were really good and the sidings with the ribs made it more tasteful! The steak was also good and tasty! Would definitely go here again!"}
{"text":"One of my favorites downtown.   The cocktails, in whole, are pretty fantastic. Occasionally, you'll wind up with a slightly inconsistent or unorganized bartender but that certainly doesn't speak to their whole staff. Besides waiting a bit to long for a drink from time to time the service has always been on point.  The food is impeccable with large portions.   Price may detract for some, but it's about where you should expect a gastropub in a Downtown area to be.   If you're a foodie it'll fall into your regular rotation. If you're a casual diner, save it for that special night. The service and atmosphere will help set the mood."}
{"text":"The drinks were great. Tartare and steak were off the chain. Velvet cake was delicious. Definitely want to come back. Pittsburgh you rocked all around"}
{"text":"Rich, unique dishes and excellent cocktail selection. The service is outstanding!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! Whatever you do, get an item of food with bacon. I got the Pub Burger because I'm a sucker for a fried egg and was more taken with that meaty slab of bacon than the egg!   Meat & Potatoes is quite small, so be prepared to sit next to a stranger while stuffing face with meat, meat, and more meat. This is the only reason it got 4 stars instead of 5."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite brunch places. You need a reservation and it sometimes takes 2 months to get a table so reserve as soon as possible. The Bloody Mary bar is really cool! You can choose from several flavors of vodka then add a skewer full of meats, cheeses, olives, and other toppings. The chicken and waffles are one of my favorites! Don't be afraid to order something outside of your comfort zone here. They prepare everything very well. The best thing on the whole menu might be the truffle fries though!"}
{"text":"I know that I'm late to the party on this one, but I've been trying to be pescatarian for the past half year, so it's been a bit tough to come here. That being said, we break \"fast\" every now and then, and Meat and Potatoes is a great way to get your meat on. The name is actually quite fitting, because if you want veggies at all, this is not where you're going to find that - I think about 15% of their menu might include vegetables.  The pate is phenomenal, as is the bone marrow appetizer. You'll feel full just from eating that, because it is so rich. But totally worth it. I also had duck here and it was great too. Also - try the red velvet dessert. It comes in a jar, which is really fitting because you won't be able to finish it and then you can just take it home in your purse. So, evidently I have broken \"fast\" a few times. But, why am I writing only now?  Because I discovered Meat and Potatoes brunch - which is on both Saturday AND Sunday. Hear that Pittsburgh? Saturday AND Sunday. Some of you would do well to note that many of us aren't limited to brunch on Sundays!  Anyway, I've been having a fried chicken craving for the past month or so (if you've been a dedicated meat eater for most of your life, and then go pescatarian, it catches up with you sometimes) and someone told me that Meat and Potatoes does down-to-earth goodness fried chicken and waffles. Let me tell you about the last time I had chicken and waffles. It was at midnight at the Waffle Shop in East Liberty, and the fried chicken was so bad, I left it, and the waffles tasted like cardboard. But that's another story... Needless to say, this fried chicken and waffles was PHENOMENAL. The fried chicken is perfectly breaded and cooked (you can tell them if you just want dark or light meat) and the waffle is made out of this wonderful cheese-jalapeno batter that is only the slightest bit spicy. Which comes with syrup cooked with bacon.   Did you just fall over? That must be my puddle of drool you just slipped on. Sorry."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I spent our anniversary at Meat & Potatoes last night and we definitely made the right choice! We chose to split the 'Meat & Potatoes for Two,' which is a steak lover's dream! 45oz of perfectly cooked steak, truffle fries--to die for!--on the side, and a side of fried brussel sprouts later, we were both stuffed, happy, and had plenty of leftovers! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone, and will be visiting again!"}
{"text":"Love love this place every time I go to Pittsburgh this is a must stop! Their brunch is one of the best! The Bloody Mary bar is the best I've ever had!Chicken and waffles are delicious!"}
{"text":"The important stuff: the pimento grilled cheese with pepper bacon is AMAZING.  This was a very interesting place. I had heard a lot about this place, all good. Recommendation was to make reservations for dinner. But, we were going in to brunch on Saturday and decided to take a chance. The whole patio was open, but we were asked to wait 15-20 for a table or be sat at the bar. My friend and I picked the bar, and found maybe a dozen other tables empty - weird. But, I am not an expert on the seating process there so who's to say?  Staff was friendly and the bloody mary bar looked off the chains. Good spot overall."}
{"text":"The brunch lives up to the hype. The Charcuterie board includes multiple meats (duck, rabbit, etc). The chicken and waffles are ample and satisfying. The potatoes are very well seasoned. Make a reservation, it fills up fast. And the ambience / music selection is awesome!"}
{"text":"The inside is small but very trendy. The atmosphere is upscale and busy. The service was great. you should definitely get a reservation for this place. The bar is open seating but you could wait for a long time before you get a table. The food is excellent. Be prepared to spend $$$. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I really want to give this place 5 stars, but I'm having trouble. I'll try to break down my thoughts about this place, but overall, I loved it! It's a unique place and very few restaurants in the city have a similar vibe or menu.  Atmosphere: Awesome! It's right downtown and in the midst of the cultural district happenings. It's also a little dark inside, but very eclectic, with a trendy, gastropub vibe and drawings of cows (which I enjoy).  Food: Here is where I love and also a little torn. I loved what I had, but I felt like there was a bit of an identity crisis involved. The food was eclectic, but also kind of random. They are called \"meat and potatoes\" but didn't really have the menu that reflected that name. Maybe that's meant to be the irony, for which case, they did fine. For example, if you wanted just a steak (I'm not a steak person, btw), then you'd have to order the steak offering that is for 2 people. You'd think that a simple option, like steak, is what this place would own. Otherwise, the mussels for an appetizer were great and I also loved my entree (but to be honest, I don't remember what I got now).  Service: Pretty decent, although our server seemed to be in a bad mood and the others around us seemed to have a server that enjoyed what they were doing. This may have improved the experience quite a bit."}
{"text":"This was our first time traveling to Pittsburgh and we decided on this restaurant as our first stop. We had made reservations, so we had no problem getting seated right away. The place has a very cool urban/gastropub vibe with lots of interesting décor. For appetizers, we split the Devils on Horseback  (trust me. Order them.), fried brussel sprouts and the Poutine - they were all excellent. For dinner we had the pot roast, Pappardelle and the Hanger Steak. There was more than enough food to fill you up. They also have a great selection of mixed drinks. The only real complaint was the service. Our waitress was waiting on our table inside, as well as some tables outside, so she was a little elusive. And we asked a busboy at one point to check on our drinks, but he didn't seem too interested.  Other than that, a very good meal."}
{"text":"There is a lot of dimensions to this restaurant.  One being, it attracts a lot of foodies because of the new wave of food options and fanciness.  I have been here several times.  For brunch, for dinner, to sit at the bar.  Let's start with brunch...4.3 stars.  Their brunch menu is excellent if you are a foodie.  They have a lot of tasty and creative items.  Yes, they are a little fancier then my taste but they taste good.  Their dinner menu is just ok.  maybe 3.1 stars.  We went here once after a pirates game and they placed us in what could be compared as a home office.  The room felt so small.  I felt clausterfobic the entire time.   The food was just ok too.  Go somewhere else for dinner!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants I've ever been to. I'm from out of town, but come to Pittsburgh every year with my partner just to enjoy a night of wonderful drinks and food from Meat & Potatoes. Their staff are always warm and inviting, and the food is brought promptly. The cozy feel of the area around the bar and the bar itself make for a very personal experience."}
{"text":"Now open for lunch-lunch, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday!  I just had the best sloppy joe (boar meat) I have ever tasted.  No seriously, it was perfectly cooked and seasoned into a consistency that had the expected sloppy Joe sloppiness but still inspired the high end eats of this gastro-pub.  Their fries, as always, are absolute heaven.  And the service (this time we sat at the bar) was friendly, speedy, and knowledgeable.  Without a doubt an excellent experience on the service and actual food end.  Pricing was extremely good for what we ate and their welcoming atmosphere and diverse dishes make it so you want to return and try something different next time around!"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere and a great beer list. There was a wait when we arrived and we sat at the bar and ordered a Bloody Mary and a snack. The food came before the drinks, no big deal. The Bloodies were watered down Tomatoe Juice $9 each = big deal. We were never offered a table even though we put our name in. Disapointing first visit."}
{"text":"You did it again Jason! Just visited my fav spot in Pittsburgh this week...again. Love the handcrafted drinks at this place! Jason made me a Daughter Maitland, an original created by this interesting fella! When you're there ask for him & just try it..you will not be disappointed! Cecil is another mixologist that is super nice & enjoys engaging in interesting conversation! Just a great experience overall! Merry Christmas & I'll see you in Jan.!"}
{"text":"Always good food and libations. Was made to wait for 10 minutes on a reservation for 6:30. Wait staff less attentive than I would like. The food and drink bring me back, the seating and service are drawbacks."}
{"text":"I'll start off with the bad. Had to take away 1 star due to the host. She was not friendly. I came in with a friend with no reservation because there were no more available when I tried to make one online. The host took my name down and said she'd call me if there were any cancellations. So basically telling me I wasn't getting a table if no one cancelled. But she quoted another party of two that came in after me 20mins. Unacceptable. Not sure what her deal was. I asked to speak with a manager and told him the situation. He sat us right away. I wish I could remember our servers name because he went above and beyond to take care of us. I had the croque madame. I've had better but it was good. The French toast was to die for. I will fly back just for that French toast and I live in California. Overall I had an amazing experience. Great cocktails great food. I'll be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Spontaneous dinner for a party of 4! Did not make reservations, but were seated in about 10minutes at this small gastro pub which seemed to be pretty lively on a Thursday. Everyone was in a suit and tie, but probably coming after a long day of work. I was dressed very casual.  Our waiter...Alex? He was alright, his bussers were around more than him. My two friends wanted to drink wine, but me and my other friend was fine on just water. He checked both of my friends ID who were drinking than asked to check ours. I told him we wasn't drinking but he insisted he checked out IDs because it's a law blah blah. Yea I get it, but he checked my friends and she was already over the age of 25? He didn't get it until after he checked the water drinkers ID. Anyways on to the food!   Fried Brussel sprouts! Careful when you order, it was overly drenched and seasoned. Ask for another bottle of water, because you'll need it with every cringing bite. If you do order it, maybe ask for less seasoning or salt.  Fried Tots! Pretty much fries with seasoning which were good, but guess what?! It was overly seasoned and salty as well. I ordered these thinking it was tater tots. Don't make the same mistake as me haha  The Artesian cheese board! It was good! I didn't like the blue cheese, but everything else was good. I enjoyed the dates, and strawberry purée jam?   The Caesar salad was different as it had an egg, chicharonnes, and PIG EAR! I had them out the chicha, and pig ear on the side. The Caesar salad was a little bland without it, but the pig ear was different. I think I liked it haha   BONE MARROW!! Oh wow, I was expecting just one piece because in LA, you only get one, but guess what! THREE CAME OUT!! I was so shocked at such a cheap price which I think was $14? It came with capers, salt, onions, and little greens to compliment with the grilled toast. Ugh it was delicious. I couldn't finish it as I was only eating this by myself. They Togod it perfectly with the foil.  The steamed mussels with the tomato base was alright. Barely scratched the surface on that meal. It's still sitting in the fridge as you read this lol.  The Wagyu $31 was great and mouth watering compared to the MEAT FOR TWO deal. The meat for two deal consisted of a 32oz ribeye steak, frites, and a bone marrow for $72. It came out on a beastly cutting board. It looked amazing, but it wasn't. The steak was so freaking fatty. I literally was having surgery and cutting all the fat off. I never worked so hard in my life to eat a steak. There was fat EVERYWHERE! (Refer to pictures) don't get me started on the steak knife... It was comparable to a butter knife. I should of gotten two orders of the WAGYU as it was so much better. I ended up taking 3/4 of the steak home, and finishing the surgery procedure at home.   Overall, meat and potatoes were alright. Would I come back? Just maybe."}
{"text":"Next time I take a trip to Pittsburgh, I'm definitely going to also at that point take a trip to YUMTOWN.  I mean Meat & Potatoes.  I like that an ampersand is in the name of the restaurant.  (I just wanted to use that word.)  Delicious!!!!  Suuuuuuper classy fancy schmancy but dressing up is FUN!  It's in kind of a weird location, I was like, am I going into an office?  But it shares space with another establishment (I want to say...bowling alley?) and they share bathrooms too which are clean, by the by, and probably bigger than they would be if they DIDn't share the bathroom so...that worked out.    Very nice hostess, they checked my coat for me.  Not that that's like something that would separate them from the rest but, just so you know they do that.    LET'S talk about the food!  So yummy!  We were there with lots of people so we shared a bunch of stuff and we had two kinds of mussels--one curry and one regular garlic butter white wine and BOTH were wonderful.  There wasn't a yucky mussel or a gritty one in the bunch, which can totally ruin your minute or more if you aren't laid back.  The curry one was so different but soooo so so good.  Then I had the pork belly tacos and...like, seriously, they have come up in my dreams.  IN MY dreams.  I remember biting into the first one and my pupils probably dilated instantly.  I'm saying that my neurotransmitters immediately fired.  I'm saying they tasted good.  They were served with fresh lime slices and there was a teensy bit too much cilantro draped over it but I picked it off and that was easy to do so...thanks.  You obviously know that people have cilantro things and were thoughtful.    Ned insisted on ordering the meat & potatoes for 2 dish and eating it by himself.  It was...impressive and also frightening.  It was also BEAUtiful!  Huge gigantic dinosaur sized (not really) bone with marrow just glistening there in the candlelight.  I really don't like bone marrow.  Ugh.  The steak was juicy and the potato wedges were huge and the whole thing was slathered with mushrooms and onions and served on a huge cutting board.  It's the kind of steak that makes a man feel like a man.  I think.    Man, now I want those pork belly tacos again.  OK, drinks!  They make a good martini, they have a decent beer list and a good wine list too.    Back to food.  Desserts!  AHHH I'm so glad I had a little room left because jesus CHRIST the desserts were all so good and so rustic looking.  Almost all of them except the tiramisu, I think, were served in mason jars and I LOVE mason jars.  A lot.  I realize that's not necessarily a plus for the masses but they were ALSO fantastically delicious!!!  Ned had the butterscotch....something like pudding or creme brulee with no brulee.  I don't know, all I know is that it was better than mine and I hate when that happens.    Go here!  It's great!  Not too badly priced either.  Definitely going back when I blow through the Pitts.  The burgh.  The Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"ARTSY FOOD, SURROUNDINGS, AND MOOD [Warning: visitor from Florida for short vacation] Its location among all the theaters definitely brings in the goers although the clientele appears to be the under-40yo crowd (fine by me). Sunday around 4pm still resulted in a 30 minute wait.   MODERN RUSTIC VIBE With canning jars at the entrance, the flickering of 'chandeliers', as well as dark furnishings--Meat & Potatoes delivers a poshy yet rustic vibe that still fits well with this area of the 'Burgh. The outside seating is also a great place to people watch yet still tucked under the building's roof.  GET READY FOR SOME FOOD CREATIVITY The appetizers already set the mood for the ride ahead. The Strip Tartare arrived with a smoked Egg--gooey, runny Yolk--the Tartare being soft and well-seasoned against the milder crunchy Bread. Their Brisket Mac & Cheese was an explosion of comfort food but kicked up with hints of Horseradish and Potato Chips. I was also surprised at their Ceasar Salad--loaded with Cheese but enhanced with a sunny Egg on top. And yes... besides combining flavors I often don't see elsewhere (yet make sense) the food tasted great!"}
{"text":"Incredibly happening place with a great atmosphere and even better food.  We began our evening at the bar and received incredible service despite how busy it was.  The beer selection was suitable and their take on an Old Fashion with a hint of spice made itself the drink of the night.     We began with a few snacks including the devils on horseback and the wings.  My only qualm was that there were only 3 of the devils on horseback for $7.  Hard to share when you have more than 3 people.  Considering we drank most of our appetizers at the bar, we opted on just ordering entrees at that point.  All were delicious.  My red snapper was outstanding with accoutrements that possibly outshined the fish.  Other entrees such as the Hudson Valley Duck Breast was so reasonable in price considering it was an entire breast with sauerkraut pierogies for only $19.  Our dining partners raved about the hanger steak and the pasta.    The menu is so well versed, there is undoubtedly something for everyone.  The proteins were cooked perfectly but what really impressed me was the originality of the sides that accompanied the proteins.  It's funny, but the name is deceiving...they are by far more than just meat and potatoes."}
{"text":"So good!  I had one of the brunch specials - the omelet.  They were able to leave off the meat (I'm a vegetarian) with no problem.  It was delicious!  Definitely get the grilled bread - it was amazing!  Comes with fresh jam & goat butter.   Perfect post-yoga brunch - only two \"problems\" : a little pricey (although great for an occasional treat) & we had to make reservations 5 weeks in advance!"}
{"text":"I have been here three times for dinner and once for brunch. Every time I have gone has been a beyond awesome meal. I just love this place. I have had something different every time. From the soft shell blue crap sandwich to the smoked pork chop everything has always been amazing. The service has always been spot on. The interior is a modern American with a steak house feel. The drinks are well crafted and never disappointed me or who ever I have fine with. The desserts are always good. Some better then others but always good. Just keep in mind to always call and make a reservation before trying to get a table. It's always booked the day of I find. I learned that the hard way one time. Also the lunch and dinner menu do not have the same items on them so always double check that before picking a time. The only issue I have had with this place was when I walked in and they said they could seat us in an hour. An hour later we come back and that changed to 3 hours. At that point I would rather of been told that they never could of sat us. So I repeat. Always call ahead!"}
{"text":"At long last, after years of hearing about this place, I had the chance to eat a meal at Meat & Potatoes. And it didn't disappoint!  The atmosphere in here is really quite interesting - while the place definitely has the look of a modern and comfortable dining area there's lots of little inclusions in decor that make you think about shopping for fresh meat from your local butcher shop. It's kind of hard to describe and has to be seen to be understood, but rest assured, the place looks wonderful and inviting.  But let's be honest, the food is what really matters here! Meat & Potatoes is well-known for serving delicious food. And, well, they do! If you want a great appetizer, go for their grilled bread, which tastes like homemade toasty goodness, especially once you add on the fresh butter and jam that comes with it. As for the main courses, my friend had their special fish tacos (made with tilapia) and I went for a good ol' lamb burger. And yes, both were quite excellent! Something about the ingredients used in them gave what could potentially be considered standard menu fare a unique flavor. My lamb burger for instance had harrisa aioli, arugula and havarti, among other things, rather than the usual onions, American cheese slice, etc. - and the result was delicious perfection. Oh, and the burger? Cooked medium, exactly how I asked! So many places overcook my orders that having a tender, juicy, perfectly cooked burger in front of me was more or less a little piece of Heaven for me.  Not only is the food excellent here, but the service is wonderful! The waiters and waitresses are really attentive here. Have empty plates in front of you? Someone will soon clear them away. Do you have a show to go to that night? They'll make a note of that and get your order out ASAP. I really got the impression that they cared about our dining experience and it elevates Meat & Potatoes in my eyes.  So if you have such wonderful things to say, why only give this place 4 stars, I hear you asking? Well...because this place is LOUD. Like, even on a slow Wednesday night, between the loud music and the people talking here, the noises levels here got quite high. I would NEVER want to be here on a Friday or over the weekend, honestly.  Still, I'd definitely come back - the food and service really are both quite excellent. And given their prices (not super high but not cheap either) I think in my book this is a great location to keep in mind for special nights out with friends or dates. And who knows? Maybe I'll eventually find the energy to brave the noise and crowds and try their brunch - which I hear is also fabulous!"}
{"text":"This is a MUST if you are in Pittsburgh! Great ambience for cocktails, excellent choice for dinner. Extensive menu, chose the \"meat and potatoes\" for two (34 oz steak with crispy black truffle potatoes and shitake mushrooms). Meat was cooked to perfection, waitress gave us excellent recommendations on cocktails and wine list selection. It was like walking into a restaurant in NYC without the crowds.   We went on a week night without reservations, but i would call ahead if going during weekend."}
{"text":"Meat, meat, meat, meat.  Go here if you like meat.  I got the pot roast.  it was super tasty and tender.  I loved the sides that came with it.  My friends got the duck and one of the steaks.  They both raved about them both.  We even tried the bone marrow appetizer.  It was the first time I had ever tried it and I did like it.  It's definitely a little on the pricey side if you go here, but it's worth it to treat yourself to some meat if you hankering for it."}
{"text":"Wow! This place was a real treat! We went for Sunday brunch this past weekend while we were in town, and I was so impressed by this cozy spot!  First, the setting was comfy, cozy, and there was a DJ! Second (and quite possibly most importantly), the Bloody Mary bar. Now this was something unlike anything I've ever seen before. I love how you could choose from any of the infused vodkas, and make it your own! Plus, the bacon was perfection. Third, get the brisket hash. You will not be disappointed! The egg and hollandaise created a delicious sauce, which surrounded the potatoes and brisket in harmony with the spices. I really loved my meal and I wish there was a location in Indianapolis!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Hardy menu. Excellent presentation. Delicious food and beverages. I recommend the Devils on Horseback as a starter and the Meat and Potatoes For Two.   Parking was conveniently available only a block away as well."}
{"text":"We got the (I think?) ribeye for two. It's the biggest steak I've ever seen in my entire life. It tasted great. Service was good, atmosphere too. I'd definitely recommend it. Make a reservation unless, like us, you arrive late on a Sunday night."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very cool.  very nice atmosphere and the food was great.  i had short ribs..something i don't eat often and it tasted great!  appetizer...we had wings with sauce on side because the sauce was very hot!  tuna dish for appetizer also very good!!  my boyfriend loved his steak...the flavoring was fantastic!!!  the drinks were made very well..i think a place like this would do well in ny!"}
{"text":"This place was in a weird spot. We Ubered over and missed it the first time. But anyways we made a reservation and we're seating a bit after arriving.   It was just two of us and let me tell you if you don't like being in close spaces or you'd prefer to feel like you actually have privacy at you table for two this is not the spot for you. We were packed into these tiny tables with half both seating and half char seating on a curve needless to say I could have grabbed a French friend off my neighboring tables plate without much effort.   But as for the food it was good! We had fried pigs ears which were spicy sweet and tasty. Along with fried pickles which were good but not great. I ordered the salmon. Which I actually loved. It's had a fried egg, black rice, kimchi, and hot sauce. I'd definitely order it again. My fiancé got a pasta dish which he loved. And we finished with the baked French toast which was a bit disappointing but it sounded so good when described to us.   All in all not a bad experience by any means I would have just loved a bit more room and better fried pickles!"}
{"text":"Yes! Yes! and Yes!  One of the best steaks I've ever had.  Great selection of drinks and excellent environment.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"After hearing and reading raving reviews about Meat & Potatoes, I dined there expecting the best of the best.. of the best in Pittsburgh. Even though it was very tasty, it did not meet the 5-star review that I was expecting. However, I had dinner there for a work function, so I was in the back room with a round table and was away from all of the activity. For me, this took a lot away from my entire experience because I couldn't experience the atmosphere in its entirety.   Let's start with the appetizers. I tried both the fried brussels and Artisinal Cheese Board. The Artisinal Cheese Board was definitely my favorite. The display was so cool, and it was definitely great for sharing. Someone in my party loved the Bone Marrow, which I wasn't feeling brave enough to try (maybe next time?). The Waldorf salad was pretty tasty. A little bit on the bland side, and I was expecting a better presentation, but overall, I would order the salad again.   For the main course, I ordered the Wagyu Flat Iron. I order my meat medium well, and it was a little pinker than I had hoped, but it was still pretty good. And, the serving was huge! I was definitely not expecting as big of a steak...enormous actually.  Dessert...delicious. It seemed like they had seasonal offerings, and I had the gingerbread cake, which was my favorite part of the meal. Again, huge piece of cake.  Oh, and cocktails...my party seemed to enjoy what they had. The bar was hopping.  I've tried to make reservations for this place a few times and it's been booked. Book in advance, and on a Friday or Saturday night, don't expect to walk in and get a table without a reservation, especially because this place is located right in the heart of the Theater District. It's also loud, so don't expect to come here and have a peaceful, quiet dinner...I prefer atmospheres like this one though.  Overall, I would recommend Meat & Potatoes, especially because of its location. It is not your traditional place by any means.  The menu is not ginormous, but it has your fair share of unique offerings. For what they offer, the prices are what you would expect and not outrageous either. For Pittsburgh, it is definitely a place that really stands out and has a more creative, chic take on things."}
{"text":"Started off with a Sazerac at the bar.  When a cocktail is made with passion (and it's good), waiting for a table is not an issue.  Pasta, short ribs and bone marrow to name a few highlights.  I will frequent M&P, often :)"}
{"text":"I've eaten here before and enjoyed it, but this week I had the rudest service I have had in a long time. And that was at the front desk!! We arrived early and the hostess said we should come back at the right time. I asked if we could get a table (seeing it was half full) she said she would maybe get us in after 20 minutes. We went to the bar to wait and then magically there was the worst table in the restaurant (right by the door) and it was open just for us... Imagine that.  The attitude was so bad, we left and had a great nice quiet dinner at Ruth's Chris with great service.   So much for meat and potatoes. Never again."}
{"text":"Good cocktails, and good snacks. Not a huge fan of their steak or their mussels."}
{"text":"I came here for one thing, and one thing only. The Bone Marrow Appetizer was what I was after. I've never had it before and I was told that if you're going to try it, make sure you try it at a place that does it good and does it right.  And that place would be right here, at Meat and Potatoes. It was phenomenal. Delicious and cooked to perfection. Yeah, $18 is a lot for this appetizer, but how often would you have this? And, would you want to try and make it a home? No. (what does that saw look like?)  So, I came here for one dish and it was perfect!  I did look around at other meals being served and they all looked good.  The only negative is that it's very noisy. If you are coming here for a nice, quiet dinner for two, forget about it. The tables are very close together and there is no privacy. This is how I met the two ladies sitting next to me while I dined. I could hear everything they said and ended up sharing my Bone Marrow meal with them. Yes, it's dark and noisy, but the food made it all worth while."}
{"text":"Chef/owner Richard DeShantz has received a lot of accolades for this restaurant and his other nearby dining options, Butcher in the Rye, Tako, and Pork and Beans.  His menus are exciting and his food preparation is outstanding.  I can't say enough about their strong service model and romantic/laid back atmosphere.  You want to linger over your craft cocktail or seasonal draft beer just a little longer when you're dining here because it's so relaxing.  The food is exceptional.  I really wanted to try so many of the appetizers but we were running late for a show at the nearby Benedum and didn't want to feel too rushed.  Straight into the entrées then!    I had the Pappardelle pasta dish with Bolognese sauce, pancetta, pork shoulder, and garlic bread.  The noodles were delicate and perfectly cooked to just a smidge past al dente.  The flavor was really spectacular; so good that I overlooked the fact that my dish simply wasn't very warm when it arrived.  The bits of pancetta created a really delicious bite; one that I would go back for again and again.   My partner tried the Wagyu Flat Iron steak for $38 that came with charred fingerling potatoes & onions, corn pudding, avocado, and pickled peppers.  The steak was perfectly cooked and not an overwhelming cut to eat.  The sides were very nice flavor blends to accompany the steak.  The Negroni cocktail we ordered was a little too Campari forward and when we asked our waitress about it, she said that was how it normally looked color-wise so we just added a sidecar of gin to sort that out nicely.  It was such a delicious and enjoyable dinner, we are still talking about it today.  It's such a great little space in the Cultural District.  Definitely make a reservation unless you don't mind parking yourself at their bar."}
{"text":"Overall, this place rocks! This was our first time. We sat outside on the patio on a beautiful night in Pittsburgh. We could here some of the Buccos game while we were there which was awesome! I had the Three Little Pigs and my girlfriend got the Pork Mac N Cheese and the Fried Pickles. Everything was delicious, especially the sandwich with the dippy egg on top!   The only thing I will say is that I wish the hostesses were more accommodating because I originally called to make a reservation and the only time they said they could reserve was 10:15 p.m. So I didn't make it. She did tell me they accept walk ins and I figured we could just go and check it out and when we got there they had a reservation at 8:30 available, so we had to wait an hour to sit down which wasn't bad on a beautiful night. I just wish they would have told us that they offer a full food menu at the bar because it was basically empty when we got there, then we wouldn't have had to wait an hour without a reservation. My advice is call for a reservation and if it's not accommodating to your plans, you can just walk in and make a reservation which seemed to get us in there quicker than calling ahead.   But overall everything was awesome! I definitely want to go back and try some other menu items!"}
{"text":"SO DELICIOUS! We had the ribeye for two with the augratin potatoes and mushrooms with the cheese plate everything was amazing I would definitely come back highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Ok...3.5 stars, as I liked the tee shirts the staff was wearing, and comparing this place to The Butcher and the Rye (where we are last nite), the relief from all the salty food at the BatR is worth a half star :-)   Skip the Poutine unless you are a fries fan, but personally, In&Outs Animal  Style fries are 10x better.  If you must order their Poutine, ask for ketchup!  Fired Pickles were ok - the dip was especially good.  The fried batter wasn't special, but it wasn't bad.  Devils on Horseback were original and quite good!  Mac and cheese - ehh.  Again, salty, but the hint of spiciness was nice.  Caesar - I liked the ingredients, but the dressing was not subtle, just salty and ok.  It has potential to be a very good Caesar, but the dressing fails it.  At both the BatRye and M&P, throw out the salt shaker in the kitchen!  It is no excuse to flavor food with extra salt."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went for dinner last night on New Year's Eve and had less-than-stellar service.  Our appetizer took an hour to be delivered to our table, when the table next to us ordered the same thing and it was delivered in 10 mins.  I was really disappointed in my experience last night and will think twice about coming back."}
{"text":"I love the intimate setting of Meat & Potatoes. It's perfect for a date night. I visited with my husband before a show at the Benedum, which was perfect since it's so close!   LOVE the pig ears. This is the only place I've had decent pig ears above the mason-dixon.   I ended up getting a pasta dish since I was craving some comfort food that night so I can't speak to their specialties. But the papardelle was fantastic and I would order it again if we return.   They had some really intriguing menu items that I look forward to trying next time like buttermilk fried chicken livers and bone marrow. Definitely a menu that appeals to a foodie but can also please anyone since they've got burgers, sandwiches and protein entrees like salmon and chicken."}
{"text":"Just made my second trip to Meat & Potatoes for brunch and they're definitely worth the wait for a good brunch. Their chicken and waffles doesn't sound that different than something you could get almost anywhere, but the chicken is really seasoned well and there is some jalapeño in the waffles. And the French toast is also very good. Love the almond brittle they give with it as it really gives the texture of the French toast a little something different.  The only reason I don't give them a five in this review is because the service was lacking a little."}
{"text":"Came out to Pittsburgh for work and went to Meat and Potatoes.. this was a wonderful dining experience all around. Very cute unique setting, amazing food and great service. We were with a large group of people so tasted at least half of the menu.. for appetizers got their Brussels sprouts, amazing mac and cheese, fried pickles (tastes better than it sounds) and the bacon wrapped dates (must have!) also had a delicious cocktail (forget the name but friends had other ones and all of them were great)..for entrees we got a duck and flat iron steak and shared with a friend. Both entrees were fantastic, the duck was super juicy and tender and served with butternut squash pure.. the flat iron steak was served with mushrooms and potatoes. This is a great place to eat if you are ever in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Drinks are unique and strong, and the food is amazing. Go with more adventurous eaters so that they are game for the marrow. Don't miss it. My only gripe is that it's a bit dark...like people using their cell phones to read the menu dark but I guess it's a plus if your blind date turns out to be less than thrilling."}
{"text":"I visited Meat & Potatoes while on a day trip through Pittsburgh. Sadly, they were totally booked for brunch, but we made it to an early Sunday dinner.  The food was amazing. I actually preferred the starters over our main (burger). Highlights: Fried Pickles, Gin cocktail (name is escaping me), Poutine  Atmosphere was cozy and cool. The tables are a bit small and cramped, but luckily the restaurant wasn't too crowded. A great spot that I will definitely be back to if I make through Pittsburgh again any time soon!"}
{"text":"Came here on two separate occasions - once for dinner and once for drinks and appetizers. This place always seems to be packed no matter what day of the week, so be sure to make a reservation!  I highly recommend the mussels of the day! The mussels were really clean and fresh, and well-prepared; didn't have a bitterness that bad mussels can have, like at the all-you-can-eat chinese buffets (bleh!).  The poutine appetizer was a real disappointment. After having poutine for the first time earlier this year in Toronto, Canada, I was looking forward to see and try Meat & Potatoes' take on the dish. What ended up coming to the table looked more like wanna-be gourmet cheesy fries than actual poutine.   Definitely would come back for the mussels, skipping the appetizers."}
{"text":"Recently had the pleasure of experiencing Meat & Potato. Very unique old style feel and design of the restraunt facility. Although you would think this would make a romantic setting you would be mostly right. The tables are crowded close together (if you like listening into other patrons conversations this is the perfect place for you) and are extremely small. Another problem with this seating configuration (includes a large bar in the center of the restraunt ) is the noise level makes it difficult to hear your dinner companions. We ate on a Saturday night and the place was extremely crowded and noisy. Service was below par-- I suspect due to the fact that our waiter had difficulty accessing our table due to the crowded conditions. We had shared the mussel appetizer and the meat and potato \"special\" ( 36 oz ribeye with steak fries). The quality of the food could be reasonably characterized as above average but no where near outstanding. Meat & Potato had a wide variety of beer, wine and alcohol selections. We did not patronize the bar but note that it was large and seemed like a fun place to hang out (no need to be concerned with noise at the bar)."}
{"text":"Expect slow service as it gets busy during primetime hours. My wife and I tried dining here last year and ended up leaving halfway through. We chalked it up to them being new and tried them once more.   We ordered a selection of appetizers and asked the waitress to course them out. The food was okay but the dining experience was hampered by the slow service. All in all it took almost FOUR HOURS to get all our food. Lest you think we ordered everything on the menu, we ordered the following:  Mussels, Fried pickles, Poutine, Grilled Bread, Devils on Horseback, and the Bone marrow.  The food has definitely improved since our first dining experience. The mussels were very tasty, and I definitely enjoyed the poutine. The grilled bread came with a very good strawberry rubharb jam. A word of warning about the bone marrow, it is well executed but the individual bones have little in each (compared to most places that serve bone marrow).  All in all, a good dining experience if you're looking to spend the evening. If you've got a show to catch you might want to head elsewhere."}
{"text":"First let me begin by saying that this place is not worth the hype.  I came for a holiday dinner with a group of 7. It was evident that the server failed to put my order in as it came out 10 minutes later than everyone else. The noodles in my dish were not fully cooked, and the pasta dish was nothing to even rant about. If the courses are on the more expensive end, I would expect the quality of service and food to match the price tag. Unfortunately, this place does not.  If you are looking for a dinner spot downtown, there are plenty other options with much better food and less expensive."}
{"text":"This is my second stop on my Pittsburg trip. I woke up late for the first time in 2 years and decide to come to market square for lunch... Well it's brunch sink had to confirm. This place is really nice and excellent customer service. Their mimosa and mango Bellini are great. But the stand out hit was their brisket hash, wow it melts in your mouth. I suggest you order some of their toasted bread (not free) to go along. Overall a great place and really good food. So why not 5 stars?...  1. Grilled bread was super burnt on edgeds- attention to detail is important  2. Brisket prices where all fat and no meat which was a disappointment.   Besides this my bartender Will was amazing!"}
{"text":"Beautiful room and bar. Food was  just ok (from what I tried).  I shared a few things and nothing really stood out. Great bar experience though. The staff was incredibly kind and we had a lovely evening hanging before a show. I will go back again when in the area, try some other items. Lovely concept though."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, top notch service and some of the best cocktails I've had in years. Plus the food was incredible. Poutine was my personal favorite of the night, but the duck and pappardelle was phenomenal. Make sure you don't sit in the back room though, it has a very strange cold atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went here for a late dinner, since it was way past the dinner hour, we walked in, waited 1/2 hour for a table. The bone marrow is a must! Pig ear salad had fried pork skin!!! Would have given 5 stars but cannot for 2 reasons, portions are large, tables are not, and I understand the lighting sets the ambiance, but the menu is very hard to read, othe than that, Meat and Potatoes lived up to all it's hype."}
{"text":"Came here for Saturday brunch. BEST chicken and waffles I've had in my life, hands down. Such a huge serving and so tasty. Jalapeño Cheddar waffles were a brilliant use. And the bacon maple syrup? Mmmmm!  Our waitress (I think her name was Sarah) was great and helped put together an order of chicken of waffles even though they were sold out and couldn't provide the usual combo of 2 pieces dark meat and 2 pieces white meat. It's a very generous portion of chicken.  I also LOVED the Bloody Mary bar. It really is a mini buffet. It was my first ever DIY Bloody Mary. I tried the red hot chili pepper infused vodka and added some spices, sauces and pickled things and it was great. I was worried never having had many bloody Mary's in the past would lead me to mix a bad one, but it was delicious!  If I ever make it back to Pittsburgh I'm looking forward to coming back to meat & potatoes and trying the bone marrow appetizer."}
{"text":"What a great place. Amazing food, awesome bartenders. I've been now for dinner too many times to count, and have enjoyed lunches and brunches as well. Have never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"I went to Meat & Potatoes with a few friends this evening, just a few days after their opening. Here's what we ate, what we saw, and what I liked and didn't love about it:  The Drinks:  * I had the Dark & Smokey. Obviously, it didn't have quite the same taste as a classic Dark & Stormy, but it was still interesting. I probably wouldn't get it again though. * Someone else had the Old Canadian, and apparently it was amazing. * The only con I had in this category was that we were there and ordered our drinks during what I thought was happy hour (5:45), but when we got our bill, they were full-priced.  The Food:  * Curry Mussels & Frites - great. A bit spicier than those I love over at Point Brugge, but still a nice dish. The frites were good - crispy where they should have been crispy, but I wouldn't really call them frites. They're just good fries. Anyone who knows me knows that my favorite thing to eat in the entire world is fries, so I'm gonna stick to my guns on this one. Verdict: Point Brugge has the best frites in Western PA. Also, why the heck doesn't Park Bruges offer the same EXACT frites as Point Brugge? It was disappointing to come across that a few weeks back. * Poutine - good. I was hoping to learn that the curds were from the local Arsenal Cheese, but I didn't remember to ask.  * Cheese Board - great selections, every one of them. The preserves were tasty too, and the portion size is spot on. * Mac and Cheese - Lobster. Chunks. Creamy. Just right, and maybe my favorite thing we had the whole evening. * The PIG Dip - basically like a french dip, but with pork shoulder. This was my main, and it was outstanding. The bread remained crusty even after a dip or two in the au jus. It came with the frites and a tasty, crisp apple slaw.  The Interior & Branding: I'm a huge fan of pub and brasserie style interiors, so I have to say, I was almost as excited to go here for the decor as I was for the food. The style is somewhat classic and polished, but still cozy.  * Beautiful, well-equipped bar in the center of the restaurant, with a super thick, classic white marble counter and pendant-style bulbs hanging from overhead. * GREAT branding. Nice work on the letterpress, die-cut business cards and the website. FYI - the hours are at the bottom of the About page. They should be at the bottom of the Home page. * Subtle, yet luxurious tone on tone damask wallpaper. * Comfy, rich chocolate brown tufted dining chairs (I think they're from the Cafe Zao days?). * The chalkboard looks great. It's a bit hard to read from the far corner by the kitchen where we were seated, but I'm fine with that. Apparently, after the age of 30 you start to go blind even if you've had perfect vision until that point. * The only con for me was that the bathroom was not actually in the restaurant. You have to walk outside the main entrance to get to it. Not a big deal, of course.  The Staff:  * The manager came by a few times to make sure we were getting what we needed and were happy with everything. Very nice guy. * Our waitress was hilarious. Yes, she was knowledgeable about the food, but she also educated me and my friends on laser fat removal (just look it up). Priceless, especially after the meal we just had. I felt a tiny bit rushed by her, but it wasn't offensive."}
{"text":"Wonderful dinner! My fiancé and I did the \"meat & potatoes for 2\" dinner. So. Much. Food! It took about 45 min for the chef to prepare our meal, so don't go starving if you plan to get that. I felt the tables were almost on top of each other and I'm a very tight space. Be sure to make reservations!"}
{"text":"When I looked at the menu at Meat & Potatoes, I wanted absolutely everything they had to offer. Seriously, I've never had such an extensive conversation over what to order, how to order it and at which pace everything should come out. It would have been overwhelming if it wasn't so much fun.   Meat & Potatoes is regarded as one of the best, if not THE best, restaurants in Pittsburgh. It's cool, it's funky, it's got a super-talented chef with an interesting menu full of culinary delights and treasures to choose from. I love that you can go either all small plates and share everything from mussels done one of three ways to a plate of delectably roasted Brussels sprouts with a few pork belly tacos thrown in in for good measure, or sit down to a proper three- or four-course meal with superb wine and service. The menu is flexible and fun, but the food is incredibly complex and refined without being stuffy, pretentious or over your head. It is meat and potatoes, after all.   I would highly recommend making a reservation well in advance, coming with a friend or a few, having one of their marvelous cocktails and then ordering a bunch of plates that appeal to you. Then I would do it all again a few nights later so you can have all the things you weren't able to stuff in your face that first night, because like I said, you'll likely want one of everything much like I did. And everything is soooooo goooooood."}
{"text":"Wow! This place was the bomb.com!!! Everything from their truffle fries, flatbread, cool beer glasses that have the shape of a beer can, mixed drinks, and their steaks!! You just cant go wrong with this place! Definitely order anything on the menu! Its that good!"}
{"text":"Came here randomly with some friends one night. Make reservations because we didn't. We sat outside in order to get a table in a timely manner. Our waitress was not very attentive, to the point were we eventually asked the hostess to get us some drinks because our waitress literally never came back to the table other than to hand us the check. My food was mediocre at best.  My boyfriend got a burger that he found quite good. Overall experience was still pleasant considering. I doubt I would rush to go back though."}
{"text":"Great food, terrible bartenders. Only 6 people at the bar and it took 25 mins to get our tab and half the time they just stood there. No apologies nothing, someone needs to remind them who pays their checks."}
{"text":"I had dinner at this establishment and was very pleasantly pleased with the quantity and quality of the food and the outstanding service.  I ordered a pre meal drink with an appetizer plus a glass of wine with the main course.  The drink and appetizer arrived almost together, in a reasonable amount of time.  Like magic when I finished them both, the dishes and utensils  were removed and my glass of wine and main course arrive along with new utensils.  I was asked if I needed anything else only once while I ate and when it appeared that I was finished, I was asked if I wanted dessert (which I declined) or the bill.  It was like the wait person was keeping an eye on what was happening at my table and acting appropriately when it appeared I needed their services leaving me to enjoy my meal in peace.  I was not harassed with constant questions about needing something, my needs being addressed without having to ask or wait for service.  Highly recommend this establishment and if I lived in Pittsburgh would very happily come back to enjoy another meal."}
{"text":"I had been wondering about this place as I pass by it a lot, and have heard rave reviews, so was fortunate to secure a reservation the other night. Seated promptly, nice looking restaurant,  though they didn't have the heat on and it was freezing.. Heeding the warnings of other posters, I specifically asked for no added salt, and while my cassoulet was still on the salty side, it was quite good, my other dining companions had the pot roast, both agreed it was salty. They shouldn't have to hide flavor issues with too much salt. We tried the famous bone marrow appetizer.... wouldn't have that again, basically flavorless - and salty.  The service was not what one would expect for a restaurant in this price range ($140 for 3, with tip, no drinks, no dessert), just mediocre. Someone needs to focus on proper serving for a table. One should not have to ask for basic things like extra water.  My meal itself was good - not \"scream out loud this is the best place I have ever been\" - but good. Would I go back? Probably not simply due to the salt level and the poor service."}
{"text":"After heavy anticipation watching this restaurant on various food channels my hopes were high.  My date and I opted for the meat and potatoes for 2 which took about an hour to cook.The presentation was beautiful. The rib eye and bone marrow looked awesome. Now lets gets to the meat itself they claim its 45oz It very well may be but more than half was FAT. There was bone marrow was included but no bread? but bread is included in the appetizer to the couple next to us.    When the waitress came by to ask how the meal was we told her that more than half of this was inedible. She said oh would you like desert? I felt completely dismissed and disrespected,   Do not waste your time here, its a complete rip off and the staff does not care."}
{"text":"Great food, good staff.  Great place to hang out after work downtown.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Finally made it to this restaurant- Enjoyed myself- food is good- service was excellent as was my wine!"}
{"text":"Yowzers, the Sunday brunch is too fun with the DJ. You rage while you brunch, and the food presentation and quality is superb."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. Ambiance is fantastic. Just the right lighting, cool space, nice bar which is the center piece and should be because the bartenders are top notch. Drinks are not the average bottle slinging. Anything off the menu is an experience though the special was too smokey like eating a piece of wood out of the fire. However no uppity BS, she took it back and made me another.   Had the special which was the chacatuire as an app with the fried Brussel sprouts. Both were outstanding. For main course we had the special strip which was also fantastic. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because the waygu was way too fatty and not well seasoned. Dessert was phenomenal. Chocolate pecan pie and the chocolate mousse. Both of them were so good we nearly ordered another.   This place consistently delivers a great dining experience. Karen was a great waitress as well. My friend from Cincinnati repeatedly said they had nothing like it there. Props to the burgh and to meat and potatoes for bringing big city dining to our beautiful city."}
{"text":"I prefer going for brunch.  I am a big fan of their chicken and waffles, both of which are seasoned perfectly.  I think their dinner is enjoyable but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"We had no less than two people telling us this was the best restaurant in Pittsburgh, so it's a good thing it's on our way back to the hotel from the office. We stopped by at about 6pm on a Monday and was told the only tables they had were outside. We were totally OK with that, since Pittsburgh was a lot nicer than DC and the outside tables had cover over them.   We decided to get the bone marrow dish after reading so many yelp reviews, really having no idea what to expect. I've had bone marrow at home before, usually when my parents cook down huge bones for the soup base, but never at a restaurant. It's one of those things where I thought Americans don't usually eat. Anyway, the bone marrow came out with three huge bones where you can scoop out the marrow. It also came with four little toppings, pickled onion, capers, some kind of lime/cilantro mix, and another I can't remember. You use it as a spread on the toasted pieces of bread with the toppings. It was interesting. I'd say try it if you haven't, but I wouldn't order it again. It's quite heavy and fatty and oily, so you can't really eat that much, but definitely worth a try.   I ordered the lobster mac and cheese because I was planning on ordering the mussels and the waiter said the mussels had a pretty big portion, but I may still need something small on the side. Now the mac and cheese was heavenly! With a lot of lobster chunks in it! It's pretty much half lobster and half mac. So totally worth it. Then there was the mussels with the curry sauce. I can't resist mussels at a restaurant, especially when it's a curry sauce. I loved it! And it was a huge portion, even with all the shells! My coworker ordered the duck dish and it looked super good though. He really enjoyed it.   I'm so glad we got to try this place. I am kind of curious what the inside looks like. Maybe we'll get a chance to go back."}
{"text":"Hits the mark. Good food, generous portions. Try the bone marrow. Seats cradle your ass like an old Buick. Nice."}
{"text":"All I can say is FABULOUS!  The food is amazing!  Unique menu and daily specials that are always changing.  Very reasonable prices.  And a great atmosphere!  Really a great addition to Pittsburgh dining."}
{"text":"Stopped in for brunch on the last day of our fantastic long weekend trip to Pittsburgh.  Really liked the room and it was a very cool atmosphere, but our service was terrible.  Took 15 minutes for the waiter to bring our coffee, then another 40 minutes for our food to arrive.  Tables next to us ordered and finished eating in the time it took for our food to show up.  When it came, it was delicious, so with better service it would've been great."}
{"text":"great time here.  bone marrow is really good.  not as many meat options as you would think, they don't have any steaks."}
{"text":"Living in New York, I have really high expectations for food (especially brunch). So far I've been disappointed by a lot of places I've tried in Pittsburgh. Given all the great reviews, I decided to try out M&P for brunch, keeping expectations low.  We didn't have reservations on Sunday, so we showed up exactly at 10:30am when the restaurant opens. 4 groups were already ahead of us waiting for seats at the bar. Tables were not available for walk-ins. The waiting area was dimly lit with ample seating which was great! Fortunately there were plenty of seats at the bar so we only waited about 10 minutes to be seated. Honestly, I think I prefer to sit at the bar - the bar table is quite spacious, there's a place to hang my bag, and there's much more excitement going on at the bar.  The food was really hit or miss.   Brisket and egg (1/5): Super disappointed. This dish got such rave reviews on Yelp. I was expecting a Korean BBQ flavor but it was completely lacking in the brisket. The burnt edges were super dry and chewy. The brisket otherwise was so fatty both my bf and I had to spit out the fat. My bf liked the kimchi which was mixed with gochujang (I absolutely love gochujang!). It was extremely spicy so be sure you can handle it. The egg yolk was almost completely cooked and barely runny.  Grilled bread (1/5): First, my bread was burnt and dry. Second, the raspberry jam was way too sweet. I've had the best fresh jam in NY (Beth's Farm Kitchen jam), and this jam at M&P tasted like Smucker's compared to that.   Fried taters (3/5): The fries were really good, however the seasoned fries at Winghart's are much, much better. Also it seemed like our fries were from the bottom of the bag, meaning they were all short instead of the long strings you see in the photos. These fries should've never been served.  French toast (4/5): Now here's the saving grace. I am extremely picky about my french toast. I like it crispy on the outside and soft on the inside without being too eggy. I've had the best french toast of my life at ABC Kitchen and have tried it at a myriad of other restaurants in NYC. I've even been disappointed in some of the highly rated french toast dishes in NY. The french toast at M&P is absolutely delicious. It beats the banana french toast at Extra Virgin in the West Village, NY by a mile. I don't even like banana but it is delicious here. The portion is humongous. The sourdough is exquisitely caramelized on the outside and chewy on the inside (but not fluffy). The bacon almond brittle is a bonus, but I barely touched it because the french toast stands on its own. Definitely, definitely recommend this.  Regarding drinks, my bellini was also ok, but my boyfriend's diet Coke was flat!   Overall, I would definitely come back for the french toast and to try the chicken and waffles. I might even try dinner but not expect too much."}
{"text":"What a treat.  The food was superb, but we sat at the bar in front of professional bartender, Cecile.  Very entertaining and a master mixologist.  Watch him create one specialty drink after another and sample a few as well.  Very enjoyable...would highly recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"Tasty. Great apps. Decent priced food per portion. Drinks were a bit pricey. Will return."}
{"text":"Our three rating is only based on our last visit to one of our favorite restaurants in the city.  Two in our brunch party ordered the Bi Bim Bap.  When my wife started to eat her favorite dish she realized that there was no egg on top, which is an essential part of the dish, nor was there an egg the other Bi Bim Bap plate ordered at our table.  Once getting the attention of the waite staff he was shocked and apologetic about the egg being forgotten. There was a misunderstanding about both dishes not having the egg, so only one was brought out, after a little more wait the second egg came.  They didn't want their dishes to get cold nor eat an incomplete meal, so while they waited they ate some of the dish without one of the highlights. The thing that got me was the bill was full price. Now I wasn't expecting a free meal, but they could have offered us a comped drink or dessert, but nothing was offered for the inconvenience of 2 incorrect meals.  Just not what we expected from this establishment."}
{"text":"There's more seasonings on earth that salt & butter...  We went here last night for dinner.  The tables were a bit small and a little too close together for our taste.  All through dinner we had to listen to the couple next to us discussing their families and the couple on the other side asking each other questions as if they were reading from a Trivial Persuit deck- 'Do you like to get your nails done...?  Do you have any pets...?  Do you have any allergies...?  Do you have a large family...?'  It was very distracting.  The bar scene looked more to our taste but we had already ordered so we were stuck where they seated us.    We ordered the Mussels appetizer and the 'Meat & Potatoes for 2'.  The mussels were a bit confusing- some were under cooked, some were over cooked, but the majority of them were just right.  The broth they were cooked in was delicious- perfect for 'bread dipping'.  and the bread was delicious- once we sent back the garlic soaked french roll that came with it and brought out grilled sourdough.  I would suggest to anyone that comes here to request the grilled sourdough in place of the butter-logged roll.  Mussels- Pass    The Meat & Potatoes for 2 is a $59 monster 32 Ounce hunk of Ribeye with a tomahawk sized bone perched in the middle almost daring you to pick it up with 'said' bone and start knawing away like a starving caveman.  But, please resist that temptation as the napkins are small and not all that absorbant.  We ordered it Medium and it came to the table on a cutting board that required us to relinquish every other plate we had other than the about 5 inch square ones we were using to place our silverware on.  It definately looked impressive and I could feel the couples flanking us trying not to stare.    The 'frites' they served with the meat were crispy but also greasy.  It was like their oil wasn't hot enough when they dropped them, or they had been sitting around for a while half cooked and they tried to 'freshen them up' with a second 'dunking'.  They were also heavily salted to the point where it sucked all the moisture out of your mouth as you chewed them.  Potatoes- Fail.    Next was the bisected bone that was turned into a 'gravy boat of sorts' where the gravy was bone marrow seasoned with too much salt and baked with top layer of extra salted bread crumbs.  Maybe next time I'll tell them I have high blood pressure and can't have salt.  Marrow-Fail.    On to the glorious looking steak...  My first cut was delicious, although a bit salty (Do they salt the steaks when they age them?)- a nice char on the outside and delicious steak on the inside.  My second cut was very red and rare.  My wife's first cut, was red and rare, bleeding on the cutting board.  There went her appetite.  Someone doesn't know what Medium is supposed to look like... I should have been more specific when we ordered however, we have watched more than our share of cooking shows and know that medium is not supposed to bleed.  It's supposed to be brown on the outside and pink on the inside.  that's the reason we go out to eat steak- so we don't have to time it just right to get it the way we want.  If we were home with this dinosaur hindquarter I could have just tossed it back onto the grill for 3 more minutes but in this confined space and no-where to turn for assistance and my wife's appetite already blown- I chewed my second slice then asked for a 'to-go' container...  Meat- Pass... barely...   I think if we ever come back here we're going to request a larger table, order seperate entrees, be very specific with our orders, tell them EASY ON THE SALT and send back anything that doesn't taste the way it should..."}
{"text":"Just moved back to Pittsburgh after 8 years, and this was our first big \"must go\", and it was totally worthy!  Great ambiance, great service, and really great food. We had a friend in town from Chicago, and she loved it as well. The devils on horseback were my favorite item, but the bone marrow was excellent (huge portion!), as was the short rib flat bread. The drinks were pricey, but that's the norm for specialty cocktails these days. They were well made and worth it as well. The Bramble and Glenshaw Sour really stood out.   Can't wait to add this to our list of \"regulars!\""}
{"text":"Sat at bar for dinner on Monday night as I was solo. Atmosphere was very happening. Great looking bar area. Drink selection was outstanding and service was above average."}
{"text":"Came here for an event last night. They had a nice room in the back. The staff was extremely friendly and greeted us genuinely when we came in. The food was amazing as well. I would definitely recommend the fried pickles they were amazing! Also the atmosphere is something totally different that your blah basic Pittsburgh restaurant"}
{"text":"The best food I've had in a very long time...great atmosphere and service was great even though it was packed! I had the duck and it was phenomenal!  My husband had the pasta and it was equally fabulous ...my old fashioned was great! Love love love!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh, if not my all-time favorite! Most go for brunch or dinner but I actually think it's great for lunch. Portion sizes are exactly what you need. Only downfall: seating can be crammed."}
{"text":"I ate at Meat and Potatoes Sunday evening after the Pops.  We were able to get in without a reservation, if we sat on the patio.  The hostess was pleasant and our server was efficient.  My friend had the pork chop.  It was HUGE and looked very good.  My pot roast, on the other hand, was a little disappointing.  It tasted good, but it was literally 50% meat and 50% fat.  I expected a little better for the price."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing atmosphere, friendly staff. Location is beside a parking garage so access is super easy. 100% would eat here again, and we will!!"}
{"text":"There is a lot of hype here.  The question is does it deliver? I got the flat iron steak that came with potatoes and greens.  The food was spot on.  Steak was tender and the potatoes and greens had lots of flavor.  Portions were smaller than I prefer.  The tables are small and the service can be a little slow.  It doesn't match the hype, but it is still a place you should try at least once.  There are better places out there.  Rounding up from 3.5."}
{"text":"The family was excited to come to this restaurant after hearing and seeing so many great reviews.   The restaurant is very inviting and the wait staff very good and nice. We started off with a couple appetizers; fried pickles and chicken livers. The pickles were a hit. The chicken livers, not so much. The sauce for the livers didn't go well with the livers and while it may be a personal alternative taste, it's something we have liked at other establishments.   We had the oysters rockefeller, chicken sandwich and a cheeseburger for dinner. The oysters were a hit. The chicken sandwich and the cheeseburger were a miss and primarily for the same reason.  The chicken and burger both lacked seasoning.  The chicken batter was seasoned but the chicken itself while well cooked was bland. The burger was perfectly cooked but again little if any seasoning created a bland tasting burger.  We were a bit disappointed after the reviews and hype.   Pittsburgh has no lack of great food. Time to  move on to the next one and we hope that our feedback will inform small adjustments to improve the exoerienc.        The dipping sauce for the livers didn't go too well with the livers but on"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, delicious food, and great drinks.  We were in for the weekend and truly enjoyed ourselves.  Highly recommend any of their aged cocktails (e.g., Manhattan).  The high points of the night were the bone marrow and the earth-shatteringly good banh mi with pulled pork -- it was savory, sweet, and spicy... oh my!"}
{"text":"I realllyyyy wanted to give Meat & Potatoes a 4-5 star, but when it comes down to it, the service we had made me rate 3 Stars. I have been wanting to come here for years and just made it this weekend for a friend's birthday. Since it was her birthday, we made reservations for 10 in the private room in the back. This is was super fun and intimate for a group of friends- I would recommend it for a large group!   We started off with some drinks around the table. I wanted something different than I usually order, so I chose the Corpse Reviver. Highly recommended! We also started with the fried Brussels and fried pickles- both delicious! I was going back and forth between a few different items on the menu, but Chris convinced me to split the 45 oz ribeye with him.  We ordered the ribeye medium rare with the broccoli as our side and chimichuri sauce. Besides the fact that we had to send back the ribeye because it was almost completely rare, everything was so good!   The only thing disappointing was the service from our waiter. He was not friendly at all and seemed very annoyed with our group because we were chit chatting instead of looking at the menu. For as much money as we spent here, it would have been nice to have a better service experience. I look forward to coming back in the future and hopefully have a better experience."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Good drink selection. I love the outdoor setting. We shared several snacks and appetizers. The wings are good. I didn't care for the cheese plate because it had only very strong cheese like blue cheese and goat cheese. The wedge salad was very good. The blue cheese dressing was great and the tomatoes were yummy. I didn't care for the short rib flat bread everyone seems to love because again I didn't like the cheese they used on it."}
{"text":"Had a great experience. I didn't realize that reservations were pretty much the only way to get a table. We didn't get a spot until 915pm but I'm glad we still went! The decor was charming, seats were incredibly comfortable, the wait staff was kind and attentive. Food was amazing!!!! Not cheap, but worth it. Honestly the best food I've had in a while. We started with the fried Brussels sprouts as an appetizer--recommend! I got the lamb meatballs--soo flavorful I didn't want it to end. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their meals. We already can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"If you love meat, then this is the place for you! We went on a weekday around 6pm without a reservation, but were seated almost immediately. The music was definitely on point, as were the drinks! My partner and I decided to try the pig ears (delicious!) and fried brussels (not so delicious and a bit too greasy for my liking) for appetizers and then build our own meat & potatoes for two.   I know what 45 oz of liquid looks like, but 45 oz of ribeye? I was in heaven! The ribeye was cooked to perfection and the black truffle butter and chimichurri sauces were so delicious. We chose to do the au gratin potatoes and collard greens as our sides upon the recommendation of our server. I told her I am originally from the south and asked if she thought I would be happy with the greens to which she replied yes and that they were her favorite. I am sorry, but I was almost on the floor when I tasted those greens... they were sweet! I have never heard of sweet greens and I was definitely not feeling them at all. The au gratin potatoes were also a bit heavy and even though I love cheese, I would have to say these were almost too cheesy. Regardless, the ribeye and bone marrow made up for everything and we ended up just focusing on those.   Overall, I think Meat & Potatoes was pretty delicious and I would go back again, but probably not order the Meat & Potatoes for Two. Although the meat was delicious, I think other meat lovers could probably get a better fill of meat from a Brazilian steakhouse for around or less than the $75 that I paid for the Meat & Potatoes for Two."}
{"text":"I absolutely love meat and potatoes however I was really disappointed with the set up of their Sunday brunch. Typically the bar is first available. Today it was reservation only. I know brunch is busy and reservations are a must however today there were at least 5 open tables inside and 5 outside. When trying to put our name in line we were told it was a 45 minute wait. 20 minutes later the same tables were still open! When checking back with the hostess she informed us the kitchen and staff are easily overloaded and they need to set people every 15 minutes. I have never seen that restaurant that empty and not able to keep up with the demand. Oh well. We walked down to Six Penn, got right in, and had a great brunch and some Bloody Mary's. No wait and the place was packed! Enjoyed a nice time on the rooftop deck."}
{"text":"I love the food and drinks at meat and potatoes. I started going to this restaurant as soon as it opened and have been a loyal customer ever since. However, I must say the past 2 times I have been there I had the same waitress. I usually give wait staff a fair shot because I used to be a waitress, so I know it can be stressful. However, our waitress was not pleasant or friendly at all. She made us all uncomfortable with her non-friendly attitude. While the food was excellent the service needs to be improved a lot."}
{"text":"We go into Meat and Potatoes to get a table. We did not have a reservation and they said it would be about an hour wait. So we opted to sit at the bar where there were two seats available and they serve a full menu there. Jan ordered the brussel sprout appetizer .  It was absolutely delicious . I ordered the duck breast Jan ordered the black bass. The duck was well prepared and seasoned correctly. The sea bass on the other hand was overcooked and so salty Jan could hardly eat it. We will not be ordering the black bass at  Meat and Potatoes again."}
{"text":"Have only been here for brunch, but the food has been incredible. Had the stuffed french toast this last visit, and it was the best French toast I've ever eaten. Very satisfied"}
{"text":"Got a table for eight ppl and soon law school puns and drinks started rolling. We were unabashedly sharing everyone's choice of food since we all are broke students so worked great for us. I ordered the buffalo chicken poutine. Ive never had poutine so decided to pop that cherry. It turned out to be pretty good...pretty much just loaded fries  the fried pickels on the other hand were delish! The batter was yummy and the spicy ranch for dipping went perfectly with it. Perfect cheap food if you are not looking to spulrge at M&P ($5 hollaaa). Didnt fancy the fried chicken lives cuz this girl dooesnt like fried chicken livers or just chicken livers. period. My friend enjoyed them and hes a chicken liver afficiando or enthusiast...whichever seems a better fit. Another friend ordered the charred octopus which was ummm interesting. There wasnt much of an octopus on the plate (is octopus expensive?) but the plate was lovely as far as visually pleasing goes. The friend liked it so im guessing job well done. The star of the evening for me was the mushroom rissoto...wow! Mind blown - the consistency and the addition of the truffle oil was just phenomenal. Im gonna come back just for that rissoto and also jealous that i didnt order it. A couple of friends ordered desserts - all of which came in glass jars (cute concept i guess although i prefer my dessert 'not tiny'). The espresso pot de creme was my favorite. The espresso and chocolate were well-balanced out. The runner up was the apple cinnamon cheesecake parfait and the chocolate pot (or whatever it was called) was a total miss for me because it tasted like caramel and not chocolate at all. Overall, a lovely evening and would def frequent this place more often! x"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went last Friday to celebrate my birthday. We had a reservation for 9:30p. We arrived there around 9:20p and was seated in less than 10min. Which we truly appreciated because we were starving! We heard so much great things about this place that we couldn't wait to experience it ourselves! Unfortunately, we were seated right by the door that opens up to the outdoor dining. You would think that with reservations, we would, at least, get a decent seating compared to when you are just walking in without one! A staff and a customer tripped on my girlfriend's seat in the process of going out that door. Very annoying to have people walk by your table non-stop during dinner while you hope that none of them would tilt a tray of food/drinks into your heads.   When our waiter came, his name we couldn't pronounce but sounded like a foreign name (Enie, Enye or something like that), he was very standoffish. We told him that it's our first time there but he didn't seem to care. My girlfriend asked about the wine as she doesn't want anything dry but our waiter dismissed her with a \"all of our red wines are dry\" comment. Then he left to give us time to decide without offering any help or suggestions. When he came back, I told my girlfriend to pick whatever she wanted so she ordered Reisling. When our waiter came back, he didn't even look my way, talked directly to my girlfriend (btw, we could hardly understand him in the first place!) and serve her the wine to taste and approve instead of serving me first. He asked my girlfriend about what we wanted to order, still not addressing me as he should have. Was he trying to insult me? We let it pass but my girlfriend was getting upset. If it wasn't my birthday and that it was late, we probably would've walk out of there by then.  Our food came and I have to say, it was delicious! The bone marrow was what everybody said it would be and the chicken liver was great! We had the 45oz ribeye and it was perfect-- charred on the outside, pink on the inside! We enjoyed our meal despite the non-stop stream of people going in and out that door right next to my seat!  Needless to say, we enjoyed the food but not the experience. It was very disappointing considering how hard it is to get a reservation in this place. Maybe they should remove that table by the door and remind their waiters to be more friendly and polite especially to those first timers in their restaurant. We tip that waiter 20% for his rudeness. Maybe he would be nicer to others."}
{"text":"Meh. For a place called Meat and Potatoes, we were expecting...well...meat...and potatoes. The menu only has one steak and limited side choices. It seems much more geared toward drinking than eating."}
{"text":"We are in town for just one night and found this on Yelp. Portions were large and each entree was delicious. The Papardelle had the best Bolognese sauce I have ever tasted. My husband loved the crusty top on the meatloaf and my son thought the Three Little Pigs sandwich was spectacular. We would go back again for sure and recommend everyone try it."}
{"text":"This place is outstanding! Great atmosphere and the food was superb. I got the pot roast and it was fantastic. A great version of the comfort food.  For dessert we got the Pot du Chocolat (chocolate mousse) - awesome!!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty much as good as it gets.  Cool and hip dining area, prompt service, awesome beer selection and even better menu choices. You are pretty much guaranteed to have a great meal with anything you order. The last time I came here, we filled up on the appetizers and flat bread and didn't have any space for the entrees.  The meal was very reasonably price considering the quality.  Just like the other reviews say: you must try the bone marrow. Nothing beats meat butter on toast."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I traveled to Pittsburgh for a few days to explore a city we've never been to, and read that Meat & Potatoes was a must to grab some grub at. We stopped for brunch on Saturday (3/31) and it was great! My boyfriend got the grilled bread and brisket hash, and I got the \"Nashville hot\" chicken and waffles with a side of home fries. The chicken and waffles were massive! Everything was absolutely excellent! I also got a mimosa, which did not disappoint either! It was definitely full, especially being that we got there at 10:40 with reservations, and for only being open for 10 minutes, the place was pretty packed already. I suggest you make reservations, which is the advice we were given and I'm glad we listened because we wouldn't have wanted to miss out! The service was great, the atmosphere was relaxed and fun, and the DJ played the perfect brunch music. After being in the city for 5 days, we decided that out of all the places we ate at, Meat & Potatoes was our favorite!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere although tight quarters.  Food and drinks were great.  Loved the setting and the pasta dish that I got."}
{"text":"This place was really good, the perfect ending to a good trip to Pittsburgh. Things I loved: the truffle fries, all my drinks, the pappardelle, the smoked wings. Things we liked: the mac-n-cheese, the marrow (though way too much for two people).  It was crowded but the service was pretty good. It's worth a trip to this place if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Horrible establishment tried getting a table at opening and was told no we dont do large parties, i tried splitting our party and was told we dont do that. Staff was beyond rude ."}
{"text":"One of my best dining experiences in Pittsburgh. Went on a Tuesday night and despite the restaurant being packed due to a play, the hostess was extremely friendly and helpful, finding two seats at the bar for my friend and I.  The bartender was an absolute great guy and a true mixologist, once again taking the time to review the menu and drink options despite being swamped. We ordered bone marrow, the pork chop, and duck, all of which were extremely generous in portion and incredible on flavor, the service is top notch, the food is absolutely amazing, and the price is an absolute value all things considered.  Will def be going back and tell all my friends about it when they visit the burgh, kudos to everybody there, the only thing that I can see as a possible negative is the booth like seating around the restaurant, that would be annoying to be that close to other people, so I would def choose the bar if I had an option."}
{"text":"Best brunch in the area. Interesting selections and who doesn't love a Bloody Mary bar?? The Bloody Mary bar alone had 20 different items to add to your choice of infused vodkas.  I had a short rib hash that was bomb!  Also have been for happy hour for drinks and appetizers. Didn't know what to think of the bone marrow when we ordered it...I am a convert. Hard to convince my friends to try it, but OMG. It tasted like Sunday after church dinner. True comfort with a sophisticated flair. The Sgts Pepper Old Fashioned was perfect. Tasted the PBR Pimm's cup....get a driver because they go down easily."}
{"text":"Love the giant proportions of steak. I went with my girlfriends here and they loved it! We got the 35 oz steak and still hand enough leftovers for lunch the next day. Food was really good and it was a lovely night out."}
{"text":"Planned a trip to Pittsburgh from Philadelphia, and of course yelp'd a bunch of restaurants in the city. My husband and I were super excited to try their brunch menu, unfortunately it was Thursday and they only do that on weekends. A little bummed out, we were still going to try out their lunch menu because we already had our hearts set on a place. We got there, starving yet excited, only to feel extremely unwelcome by the very rude hosts. We kindly asked if there was outdoor seating available and the girl with long, black, frizzy/curly hair rolled her eyes, crumpled up the ticket that was already printed and dropped it on the desk while giving an annoyed look to the other host that was just sitting there slouching in her chair and then proceeded to walk us to the closest, probably most declined outdoor table instead of the beautiful patio on the side of the building. We didn't refuse it, we were hungry and didn't really care, we had the whole rest of the day to enjoy the city and the weather. But that experience lingered as we waited for our server, who probably didn't get told that we were sitting there. Unfortunately for our server who was pleasant and helpful, we left to find another restaurant where we would feel more welcome and get some brunch."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Good atmosphere. Been here for brunch and now dinner and would recommend to any and everyone. Food presentation is great and you get a good-sized portion. Left full and happy!"}
{"text":"I have visited Meat and Potatoes a few times for lunch. Their fried pickles have to be the best in the 'Burgh! My favorite lunch item so far has to be the burger. I don't remember the type of relish/jelly that they put on it but it's amazing! The flavor with the Cuban sandwich is also very good, but the pressed roll was too crunchy for my taste and I actually cut the roof of my mouth on it. The sweet potato wedges with the sugar coating are very good as well."}
{"text":"Just got back from a downtown b-day lunch, and alas, I have to once again confirm the 3 star rating.  Maybe I'm just missing it.  Ordered the grilled bread appetizer, which was in fact pretty tasty.  But everything else simply fell flat.  My fish tacos had no flavor whatsoever.  With Penn Ave. Fish Co. right down the road, I would have rather saved myself some dough and gotten a far better spread.  The corn tortillas were bland, the mahi had no taste, and I ended up drinking an entire pitcher of water as the lack of garnishes left them dry as a 20 year old sponge.  I did have half of my wife's wild boar sloppy joe, which while significantly better than the tacos, didn't really impress.  I far more enjoyed the house pickles on the side of the plate.  While I'd go back if someone wanted to, I don't think I'll find myself venturing on my own in the future.  Judging by the reviews, I feel like I'm missing something, but then again, maybe it's all the hype."}
{"text":"The bone marrow was really delicious - albeit just a tad bit over-salted in my personal opinion but still really good and worth getting! They give you a huge helping and its enough for 2-3 people.  In addition, the mussels are amazing. They come in a different variety of sauces and are soaked with flavor and have no 'fishy' taste as I've experienced with other mussels/seafood of this variety.  The atmosphere is very classy and refined but still hip and fun to be in. They have late night burger and food specials that are extremely cheap and reasonable despite being a high end resteraunt."}
{"text":"Their salmon dish is not be missed. One of the most eclectic mix of flavors I have had in a while. The place is a bit noisy but otherwise good atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is probably the only bar in Pittsburgh that can make a proper Last Word, not to mention that they have a couple of barrel-aged cocktails on the menu (Manhattan, Negroni).  Nice program, wasn't expecting to find that out here.    However, a bartender took my order and then proceeded to never serve it up.  I eventually just took my seat at the table when the party arrived.  Seriously, how hard is it to serve up a barrel-aged cocktail? -1 star.  Food wise, here's what we tried:  - Kobe Corn Dog (Solid) - Chorizo / Pulled Pork Mac-n-Cheese - Pub Burger (The menu here is confusing as it says pork belly pastrami, when really they just meant thick sliced bacon... come on guys let's stop watching so many episodes of Mad Men) - Korean Reuben - Fish-n-Chips (fried skate)  The burgers, sandwiches, and fish and chips were all great, but damn the portions were big.  If Jon Taffer ever came to this place he would say that the food costs are probably out of control.  An upscale place like this should be serving share plates like sliders, not giant deli sandwiches.  I can't complain about them for giving lots of food to us, it may be that they have to do that to compete for local business for all I know.  Just saying that I would have preferred more small plate options."}
{"text":"I was here just a few weeks ago with my boyfriend and his family for a birthday dinner. We were seated in a semi private room just off of the bar area which brought in a lot of noise.  Most people started off with some appetizers, flat breads and poutine to share. Then came the main meals. I got the Soft Shell Crab Club and it was excellent! Cooked to perfection with fries on the side. Others in our group ordered the roast beef which looked amazing.  The atmosphere is great and it's right on Penn Avenue which allows for a lot of interesting people watching.  Biggest complaint would be the size of the room and the noise, made conversations across the table a bit difficult."}
{"text":"M&P has a great brunch selection.  We had the shrimp and grits and the huevos rancheros which were both awesome.  I'd recommend this place for brunch on a lazy Saturday or Sunday!!!"}
{"text":"This. Place. Is. That. Deal! I walked in and truffles were in the air. C'mon you know it has to be good. My group planned on eating apps and entrées but we were not the soldiers we thought we were. We should have only got apps because they were delicious and the portion sizes were surprisingly large. We have truffle fries (amazing), wings, fried pickles, and Brussels sprouts. All were really good. We should.have stopped there. Then I ordered the steak. Wasn't the biggest fan of the cook but it wasn't bad. All elements on the plate were great and the service was awesome. If you're in town I would definitely try this spot out!"}
{"text":"Great menus items with the best bar in the city. Blake makes the most amazing cocktails - including the obscure stuff no one else knows. The bone marrow appetizer and desserts are delicious. We go many times just for drinks before or after a show."}
{"text":"We went to celebrate my son's 13th birthday. My husband and son had the ribeye for two, and it was exceptional!! I had a burger and my daughter got the wings. Everything was great. Our server took care of us, never leaving a drink half filled. I can't say enough. We had a wonderful evening at M&P!!"}
{"text":"A 5 Star brunch review!  Here we go!  Background: Long time fan of M&P - In fact, its my favorite High End Gastropub eatery that is in PGH! A tall feat considering all of the mouth watering options around town! This amazing trip was a surprise from my friends who had set this up in part for me before I leave town. Considering I had just been at a wedding the night before, It was probably one of the few things that got me up and ready to go when I was told in the morning!  Seating: We had a reservation for noon and I was pleased to find out that we were placed in the private room that is immediately to your left when you enter the bar/dining room.   Menu: The Brunch menu is not expansive but it doesn't have to be like that anyway. Everything on the menu is done to a high level and you can tell when all the food comes out.   Dish: I went with the Bi Bim Bap: (skirt steak / black fried rice / pickled cucumbers / carrots / korean hot sauce / sunny side up egg) and it was Amazing! The flavors paired well and it was a good amount of food.   LIBATIONS: I started with some coffee that was good, not great. No worries though since my mimosa was on point! Smooth and delicious! Lastly, I got the Jefferson's Quill: (bulleit bourbon / strawberry hibiscus / lemon / mint / bitters) which was also very good. I tried several Bloody Mary's which all had great toppings (grape leaves, stuffed mini peppers, dill brussel sprouts) and different juices and infused vodkas!!!    Service: Our waiter was very good. He gave recommendations, was attentive, brought our food and drinks out on time. All in all, he did a good job with a large group.   Check out brunch here at least once! I'll be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Waited 40 minutes for a table in the back room.  We were a bit disappointed after passing through the swanky bar, but after having our meal, it doesn't matter where you sit, the food is great!"}
{"text":"The service and food is top notch!! We were early and our reservation through yelp was ready and we were seated promptly."}
{"text":"A fun, hip, young adult locale with good food.  It's a bit cramped though with a bar in the middle and slightly louder music.    Wife and I split the charcuterie and corndog as appetizers.  I was surprised by the amount of meat you get!  Kobe corndog was also good with the wasabi mayo.  For entree we split the lamb burger which was my first time having lamb as a burger. It was good juicy and had a really good sauce.  Overall it was a good place and I can see it being fun to go for drinks and hanging out with friends.  Reason for not five stars was although it was good, it didn't completely wow me."}
{"text":"Make sure you make your reservation thru Yelp!  Someone we were with, called and couldn't get reservations but I was able to book a table for us with the Yelp reservations with no problem!!"}
{"text":"I'm not gonna lie this is kind of pricey. But I come here often. I come for brunch on Sundays and their bloody Mary is amazing. Also I come here during night time and get their toast and goat butter. That is so ridiculously good. The bone marrow is good but it is pretty fatty. The macaroni and cheese is really good as well. All their food is pretty fantastic even their drinks."}
{"text":"Best brunch in Pittsburgh. My friend took advantage of the Bloody Mary bar as was blown away. You have four vodka choices, and then you add the toppings of your choice, such as fresh asparagus, celery, mushrooms, garlic, and multiple choices of hot sauce. There are plenty of breakfast cocktail options as well, and they are quite creative. I had a champagne cocktail with elderberry liqueur. Delish!  My friend had the omelette special that came with their signature au gratin potatoes. They were outstanding. I had the short rib hash, and I would go back again and again for that dish. The eggs were perfectly poached, and the short ribs literally melted in my mouth.  I love the atmosphere. Rustic with lots of wrought iron, yet modern. I can't wait to come back and try their signature chicken and waffles. I kept watching that dish go buy and my mouth kept watering even though I was already stuffed!  Our waitress was just ok, but honestly, I didn't even care because the food was so good."}
{"text":"While looking for a restaurant that's open on Sunday night, we remembered that we had not yet had dinner here, so made a quick reservation (a must) and made our way to the Cultural District (not Squirrel Hill, as it erroneously says here on Yelp). My first impression was positive, as I like the decor and look of the place, with its high ceilings, plush velvet banquet seating and streamlined, Steampunk vibe; kind of butchery meets 19th century cafe. The bar is in the center of the room, and it was lively, even on a Sunday evening. Service was prompt and helpful, and we decided to each have the caesar salad and share some apps. The caesar here is non traditional and delicious, with both cracklins and chicharron standing in for croutons, pickled green tomatoes adding zest and a fried egg on top for richness. This is a fantastic salad, considerably more hefty than the original version with all of the protein and fried elements, but playful and surprisingly well balanced. We shared the fried chicken livers, the ahi tuna taquitos, and a special of the night, pork belly with mole, corn esquites and pickled cabbage. The fried chicken livers were delicious...perfectly cooked and served with a rather spicy dipping sauce. The ahi taquitos were good too, and provided a little relief from the richness of the other two dishes. They feature ahi ceviche stuffed into tiny hard taco shells and topped with cilantro and a yummy drizzle of their sauce. These are spicy and rather addictive. The special was excellent. They achieved succulent perfection in the preparation of their pork belly, which the server told us was braised, but which had a lovely caramelized exterior, so perhaps it was finished under the salamander. The fat had not been rendered away, and was meltingly soft. A decadent indulgence. I am sometimes loath to order mole at any restaurant, as I'm so often disappointed, but their's was very good, not too sweet and not overly spicy. The pickled cabbage provided a nice counterpoint to the full bodied pork and sauce, and the corn was delicious. Overall, excellent food served in a fun atmosphere. This is not everyday food for me, as I treasure my arteries, but you can order fish here, and you don't have to eat fried food, beef or pork belly to have a good meal. The drink menu is interesting and not overly pricey, and the wine list is well thought out. I'll be returning."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the most popular spots in the city, so make sure you get reservations way ahead of time. The place is much smaller than you expect. The ambiance is great. I recommend the bone marrow appetizer and the salmon (it's Asian inspired and the flavors all work really well together!) Very pricey though."}
{"text":"Visited the area from OC California and we were glad our concierge recommended this restaurant. The food was great, service decent, and this quaint local restaurant didn't have that greasy hole in the wall feel that most restaurants in this region have. This is a must do if you're visiting. We came here for brunch and the French toast was amazing. I'd definitely recommend making reservations."}
{"text":"Yup,  still awesome.  Their drink menu still rocks, satisfying all of my boardwalk empire cocktail re-enactments. This time it was a marvelous rye whiskey and laphroig concoction with a large dose of citrus. I think the citrus might have overpowered the smokiness in the whiskey bev, but either way it was still awesome.  We all shared some devils on horseback (must eat bacon wrapped figs, nom!), and some wagyu beef sashimi (double nom).  My main course was the duck with chimichurri (what a fun word, perhaps my first born son will be named chimichurri). It was very good, and did not have the typical fatty-gamey flavor of duck and had a more roast beef consistency.   My girlfriend ordered the lamb roast and, whew, that was a hit. She continues to perpetually make superior orders to mine.   M  and P is still one of the best restaurants in the 412."}
{"text":"I came here to eat with my friend, there was just 2 of us. We asked to sit outside and the host gave a look like it was a crazy request. (probably because it was slightly busy and we did not have a reservation) They sat us down at a table that was barely big enough for one person let alone two. I got the Ahi Tuna to start and it was very good. I got the short rib flatbread and was not impressed. My friend got a burger with egg on it and it looked good. All in all i thought it was okay and would probably return but will demand a full table and pass on the flatbreads."}
{"text":"We ordered the poutine as a starter and the meat and potatoes as our main entree.  Everything was delicious.   If I lived in Pittsburgh I would definitely go back.  FYI...They were pretty busy on a Thursday night. We had an 8:30 reservation and the entire dinner took close to two hours."}
{"text":"I've been to Meat & Potatoes twice for brunch. As the name suggests I would recommend getting some meat related dishes if you are visiting. The brunch items I have tried so far have been satisfying, but just a little off the mark for me in terms of flavor. Although everything I've tried has a strong (salty?) flavor, I've also felt a little underwhelmed and craving a more complex/less bland flavoring. Also when I ordered the brisket hash I found the portion to be a little small (however I was right off a plane and very hungry, so that might have had to do with it). Overall I would still say that every dish I've tried has been solid and my experiences there have been happy. I have heard that dinner is phenomenal, so I would love to go back to try that!  PS: When I was seated outside on the marble tables I found that the table combined with the unique dishware and eggs made my meal very instagrammable, if you care about that."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the lobster mac n cheese tremendously. There was a lot of lobster in it. The flat bread was very good also"}
{"text":"Not being a big fan of meat or their very popular \"meat butter\" aka bone marrow, I do hear this is AMAZING!  I personally enjoy the mushroom flatbread and have gone to the Sunday brunch on several occasions.  I do think this restaurant has one of the best, if not the best atmosphere in the city.  The lighting is great, sets a very cozy tone and I also like that overflow can sit in the cozy little sitting area in the lobby (and order food and drinks).  Cecil is a fantastic bartender and really enjoys the craft of making cocktails."}
{"text":"Really, really delicious.  Reasonably priced, hearty meals and great atmosphere.  The skirt steak was great but the risotto it came with was maybe even better than the steak.  But the pork, holy cow.  Basically tasted like a giant piece of bacon, but with even better bacon on top.  Delicious!!"}
{"text":"The duck breast was fantastic and the beef ribeye for two was also great. I didn't like the seasoning on the fries and the Brussel sprouts were delicious. The area inside is pretty small so don't expect tables larger than four and there are plenty of bar seats."}
{"text":"Just got back from Meat and Potatoes, and as I'm sitting here typing this review all I can think about is how I desperately want to go back, sit at the bar, and try everything.  Honestly, I can't think of one bad thing about this establishment as of yet. The look and feel of the restaurant is very modern and classic at the same time.  Their cocktails are inspiring and delicious. I went with the Gin Richard which consists of superb quality Blue Coat Gin, lime, lemon, soda, and some delightful rosemary that really accentuates the drink. My friend had the Old Canadian, which is by far the best bourbon concoction I've ever tasted, and not to mention gorgeous to look at and hold in your hand. It's almost a crime to consume these beverages. It's as if God himself wanted all of the Meat and Potatoes patrons to observe their beautiful and luscious nature.  Food wise, I delved upon the Bone Marrow appetizer, having never tried bone marrow before, and I must say that  I was in awe of its simplistic presentation. Three huge pieces of bone marrow, some delicious, baked break, and some tasty spices, such as capers, to add to the overall taste and experience.   I loved Meat and Potatoes and can't wait to go back. Do yourself a favor and go."}
{"text":"Hungry for carnivorous creations, we decided we should check out what Meat & Potatoes had to offer our gastrointestinal system.  Since I am a follower of the Paleo way of eating, anything with Meat in the name is A-okay with me!  My friends will tell you that they automatically know and should always assume that if my carnivorous cravings are not quelled they and fellow tablemates will not be appeased with my behavior.    Sooo..here we go!  We asked for options from our foodie friend aka hotel concierge and he also suggested Meat & Potatoes.  Ok, so now that are minds and GI systems are in sync we head out into the blustery Pittsburgh evening.  Our driver told us mid-drive that he heard they turn people away all the time and reservations were definitely suggested.  Since this was a grim possibility, eeek on a Monday in downtown Pittsburgh, who would've thought.  So, we called, and low and behold a 2 hour wait for a table.  We decided to show up and no space at the bar to gussy up to either, fail.  We asked about bar options from the young hostesses, I mean, they're young, they should know what bars are good around their place of business.  They suggested a place a block away, it was closed.  Seriously?   Apparently, after checking further with my handy dandy Yelp app, I came to the conclusion that Pittsburgh is a ghost town on Monday, does no one eat on Mondays??  Is there some secret cult thing here where everyone starves on Monday nights and businesses decided to give all their much needed restaurant business to one restaurant?!  We remembered there was a bar right beyond the entrance to the illustrious M&P's so we decided to check out the show selection and bar.  Much to our fancy they had a FREE show of cabaret singers and a bar!!!  SCORE!!! or GOAALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL whichever suits your desires.    We got our free tixs, a few drinks and got a front row table of a packed house and enjoyed the libations until our table opened up.  The service was great until we waited over 45 minutes for 1 plate, yes 1 plate, to come out of the kitchen.  Every table was full, but these weren't plates that anyone slaved over all day.  These meals definitely didn't take 45 minutes to prepare.  We had a hanger steak (7 slices) over german potato salad and a few brussel sprout leaves.  Honestly, I've prepared meals more indepth in less time.  The waiter noticed the concerned, I'm about to go all King Kong in here if I don't eat something soon look on my face the 14th time he passed our table.  He came over and chimed in with \"Oh, we overcooked your steak so it's being redone\"...ummm ok, could you maybe have told me that 30 minutes ago and 2 liters of water ago?!  Our dinner was delish when it finally arrived and $32 later we paid the check and vacated our table.    The hanger steak was tender, juicy and seasoned appropriately.  Most places tend to under season steak and the chef's had a great handle on this.  The german potato salad 'dressing' was tangy, sour, creamy and touched every inch of my palate sending RED ALERT morse code signals to my synapses.  The crispness of the brussel sprouts leaves interspersed throughout the dish were appropriate and provided not only color but another texture to round out the dish.  Presentation was clean and crisp and visually appealing on a long rectangular plate with the slices of hanger steak displayed proudly atop the creamy fingerling potatoes like Tiffany diamonds on display in a sparkly glass case.  I whole heartedly believe in my dining experience starting with a beautiful and aritistic visual display of what is about to happen gastronomically.  It's like porn but better, satiated for a lot longer!  M & P hits all of your senses with muted overall lighting with hints of beautiful dim white twinkles here and there.  The 2 tops are a little strange, cramped if you decided to hang onto your app and start on your entree.  I kept kicking my companion under the table, honestly, I wasn't doing it on purpose this time!    M & P is definitely worth a reservation, make sure you follow this simple step people or you may find yourself out in the cold bitter Pittsburgh evening without a full tummy and cold nose!"}
{"text":"Meat & Potatoes, the name says it all!  So after catching a review for this on the food network a year ago I have been going crazy wanting to go here and try the \"Meat on a plate with potatoes for 2\" haha.  So first off let me say this, this place is small, but very nice! The waiting area has very comfortable couches and the waitstaff are amazing.  The seats at the table are tall-back chairs that are quite possibly the most comfortable chairs I've ever sat in, after our meal I just wanted to take a nap in the chair.  Anyways onto the food and staff.  Our waiter was awesome, very attentive and left a bottle of water at the table. I love this and wish more places did this. Being able to serve ourselves more water and having you replace the entire bottle is the best idea, wish more restaurants would do this. He had great suggestions, knew how things tasted on the menu and really made our night.  The food.  Well obviously we had the steak for two with steak frites and bone marrow. The steak was HUGE, enough for 3 people!!! It was not only cooked perfect but the flavors were out of this world. It was tender, juicy and was perfectly seasoned.  The steak frites were huge and tasted great but the winner here was the marrow. I LOVE bone marrow. This is like the food from heaven. I love spreading it on bread, or in this case, my fries!  We ordered a few sides including the poutine and fried pickles. So the \"Snacks\" are as big as appetizers but come at half the price. The poutine was perfect. The fries were crunchy and salty, the gravy very meaty and the cheese curds were actual curds! They did in fact squeak on your teeth haha. The poutine was exactly as I hoped it would be.  The fried pickles are chips, but they are THICK and I mean THICK. The pickle itself had an amazing pickling, I'm not quite sure what they used but it was great!  Overall this place exceeded my expectations and the next time I'm in Pittsburgh I am definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, very good service (probably from all the negative reviews so far about the service element) and OMG the food. I got the Bone marrow appetizer and then the Wagyu Flat iron. Although Ill need a decent workout to burn off 1/100th of this meal, I enjoyed it! I think the bone marrow is a once in a lifetime dish because of how decadent it is. But i loved everything about my flat iron. Cooked perfect, correct portion size! One thing I would change was the pickled carrots that came with it. I didnt love it all that much... YAY!"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try Meat and Potatoes for weekend brunch since we have enjoyed dinner and drinks before.  We were not disappointed.  Their brunch menu is unique with great twists on eggs, waffles and french toast.  My short rids and hash with poached eggs was a very hearty start to the day and the french toast had a great mix of sweetness with banana AND bacon brittle!  Add a Bloody Mary made with bacon infused vodka and enjoy!"}
{"text":"We waited for 1/2 hour at this place, definitely worth the wait. The food was amazing and service was excellent. The steak was very good, I recommend to have the steak with the black truffle butter."}
{"text":"One of my favorite parts of traveling for work is trying out restaurants in different cities.  This one was one I was looking forward to.  The restaurant is dark and sexy inside.   The food was good, but somewhat simple considering the beauty of the restaurant.  It is upscale gastro pub food.  I tried the taters with black truffle mayo.  Pretty basic comfort food.  Nothing really special about it.  There home cut fries are good to look at, but not as tasty as they look.  I tried a hot dog with foie gras.  The intent was good, but hot doug's in Chicago does it better.  The bone marrow was really good, meaty and decadent.  The decor and food are beautiful, but the menu doesn't measure up to the price when compared to other restaurants nationally."}
{"text":"Marrow and crispy Brussels are a meal in themselves, and we almost canceled the burgers.  Wow, that wouldve been a mistake!  I luckily found my 2nd stomach... mussels were also good.   gin Richard, and  crimson tide were both really nice cocktails!"}
{"text":"The Captain and I came to Pittsburgh for a weekend on official MOH duties and, naturally, I turned to Yelp to discover what restaurants awaited us. Meat and Potatoes was the most reviewed restaurant AND half a mile from our hotel so this seemed like the obvious place to go.  The restaurant is nice inside - it has this hipster butcher vibe going on. It's unfortunate that it was just the Captain and myself because there were a lot of items on the menu I'd have liked to try. But alas, we could only order what our stomachs could handle. I went with the bone marrow appetizer and the Captain got the mussels. The bone marrow was well prepared and, if I may say, a rather large portion. Of course, this was probably meant to be shared but ... my fat ass ate it all. The portion comes with 3 pieces, about 6 slices of grilled bread, and is accompanied with gremolata, pickled onions, capers, and salt flakes. Don't shy away from this menu item (unless you're on a diet ... and I should be).  For my entree I selected the duck served with spaetzel. What a disappointment. I ordered it medium rare and it arrived as such but it tasted like ... nothing. Bland, dull ... completely void of anything that would make me pause to appreciate its flavor. My husband got the wagyu flat iron steak which he said was \"just ok.\" A little curious as to how neither dish was served with potatoes. I mean, that's the name of the restaurant, right? Meat and potatoes?  Anyway, desserts were just parfaits in various flavors, served in small jars. Perhaps our expectations were too high or perhaps the restaurant is overhyped. Either way, I'd suggest making a meal out of appetizers - the entrees disappoint."}
{"text":"Really solid place. Great ambiance and pretty good service. Food is outstanding, highly recommend the \"meat and potatoes for 2\". A great deal and some of the best steak you will have. The potatoes are without a doubt the best take on french fries I've ever had. The bone marrow was amazing too. Great cocktail list too, or so I'm told. Certainly a must-try!"}
{"text":"First thing, food was aight. But nothing to do somersaults for. However our waitress needed to go back to Remedial Waitressing 001. I asked for a cappuccino-- We don't have that. Fine. I asked for coffee with milk-- We don't have milk. OK. My husband asked for tea-- We don't have tea then later retracted her statement. Hmm. Omelet of the day-- We don't have that. Damn, what the eff am I doing here! OK honey what do you actually have to drink-- OJ, . Great! I'll take that!  Please let me know what you DO have, instead of what you don't. It will help my imagination of this restaurant to actually have things to drink and eat. yikes!"}
{"text":"Not a lot of options for vegetarians. I understand it may be obvious given the name of the restaurant, but I always like to have options.  We were able to get a table for two here on a busy Saturday night (they are near the theater district) so that was a big plus. They have a back room that has additional seating that we were placed on. Not impressed that they first seated is on the table closest to the door that the waiter would have to pass close by every time and though there were plenty of other free tables we had to ask to be moved. Back room is also smoky from the kitchen.  As a vegetarian I had the grilled bread (delicious with yummy butter with sea salt) and the Brussel sprouts (shredded to unrecognizable and very salty).  Overall not a very memorable dinner for the price. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Brunch was very generous.  I consider each 'entree' big enough for two people...and I'm an eater =).   I had Brisket and Eggs (Korean BBQ) and I forget what H had.  But I made him order a bloody mary so I can snack on items on the Bloody Mary bar while we waited.  He found the bloody mary (beets version) just okay.  The food was rich, delicious.  It was so rich that we found it difficult to finish both our meals - rare!  The atmosphere is great, decor reeks of rustic elegance.  Also had dinner here one time.  Had short ribs flatbread and Hudson Valley Duck Breast.  They had to switch it to some other type of duck that was even more tender, but the duck just melts in your mouth.  Again, the food was so rich, that it was hard to have so much.  I was really tempted by the mussels, but the only non-pork flavor they had was curry, and I wasn't in the mood for curry that night. Will try to post pics soon! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Menu is really limited. The prices are just too high for what you get! The music is ridiculously loud. They are not really customer focused as they are busy. But, a repeat customer I will not be."}
{"text":"I used to frequent MP often when it first opened. Then I realized I didn't actually like it, so why was I going there so much? I felt the food was salty and not quite my style. However, when I purchased a gift card at an auction it felt like a great time to revisit. I'm so glad I did. Jonathan D & I ventured out to MP for our first post-baby solo dinner on a rainy Sunday evening. We shared an order of brussel sprouts and grilled bread and, for our entrees, the duck and pot roast. Everything was so exquisite it almost defies description. The brussel sprouts arrived in an odd paper cup, but had the flavor a top-notch presentation. The grilled bread was delicious as always and our entrees could not have been any better. Jonathan enjoyed his duck immensely and my pot roast is the best I've ever had, and fed me for two days. We were both in the mood for dessert but the very small dessert menu didn't offer anything we were interested in on that particular evening, but that's okay. I still think the menu items are a little too heavy on the salt but, in general, it seems as though the food has actually improved as MP's time in Theater Square has gone on. I'm ready to return again ASAP!"}
{"text":"I have to say that I am a little disappointed with Meat & Potatoes. The service was very good, no complaints there. The decor was nice and very welcoming. That's where they get their 3 stars.  The food is something that I would never come back for.  Tried the pigs ears and bone marrow. Both were only eaten by myself at the table. The other guests refused to eat them after the first bite.  Out of the Cobb salad, Pork, and pub burger the table decided the pub burger was the best. We then spoke on the fact that this place is so popular and hard to get reservations we found it hard to understand why...  I don't meant to be negative but I just wished there had been a review on here that warned me for what we got so I could've made a differ decision."}
{"text":"Our family had dinner here before a Pirates game last night.  We had been looking forward to eating here after reading many positive reviews.  The service was excellent and the drinks were good.  Our kids both had Mac & Cheese with the pulled pork (no chorizo) and it was ok, but too much cheese for the mac, and the pork did not work well with it.  My husband had the Korean Reuben, and he said it was way too salty, as were the fries.  He also said the pungency of the kimchee overwhelmed the sandwich, and he couldn't taste any of the other flavors.  I had the fish and chips and they were awesome.  The fish was skate, and it was really delicious - lightly breaded and fried, but not greasy.  The taste of the fish dominated, and that was a good thing.  The chips followed the theme of being too salty.  Overall, it was disappointing."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant while visiting the Burgh with a few other people. We sat outside which was nice since inside it is a little on the loud side but I believe the restaurant is set-up that way which is fine. They had a good beer selection. We started out with the cheese plate and the wild boar sloppy joe. Both were awesome and actually when we finished the apps we were not really hungry for our meals but we plowed through. The best thing of the group was the steak which was excellent. The fish and the pork chop were good but not as good as the steak. I had a pasta dish with a bunch of meat in it that I thought was pretty good. We were way to fill for dessert but overall I thought for the money it was very good."}
{"text":"My dreams have been dashed.   I have this theory about resturants that the later in the evening the worse off the service, the cooks/ wait staff are more tired I'm more tired...that's my  way of rationalizing poor service.   I ordered fried chicken livers and the mac and cheese I nibbled on these bits while sipping on a beer at the bar.    I then ordered the three little pigs to go.  The bar tender took my food away and boxed it up, then another waiter came with a bag that had my to go sandwhich in it.    I asked, \"Is all my food in here\"? He said \"yes\".  So I paid and left .   Well well well when I got home  only the sandwhich was in the box.  I always do the bag check when dining at say Wendys ...but I didn't think I would have to do a bag check at Meat and Potatoes. What a let down I wanted to finish my mac and cheese.  The buddy waiter/bartender system they have at the bar is confusing and I must say I don't like it.   The Mac and Cheese was so yummy too with smokey pulled pork through out. Gosh I wish I had checked that darn bag for the rest of my food lol."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Saturday with my mom, around 12:45 PM. We were greeted quickly and asked if we had a reservation (we did not). The host hemmed and hawed and then said we could sit at the bar or in a quieter off room since the restaurant was full for reservations. We chose the quieter room. The server did a great job of making sure we weren't forgotten back there, especially since the only other party who were back there with us left about 10 minutes after we arrived. But the room was weird, like a converted break room they added for events/large parties. It didn't match the decor of the main dinning area, and it never filled up. The restaurant closes from 2-5, so I'm not sure why we had to sit in the back room, as the main dining area never filled up either, but I digress. Unbeknownst to me, M&P was still serving brunch at that time we arrived, which was unfortunate, as we really wanted more of the lunch portion of brunch, which was a little lackluster on the menu. My mom ended up ordering the brisket and eggs, and I got the Pittsburg cheesesteak. Both entrees came out promptly, and were very flavorful and hot! The waiter was prompt and checked on us a couple of times, which I appreciated, since we weren't in anyone's line of sight being in the strange room. At the end of my meal, I inquired about the bathroom, which was another strange ordeal. You need to leave the restaurant completely and walk to the theater area to use the restroom. It's very odd and a bit convoluted, as I was told to leave the restaurant and it'll be there immediately on my left.   Bottom line: if I lived here, I'd try their dinner menu. I wouldn't be inspired enough to come back and try brunch, and I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend them to my friends who may come to visit Pittsburgh. Also, these guys aren't on Open Table. Never even thought to make a reservation via Yelp, so I'd suggest to them to make it easier for patrons to be prepared."}
{"text":"Absinthe and fried chicken. I vote yes. More like, oh hell yes!  I came in on business, Pittsburgh is a really nice town. I'm a native Chicagoan, where I expect my cities cramped and unfriendly and dirty. I was shocked by how much breathing room I had here.  Meat & Potatoes has a spread of crazy stuff on the menu, and I go in on daring dining. They have a slate of absinthe, including original recipe European imports, on the menu. Score! They do it up as a cocktail in the traditional way. Less green and halluciniatory than I had imagined, but what a fun experience :D  The actual meat of Meat and Potatoes was spot on. I had \"Pickled Chicken\" which is probably the worst name for a fried chicken sandwich I've ever heard. It is, however, pickled, so a logical name, but it really is a classic, mildly spicy fried chicken sandwhich. The breading is crispy, the chicken tender, Top notch experience all around."}
{"text":"I love this place for Brunch. The food is always delicious and I always have trouble deciding what to eat! It is a little pricey but I believe you do get what you pay for.  My only gripe is how incredibly hard it is to get a table. I think having over two weeks in advance for a table is a little crazy."}
{"text":"So happy I found this place on my transfer through, on the Amtrak.  The fried chicken livers are my new favorite thing.  My mom made chicken livers all the time and they weren't bad.  She was good at making them tender but hers, I'm sorry to say, weren't nearly as sublime as these.  The lamb shank was delicious too, with a unique seasoning and a perfect preparation.  Beyond that?  The punch I ordered was a very good drink.  All in all, an excellent, 5-star experience.  Oh yeah, and then there was the excellent wine recommendation.  I never thought I'd utter the words, \"can I have some more of that delicious California Pinot?\"  Especially after having been in both Burgundy and Willamette within the last 6 months.  As I sat there on my way to Chicago from New York, I decided, based on the atmosphere and the food, that maybe Pittsburgh is the gateway to the Midwest; closer in style to Chicago than to New York."}
{"text":"We had heard about this place from many people so we decided to go and try it out ourselves. The very first impression when we walked in the restaurant was great. The environment and ambiance were amazing. The place has a nice atmosphere that prepares you for the food experience to come. Service is nice, fast and helpful. Everything we tried was great and I have to recommend the three pigs sandwich. Also the plates we saw in other tables seemed delicious as well. We will definitely visit this place again and I am highly recommending it!"}
{"text":"If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck & looks like a duck, then it's duck so please send it to Meat and Potatoes promptly as I will be over to eat it shortly.  Just thinking about it gets me all quacked up.  First time there but definitely not our last trip to M&P.    We arranged reservations almost 2 weeks in advance and when we arrived the waiting area was packed with other reservation holders so reservations are a must.  I did see a table or two that was not occupied during our early dinner but I chuck that up to the hours we were dining, 5pm on a Saturday.  Well it worked out perfect since we were coming from an afternoon show.  I studied the menu for two weeks looking it over and over and wondering what I would order.  I had thought of the fried pickles as these are one of my favorites, or the pork belly taco's because come on pork belly in a taco!  Yum, but no.  My recent love affair with duck had me swooning for it...  I also saw so many wonderful pictures of the bone marrow I had to give that a shot too.  I can say confidently that I picked wisely.  This was one of the best meals I have had in a long time.  As I looked to my H who I convinced to order the Wagyu, I stated, \"Welcome to my new favorite restaurant\".  He absolutely loved the wagya, he said I wish there was just one more piece of it.  I think he could have had two... Lucky for me my plate filled me and though I could have eaten more I didn't have to, the portion was perfect.  I could've done without the pierogies.   I love pierogies but this one wasn't my thing.  All is fine I gladly gave them to my H to eat and he happily did so.  The atmosphere here seems casual with an upscale feel at the same time and the seats were like sitting on your overstuffed couch.  I melted in.  I will be back M&P you really got all your ducks in a row."}
{"text":"I love the ambience of this restaurant. Great selection of alcohol and great bartenders. Food is excellent, always love going here."}
{"text":"Excellent as always! I took out of town guests here and we ordered the namesake dish, \"the meat and potatoes\" and we weren't disappointed. The drinks were made well and the service was attentive."}
{"text":"We went here for my fiance's birthday. I called ahead and she asked me if we were there for any special occasion. I told her yes, for a birthday, and asked if they do anything special. The girl on the phone laughed and said no, \"you have to pay for dessert\". I wasn't looking for free food, but was hoping for a special table, candle, etc. Otherwise, why did she bother to ask?  We got there and the waitress offered me a drink (my fiance was parking the car). She read me the draft beers and offered to come back to take a drink order. We were seated at a small, wobbly table for 2. It was so small, that it couldn't fit our entire order on it, and the waitress told us she had to \"map out\" how to deliver our food, so that it could all fit on the table.   Once my fiance was seated, we ordered the curry mussels. They were fantastic. I could almost drink the broth alone without the mussels.They were seasoned with red curry, what tasted like cilantro, and had a little bite to the aftertaste. We then ordered fried pickles (amazing breading, not too thick, and didn't fall off), devils on horseback (dates stuffed with sausage wrapped in bacon with a sweet red pepper sauce. Definitely more sweet than we imagined), and poutine (cheese curd was good on them).   My fiance decided on the lamb burger. It was delicious and juicy. It had a good lamb flavor and the bread was fresh and didn't tear. There was some sort of sauce on the burger, which was had good depth of flavor. It came with fries; the fries were fries. Nothing out of this world, but tasty.  I decided on the mushroom risotto. It was perfect. Flavors were delicious and the texture was creamy. It was a small plate and I was full, but not so full that I couldn't move, which usually happens when I eat here. It was a good portion size.  We weren't impressed with the desserts. We were looking for something light, and all they had was chocolate. The \"lightest\" thing they had, was some type of orange creamcicle dessert, and neither of us are fans. They change the desserts daily, so I was unable to order what I had last time I was there, and loved. To be honest, it was disappointing that we did not have dessert, given that we were there to celebrate a birthday. It would be nice if they had some type of standard dessert to accommodate several different pallets, that way everyone leaves happy.  All in all, it was great food, friendly service, and a good environment. Make sure to call ahead, though. They fill up fast, even during the week."}
{"text":"March 7, 2014. Decided Meat & Potatoes was the place for us to have a birthday celebration dinner. We arrived a tad early for our 7:45 reservation. We were pleasantly surprised when we were seated right away despite the place being packed with theater going crowd. We were only a group of two, lol.   Waiter poured some water right away & took our drink order. Our bottle of wine took some time to arrive. But the place was packed & the staff was constantly moving.   We ordered some fried pickles for fun but I can tell you the menu is packed with an array of appetizers, drinks & mussels of the day! Pickles were delicious & the dipping sauce had a lovely zing to it.   We were seated in the bar area at these tiny two people tables among others coming & going. After an extraordinarily long wait & noticing people coming in after us were getting their meals we were about to ask about our meals when the waiter came to us & told us he took it upon himself to involve his manager & insist on our meals to be made immediately. He apologized. We were fine with that result but if we had theater tickets or other plans we would have been hard press to have stayed & been able to enjoy our meals. I think the wine helped in this situation not to get annoyed.   The best part of the night other then the amazing chocolate dessert & having dinner with my great friend was the lovely friendly couple next to us. The tables are so close together it's impossible not to acknowledge your dinner mates. That made the evening fun & extra special to meet friendly native Pittsburghians!   Note: I enjoyed the game hen with green bean casserole & a scrumptious cranberry stuffing & lovely chicken gravy. The chicken was moist & nicely seasoned. Wish there was a roll or fresh bread to sop up all that gravy!   My friend enjoyed the fish & chips. Lightly battered. Served with fresh greens & smashed peas (my friend absolutely went nuts over the smashed peas & wish she had a small bowl of them) all drizzled with a light malt vinegar. There was a side of their home made tarter sauce.   We shared an amazing chocolate mousse dessert with fresh whipped cream!   All in all we had a nice experience. It was loud & very active. Not a place for a romantic dinner for two but definitely a place to go with friends. If going on theater night allow plenty of time to enjoy your meal or eat at home & enjoy drinks & appetizers or dessert here. Food is delicious & plenty. I didn't pay since it was my birthday but my friend was pleasantly surprised at the bill thinking it would be higher with the quality of food. She would put it at moderately priced to high depending on what you ordered. I would agree with her based on the prices. You can eat well here and spend little or spend a lot.   I say go. Give it a try & decide for yourself!  :-)"}
{"text":"PBLT - pastrami belly on a BLT. Even better than it sounds; the arugula complements the fatty meat well. And the bread (thick cut) is excellent."}
{"text":"This was my first taste of Pittsburgh, and I was not disappointed. I had the Pierogi, and it was out of this world. I'd recommend making a reservation in advance, but the host got us in without a wait. I'd chalk that one up to perfect timing."}
{"text":"We made a late night reservation because they are supposed to have the best burger in Pennsylvania. We almost walked out because the service was very slow. Once our waiter remembered us everything was great. The pub burger was excellent, a great poutine as well. Nice wine selection. Our waiter was great, I'm sure he was in the weeds. It was packed, even late at night. Reservations recommended."}
{"text":"I've had a couple co workers tell me this place is great. Man they weren't kidding. I loved everything about it. It was easy to make the reservation (which I highly recommend doing). The staff was so friendly when we arrived. We were seated right away. The atmosphere was definitely something different in a good way. We ordered the fried pickles as a snack while we waited for our main course to come out. We decided on the Meat & Potatoes for two. IT WAS HUGE. The meat was tender and cooked to perfection. We will definitely be returning here!"}
{"text":"I truly think Meat & Potatoes is worth the hype. I've never had a bad meal or experience here! It's been around for a while so it might not have the new and exciting vibe as some of the other spots, but there's a reason it gets rave reviews. They do a great job.  I've gone for dinner and lunch (when they were open during lent) and everything has been delicious. My favorite thing to get is mussels, but even just a regular old burger is awesome here. You can go as fancy or casual as you'd like with the menu, and their cocktail list is awesome. Service is always attentive without being overbearing. Even with other new and trendy places popping up around town, I keep coming back here."}
{"text":"My husband and I had an amazing meal at meat and potatoes! The service was fantastic, the food was delicious- we had the pig ears (tasted like bacon), bone marrow appetizer (amazing), the pimento burger and another type of burger, and the oreo brownie! Everything was fantastic! The only con is that the seats are very close together so we didn't have a super private experience. However, i cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Been itching to try this place out for a long time now but I always have a huge party and waited too late to make the reservation.  This place is small and pretty tight but since we had a larger party, we got a private room! It's dimly lit and very hipster.  We got fries and wings as appetizers and they were both amazing. Wings weren't too hot and I've never had better fries in my life! I personally got the three little piggy sandwich and it was the best out of everyone else's meal. It's more like a yummy breakfast sandwich with s runny egg, thick cut bacon, and ham. It also came with fries. I loved it! The others at my table got a variety of different items. Two people got the shortbreads and two others got sandwiches. Everything looked amazing. If I were in the mood for this type of food, I would go back!"}
{"text":"Meat & Potatoes is always somewhere I feel like I need to go because of the hype surrounding it, but I never really have a strong urge to be here based on a non-noteworthy experience I had a few years ago.  In any event, I wanted to wrap up my birthday weekend with brunch at M&P because I hadn't been here yet for that and I've been told they have the best bloody mary in Pittsburgh.  Our food was great. Our bloody mary's were just...alright.  Our service was...meh.  I love the atmosphere of Meat and Potatoes. It is not a huge space but they do utilize it well and make the most out of it with the seating. I definitely recommend a reservation no matter what you're coming here for, otherwise there will be a wait.  It is bright and they had a DJ spinning real vinyls which was cool. It was very relaxed and vibe-y and their menu, though limited to brunch, is extensive in the sense that you can order breakfast or more lunch-type of items.  We started with the truffle fries and bloody marys. I got the bacon infused vodka for mine and my date had the horseradish vodka.  We braved the crowd to go to the bar to do the add-ins.  Mine was okay - not the best and not the worst.  The truffle fries were to die for.  I ordered the huevos rancheros for my meal and my date had the brisket hash.  The food came out piping hot and the flavor was really good.  The huevos rancheros were insanely spicy. Too intense for me almost.   Our waiter was not really  engaging us at all. He showed up when he had to, took our orders and brought out the food. It wasn't bad service, but it wasn't that good either. Which is disappointing, because M&P is a really nice place and the end bill reflects the atmosphere and the quality of food, so I wish the overall service/experience matched.  Regardless, I'd come here again because their menu is interesting and you know you're going to eat a satisfying meal."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Meat & Potatoes, this time for Sunday Brunch.  This visit didn't disappoint.  My husband and I spent the weekend in Pittsburgh for Valentine's Day.  I made a reservation through Yelp, which was helpful, because the restaurant was fairly busy.  Seating is always a bit tight and awkward, but that's ok.  We were seated and ordered coffee, which was fresh, hot and satisfying.  I ordered the special lemon ricotta pancakes and peppered bacon.  My husband ordered the traditional breakfast, housemade sausage, eggs, potatoes and toast.  The pancakes were DIVINE, topped with the most delicious lemon curd.  The peppered bacon was tasty too.  My husband enjoyed his breakfast as well, but wished that he had ordered the signature chicken and waffles, once he saw the surrounding table's orders arrive.  Also the Bloody Mary bar was pretty popular.  All-in-all, this was a great choice and we would absolutely return."}
{"text":"We loved it. The charcuterie board very good. The 34oz ribeye with fries  and bone marrow fabulous! Can't  wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Fun, lively atmosphere! Amazing cocktails, meatloaf and burgers. Best meal while in Pittsburgh and I had some good meals!!"}
{"text":"Best restaurant experience in Pittsburgh! Food is delightful, and not too expensive either. The bone marrow and the duck liver pate are delicious. My wife had the wild mushroom risotto and was in heaven.   Extra points for a super friendly staff, and the manager of the restaurant comp-ing us 2 free desserts just because we complimented him on the food.   Everything was amazing!"}
{"text":"First time to Meat and Potatoes restaurant and we will go back. My husband and I had the fried pickles, the salmon, and the pork and blue cheese flatbread. I am not a fan of fried pickles but said I would try one-I ended up having more. Our server asked if we were attending a show that evening and we were. Our meal was served in a timely manner."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for drinks. The service is awesome, but their food is hit or miss. We ordered the chicken liver, beef tartare, risotto and meatloaf, which is on their special of the day menu.  The risotto and the chicken liver were good. The rest are horrible because they came out extremely salty."}
{"text":"Only negative thing I can say is that I hate the name.  The old Amy wouldn't even go to the bar because of the name, but I'm glad that I'm always evolving.  Really awesome cocktails, and you can tell that they don't skimp on ingredients or presentation.    Have been here twice for cocktails, and last night we added food.  Unfortunately the Manhattans made me lose my ability to recall what we ate at the bar.  Cute and friendly bartenders!  Highly recommend for night out on the town in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Rather excellent place. Came in 30 minutes prior to our reservation and sat at the bar. Cocktails were very good. Were seated later at our table in the main area, which is very lively and stylish, very well suited for a relaxed conversation. Great atmosphere!   The food was VERY good. The meat was prepared really well. I had pork belly tacos and hubby had bone-in filet, both cooked to perfection, followed by dessert served in a glass jar. Servers were polite and attentive.   The only downside was that the filet (that was on special and was not listed in the menu) turned out to cost almost twice as much as the most expensive item on the regular menu, a small thing that our server \"forgot\" to mention. Even though my husband thoroughly enjoyed it and would have ordered it anyway, it would have been nice to mention it in advance, as you don't generally expect a price of $56/entree in a place that has $20-25/entrees in their menu. Hence minus one star.   Otherwise it was a wonderful evening and we will come back. But please, do mention the price next time!"}
{"text":"BRUNCH REVIEW  Pros: Great food Reasonable prices Great service  Bloody Mary bar  Mehs: Parking costs (up to $8) Reservations need to be made more than a week in advance   Cons: I spent some time thinking about some cons, but there really aren't any. This is an excellent choice for brunch!  We've gone here for brunch a few times, and have always had a mouth-watering meal with great service. For the delectable food you get, the price is outstanding, and you will quickly get hooked on the experience. A meal for two, including coffee and Bloody Marys, comes to slightly under $50."}
{"text":"This is a fun place in a great location in the Cultural District.  The food is very good, and the decor is charming.  The service is fairly quick, and the wait staff is very polite and helpful.  I was surprised at the devils on horseback, which turned out to be a very delicious appetizer...and something I was not expecting at a place called \"Meat and Potatoes.\"  I have heard people rave about the good food here, and it turns out to be very good and there are some fun choices, however it's certainly not the best Pittsburgh has to offer."}
{"text":"Holy cow (or pig?)! This place is amazing! The atmosphere is quite hip, the food is astounding, the music selection is perfect, and the seating is probably the most comfortable restaurant seating I have ever experienced. I ordered the wagyu steak as my entree and our starters were the fried pickles, fried taters, and cheese board. It was legitimately all amazing. There are several parking garages nearby, so parking is a breeze. I will be back! This has definitely become a staple of my trips back to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"It is a very quaint atmosphere. It's very nice for the bar and the service was excellent. We had the mack and cheese appetizer which was delicious and we also had the fried pickles which were also very good.  I had the pot roast and was delicious and fell apart with A fork.  I suggest you call ahead for reservations because getting a table will be very tight during dinner hours. I still have to say I think it's one of the better or best restaurants in the downtown area"}
{"text":"Food and service was excellent.  Just very close seating arrangements.  We might as well have been sitting with the people beside us.  But otherwise, very good."}
{"text":"great food (recommend the Pappardelle) and cocktails (order a Suburban) and reasonably priced (less than $20 / plate typically)"}
{"text":"I would love to recommend this restaurant, but I cannot.  Let's start on a positive note - the atmosphere is nice.  They did a nice job decorating.  The tables are a bit close, but they didn't have much space to work with...nice job.  The wine was just fine too.  The food, on the other hand, was not good at all.  First, the menu is extremely limited.  Second, we ordered the gnocci and the pork.  The gnocci was mushy and soggy.  It was not very flavorful.  The best part of the pasta dish was the garlic toast.  We also ordered the pork.  It was fatty and tough.  It is served with an apple slaw that has a strange mixture of flavors - not very good.  The menu indicates that the meal comes with baked beans.  In reality, it is just a spoonful of beans on top of the pork.  The beans were the best part of the meal, so it was disappointing that there wasn't really even one serving on the plate.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"It's a splurge and you certainly are going to need a reservation (we booked right here on Yelp and it worked perfectly!), but the portions are huge and the food is perfectly seasoned! Boyfriend noticed there was no salt and pepper on the table, but when the food came (quickly!) we suddenly understood why! I had the pork - a HUGE portion! - and boyfriend had a smaller portioned chicken entree. (I forgot to take a pic until I was already done eating as much as I could of my pork!) The buffalo Mac and cheese was spicy - boyfriend enjoyed it more than me because I'm a spice wimp - but I can understand why people like it so much! It was the perfect date Night spot - even if a little pricey, still delicious and worth a little more coin!"}
{"text":"I had the Pork. The chop was the best that I ever had. It was perfectly cooked. I ordered it medium well. The knife, however was dull. They need to update their cutlery. The collard greens were indeed sweet. My drink was the Diablo. It is now my favorite next to the Moscow Mule."}
{"text":"Probably a 4.5, only because I wasnt thrilled with my Old Fashioned and I thought the menu was a tad minimal...would have liked have seen 2-3 more entrees (I am not a hanger steak or flat iron guy...give me traditional cuts. I also saw short ribs on other items, would have liked to see a short rib entree)...I am having a hard time deciding on 4 or 5 stars....I think it is really close to 5, but a couple small things, like the drink, the pastrami (see below) and a friend saying the steak was a ittle tough are making me  go 4 instead of 5. But honestly, this was probably the best sit down meal I had all week in this town and wouldnt hesitate to suggest you try it.   We had a group of 8, so we started with a bunch of the small plates, or whatever they call them. The Fried Pickles...oh my....I am not a huge fried pickle person, but if everywhere that has them made them like this, I would be. Best. Fried. Pickles. Ever! The Poutine...being from the west coast, I had no idea what this was. But I am now a fan. Very tasty. The grilled bread...meh...it was fine, but not exciting to me, but a buddy with me said it was his favorite.  The Brussel were also very tasty. Im not usually a Brussel guy, but it was outstanding. I wanted to love the corn dog....it was good, dont get me wrong, but it just wasnt as exciting as I was hoping for. It was solid though.  The bone marrow....wow...what can I say? It was extravagant, decadent, rich, buttery goodness. And my buddy that lives in town said his dog loved the bones...  Soooo...I had the pork chop....holy crap was that thing huge! It was very moist and tender with a nice smoky flavor. The apple salw had a nice little kick to it, and the cool spicy crunch of the slaw with the tender smokey-ness of the pork and the sweetness of the beans was a great combo. The only thing I felt that came up short was the pastrami. It was just this really fatty piece of limp meat that didnt have much contributing in the flavor dept and wasnt the best texture, to me. Overall, the dish was a big win though.   I really enjoyed this place and would like to give it a 4.5....if you are looking at yelp trying to decide where to go in Pittsburgh, this is the place...I just wished I had more time there to try more of their menu (like lunch...the sandwiches and burgers sounded great). I think it is really close to 5 stars, it was just a couple really small things that cant let me do it (btw- I hate when people give good reviews, but not 5 stars and dont explain why)"}
{"text":"I can't review the food here but am disappointed in the service I received because I made reservations for 7 people a week in advance for a Thursday night dinner. We showed up to the restaurant with 1 more person and they told us they couldn't accommodate our party until at least 1030 when it was only 730. We told them we would squeeze the other person in and didn't mind if it was tight but they told us no and to try Six Penn down the street. Not very good customer service in my opinion, so 2 stars."}
{"text":"This was my second experience here and for the second time I was not too crazy about the food. However both times that I went it was later in the evening (2 hours before closing) so I don't know if that had something to do with it. On a brighter note I will say that the atmosphere was cool and my drinks were well made and flavorful. Outside of stopping by to grab a few drinks...I probably wouldn't eat here again."}
{"text":"We went on Saturday June 7 at 11 am.  We asked to sit outside.  The hostess said it would be a 30 minute wait.  We then asked about a seat at the bar.  They said sure.  The bar was empty since they just opened.  We waited ten minutes. We asked about the empty bar seats and they said it would be thirty minutes!  Why didn't they tell us at the beginning?  The 3 hostesses were disorganized and not friendly at all.  We left,  unhappy with the hostess staff.  They do not represent the restauant well at all."}
{"text":"Very disappointed! This is definitely one of the hottest restaurant in town. Every time we try to make an reservation, it was either fully booked, or no table available until 10pm! This place has been getting great reviews, which it made us even more curious to try it out and also raised our expectation. Last week, we made reservation a week before and got in at 5. The decoration was nice but different than I imagined. The stuff were friendly and nice.   Now the meals, Of course we have to order bone marrows. It is one of the reason we want to come, they serve something that others don't have. However! It was just like eating fat, on a toast. Hard no for this. Pig ears, deep fried, the sauce was very sour. Pickle was Good  tho. No to the pig ears. Pork chops- urgh.. no, stoped after two bites, I've had better. Salad-again, some thing you can do much better at home by yourself Burgh was good  Over all, everything was good but the food. I don't know why people loves this place so much, but it is not for me. I might give it another try if it is not so hard to get in. Since I have to book it a week ahead, i Would rather go somewhere I really like and enjoy. We almost had our rehearsal dinner here, but they don't have a room big enough can host the party. Now I'm glad we landed some where else."}
{"text":"Fantastic joint located in the Cultural District of Pittsburgh's Downtown area. I admit, I'm surprised that I put off coming to this place for so long. My friend and I ended up splitting a Meat & Potatoes for Two ($69), which included a 34 oz. ribeye steak meat cooked medium rare, confit steak fries, mushroom ragu, homemade steak sauce, and bone marrow gratin. I also ended up getting a devils on horseback as a small plate. Let's start with the main entree ... the steak meat for the ribeye was dope. Not only very tender, but also very flavorful especially with the homemade steak sauce, which gave the meat a more tangy flavor. Quantity of meat was abundant and even for two, it took my friend and I the entire meal to eat all that meat up. The confit steak fries were also not your average steak fries ... not soggy, but very crisp and tasty with seasoning (much appreciated). The bone marrow tasted like fat ... not sure if this is how it should taste (as this is the first time I've ever had anything like it), but it was very interesting indeed and I used it to coat a few of the steak fries that I ate. The mushroom ragu was great. Fresh, firm, and flavorful. The devils on horseback was tasty ... came in a small tray and I only got three. Not sure if the price on it was justified, but the taste was good. In general, a great place to go. Just go hungry and ready to eat meat!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance but the tables seemed small and crowded once we got our entrees. The mussels of the day were delicious! The poutine, however, felt like it was... missing something? It tasted great, don't get me wrong, but the ratio of gravy/cheese curds/fries seemed off. I still enjoyed it though. The salty pig flatbread was very good as well. Our waiter mistakenly gave me cold coffee after our meal but noticed the error before giving it to me and replaced it immediately. All of the food here is hearty and there is so much of it you'll probably end up boxing your leftovers to bring home."}
{"text":"Cool restaurant. Came for brunch while on a short trip to Pittsburgh. My BF loved their create your own Bloody Mary Bar. I ordered the chicken and waffles which was a huge plate of chicken, enough for feed at least 2 people. BF ordered the bibimbop which was a disappointment, he should have known not to order a Korean dish at a non-Korean resto! Recommend sticking to the more traditional menu items."}
{"text":"I know you can't go wrong with fried chicken but this chicken was different. Absolutely amazing.  My husband had the chicken paillard and it was amazing too!"}
{"text":"This brunch Bloody Mary bar is to die for. Just a note, get there earlier if you want the entire experience because they do run out of toppings as the brunch goes on. The French toast is mind blowing, as was the pancake of the day. The more savory dishes were good but not amazing, which is why I'm taking off a star."}
{"text":"This place was amazing for brunch!! The drinks were awesome, the food was delicious and the music was on point. I highly recommend for brunch."}
{"text":"Loved this place.  The environment was so fun and the staff was great! We had the 45 oz ribeye and it was so delicious! I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Excellent excellent excellent. Went for the brunch and ordered the chicken and waffles. One of the best breakfasts I have ever had, hands down. The amount of food for the price is stellar. Massive cheddar jalapeño pepper waffle with four huge pieces of chicken and bacon maple syrup. Start with truffle potatoes!!! MAKE A RESERVATION AND GET OVER HERE TO EAT NOW."}
{"text":"My wife and I had the build your own MEAT & Potatoes for Two 45oz. RIBEYE for $75. We had see in on a Travel network show and it looked so good. How disappointing! The tasted of the steak was not bad but about 1/3 was fat. For $75 a better cut of meat should be served. The bone marrow was not all that special and that was what the Travel channel made a big deal of. Save your money and pass on Meat and Potatoes."}
{"text":"The bar is a fantastic place to hang. The bartenders are the best in the 'Burgh! Mai, Greta, Blake, Jason are all fantastic. The drinks are delicious and the food is out if this world. Truly all-around fantastic place. Love it here!! I recommend the Devils on Horseback, mussels, short ribs, chicken livers, and the burger. All are awesome choices."}
{"text":"Had dinner here this past Saturday night.  Was wowed from start to finish, was greeted right away and sat for our 8:00PM Reservation.  Had an extremely knowledgeable waitress named Rachel that made fantastic recommendations based on the true preparation of the dishes.  There was too much that we wanted to try on their far from ordinary menu, full of interesting dishes.  We went with the Beef tartar appetizer which was so fantastic, smooth, flavorful and the delicious egg topped it off perfectly.  We also tried the tuna taquitas which were great as well.  The Fried Pickles are a must have, the breading is incredible but they are huge.  For entrees we enjoyed the Moules Frites with White Wine Garlic Broth, which the girlfriend said where some of the best she ever had.  I enjoyed their signature duck dish, this was such fresh meat but what really made it for me was the pastrami edging.  The sauerkraut pierogoies were a nice side of the dish aswell.  Dont miss out on their drinks, this was the best Manhattan cocktail ive ever had!  Also enjoyed a drink called the Perfect Sour, that was a great addition similar to a Pisco Sour.  Will be returning soon with plenty of options to try !"}
{"text":"Delicious lunch-time fare was the consensus of the group, and with large portions, almost everyone in my party of 6 (was was excellently cared for by staff) took home leftovers to look forward to. My turkey melt was the best I'd ever had, the bloody marys were generous and enjoyed by everyone at the table (Even Scottie who claims to not like them!). ** Reservations recommended, ESPECIALLY FOR PARTIES OVER 5, AND WELL IN ADVANCE! It's not a huge place, and after dining there with family, I can see how it would be hard to merge any open tables to fit more than that at a time with smaller reservations also waiting  But, if you're a smaller party, even if you have to wait, the food, drink and service will be well worth it.**"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh.  The best Moscow Mule I've had in Pittsburgh,  My girlfriend and I got Meat and Potatoes for two, and we were so sad that we couldn't quite finish it because it was so good.  Must haves: Bone Marrow (ask for extra bread) Moscow Mule Cheese Board Mussels And if you're lucky enough to be there on a day when they have it : Softshell crab sandwich.  I think the only thing I've ever had here that I thought was lacking was a charcuterie, it was expensive, and just plain lacking in substance.  But one experience like that is not nearly enough to knock off even half a star for me when it comes to Meat & Potatoes."}
{"text":"Being from the South, I had to try the fried pickles! They were different than I was used to and my colleague had never tried them. They were not the thin sliced pickle chips, but rather like mini fried green tomatoes! They were fresh and tasty. The wait staff was very responsive and answered all of our questions. We didn't recognize all of the items that went with everything. The portions are huge, so come hungry! I ordered the pork chop and it was enough to feed 2 people. My colleague ordered the half BBQ chicken and it fed 3 people! Everything was fresh and the patio was nice!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Great service, wonderful food, delicious drinks. Make sure to get a reservation way in advance because they are usually booked solid!   I had the pork chops, and it is enough for 3 meals! The collard greens that came with it are amazing (I'm currently trying to figure out the recipe!). I highly recommend this restaurant, and cannot wait to go back! If I can ever get a reservation...."}
{"text":"See my review for Tako.  Again, this crew does three things right each time: Ambience (their best feature, and to be honest much needed in this beautiful city), bold flavors (hence this review), and a good blend of inherent Pittsburgh with outside flavors. Oh and a fourth: Some of the best drinks I have had, PERIOD.  Now, hailing from NYC and being a child of the world, I think my palette has evolved to the point where gut feelings mean more than just Borbyrigmi (that's what Google is here for people)...but now food gives me that instant gratification and \"light bulb.\"  Before I proceed, I will say this. They have the best burger I have had in Pittsburgh, period (yes, it even beat you Tessaro's). More on that later.  Now, none of the above makes me any more special than the next person to judge food, but I think my take is authentic. With Tako, they did it well. With Butcher, they did well for what it is supposed to be.  I wish I could say the same for M&P. Why the 3 stars? Consistency man, consistency. My first experience was fantastic. Meat and Potatoes for two and good lord I wanted another round but I couldn't keep dessert waiting. My second time there, the meat was slightly dry, less juicy, and the potatoes weren't well seasoned and I just couldn't stand it. The Brussels were delicious, the tots were seasoned well, but good god that meat and potatoes the second time around really irked me.  So visit three was brunch and I have to say it does live up to the hype. The brunch was muito bom as they say in Portuguese, I had the Pub Burger and I have to say this is one of the best burgers I have had in my entire life as well as in Pittsburgh. The pastrami belly was just cooked to perfection and seasoned just right. The bun was perfect and the horseradish cheddar complimented the entire burger perfectly. The fried egg was perfect and thank you chef for keeping that yolk runny like my nose as I write this - unrelenting (gross, I know).  I tried my friends' Grilled Cheese and it was delicious and next time I will be trying the Brisket Hash because it was just delightful.   The bloody mary bar was as good as any other bloody mary bar you can find around town. I specifically ordered the Quarterdeck and it was very good. The folks that own these establishments really make excellent drinks.  Finally, I went back again for dinner and Ordered the Wagyu flatiron and...not bad. Not fantastic, but with such a fine cut of meat I expected more. Just a bit dry for my taste. My sister's pappardelle however, was perfect and that pork shoulder fell apart in my mouth and I wish I had ordered that. Though simple, they really toasted that garlic bread really well and I don't know what it was but there was a slight non-garlicy zing to the bread or maybe just herbal butter or something..but it was great!  As you can see the waves of consistency truly have a great impact on this review and hence the 3 stars.   Overall, beautiful atmosphere, perfect for dates and gatherings, good for what it is (gastropub with old world style décor), fantastic drinks, but food needs more consistency and can be hit or miss. Service is great!"}
{"text":"This place is literally my favorite place to eat in pittsburgh. My boyfriend and I stumbled across it when at the three rivers art festival last year and decided to give it a shot... So glad we did.   Every time we come here, we start off with some appetizers. Their fried taters are small. Cut French fries that come with their house made aioli- which is incredible. Their fried pickles are literally the best in all of the burgh- they come with spicy ranch dressing, again, housemade, and are to die for. I switch up the entrees each time I go- they have different specials each week. Their Waldorf salad is delicious. I've had the three little pigs sandwich which is incredibly large and worth the money.  The drinks are amazing. They have tons of unique beers on tap and last time I went I asked the bar tender for a fruity drink- he made me a drink with an egg white in it! Sounds odd but it was awesome.. Where else can you get that? Their deserts are incredible- they have a desert chef who makes the deserts as fresh as they come. Their chocolate mouse is incredible.  Meat and potatoes is a must. It's my favorite restaurant and they do everything perfect. Brunch, lunch and dinner- each menu is amazing. I'm obsessed."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best brunch spots in the city!  Not only is the food great, they also have a bloody Mary bar on Sundays.  My husband jokes that he could make a meal out of the options on the bloody Mary bar."}
{"text":"Ordered the 45oz bone in tomahawk ribeye--medium with confit potatoes and buffalo Mac n cheese. Very disappointed with the result--steak was significantly undercooked and under-flavored. The portion size is excellent but the cut of meat is not the highest grade. The steak truly needs a sauce (their house steak sauce was very good), but any steak enthusiast will tell you that a great steak should never be tarnished with even a great sauce. The confit potatoes and buffalo Mac were very average. Service and atmosphere were great. Strictly based on the taste and quality of food and factoring in cost, I would not come here for the food. Very good for a pub steak but well below average for a steakhouse steak. Likely will not return."}
{"text":"Always come to this place when I visit Pittsburgh. Whatever you get is going to be absolutely delish. My favorite: huevos rancheros. You can't miss their mimosas either!!"}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere of Meat and Potatoes was awesome! I had the Plain Jane Burger, and my boyfriend had the Brisket Sandwich. Both were delicious and cooked to perfection. I highly recommend this restaurant if you're in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Original and great food. Top notch service. Beautiful atmosphere. My favorite in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Was in town passing through and this was the first restaurant to come up with 4 starts. Well deserved!! Didn't have a reservation but got a seat at the bar. Just had beer so I can't comment on the drinks. Had the fried chicken livers for a snack. Delicious if you don't mind liver texture. Had the pork belly sliders and some of my buddy's curry muscles for dinner. Both were delicious. Huge portions and great taste. Guy next to us had the pork chop. It was about the size of a brick! Like I said huge portions. Next time I'll go with a fellow carnivore and get the 34oz steak."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best meal I have had in my 38 years on this earth. Food and service were excellent. Great coctails to pair with the meals as well. Emily B was our server and she was very knowledgeable of their menu."}
{"text":"The food's ok, the ambiance is better.  The fried brussel sprouts were lemony, too salty, and had too much parmesan cheese, the ranch dressing on the side was unnecessary.  The Kobe Corndog was pretty good on the inside, with a very pinkish hotdog meat. The outer breading was rather dry and too thick. On top was sprinkled a few leaves of cilantro, very thin radish slices, and a light wasabi-based sauce - these additions didn't really add to the corndog. The ketchup on the side was unnecessary.  The wagyu iron flat, the beef was a good texture, easy to chew and eat. It was a nice pink color in the center and browned on the outside. It was also too salty. I liked the sweet and slight tartness of the picked red onions. The yucca fries were rather dehydrated but ok. The plantain chips were too hard and dry.  Lively gastropub, there is a large square bar area in the center of the room, wood tables and comfy plush chairs around the room's peripheral, . Dim lighting with filament light bulbs, upbeat music playing overhead, and plenty of chatter. Seems hip and happening.  The service was good, the waitress was attentive and considerate."}
{"text":"How has this place been open for two years and I haven't been there yet!    There was honestly not one bad thing about this visit.  From the amazingly interesting and tasty drinks to the perfectly plated duck, I really need to go back - now.  Our trip there was my birthday lunch and since I was not going back to work, bring on the drinks.  I started with the glenshaw sour and was a bit disturbed by the egg whites that it contained, but all of my fears were alleviated with that first frothy lemony sip.  I followed that up with a brandy buck - how many birthday lunches does a person get?  Applejack brandy and pungent ginger were a perfect combination.  M had the thai steak salad that was piled high with thin strips of skirt steak.  It looked amazing.  J had the mussels.  It might have been the biggest pile of mussels I have ever seen - and we eat a lot of mussels.  The pancetta in the sauce definitely differentiated these mussels from others around town.  I had the duck.  Perfectly medium rare duck slices over spaetzle with massive saurkraut pierogies.  I was in heaven.  We finished it off with some of the creamist creme brulee I have ever had.   Awesome birthday lunch.  Can't wait to go back for brunch, dinner, more lunch, drinks...."}
{"text":"Amazing meal, a bit cramped but ended up making friends with the table next to us. Will be back to try more offerings from the menu. The servers were very attentive and provided good menu suggestions. Our appetizers were so tasty waiting for our meal was a pleasure."}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday dinner a while back and I was so satisfied with the meal! First the environment and decor is between rustic and modern and it almost felt like it was between divey and trendy/nice without it feeling disgusting. I think the reason why it felt divey was because of the half oval bar in the middle of the restaurant, where it seemed very \"college-y\" with people hanging around or draping themselves all over it.  They have an insanely extensive whiskey menu, which basically won me over at that point! My table shared an order of the fried pickles as an appetizer, and I got the Red Snapper. It's a bit on the lighter side, which is what I wanted, with a lot of veggies, and the fish was cooked so well. Next time, I want to try the Pork Chop. The table next to mine had a few people that ordered it and it was huge... huge. It looked really good.  Their seasonal menu also sounded really good and I'm sure it was! We also got 2 desserts, which I believe were also on rotation. One was a pb oreo dirt pot, and the other was a malted chocolate pot de creme... and the pot de creme was to die for. It is definitely one of the best restaurant desserts I've ever had!"}
{"text":"I've been here three times now and thought it was time I did some raving! The first two times I came in groups for formal-ish dinners with work. Both times phenomenal service and incredible food. They have a back room that's quieter that you can reserve (or rent out? I'm not sure - someone else was paying). The third time I came with my parents for my medical school graduation a few weeks ago. My parents are notoriously impossible to please when it comes to restaurants. I've never seen them get beyond a \"I guess this place is ok\" sentiment. But Meat & Potatoes seriously won them over. My dad was in love with the beer menu (\"tins\" only), my sister was in love with the historic cocktails, even my mother was thrilled by her food (never happens).  The vibe is cool, the menu is incredible, the quality is great, and the prices are totally reasonable for what you're getting. I wish I could afford to eat here every day.  The devils on horseback - laced with crack, I swear. And I thought I hated dates.  The cocktails - I've tried half the menu by now, all amazing.   My one teensy tiny bit of constructive criticism, just for the sake of not glowing too much - make sure you don't get a table immediately next to the bar if possible. They're placed pretty close and if the bar gets crowded (it's right in the middle of the dining room), sometimes other patrons will invade your space. We actually asked them not so seat us at a table that was already invaded. They obliged, and then we watched 3 other families also refuse the table. I did feel a little sorry for the poor souls who eventually ended up at it. But not that sorry, because the food and the drink and the awesomeness would have made it worth a little discomfort anyway."}
{"text":"Dishes were too upscale for my boyfriend and I. We were unfamiliar with most of the words and foods. We tried the bone marrow appetizer and meat & potatoes for the main course. The bone marrow was new to us, and it was very bland in taste and slimy in texture due to the high fat content. The steak was pretty good but not phenomenal. None of the food was worth the (high) price."}
{"text":"Every time a special event crops up, the answer to the question \"where should we go to celebrate?\" is always Meat and Potatoes.   Sometimes I'll try to mitigate the compulsion to eat here and try somewhere new, but more often than not we'll end up tucked away in an intimate table at our old standby.   Everything about Meat and Potatoes, from the obsessive attention to detail where cooking to order is concerned to the fantastic presentation of the food helps it maintain it's place on the top of our list.   The decor - a smallish place with intimate tables organized around a beautiful central bar in a very pre -prohibition era look - is reflected in their libations selections. And these bar tenders can actually mix drinks! Amazing!    The only possible downside is that, due to the open floor plan and the positioning of the bar, the place can seem a bit crowded and boisterous. If this does not jive with your idea of romance, choose a non-romantic reason to come.   There are only two \"bad\" seats in the house. A two top directly to the right of the entrance and a table along the curve of the wall that's really hard to get in and out of.   What really, really makes this place for me is the service. The wait staff is always subtly there but not in your face. They're knowledgeable without being snotty and very attentive.   The menu features a range of delicious options and preparations like the sweatbread tacos make some more intimidating choices accessible to those who might not otherwise try them.    All things aside, the absolute best thing about this place is that I have never been dissatisfied with either food or experience. In all the years that they've been open, there has not been one time where I thought the quality was slipping and that is really something else.   Hope this was helpful!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in the burgh! I've been to Meat & Potatoes close to 10 times and I have always had amazing food.  The menu always changes, but my last visit led me to the best burger of my life, partly due to the fois gras and black truffle.  The truffle aioli served with the fries is so great that you will want to eat only that, every night of the week.  Brunch on weekends is amazing as well, and there is a build your own bloody mary bar.  They have mixologists on staff and the cocktails might be the best in town.   The bar staff is great but the table service can be a little slow at times.    I will be back.  Many times!"}
{"text":"Brunch here was a real treat! 5 friends and I decided to treat ourselves as late semester pick me up and it couldn't have been much better.  We had a reservation (highly recommended, as the space is small and popular) and were seated relatively quickly. We each ordered something different and passed plates:  -Brisket and Eggs: Delicious, the meat was a little tough, but the kimchi made up for it.  -Irish Benedict: Hearty but a bit bland. It also was really heavy. Definitely the least favorite.  -Short Rib Hash: Pretty good, is a somewhat small portion but apparently was filling  -French Toast: Absolute perfection. It was a bit sweet but all of the flavors worked well together.  -Omelet Special (Sundried Tomato, Cheese Curds, Roast Beef)-Pretty good, but the real star was the potato gratin that came on the side. That was divine.   We also decided to share 3 desserts. They were small so it worked out:  -Black Bottom Chocolate Pecan: The presentation was awesome-it came in a jar with whipped cream on top! It was really warm and rich. Definitely delicious, but probably couldn't have eaten one by myself.  -Pumpkin Tarte with Cranberry Sauce-Yum! Very festive and not too heavy. It was also less sweet which was pretty good considering the other 2 desserts.  -Mudslide Tiramisu: Light, flavorful and just great. This was probably the table's favorite. I would definitely order this again, no matter the time of the year.   All in all, Meat and Potatoes was a delicious treat, and  I hope to go back soon!"}
{"text":"My advice for you.....make a rsvp. Otherwise, the waiting line will be hours and hours. But it is so worth it.   The food is great. The ambience is perfect and classy. The staff is welcoming and knowledgeable.   Their brunch food is what they are well known for (in my opinion) but you really can't go wrong with either meal. The bloody Mary is quite the gem as well."}
{"text":"We have been trying to get reservations for months at this restaurant and finally made it there last night. I have to share I have no idea what the hype is for this restaurant. The menu was anything but meat and potatoes. My friend ordered the special braised pork Pierogies and they were not edible. She said that there was a strange smell to them. Another friend ordered a burger and said it was fine but no different than other burgers. Another friend ordered the burger that came with pork. The pork was s big piece of fat that she had to remove. I ordered the catfish tacos which was really the only thing on the menu that interested me. They were good but really, I was at a restaurant named Meat and Potatoes. Silly me, I thought I would be ordering a nice seared rare filet with some fingerling potatoes made special by the chef. I was very disappointed and won't be returning. I just can't figure out why they are doing so well with all of the truly fabulous restaurants in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"During my first real visit to Pittsburgh I had the joy of sitting down to a meal at Meat & Potatoes- being from Philadelphia people have a lot of bad things to say about Pittsburgh (not sure why, probably because we're just mean), but the meal I had here did many things to break down these rumors and start me toward thinking that Pittsburgh could be an awesome place.   The waitress we had was super attentive and friendly and any place that serves things in jars basically has me hooked from the onset. As for the food, I tried the tacos and mac n cheese simply because I was having serious trouble deciding and just randomly picked, and I was not disappointed with my choice. The mixture of meat/bbq sauce/apple slaw creates quite the mouth-gasm upon eating. and the mac N cheese was so rich I had to take half of it home- it was simply too great. I suppose my only complaint might be that the neighboring table (and perhaps my dinner companion) might have heard my moderately audible moans. whoops. so impolite. but moving on...  Being that I've only been here once I can't quite give them a 5 star rating only because I think I'd need to eat another meal here, but from what I've tried I can certainly say they've got my attention, and I would certainly repeat my visit to try all the other delights they have to offer."}
{"text":"a delicious late night steak tartare.  what else to say?  darkly lit, strong bar atmosphere.  in a good way.  if you think you can hang, go check it out.  can be intimidating.  in a good way.  worth a trip down to the cultural district just because."}
{"text":"Amazing brunch in downtown Pittsburgh.  So much to choose from!!!!  We had the special egg's benedict with smoked turkey, huevos rancheros and fries with truffle mayo.  Great drinks, ambience, service, and huge portions.  This place will want to make you live in Pittsburgh.  Definitely make a reservation.  We had a 11 AM table, and by the time it was 11:30 it was jammed packed."}
{"text":"Love it here! I dream of their cheese plate!!! The wagyu and brussels sprouts are to-die as well."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed their Sunday brunch here. I ordered the meat sampler, which was entirely too much for this girl to eat herself. The server, who was excellent, did warn me beforehand. I will say that Sundays are overwhelmingly busy and the place is pretty small. So, if you don't mind a crowd, it's a fine place for brunch. I went again recently on a weeknight. Although the food was good, there was nothing original or impressive about it. I'm an avid home cook, so I recognize a lot of dishes \"borrowed\" from more established chefs out there. Still, it was tasty and I think that this restaurant is a good addition to the downtown restaurant scene. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"So I should start out by saying when I eat an expensive restaurant, my expectations are pretty high.  The food was fine but we were disappointed with the service.  After we sat down it probably took about 20 minutes for someone to even come and take our drink order.  Unfortunately this trend continued throughout the dinner with the server never being around when we needed her.  We ended up ordering 1 less drink than usual because of the slow service."}
{"text":"Reservations for two Saturday night 4/9/16. All around great experience. The waitress was friendly and attentive. We choose the smokey wings as our appetizer and the steak and frites for our entrees. The wings were flavorful and the steak cut like butter. We couldn't ask for anything more at Meat & Potatoes! We came for meat and we ate meat!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great service, great drinks, went there on New Years but make sure there are no bills to be paid. \"Can't put a price on a good time !"}
{"text":"Went here for Easter dinner and it was just amazing. It is elegant and very normally priced, and the food is just unreal. I definitely will return again soon! Also, reservations are necessary. Don't try to go on a Friday or Saturday (or any night really) without a reservation, because chances are they are completely booked!"}
{"text":"There aren't enough stars or superlatives in the world to adequately rate this place! Incredible! Phenomenal! Excellent!   The drinks are top notch. The bartenders are beyond just bartenders, they are truly mixologists who take pride in their work. Each craft cocktail was carefully balanced and simply delicious!    The food coming out of the kitchen all looked and smelled insanely good! We started with fried Brussels and devils on horseback. Both were outstanding!! Next we checked out the mussels of the day and selected a Thai inspired coconut curried broth with mussels and bread for soaking up that awesome sauce. When I tell you they were THE BEST mussels I've EVER HAD, I mean it! So many places have underseasoned broths resulting in flavorless mussels. Not here! It was to die for!   We weren't able to continue on to entrees as we were delightful stuffed after our three starters and cocktails. But the couple next to us ordered the 75 oz ribeye for two and graciously allowed us to try the steak and bone marrow gratin. Melt in your mouth deliciousness!!   You can't go wrong at Meat and Potatoes!! Almost too good to be true!"}
{"text":"I've had 2 great experiences here. Pricy, totally worth it :) great portion sizes! Their potatoes are absolutely delicious. I don't have much more to add that hasn't already been said haha. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Drinks are wonderful....but the food is uneven. When it is good, it is very good...when it isn't....it isn't bad, it just lacks impact."}
{"text":"I've heard rave reviews of the brunch here so decided to try it out. It did not disappoint! I got the Pub Burger and WOW... so delicious. The service was great as well. Our server wasn't constantly checking in, but seemed to notice when we needed more water, drinks, etc.   There was a huge mix of people there also; young couples, elderly folks, families, and the like. Also, there was a DJ which I thought was odd at first. Until I heard the mix of music. It was fantastic!  I'll definitely go again. The Bloody Mary bar is to die for."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! Big portions and full of flavor. I'm so happy my Uber driver suggested this place and I was able to convince my group to travel away from campus to try and validate the yumminess.  Now for the bad the hostess/host stand and seating process is a joke. We came on a Wednesday right before noon and visually saw empty tables but we had to wait in line to tell the hostess we would like a table for two ppl. Either the gal at the stand wasn't familiar with the system or she is forced (let's hope forced) to fill-in fields (she asked for our name and phone #) and she actually had to print out a small ticket to give to the guy that took us to our table. WTF!?!?!? It took a while and again, we could see the empty tables.  We finally were seated at a tiny table inside. We had luggage so this was not ideal. The waiter was prompt but asked us for our beverage order yet we had no drink menus to select from (small mistake and very forgivable).   I would definitely come back when I visit Pittsburgh again however perhaps I'll make a reservation, naaaahh, I don't think that will help that seating process."}
{"text":"It was virtually impossible for us to get a reservation for two while in town for Labor Day but the stars somehow aligned and we got in. And it was delicious.  We started with drinks from the bar, then kept ordering food. The tuna taquitos for him to start and the moules of the day for me. The ahi was delicious and a creamy spread of fresh avocado inside the crunchy shell made for a nice handheld appetizer. My mussels were packed with flavor and unique. We also had an order of the chorizo mac 'n cheese, which we both managed to eat quickly.   Atmosphere is fabulous. What a cool spot. Our server was okay - he wasn't overly helpful when I asked about a few of the specialty cocktails nor did I feel he was good at recommending items. Oh well. We still had a great night at M&P. My man ordered the burger (medium rare) and fries and loved it. Full from the mussels I ordered the devils on horseback appetizer which were the most perfect trio of stuffed dates wrapped in a slightly salty bacon. For dessert we shared the dirt pudding, reminiscent of our childhood years with layers of chocolately rich pudding and crushed oreos. The adult version was so good.   One of our favorite dining experiences while in Pittsburgh. Kudos, Meat and Potatoes!"}
{"text":"Pittsburgh, as a tourist here for the first time, my hat's off to you!  Meat & Potatoes lives up to its name, and the food here was exactly what we needed on a rainy and cold night!  The pot roast was unbelievable, and their gnocchi special was the s***!"}
{"text":"We stopped in last night.  I couldn't get reservations when I called earlier in the week, but we were going to Heinz Hall right across the street so we figured we might be able to get a seat at the bar.  Luckily we did.  It was packed and now we know why.  Good drinks, fantastic food.  We had the Brussel sprouts, Tartare, and the Mushroom flatbread.  All delicious.  Can't wait to go back.  Service was smooth and Chef DeShantz is a genius."}
{"text":"I went here on a date last night and, as much as I loved my company, I may have considered leaving him for whoever prepared the duck. Delicious. Not too game-y but just enough. Perfect at medium-rare and teamed up wonderfully with the accompanying pierogies, etc. The only thing I wasn't terribly keen on was the dressing for the greens. The flavor was a tad overpowering/bitter. And I tend to like bitter. My date and I also split the prosciutto mac n cheese and the fried pickles before the meal. Both perfection, although in retrospect we ordered waaaay too much food for just the two of us. This is also a really nice date spot - great ambiance - as a lot of previous reviewers have mentioned."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I had a great meal here! We were seated right away and the food was delicious!!! I got the hot chicken and he had the buffalo wings. I highly recommend these choices. Such a great atmosphere too!! Can't wait to go again"}
{"text":"This place was very delicious. The presentation was amazing, you always taste your food first with smell and sight  We had the oysters, poutine and Brussels sprouts for apps I would recommend all!!! We then had the flat iron steak, lamb, salmon and Hamburger they were all amazing!!! The adult beverages  the one with tequila a honey bee something mmmm YESSS please!  If your in the area go!!!  We didn't sit in main dining we had to sit in back for walk ins and would do it again, plus the staff was so happy and helpful so knowledgeable!!!"}
{"text":"Soo good!!! Love the Bone marrow, yummmmm. Deff should try if in Pittsburgh. Can be a bit expensive but hay, you get what you pay for. I recommend making a reservation because it is a very popular place. I typically just sit at the bar but even that can get crowded."}
{"text":"Fabulous food. Started with the chicken wings- probably the best we've ever eaten. The Caesar salad was over the top as well, topped with pork rinds that we're as light as a feather and delicious. The hanger steak entree was perfect. Our only complaint was slow service but otherwise very very good."}
{"text":"Very interesting menu. I had the bone marrow on bread, it was GOOD! Very nice modern atmosphere. Hot young professionals like to hang out here."}
{"text":"Guys, I finally made it to M&P!!  After a couple false starts, I finally got my act together, made a reservation well in advance, and brought a fellow aspiring foodie friend who was visiting town.  We split the bone marrow appetizer, which is three huge femurs and an assortment of toppings, served with toasted bread.  Fantastic.  I chose the special salad, which consisted of roasted Brussels sprouts with candied walnuts and a brisket vinaigrette dressing, and then talked myself out of the Wagyu flatiron (next visit) and into the pappardelle pasta dish that comes in a ragu sauce that was made by angels.  I opted not to get a cocktail and paired it all with a nice dry cider instead.  My friend got the pastrami crusted duck, and she delighted in it.  We both took ours home for a second meal.  We were well pleased.  Service was excellent, and the atmosphere is very much in keeping with the design aesthetic of this restaurant group--a bit eclectic, rustic, and modern hipster.  Well worth the visit, and I look forward to a return."}
{"text":"I came here in March one Sun. morning, after hearing the hype about the brunch.  While I'm always curious to try much-hyped restaurants, I'm always a bit skeptical--I guess this comes from being afraid that I'll be disappointed.  My dining companion, who'd been here several times with other people, had been wanting to come with me, but I was never able to get a reservation (I've heard you have to reserve weeks ahead, which is testament to just how popular brunch is here).  However, he informed me that he'd always sat at the bar, which doesn't require a reservation, so we decided to try for that.  We arrived at about 11am, and, after about a half hour wait, we were seated.  I was torn over whether to try the bloody Mary bar, which many other reviewers recommended, or a brunchtail, recommended by my dining companion.  Between wanting to save room for food and the cocktail of the day (I forget exactly what it was, but it had rhubarb, which I love), I opted for the hair of the dog, which turned out to be an excellent choice--indeed, so excellent that when the bartender asked if I wanted another, I assented enthusiastically, which I never do, since I try to be conscious of my alcohol intake.  For my entree, I ordered the chicken and waffles, per reviewer recommendations, even though I was a bit skeptical since I don't really care for jalapeno.  I had never tried this dish before, but I've had it since (in Atlanta, no less), so I have a standard for comparison.  While I always hesitate to use this much-cliched word, it was--epic!  The bourbon maple syrup was sweet, but not overly so, and it complemented the savoriness of the waffle (in which I couldn't taste any jalapeno at all) perfectly.  I took the chicken off of the waffle and poured the syrup directly on it in order to ensure that as much of it covered the waffle as possible, and then replaced the chicken.  The chicken was delightfully crispy on the outside and tender and juicy inside--some of the best fried chicken I've had in PGH.  Since I couldn't hope to eat the whole thing in one sitting (it's huge!), I ate the waffle and half the chicken, and took half the chicken home (it was still great the next day!).   After eating the waffle, I felt so full, there was no need for another meal until 5pm.  The atmosphere is great--very trendy and bright, and there's a DJ spinning tunes on Sun. mornings.  The bartenders, who served us, were attentive and helpful.  While I initially doubted I'd come out saying this, I can confidently say that M&P brunch is worth the hype.  Try it--you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We chose this venue for the last night of our Pittsburgh mini-vacation.  I began with the house's barrel aged Manhattan cocktail. Smooth, and not too sweet. My partner had her usual Riesling.  We shared the marrow bones, which at $18 are priced and portioned for two. This may have been the single best presentation of this dish I have encountered - and I've been eating them since I had them at St. John in London back in 2002 when this was a new idea. Three large bones, packed with marrow. Condiments were gros sel, pickled onion, capers, and a gremolata. I tried all four condiments - the salt worked best. The charred toasts were also excellent and moist with oil. We demanded more toasts to process the luscious masses of marrow.  For a main course I selected the lamb cassoulet. If I remember the menu correctly, this comprised lamb neck (Jamison farm?), lamb sausage and a sort of \"streusel\" of lamb bacon. The dish arrived as a sort of timbale of meat atop a ragout of beans, topped with pea greens. It was attractive if not the typical presentation. No confit, no duck or goose. The lamb was tender, the cut more like half of a  braised lamb shank than the usual slice of neck. The beans had the proper texture. The sausage sort of broke down. Overall I enjoyed the dish, but descriptions fail me  it's sort of a cross between a braised lamb shank and a cassoulet.   I washed it down with Terrazas Cabernet from Argentina, a great buy.  My partner plumped for the roasted Pennsylvania chicken which was firing on all cylinders. Despite it being tender young chicken there was a deep flavor, nice round dumplings, bacon fat. The sauerkraut and Brussels sprouts sort of disappeared into the juices.  Collard greens, a side order were light, spicy and sweet - not the usual taste of turkey neck or pork bones.  No room for dessert after the marrow and meats.  Good service and good value."}
{"text":"I find places to eat sometimes by purely seeing which few spots are the \"most reviewed \" in an area. This was #1 in Pittsburgh, so I went!  Appearance: I drove RIGHT by this place once because I couldn't see the signs in the windows for it. Lol. It's a surprisingly small, quaint, cozy gastropub tucked into the first floor of which looks to be an office building that you have to walk through a lobby to get to. The big windows at the back of the restaurant unfortunately face the side of another building, but the 2 giant ones at the front give you a decent view of the street. It's all street parking, so good luck with that.  Atmosphere: I LOVED it here! OMG! The giant, high ceilings, the interesting light fixtures, the staff uniforms and the freaking mirrors that curved with the walls were awesome. It was hype in there! Loud, but a good loud, like people were having fun loud, but you could still talk to the person next to you or more importantly, the bartender! I enjoyed that the bar was the center piece of the whole establishment and everything basically was designed around it! It just made so much sense.  Service: Blake took amazing care of me. Great conversationalist, made good recommendations and he made me feel so welcomed there. He was attentive and amazingly friendly which just made my experience that much better.  Food: I started with their Hot Cider which comes with a shot of Crown Royal Apple. It was absolutely delicious. I could barely taste the alcohol... so I added more, quite a bit more. Lol. Blake raved about the Smoked Wings here, so I just HAD to try them. 12 for $14.00 in a place like this, so I thought it was a great deal and OMG. They were AMAZING. I'd pay regular price for these all day long. They're smoked for like 630 hours, tossed in their whiskey buffalo sauce, fried, then tossed in that sauce again. They come out in a skillet on a wooden plank topped with green onions with your choice of sauce. Huge wings. Like, when I tell you I was going to eat these then move right on to the main course, these wings stopped me dead in my tracks. I had to force the last 2 down and was so glad I ordered them.  Value: Looking at the menu there was a bit of sticker shock. Meatloaf for $25.00, Roasted Chicken for $25.00 and their famous 45 oz. Ribeye al la carte for $75.00. Things were a bit pricey, but for what I paid for MY meal (partly why I went with cheaper options) I felt it was a great value. Perhaps if I'm feelin' spendy, I'll splurge on one of the more expensive entrees.  In conclusion, this is totally somewhere you have to come check out. I had a great time here all by myself sitting at the bar and just hanging out. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I was a bit hesitant to come here based on my experience earlier in the day, but the experience turned out to be excellent  Ordered the pork chop. I was suggested this after i saw that the menu listed the steak (whatever cut it was) was for two ppl. Anyway the pork chop ended up being more than enough even for me (~16 oz alone). I was asked how i wanted it cooked \"medium well\". And medium well it came.   Overall, portions were plentiful. I only couldn't finish the collard greens. And the drinks were on point.   I'd be more than happy to return"}
{"text":"By far the best brunch I have had in Pittsburgh. You might not expect much from fried chicken and waffles, but it was so delicious, and not to mention huge. The huevos rancheros was bursting with Mexican flavor and freshness, I was so impressed with the pulled pork. We've been trying to bring a group back for brunch but they're always booked! Make sure to make a reservation a few weeks in advance especially if you have more than 4!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place. Great vibe, great food.  Duck breast is always prepped perfectly. Pub burger is massive. Brussels sprouts are amazing!  Buffalo mac and cheese so good people stopped by the table to find out what was making everyone look practically orgasmic.  Mexican honey bee drink was good but even more enjoyable to watch the bartender make. Mescal in a spritzer, wow!    Only issue is the tight squeeze with the really small space. Noise level is minimal, though, so really easy to hear own party but no one else."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Great vibe, great service, and good drinks.  Bone marrow was good and 45 oz ribeye was enough for three."}
{"text":"We went here on a Sunday for brunch and loved it!  Great atmosphere and yummy food.  The fries with truffled mayo are a must.  My favorite part was most def. the bloody mary bar.  They have several house infused vodkas to choose from. Off the top of my head I can recall- garlic pepper,  bacon, and dill.  They were all great!   For $5 they bring you a pint glass with the vodka of your choice, and then you make your way to the bar to create the bloody mary of your dreams.  All kinds of awesome garnishes, spices, and hot sauces to choose from.    Ahhh take me back.    :)"}
{"text":"Don't believe the hype.  The place has potential, maybe just resting on their laurels. 745pm reservation: \" We're not ready for you. Please have a seat while we clean up a table...\" 805pm: \"Almost ready...just need to get the other people out.\" Jerry Seinfeld :\" Why is it called a reservation?\"  815pm...seated.  Ask to see a wine list. Ask to order some appetizers while we consider the menu.  Waiter says:  \" I need you to order at one time so we can maintain the pace\"......Pace? Are we being timed?  I order a nice red....served without stemware...each glass (cup?) filled to  1/4\" below the lip..... Appetizers: Devils on Horseback and Salty Pig.... I can see the potential but both served barely warm and 10 minutes apart. Entrees: Plain Jane Burger and Lamb Sirloin special..... 10 minutes apart and lukewarm....Lamb plate was like a Rochester NY Garbage Plate.... zero presentation. Pretentious, indifferent service.  Hosts/hostesses would do well to look up from their iPads. Ah well...win some lose some...countless other good choices in this town."}
{"text":"Coming in on business for a late Tuesday dinner. We were looking forward to the meal.   Pros: Ambiance is nice, menu is inspired for a protein-centric restaurant, and cocktails were delicious. Food was well-plated and flavourful.   Cons: The wait staff soured the experience. Three seasoned business travellers who are very low maintenance diners were met with 'tude' early and often. Every touchpoint (beyond the very accommodating reservation team) was excessively curt and full of eye rolls.   Go for the food...but know what you're in for."}
{"text":"Overall the experience was great, but for the price you're paying you'd expect larger portions and better drinks."}
{"text":"Once again, another wonderful experience at Meat & Potatoes!  With tickets to an 8 PM show, we arrived for our 5:45 PM reservation and were seated immediately.  Our server, Adam, introduced himself quickly and was very good throughout the meal of stopping to fill water glasses and check in, without being intrusive or making us feel rushed.  If you like sours, the bar makes their own homemade sours and they are really good.  I loved my whiskey sour!  Dinner was pot roast for my friend and I had the heirloom tomato feta salad (on the specials) and the curry mussels, which were fantastic!  I love the spice and thickness of the broth, which make for delicious dipping for the garlic bread. I only wish that the tables were not quite so close to each other, but otherwise, this was a fantastic way to enjoy a girls night out for the dinner part of dinner and a show!"}
{"text":"I love Meat & Potatoes.  The drink menu is well balanced.  Everyone I'm with typically finds something they will enjoy, whether it is wine, beer, or a fancy cocktail.  As a word of warning, I've found the dishes to all be rather greasy.  This includes the salads.  You should expect that given all name, but just a heads up.  The sandwiches are huge.  I enjoyed the Three Little Pigs and the burger.  I found the Korean Reuben to be a little off, I think it would be better without the cheese.  The salmon is great as is the pasta dishes.  All of the appetizers are great.  The only food I haven't had is the steak.  I haven't found anyone willing to share it with me yet."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the atmosphere and gastropub set up!   My friend and I split the bone marrow, which was a unique experience. I appreciated that they brought toppings and seasonings on the plate with the bone marrow.   I decided on the short rib flatbread for my main dish, and I was very happy with this choice! The flavor and ratio of cheese, meat and bread was perfect!   We capped off the meal with the chocolate bread pudding that was also very good. My suggestion on this would be a better ice cream. I pictured more if a vanilla bean.   All in all, very good and already looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"First let me say that any restaurant that has fried pickles listed on the menu piques my interest.  Then to read on the menu that they make their own pickles in house was an extra bonus.  These pickles were thick cut and so favorable that I could probably have eaten a whole serving of just the plain pickles, but everyone knows that frying something gives it a little extra savory flavor. The coating they use was perfect, crunchy, and complimented the pickle itself.  The spicy ranch used as a side for dipping when added made this treat, for lack of a better term, perfection.  My god, my mouth is watering even now as I write this.  Enough with the pickles though.  When we arrived at Meat & Potatoes a show was letting out at the Cabaret, so we weren't sure we would get a seat.  If we didn't there were more places to choose from in the Cultural District.  Luckily for us, when we walked in and were greeted by the hostess and asked if we had a reservation and our answer was no, we weren't turned away.  We were told that we could wait for a table or walk in and find a bar seat.  We opted for a bar seat, good choice.  Once we sat down we were basically tag teamed by the bartenders.  One was handing us a menu and telling us the drink specials as the other was pouring us a glass of water.  The menu is small, but that didn't make the decision making any easier...at all.  It was easy to pick the appetizers, fried pickles as mentioned before and we also got an order of poutine.  Since I've already salivated all over myself, the keyboard and the floor because of the pickles, I really shouldn't write more about them.  I will focus on the poutine.  As it was said before by other reviewers, these are spiced to perfection and as I am going to say, melt in your mouth.  Imagine if you will if you decided to go to Kennywood to get some Potato Patch fries and instead you walk up and they were substituting Meat & Potatoes version instead.  Just take the Potato Patch fries and miniaturize them.  Fresh cut, fried up to a nice golden brown and tossed with some of the best spices you can imagine.  Cheese curd melted throughout and topped with some of the best gravy you can find.  These and the pickles could have been a meal enough for me, but you know I didn't stop there.  While we waited for our entrees to show up, we had a libation as well.  I opted for the Erie Oatmeal Stout while my friend had herself a Moscow Mule.  Both were so satisfying, but I can tell you that the Moscow Mule was by far tastier with the combination of food we were having.  While we also waited for our food to come out the bartenders made chit chat with everyone that was seated around the bar.   Recently I have been on a quest to find the perfect burger in the Burgh, so of course I opted for their Plain Jane burger.  I can say that this is one of the few places that can cook a burger to medium well and it tastes like it's cooked medium well.  Perfect portion of burger too, the patty was a little thicker in the middle but I wasn't worried about that.  Romaine lettuce, tomato, red onions and more house pickles to top the patty.  I also opted to add cheese, a nice white cheddar.  This time the pickles were sweet pickles and the mixture of taste with all the toppings was like a mouthgasm.  From the bun to the pickles I was very happy.  The burger was definitely an excellent decision to make that night.  More pomme frites were a side here and sadly, after all that great food, I could not finish them.  Definitely a return trip to this place, and definitely a bar seat again for me."}
{"text":"I dined here for the first time for dinner a few weeks ago! Very tough to get a reservation because the dining area is a bit small, but I was very impressed with the comfy seats at the table and ambience. I ordered the pot roast and the pb&j dessert. The only critique I have is that the menu is not very big but it is yummy!"}
{"text":"A great find by my bride. A very unique \"hipster\" locale, with a prohibition themed menu but with a severe twist. For example, the steak Tartare is a very old school traditional, yet theirs has Thai red peppers & and a seaweed based accent. While it was  good, it I was a bit unexpected.   High marks to the brussel sprouts, smoked pork shop and the old fashioned.   We would certainly come back in the future."}
{"text":"Food is outstanding, service was great!!  The barrel aged Manhattans are they best drink you will ever have!!!  You will spend a little more at this restaurant but it is 1000% worth it!!  If you are in the cultural district and don't come to Meat & Potatoes, you're doing it wrong!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  Based on reviews I took my wife and two 20 something sons to Meat and Potatoes.  The ambiance is fine and the bartenders were quick and attentive.  We were seated on time and ordered the Duck pate for the table.  It was very good.  Thats where it ended for three of the four of us.  My son and I shared the 45oz ribeye and ordered it medium rare.  My wife ordered the sirloin special medium rare and my other son the pot roast with truffle fries for the table.  The pot roast and fries were great.  However both steaks came out raw (actually cold in the middle). My wife sent hers back and it came back medium to medium well...typical BS kitchen response to undercooked steak...sent it back over cooked to prove they cooked it right the first time.  We gave up and didn't finish our meals.  Was surprised the waiter didn't say anything...we tipped him well as it wasn't his fault.  How this is number one is beyond comprehension.  Capital grill is 100 times better."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Went there today evening with friends and they forgot my order.  My friends got 15% off their order though!! Walked out hungry. Don't think I will be going there anymore."}
{"text":"Great food, drinks, and service. Everything was delicious and the meat was prepared perfectly. They lived up to the name! We had the lamb shank, mushroom risotto, beet salad, rosemary potatoes, and brussel sprouts. The lamb, salad, and sprouts were amazing. The risotto was flavorful, but was a little undercooked for my liking. The potatoes were well seasoned, but were huge. It was basically a bowl of baked potatoes. I think they would've been better if they had been cut into smaller pieces.   We got seated right away late on a Friday night, but it was still very busy. I would definitely recommend a reservation here."}
{"text":"I am staying at a hotel around the corner from this restaurant and called to see if there was a table for 2; I was told there was one available outside if I came right away.  I arrived 5 minutes later to be told the table was gone and it would be over an hour wait to get another table.  The 3 hostesses were curt and acted like they were guarding a castle.  We sat and ordered at the bar and were entertained by the head bartender named Cecil who could give the hostesses some lessons in diplomacy.  The entire time we sat at the bar and ate (and our food was good), there were 3 unoccupied tables.    I'd go again, but I plan to contact the manager about the cranky \"keepers of the gate.\" They almost ruined the whole experience."}
{"text":"Love the restaurant except the music is Too Loud!  Table next to ours requested that volume be decreased in addition to our request.  We were advised that the DJ controls. H-mmmm. It is not a music venue."}
{"text":"Had the house salad and roasted chicken.   The dish was outstanding as it was the most moist piece of chicken I've had in a long time.  Paired it with a Helltown IPA.    Service was great."}
{"text":"Wonderful spot in the theater/cultural district of Pittsburgh. Spent a lovely evening on their porch drinking some really well-done and unique cocktails and eating a variety of appetizers. Everything was wonderful."}
{"text":"The buffalo chicken Mac and Cheese was  exceptional and the Bartenders were awesome. The can make every drink and there service was top notch."}
{"text":"I didn't want to like M&P going in, as I had read reviews about rude service.  Yes our waitress wasnt warm, but it was only because the place was so packed (8pm Wednesday) that the servers were scuttling just to stay above water.  Service was outstanding, crisp and polite.  Now the food.  Shad roe appetizer and tuna tartare appetizer were both perfect. I had the mussels with coconut lemongrass sauce which surpassed my prior favorite at Pointe Brugge by a mile.  Plus M&P grills their bread, which makes for better sauce dipping.  My guest had a steak, and said it was \"better than Capital Grille.\"  Finally, the frites with truffle mayo and the fried Brussels sprouts were both phenomenal sides.  I intend to return to see if M&P remains a 5 star in my book."}
{"text":"ERMAHGAWD. Really, thats all I can say. This place was UNBELIEVABLE. To this day, I continue to say this is the best meal I have EVER had. I LOVE the atmosphere, is it upscale? Yes, is it a bar? Yes! Thats the best part, I would feel comfortable in jeans and a polo, just as much as I would in a full suit. No one here is discriminated from this dress code. The beer selection was great, but know whats even better is their drink selection. You know you've found a good place when you ask the bartender what you should get, and he asks what you're feeling. At that point you let him do his magic, and you sit back and relax. Is it a little pricier? Of course, but did I mention this is probably my favorite food I have ever had? Because it was, the best meal I have ever had. The fiance ordered the fried pickles, and the dipping sauce AND pickles were both incredible. I got conned into ordering their fried tatters (French fries, and he really had to force me to order them *not*) and I also ordered the mammoth pork thingy. I say thingy because calling it a pork chop does NOT do it justice. Think... Consistency of a steak, taste of heaven, with some BBQ flare in there as well. The collard greens were not something I enjoyed but thats because I am just not a fan of them. The pork was honestly just incredible. The french fries (I forgot to write about these earlier) were ALSO perfect. Truffle oil, and an incredible Garlic Aoli that I wanted to be buried in a vat of. With this being said, the service is ALSO incredible. Please go visit, and have the meal of a lifetime!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch and ordered the Turkey Melt-it was laden with layers of dense, dry turkey and I couldn't even cut through the bottom layer of bread, never did find out whether it was burnt or otherwise. Left 3/4 of it on the plate."}
{"text":"I love this place!  I couldn't wait to try it when my boyfriend and I came to visit Pittsburgh one weekend because he is obviously, a meat & potatoes guy.  We were pretty hungry, yet wanted to save room for their 34 oz. Ribeye.  He started with a caesar salad.  It was different, but very delicious.  The crispy pig ears and chicarrones added a great crunch to the salad since it was sans crouton like the usual.  The boyfriend really enjoyed it.  Meanwhile, I had the fried pickles and devils on horseback lol.  The fried pickles were great, but I wasn't too into the devils on horseback.  I've had them differently at many other places, so a description with what's in it would've been nice.  But when the Ribeye for two came, we couldn't wait to dig in.  First off, we were seated at a tiny table, so the wood board basically took up the entire table.  But the seating was very comfortable because I had the booth side, which was similar to a comfy couch.  They gave us little plates.  Although there was a lot of fat on the steak, it was still a really good amount of meat as well.  It was cooked perfectly and the wait did not feel long at all.  We got the mushroom ragu on the side and they put it into a dish for us.  Steak fries were crispy and delicious, but we were pretty full from the steak.  We also added a side of mac & cheese to have with the steak.  All in all, we had a great experience and wish we lived closer so we can come back.  Meat & Potatoes was also located in a great area and the bar looked like it'd be a good spot to grab drinks before a night out.  The ambiance was great."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch on Sunday. The bar menu sounded fantastic with such unique options for bloody marys, I couldn't wait to arrive.   I ordered a dill pickle and jalapeño infused vodka bloody. The server came back with a glass of ice and vodka. I didn't realize it was a make your own, interactive thing. That was really fun and my garnishes were real out of control. The vodka on its own was really delicious, and so was the final drink.  My date ordered the morning mule which tasted fantastic with the fresh ginger and prosecco. This is officially my 2nd favorite mule of all time.  We then ordered the kimchi bloody which was good and the seelbach, which was fantastic and knocked me on my A.  To eat, I ordered the burger, sans bun.  I didn't want fries so I asked for salad mix or a vegetable and I was advised there was nothing like that on the brunch menu and no, I could not have it. Seriously, not a single vegetable to be had. Odd, and highly disappointing. The burger was ok, though the condiment choices did not make sense to me. One was ketchup and one was a pink mayo based chunky sauce of sorts. Neither enhanced my burger and in fact, both took away from the burger. Maybe a grainy mustard or an au jus or something more appropriate.  My date ordered chicken and waffles and literally it was a huge waffle with 5 boned chicken parts. Totally not what he expected, considering you basically had to eat the chicken with your hands and part of chice and waffles is covering the whole thing with maple syrup... It was a complete mess and very uncomfortable looking. He advised it tasted good, after I let him know it's not his fault if he left looking like a 2 year old with food all over himself.  All-in-all, the experience was ok. They def make one great cocktails. The food left a bit to be desired."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant in Pittsburgh by far.  The food is great and the drinks are even better. The bartenders are very very nice. It's difficult to get in at times, so make a reservation in advance!!  Come on a weekend and get brunch! They have a 5$ Bloody Mary bar and it is so amazing. They infuse their own vodka, gin and tequila for the Bloody Mary bar and you won't be disappointed.  Best Bloody Mary in town."}
{"text":"Worst service ever and the bar service sets a new low for customer satisfaction. Wouldn't recommend this to any person"}
{"text":"This is the start of my downtown food adventure and I'm very pleased with it. Been there for both lunch and dinner and I prefer dinner in this place. The famous  meat and potato dish is huge! and tasty. Their fries are soooo good. Bone marrow is decent but I've had better. As for appetizers we ordered several dishes, while they're fun in concept, I find these to be less impressive. Will def be back to this place b/c I wanna try their cocktails and hubby is constantly craving their steak."}
{"text":"Rather disappointed in their brunch. I joined a few friends at 11:30 on a Saturday for brunch. I was excited to try MNP since everyone raves about this place. We arrived on time and were taken to our table by the bar. The restaurant was busy but not packed. We ordered our drinks and then waited.  .  And waited. . .  And waited. It took our server 30 minutes to take our order. Having 7 years of restaurant experience I was dumbfounded that it took this long. I'm honestly still in shock. When our server finally made his way over to our table, I ordered the special pancakes- cornmeal with lemon and blueberry. Our food also took quite a long time so our waiter provided us with monkey bread to share as an appetizer on the house. The monkey bread aka glorified cinnamon roll was a sugar explosion in my mouth. Yummm. I liked it so much I took one to go with the intention of giving it to my husband but ate half of it myself later on. As far as my pancakes were concerned, I wasn't as impressed. They tasted like cornbread with blueberries. I wasn't able to find the lemon at all. Another disappointment, the syrup. I was given standard maple syrup. The dish could have easily become 4 stars with a warm blueberry sauce or lemon creme anglaise. I also ordered a side of the peppered bacon with my pancakes. The bacon was delicious and savory. It added another dimension of flavor to an otherwise bland meal. All in all, I would not return to MNP for brunch. But, I do want to give dinner a try for some (hopefully) delicious meats and potatoes."}
{"text":"The best place to eat in down town Pitt when you consider everything. We have been about 5 times.   Drinks: Good price. Amazing value. The make the best old fashions in town. Seriously. Just try theirs. For brunch, get the Bloody Mary bar option. You will thank me.   Speaking of brunch I have ordered the short rib hash and poached eggs twice and I will order again. Ridiculous. $12. They could charge more and it would pay.   The wife bought the fried chicken and waffles. Also ridiculous. Chicken was moist and flavorful. Some would say spicy but tame for us. The real hero was the syrup. The bourbon, bacon infused syrup was so unique and flavorful it almost goes unnoticed in its small dish they serve it in.   Pork belly tacos are great!  The only item we ordered that didn't stack up to every other item was the lamb burger. It was good but compared to everything else they serve this was at the bottom of the list."}
{"text":"Stopped in last weekend on Valentine's day. Great atmosphere and service. Took a tour of the menu starting with the fried pickles, taters, and bread. Got the dark n stormy off the cocktail list. Everything was fantastic - on par with it's sister restaurants."}
{"text":"I love Meat & Potatoes.  You'll love it, too. Make a reservation!  I've been there a few times now and it's been fricken awesome every. single. time.   The first time I went there, it was Pgh Restaurant Week and they offered a 5 course tasting menu. It was the first time I'd ever had marrow. And if you are thinking, \"Ew! Marrow??\" Believe me. I was the same...until I ate it. And it was delicious.  Everything else we ate that night was also delicious. Fried chicken and jalapeno waffles. Sweetbread tacos. Grilled bread w/ goat butter and rhubarb jam....  Sweet baby J. Can I tell you about that grilled bread??  GET IT.  It is offered as an app at brunch AND dinner, so no matter what time of day you are there, you can get it and you should. It's probably what God eats for breakfast.  Spare rib hash for brunch? DO IT.  So basically what I am saying is...The food is great. The service is also great - every time I've called to make a reservation (and I'm always last-minute b/c I'm a procrastinator), they've gone out of their way to fit us in.   If I could marry a restaurant, I'd marry this one."}
{"text":"We went here after work on a Tuesday; around 7:00 - I didn't think it would be busy, but they had no tables open until 9:00. We were directed to the bar and were delighted to see that two seats had just opened up.   We sat down, were greeted and given water and menus.   That was it.   Ten minutes later we got up and left because no one cared to take out drink order or answer questions about the menu.   It was busy, yes. But that is no excuse for rudeness. If you can't handle the crowds, pull back a bit on your profit motive and hire more wait staff or Leo something else.   We were very disappointed because of all the good reviews we saw on yelp. Maybe those reviews only pertained to table service."}
{"text":"Stellar all the way around.  Tends to be quite busy on theater weekends but other wise delightful atmosphere, killer food and killer drinks.  Awesome.  I recommend it constantly to friends and acquaintances."}
{"text":"Love everything from the decor to fried pickles to the hanger steak. The only thing I'm sad about is that I'm seven hours from Pittsburgh, but it's worth the trip. Oh, the drinks were amazing too. Not a lot to choose from for beer, but they do have a full bar."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for lunch with our 20 month old daughter.  We did not have a reservation which was not a problem.  They were accommodating with a high chair and very friendly from the start.   We ordered the pickle chips (which were good) and fried Brussels (which were fantastic). For the entree my husband had the burger.  It was delicious.  Cooked to perfection and the tomato jam was a tasty touch.  I had the mussels.  They were equally awesome. The coconut and spices were so complimentary.  Also, it was a hefty portion with some crusty bread to soak up the leftover juices.    We're hoping to get back there for date night some other time but it's nice we could try it for lunch since we had our daughter with us."}
{"text":"The first time we had been was for our anniversary on 9/24/16.  The food and service were both great.  We did have some issues though which is why there is only a 3 star rating.  If it hadn't been for the food and service being so good, probably would've given a 1 star due to the issues being listed below.  First off, the lighting, like so many other high end restaurants was horrible.  I will never understand putting out such stunning looking food and then having basically no lights in the dining room at all for the patrons to see how beautiful the food looks.  Secondly, the night we were there, the draft beer system was down.  While this most likely isn't an everyday occurrence, it still was an issue the night we were there.  Third, the tables are so crammed together, you're basically eating dinner with complete strangers sitting in your lap.  The tables are literally only about 18 inches apart.  It makes for a romantic evening not being romantic at all with having the feeling of complete strangers sitting at the table with you, but hey, anything to make more of the all mighty dollar I guess.  And lastly, my brother in law ordered a gift card online for us for Christmas 2015.  We brought in the printout and the server told us that we needed the actual card.  To date, neither my wife and I, nor my brother in law's family has ever received this card our server was talking about.  I don't see how it takes more than 10 months for a gift card to be mailed from Pittsburgh to Cranberry Township or to Lakewood, OH so it just seems like the restaurant took a $25 donation for absolutely nothing.  It's sad since the food and service were so good that I don't believe we will be returning.  As good as the food and service was, it does not outweigh the issues, especially just taking money from my brother in law and giving absolutely nothing in return.  Once again though, anything to make more of the all mighty dollar, including not honoring or sending gift cards even though money was exchanged for the gift card.  Definitely a way to make more money by charging for a gift card then not ever sending it."}
{"text":"Really wasn't my cup of tea here. However he staff and service was great they really have a great atmosphere. It was very crowded and the wait was very long. I was disappointed in the food, I expected much better than what I got but it's ok! There are many places to eat downtown"}
{"text":"I will NEVER eat here! We were lied to and discriminated against today. A further explanation is in this video. We were basically turned away! https://youtu.be/ory51Myb_sw"}
{"text":"Fried pickles, man. All I gotta say. My friend and I ate here for lunch one day and we were completely silenced after taking our first bite--an occurrence that has only happened here because we were in awe of how...insanely amazing everything tasted. Every bite is savory and they have great drinks available. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"We really enjoy M&P. We've been several times since moving to Pittsburgh. What we like most is that we can pop in just before and show and stop at the bar or wait for a table. Though it can be more than 30 minutes they are always helpful with getting you in and out quickly. The food is awesome. I really enjoyed the large steak for two. The service is also very good -- we've never had a bad server and the bartenders are also very friendly."}
{"text":"If you want to eat marrow out of Bambi's leg bones, this is the place."}
{"text":"Pretty good place for dinner.  Went with a colleague after work as we were both from out of town.  It was busy and it was a weekday."}
{"text":"Such a lovely establishment! Oh Pittsburgh, you get better and better every visit. Even dahntahn is flourishing!  My friends and I went to Meat & Potatoes as a last stop on the latest Pittsburgh adventure. We decided on brunch, which apparently gets booked out for reservations, so you might want to plan ahead. Luckily the (very large) bar area remains unbooked and the bartenders do take good care of their customers.   While I very much liked all the food I tried - including the MASSIVE grilled cheese and tomato soup, and the truffled fried potatoes. The portion sizes seem to vary quite a bit from dish to dish, i.e. the steak and eggs is tiny.  The highlight for brunch was the Bloody Mary buffet bar. That's right a buffet for Bloody Marys. You order the Bloody Mary, so they pour you infused liquor (jalapeno-infused tequila, bacon-inflused vodka, etc.), and then you go up to the bar for allll the fixings. And there are A LOT of fixings, including all different types of hot sauces.  I look forward to trying dinner on a future visit!"}
{"text":"Love this place. I was in Pittsburgh for a business trip and I really wanted to try a good place to dine downtown. Every body recommended the Primanti Bros, and no..I didn't want that. It didn't fit in my mouth. Then, someone I worked with recommended this place and Nola. I chose Meat and Potatoes as I didn't find it necessary to eat Cajun food in Pittsburgh. My coworker, Joe, and I had to wait about 30 minutes before we got sat. At first, they said 1 hour. But nice that they offered to call so we could at least walk around. So, I definitely recommend to make a reservation. It's definitely the happening place in town. When we were walking around, none of the nearby restaurants were half as crowded as Meat & Potatoes. The foods were awesome too, and I had a hard time ordering as I wanted to try several things. Joe was daring and ordered bone marrow for us to try for appetizer. He asked me if I had it - of course, I had. There aren't that many things I haven't tried. Well, it was his first time. He lost his bone marrow virginity that night. He liked it. I ordered one of my favorite meals ever, moules frites which were mussels and fries. It was tasty. Joe ordered gnocchi with short ribs. I loved my meal and if I were in town again, I'd come back in a heart beat."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon Meat & Potatoes after arriving in Pittsburgh. I decided to take my chances and walk in without a reservation. They had over and hour wait - which I expected. The hostess did let me know that they had bar seating with full service. Their bar was also super packed, but I let the bartender know I was looking to grab a seat and ordered a drink in the meanwhile. As soon as someone was paying their check the bartender gave me a heads up and I was able to settle in.   I ordered a Bloody Mary because that's what I'm into these days. They have a DIY BM bar - first you choose your liquor and you get handed a glass, with a decent pour of said liquor. I went with chipotle pepper vodka, cause who doesn't love an extra kick. Then you head over to this assembly line where you dress your BM with different meats, cheeses and vegetables and then top off your liquor with the BM mix. I wish I was better at this whole dressing thing, but it is clearly not a strong point of mine. However, it was an experience and I was slightly buzzed after just one glass. It was STRONG.   Since I was there for brunch, I ordered the Brisket Hash. Everything about it was to die for. The eggs were properly poached, it had the right amount of truffle oil, and the potatoes were delicious. I wish the serving size was slightly bigger but it was still everything I wished it would be.   I would definitely come back to try out some more of their menu. If you are in Pittsburgh - this is a must."}
{"text":"The food was exceptional and service equally noteworthy, but my wife & I were seated at a table that, at best, was a cocktail table which was dwarfed by the \"Meat & Potatoes for Two\" (34oz tomahawk ribeye with all the trimmings) we selected for dinner.  It came on a butcher block cutting board that took up the whole table - no room for plates, so when asked by the waiter on being served \"is there anything else I can get you?\" my response was \"Yeah, a bigger table!\"  We had reservations, made over two weeks in advance - next time, Mr DeShantz, seat us at a real table or if you don't have one, then don't take the reservation!!!"}
{"text":"Friends kept telling us to have brunch here.  Finally got a chance to come today.  They were out of the chicken and waffles but the pork belly burrito was amazing.  The beer the selection is amazing.  Great staff and great atmosphere.  Can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"Pioneering restaurant and an inspiration to all else that is trendy and delicious.  One of the first in the city to deliver such a strong mix of cocktail ingenuity and a menu of pure indulgence. Up to this point we have tried it all. Love this place. Don't miss brunch either with a tremendous Bloody Mary bar. Strong recommend the chicken and waffles. ."}
{"text":"I generally do not like bloody marys but loved the bloody mary bar at Meat & Potatoes!!  They have a variety of infused vodkas to choose from and a huge spread of condiments to add - almost could be a meal in itself!  For brunch I had a hard time choosing what to order because everything on the menu sounded so good.  Ended up going with the housemade granola and huevos rancheros which were both delicious and big portions.  Cool, trendy place with great food & drinks!"}
{"text":"Hands down, one of my absolute favorite spots to eat.  Last time we went there, the kitchen reduced the sauce on my pot roast too much, resulting in a very salty dinner.  The manager spotted my expression almost instantaneously, and came over to make it right.  It's apparent that they care very much about their clientele, that their staff pays attention to your first bite to make sure you're happy with their product.  I ordered the lamb steak and it was simply marvelous.  You will have to either come late (after 9pm) or put in a reservation well in advance.  They make old time cocktails and have a very speakeasy vibe."}
{"text":"Visited this spot 4 times over a 2 week visit to Pittsburgh. I've had dinner twice, and brunch twice. Every visit has been consistently tasty. Both dinners were after a show across the street, around 10:30pm. Sat outside with show mates and had a bit of everything-pappardelle pasta with short rib, Brussels sprouts, bone marrow (ridiculously huge portion for what you pay--ask for extra bread with it), fried pickles, the salty flatbread-just a lot of food. Everything was incredibly good, and not over seasoned. Came back on another beautiful night for a repeat of the pasta sitting at the bar-- my best meal of all. Drinks were stellar--including this bourbon/balsamic/basil treat that I repeated both nights. Brunch was also incredible. Chicken and waffles can easily be split--basically a half chicken worth of poultry on a big waffle. Chicken is different from other fried chicken--almost double fried, and tasty enough to eat the skin by itself--really memorable. I've had a lot of gastropub/contemporary american meals on the road this year, and this place, for many reasons, is by far the most memorable of the bunch."}
{"text":"The main course was just ok but that may have just been because of how full i was from appetizers which were incredible. The mac and cheese was especially amazing and a must try."}
{"text":"Best cocktails in Pittsburgh. The bone marrow, wings and Mac n Cheese are excellent. The only downside is trying to make a reservation between 5 and 10."}
{"text":"Meat & Potatoes is my favorite go to brunch spot in the city. It's mainly reservation only but you can always wait a 10-20 minutes and they'll seat you at the bar if nothing is available, which is delightful. I've tried the Irish Benedict and Short Rib Hash. Both amazing but I like the Benedict better for brunch. The short rib hash is unbelievably flavorful in a amazing way. The eggs are always poached to perfection and hollandaise on both is superb."}
{"text":"Awesome decor. Great food. Good service. Cheese on the cheese plate left something to be desired but the bread and jam was amazing. Fries pickles were delicious and the GIANT ribeye with marrow and fries was so amazing! We are every bite of the 36 oz portion.  Great prices too!!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to get to Meat & Potatoes since it opened a few years back. My interest was piqued recently when I read a Thrillist article that said they had the second best burger in Pittsburgh.   We arrived at 5:30PM on a Friday. I had made reservations earlier in the week. There were still a few tables open, but it was pretty busy. The seating was a little tight, but not bad.   We started off with the pigs ears and poutine appetizers. We devoured the poutine but left the pigs ears relatively untouched...not the taste for us. They were drenched in a tangy, asian-style sauce that you'll either love or hate. The poutine was amazing, the fries were great and hot, but it was very filling!  My husband and I both got the burgers. We both agreed that they were some of the best that we've had, especially considering the price point, only $11. The meat was great, they were cooked to order. Would absolutely order again.   We finished the meal with the chocolate pot dessert, which came highly recommended. It was smooth and delicious. Though, for my fellow chocoholics, I would be remiss if I didn't say it wasn't THAT chocolately and I still craved a little chocolate after I was done.   The service was impeccable. The waiter was attentive, informative, and patient. Some of the best service we've had in Pittsburgh to date. We will definitely be back to Meat & Potatoes."}
{"text":"We walked to meat and potatoes from our hotel. We didn't have a reservation but we asked if we could sit outside and were seated within 5 minutes. Our waitress was very nice and accomadting. We ordered two of the spring salads which were very good ( I thought they were a little over priced at $11) we shared the roasted chicken which was very well seasoned and we'll cooked. We're thinking about going back to try the brunch tomorrow. All in all it was a very nice place to eat in the theater district."}
{"text":"Oh my!  This was so flipping good!  I had the meatloaf and my sister had the pot roast, both so good.  Total comfort food.  The featured wine was an excellent cab and our server was really nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Good but not great. The restaurant and how the hostess acted felt weirdly bougie in a way that didn't match up with the restaurant...liked my food but not sure if I would come back. Cool on the inside though"}
{"text":"I wish I could give 3.5 stars rather than 4, but I decided to give Meat & Potatoes 4 stars due to the service, drinks, and dessert. I would really only go back to M&P for their drinks and dessert, but not for their main courses. I fully recommend getting their special drinks and the Pot de crème. I would also recommend NOT getting the Meat & Potatoes for 2.   I ordered 2 drinks: Fig & Rye and Pimm's Blue Ribbon. Both drinks were perfectly balanced and excellent - perfect mix of sweet, sour, floral-y, and just enough to mask the bitter alcohol flavor. I'm a big fan of their drinks now.   I've heard so many people compliment the \"Meat & Potatoes for 2,\" so obviously I had to try that, but really it was a disappointment. We ordered it to be medium, yet when we got our meal the first time, the steak was rare and too underdone. After we told the waiter, he sent our meal back and we waited to get a new one. We had already waited 45 minutes for our meal since we wanted it medium, and had to wait another 20 minutes to get a new one. When we got it the second time, we expected it to be perfectly cooked. Even though it was closer to medium than the first one, the middle of the steak was completely raw. We ate around the raw part since we didn't want to wait again.   I had told the waiter about this just to let them know that we weren't completely satisfied, and when the manager came over he told us that we should've told them again. I felt like he was lecturing me because I didn't request for a new meal again, but I wasn't prepared to wait another 20 minutes and get the same meal a third time...Instead, he comped our appetizer and our dessert. I thought this gesture was extremely kind, but to be honest, I just wanted to have a good steak. I would say that the flavor of the steak is nothing special, and for a place called \"Meat & Potatoes\" it does disappoint. I've had steaks that are way better. I wish I had ordered something else off their menu.   Other components of the \"2,\" were bone marrow, mushroom ragu, and fries. The bone marrow was unpleasant....I'm not a big fan of gelatinous textures especially of savory foods, and really I felt like I was eating pure fat covered in salty parmesan. The mushroom ragu was standard. The fries were good because they were super crispy on the outside but soft in the inside.   I think what really made me give M&P 4 stars was the dessert. We ordered the Pot de Crème and S'mores. The s'mores was nothing special and I sort of regret ordering it. The pot de crème was AMAZING. It was a chocolate version, but it reminded me of toffee and nougat. I wish they had told us that there would be nuts on top of it since I am allergic to nuts, but luckily the nights only touched the top (whipped cream) and not the rest of the jar. It was super silky, creamy, and had the perfect amount of sweetness.   I would say that M&P is not worth raving about, but it is worth a try."}
{"text":"Awesome decor and really good food. Inside the theater arena and is open until late to grab a drink or some great people watching !!  Cocktails,vibes and people - best in Pittsburgh !!"}
{"text":"So I ate at Meat & Potatoes for the first time last weekend and honestly I was so disappointed. After reading all the great reviews I had high hopes for this place but I was not impressed at all.  First off I love the decor and the atmosphere. They really did a great job with that.  Also the service we had was great. Our waitress was the best. I would say she was probably one of the best waitresses I've ever had at a restaurant. I give her 5 stars.  But unfortunately the food was just not that great. They have a great idea but just something was missing and not quite all there with each dish. Don't get me wrong the food isn't bad I just don't think it's worth going back for a second time. There's so many great restaurants in Pittsburgh I don't think I'll waste my time eating @ Meat & Potatoes again. I do have to give props to them for the dessert. We ordered the s'mores dessert which came out in a small cast iron dish that was warm, it was awesome! If you do decide to eat here definitely order the s'mores desert."}
{"text":"LOVED it Visiting from Los Angeles I was ready to be unimpressed, but I went for brunch and was immediately taken by the ambiance... the food. You can't go wrong with anything you order. Prepare to be wheeled out of there."}
{"text":"A great place for a family or romantic dinner (for meat lovers of course) with great food and beverages and magnificent service. I always try their bone marrow. It is simply delicious. My other favorite dish is their huge ribeye steak.  Weak point of my last visit that cost the place one star: the ribeye steak had too much fat, it was undercooked relative to my order And of course the prices are so high.  I will pay more visits to this place and won't hesitate to bring my loved ones."}
{"text":"It was fun!  Service was excellent and the food was really good.  The menu could've used a filet or NY strip steak, as the name is MEAT and potatoes"}
{"text":"The appetizers, the entrees, the drinks, the ambiance, everything was AMAZING!!! I would go back here in a heartbeat!  For appetizers we tried out the fried brussel sprouts, poutine, bone marrow and steak tartare and the short rib flatbread and EVERYTHING was delicious.  I've never been a big fan of brussel sprouts, but with the crispyness on the outside and tangy dipping sauce, I'd get them every time at Meat & Potatoes.  I had the short rib bolognese for dinner. I highly recommend it! The chunks of short rib just melt in your mouth.  My boyfriend had the flat iron steak and he liked it as well.  The place was very nicely decorated.  You could meet up here for a drink after work around the center bar or a nice dinner date.  (the chairs are super comfy!)  I hope to make it back for brunch sometime!"}
{"text":"The poutine is my go to snack/appetitizer if you're looking for a snack. This time I opted for the brisket mac & cheese rather than choosing a main course (Waygu flat iron is my favorite) and I was not disappointed. The brisket just pulled apart with just your fork and was amazing with the Mac & cheese! One of my favorite restaurants no doubt!"}
{"text":"The menu is interesting i.e. bone marrow,  Fried Chicken livers, and sprouts.  I had hanger steak and finger potatos which was very tasty.  However, I was not blown away by the place.  Cool bar seen trendy with Edison style bulbs.  The seats were weird and had bad springs.  It's apparently THE place to be."}
{"text":"Was out doing the yearly visit to Pittsburgh and decided it was time to do some fine dining.  I came across Meat & Potatoes through Yelp, and secured a reservation.  Since there were only two of us, we decided to forego the main course and just stick with the mouthwatering appetizers.    In order of favorites (tartare and bone marrow may have been tied, to be honest):  *Tartare - perfectly boiled egg with solid protein, and runny yolk served on top of a heaping portion of steak tartare.  I don't know if it was the egg, the seaweed aioli, or the dry aged steak, but the flavors of this dish just worked!  Must have if we return! *Bone Marrow - not one, not two, but FOUR tyrannosaurus rex sized bones!  There was toasted bread and an assortment of toppers (sea salt, capers, etc) as well.  Needless to say, the two of us didn't finish all 4 bones. *Fried Pickles - thick, half-inch cut circles deep fried perfectly and with great side of spicy ranch.  We asked for an additional side of the truffle mayo ($1 charge) for dipping options.   *Poutine - probably our least favorite dish, and why this place can't get 5 stars in my book.  The flavors overall were good but the fries were overly salted, and the curds were almost non-existent, and the dish really didn't stand up in any way.  Overall, I'd definitely consider coming back to Meat & Potatoes next year!  If I lived in Pittsburgh, I would definitely become a regular."}
{"text":"My beau and I dined here two nights ago (yes, New Year's!) with an OpenTable reservation and coupons for two libations in tow. While I should've heeded the OpenTable warnings of limited menus and whatnot (being vegetarian and all), we head forth into the treacherous territory of carnivores.  I had heard great things from friends (...aka Yelp) and felt that I had to check it out. The sole vegetarian option was limited to brussel sprout salad, which seemed fairly unsexy compared to the other items on the menu. Jaren L. (my dining partner) ordered this, while I ventured away from my beloved legumes and ordered the carbonara pasta with pancetta. (I'm used to making concessions around my family and when traveling to foreign countries.) While I certainly would've preferred visiting on a day where they offered a more expansive menu, my dish was *quite* rich and tasty.  The highlight was definitely the cocktails we ordered. I had the Old Canadian - a concoction of bourbon, meringue, and maple, with a splash of vanilla and citrus. Absolutely divine! I wound up trading with my boyfriend midway through, who had gotten the Ronaldo (HOUSEMADE raspberry vodka, grenadine, and citrus), simply because both of our drinks were just so good.  I will definitely be back on another day to try their \"normal\" menu. Service was decent, but what really sold me was their aesthetic. I'm such a sucker for good marketing, design, and ambiance - all coupled with tasty drinks and food!"}
{"text":"Lively place to get a goo meal. Service was great, and the food was even better."}
{"text":"Meat and Potatoes is a very good spot that comes with a fairly high price tag but delivers decently well for the price. The food is good and there are a great selection of cocktails.  That being said don't expect to have your socks blown off. Its good but not great. With a name like Meat and potatoes I would have liked to see more steak choices.   Give the place a shot."}
{"text":"It's like the chefs at Meat and Potatoes can read my thoughts, and know all my secret food fantasies.   Fried Chicken Livers-- Yes! Poutine-- More! Mac & Cheese with pork belly-- Gasp! Bone Marrow, and Kobe tartare, and Quail-- Oh My!  The space, the food, the drinks, they just all work together perfectly. The space and design is kind of \"rustic hipster,\" if that's a thing. It works perfectly for a late dinner after the opera, or a casual meet up with friends. The menus are printed and presented in a black manila folder, and specials are written on a blackboard. The service is casual but competent. That is, you feel like your server is in on the whole concept of the place; they're invested, and they're not out of place. Everything was fresh, tasted homemade, and the portions were bigger than I anticipated. One of the best parts is that it's not expensive. We had 3 people, each with a drink, and each took home food, for ~$70 total.   And they've got a brunch?? I'm just too excited for words."}
{"text":"Loved it!!!   The food was really good and unique, the decor was beautiful and there's a great outdoor seating area!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick appetizer - had the Brussels and the Pork Wing  Awesome. Upper bar is right on the money. I could chill here til the next episode.   Get. The. Mule.  Hot sauce."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! We decided to go to Pittsburgh on a whim for some shopping so I didn't do any research or make reservations anywhere in advance. After some lurking around Yelp, I decided I had to come here due to the sheer amount of great reviews, and c'mon, who doesn't love some meat and potatoes?!   When we got there (without a reservation) we were told that the restaurant was booked solid until 10pm. Sadly, we were about to leave when a space opened up for 2 in about 45 minutes! I was overjoyed! There's a separate lobby from the restaurant right outside with some nice comfy couches so we sat there and waited. Also, there's a small bar that's in the same building as the restaurant that featured live music on a stage. Next time I will research more wisely so I can do both.   The table ended up being open a bit earlier than expected so we were seated promptly. The ambiance of the restaurant was dimly lit without too much noise so it was perfect for a romantic dinner for 2, as was the case when I looked around, there were lots of couples out for a nice dinner together.   Our waitress was very nice and gladly answered all the questions we had in addition to making some great recommendations in regards to drinks - she knew her stuff! We settled on getting the deep fried chicken liver and mac and cheese to start followed by the 34oz ribeye steak with potatoes and bone marrow as an entree. Let me tell you, BIG MISTAKE because the starters were so rich and filling that we were already nearly full when the big entree came. Our eyes were far too big for our stomachs.   The chicken liver was delicious. It was battered and deep fried a bit rare, as the waitress had warned us it would be a bit pink inside. I wouldn't recommend it if you're squeamish with the idea of anything coming from a chicken being a bit rare. The mac and cheese was SO RICH and super CHEESY. It came with pulled pork and chorizo. The cheesiness was definitely there however there was barely any meat that I could notice.   Now, onto the big one. The 34oz ribeye was perfection (called \"meat & potatoes\" on the menu). It came on a cutting board that took up most of our table so we just ate straight of the board (channeling our inner caveman). The ribeye was perfectly charred, cooked medium rare with the (HUGE) bone in, and seasoned just right. It came with 2 sauces on the side for the potatoes. The bone marrow gratin was also quite good however I wish that they had provided a few pieces of crusty bread to eat it with. I ended up just using the potato to spread it on (is that what I'm supposed to do?). The potatoes were very crispy on the outside and soft and moist on the inside. Unfortunately we were barely able to finish half of it so we had to get it to go.   Next time (there WILL be a next time) I think we'll just get the ribeye alone as it's more than enough for 2 people. They also have daily specials as well. When we went they had mussels 3 different ways that was very popular. Nearly every table ordered them!  It's been a few weeks since we've returned to Toronto but I still think about this amazing meal! I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate a new job and it lived up to its hype! As a person who loves vegetables and is not a big meat eater, I feel like I would eat meat more if it was prepared the way it is here. I had the duck entree and my boyfriend had the flat iron. Both were delicious and the meat melts in your mouth. I would definitely recommend coming here, but would also suggest making a reservation"}
{"text":"We had a bad server who rarely came to our table and overcharged us, drinks were great. Music is kept so loud you have to scream to be heard"}
{"text":"I'm pretty in love with this place.  Not a fan of the wait or the never-anything-available-at-the-time-I-want reservation system, but the food speaks for itself.      I have been to the bar once or twice and come for brunch, but most recently it was dinner.  Here's what we had:   - The 34 ounce ribeye.  So I didn't actually order this, but I was sitting at the bar waiting for my friends and the people got one.  Served on a big wooden cutting board, it screams \"caveman\" with a big bone sticking up off the side.  It was huge and meaty and looked divine.   My friend arrived and we were discussing what to order when I said \"I'd love to order that steak, but a couple of us would have to share it.\"  The folks next to us *(perfect strangers) said \"it's amazing - don't order it - have some of ours and then try something else from the menu\".  They then proceeded to hack off a 6 ounce hunk and put it on my little bread plate with some mushrooms and a potato wedge (people are just awesome sometimes).   And they were right - it was amazing.  Tender and well-seasoned - cooked to perfection.  I will definitely be coming back for it with the boyfriend.     - The curry mussels.  Having had kind of an impromptu meal at the bar, I decided on the mussels as my entrée at the table.  The broth was the best mussel broth I have ever had.  I actually packed up the leftover broth in a to-go container and plan to pour it on some chicken and rice this evening for dinner.  The mussel portion was large and you can get some fries or bread on the side if you want round out the meal.      - The pot de crème.  I'm not a huge dessert person, but I was told I HAD to order this.  This was rich and chocolaty without being super heavy or overly sweet.  The perfect end to my meal and definitely a dessert I would recommend.    I also sampled the pot roast and some sort of lemon pie (in a mason jar) that were really great.   Everyone loved every bite and every cocktail (did I mention that they have all kinds of handmade goodies in that department?)   Brunch is just as amazing as dinner - I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food and beer was amazing but the service of the bartenders was phenomenal. They both made sure to figure out how hungry I was so I could enjoy each plate. Bone marrow and chicken mac was amazing."}
{"text":"Never had a better brunch. Four starts becuase dinner is just OK. Great staff too"}
{"text":"The food was awesome. Not cheep but we'll worth the money . I had the chili mussels as an appetizer and the were the best mussels I ever had. I should have stopped at that and just use the bread to dip into the juice. Their servers were awesome. They were fast and attentive and our waitress (Jeasica) made all of the recommendations and they were spot on. She was the best waitress i had . Ever......I am coming back latter in the year to Pittsburgh and I will come back. I would even do the 4 hour drive from Philadelphia for the mussels.  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Place is beyond delicious. Had the mushroom risotto and could have eaten a million more servings of it. Went with a group of people and no one left hungry or disappointed. If you are in Pittsburgh you must try!!"}
{"text":"Caveat:  I ate neither meat nor potatoes, but I think I tried everything else on the menu.   The atmosphere is ...a little weird.  You have enter through the theater, but once inside the restaurant it's great.  Sort of French bistro meets bordello.  (That makes sense to me).  The chairs at the tables are realllllly comfortable, so much so that we were afraid we were going to fall asleep after eating and drinking too much.   We started with a bevy of appetizers - short ribs flatbread with arugula and gorgonzola was very tasty, as were the fried chicken livers.  The bone marrow, though, took the day.  It was a *huge* portion - easily three times what I've had in other restaurants.    For dinner I had the pappardelle, my second choice because they were out of veal shank.  It was excellent - and you can always rely upon me to get pasta no matter where I go.  The noodles were definitely homemade by someone, and the sauce had more flavor than most bologneses I've tried.  Lesley had the \"Pig dip,\" which looked amazing.  Erin was less than thrilled with the Kobe beef, but Tim loved his hot dog.  Yes, a $12 hot dog.  Apparently it was worth the price.   The big hiccup was the service.  Our waitress was unfriendly and inattentive.  The place was not busy (it was a Tuesday), so I couldn't understand why it took so long to have plates cleared and drinks refilled.  That said, the food more than makes up for it."}
{"text":"My review in one word - disappointing. How about two words? Very disappointing. We were so excited to try this place after strong yelp reviews and friends' recommendations so we saved our first visit for my birthday. 6:15 Saturday night reservations started off great. Seated right away, asked if we had theater plans so they could make sure they tended us in a timely manner. Seemed like a great beginning. That was when it went downhill.   The two of us were seated along the wall where the \" tables\" for two are located. These tables are woefully small and completely inadequate for any dinner setting. And they are so close together!! They are essentially thigh width apart!! There should be a minimum state requirement of butt width for goodness sake! Even the skinny busboys couldn't wedge themselves in there. When your chair is wider than the table, you know it's bad. Makes for a very disruptive dining experience when your neighbor leaves. Plus, I think the fire marshall should have a look at this. Can't be safe. When I say close together, I mean the plates of the diners on either side of me were just as close to me as my wife's across the table! Everything was in arms reach. I wanted a table for two, not a party of six. I am not that interested in your life, trust me.   Beer served in cans is not my style but I did one anyway. Arrived warm. Wanted to try the smoked wings we'd heard about so we started with those and the curry mussels. Both came out together and we literally had to stack them on top of each other on the table since it was so tiny. Ridiculous. The wings were the best thing all night - good, not great. I'm a huge mussels fan and was excited when they arrived looking fresh and delish. They were large but not delish. There was NO flavor. Bland with a capital B. No curry flavor at all - I think the steaming liquid would have tasted better.  Did the spice cabinet turn out to be empty? Nice quantity though. Just not what I would have expected. Frankly I could have stopped eating here - and wish I had.   We had placed our entire order at one time. I ordered the brisket sandwich and my wife the short rib flatbread. Between appetizers and entree was at least 50 minutes. At one point I was finally able to grab our server ( where DOES she does disappear to?) and told her, if it's not out now, just cancel the order. She had stopped by 25 minutes prior and said they'd be out in one minute. Wrong.  Amazingly, mine came out but she dropped the flat bread in the kitchen.  Service disaster. Let's just say 2 1/2 hours is way too long for what we had. One hour waits between courses? Absurd. Service was among the worst I've ever experienced. And the brisket? After 3 bites I put my utensils down. Not good at all. Another flavorless serving. Flatbread? Awful. Short rib my eye. If there was more than an ounce of short rib on there I'll buy your next meal.   I feel bad giving it two stars but that was what my experience calls for. Oh, and the very limited draft beer menu? No Oktoberfest at all. Instead, a summer session ale? I mean, come on guys - this is October! There's no excuse for that. And at $7 and $10 each for our drafts, this is not a place I'd even want to drink."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite place to eat, but the past couple times I've gone it hasn't been that great. I hope they revive themselves."}
{"text":"Met some friends from out of town and we were not disappointed.  Appetizer - Grilled Bread, Fried Pickles, and Wings.  Grilled Bread - served with freshly made preserve and butter - quite yummy to counteract the next appetizer.  Fried Pickles were approximately 1/2 inch thick.    The batter was thicker than I was used to at other establishments.   Very good to eat with my Porkslap Beer!  Wings were smoked (I honestly did not try).   My friends loved them and could not stop eating them before their entree came out.  I tried to the Pork (Fred Flinestone style) with baked beans and bacon served with a side of cole slaw.    The pork chop was approximately 2 inches thick and cooked perfectly.   The entire dish was awesome.  My friends ordered the Lamb Burger which received high marks.     Another ordered the Flank Steak which received a meh... due to seasoning.   Desert was followed by Rasberry - Oranged Cheese Cake and the ever decadent Chocolate Mousse Cake(?) Both were very good and a great contrast.   The only minus was the serving of the cheese cake (which seemed to be served in a shallow Jar.   It made it very hard for sharing.  If you want the experience but not the cost - sit at the bar.  Order a PBR for $3, split a flat bread or some wings (good portion) - You will have a good experience.    The bar is crowded but patience and PBR's go a long way :-)  Atmosphere - Crowded and Trendy.  Food - Very good - Cooked correctly.   I will be trying more of the appetizers and flatbreads in the future  Price - Snacks (Grilled Bread and Fried Picklets) - $5-$8 range, Appetizers - $12-16, Entrees $16-25 (average) besides the meal for two.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go here for a long time and this past Saturday we were finally able to make it. For a place with such a strong reputation, I was hoping for a bit more. If the prices were cheaper and/or the portions were a bit bigger this would be a solid 4, but these issues, followed with not meeting my expectations from the hype of the solid reptutation left me not super impressed.  We started off with the Lobster Mac and Yellowfin Ceviche. Both were good, but a bit pricey. I really did like the ceviche, but it was only maybe 10 small cubes of tuna. Then, most of us got a cobb salad and we all thought it was a nice size portion and pretty tasty. I thought the avocado ranch was a little too subdued in flavor though. Also, it could have used just a bit more bacon for the saltiness and it almost definitely requires an extra side of dressing. Good deal and flavor overall; worth the price for the most part in my opinion, but it would be nice if it was a bit cheaper when combined with an entree.  As for my entree, I ordeded the salmon, which was pretty good, but was a bit too salty I believe from the Korean hot sauce. I needed about 4-5 glasses of water to get through dinner. I thought the portion was a good size and the price wasn't too expensive at $22. I got to try a couple bites of the Pot Roast and the Pork Belly Tacos as well, which were order by others at my table. The Pot Roast was good for pot roast, but not something I would normally ever order at a restaurant. Pot roast, in my opinion, is a meal your mom makes you at home. Then, I tried one of the pork belly tacos. It was interesting for sure. The toppings were very pleasant; however, something about the very fatty pork belly was not my cup of tea. For the money, this dish is a good deal, but I don't think I'd ever order it.  Overall it was a nice restaurant, but it has room for improvement and I was just expecting more after seeing all the great reviews on Yelp. Also, we had reservations, which we had arrived promptly for, but it took another 25 minutes or so to be seated and only after I asked the hostess. She told me that she texted the person who made the reservation a few minutes prior, but failed to turnaround and ask the people in the lobby if we were the party ready to be seated (we were sitting right behind her)... Not that everyone needs to order an appetizer, salad, and an entree, but it added up to about $50 bucks after tip, which is just a bit too rich for me for one person."}
{"text":"Really, REALLY enjoyed my birthday brunch here. Meat & Potatoes didn't look like much was going on from the outside (it was raining) but as soon as we walked in we were pleasantly surprised. Reading about the bloody mary bar on Yelp is what attracted me to this place but the nice atmosphere and DJ really made it fun.   Our waitress was so pleasant and happily gave us recommendations for their house-infused vodkas and brunch entrees. My boyfriend and I both ordered the black pepper and garlic vodka for our bloody mary's and really enjoyed making our own versions at the bar. I honestly can't say what the vodka tasted like because I put so many other things in mine but I can say their bloody mary mix is amazing.  I had the brisket hash and it came with two eggs. It was so good but it was my birthday so I was more focused on my drink. My man got the fried chicken and he loved it so much that he ate every bite.  I'd love to come back and try dinner here, too. Next time I'm in Pittsburgh, Meat & Potatoes will definitely be first on my list."}
{"text":"Really good food!!!!! but my only critique is that the mushroom risotto should be in a meal size! I'm mostly vegetarian while my boyfriend is a huge meat lover so I found something I love but it's so tiny ): ... but the risotto is phenom, Mac n cheese really good, my family liked the salmon, poutine, burgers and the meat sandwich.  Basically everything is amazjnf"}
{"text":"My husband and I have had dinner or brunch here about a dozen times in the past.  Each time we have had less than great service but we were always happy with our drinks and food so we let it slide.  However, today we showed up for our brunch reservation and waited ten minutes to be acknowledged by a server and then another twenty minutes with no drinks or explanation for why our drinks (a Bellini and vodka for the Bloody Mary bar) were taking so long. After thirty five minutes of waiting - we made a reservation at a neighboring restaurant and left.  There are too many great restaurants in Pittsburgh now to deal with the less than stellar service you will find at Meat and Potatoes.  Do yourself a favor and skip this one!"}
{"text":"Very unusual menu- make sure to review it before going.   As others have stated, it is rather noisy and tables are right on top of each other.  Also the lighting is very dim, which makes it difficult to see the presentation of meals as they pass by to help you decide what to order.   The only thing I'd recommend, because it looked so good, was the 34 oz. Ribeye for 2 - it truly looked like something out of the Flintstones, and will leave you plenty of leftovers to take home."}
{"text":"I was excited to go to Meat and Potatoes for some meat and potatoes.  Unfortunately, I came on 'fish fry friday'.  The place was packed 5 minutes after it opened so I'm assuming their fish is amazing.  I went with the 'I'm not catholic' burger (real name) and it was outstanding.  I could barely finish half."}
{"text":"Just had their Brunch for the first time today, holy crap.  I went for with no reservation right at 1030 when they opened and was quickly seated at the bar.  If you want a brunch table you really need to call ahead.  We started with the make your own bloody Mary bar which blew my mind.  You get a choice of several different alcohols and a mass of options to throw in them.  The choices literally blew my mind.  The knowledgable bar tender warned me not to overpopulate my bloody Mary and I'm glad I took his advice.  They literally had 20 kinds of hot sauce to finish your drink with.  We started with the seared pork belly topped with an egg and kimchi.  It was phenomenal I'd go back just for this. The appetizer was last meal good.  I had the short rib hash and my guest had the Irish breakfast(forget the real name). Both were awesome.  The service was good and the place was bustling. The only downside is that it's really small, this wasn't a problem today but I can see how it would be.  Will definitely return"}
{"text":"It doesn't get any better than this. Unless you could get a table without a reservation!  My favorite cocktail is the Moscow mule.  I can't start a meal there without one.  Then there are the chicken livers. That amazing crunch followed by the velvety middle!  Pulled pork chorizo Mac and cheese is comfort food at its best. Three little pigs sandwich is this foodie's guilty pleasure.  No one could finish this in one sitting. The muscles of the day are always an adventure.  House made corned beef...Bravo!"}
{"text":"Amazing!  Brunch, lunch, dinner, and cocktails.  Meat & Potatoes never fails you.  Short rib hash, Chicken and waffles, and the Bronzino are particularly amazing"}
{"text":"Never disappointed with the food.  However, the table \"setting\" system needs a fix.  My party was one of the first reservations for the day and despite having made the reservation a month prior, we were taken to a table next to the kitchen.  This move would have been acceptable except none of the other tables for four were even taken.  What happened to \"first come, first served\"?  Our request to be moved was granted, but interestingly enough, that 'kitchen' table was never occupied until two hours later.  Guess everyone else didn't want to sit in the clanky corner either when other tables were available."}
{"text":"So two years later, I'm back at Meat & Potatoes for brunch on a beautiful sunny Fall Sunday. My friend and I felt lucky to have been able to make a reservation at 12:00pm on a Sunday with such short notice. Somehow -- they had a table for two available in the next 15 minutes! Sweet!   The best part? When we sat down. Such comfortable seat cushions. We were seated next to the DJ, which for some people would have been less than ideal, but we enjoyed the music and were still able to have a fine conversation without yelling, so I think the volume levels are set just right.  The menu features Eggs Benedict, shrimp & grits ettouffee, chicken and waffles and a few other things. Those who don't prefer eggs for brunch may feel limited in scope for choices (as my friend), but mostly everything on the menu is incredibly delicious (I say with confidence), so how can you go wrong?  I ordered the Thanksgiving Benedict, despite already harfing down 3 soft boiled eggs for breakfast earlier that day. I could eat 12 eggs a day. This was eggactly the eggsperience I was looking for (shoot me now please), but in all honesty: the Benedict was INCREDIBLE. Stuffing - delicous cuts of turkey and perfectly poached eggs with house made cranberry sauce. It came together divinely and was the ultimate comfort food. I tried my friend's shrimp etouffee as well and it creamy, tangy and delightful.  For dessert, we shared something only God could whip up in heaven. The problem being is that I was so damn engrossed with eating it, that I sort of forgot what it called on the menu (dessert menu changes practically daily). All I can say is: if there's a mix of ice cream + a brownie with nuts type of biscotti -- go for it! Or really trust your servers recommendations (like we did). So. Divine.  The price was super reasonable as well. Definitely recommend M&P for brunch -- don't know about dinner/lunch, but I would imagine they can do no wrong!"}
{"text":"Reminiscent of other bars I have seen. We were definitely overquoted for a table but sitting at the bar was nice. Bartenders were friendly and informative, and service was pretty quick. Obviously not the best place to go if you are vegan/vegetarian. But definitely a good starter spot for some cocktails and snacks."}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I were visiting Pittsburgh for the first time and were looking for a brunch spot on Saturday around 1. Thanks to the awesome Yelp community, I came across Meat & Potatoes & quickly landed on having brunch here. My boyfriend had the brisket & I had the omelette of the day; both were delicious! So glad we stumbled upon this super cute place (service was fast too--maybe it was the time of day?!)."}
{"text":"The food was tasty.  The lighting was a bit dark for my taste, but the food made up for it.  We ordered the \"meat and potatoes\" dish for 2...and it should have come with a disclaimer.  A Flintstones sized steak came out that covered most of the table, accompanied by like 4 steak fries.  Next time I'll go with 4 people, order one of these and a few sides.   Yum,"}
{"text":"I have to thank my son and his wife for turning me onto this gem of a restaurant. They have great service and great food. It's best to call and make a reservation in advance, especially on Fridays and weekends..I love their Muscles with curry sauce . The steaks are excellent and I haven't had anything there I didn't like. The menu is sophisticated but not overwhelming. The staff has always been accommodating and willing to help with selections or nutritional preferences. If you have a date this is the place to go for dinner then a movie. I think you'll like the Outcome. If not, he or she was not for you."}
{"text":"Had a reservation, which is a must. The place was packed and everything is cramped, which is the biggest down side to the restaurant. Cocktails were pricey, but delicious. Food was awesome, everything was delicious."}
{"text":"This one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. The menu features a variety of interesting options and changes on a regular basis. Their brunch is also one of the best in town. The chicken and waffles is amazing and the breakfast cocktails are unique and different."}
{"text":"Such a big fan of Meat & Potatoes. Definitely get reservations or arrive early to reserve a spot at the bar. The food is wonderful. Service isn't the best, but the food is so great. I really need to try their brunch sometime..."}
{"text":"Lots of locally sourced food in a busy setting. The tables are close together. Service was very good and the cocktails are not to be missed. The pouting was adequate and the pork belly tacos are delightful. Reminded us of Founding Farmers in DC and is about half the price. Great find in Pittsburg."}
{"text":"The wait was definitely worth it.  We've been meaning to come here for the longest time. You either need to walk-in and hope you can find an open table or make a reservation weeks and sometimes even months in advance. While I hate planning my dinner plans that long ahead - I craved and made my RSVP 3 weeks in advance for a date night thru Yelp.  They have an option of indoor and outdoor seating. But since it was somewhat of gloomy evening - we chose to sit inside. The seating area especially those for 2 are very close to each other but not too close to bother us. The place is dimly lit and it can be at times be pretty noisy. They have the regular menu and a special of the day menu that includes few starters, drinks, main course and desert that are specially priced for the day.  We started with a dark and stormy for the lady and a draft beer that was on special. For the starters, we went with their famous Bone Marrow and Fried Pig Ears. Since my lady doesn't eat Beef - I devoured the Bone Marrow on my own including some Fried Pig Ears. I must say, I was a bit disappointed with the Bone Marrow. Although delicious - it just wasn't as good as I had hoped for or perhaps my expectation was just too high. I would probably skip the Bone Marrow next time. The Fried Pig Ears dipped in sweet chili sauce was really good though.  For our main course, I went with the Hudson Valley Duck Breast and she got the Salmon. The medium rare duck breast was juicy and delicious and had a certain sweet flavor to it. Not something I would recommend pairing with the Bone Marrow. The salmon was however a different story. They are absolutely delicious and the combination with black rice, kimchi, korean hot sauce and fried egg was just perfect. I can't recommend the salmon high enough.  The service was just as good.  We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"The dinner menu is limited and, in my opinion, somewhat overpriced. Well known for its fancy cocktails. The name seems a misnomer because the dishes are prepared with some \"creativity\" which generally work but seem an end unto themselves by being different than standard."}
{"text":"First impression at the front door are the hostesses. Regretfully for this restaurant they must not have ever learned that first impressions are everything and these people at the front door are obnoxiously rude. Despite my better judgement I have eaten here three times despite this fact. Each time was about an average to below average experience. The food is good for the most part with exception to the poutine. It was very disappointing. They basically brought us french fries with cheese on top which is not poutine. The service is normally slow. One of our visits was on my birthday and the waiter spilled drinks all over myself and my wife. The manager did comp us a round of drinks, but in my opinion he should have comped us anything except the cheapest part of our bill. Unfortunately for this place they will be missing out on my business. Good food, bad service and not worth the wait. C-."}
{"text":"Was sitting there for more than 20 minutes while we had our reservation a week ealier. After seated was told the big ribeye was sold out?primary reason we came here?. Service was OK, food was delicious but not as good as expected"}
{"text":"Meat & Potatoes is practically legendary in Pittsburgh.  This restaurant is within the Cultural Trust building that contains a parking garage, the backstage bar, and the Cabaret Theater.  It is usually crowded so definitely make a reservation if possible.  My friend and I came here as a celebration, and we ordered quite a bit of food.  We started with the Tartare ($16) and Short Rib Flatbread ($12).  We needed some instructions with the Tartare because we had no idea how to eat it.  We ended up ordering pita to it with it, but the server could have done a bit more explaining when asked.  The flatbread, however, was unique and delicious.  It had the rib meat, bleu cheese, and a sweetness to it.  For dinner, I ordered the Parpadelle ($18), which was FANTASTIC.  I eat very little meat in general, but the meat here is flawless.  It is so perfectly tender and amazing.  The pasta and sauce were delicious as well.  Absolutely recommend.  My friend ordered the duck breast ($18), which was also delicious!  I know most people come here and get the giant cow thing, but I am not into meat enough to order that.   We finished off our meal with some kind of Creme Brule dessert thing.  It was served in a mason jar and also had hints of chocolate.  It was just ok and really lacked any distinct flavor.  We did not even eat half of the dessert between two of us.  So why is this place not perfect?  The lovely ambiance is ruined by tables that are too close together.  You can barely move and forget having much of a conversation with anyone you are out to dinner with.  The worst part is that you are so close that the people next to you will try to jump into your conversation.  It's basically family style seating, which is so not my scene.  While the food is fantastic, I am unlikely to return unless I want to sit alone at the bar."}
{"text":"They seemed to have increased the brunch prices across the board (at least the last time I was there). One of the best things about this place was its affordability, and it's just a bit more expensive now. Still a solid menu, and still a relatively inexpensive brunch option in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"We visited Meat and Potatoes while in Pittsburg, this place was awesome!!! Drinks were great, service was awesome and food was delish!   This restaurant has a really cool vibe, it is casual dress but still feels fancy. My husband always eats here when is is town for business and I was thrilled he brought me!   This is a must try when in the burg!"}
{"text":"The 45 oz ribeye is about 20 oz of fat. Pretty much a disaster. The atmosphere is great, but the staff are about as aloof and condescending as anywhere in Pittsburgh. This is the prototypical place where they want you to thank them for allowing you to eat there. Great atmosphere, ok food, horrible people."}
{"text":"The food is so good here! The duck and salmon was delicious. The service was outstanding! Very friendly and helpful! I'd definitely come back! A great experience! The corpse reviver #2 was the drink for us but we went ahead and tried 3 different ones all pretty good!"}
{"text":"Downtown Pittsburgh here I come to get me a little bit of meat potatoes! Great location awesome atmosphere, nice vibe, great Decour, great service and amazing food! Some very trippy presentations that are very pleasing to the eye when you see them at the table you just have to try them!"}
{"text":"Our food was quite good, but the ambiance left a bit to be desired. The restaurant seemed like it couldn't decide what it was trying to be. The music was too loud, and the bar scene too overpowering for a cozy meal with friends."}
{"text":"Got the pleasure of going to Meat and Potatoes for brunch last Saturday.  You definitely want to make a reservation.  We got one at 1030 when they open, and by the time we left the place was packed!  We all had the bloody Mary bar, which was fabulous!  You can pick from an assortment of tequila, vodka or gins that are all house made with chills, bacon and all sorts of flavors.  Then they have a counter full of everything you could want to make a delicious bloody Mary.  Everyone ordered something different.  I had the Huevos Rancheros.  It was excellent!  I ate the whole thing!  Yummy tortilla layers with beans, salsa, eggs, and cheese!  Others at the table got breakfast sandwiches, that looks amazing and if you are really hungry, the chicken and waffles which was enough for 4 people!  We also got some fries to share that come with a yummy truffle mayo!  I highly recommend the Brunch!"}
{"text":"Went there with a friend on my visit to Pittsburgh. Put it on my list of places to try after seeing it on Travel Channel. All I have to say is wow. Great food great place. Bone marrow is a must try."}
{"text":"Great service and food. It's like a speakeasy but not all douched up. The drinks are amazing and the bone marrow is delicious."}
{"text":"We did brunch here. It fills up quickly, so either get to the bar right when they open or have a reservation very far ahead of time. We got the Brisket Hash and Stuffed French Toast. Both were phenomenal and very (almost too!) generous portion sizes. Great flavors with unique twists on breakfast classics. Food came out quickly. Service was very pleasant. They also have a Bloody Mary bar that we can't wait to try next time."}
{"text":"Had heard rave reviews about Meat &  Potatoes, so decided to give it a try.  We went in on a Tuesday night without reservations.  While there seemed to be a few open tables, we were told it was an hour + wait if we didn't have reservations, but fortunately there were three open spots at the bar (went with two colleagues).  Food wise (both selection and quality) I'd say it was very good, worth visiting.  Service on the other hand was slow.  It took awhile for the bartender to take our order, and it was a bad sign when he returned to ask us for it again (and still didn't get it right...but to his credit, they comped the dish that he forgot and brought out late).    Some of the dishes...  -The Mac & Cheese with Chorizon and Pulled Pork was good (though I think Butcher and the Rye does it much better) -The Mushroom Risotto was also tasty.  As a side note, either of these \"small plates\" is a meal by itself -The fried brussel sprouts were amazing...a MUST! -The \"fried tater tots\" are french fries.  And a VERY generous portion.  We were expecting tater tots, so just want to make sure I mention it's really fries...and again, A LOT of fries -One colleague ordered a barbecue porkchop, which was bigger than him.  But he said it was good (though hard to finish after sharing the brussel sprouts and fries) -My other colleague ordered a caesar salad, which looked very unique...it had a fried egg, calamari and I think pork belly  Overall, good, will likely be back (though would give Butcher and the Rye the edge after a first visit to each)"}
{"text":"I thought this was a fine place--the room is lovely, the food is well presented, there is a lot of energy while still not so noisy you can't have a good conversation, solid professional service.  One of my girls picked out Meat and Potatoes when I was visiting, and this was a great choice.  Six of us had a great table, round and good for conversation, in a corner of the room with a nice view of the restaurant; the bar looked like a nice place to sit for a casual meal.  The duck breast was outstanding and looked nice on the plate, others had the chicken and the meatloaf and a couple other things and everyone was very happy.  (One odd note that has now recurred in Pittsburgh; it seems like every time we ask a waiter 'we have a vegetarian dining tonight, any suggestions for how to work around the menu?', the first thing our waitress asked back is, 'so do you eat fish?'  This is the second time this happened!  I mean, it's no big deal, but still odd.  I'd understand eggs or cheese, people want to clarify between vegetarian and vegan and that's not clear, but a fish is not a vegetable!)."}
{"text":"Great place with great food. This was my first time here even though I knew about this place for a while now. I will definitely go back agin soon. The food was very good and every employee we spiked too seemed very nice."}
{"text":"Generally, I would write a lengthy post, but not today. The bottom line is that our food was DELICIOUS..... And worth every penny spent. The service was great, the atmosphere was charming, and I am so glad that we made a reservation here!"}
{"text":"The good was AMAZING! I ordered the pappardelle and fell in love. We also ordered the brussels sprouts and kobe corn dog to start. Our order of sprouts were a little too salty and the waiter quickly replaced with a fresh batch that were much better. Both were really good. This was our first visit. Our only complaint is that we were seated so close to other patrons that you can't have a private conversation. I felt like we were dining with four other people. Also it is really, really noisy. Not a place for a quite romantic dinner. But the food is great. Would dine here again."}
{"text":"Boil em, Mash em, Stick em in a stew. Boil em, Mash em, Stick em in a stew. Potatoes. Potatoes. Potatoes.  So I got the fried chicken a waffles. They basically give you one of those KFC buckets and pour it on you waffles. So much fried chicken. They must have a bunch of chickens back there.  My sister got the Ranchos and it was so tasty and refreshing with spice.  Come get some POTATOES. I forgot to this time but that is what I will be getting next time."}
{"text":"Meat and Potatoes was my initiation into Pittsburgh cuisine and literally the first dinner meal I grabbed a few months back. The joint has a gastropub atmosphere with a bar in the center of the room and tables surrounding it. The servers/bartenders are all extremely friendly and have always been very cordial. The cocktails are delicious and well made. The décor is hip and classy which I never thought I would say about a joint. It was a Monday and I pulled up a seat at the bar and was immediately presented with menus for my perusal. I can say that ive been here a few times now since my travel started to Pittsburgh and the combined food that I have ordered has been the Mac and Cheese, parpadelle, fried taters, wagyu strip steak, etc.   The mac and cheese is really rich and even the appetizer portion is enough for a meal. If you love gooey cheese with special ingredients like brisket or lobster or foie gras, then this is your dish. There is nothing to hate about it. The parpadelle is another mouth pleaser and out of this world. The meat is perfectly tender and amazing with the sauce and pasta being the perfect compliment. I am personally a bigger fan of the dirty pasta over at butcher and the rye but this dish is a close second. The fried taters is a fancy way of saying French fries and boy do they deliver on it. This dish is a solid sharing plate for a few folks. The wagyu is the only one that I was not 100% a fan of. To me, it seemed like trying to put a fancy \"Asian\" spin and the sauce was a bit too heavy and overpowered the juiciness of the steak making it seem like it was in the passenger seat. Still solid dish but a slight disappointment amidst the other dishes that I am a big fan of.   All in all, a great joint and a spot that I visit frequently. Love the service, the food, and the vibe. Definitely recommending to any folks trying to find a solid spot."}
{"text":"I called to make a reservation to bring clients out to dinner, when I called back 30 minutes later to change the head count from 4 to 5 I was told that they could not accommodate my request because the table they had reserved for us can only seat 4 and that their is nothing they could do.  I asked if they could move my table he said no. POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE, ill spend money on my clients else where!"}
{"text":"I used to not be a fan but I have to say, after my last few visits,  I am indeed more of a fan and I really do like Meat & Potatoes.    Service is great, the menu is interesting and everything that I have had lately, be it for lunch or dinner has been great.  For lunch I love the Thai Steak Salad.  It is filling and yummy - a healthier option for there I would have to say.  I like the hanger steak, mussels, Salty Pig Flatbread, Brussel sprouts, mushroom risotto, etc...   I think their mussels are some of the best in town- an absolute must have.  And my hubby raves about the lunch burger (I cannot vouch for this though).  The Brussels are banging - you have to get those.   Even on off nights- they seem to have a vibrant bar scene."}
{"text":"A carnivores dream come true!  24 hours later I still dream of their Pastrami rubbed pork belly.  It typically comes topped on their pub burger, but a polite request for a side of the delicacy brought so much damn pig that I struggled to finish.  Sat at the bar and the service was outstanding... Friendly, attentive, and accommodating.  Witnessed one of the gentleman whip up a coffee cocktail that to accommodate the couple next to me that was not on the menu.  Brisket Mac and cheese is another ridiculous option.. Delicate smoke, blue cheese creaminess with a BBQ chip crunch.   Prices are totally reasonable for the quality and portions of the food.  Took a 30 minute uber from my hotel to try this place and I plan on doing it again next month when I am back in town."}
{"text":"First time here was on light up night. Got in and found seats at the bar. Staff was extremely helpful, friendly, and very attentive even though the place was packed our entire visit. Had the deep fried pickles which were awesome!!!  Blake the bartender could not have been nicer and made us amazing drinks...coming back and hoping to have dinner next time."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, food is decent. I found the serving sizes varied a lot from dish to dish. Drinks are delicious."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch, and it was super tasty. I became super jealous of my friends' amazing Blood Marys. I don't even like Blood Marys, and I wanted one. I ended up going with the Eggs in Purgatory. The pulled pork ragout was super flavorful. I loved the fresh richness of the tomato sauce. The warm toasted bread that accompanied it was just perfect. My French 75 was very refreshing and really hit the spot. I highly recommend this place for brunch. It's great!"}
{"text":"This place is aaaaamazing.  We didn't have reservations, and on a busy theatre night, we were seated at the bar.  Unknowingly, we chose to check out the place on a night where happy hour involved half priced cocktails (think depression era libations) and $3 tin beer.  It was my first go at a San Franciscan black IPA, which was recommended to us by the bartender.  Beer fans, if you haven't already tried the \"Back in Black,\" run to Meat and Potatoes right now.  We started with the beef tartar and bone marrow, then moved onto the salmon with brussel sprout kimchi and pork chop.  Everything was delicious (especially the brussel sprout kimchi!).  The pork chop was perfectly cooked, topped with bacon, and is still making my mouth water...The menu items are incredibly innovative and prepared perfectly.  I'll definitely be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"I came to Pittsburgh for a business trip and was recommended meats and potato from a local. Oh my gawd, it did not disappoint. The steak for two is huge and leaving the bone on was a great touch! It was cook to perfection! That was my first time eating bone marrow and It was good. The staff was professional, helpful, and always perky. The wine was great. My coworker pick It out and boy it was great! The atmosphere is warm and inviting with alot of meat related decoration. Steak with potato and wine, it just doesn't get better than that. Next time i come back, I will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere of the restaurant and the food was great. A little small and squished for my liking. My fiancé and I went for our anniversary and we were pretty much in the conversation of the couples sitting next to us. One of the couples started getting touchy-feely and the mans shoulders were literally rubbing my fiances haha. It was funny. I would go back again for the food and the bar though."}
{"text":"Very cool place!!  Had the massive Ribeye and it was great!  It's more than enough for two hearty eaters!  Probably my favorite in Pittsburgh.  Different than most places."}
{"text":"Brunch was great!  The flatbread brisket with egg was unique and runny eggs over brisket seasoned well with the crunchy flatbread really worked.   I also has the corned beef eggs Benedict, delicious is the best way to say it. Let's switch to the seating and atmosphere.  Let's say this the chairs grabbed your rear and said hello, sit and stay for a while.  The decor is very new York but in a good way.   4 instead of 5 stars due to the average bloody Mary \"homemade\" mix."}
{"text":"I have to say that since moving from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh, I've been disappointed with the restaurants I've tried so far. Philly made me a total food snob, which happens easily when you can eat any cuisine at any time on any street corner and have a great meal, whether it's $10 or $50. I know, I know there are great places in Pittsburgh and everyone tells me I just haven't been to the \"right\" places yet.  Meat & Potatoes was one of those places! My faith in Pittsburgh food is restored. This was easily the best meal I've had here and definitely up there for one of the best meals I've had anywhere. From my phone call making reservations to dessert, we had an amazing experience here.  I called to make reservations and was connected with Matthew, who was extremely helpful and very pleasant! I had to call back soon after to make changes due to a change in our party number and he was overall very accommodating.    We arrived a bit before our reservation and got drinks at the bar. They have a nice selection of beers, some drafts and then an extensive bottle selection. It was quite crowded, so we took our drinks out to the lobby where there are large, comfy couches and tables to wait for our table.   When we were seated, we were introduced to Josh, who was a magnificent server and made our meal very enjoyable! He took great care of us throughout the night, from making sure we had everything we needed to making menu suggestions at our request.  Everything was delicious. We started with the Curry Mussels and Wild Mushroom Risotto. They were a great indication of the quality of the food we were going to have and we could not stop raving about it. The risotto was creamy and cooked perfectly. I am a huge fan of Mussels and loved something other than the traditional red or white sauce. Curry, coconut milk, lemongrass...YUM!  Each of us ordered a different entree and shared so we could sample everything. I could not have been happier with my selection. I ordered the Agnolotti pasta. It had pecorino romano cheese, greens, sweet potatoes and a maple bourbon foam. I was intrigued right away. A sweet, savory pasta dish that was definitely one of the most delicious and unique I had ever tasted. I am to stop myself from devouring it just so I could savor the leftovers!  The other dishes were equally as delicious! (Some of the best steak I've ever had.) Pappardelle pasta with bolognese sauce, short rib, pancetta and pork shoulder Wagyu Flat Iron with heirloom cherry tomatoes, pickled jicama, wasabi mashed potatoes Hanger Steak with pulled potatoes, romesco,  water cress, green onions, jalapeno vinaigrette  Oh and it didn't stop there. We decided to indulge in dessert because we knew it would be amazing. We shared an Eggnog pot de creme and a chocolate mousse that were both out of this world!!  I will definitely be going back because there were other menu items such as the Korean Reuban and  Lamb Burger that definitely caught my eye as well!"}
{"text":"Sunday brunch!!! We've gone here on 4 different occasions for Sunday brunch and each time we have been blown away!! They have a HUGE Bloody Mary bar and helpful bar tenders, actually all the staff is friendly :) the food is off the charts good and the wait has never been long. A must go for a Sunday funday!"}
{"text":"I have only been here for brunch, for which there are a couple vegetarian options. Glancing at their dinner menu, I feel like I could probably come, if I were in the mood for some serious carbs (the vegetarian options are a little limited).   Anyway, the Bruschetta is amazing - that chimichurri is magical. I really, really enjoy it. I also very much love the bloody mary bar, a $7 build-your-own sort of deal. They have 6ish flavored vodkas in rotation (my favorite is old bay), and then you go get your mix and all the toppings you want. And these are serious toppings: ~20 kinds of olives, 10 kinds of pickles, antipasti of all kinds, stuffed grape leaves, etc.  Sort of an appetizer in its own right.  The portion size for food varies widely - the Bruschetta is just the perfect amount, whereas the chicken and waffles looks like it could feed 4 people. You may want to ask before ordering or look around you.  I often see people waiting to be let in, sometimes angrily. However, they take reservations! You don't even have to call that far in advance if there's only a few of you. Just a tip, so that you're not left out among the hangry people."}
{"text":"Rich, heart warming bone marrow appetizer #yum #sorryarteries #willjogmoremilesnextweek"}
{"text":"Swung by here for brunch on a Sunday morning.  Given my last minute plan, I didn't have a reservation so we had to sit at the bar.  While the bartender was friendly, he didn't know the menu very well and kept having to get back to us regarding our questions on the specials and menus (ie, was there meat in the heuvos rancheros, did the omelet come with any sides, etc).   Also, the service at the bar was very slow because they were too busy making drinks to be attentive to those individuals eating at the bar.   Having said that, my breakfast was pretty delicious.  I ordered the omelet special which was filled with cheese, sausage and peppers.  They were able to substitute soy sausage in it for me and it was oh-so flavorful.  I know soy sausage sounds a little gross but I highly recommend it.  I also came directly after a 14-mile run and was freezing.  I was craving a steaming cup of hot chocolate and much to my chagrin, they don't serve hot chocolate!  Between the lack of hot chocolate and the slow service, I was a little disappointed with my first time here.  Having said that, I'm going to give it a try for dinner and hopefully sample the pumpkin ravioli and some tasty drinks."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. I was a little wary of the fried Brussels sprouts when they were recommended by the bartender, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I ordered the Hudson Valley duck breast which was very good. The plate comes with a small salad, the main entree, and pierogies. Each of the items on the plate was excellent. The texture and presentation were fantastic.  Overall, I was very impressed. They also had good happy hour beer specials with most beers being $3. I will definitely be going back at some point."}
{"text":"This is probably the best place in downtown pittsburgh. Go here for awesome drinks and good food. Not your standard fare"}
{"text":"Food is very good, service is professional, but a specific call out for the Flintstones-sized beef marrow bones. May be the best value/tastiest appetizer in the CBD. Probably should order it to share though as I found out if one person eats the whole thing, there's not much room left for the delicious entree yet to come."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Meat and Potatoes for date night. As other reviewers have noted, it can be quite noisy inside, and the tables (especially the 2-tops) are pretty close together, although not as close as I had feared.  Food and drink: We started with cocktails, which is unusual for us (we usually go straight to wine), but there are some very interesting options on the menu and we weren't disappointed. I had the Mexican Honey Bee- initially the smoky flavor is almost overwhelming, but then it settles and I really enjoyed it, a nice sipping cocktail. My hubs had the Root to Berry, which was also delicious. The hibiscus syrup gives it an interesting note. Hubs said it reminded him of a fruity beach drink, but it was definitely more refined and refreshing. We shared the bone marrow appetizer; the marrow on its own doesn't have a lot of flavor, but it has a silky texture and when smeared on bread and topped with the accompaniments, it was delicious. We both had the Wagyu flatiron, medium rare. Hubs liked it more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it was fine, but I was expecting more. The steak didn't seem to have much of any seasoning (salt or pepper) on it. We did enjoy the bit of heat from the jalapenos, and the celery root puree was yummy. We both had some underdone potatoes, which is too bad because the ones that were fully cooked were tasty. We chose the red wine special for the night, an Excelsior Cab, which was a nice, easy drinking wine. My absolute favorite part of the meal was the dessert- chocolate pot du creme. We each had one, and I am glad we ordered our own because I would not have shared. It was fantastic. As in if you were home, you'd lick the bowl to get every last bit. We ended the evening by enjoying another cocktail at the bar before heading home.   Service: No complaints at all. Riley was our server and he showed up at just the right times. The busboys were friendly and on their game, once we had both finished with our plates for the course they'd be there within a minute to clear. Allison was our bartender and she was great, I was impressed by how she moved so fast and was still able to converse with patrons. Those bartenders earn their money.  Price: Nothing we wouldn't expect. They appear to use high-quality ingredients and it shows. Although I saw a few small children, I wouldn't really recommend it for kids given the food, ambience, and price point.   We'd definitely go back. We agreed we'd like to go back without a reservation, sit at the bar, and order drinks while working our way through a few of the appetizers. Allison suggested checking for a night when there aren't any major theater shows, as it's a bit less busy then. We'll take that advice for sure."}
{"text":"Best Bloody Mary bar I've ever experienced!! So many options on top of the variety of house infused vodkas. Tots/French fries were very good along with the dipping sauce included."}
{"text":"Food was awesome. The place was fancy. Also cute postcard gift at the end :3"}
{"text":"As soon as I knew I was traveling to Pittsburgh for work, I searched on my Yelp app restaurants and things to do near my hotel.  One of the places I bookmarked was Meat & Potatoes.  Talking to one of my Yelp friends, the night before I left on my trip, he recommended this same place so, now, of course, I must go.  I arrived in Pittsburgh on a Wednesday.  That night, I went straight to this restaurant.  I could see it was busy but, I only needed a table for one so I thought I would be able to get in.  Nope, it was 100% full and wait time was about 1.5 hours.  Good sign...  week day and this busy, must be really good.  So, again, using my Yelp app I made a reservation for Lunch the next day (should have done this from the very beginning...)    They opened at 11:30am, and my reservation was at 12:15pm.  I arrived right on time and was happy to see it wasn't crowded this time so, plenty of seats to choose from.  I sat right in front of the bar, where I could see the mixologist working her magic.  My server was great, friendly, always with a smile, and gave excellent recommendations.  I was between a pasta dish and the mussels.  Since it was lunch time, she said the pasta would be too heavy and I would definitely have leftovers (not practical when staying at a hotel) so I went with the mussels which I love, and can say they have one of the best dishes I've ever had.  It's an almost endless mountain of mussels in a coconut milk, lemongrass, curry broth, with cilantro and chili.  The chili is spread out through the mussels so you get the heat from it on some and it's absolutely delicious.  On top of that it comes with half a loaf of perfectly made garlic bread.  I'm not a fan of garlic but this, I could not resist, it is divine by itself and even better when dunked in the broth.  This dish is truly outstanding...  you can see for yourself, check out the picture I took and tell me your mouth is not watering immediately...  Other thing I love is trying signature drinks, especially when you see a bar like the one at Meat & Potatoes.  Equipped with every tool necessary for a mixologist (not a bartender), glasses of every type, herbs, bitters, fruits, you name it, they have it.  After looking through the \"Libations\" menu I went with the Vieux Carre - hennesy cognac / bulleit rye / cocchi vermouth di torino / benedictine / angosutra & peychaud.  My server described this as an \"in between a Manhattan and an Old Fashioned\".  They add one of those big blocks of ice to keep the drink cold and not watered down, and a lemon rind.  It's elegant, strong, but smooth and with a touch of sweetness, excellent for sipping and enjoy the beautiful bar.  They also have outside seating, which I'm sure would be very enjoyable on a beautiful day or night but, personally, after seeing the décor and bar inside, if I ever have the chance to go back, that's where I would like to be.  Where I can see those wonderful drinks be created and the amazing food is just steps away.  Regardless of what time you go, where you sit, or what you order, I assure you, one visit is all it takes to become a fan of this place.  To those living in the area...  lucky you!"}

I just want to live in eternity ere, eating bone marrow.\"  This is one of the most wonderful restaurants in the whole western side of the state.  It's pricey, but for what you get, it's a steal.  Go here,  take your friends, take your family, take your girlfriend.  Bring your appetite!"}
{"text":"The mussels with frites are AMAZING. Flatbreads are pretty good. Chairs are super comfy, thank goodness because service is pretty slow."}
{"text":"Had lunch while in town for business and loved it! The fried pickles and thai beef salad were great. Service was top notch as well! I did not get to try the cocktails, but the list looked well done! I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Nice place for drinks.  However, I was not impressed with the food.  Had chicken and found it to be a low quality meal."}
{"text":"I ate at this restaurant once for lunch and once for dinner. I greatly enjoyed my food both times. The lunch menu currently consists of appetizers, salads, sandwiches, and entrees such as chicken, pork, and rigatoni. The dinner menu has some more options such as burgers, flat breads, duck, steak, and salmon. The restaurant is not a large space and does get packed with people, so I sat cozily next to strangers during lunch, but I had a little more space when I was seated in the second dining room for dinner. Service from the waiter for lunch was very good. Service for dinner was very slow. I had to wait over an hour for my entree to come out. Price was moderate for lunch. For dinner we spent $120 for two people without drinks. I would recommend the delicious Wagyu Flat Iron that I ate for dinner, although the carrots that accompanied it were overly burned. Dressing casually is OK."}
{"text":"I am a vegetarian and was hesitant to come to a place called meat and potatoes, but my colleagues really wanted to try it. I was really impressed! I got a glass of prosecco and it was reasonably priced! I ordered the mushroom flatbread and it was delicious. The waitress told me the risotto was too small for a meal. The flatbread is plenty for dinner for one person."}
{"text":"Excellent.  Reasonably priced for the quality of the food.  Took a little longer to get our food, but worth it.  Outdoor seating was great."}
{"text":"This place a must go to place for great drinks, great food, and a nice gastropub feel. A friend introduced us to this place and he was good friends with the owner/chef and we were able to try so many delicious dishes on their menu. The staff were amazing and super friendly (on other occasions that we've been here without our friend).   We went here for many different occasions - birthdays, new years eve, just random dinner and brunch events.   Reservations are a MUST - this place is getting hot off the charts. You can reserve the front room and a nice back room for FREE and they are great with accommodating your needs. Special events - they have specials all the time - try them - you won't be disappointed.   Their food is amazing. I love almost everything on their menu - the pub burger, the bacon wrapped dates, fries, porkchops, flat bread.. brunch is great too - chick and waffles - oh the list goes on! Food taste is rich so if you want it a little lighter - just ask! They catered to my mom (who's vegan) and quality was not anything below 5 stars! Their portions are BIG too.  Four stars - would be the servers. I love the chef, the owner (one and the same), the manager who walks around and the bartenders. The waitresses need to work on their skills a little more. Sometimes they forget you and don't pay attention to your needs.  Overall - try this place and make it your next spot!"}
{"text":"Everything here is magically delicious, you really can't go wrong... Plus its super trendy inside, and I dig that."}
{"text":"This is one that Yelp gets right, with a 4 star rating.  It's a pretty basic name for a place that serves above average food; bar service is a bit of a \"show\" and the place is packed as well.  Staff was very friendly, pasta and steak were pretty good and the value - you can't argue with.  I must say, they have very straightforward, yet meaty and well prepared wings.  Beer selection was a bit limited and, of course, focused on the microbrews... much like the rest of Pittsburgh apparently (and the rest of the country right now).  Overall a pleasant, moderately priced experience.  I can see why it's so popular."}
{"text":"Walking into this place I thought here we go again another run of the mill funky \"gastro Pub\" that has a couple beers and is trying to have some cool food for the hipster crowd. Well let me say I was wrong!! I went on friday during lent so they only have fish but they have it in some ways I have never seen. I stayed on the safe side and just got the fish and chip. Having never been here I thought I better stick to the standard fare.Best fish I had in a while and I have been to most of the pittsburgh places that claim to have \"the best fish sandwhich in town\". Will definetly go again!!"}
{"text":"Everyone speaks so highly of this place and I was so eager to go. But I must say that I left somewhat disappointed. I just went with my husband and they put us on the wall in between other couples. I felt like I could brush legs with the people on either side of me and definitely knew everything that the other couples were talking about. We did go on a Sunday and I understand that he restaurant is located near theaters but I definitely felt rushed. I think that we were in and out of there in about an hour with 2 appetizers, two entrees, drinks and dessert. Personally, if I am going to spend money like we did that night, I would prefer to have a nice leisurely dinner.   We ordered the fried Brussels which were good but you also need to expect a somewhat burnt flabor. We had the ahi taquitos which were quite small but not bad. For dinner I had the pork belly tacos. Some were much more fatty than others but still decent and my husband had some sort of steak option. He was extremely happy with his meal while I still think that I have had better.   I would recommend this to someone who is going to a play but even then, we had reservations and sat outside in the waiting area for over half an hour to not be comped anything. Even if we didn't get anything comped, you would think that they would have at least acknowledged how long the wait was."}
{"text":"There was no other place I could have imagined having my last meal of 2015 at other than Meat and Potatoes. The first course was the Smoked Brisket Mac and Cheese, the brisket was incredible moist and tender, pairing excellently with the creamer variation on this mac and cheese dish.   From there I went with the Leg of Lamb Steak. The cook on the steak was great. There was hardly trace of fat. I must say tho the star of the dish I would have to give the butternut squash caponata and bulgar wheat. The sweet taste of the squash with the hardiness of the wheat. There was just something about the pairing,  a bowl of it and I would have been quite content.   Which leaves me with dessert. I went with the oreo cream brownie. To be honest I only went with it because it was done differently than the usual mason jar filled dessert that there known for. That being said although any dessert I've had there has been great. I think they have come to shine when they step out of there normalcy and deconstruct something that makes me want to tell my friends and family about.   All photos of this and other meals are on instagram Hybrid.vigor83"}
{"text":"Didn't understand why I needed to book my reservations so far in advance until we arrived. The restaurant itself is pretty small. Not too many tables to dine at because they  have a fairly large bar in the middle of the restaurant (which is totally fine by me too, who doesn't like large bars).   Ordered some drinks and the cheese board to start. A few good cheeses and the drinks were good as well. I ordered the pork belly tacos-- they were delicious. My boyfriend and dad both ordered the pork chop entree and raved about the tenderness and taste (oh and it was also massive).  Overall, great experience. I'd highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to brunch a couple Saturday's ago with a couple of good friends from out of town. None of us had been here for brunch or dinner, we had just heard it was a do not miss.   We had been over served the night before :) and were looking for good bloody Mary's from this amazing bloody Mary bar that I had heard so much about. I am normally a vodka girl but after listening to our waiter go on and on about the sriracha honey infused tequila, I decided to go with his recommendation. When the glass arrived with ice and a hefty amount of tequila, he encouraged me to try it by itself before I head to the bar. What a mistake! Sipping straight tequila after a night out is NOT a good idea!! However, once I went to the bar and put their delicious house made tomato mix and about 800 fixings, it was the best bloody Mary I have ever had!! I fully recommend the tequila, just not straight.   I had reviewed the menu a few days before to get an idea of what they had and what I was interested in. I had seen an appetizer that was grilled bread, goat butter, and house made jams. I'm in. We ordered it first thing to share at the table. The goat butter was amazing, similar to goat cheese in tang, and the jam was apple cinnamon, to die for. The grilled bread was off the charts, however we did not order more for $1 due to the fact that I would have eaten it all and had no room for my actual meal.   I ordered the huevos rancheros, my boyfriend ordered the short rib hash, our friends ordered the chicken and waffles, and bruschetta. The huevos rancheros was very fresh and delicious. It had an excellent spice that was just at the border of too hot. (My favorite) The short rib hash was a small portion but very filling. He said that he was glad he ordered it, because it was delicious, but he would definitely order something different next time. My friend loved the bruschetta as it was mostly portabello mushrooms and bread. Yum. The chicken and waffles came with a jalapeno cheddar waffle that was not very spicy (which is what the waiter had told her)  at all and basically an entire fried chicken (that was amazing!). She at one piece of chicken and half the waffle and was full.   I would 100% recommend this to anyone looking for a brunch that is not the same old thing, reservations are a must as well. Our waiter was funny and just attentive enough to not be annoying. The atmosphere was comfortable and warm. We will be back!!! (Maybe for dinner this time.)"}
{"text":"M&P is an extremely popular restaurant on Penn Ave with a small wait with a reservation on a weeknight.  There is a comfortable seating lounge in front of the main dining area with a coat rack.  Their décor is both classy and hip (business casual to dressy attire yet Top 40 music playing).  Tables are placed very close to each other so it's uncomfortably easy to hear your neighbor's conversation.  We shared the Meat & Potatoes for Two ($69), which included their famous bone marrow and steak.  Our waiter informed us that the wait for that entrée averages around 30 minutes but could be up to an hour on a busy night!  We ordered appetizers and drinks while we waited.  My friend loved the fried pickles and fried brussels sprouts but I wasn't a fan of either small plates.  Our M&P for 2 finally arrived (thankfully did not take an hour).  The 34 oz ribeye steak was HUGE and cooked until it was pink to medium, which is how I like my steak.  The bone marrow gratin was very rich, almost like eating liquid butter but with a perfectly spiced crunch.  We were so stuffed that we had to box some of the steak and the potatoes.  It was more than enough food for two people."}
{"text":"Let me begin with the good....customer service dud their best. They were nice. MAKE RESERVATIONS. We waited for a seat at the bar for 36 minutes then waited another 30 mins for our food. I timed an empty table for over 20 minutes before anyone was seated there.  Next, lets talk about this French toast...I couldn't cut through the bread....it was like cutting through a tough steak. I just cut the crust off. The French toast was also a little burnt on the edges....so sad. I was less than impressed.  Im not even going to talk about the chicken and waffles Mr. had....check his review gor yourself."}
{"text":"I don't eat meat, nor do I care much for potatoes, but I love Meat and Potatoes! It's the bar. Central to the bustling restaurant, with a classy marble top, a beautiful absinthe fountain in the corner, Fernet Branca taps, exemplary cocktails...it just feels really good to drink here. I would not want to sit anywhere else, as the table seating is close together and seems to always be packed. M&P is very stylish and \"cool\" making the bar a fantastic post for people watching. Just make sure you don't put off your trips to the bathroom, as there is only one for the whole place - it has both a toilet and a urinal in it, so you can bring your date along with you to the most exclusive intimate seat in the house."}
{"text":"The service, decor, and ambiance were great. The seats are really comfortable! I came for lunch.  The food was also very good, but with some caveats. The taters are actually just French fries, not tater tots if anyone was wondering. They were very good, but the sauce was too rich and garlic-y for my taste.  The sweet potatoes fries and the French fries that are served with the entrees were extremely salty and/or sweet. I would highly recommend replacing them with a salad or something else. My friends and I all agreed the sweet potato fries and French fries were subpar.  The pub burger was excellent, but almost too big to handle. 5 minutes in, my bottom bun of the burger became soggy and wet. The Cuban sandwich was good, but nothing special. The chicken and biscuits were great, and the pork chop was cooked very well with a lot of flavor.  I will definitely try to come back for dinner."}
{"text":"I had the mussels in white wine.  It seemed everyone ordered at least one serving of this, so I needed to find out what was going on. They were fresh, the broth was delicious, I would have preferred more garlic (but I'm a bit obsessed). The staff was so friendly and attentive. We were there before a show and it was packed, things were smooth, they ran on time and were able to provide good customer service.  It was so delicious.  For dessert: tiramisu. YUM! I'll be back... Can't wait."}
{"text":"You MUST love the \"meat\" if you go here. My husband is a carnivore but me--not so much. I had the hot chicken sandwich, yum. I had a Caesar salad and wasn't too impressed. Fried egg on a Caesar? A little too much for me. My husband had pot roast and felt it had good flavor but maybe a little too much parsley. Our food took a bit long, which we were okay with, but the chef insisted on sending out an appetizer. That was very nice. The manager checked on us several times. Atmosphere is very cool. Overall, pretty good place, especially for the meat lovers!"}
{"text":"Having been to Meat & Potatoes at least ten times now, I've had some really amazing meals here, definitely worthy of 5 stars. But I also think things can be a bit inconsistent here. Although it's definitely one of my favorite spots in the 'burgh, it's just short of perfection.  Just like everyone else in the world, I love love love the ambiance here. I find the chairs a little uncomfortable (probably because I'm short and can't reach the table...I should really consider bringing a booster seat) but other than that, everything is gorgeous speakeasy chic and is a good match for the upscale comfort food theme. It also has a great vibe for some classy drinking, and I'd certainly visit the bar more often if I had the $$$  Also, in love with the brunch. I really do think this is the best brunch in the city. The shortrib hash and the korean brisket & eggs are my favorite dishes, and who can resist a $5 DIY bloody mary bar with house-infused vodkas in flavors like bacon and shallot?? I know I can't...though I wish I could so I could try the various flavors of bellini they offer. If you only eat one brunch in Pittsburgh, this is the one you want to try.  The dinner is where I've had some mixed experiences. The steaks and other mains are usually awesome. The mussels have been less impressive, and on the last visit I ordered a version with \"balsamic pearls\" that I expected to mimic the texture of the salmon roe in the dish. Instead there were just clumps of chewy, stale-tasting balsamic vinegar interspersed among the shells. Something is also off in their steak tartare, and trust me...I LOVE tartare. I just think the flavors they choose in trying to be creative don't always work in harmony. But the simple things, the \"meat and potatoes\" if you will, are done wonderfully, and that's what you should come here for."}
{"text":"Everything was great.  The drinks were expertly made.  The wings were some of the best I have had; cooked well, perfectly sauced, tasty and not overly spicy.  The bone marrow was a unique, tasty meat lover's dish.  I really liked the different toppings offered with the marrow.  For dinner, the pub burger and duck were excellent as well."}
{"text":"Our first pleasure of eating at Meat and Potatoes was when it first opened. It is one of our favorite places in the city of Pittsburgh. In fact, its made our Pittsburgh Favorite list. The food is unique and amazing.  We had so much fun with the make-your-own Bloody Mary Bar. This is available during Brunch. You choose your vodka, and add whatever your heart desires. Mine was bacon fused vodka adding in horseradish, roasted red peppers, garlic and garnished with olives. You can check out photos at www.girllikestoeat.com/meat-potatoes/  M&Ps really step up the customer experience.  @GirlLikesToEat, Foodie"}
{"text":"Best brunch in Pittsburgh. My wife and I have been here numerous times and it always is a great meal.   The food is delicious and the Bloody Mary bar is my wife's favorite in the city. We recommend the huevos rancheros and the Bruschetta. We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Food and drink at Meat and Potatoes:  AMAZING. Service:  Interesting  I say that because I feel like there is a bit too much of an attitude from the hostess and sometimes from the bartenders.  I wanted to stop in for drinks before a show and when the hostess asked if I had a reservation, I said no, we just wanted to stop in for drinks.  She continued to inform me that they were a very popular establishment and it is important to make reservations.  I asked if we could just sit at the bar and was told yes, but that tables were just for those with reservations.  I clearly mentioned that I was going to the bar, there was no need for her to tell me several times that they are popular.  When we got in, the bar was completely empty except for two seats.  Most tables were empty as well, but I do understand that they might be if people were coming in for later reservations.  Service at the bar was friendly and efficient.  They gave recommendations on which drinks to try and also suggested some of their most popular items.  I love steak tar tar and was excited to see it on the menu.  It isn't east to find on a menu and even harder to find a good version.  Theirs is served with an egg on top, aioli drizzled around the sides and peanuts.  The unique additions made one of my favorite dishes even more tasty.  I ate it slowly because I wanted to savor every bite and was actually sad when I took my last forkful.  I can't wait to try this dish from them again.  I also had the poutine.  The price seems steep for an appetizer of french fries, but the portion size is quite large and everything about them was tasty.  For drinks I sampled the Delicious Sour.  It was a perfect blend of the ingredients and I would order it again.  On another visit, I had a very different experience at the bar.  I almost felt talked down to by the bar tender once I said I wasn't going to be having any drinks.  Every time they walked over they mentioned how they have such great specialty drinks, they are known for their drinks, etc.  I get that, but there are a lot of reasons a person someone might not want to drink, no need to be pushy.  They also seemed to want to rush me out.  I felt like I wasn't trendy enough to be sitting at the bar and they wanted me out to get someone else in who better fit their image.    Overall, a great place with amazing food.  Just be aware that you might get some snobby treatment and be reminded of how great the restaurant you are in is."}
{"text":"One of our favorite digs downtown Pittsburgh. The bar is awesome for Pre-dinner drinks or late night cocktails. The kitchen is magnificent, with a great menu and expertly prepared dishes that remind you of big city restaurants. When in Pittsburgh this is one of the best spots to dine."}
{"text":"I've been to Meat & Potatoes several times and have had some very good dishes and some very.... Interesting dishes.  If you are going to try something a little more exotic, like the bone marrow, then I'd suggest you go with a few couples.  Have a few couples order things like bone marrow and have others order things like the Mac & Cheese (Out of this world).  That way everyone can share and you aren't stuck paying for something you may not care for.    In the end, my experiences at M&P have been pretty excellent.  They have a great drink selection and the food is generally very good.  I highly recommend the pork chop for dinner.  In spite of being very large it was so nice and juicy.  I'd say it was cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"I had the flat iron steak which was excellent. Very cool atmosphere inside with a circular bar. If you have to wait to be seated like we did, you can get a drink at the bar."}
{"text":"Tried a few times now....always left feeling very \"ehhhhh\" about the meal. We did the big steak dinner for 2 and were left with massive amounts of food and the service is always spotty. Not my fav"}
{"text":"While I've enjoyed every time I've gone to meat & potatoes, I have to say that it got so overhyped that I was almost setting myself up for some disappointment. It wasn't \"OMG\" amazing for me, it was just really good meat and starters. The brunch is also pretty good, but again not \"OMG\"."}
{"text":"First, let me say that you do need a reservation for this restaurant. I had to make my reservation for a party of 6 well in advance. We were there on a Monday night, 8/28/2017,  and the place was packed.   This place is definitely overrated.  First we ordered two appetizers, the Bone Marrow and the Wild Mushroom Risotto. The Bone Marrow was terrible. It was nothing but fat and grease. They provide bread with the marrow that is grilled but it was actually burnt and had a definite burnt taste. We asked for more bread and were told there would be a $3 charge but we didn't mind that at all. The bread again was burnt and had that burnt flavor. The Wild Mushroom Risotto on the other hand, was delicious.  In my party we ordered the Wagyu Flat Iron steak, the Lamb meatballs with pasta, the Spring Chicken, and Salmon.   The Wagyu Flat Iron steak was good but nothing to write home about. I have had better.  The Lamb Meatballs were good but the pasta that came with them was overcooked and rubbery.  The Spring Chicken was just okay and it was on the dry side. We have made juicier chicken at home.  The salmon was terrible. It was the worst tasting salmon we have ever had. It came with black rice that definitely had a different taste that nobody liked. The salmon had a fried egg on it too which seemed strange and didn't really pair well with the salmon.   In my party we ordered two specialty beers they had on tap, the Redstone Watermelon Nectar and the Greenflash Divine Sauvage. They were both excellent beers.  The service was excellent but the food was sub-par. You can get a better steak at Outback than what we had. Don't go here it is over priced and over hyped. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"First time here, first time in Pittsburgh. Came up for the Steelers game as a late birthday gift from the boyfriend. Found this place on Yelp and the food looked good. We had the mac & cheese brisket for an appetizer, so so good!!! The brisket was the best part actually but all in all delicious, we both thought.  I had the duck he had the lamb, med rare on both is the way to go. There was a pickle cucumber side for mine that was devine. He didn't offer me any of his lamb (not sure if this relationship will last lol) so I cant give a review about that. We sat at the bar because they do go by appt, not sure if its just cause it was Saturday and there was a hockey game tonight and football game tomorrow. We could either wait 45 min for a table or sit at the bar, we were here at 4:55, place opened at 5! By 5:15 bar was completely filled and only 2 tables opened...but not for long. Staff was amazing! Spoke to two other people at the bar a local and a fellow visitor from Jersey. Just a great crowd!!  I will definitely be back during the summer for warmer weather, and to enjoy more food (4 weeks post jaw surgery, so I was limited). Recommend for sure!"}
{"text":"I can see how some people might consider this an up-tight atmosphere. Sure the people look sophisticated but their friendly. The food was absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"Coming in for restaurant week, we found that atmosphere to be pretty casual with some good music in the background and almost a full house. Service was also pretty timely with decent wait times between food servings. From the presentation of the food, you could tell that the chefs really paid attention to how things came together.   Taken individually, each item would probably have been a 5-star dish. The confit chicken thigh was nice and tender with a nice side salad mixed in. The mac and cheese was very flavorful and surprisingly filling despite its small size. And who could complain about the pork chop with pork belly, a huge portion of meat that went perfectly with the squash grits, not to mention the roasted apple with foie gras on the side?   The only problem in the end was that taken together, we found the meal to be a bit on the heavy side. Something lighter like a soup instead of the mac would have worked well. Or if the mac had been removed and replaced with a dessert at the end. Maybe even a smaller portion of the pork chop/belly, and a different pairing for the foie gras or apple. For the entree, having both pork belly and foie gras on the same plate definitely became a bit hard to swallow comfortably, particularly after the cheesy mac. But for anyone who was able to enjoy the entire meal, I'd say it was definitely worth the price."}
{"text":"Went to the Cabaret Theater last night and made reservations for after the show.  Couldn't be any easier as the 2 share the same lobby.  Pork Chop was amazing with the bbq collard greens and topped with pork belly!! Yum...  Service was on point.  The only down side is know when the other show is letting out from the Benedum or you will get stuck in traffic trying to get out.  Also, skip dessert. The French toast was good but not great compared to the rest of the meal.  Happy to eat hear again in the future."}
{"text":"And we did returned 3 times already (and if we lived in the area it would be multiple times for sure). This is one of those rare restaurants that have a consistency of providing patrons with great experiences. This time was no exclusion. We left with full bellies of yummiest food and a happy smile on the faces. The surprise of this dinner was Tuna Crudo Special that was out of this world (which you wouldn't expect from the place called \"Meat & Potatoes\"). Thanks a lot to Chefs and Cru for never failing put a smile on our faces and the best memories of your place after we leave."}
{"text":"This place is lovely. If you eat meat or seafood that is, especially meat. Their salads look pretty good too but we didn't get to try those. We got a flatbread starter (with jam and goat cheese) and a lamb entree, a beef pot roast, and the salmon with black rice. All were tender and flavorful and the service was extremely attentive. The decor is fantastic - high ceilings, cool lighting and details, a lovely bar in the center of the room, and two different outdoor seating areas. We sat inside (I loved the dining chairs - sort of like a comfy sofa for one) and left stuffed and happy."}
{"text":"We started off with me trying to book this online and my bf calling in and trying to book it. He calls and they say they don't have any room for 2 hours. I get confused because I see there is still room on the website. So I book it via the website. I figured we could go and then eat somewhere else if it didn't work out.   Ok, cool. We go there and get seated. We order the giant steak everyone is getting, along with Brussels sprouts, fries, and pate. The pate is pretty delicious. The fries are good too, the bone marrow should have been toasted more and the large steak has a ton of fat and is burnt...   We also never get the Brussels sprouts. That's fine, we ate a lot and got full. We ask for the check. The Brussels sprouts that we never got to us are on there. Uh, ok so you're not going to give them to us but charge us for them? Good thing we checked before paying!   A lot of \"miscommunication\" going on here."}
{"text":"Just like everything else in downtown Pittsburgh, Meat and Potatoes is overpriced. That being said, you're probably paying more for the ambience than the food, which (as the name would suggest) is traditional American. I was actually really excited when I first stepped into this place. The menu reads like a who's who of American cuisine. Unfortunately, I may have ordered the wrong dish (lamb burger). I found it dry and unsatisfying. I'd definitely be willing to give M&P another chance once my meal ticket comes in."}
{"text":"Seriously great food and a unique atmosphere.  I've traveled the world and I have never seen another restaurant like it.  I just want to know who gives 3 stars because the place didn't have hot chocolate??? (Lauren C.) Does this place even look like it serves hot chocolate?? I mean really...  You might as well have asked for a Capri Sun."}
{"text":"dont get stuck in the seat where the servers keep bumping in to you wtf"}
{"text":"The brunch here is amazing and the portions are huge!!!!  Went with a large group and we ended up having our own little room which was nice since we aren't a quiet group.  The Bloody Mary bar was delicious and a meal in itself.  Pretty cool too that you can choose from different flavored infused alcohols to start with.  Definitely make reservations, but Get Your Butt here!!!"}
{"text":"Well, I know I'm in the minority here, which is ok by me... but I hoped for so much more when we came here. I guess I'm just too much of a traditionalist for a place like this.  Don't get me wrong, the food was cooked perfect. My favorite part of the meal was the bone marrow and the tenderness of the steak. So good. I just got lost on the grits and collard greens & pickled mushrooms that were served with it.  Like I said, I'm just too much of a Steak and Potato person to appreciate the variety of the plate.  The service was great, she knew all about the dishes and made recommendations. The atmosphere was good, music in the background and not too bright or dark for the lighting.  The seating, well, the seating was like we were in a group, RIGHT next to the people beside us. So close that the guy next to me jokingly was going to try my dessert! (it was hilarious but his wife was annoyed. haha!)  All in all, the food was good, the place was nice, just cramped and the service was great.  Just not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"Went here last night with a coworker on a business trip and we were both blown away.  Loved the well thought out food, the atmosphere, and the service. Good beer selection for me and my friend liked her wine. We had a delicious mushroom risotto for appetizer. The portion was more than enough and we left some in the bowl only because we didn't want to fill up too much.  I had the lamb burger-medium, as recommended by the chef. The generous serving of hand cut, shoestring fries were crispy and cooked until they were dark golden brown and served with a side of spicy ketchup, which was also fun. Our server was very knowledgable about the menu. Fun atmosphere too. Although I'm not in Pittsburgh often and I hope to make it back here sometime."}
{"text":"Now that I've been here a couple times and sampled of the a-maz-ing cocktails, I can safely say this downtown spot is the place to impress your friends in the 'burgh.   Definitely get the chicken and waffles during brunch time. It's huge and definitely shareable. The french fries are also a winning appetizer to share. French toast is good, but a little pricey for what it is.   Service here is outstanding, especially during peak hours (which always impresses me).   Both lunch and brunch are great, but I'd definitely get a reservation for either as it's a popular spot."}
{"text":"Bad service. The men bar tenders here definitely cater to the pretty girls. Even saw them knowingly  serve an under age girl one time about a year ago. The wait was not worth the food quality. My drink was good.. That's about it."}
{"text":"The BEST gastropub in Pittsburgh hands down. Make reservations or expect a very long wait. Brunch is a surprising delight with a Bloody Mary bar and a live DJ on Sunday's. Short rib hash and chicken and waffles are to die for."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place to take a date! It's very classy and well decorated.  The chicken livers were amazing!!! I had the salmon for my main dish and it was filling and very tasty."}
{"text":"When a bartender is wearing suspenders, listen to said bartender's advice on cocktails and the menu.   I struggled with the menu choices. Everything sounded amazing and I wish I could have tried a bite of each dish. But I also thought I could get really good fish tacos, or pasta or cheese plates elsewhere. I was secretly craving pizza, so I lingered on the flatbread list. I decided on the mushroom/truffle.   \"Are you a vegetarian?\" the bartender asked when I ordered. \"No, not really,\" I replied. \"Then don't get the mushroom,\" he said. After all, the place is called \"Meat and Potatoes.\" So I asked for a small order of the fried taters with truffle mayo and the short rib (braised beef, bleu cheese) flatbread.  The Belgian-style frites were great, but I ate half of them and used the truffle mayo as a dip for the light, flaky, how-did-they-do-it buttery flatbread crust. The beef was tender and paired well with the cheeses and spicy greens. The pickled red onions were sweet and could have been sliced much thinner. Carmelized may have been a better option. Roasted, diced beets could have also given it a pop of red and and earthy note. Overall delicious.   The guys next to me at the bar were drinking the bartender's rum old fashioneds. A fan of brandy old fashioneds, I gave the cocktail a chance after learning the bar didn't have Korbel brandy (nope). Allspice syrup was the key to making this impossibly tiny, impossibly strong, impossibly delicious cocktail taste like Christmas and the solution for world peace. A common spice for braised beef, it paired well with the short rib flatbread. Ask for it.   Probably shouldn't go here if you're in a BIG hurry to eat or make the curtain call at one of the area theaters. Even at the bar, service was slow and the place was packed (reservations are pretty key here). But this place lends itself to taking your time, slipping slowly, and enjoying well-crafted food. As casual-hip as it was inspired, I had a great meal. So glad I went."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite go to restaurant for any occasion.  Even just for the hell of it.   I've been here about ten times, I have yet to be disappointed.  By far my favorite item is the Sweet Potato Agnolotti.  I hope it comes back with the fall menu.  I've had it 4 times I've been there. The bone marrow and pate and definitely another go to of mine.  My husband swears by the mussels. Planning another girls night here VERY SOON!"}
{"text":"This place is for the birds. Pretentious hipster kids with shitty attitudes who cant make a drink. Food was over priced and each dish had a salt shaker a piece poured on it... From the service to the food... Eh..."}
{"text":"I'd been hearing great things about this place for ages and I finally got myself there...and I definitely see what all the hype is about. We tried the pigs ears because why not? They were the perfect appetizer - spicy, salty, fatty, tangy. In fact everything we ordered exceeded our expectations, which of course had started out pretty high."}
{"text":"Pork Had so Much meat. Food Was excellent  And there are a handful of outdoor seats."}
{"text":"An awesome restaurant, especially if you are hungry.  I came here with my boss, who picked up the tab thankfully because it was expensive.  However, I had a wonderful meal; the double cut stuffed pork chops.  We sat outside in October, and since there was a little chill in the air, I was very happy to have the warm blanket for my shoulders.  I couldn't finish my entree, but left very happy and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"So I had heard from several people to check this restaurant out and finally was able to drop in. The restaurant aesthetics were great and feels like a giant restaurant even though it isn't a huge space. Definitely a comfortable environment. The food was great. No complaints there. My only issue is with the cocky types of bartenders who are always trying to impose their weird creations on me. It's getting pretty old and it happened here. When someone very directly orders a classic drink just go with it. But I ended up with a drink that was based off of what I ordered but only it incorporated a couple ingredients with very overpowering and distinct flavors. Especially ones that might be off putting or are far away from what someone initially ordered.  Maybe I'm picky? But instead of trying to show off your creation maybe ease into it and ask some questions first about what someone likes. Don't just say \"trust me\" and not tell someone what you're planning on doing. I don't need surprises. Just the correct expectations for what I am ordering."}
{"text":"I was so excited to get a table here around Christmas when back home for the holidays. The food was amazing and the service was on point. It lives up to the hype. Had to try the bone marrow, which was meaty, fatty and flavorful. The mussels I had were fabulous too, with a slightly spicy broth. Enjoyed the devils on horseback, just wish there had been more. My husband got chicken of all things, which he thought was super tasty.  Someday I'm going back and taking my Dad to tackle the tomahawk."}
{"text":"I love this place.  It's decorated beautifully and the menu is fantastic. I could probably eat nothing but their fried chicken for the rest of my life and (prematurely) die happy.  I can't say anything bad about this place AT ALL.  They also have a very good beer list featuring a lot of local selections and good cocktails.  Yum.  We generally try to squeeze in a visit to this place when we're in town visiting family.  I also think that Meat and Potatoes is far superior to Butcher and the Rye, even though I know they're essentially the same thing.  It just sort of feels like that place is a sad copy of what was already done perfectly."}
{"text":"Absolutely go here for a meal.  Sat at the bar.  Bartender was lovely, entertaining and could make a great drink.  That evening it was a negroni punch.  He recommended the pork chop -- it was the size of my head!  Cooked at medium, it was tender, juicy, succulent...can't say enough about it except next time, bring a friend a share!  The slaw was delicious and had the right amount of acidity and freshness to cut thru the richness of the pork chop.  Nom nom nom!"}
{"text":"Good restaurant and great service. Two guys with me had the $78 ribeye for two. Well worth every penny. Steak could have maybe used a touch more kosher salt or something, but still great and cooked to a perfect med rare.  I had the $48 wagyu flat iron steak special. It was seasoned really well but was tough. Not at all worth the price but the experience was still positive. Will be back on next trip to downtown."}
{"text":"Yum!!  Pot roast was more than I expected....could have used a little more potatoes. I will return!"}
{"text":"So glad this place opened up. It fills the desperately needed niche of after theatre dining. The atmosphere is relaxed and casual (unlike Cafe Zao, the previous tenant of the same space), and the food is really tasty!  I am also a fan of their unapologetic meat-lover attitude. (There are some limited vegetarian options, though true vegans are probably out of luck.)   I recommend the bone marrow, the lamb, and their daily mussels. Also loved the panna cotta dessert (was salty caramel when I was last there).   The service is a bit mixed, depending on whom you get.  When asked for suggestions for a non-alcoholic drink, one waiter shrugged and said \"water?\" while another got the bartender to make a super delicious drink (peach and ginger soda with mint and stuff).   I'm looking forward to going back and trying more of their dishes."}
{"text":"Awesome brunch with a bloody mary bar (the best I've ever seen). Also, great deserts and cocktails."}
{"text":"Well the place is pretty nice but the food here is somewhat no so good as I expected. The smoked lamb and duck breast is fine. But the mussels are like over cooked. Not so a cost effective place for dinner I mean"}
{"text":"We went here for dinner last night after seeing an hour plus wait at Tako. I figured this was a steak place based on the name but the menu was very diverse and a little too funky for me. The steak selection was minimal but I ended up getting the lamb meatballs with pasta. The flavors were very strong but tasty. It became quite rich about half way through. The drink menu seemed extensive and they had some cool craft beers on tap. The vibe was upscale/trendy. A DJ started performing around 9ish (on a Monday night) which I didn't expect. The restaurant turned slightly into a club which I wasn't in the mood for. Prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"Love the mussels appetizer with a salad as a meal."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and delicious food! Service was great too and they accommodated us even though we were late for our reso."}
{"text":"While Meat & Potatoes is certainly one of the trendier places in downtown Pittsburgh, and does have good food, I would leave the food at that- good.  While you will certainly enjoy your meal, for the price the food is, I would need to go again for a special occasion or reason. My favorite part was probably the interior/atmosphere over the quality of food."}
{"text":"Meat and Potatoes is an excellent restaurant and certainly one of the best (if not the best) downtown.  The service is generally excellent on multiple visits and the food never ceases to amaze.  From what I am told by my dining companions, the bone marrow is excellent, though not my thing personally. You can get a lot more than Meat and Potatoes here, but they certainly excel at most everything we've tried. Definitely worth a visit downtown (and a hit to the wallet)."}
{"text":"Extremely overrated dinning experience. Decided to give it a second chance and came to brunch, ordered the chicken and waffles. Waffles were cold and tasted like a bisquik mix. Chicken was unseasoned. Wait/bar staff was decent so if I were to return it would be only for drinks."}
{"text":"Awesomeness!!! I have been here many times. Some of the waitstaff isn't that great, but that happens everywhere. The food is amazing!! I have never had a disappointing meal here and the cocktails are fantastic. The last time I ate here, I over indulged and ended up with the meat sweats all night long."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite brunch spot in Pgh. Great spot to bring visitors from out of town. I've been 4-5 times, ordered something different each time and everything is always absolutely delicious. They have a bloody mary bar...but I usually go with ordering mine from the bar because they are SO good and I don't want to ruin it trying to make it myself.  Awesome atmosphere, comfy tables (could hang out for hours) and really amazing soundtrack. Make a reservation...it gets packed."}
{"text":"Really enjoyable dinner. Flank steak was wonderful. Ceviche and duck were delicious too."}
{"text":"The place was ok, nothing super special. I got the pub burger which was really good, and a large portion. Definitely need extra napkins with that one! For an appetizer, I got the smoked brisket mac & cheese. The brisket was very fatty, which some people may like, but I am not a fan of. Seats are very close together but overall it was pretty good. May go back if friends want to go, but I wouldn't be the one suggesting it."}
{"text":"We were in from Los Angeles for the holidays and wanted to find a restaurant to celebrate our two-year anniversary. SERVICE: i called earlier in the day to find out if i could make a reservation. the hostess said that the ONLY reservation was at 4pm. I didn't book that one, as it was way to early, but we decided to take a chance and drive into the city anyway. When we arrived around 7pm there were several empty two-tops and the bar was about half empty. we chose the bar. EXCELLENT service from the three or so bartenders! FOOD: so beyond good. i wish i had three stomachs so i could have tried everything. we shared the shortrib flatbread, tartare, fried brussel sprouts, and creme brulee..... COCKTAILS: again, excellent. i order a Manhattan everywhere I go and this one (ahem....two) were superb. also had a couple of cans of the Sofia Blanc de Blanc (bubbly in a cute little can! don't worry, they provide a champagne flute too)  overall, i wish it were here in LA. read a full review with photos over on my blog: http://hourglassandbloom.wordpress.com/2013/01/07/meat-and-potatoes/"}
{"text":"Took a date night in Pittsburgh over the holidays.  Made a reservation for 2 a week in advance, which was a good thing because the place was booked solid.  After getting very good cocktails at the bar (sloe gin fizz and glenshaw sour) we were seated at exactly 7p.  Not a big restaurant - it's one big room, high ceilings, with the bar at the center and tables around the edges and had a nice lively feel.    Draft list was on a chalkboard on the wall, and had some great seasonal and local selections.  Only special was the mussels of the day, which looked good but we're not mussels people.  Started with pate, which was an ample portion, and the seasonal salad, both hit the spot.  Lamb burger was good-sized and excellent.  Korean Reuben could have used a little more kimchi since it really did go well with the corn beef, but it was an interesting and enjoyable (and large) sandwich.  Couldn't even finish all the french fries served with each sandwich since we wanted dessert.  We went with gingerbread cake which was fresh and delicious but we couldn't help thinking it would have been better after 10 seconds in a microwave.  They brought it with a candle since we were celebrating my husband's birthday.  Service was professional and friendly and the server was helpful with beer and food selections.  We were happy with the prices we paid which were very reasonable for the quantity and quality of what we got.  We are partial to gastropubs in general and this was a very good one - would recommend to anyone to try."}
{"text":"Have had dinner here a few times and always been good.  Today I had brunch for the 1st time.   It was delicious!  Had the eggs in purgatory.  Hubby had some type of pork ragu w poached eggs that was very good as well.    He had bloody marys from the make your own bar.  I had the brunch punch.   It was sooooo tasty!  I could have drank 10 of them.   Today was a spiced rum w cinnamon & apple cider.   Will def be back for brunch!"}
{"text":"This place is exactly what it seems - comfort food done \"fancy\" as the person who sat next to me at the bar said. The bar had had to find beers and a great wine selection...you know you're getting old when you start caring about that. The beef tartare I had for my app was so good it made me rethink the ones I had been served in France. For dinner we had lamb and steak and both were perfect. The restaurant is tiny so be prepared to wait for a table and get to know the people around you. Our waiter was funny, engaging and well versed on the menu so they get extra credit for a super staff. However they train them they do it right!"}
{"text":"This place is a carnivore's heaven on Earth.   Last month my boyfriend and I took a mini road trip from New York to Pittsburgh to visit my sister and brother in law. I did some research about the places I wanted to visit while I was there. This was at the top of my list.  We called around 9pm to see if there were any tables open. We were told the wait was only 10 minutes and we were seated right away when we arrived! I don't believe this is something that happens frequently; we were very lucky.   We were seated right near the kitchen. Normally, I wouldn't be too fond of this, because of the foot traffic with servers and busboys etc, but with these huge, comfy, throne-like chairs, nothing was going to get me down.  We started with drinks, my boyfriend ordered the First Word and I ordered the Desperado. Both were really unique and enjoyable, with a swift kick. I suggest the Desperado only to people who really enjoy tequila, like me. Otherwise, I think it may be too much for people to handle.  Instead of ordering full meals, we decided to order a bunch of appetizers and eat tapas style. It was the best decision we've made, to date.  We had fried pickles (well, everyone else had fried pickles since I don't enjoy them, but they loved them.) We also had the fried Brussels. Oh my god, so good. And the dipping sauce was great, too! The tartare was different than any I've ever had before, probably because the meat was chunky rather than super ground down, but I really enjoyed it. The egg that accompanied it made the dish. The risotto was good, but probably the least successful of all the dishes. Texture wasn't that of an amazing risotto, but it tasted good. Lastly, the bone marrow. Oh my god . 3 huge half bones filled with creamy meaty goodness. I have dreamed about it quite often since my encounter with it. It was incredible. Also, it was only $14. Are you kidding? I'm from New York where this can be upwards of $30 and people would still pay. I was in shock.  For dessert we had some sort of cheesecake and bread pudding. They were good, also!   Prices are on point, the food was incredible, drinks were good, and the atmosphere was great. This is a destination I plan on visiting every time I'm in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"A Bloody Mary bar where you pick your vodka and then add as many ingredients as you want before topping off with tomato juice.  That was a good enough reason to want to come back.  The flavors in the Huevos Rancheros were a guarantee that I will come back.  A perfect Sunday brunch place!"}
{"text":"The bone marrow is incredible, possibly the best meal I've had in Pittsburgh. Service was impeccable, and I also enjoyed the extensive drink selection. I would recommend calling ahead before going with a party as I went with four others and waited over an hour (the wait, however, was absolutely worth it). The decor is interesting and up-to-date as well, if that matters for you."}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere. I ordered 2 things: the beet salad which was so refreshing and had a beautiful presentation, and the \"Pork\" which was a MASSIVE pork chop perfectly cooked (seriously. How was the center of that thing so buttery and soft???) with 2 strips of pork belly on top. The chop chop as covered with a delicious baked beans side dish/sauce, and (because I don't like collard greens) I substituted confit potato wedges. The flavors were spot on. So smoky and tender and juicy. Ugh. So good. I was also stunned at how large my dinner was. The 2 couples on either side of me couldn't believe it either. One of them asked if they could take a picture of it. I ended having to take 1/2 of the whole meal home. I don't live in the area but if I did this would be a frequent on my least.  If there's anything negative about my experience, it was that I had a really hard time seeing my meal. I like a dark atmosphere... but I literally couldn't tell what was on my fork while I was eating the salad. Was kind of fun, though. Thanks for the delicious meal!"}
{"text":"My son and his girlfriend went for their Anniversary.  Food was amazing, great atmosphere and wonderful staff!"}
{"text":"Wow!  If you are a committed carnivore, this is the place for you.  We had a party of five on a Saturday night at 9:00 pm.  Place was full.  Ordered for appetizers the kobe corn dog, devil on horseback, fried pickles and fried brussel sprouts (when you have to have vegetables, fry it out. :-)). The fried brussel spouts were really good, and would definitely reorder every time I'm here.  Fried pickles were also tasty, but would have probably preferred a thinner cut. Kobe corn dog was also delicious, but if you are planning to order a large entree (see below) this will fill you up too much.  The Devil on Horseback which is a date stuffed with manchego cheese and wrapped in bacon was also excellent, but the fried brussel sprouts were my favorite   Leaves were nice and crunchy, nicely salted,  awesome.  Now, for the entree, we ordered two  steak for two entrees for the five of us.  That's 34 oz of a tomahawk ribeye, with bone marrow gratin and steak fries.  This place knows how to cook steak, and that is an understatement.  Our steak was a perfect medium rare with a nice outside char.  It was topped with a mushroom sauce with huge pieces of mushrooms. The meat was so tender, you could cut it with a butter knife.  The bone marrow gratin was so rich, but the crunchy breadcrumb topping was a beautiful offset.   And the amazing thing to top it all off, was that dinner was less than $40 per person with wine and drinks.  I come from NY, and that is just not possible in the Big Apple.  You go to a great steakhouse in NY,and plan to spend three times that amount for five people.   We like to visit Pittsburgh because it's a great city with my favorite football team.  Meat & Potatoes is just another reason to take that special trip to the Steel City.  This is an awesome place!"}
{"text":"I LOVED this place. Found it on Yelp and went with a friend for dinner two nights ago and I am still dreaming about the flavor party we had. Wow. We ate at the bar as all tables were full. Great, great service. Yes the bar tenders are kind of this 'dork' trendy for the gastropub scene but they were quite knowledgeable about food and drink. If you were unsure about a draft beer they would give you a taste to see if it's what you wanted to go with.  Started with the pulled pork flatbread. YUM. Arugula, blue cheese, cheddar, horseradish, pickled onion - all delicious. My friend and I ate it up. I had the Salmon with black rice / kim chi / cucumber / korean hot sauce / chinese sausage / fried egg / ginger scallion relish. Mind blowing. I mean really, really creative dish. The salmon had crispy skin and that is the first time I've ever wanted to keep eating the skin. Everything just had a really great marriage of flavors. My friend had the hanger steak and was also impressed."}
{"text":"Horrendous experience.  We arrived 10:15 a.m. And said our wait was over 2 hours.  We had drinks in the lobby and several couples were immediately served ahead of us.  Sarah the Mgr. got involved and took care of us immediately."}
{"text":"Made a reservation here for 7:30 pm on a Monday night and we were seated after a 5 minutes wait. The ambiance was nice, a little too loud for my taste for dinner but that is expected in a gastropub. Our waitress explained the daily specials in detail and was very attentive throughout our dinner.   We ordered fried pickles as a snack and meat & potatoes for 2 as the main dish. I'm glad that was all we ordered because that main dish was humongous. Fried pickles were delicious, very light and crisp. And the main dish was awesome too, cooked just as we wanted and came with delicious mushrooms and potatoes (as the name suggests).  The reason for 4 stars is because we weren't informed that our main dish would take an hour to prepare and our wait for our food got a little anxious towards the end like \"did they forget about us?\" etc. Other than that it was a very smooth experience."}
{"text":"Fantastic meal, great decor, and excellent drinks - need I say more?.?.?  Ok here goes.  The Caeser Salad had Pig Ear, Pickled Okra, and a Fried Egg that gooed out to make a warm compliment to the light dressing... Fantastic.  The mussels had bacon, salmon roe, and fennel... What how do those thing go together, extremely well that's how.  Hangar steak had some nice bitter micro greens, uber crispy potatoes, and a nice bright sauce to pull it all together... Drinks were unique, especially my barrel aged Buffalo Trace Manhattan.  Booooom.  If you are in Pitt, go here... the end."}
{"text":"As far as tacos go, I've been more impressed.  As far as the ambiance, drink choices, and service go, this place tops the charts. I blame myself for ordering catfish tacos (which were fine.. But not great. Mainly, they lacked any sort of definitive flavor, were on flour not corn shells, and were a bit dry..) when I probably should have gotten a delicious hunk of meat or fantastic dish of smoked brisket mac & cheese, like the other people in my party.  Everything was beautifully plated and well executed. Our service was quick, waitress Missy was kind and caring, and the entire experience made me want to go back."}
{"text":"Best bloody mary bar in the city!"}
{"text":"The place is pretty small and we were thankful we made reservations. I enjoyed the decor. Wait staff was nice, polite and friendly. I hate how alot of smaller places like this have you cramed right up beside the next table, but at least staff here tried to space people out as best as they could.  Now for me it was over priced for anything other than a plain burger. So we both got burgers. I asked to have muchrooms added to mine since I had a choice of swiss cheese, and either the waiter is new or thats a strange request..since the waiter acted like it may be an issue, and they may not have them ( in my head I'm thinking this suposed to be a place of meat, what do you mean you may not be able to add mushrooms) but as an Avid mushroom lover it wasn't strange to me. After checking with the chef he said it was not a problem  ( was charged 2bucks for them) my burger and fries were cooked perfectly even though I asked for ranch on the side and was told they did not have it(what!). ALSO my burger meat seemed much smallert than the bun.  The food was enjoyable, it was a comfortable relaxed setting. However I do believe for us this was just a one-time try."}
{"text":"I finally made it to this restaurant, it took three years but it was well worth it. Had to grab a quick meal prior to going to see a show at the August Wilson Center. I ordered Pot Roast, it was delicious and it was served in Le Creuset pan. I washed it down with a whiskey sour it was very good and potent.  My sister ordered the Smoked Wing appetizer she said they were good."}
{"text":"Went on Sunday for brunch and had the  chicken and waffles (huge portions). The meal was amazing and I partook in their Bloody Mary bar which I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Came here before the Pirates game. We were visiting from Chicago. We both ordered the Pub Burger and it was outstanding!  Highly recommend. The place has a cool ambiance and good drink/beer list. I didn't love the honey bee mezcal drink but everything else was great."}
{"text":"This was where Darren wanted to celebrate his birthday, and celebrate we did!  So much has already been said about this place that I have little to add and nothing negative to say. The tables are close together, but it is cozy. The dim lights make the atmosphere romantic. I drooled over the marinated olives! Be careful though, as the olives do contain their pits. I also enjoyed one of their 3 flavors of mussels of the day, a beer and mustard green concoction with chunks of bacon. The bacon soaked the beer flavoring up and tasted potent!  The broth left after devouring the muscles was the consistency of a soup. The server brought me garlic bread to dip in it. This place does have coat check which helps to save space at the tables.  Speaking of tables, they are pretty small but the staff is quick to get your used dishes out of the way before the next course is presented."}
{"text":"It was tough getting a reservation here, but definitely worth all the effort! The brunch here is delicious! We ordered the Pate, chicken and waffles, French toast, breakfast board and short rib hash. All were delicious and the servings were so sooo generous! The French toast is a must try, more than the all popular chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"Not all components of the meal were impressive, but I really enjoyed the specials that they had the particular evening we went: Squid Ink Pasta and Steak and Frites.  The Squid Ink Pasta had a great texture and chew to it, and none of the \"seafood-y\" taste, smell, or grittiness. Lots of fresh seafood and a great tomato sauce to finish! Very impressed. I thought that the Steak and Frites would be your typical thinnish-strip steak, but the steak we received was thick, cooked perfectly, and super tender. The frites were very, very salty.  We also tried the Bone Marrow (described at \"meat butter\") by the staff, and it came with grilled bread, gremolata and pickled onions. It was a bit too fatty and greasy for me, and I wasn't a particular fan, but I had to try it since I was there. The Fried Brussel Sprouts were less impressive- super salty and the sprout leaves weren't that crisp as I've seen at some other restaurants. Lemon aioli was good.  The Smoked Brisket Mac and Cheese was fine- nothing particularly stood out to me, and if I were to return, I would try something else.   In general, service was fine. We enjoyed the Squid Ink Pasta and Steak and Frites, though they are not on the regular menu. Overall, a lot of the dishes were on the salty side."}
{"text":"Mmmm Mmmm Mmmm.  Got the pappardelle pasta, would have licked the plate if it was appropriate.  My friend got a steak and cleaned her plate as well. Our server was super attentive and the atmosphere was pretty calm despite the restaurant being packed. I would go back any time!"}
{"text":"Second time back and it was even better than the first. As a lover of sweet wines, the Riesling they had (I can kick myself for not writing down the name) was probably one of the best I've ever had. Appetizers; poutine and the whiskey wings. Oh my gawd, was that poutine amazing. I mean, it is the second time I've had it at M&P and I think it was better this time.  I wish I had some right now, and its only 10 am. The wings were full of great flavor. They were about half a point too spicy for me, so I only ate a few, but the hubbie loved them.   My entree was the short rib flat bread. After we ordered but before it came out I overheard the lady at the table recommending menu items to her date, saying 'order anything but the flatbread, they are good, but not nearly as good as everything else'. Sad trombone for me. I agree with her though, it was good, but... Not the shining star of the meal.  I need to make it priority to hit up meat and potatoes more often. We love it!"}
{"text":"I REALLY enjoyed my experience at Meat & Potatoes! I had an 8:15 reservation, and my table was ready for us as soon as my party of 4 arrived. The place had a trendy and cool ambiance. It was packed on a Saturday night, but I didn't feel like it was crowded. They had a really nice drink menu with extensive options! The service was fantastic. Our server was knowledgeable about the menu, answered any questions, and made sure our water glasses were never empty.  Ok, now on to the food! Our party ordered the marrow (we HAD to try it) the fried pickles, and the bread that came with butter and jam. The marrow was cool. I think it was kinda a one and done thing, but I don't regret it. The fried pickles, however, were amazing!! Highly recommend! I got the beet salad and the buffalo chicken Mac & cheese. Both were delicious. My other family members ordered the lamb shank and the pot roast, and they both were very very pleased with their meals!  In the end, Meat & Potatoes gets a solid well deserved 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Yelp does it again.  New place, new city, and we got a home run with Meat and Potatoes!  Drinks?  Off the Charts.  Mixes, syrups, bitters and flavors that you can't wait to try.  We had the best bartender Jason, who offered advice on Apps and entrees knowing we were out of towners.  Lobster Mac and beef tartare, were amazing, but the tartare takes the win.  Pork chop and duck breast was next.  Both were incredible, but the pork chop which was highly regarded from numerous patrons stole the show.   Go here.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is impossible to get into without a reservation. And even with a reservation we had to make one at 10pm at night. We came on time for our reservation but for some reason they still made us wait 15 minutes to be seated. As when we walked in there were several tables empty, so I'm not sure why we even had to wait, especially when we made the reservation a week in advance.  I came with a group of 5 and we wanted to order finger food that we could share. We ordered mostly the snacks and flatbreads.   Fried pickles - just as it sounds, pickles with a layer of fried batter Buttermilk Fried chicken livers - didn't like this as much, I guess I'm not a big liver fan Fried Taters w/ Mayo - tastes like regular cripsy, thin french fries The Salty Pig flatbread - very very salty, couldn't taste anything but very salty cured meats, we didn't like this one as much Mushroom Flatbread - this one was great! more delicate than the Salty Pig, you can really taste the mushrooms Thai Mussels - loved the Thai mussels, mussels were fresh  Overall, I was a little bit disappointed by the food but it's probably our fault for ordering the fried foods, which is really nothing special. I wish we ordered the bone marrow or something from the main entrees, which is probably what Meat and Potatoes is better known for. I would come back here again to try more than their bar-type foods.  The servers were friendly though. I wish they recommended items to us, but they were nice enough to cut our flatbread for us when we asked them to."}
{"text":"What a great spot! Long weekend in Pittsburgh, and I was told this was a spot to try, so the group I was with came here for brunch on a Saturday. It wasn't overly crowded, which was nice, they were playing amazing hits from the 90s and the sun was shining through the big windows at the front of the restaurant. Meat and Potatoes doesn't want to come off pretentious, hence the name and they succeeded. Just served great food and great drinks. I had to get the chicken and waffles because they were too good to pass up, and had a rosemary infused vodka cocktail with some champagne! Delicious. Serving size was large and in charge, my friend and I could have split the chicken and waffles easily and all other meals at the table were the same. No complaints! Definitely recommend it for one meal while visiting Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I have been all over the world and this is one of the top dining experiences ever!   The restaurant itself is very cool.  The people working there are awesome and knowledgeable. The drinks are great and the beer selection is good.  The food is OUT OF THIS WORLD!  Apps:  pimento cheese, Brussels sprouts and pigs ears are AWESOME!  Every entree ordered was awesome!  The Pub Burger is the BEST burger I have ever had!  Smoked Pork Chop with bone marrow reduction was incredible! And their collard greens are the best ever (and I am from the south!).  What a great experience and will go there every time I am in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Had an amazing dinner last night at Meat and Potatoes. The Ribeye for 2 was truly worth the 4 hour drive from Philly!!! Extreme flavor, perfectly cooked, and throughly filling! The host stand also serves as a stand out of amazing service as they were helpful, caring and worked with our early arrival when they didn't have too. The only two things from a five star review is the seating and service. Seating was too tiny. In other words, even only ordering the ribeye for 2 almost took the entire space. Plus the bench my son sat on,and commented on by the other person on the bench, seemed broken to the point that they sat on their jackets to get more height. Lastly, the service seemed put out, lacked warmth and, more importantly, no real attention to our table even though it took 45 minutes for our meal to arrive."}
{"text":"Ugh!! So good, it hurts. This is place is cool, hip, and decoratively perfect. The brunch is incredible! They have an amazing Bloody Mary bar, you choose your preference of infused vodka, and then go to the stocked bar and spruce it up to your liking. They have shrimp, various marinated olives, huge strips of bacon and every fixing you could ever want. I ordered the huevos rancheros ( so good) and my husband ordered the chicken and waffles. They literally give you a whole chicken with it. The DJ was playing some funky African music but I was digin' it. I loved the experience."}
{"text":"A pretty greasy meal overall.  We did enjoy the fried brussel sprouts.  The mussels with sausage and broccoli rabe were kind of bland.  Maybe we should have tried the green curry mussels."}
{"text":"Before I came here, I had a friend ask, \"Is there even a menu? Or is it just meat and potatoes?\" It is SO MUCH MORE.  I'd been wanting to go here for a while, and I finally had the presence of mind to snag a reservation during Pittsburgh Restaurant Week. My date and I both got the PRW fixed three course menu.   ATMOSPHERE & SERVICE: Meat & Potatoes is a constantly busy place, especially at peak dinner hours when we went. Rather than being overly loud or hectic though, I felt like all the people around us created this vibrant energy through the restaurant. All the while, our server was patient and attentive and added to the great experience.   FOOD: the restaurant week menu was beautifully crafted, with a lot of diverse flavor profiles. We started out with a tart crudo, followed by a savory squid ink pasta, then pork ribs with a sweet cranberry sauce. Of course, I had to add on a dessert, which was a little lemon meringue pie in a jar. They were small portions, but each dish was wonderfully crafted.   My date and I both really enjoyed our plates. It didn't blow our minds, but the creativity of the dishes was really nothing I'd seen before. It's absolutely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Industry nights on Monday are the hottest spot in the city. Delicious food, refreshing drinks, cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food ok....Not worth the hype, charcuterie was decent but some of the meat overly salty, had the Wagyu beef which was good but accompanying sides were meh. Personally I wouldn't go back and deal with the crowds and insanely small tables."}
{"text":"While the food was great as always. It literally took 2 hours for wings and burgers on a night that wasn't busy. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I came here with coworkers on a work trip for dinner. The atmosphere is really cool. The menu has a lot of variety and the prices and pretty reasonable. We were coincidentally here during restaurant week. I got the meatloaf from the restaurant week menu and it was awesome. The portions are HUGE. I could only eat about half my meal. I would definitely check this place out if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Took my dad for his birthday to Meat and Potatoes. I highly recommend making a reservation or else you will be sitting at the bar. Excellent lunch selections at reasonable prices. Along with their lunch menu that changes seasonally, they have daily specials. On the particular day we went, my dad and I both enjoyed the Asian noodle bowel which was fantastic. It had fried wontons, grilled pork, broccoli, onions, and jalapeños. Portions are enough that you aren't still hungry but don't walk out thinking you've gained 20 pounds. Their desserts are worth the extra bucks as well. Awesome atmosphere - no complaints!"}
{"text":"Bone marrow, mussel and duck. Too much for two people. Great food with reasonable price!"}
{"text":"This establishment is amazing. Definitely one of my favorites and go to restaurants.   I've celebrated my birthday there for the past 2 years (among other special occasions).   The waitstaff, bartenders, and host staff are friendly, courteous, and always on point. The waitstaff and bartenders are very attentive and knowledgable.   I have never been disappointed with the food. The menu frequently updates and the food is always prepared perfectly. I recently had a special, the bone in filet, it was so delicious. My photo does not do it justice. The fried pickles are amazing, the bone marrow, the ribeye, pretty much everything on the menu. They always have a great selection of beer as well.   Definitely one of the best places around, if you have not been, I suggest you go!"}
{"text":"I really can't say enough about this place.    My girlfriend and I were passing through Pittsburgh on our way to my niece's wedding and managed to stumble into this place after hours.  We'd landed in Cleveland around 6 pm and didn't get to the Burgh until after 9:30.  We only wanted to dump our luggage at our hotel and find something cool/unique/local (non-fast-foody) to eat.  Later we'd find out that we'd gotten lucky.  Because it was so late, we were able to get a table as soon as we rambled in . . . .   Our order: fried pickles, poutine and the smoked, thick-cut (four bones) pork chop with house-made baked beans, spicy greens and a couple strips of charred/OMG/nom-nom-nom pork belly.  We've had fried pickles before and they were . . . I don't know . . . amusing?  A novelty?  These hit all the taste quadrants on the tongue--the thick cut of pickle is game-changing--and we could've eaten them by the dozen.  The poutine came with fresh, airy mozzarella and long-simmered, in-house gravy.  It was a meal unto itself.  And the pork chop?  Jesus.  It was gigantic but jaw-dropping: part ham (Christmas!), part porky chop (4th of July!). . . and all char, smoke and sauce.  I also have to say: the service was both casual and stellar.  Even at 10 pm, there were three friendly servers taking care of us all night.  Not a small thing.  We felt like we were at home--if home were a five-star restaurant.  So, even if we don't need to, we'll still toot the horn for this place.  We were visiting from Los Angeles, which isn't devoid of great, innovative (and even reasonably-priced) restaurants and food trucks.    But now we wish that we had this restaurant here . . . ."}
{"text":"We've never been here before and will never come again. We came with some beautiful young ladies to treat them to dinner and a Musical. What should have been a pleasant evening immediately became one of disrespect & ignorance. When I walked in with my daughter and her friends to get them a table I asked the hostess for a table for them & a table for myself and my husband. I was immediately told,\" we don't split parties\" and the hostess made a face of disgust at me. I then, calmly, stated to her that there would be separate checks and that she should seat our two different parties as requested. She & the young man then gave me the ugliest faces in front of my daughter and her friends. When I asked to speak to the manager he came out and it was apparent that he wanted to defend his host staff more than he wanted to fix the situation with the poor customer service. Needless to say we didn't stay, and we won't darken their doorstep ever again. We value ourselves, but obviously they didn't feel the same. When did it become okay to treat customers with such blatant displays of ignorance?"}
{"text":"Had the Lamb Burger, which was delicious! They have a good wine selection as well."}
{"text":"Food was great and super flavorful- only con was that it was a bit on the smaller side.    HOWEVER, that have an amazing spirit selection; pappy van winkle 20 year was the most amazing pour ;)  Decor & music is a bit confusing but the excellent service, food, and drinks make up for it"}
{"text":"Went here with a group for work.  We had been given a back room due to the size of the group, however with the weather, many flights were cancelled so we missing missing about 1/2 of what we should have been.   We were greeted when we came in, and were waiting for more of the group to show up.   When we were seated, we were missing 9 of the group.  There was a pre-printed menu on the tables with a partial selection from the main menu.  For me, I was disappointed because I already checked out the online menu and knew what i wanted, and none of it was on this menu!  When the wait person came around to take our orders, I asked her if I could have the lamb meatballs.  She promptly told me they don't have them and that i had to stick to the menu in front of me. Full disclosure, I didn't like her attitude.  There was plenty of food, we tried several apps had a salad option and entrees.  Each table ordered what ever apps they wanted but when they came out - they did not come to where they were ordered.  We were given fried pickles, and we did not order them and we had ordered 2 of the smoked wings and were given one.  There were two tables in the room so I do think better attention could have been paid.  The Plain Jane burger was just that - plain - nothing special.  The bar scene did look like the place to be.  However, I would not return to confirm this."}
{"text":"I am not sure what all the hype is about this place.  The service leaves you starving -- literally.  I was here once when it was packed and once when it was about 50% full.  Both times it took 45-1 hour for the food to come from the kitchen.  The food was alright, but not worth the wait.  While drinks are good, they are certainly follow the restaurant theme of sloooow.  If you are not starving or in a hurry, you can check out the atmosphere and stare at the people next to you while you both endure the down time between drinks, food and the next visit from your server."}
{"text":"My fiancé & I went for Sunday brunch, which can be difficult to get a reservation for. While waiting to be sat, another hostess came over & started complaining about a customer loudly in front of us. She was told to hush but continued to talk about him. It was a really bad first impression. Then another hostess came over & threw the iPad that they use to seat customers onto the stand (hard enough that I expected to see it broken) & the original hostess talked about her under her breath. My fiancé & I felt awkward, it was obvious they were all miserable & didn't really respect the restaurant...& this all happened within our first few minutes there!  We liked the decor, but I couldn't stop staring at the layers of dust above us. I know I probably eat a lot of dust daily, but I really don't want to see thick dust overhead at a nice restaurant. Service was slow, we didn't even get our drinks until we were half way done eating!  The food was great though! I had the French toast & my fiancé had the chicken & waffles...everything we ate was delicious! I just wish the people working were nicer! When you spend over $50 for breakfast food, you expect to be treated well. The nicest person we encountered was the guy running food to tables.  I really can't imagine we would go back anytime soon. Again, kudos to the chef because the food was GREAT...we were just really disappointed with everything else. Also, it turned out that the guy the hostess was complaining about was Kris Letang! Not cool. Let go Pens!"}
{"text":"Meat and Potatoes is a yearly tradition for me and my Steeler friends when we come in from Columbus, OH for a football game. We have been doing it for the past 3 years and unfortunately this visit on 11/13 was a complete disaster. I went to the bar to grab a drink while we waited for our table and my GF went to the bathroom. I hadn't realized that my birthday a few weeks ago was also the date that my ID expired and was denied bar service. As a 30 year old I was a bit annoyed, but didn't voice any displeasure since in reality I was in the wrong and the bartender was just doing her job. When my GF came back from the bathroom I explained the situation to her and told her to go ahead and grab a drink. She attempts to order, but is told that she better not be caught handing me her drink and instead of having her drink made the bartender goes and talks with the manager. Eventually the bartender returns and serves her drink WITHOUT ID'ing her. You would think my younger GF would get her ID checked by the bartender who just made a whole scene about an expired ID. Still, not enough to get us to leave because we want our Rib-Eye. The manager Matt assumed that after all of this we would want a free appetizer, not really, but still a respectable gesture. We are sitting around enjoying our appetizer and I'm sucking on the ice cubes from my GF's EMPTY Bourbon drink when all of a sudden I have the manager rip the glass out of my hand while it's in my mouth. I didn't want to cause any type of scene inside the restaurant and ruin anyone's experience, so I asked Matt if I could have a calm word in the Lobby about what was going on and why I was being harassed. I tried to ask him a couple questions about the situation in the lobby and instead was interrupted and after about 2 minutes was told by Matt \"I don't have time for this, maybe the cops will if you would like them called\" I responded \"that wasn't necessary, but I'm sure they would have loved to hear how his bartender didn't card my GF who was clearly under 30. I wanted to stay because the food is so good, but my friends were just as uncomfortable about the way I was treated as I was. We told our server that we wanted charged for our Appetizers so we could leave her tip and not ruin her night as well. I had made these reservations 3 months in advance and it really sucks that we were treated so horribly. I understand a liquor license is each establishments most valued possession, but I was doing absolutely nothing to try and endanger it. If I had just one piece of advice for management it would be to listen and understand the complete situation instead of assuming and jumping to conclusions. I will never be back or spend a dime at this establishment ever again."}
{"text":"T and I followed the great Yelp reviews to Meat and Potatoes for a Saturday morning brunch. Wow. First of all, I want to move in to this place. If I could choose a restaurant's decor, this would be it. Sexy velvet, white ceramic animals, metal curio cabinets, and a gorgeous white fireplace. Yes please! We made a reservation but wound up getting there about 15 minutes late. (We called to tell them we'd be late.) We expected a bit of a wait but were happy to be seated immediately upon arrival.  While perusing the menu, the waitress brought over big mugs of coffee and described the specials which included a Pastry of the Day. Tip to all brunch restaurants, have a Pastry of the Day. This particular day it was described as a criossant monkey bread with a Krispy Kreme glaze twist. Needless to say, we ordered it. I could have had this and a cup of coffee and walked away satisfied. It was fresh, soft, crispy, sweet. Exactly as described as a Krispy Kreme monkey bread. Holy cow. They should put this on the menu permanently.   T got the huevos ranchero and I got the French toast. The huevos ranchero were great, cheesy and spicy. I found the black beans a touch bland but that was my only complaint. My French toast was amazing and came with bacon almond brittle. Yum! My only complaint was my own doing. I had sweet upon sweet and I should have ordered a savory breakfast since we got the pastry. But that's my own fault. I definitely want to go back the next time we're in Pittsburgh to try other dishes, in particular the chicken and waffles. The owners of this place are opening another spot soon and I'd definitely like to check that out as well!"}
{"text":"With a name like this, it can be pretty obvious what they serve. However they have way more than just Meat & Potatoes. But if you do opt for any of their food involving meat & potatoes, you are in for a treat! On a snowy weekday night it was full but not busy around 9:00pm. I was able to seat immediately at the bar area which I'm sure I took the last available one. This place is not very large, nor is it good for big parties. 2-4 will probably be as big as this place can accommodate for the most part.  The bartender recommended the Wagyu Flat Iron which I got. Both the steak and potatoes were not dry and cooked to my liking. I also got the Root to Berry. It is a pretty fruity cocktail which is what I was craving as I waited for my food. I really wanted to try the bone marrow but all that food probably would have been too much just for me."}
{"text":"Delicioso! Brunch was a very fun upbeat experience. Great libations, fun DJ, long wait to sit at the bar but that's totally fine.  The sticky buns are not to be missed, they were delicious. My husband and I weren't crazy about the breakfast potatoes but that was our only complaint. The strawberry jam is also delightful, we will be back! Ps- their bartenders are amazing."}
{"text":"Meat & Potatoes gets a lot of hype on the Pittsburgh brunch scene, it is good, it's nice, and sometimes it's excellent but not always.   The ambience is great, but this is not the cleanliest place. Last visit I was disappointed at the amount of crumbs I sat in upon getting to the table. I was next to the window sill which had a nice thin layer of dust.   I don't have any complaints about the service, the staff has always been friendly. The restaurant is always busy (good for them!) so I've never gotten the feeling of service that went above and beyond, and some servers are more knowledgable on the menu than others, but they are nice and they get the job done.   If you've never been, I say go! Check it out, and hopefully your visit is a great one."}
{"text":"Went for lunch one day, had the bison sloppy joe, it was delicious. Place has cool vibes. I'll be back to try out dinner."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Food was phenomenal, and the service was great. Wife said her meal was a little bit salty but mine was not. I had the pub burger and she had the pot roast. The portions are huge by the way. Wish it was a bit bigger inside, other than that it was great! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Came here with friends for brunch after hearing really good things for the past couple months. The atmosphere is really chill and modern. Made it easy to get comfortable. We all had their drink of the at and it was absolutely delicious. I then had the Benedict of the day which was a crab cakes one. There are only a couple places in Pittsburgh I'd get crab cakes and Mean and Potatoes was just added to the list! Really great experience here!"}
{"text":"Elegantly casual!! Never had an experience like this before. Seating was awkward but the food was unique and memorable. Must try Meat  and Potatoes !"}
{"text":"As a lifetime card-carrying carnivore, this joint is in my top five for meatastic vittles.  High-end butcher block slaughterhouse meets dragon flame, then served up big, blocky and fancy.  Put it this way:  it's the only place I've even been to that serves bone marrow as \"butter\" for your bread.  Yes.  See me nodding?  Yeah, you do!  Om-nom-nom!!!  Bring your loot, bring your sharp-toothed T-rex date and expect to pick good stuff out of your teeth for hours after.  (*urp!*)  Yeah... it's like that.  #paleobeforeitwascool"}
{"text":"If you like \"meat and potatoes\", this might not be the place for you.  The cocktail selection was outstanding, as was the beer selection.  The food is out there (I went in with this expectation so was not caught off guard).  One of our appetizers was bone marrow---like they bring out a calf leg that has been cut in half and you eat the marrow right out of the bone.  It isn't an appetizer for the faint of heart, but I liked it.  For my main course I had a fantastic leg of lamb, perfectly cooked, with a side of mashed potatoes and something called sweet bread.  I figured it was just that, sweet. bread.  That isn't what sweet bread is.  It's ground up thymus, pancreas, testicles, tongue, etc. of a lamb.  The texture was a huge turn off, but the taste was so-so.  I would not order the sweet bread again.  All in all, the environment was great, a little more upscale with a waitstaff that can play the part.  I was in a suit and did not feel out of place.  My one issue, and I can't say it was the food for certain, but both my girlfriend and I were incredibly sick later that night.  I had a fever, was sweating, and just generally felt terrible---my girlfriend was the opposite, freezing cold, but just as sick.  Like I said, might have had nothing to do with the food; might have been that I had never eaten anything of that nature before and my system didn't know what to think.  Anyway, I will return, just not for the sweetbread.  Cheers, Rob"}
{"text":"A friend and I went to Meat and Potatoes after work on Friday and we made reservations through Open Table for 6:00 PM - easy enough.  We provided our name and got a table right away.   We decided to order several smaller items rather than an entree.  So we got the cheese platter, poutine, short rib flatbread, and lobster mac & cheese.  First we'll deal with the cheese platter - not super impressed.  I prefer my cheeses to be flavorful and sharp...but at least have something to it.  There was only one cheese out of the 3 varieties provided that had something to it...and it was on the mild side.  So nothing too great with the cheese platter.    We ordered the poutine at my suggestion and encouragement b/c I've heard so much about this stuff that I felt like I had to try it.  Maybe I had unrealistic expectations of what fries, gravy, and cheese curds could really do for me, but I felt like they were ok.  I mean potato patch fries with gravy at kennywood would be an adequate comparison...just add some tasteless semi-melted cheese curds and voilà you've got yourself some poutine.  Don't get me wrong, it was good, but I guess I was expecting something AMAZING.    Now on to the good stuff - the short rib flatbread was really really good.  Just the right amount of meat coupled with some flavorful cheese topped with arugula.  Definitely a standout among the dishes.  I highly recommend.  Finally the lobster mac and cheese - delish!  There were visible signs of lobster, not just specs of red - but actual pieces of lobster.  It was sooooo goood!  Another standout dish and maybe the star of the night.    So all in all I highly recommend the short rib flatbread and lobster mac & cheese - those 2 dishes alone will bring me back to Meat & Potatoes!  They are also what made me give this place 4 stars."}
{"text":"I didn't know these guys and Butcher and The Rye were owned by the same people. But when we saw the same exact menu item here: the duck liver pate, we had to get it. It is so so awesome!  We got the fried chicken livers as well. For $7 and a big pile of them. You cannot beat it!  The drinks here are good as well.   But what's best about M&P is their vibe. It's chill and quiet enough to talk. Great lighting, good music and a great bar.   Highly recommend for a date you want to be able to talk to. Assume 30 and up. This isn't the 21+ crowd."}
{"text":"Who would think that pig ears would be good...but you must try the fried pig ear snack.  Crispy and not a bit chewy.  Also to fool the kids, order fried Brussels Sprouts.  Does even look or taste like sprouts!!  Very tasty and not s bit salty.  For the main course, I had the Duck breast.  The breast was tender and juicy.  I just wish there was more veggies.  This dinner was the best of me I had during this trip.  I highly suggest making reservations.  Try to time reservation when many of the theaters in the area are in session, this will beat the show crowd.  The Men's Room is clean and well maintained.  There is 2 stalls and 2 standees."}
{"text":"Poor service and food came out slow. Was in the area for a show and was expecting much much more after all the hoop la etc. I spent over $100 on a group of 4 and it was not worth it."}
{"text":"Excellent brunch. I had the huevos rancheros and it was a decent sized portion with lots of shredded pork and was surprisingly spicy. Someone else had the pork hash which was equally good. There was a DJ and the main restaurant area was hip but very loud and I was happy to be put in a secondary dining room."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat in Pittsburgh.  They have some of the best cocktails, and who doesn't love Meat & Potatoes.  Make your reservations ASAP because they fill rather quickly."}
{"text":"Meat & Potatoes is one of those places that you can't go to regularly...too expensive, but is definitely worth considering when you're up for something a little pricier! I've had both brunch and dinner there and both were great, especially the brunch! They also have a decent beer list, which goes great with..y'know..meat and potatoes."}
{"text":"Always a good time :-) the food is always so good, and not your average, everyday options. Our server was a little flustered and slow, but there were a lot of us and people were coming and going all evening (it was a good bye party for my boss). Regardless, we all had a great time!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. I have never had such fantastic sweet potatoes in my life.  The drinks were excellent.  Just sad you have to book so far in advance to get seated at a decent dinner time but definitely worth it.  This is a must.  Moscow Mules were out of this world.  Ceasar Salad was authentic and lemony.  Staff was very laid back and catered to your needs."}
{"text":"I feel bad for writing this so late, but I was in Pitt during the week U2 was in town...only I was here on business.  I was there five nights, and came to this place 3.  First, I read the reviews before I wrote this.  Anyone giving this place less than a \"4\", probably doesn't understand what a gastropub is.  The wait sometime can be slow, but it is a PUB!  You're supposed to come to hang out and chat with friends and love ones while snacking on a amazing pub food and innovative drinks.  The must haves are the Devils on Horseback (chorizo stuffed dates, wrapped in bacon, topped with a mild chili sauce) or their pot pie, which has ground chicken skin baked into the crust.  All beers are served in tins, but if you know anything about good beers, some of the best craft brews have their beers in cans.  They also have 5 rotating taps.  Finally, for the desert lovers, they usually have two \"pots\", I had the basic pot de creme which was excellent.  I sat at the bar all three times and bartender's are the best.  I let one of them pick my entire meal my first time, and she put together a solid meal.  I hope I get back to Pittsburgh VERY soon."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try meat and potatoes for a long time. It's one of the newer restaurants in Pittsburgh that everyone's been buzzing about.   I tried it out this weekend and I expected to be blown away and I was impressed but not blown away. The seating is tight and the tables are tiny. It's hard not to hear your neighbors entire conversation.   We ordered the brisket Mac and cheese and mussels to start. The brisket was great the Mac and cheese not so much.  The mussels were really great! We got them in the Thai curry broth which was very tasty. We also shared the ribeye for 2. It's huge more like enough for 4. I wasn't a fan of the bone marrow but I can see how it can be appealing to some. (My dog really loved it!) The steak and potatoes were good."}
{"text":"You know of the story where a vegetarian walks into a restaurant called MEAT and Potatoes expecting to NOT eat potatoes? Yeah, me neither. But it happened when I had a couple people visit from out of town and Butcher and the Rye was sold out (not that that name is any more appetizing, ha!). So yeah. They wanted to go to a \"nice\" restaurant and the three $$$ seemed to fit the bill.   I ordered fried brussels and mushroom flatbread - mission accomplished! While it was a little sad to make a tiny dent in the bill while actually paying for my carnivore visitors ordering the likes of Wagyu Flat Iron, I was happy to see them satisfied with their meals. It helped that the service was impeccable and the ambience was not as stuffy as some other places that take themselves even more seriously.   While I won't be returning anytime soon, you should check the place out. I imagine that if you and/or your friends like the name (in a non-metaphorical sense) and enjoy good service, it's a pretty good place to be on a weeknight (can't speak for the weekend scene)."}
{"text":"Service was slow. We didn't see the waiter very often. Don't get the duck. It was very good, but there wasn't much of it. I'd have been better off with a cheeseburger."}
{"text":"Overall a nice restaurant with a fun atmosphere. The service was excellent along with a good beer list and drink selection. We had fried pickles and pig ears for apps. Pickles came out right from the fryer, runner did a good job of warning us which was much appreciate. Both were good but the pickles were definitely the tables favorite. My wife ordered the pork chop and I had the wagyu flat iron, both were good but I felt both lacked some seasoning specifically salt. Another member of the party had the pasta with the pork shoulder, probably the best dish at the table. Overall would possibly go back but for the most part the food tasted average to me for above average prices."}
{"text":"Had dinner for 4 on a Saturday night. Clearly busy, but that is to be expected for a quality establishment. Drinks were spot on and the staff was great. My girlfriend and I split the meat and potatoes for 2... definitely a fantastic meal. It can become pricy, but you absolutely get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Oh my, the cocktails!!  Hold up, Pittsburgh. How lucky are you to have Meat & Potatoes? VERY lucky, I tell you.  Strangely enough I only came here for cocktails - but got numerous whiffs of the nearby plates of fellow diners. While I can't comment first hand on the plates, dear god, if they tasted anything like they smelled (or looked!) you're in really good shape.  Now onto what I did experience: The hand-crafted, creative, top-quality cocktails made by extremely knowledgeable bartenders who care about the craft itself.  If you like spicy drinks, try the El Segundo immediately. Tequila, yellow chartreuse, pineapple, cilantro and the real kicker, jalapeno. It was perfect.   Meanwhile, if something doesn't tickle your fancy on the menu, ask your bartender! My counterpart and I had a blast being the \"test drinkers\" for the staff!  Great, great, great place!"}
{"text":"I went to Brunch at Meat and Potatoes on Saturday morning with my girlfriend and loved it! The service was great, the food was delicious and overall we both had a great experience. One helpful hint before going to M&P would be to try and do a reservation, just to make sure you can get a table as it seemed like a hot spot for Brunch (and have heard it gets packed in general). Here is a my full breakdown of M&P:  Service (5 out of 5): As states, the service was great! The server was very nice and really helpful as this was our first time at M&P. She was an excellent server overall (I was a server at one point and know how hard it can be sometimes).   Décor (5 out of 5): I really enjoyed the décor of M&P and loved the overall atmosphere of the place. Although it was a bit warm for me when I went, I really like that they have an outdoor patio for those who wish to eat outside.   Food (5 out of 5): For brunch, I had the salmon flat bread and my girlfriend had their French Toast. I found the Salmon flat bread to be the perfect amount of food and to be very flavorful! I had some of my girlfriend's French toast and it was certainly a treat! The French toast was cooked perfectly and was the perfect amount of sweet. I would vote for the Salmon flat bread over the French Toast only b/c the French Toast is a lot of food and can be very filling (still worth it to try it though if you are starving or want to split something).   On a side note, M&P also had a Bloody Mary bar. Neither of us had a Bloody Mary, but were sitting next to it. Everything that was being made looked good, if you are into Bloody Mary's."}
{"text":"I was bound to love Meat & Potatoes, due mostly to my unstoppable love of both meat and potatoes. Beyond that, the spot is a great place for drinks, brunch, or dinner.   Every time I visit, I am floored by how fairly the place is priced. Sure, you can go with a $50 steak, but there are also reasonably priced delicious burgers, tacos, or a breakfast sandwich at brunch. There's an adventurous element to the menu (I ate fried chicken livers last meal there!) dressed down as comfortable pub fare. One of the most popular menu items is the bone marrow.   The decor is hip and fun, but when I go I don't feel like I need to starve myself the next few days to make up for breaking the bank. The place is always packed, don't plan on going there before a show if you don't have a reservation. Actually, just don't plan on going unless you have a reservation--I went on a Monday at 8:30pm and it was still crowded.   So why not 5/5 stars? Every time I've visited Meat & Potatoes, I've had some issue at the hostess station. They consistently seat you at least 15 minutes late for reservations, and they tried to seat me outside last November (which would've been perfect had I been trying to catch pneumonia). I wouldn't downgrade if this was a single occurrence, but every time I go, there is some sort of confusion upfront. Midway through my meal, I almost always forget because the food is so delicious."}
{"text":"Meat and potatoes, it's a neat little spot with great ambience. For the price, I think it's a little over price for the food. It was great food but it's like any other burger joint I've been to. I got the skirt steak taco, it was very chewy. I was expecting to be able to bit into my taco and have an ease to chew instead of cutting it. My fiancé got the burger, it was tasty. Service was great, she gave us her opinion of her favorite dishes. Fries were great. I want to give this place a 3.5 stars, but 4 will have to do."}
{"text":"No question M&P has a great atmosphere.  Always high energy which can elevate and otherwise mediocre experience.  Otherwise the place is just OK.  Its fine.  Its just not great for any other reason.  Craft cocktails are small and overpriced.  Food is good but nothing noteworthy or really that memorable.  I agree with other reviews that its just a bit overrated.  There seems to be a slightly inflated sense of this place emanating from the staff.  Many, many other options downtown now.  I would say go if the opportunity presents itself but by no means wait on line for an hour to get in."}
{"text":"Fantabulous!!!  The food by far was 5 stars.  I had the Short Rib flat bread and the smoked wings.  Both were great, but the smoked wings were probably the best wings I've ever had in my life.  Also, had a bite of the mushroom burger and wow!  Phenomenal flavor.  Definitely one of the best burgers I've ever had.    However, service could be improved.  We came for a reservation at 845 and we were not seated until 9:15.  Needless to say, we were starving!  After the long wait, our server and the table got off to a good start, but after she came back to take our orders, she seemed so annoyed to be doing her job.  I don't know if something happened in the back, but I couldn't discern anything my party did to make her so annoyed.  It ended up that we felt we had to be overly polite in order not to piss her off.  Talk about annoying!    Nonetheless, I can't wait to be back.  Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Love the food and atmosphere! Great place to relax with friends and a good bottle of Cabernet. I'll be back whenever I'm in town :)"}
{"text":"Didn't get a chance to eat there...the hostess was rude and talked about reservations 3 months in advance, even though they had an FOP Conference support sign in the window."}
{"text":"This place is just fantastic -  food and atmosphere. Get the bone marrow, you will NOT be sorry. The only thing I would wish to do is make it bit less noisy and crowded. Cocktails first-rate."}
{"text":"The best burger I have ever had. The ribeye STK burger is on point!  Please go get one ASAP, it was well worth it."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Pub Burger & the buttermilk battered Fried Chicken Livers.  It was crowded on Saturday before Steelers game so service was pretty slow, but food was worth the wait."}
{"text":"I've lived in Pittsburgh for 3 years and kept this restaurant in the back of my mind to try one day and I finally got the chance; unfortunately it let me down. I'll list the positive first: good food. It is good,but not great and for what they charge, it should be great. I ordered the Kobe beef with a sweet and savory sauce with fingerling potatoes. The sauce needed to be mixed together and that was not explained in the menu or from the waitress (more in that in a bit) so my first couple bites were actually disappointing. My wife tried a salad, which was good but not memorable. I was also disappointed with the lackluster beer list and the decor. It's designed to look old but with the Christmas pine cones, it looked 'dirty old' and was not appetizing. Also, seating was uncomfortably tight. I sat too close to people on either side with wait staff bumping our table while standing too close to take orders. Lastly, on the decor, they don't have their own bathrooms! You need to use the theater. I was recently in a restaurant in Dallas that was awarded one of the top 5 bathrooms in Dallas. I didn't know there was someone keeping a list but if they went here, they would be very disappointed. Finally I wasn't impressed by the staff. The people greeting didn't seem happy to be there and our waitress didn't explain anything on the menu and seemed not to know about it. When my wife asked about the speciality salad, she shrugged and said\"I don't know; I don't like warm salads.\" When I asked for a recommendation, she merely told me the top 4 entry items were most popular. I feel the only reason this restaurant is popular is: A: it's near the theater and B: Pittsburgh doesn't have too many places to compete for fine dining... yet."}
{"text":"Two of my friends told me to go here while I am in Pittsburgh so I knew I had to stop by.  I was there for a work trip so I just snagged a seat at the bar.   I was told I had to get the brussel sprouts and after seeing they were fried with Parmesan cheese I knew I had to get it.  I was deciding between the fried chicken liver and fried pig ears, I asked the bartender and he said oo yeah tough choice but I would go with the pig ears so I ordered that.  Yes the brussel sprouts were so good and it is a pretty big portion.  If you don't like brussel sprouts, this will change your mind.  I know the sound of fried pig ears sounds weird but it is just meat and just chewy and oh my was this good!  It had a sweet chili sauce with it and pickled vegetables inside.  I was so happy I ordered that and it was so different.  I would definitely recommend that dish.   Looking at everyone's dishes around me everything looked so good and the bartenders were very attentive and super nice.  I would recommend this place to anyone visiting Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Very good food, excellent drinks (pricey but worth every penny), and casual classy ambience. Beautifully appointed all around.  Overall a very positive experience.  Only downside was that it's very cramped in the seating area - if you have loud, nosey, or annoying neighbors, you are in for a bad experience.  Fortunately, we had none of those - in fact, our neighbors were very friendly & pleasant to chat with - so we had a great time.  It's a bit of a gamble, though."}
{"text":"Amazing Food.  I am a big fan of this place.  They also have awesome beer glasses.  I recommend buying one!"}
{"text":"I ordered fried pickles as an appetizer and Pub Burger as the main dish and both were delicious. Pub Burger was $14 dollars but well worth it. The burger was large, well seasoned, juicy (not soggy), and flavorful. Came with a side of fries which were crispy with just the right amount of salt. The wait for the food wasn't bad considering how many people were at the restaurant. It took maybe around 20 min from the time we ordered our food to the time we received it. We were also served appetizers in that time frame which made the wait more bearable."}
{"text":"Rather than partaking in the giant place of dinosaur meat that is the \"Meat & Potatoes for Two\" - their signature dish - (seriously, though, it was a terrifying-looking impressive plate of meat), we chose the small-plates route through Meat & Potatoes.   The cocktail and wine list got us started off right, and we were just barely able to squeeze down the following: Fried pickles - clearly, if you know me, I will never NOT get the fried pickles Fried brussels sprouts - again, never say no. They maybe had a little bit too much cheese, but the lemon aioli was on point Fried chicken livers - we kinda overdid it on the fried snacks, but it was such a rare treat Bone marrow - just had to try this, and the portion of 3 large bones did not disappoint Wild mushroom risotto - was maybe a little heavy on the truffle, but the mushrooms were super tasty Special Bahn Mi tacos - some beautiful cuts of meat in a tasty sauce with fresh veggies on a pretty big taco  We arrived around 7, and by the time we left, the place was really filling up, which made the dance club soundtrack finally make sense. Our server kept the drinks coming and the courses flowing."}
{"text":"Brunch is a solid 5, dinner is a 4, so average 4.5 and a traditional 'round down' on yelp to a 4.  Dinner can be on the saltier side. Breakfast has so many unique and delicious options, I haven't made my way though all of them but everything I've had has been delicious."}
{"text":"While I was in town, I wanted see what all the hype was about - and it definitely was worth it!  Meat & Potatoes is a must on your list for any night out.   I headed out with a few of my gal pals, and we had so much fun. The food was amazing, the drinks were fantastic. I'm always a little weary about drinking beer out of a can, but it was okay with the atmosphere.  The Fried Pickles were spectacular as was the Kobe Corn Dog - it just sounds intriguing, right?  The Mac 'n Cheese was excellent too - hello, chorizo!  My only complaint was that we had reservations, and we had to wait for another 30 minutes and there were open tables. Not sure what was going on...but worth the wait.   Overall, awesome evening in my book."}
{"text":"By far the best restaurants in the 'burgh! You can't go wrong with anything on the menu, and the drinks are awesome. Try the bloody mary bar at brunch!"}
{"text":"We had a great dinner and food lives up to the local hype.  Menu is varied and unique.  Only down side is that my Martini was sub par and no Grey Goose behind the bar.    I'll go back...simply drink beer the next visit."}
{"text":"One of Richard DeShantz's places, so you know the food is probably going to be good.  They also do very good cocktails   my favorite Meat and Potatoes memory was sitting outside during the Furry Convention and watching folks in full fur suits walk up and down the street.  Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I think this restaurant is over hyped. They aren't as good as they think they are (meaning an attitude adjustment by their staff may also be in order). Our group had a variety of foods including the chicken and waffles, the burger, the Mac and cheese (no flavor), Brussels sprouts (meh), and the fried chicken sandwich. Nothing was a stand out. It's not on my list for a return visit."}
{"text":"Perfect atmosphere....probably because there aren't TVs....which can be good or bad (on Steeler Sunday).  Amazing bar, creative cocktails, over the top Bloody Marys/Bloody Mary bar on the weekends. Very trendy, interesting menu choices. I tend to have a difficult time choosing something that sounds absolutely delicious, but did enjoy the sunday brunch and burger. A little pricey but very upscale, first class, quality ingredients..which is very evident."}
{"text":"Great hole-in-the-wall pub in downtown Pittsburgh's theater or \"entertainment\" district. We ordered only off the appetizers menu and both were absolutely astonishingly good the onion rings and brussels sprouts. Based on how far on opposite ends of the health spectrum these were I can tell Meat & Potatoes puts plenty of effort into their food.  They do have a full bar, as they should, with friendly bar tending service that I haven't seen that often around the Steel City. These people know their craft and love doing it.  Next time I'm in Pitt I will definitely swing by here again!"}
{"text":"The husband and I went to meat & potatoes before seeing Puscifer downtown.  We had a great time!  5 stars for awesome food AND service.  We made a reservation, and when you do that, they ask if you're going to an event and what time it starts--so they can have you out on time.  We started off with two cocktails (I got an Old Canadian and he got a black pepper manhattan.)  I was looking around at the online menu before we left for dinner, and much to my disappointment the Old Canadian was no longer on the menu at the restaurant.  However, the waitress checked and had the bartender make one for me anyway! Woohoo! It was delicious maple-y whiskey goodness. :)  We also shared poutine (hey, I'm an Old Canadian, remember??) and i was great.  Not at ALL like the fast food nacho cheese fries I remember having in Quebec as a little kid...but in a good way.  Nice, crispy fries with mushroomy gravy and real cheese.  Bonus!  Husband got a burger (more mushrooms) and I got fish tacos, which were spicy, cilantro-y, and amazing.  Even though he is a total carnivore, he said he'd order them next time.  We loved the hip, dark atmosphere--it honestly reminded us a little of home (Omaha).  We will definitely walk down here after dinner in the summer a few times just to get a drink at the bar, and it will probably become a regular date night spot for us as well.  I don't know why we waited so long to try it!!"}
{"text":"I dined here this past weekend as part of a birthday celebration.  Upon entering the restaurant we were led through the main portion and into a backroom.  While the backroom was nice for talking to all members of the party, the decor was extremely plain and did not match the rest of the restaurant.  For dinner I started out by ordering the poutine as an appetizer.  This was the first time that I had ever had poutine in Pittsburgh and it was a good resemblance to the popular Canadian dish.  I was also lucky enough to taste some of the tartar which came on top of bone marrow.  Both of the appetizers that I had were very good and I was happy to have ordered them.  My entree was the duck breast which came on top of mashed sweet potatoes and red cabbage which was topped with a nice sauce and brussels sprouts with bacon.  The duck was cooked perfectly and I even enjoyed the potatoes which was odd since I am not normally a sweet potato fan.  I also had the pleasure of trying both the bass/papperdelle dish and the three pigs.  Each was excellent!  The bottom line for me is that my dinner here was the best dinner that I have had in a long time.  With that being said I am really looking forward to coming back and hope that it is in the near future!"}
{"text":"Went here for my anniversary. The atmosphere wasn't exactly ideal for me. I felt that it was far too crowded and they didn't have an adequate amount of staff to take care of the amount of people in the place. However, the food was delicious and making a reservation was easy and we didn't have to wait long for our table to be ready."}
{"text":"Extremely well prepared and delicious. Starting with the bone marrow was absolutely devine. It is not the traditional marrow. They service it right out of the bone with various toppings to boot. The marrow tastes like putting a meat flavored butter on an already buttered toast. It almost tastes like pork belly but this one just melts on the bread. Next I moved to the wagu flat iron. The only reason for the 4 and not the 5 is the timing. I was not quite done enjoining the marrow and the meat was getting cold. Apart from that the steak was very tender and delicious. Warning that the carrot salad that comes with the steak is really tasty but spicy so be cautious. I would say it is on the medium side of spiciness but unexpected."}
{"text":"I was hoping for something better after reading all of the great reviews. I think that maybe I just didn't like the place, but I could see that many would. You are basically sitting next to another couple (some people don't mind this). The decor is cool though, modern take on Victorian era/whiskey bar...nice outdoor seating area..With a name like Meat and Potatoes I was expecting simple dishes done well comprised of...Meat and Potatoes! I ordered the chicken and Yukon gold potatoes..very one note taste, even though the chicken came with olives, potatoes, onions, fennel...all the extras didn't help dish. BF had the pot roast, which wasn't that good..again, very one note taste and bottled gravy taste. Mashed potatoes were just eh, ok at best.........the lobster mac and cheese, AGAIN one note taste, just a heavy cheese sauce (Velveeta like), way too much sauce to noodle ratio...wasn't bad, but not what I would hope for from this place. Even my cocktail tasted like it was made from a mix.. I ordered the peanut butter/banana cake...but it was just stale cake crumbles in a mason jar with peanut butter and cool whip-like substance on it...not that good. I dunno, maybe I'd give it another go.....Not horrible, but not that great either."}
{"text":"Wow what a piece of meat and great meal . Delicious!! Worth it  for any occasion. Be sure to make a reservation."}
{"text":"Jason is a fabulous waiter!  Without him it would have been 2 stars.  Walked in, as a tourist, \"What can I help you with?\"  Not a particularily friendly greeting at the door. I walked into a restaurant, let's see....eating maybe? Food nice.  Cobb Salad was delicious, styled up, smallish portion.  Nice atmosphere.  Overall worth a try."}
{"text":"Always great.  Was surprised that they ran out of the big steak on a Sunday night.   Service is always great and the bone marrow is off the charts.  Chicken livers are also a favorite.   I did notice that they have now made the steak more ala carte, not that you needed the potatoes but the sauce was nice.  My kids love it and it's always on our list when we visit."}
{"text":"Meat AND potatoes!!! Omg, so good! I love this place. You really won't be disappointed and it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"I made my reservation for Meat and Potatoes a couple months in advance and they were more than accommodating when I had called two additional times to make it larger. So, I was really happy with their customer service from the get go.   We arrived 15 minutes before our 10:30 pm reservation and were seated exactly on time. I was hoping that since was later in the evening that we'd get seated earlier, but the place was actually still very packed.   The hostess seated us at a table with very plush, tufted dining chairs and a beautiful wood table. (I immediately had dining room envy.) The menu gave you choices, but it wasn't overwhelming. However, there were so many different things that we wanted to try for starters, but we settled on the Mac and Cheese, Fried Taters, and the Smoked Buffalo Wings. My plan was to focus on the Smoked Buffalo wings and the fries, due to the breakup that my digestion system had with lactose a few years ago. For my main dish, I ordered the Waygu Flatiron Steak because, I mean, this place was probably named \"Meat and Potatoes\" for a reason.   And, I soon discovered what that reason was....   ::Cue Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 21 in C Major::   A culinary masterpiece sans fanfare and haute cuisine presentation descended upon us. The appetizers arrived in beautiful, steaming piles on cast iron dishes. Even though I was hungry,  I couldn't help but wonder how we'd even finish half of it.  That worry was quickly erased. I began shoveling french fries into my mouth. And, after I saw my sister break the crust on the steaming pile of corkscrew noodles drenched in creamy cheesiness, the plans to forgo the Mac and Cheese were quickly forgotten.   Everything was OUT OF CONTROL good. The wings were an amazing ratio of saucy to crispy. And, there was a perfect smokiness to the wing sauce. I would venture to say that they were the best that I have ever had. The mac and cheese was uniquely divine and set a new standard for the cheese pasta dish. The fries were perfect crisp and seasoned.  Potatoes were never done better justice.   When the waiters came back for our plates, there were only bones and emptiness left in this post apocalyptic foodie wasteland. We, the Annihilators, were full, happy, and ready to tackle the next course.   The Waygu Flatiron was perfectly marbled and seasoned, served with heirloom tomatoes, pickled jimaca, and wasabi mashed potatoes. The steak has become what I would want for my last meal on Earth. The mashed potatoes weren't my favorite. The consistency was a bit stiff and the wasabi was off putting when contrasted with the other flavors in the dish.   We were too gorged to even consider dessert, but we did get the pumpkin cheesecake to go. It is served a cute little mason jar with a few raspberries on top. (I hate raspberries, but we'll forgive them this one offense.) This dessert was light and delicious. And, should probably be incorporated into my Thanksgiving menu. I'm just sayin'.  Richard DeShantz, you make gourmand dreams come true."}
{"text":"Honestly...really tasty, definitely a place you must check out once, but not a place that can be your regular jazz. Portions are humongous!"}
{"text":"We had visited another restaurant owned by the same group previously, and loved it, so we had high hopes for this place to. Most of the food was pretty tasty and service was attentive. We started with cocktails and crispy pork ears served with quick pickles. The ears were nice and crunchy - more like crispy bacon than some other places I've tried them. We also had the poutine which much like American poutine in general does hold up to its Canadian counterpart. But if you haven't had it in Canada, this one was okay. My one compliant is the cheese curds - there isn't enough and their consistency is such that they don't really melt. I had the buffalo two ways - buffalo steak served with buffalo sweet breads. The steak was yummy and fairly light. I usually like sweet breads, but these were maybe too big because they seemed a little too glandular for me to stomach. Plus I wasn't a fan of the buffalo sauce. If you like buffalo wings, you might enjoy this spin. We also had the bone in steak served with twice baked potatoes. It was a nice steak and a good representation for a restaurant of the same name."}
{"text":"After three years of making reservations, and canceling (sorry) at the last minute, I FINALLY MADE IT TO MEAT AND POTATOES. finally.   And I must say, it's kinda worth the wait. The seats are so comfy, the table is roomy, and the beer is cold. And, the food is amazing.   Came in for an early reservation, at 5:30. Was sat immediately, in the well decorated dining room. Ordered a Victory \"Summer Love\", due to Nicki's (our AWESOME server) suggestion. Before i had half of my beer gone, my order of Bone Marrow was steaming on my table. This. Stuff. Is. Amazing. The kid that brought my food told me how the breakdown went, as I was popping my marrow cherry. He described the marrow at \"meat butter\". There are no better words. Bread, sea salt, herbs, capers and pickled onions accompany the marrow, but you don't even really need them! Still, amazing with.   My entree came next, the Duck. I originally was super excited about the duck, but my first bite of pickled cauliflower turned me off. I chugged a little more of my beer, and went to work on the duck. It was perfection. They can keep the pickled cauliflower next time.    Dessert was a red velvet gob cookie, I love red velvet, but this was a little weird and hard to eat. But hey, everything else was amazing, so I'm not gonna complain!!  Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"I ordered the collard greens as an ap. They were the best I have ever had. I had the pot roast as mc. I could not stop ooohing and ahhhing, literally. The gravy was so savory, the mashed so awesome with it, the vegies so perfect, I could not finish all the chuck, which was tender and tasty. Sever was very competent, nice ambiance."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner and really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I had brunch here today and really enjoyed it. The menu is large and the food was delicious. I tried the brisket hash which had perfectly cooked poached eggs and tender and fatty (but not too fatty) brisket. I also opted for the Bloody Mary bar which was a nice set up for you to craft anything you wanted including lots of cured meat toppers. Someone at our table got the chicken and waffles and it literally had almost a whole chicken on top - way too much food and really unnecessary although e said the flavor was good. I did think that the menu items were all very heavy so are a splurge - there was not a vegetable to be found on the menu. I also felt the chairs were too low for the table. But overall a solid dining option in downtown Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Came here for an early dinner. Happy hr. drinks wete delicious. I had the smoked meatloaf. Deeeeelicious! It was huge! I'll definitely come back. Service at the bar is exceptional! All the dishes that I saw coming out looked very appetizing."}
{"text":"I used the Yelp \"seat me\" function to make a reservation and was very pleased with the entire process. My mom and I came here on a Monday night before a show and truly enjoyed our experience at Meat and Potatoes.  This was my first time here for dinner (I've had brunch here twice) and I was excited for the opportunity since it is so busy here and you need reservations typically to get a table. We started off with drinks and I enjoyed a Duke of Earl, which is an Earl grey infused tanqueray.  I am not much of a cocktail person but I enjoyed it, not too sweet nor too bitter.  We shared an appetizer of Devils on Horseback, which is a delicious fig stuffed with cheese and wrapped in bacon.  There were three, so we each had one and half and likely would have eaten more. We decided to share our entrees and ordered the scallops and a flatbread with pulled pork.  The scallops were cooked perfectly and served with quinua.  Loved it.  The flatbread was just 'meh'. Nothing exciting there. We enjoyed our visit to Meat and Potatoes and thought the staff were all friendly and attentive.  Our server, Crystal, was friendly and very informative.  She knew we were going to a show and made sure our dinners were timed perfectly.   I thought the price was reasonable for the level of service and quality of food."}
{"text":"Wow. One of the best steaks ever. A 34 oz bone-in Ribeye. A steak of all steaks. Tender. Perfectly cooked medium rare. And it came with delicious mushrooms, bone marrow and crispy steak fries. Everything was well-seasoned. A meal fit for a king."}
{"text":"We came to Pittsburgh from Cleveland for our one year wedding anniversary and our first stop was Meat and Potatoes for brunch. Read good reviews and had high hopes and they did not disappoint. Literally some of the best brunch food my husband and I have had and we're big brunch fans. The most impressive part was the perfectly poached egg on my hash, which is really hard to find. Our server was lovely, the Bloody Mary bar well stocked and we could not have been more satisfied. This is officially our Pittsburgh brunch spot."}
{"text":"I'm in town for a Siim conference and was looking for a place for dinner. I read the reviews on yelp and thought I have to try this place. Thank you Yelpers this place has delicious food and drinks. If your in town you must try this place."}
{"text":"My husband and I were very behind in trying Meat and Potatoes (so behind actually that we tried its newer sister restaurant Butcher and the Rye first), and we finally checked it out tonight before our Alton Brown Live show at the Benedum.  I had heard over and over again, particularly when Meat and Potatoes first opened, that the staff was underwhelming. Though they exceeded my extremely low expectations, I must admit that this restaurant receives 4 stars (and not 5) from me because of the staff that I encountered. The best analogy for me is to think of the sales associates (or should I say models) at Abercrombie. They will ring up your purchase, but they will not do it with a smile or go the extra mile. However, when I'm paying nearly $100 for a meal for two (drinks, appetizer, entrees, dessert, and tip), I expect my waiter to have a better personality than an A&F employee.  The second, but more minor, reason for my 4 star review is the seating. Though the restaurant is beautiful aesthetically, the made-for-2-people bench seat with accompanying miniature round table and chair is very teeny. This compact seating reminds me of restaurants in New York City and is not something that I want to experience in Pittsburgh. Plus, we were sitting a bit too close to a drunk woman ranting loudly to the strangers sitting immediately next to her about her ex-husband and his numerous infidelities and addiction issues.  However, despite these few flaws, I had a great dinner. We started with the Wild Mushroom Risotto appetizer. It was warm and rich and full of flavor. I would definitely order this dish again, though I do believe that it had a tad too much salt. For our main course, my husband ordered the Pot Roast, while I went with the Hudson Valley Duck Breast. The two bites of Pot Roast that I tried were very pleasing. The dish was homey and flavorful and appeared to be a great portion size. Overall, I enjoyed the Hudson Valley Duck Breast but did think that it had some opportunities for improvement. The little dandelion green salad on the plate seemed a bit unnecessary. However, it was descent tasting, particularly the pickled onions on top.  The sauerkraut pierogies on the dish were a major disappointment to me. They tasted pretty one-note and could have used some sort of sour cream sauce on top to improve the flavor. However, the star of the dish - the pastrami crusted duck - was perfection! The duck was cooked rare/medium rare (just the way that I like it) and perfectly seasoned. By the end of the meal, I was too full to finish and felt absolutely devastated to leave two slices of duck sitting on my plate.  We had allowed two hours for dinner before our show, so since we were finished in only 45 minutes, we decided to order a dessert. Though I'm sure the desserts change frequently, I do wish that the restaurant would print a small menu with the options. I had a tough time remembering all the options when the waiter listed them for me and also couldn't see the distant dessert sign on the wall. We selected the Baked Chocolate Mousse that was out-of-this-world delicious. I have to say that it was my favorite item of the evening, with the duck in a very close second.  Though I may have sounded critical throughout this review, especially since having the meal-of-my-life at Butcher and the Rye just a couple weeks ago, I do have to say that I enjoyed my first Meat and Potatoes experience, and it definitely won't be my last."}
{"text":"Awesome!  This place has really cool cocktails made by really great bartenders.  The staff is friendly and engaging.  We had the smoked wings which were great!  We also had the pub burger and the hot chicken sandwich and they were both great!  It's a really great place to go to when you are in Pittsburgh and/or going to a show nearby.  I need to come back to try more."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Good service. Fun drinks. Great atmosphere! Our steak for two was impressive, but a lot of the meat was fatty to the point it wasn't edible, but great to take home to the dog!"}
{"text":"I went with my boyfriend and another couple for brunch recently. Bloody mary bar was awesome (there were so many options for toppings), you are able to pick your liquor and then go to the bar and add whatever you would like which makes it fun. The food was great and our table had a great view and was spacious. The server seemed to be either hungover or that he did not want to be there. Other than the service, everything was amazing and we will be back!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I decided to try the highly talked about brunch and Bloody Mary bar this morning for my birthday. We had made a reservation, so we were seated immediately. I ordered a Bloody Mary and the Benedict of the day, my fiancé ordered a Bloody Mary and the huevos rancheros. About 10 minutes later we saw our food come out, but they tried to give it to another table. 5 minutes later, they finally brought it to us. We had yet to receive our glasses to take to the Bloody Mary bar, so we had to ask again (we were seated by the bar and could see our glasses full of vodka and ice just sitting there melting). I tried my food before heading to the bar and it was ice cold. I hate complaining, but it was inedible. They took it back and continued to apologize profusely. Once I got my food back, my fiancé was finished with his (I told him to keep eating so his wouldn't get cold). It would have been nice to have been able to eat together. They didn't even take anything off of the bill.   It is upsetting because we were looking forward to coming here and even saved it for a special occasion, but the service wasn't great and my food was cold and they didn't do anything about it but apologize.   It is an expensive place to not have a perfect experience. Because of that I don't know if we will ever be back."}
{"text":"A favorable vegetarian review of Meat and Potatoes? They must be doing something right!  We had reservations for 16 for dinner before the symphony.  We were split up into 2 tables which was fine.  There was a private room by the kitchen for bigger parties.  The place was packed at 6PM on a Saturday night.  We ordered drinks-I had the Ronaldo, which featured house made raspberry vodka. It was as sweet and delicious as I thought it would be.    As for the menu, there are quite a few vegetarian sides and appetizers, so we got the mushroom flatbread which was amazing.  Fresh argula and shaved parmesan really completed the dish.  For dinner, we ordered the only vegetarian entree, which was the pumpkin ravioli.  For me, I don't mind having few choices when I go out to eat-I usually find the smaller the menu the better the dishes are.  I wasn't disappointed with this dish.  The raviolis were stuffed with pumpkin in a creamy sauce that was light and flavorful.  I only wish there were more-it was that good!  I'm not a huge dessert eater so we didn't even look at the menu.  I took one star off for the service.  When our flatbread came out we weren't given plates and couldn't flag our waiter down for them.  He also never checked to see if we wanted to order another round of drinks-another waiter came by and helped us instead.  Other than that, it was a great meal."}
{"text":"more like 3.5.  We had brunch on Saturday. Reservations for 10:30am, when they open, and highly recommended. There was already a line in the lobby, even on a cold Saturday morning.  Pleasantly surprised by the their ability to change the offerings. We had two vegetarians in the group (at Meat and Potatoes? I know..), but it was no issue. They did the huevos rancheros sans the pork and it was really good. Also had the banana waffles which disappeared quickly. Very solid drip coffee, and a wild Bloody Mary bar. Music was bit loud for a Saturday morning. Very solid offering."}
{"text":"Has it really been almost 3 years since my first review of Meat & Potatoes? Well, I think it's about time I author a new review, especially since I've been there a number of times since. Most recently, I had the opportunity to have dinner with several other Yelpers. What I've always loved about this restaurant is its proximity to so many fun and interesting things in downtown Pittsburgh, especially the theater district. In addition, the interior decor and ambiance resonates with the types of restaurants I enjoy going out to for dinner. It's cozy, relaxing, and sexy. Prior to my most recent dinner adventure at MP, I last dined here in December 2014 for my birthday, and before that sometime during the summer of 2014. To be quite frank, I immediately noticed that the menu hasn't really changed much over the last 6-8 months (give or take). I mean, don't get me wrong, the salmon and hangar steak are delish (really, really delish), but I've become bored looking at them on the menu. Give us something new and exciting, MP! Even some of the drinks have been on the menu for a lengthy period of time. We all know your bartenders are extremely creative, so let's see some new items hit the menu. OK, I'll step off my stool now. On the bright side, the food and service were really great. The five of us shared their bone marrow appetizer and a cheese plate. For a drink, I chose their old fashioned cocktail. Having recently stopped into The Commoner and ordering their old fashioned, I much prefer the MP version. For my entree, I ordered the hangar steak. I know, I know. I just complained that the hangar steak has been on the menu for ummm ever, but it is really good and was cooked to a perfect medium rare. I enjoyed my meal, I loved every moment of it and really wanted to savor some dessert, but just didn't have the room. Of course I'll keep dining at MP, but would love (really love) to sit down, open a menu and see some newer items listed."}
{"text":"I've eaten ant Meat and Potatoes before but it was before I really started writing reviews consistently. I stopped in the other night with a coworker and had some appetizers at the bar. Everything we had was delicious! We ordered some devils on horseback, which I actually have never had before, and they were perfect! The dates were stuffed with chorizo and I was really surprised that there were not greasy in the slightest. We also got and order of brussel sprouts and smoked wings, both of which were satisfying. Knowing how amazing the tartare is at Butcher, I had to try it out at M&P. I really did like it. However, it may have been my least favorite of the appetizers. The Asian inspiration was not for me. i felt like I was eating a tuna tartare instead of my beloved steak! While I love both of them, it isn't a love that is equal by any means. The drinks were good and the bartenders were very impressive with how attentive they were! I was extremely happy overall with out meal."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch on Sunday morning. Definitely need to make a reservation before coming as it was jam packed. I ordered the Nashville hot chicken and waffles and they we're amazing. 4-5 pieces of crispy fried chicken over a delicious waffle with hot sauce and maple syrup. One of the best renditions of this I've ever had. Wife had blueberry and lemon pancakes and she loved every bite. They also have one of the best Bloody Mary bars in town. We will be back in the future to try out other options that they have."}
{"text":"The words Brunch and Meat & Potatoes go hand-in-hand.  Think you'll stop in on a Sunday morning and just \"grab a seat\"? Think again! You better call well in advance for those seats and have a res, and you'll be glad you did.  I've only ever been to M&P for brunch, but have been there several times. Each time I've ended up getting one of the specials as my meal, and I've never been disappointed, but have enjoyed some more than others. The cinnamon bun-fantastic and sticky! The Benedict special-it rotates and you should always get it!  Now for the drinks. The coffee is always hot and almost constantly refilled by their staff who are very attentive. Now there is also a magnificent Bloody Mary bar as well. This thing has everything and more that you could ever hope for your Bloody Mary--bacon, shrimp, celery, and...grape leaves! It's basically a meal in itself.  If this place isn't on your list of places to go, then add it immediately."}
{"text":"This place is sooooo good omg!!!! I dream about the bone marrow. The meat is so tender it just falls off the bone. Can't wait to come back!!! Prob best steak I've had"}
{"text":"So on this visit to Pittsburgh, I had two places on my \"eat at\" list - Cure + Meat and Potatoes. I ended up making reservations at Cure for Sunday Dinner and was lucky enough to arrive 20 mins after Meat and Potatoes opened for their Saturday night trade and since it was early enough, was fortunate and scored a lovely table on the patio.  I gotta say first up, my server was AWESOME!! I was a bit indecisive with the menu (there were so many good choices!) and he was really patient and listed options.  I ended up getting the chicken liver entree and the Crispy Pig ear sandwich which was on the daily specials list.   So thoughts on my liver - it was delicious and so so creamy, almost like pate... but...but for me, the accompanying sauce and breading was too aggressively seasoned. So let me explain - I wanted the liver to stand on it own, but because the breeding was so robust and spicy, I felt the lovely pate like taste and texture of the tender liver was lost. Similarly the accompanying sauce also had an assertive taste and when I dipped my liver into the chipotle remoulade, the delicacy of the liver was lost. I feel this dish could do with some more refinement- I almost wanted something more creamy as my accompanying sauce than the remoulade currently listed on the menu.  For my other dish, first I just want to list the ingredient list for my Crispy Pig Ear sandwich and #5 in particular had me most curious: 1) Grilled ramp BBQ  2) Apple slaw 3) Hazel nuts 4) Pecorino 5) Foie gras mayonnaise  6) Paprika Hot & Sour Fries 7) Ciabatta  So I grew to like this sandwich more as I progressively ate into it - my first bite wasn't all there and frankly the pig ear piece I got was a touch too crispy but as the apple slaw and the pecorino cheese mixed with the lusciousness of the foie gras mayonnaise, this sandwich really came into it's own. The accompanying string fries too were great and all together it was really quite good! Then the taste of the occasional hazelnut would pop up and it would turn very earthy.   So overall definitely an interesting meal and for sure I will come again to try some of the other menu items.  Yelp Review 49/2017"}
{"text":"It was the pig ears on the salad that totally grossed me out... yuck."}
{"text":"A great meal - started with the bone marrow, enjoyed the pork chop and flat iron. Everything was perfectly seasoned and the root to berries cocktail was delicious! Definitely worth a wait."}
{"text":"If you go, you must get the bone marrow. Drinks are solid. As far as a date place, probably not the best choice as it's extremely loud and crowded."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for an impromptu dinner on his birthday. I was able to make reservations at 3PM for 8PM that night (Thursday).  It was really busy and I am glad I made the reservation. I also used OpenTable on my phone so that was also a huge plus for me.  The inside of the restaurant is great - a very high-end barn feel if that makes sense. My boyfriend had the bone marrow for an appetizer - I don't like bone marrow, but he said it was phenomenal.  The mac n' cheese was delicious! The drink menu was very interesting - I highly suggest you tell the bartender what kinds of flavors you like and he will make you an amazing drink that suits your taste.  The desserts were served (and baked) in small mason jars. Cute & practical. The key lime pie was to die for. It was very tart with a vanilla crumble bottom crust. Perfection."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal at this place.  They have so many different things to choose from, and the menu changes every so often which only adds to the variety.  The service is always excellent.  Definitely need to make a reservation though.  They have a comfortable waiting area outside the dining room, along with outdoor seating that's super cute during nice weather.  The pork belly tacos were unreal, and they had an eggnog pana cotta for the holiday's that was to die for.  Meat & Potatoes is probably my favorite place in downtown Pittsburgh.  I hear they have a killer brunch, but I haven't tried it yet!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what the hype is about. Ordered the pub burger to go and the lady on the phone couldn't even explain to me what is in it. She was friendly and nice but....I was confused. She said pork but not beef so I expected only pork. I'm glad that beef was in it but it was too cooked. Also, I noticed that ingredients were missing like the fried egg. And where was the horseradish cheddar? The fries were also extremely salty. I'm bummed cuz I really wanted an awesome burger but I think a fast food joint burger would have been SO much better."}
{"text":"Love it. My friend and I came on weekday evening and were welcomed very sweetly by the hostesses. The food along with the prices are pretty straight forward. We went for a bunch of snacks and one appetizer to split. We had the mac n cheese (amazingly decadent and would definitely order again), poutine (fries were a bit burnt BUT anything tastes good when it's smothered in gravy), bone marrow (largest portion I've come by), mussels in their beer sauce (huge portions and it's a MUST), and their soft shell crab tacos ( we could've done without this, it was way too sweet for my liking).     The staff was really helpful and pleasant and the ambiance was romantic minus the view. We sat outside on the patio and it would've been perfect except for the view of people waiting for the bus and the traffic line up. Not so romantic haha. If they could just put a nice wall of green shrubbery/bamboo to block that out, it would do wonders to the place."}
{"text":"Good food. Cocktails were good too. The Old fashion was a little watered. But overall really good. Would definitely come back to sample other food items."}
{"text":"This has easily become my new favorite restaurant for a fancy night out. Top of the line food and amazing service"}
{"text":"Ooooh this place.  My husband and I went here for our anniversary. First off, the place is LOUD. It's not the place for a quiet candlelit dinner, be forewarned. It was a Tuesday night and it was packed, so have a reservation. The decor is very interesting and edgy.  So anyway, our server tells us the specials. He describes a steak that sounds good, I say I want that. The other steaks on the menu are $25-30 so I figure it's something around that. I get the steak, it's amazing, every bite melts in my mouth. The potatoes with it are also delicious (though I wish there had been more, there was basically a decorative amount of potatoes). Then we split a baked chocolate mousse for dessert which was equally delicious. Service was excellent and attentive throughout.  Then we got the bill. That damn amazing steak was $56. $56! $56!!! I had to laugh (to keep from crying). Now, I'm a frugal person, and I usually don't fall for well-known consumer trickery tactics like the \"special with no price\" but they caught me off guard on this particular night since my husband had encouraged me to \"go with the flow\" after I had lamented the $12 cocktails we ordered earlier at a nearby bar. Here I was trying to carpe the diem and I end up picking the most expensive dish in the world. HA!  I'm just glad it really was the best steak I ever had."}
{"text":"Got lucky and managed to get a reservation for 545 on a Saturday earlier in the week and the earlier dinner time was totally worth it. Interesting and diverse menu, food was excellent, and service was excellent."}
{"text":"Bob and I went here for their brunch a few days after we went for the first time. (I guesstimate some Sunday in November...just never got around to writing the review.)  Chicken and Waffles: Amazing, if not even a little intimidating. M&P takes a new twist on a Southern classic with three huge pieces of fried chicken, jalapeno/cheddar Belgian-style waffles and a bourbon-bacon maple syrup, which was still hot when it came to the table. It was so much food, I could not finish it at the table. Even better reheated the day after.  Huevos Rancheros: Now, Bob and I make this dish at home all the time. For those of you that are unfamiliar, it's a baked/grilled or fried corn or flour tortilla, top it with meat  (chorizo or in M&P's case...chunks of pork), top it with a sunny side up egg or two, a mound of cheese and some ranchero sauce. It's like a Mexican breakfast wrap on steroids. And it's damn good. M&P did not disappoint, and they made it prettier. It was an amazing tower of Mexican flavor explosion.  Ambiance/Atmosphere: We got there right when they opened. We were first in line, and while I'm bad a judging if you need reservations at any place, we were LUCKY we got in. We made a point to be there before they opened, just in case...and we were glad we did. The place filled up in about 15 minutes after we got seated. Service was amazing, and the waitstaff really took care of each other and made sure every aspect of the dining experience was covered. I dropped my spoon from my coffee (which was good!) by accident and 2 seconds later they'd replaced it. Even the owner of M&P was there, helping out and serving. I like that.  Things we didn't try but should have: Red Velvet Pancakes. They also had a Bloody Mary Bar, but considering I don't like tomato juice, it didn't impress me. Really wanted an Old Canadian, but considering it was early, I didn't feel proper doing it.  Will go there again, for realz."}
{"text":"Monday night around dinner time and the wait for a table for 2 was hours! Make a reservation. Luckily there were 2 spots open at the bar which ended up being a ton of fun. 3 men and 1 woman behind the bar, 2 guys ended up taking care of us most of the night. They not only served us well but were friendly and talkative, giving genuine recommendations and sharing funny stories.   Ordered a glass of Prosecco for myself and a whiskey drink for my boyfriend, very good. Started with the tartar, spicy but delicious. Then came pate -amazing- and then devils on horseback. Also a little hot but very good. The bone marrow was excellent and the toppings with it were great. Once we got halfway through the bone marrow the bar tender told us we had the option to do \"luge shots\"  of Jameson out of them once we finished. We happily complied and were given bibs to protect our shirts. Lots of fun. We got the tuna ceviche for dessert which was just the right combination of light and sweet and salty and savory and we finished the night off with a shot of Fernet Branca.   Not cheap and unless you want to risk finding a seat at the bar, plan ahead. But a wonderful place, gorgeous decor, friendly and knowledgeable staff, and amazing food."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the fantastic food and fun atmosphere while visiting Pittsburgh.  We didn't order the fried brussels at first but had to get an order when we saw them delivered to the table next to us.  We were glad we did...they were delicious!  My husband is on a no carb diet so he substituted collard greens for the carb that came with his dish and proclaimed them to be the best he's ever tasted.  I had the Wagyu flat iron which was perfectly prepared and the accompaniments were delicious.  Would love to try their brunch.  Wish we lived closer!"}
{"text":"this place is hip and awesome. i am picky about what restaurants try to sell me and all they are selling is awesome. food took a little bit to come out but was worth the wait. polite and helpful bartenders and a spot-on atmosphere."}
{"text":"The steak was just perfect and delicious, juicy as it can be. The servers were so friendly and deserts were nothing but fantastic. The reservation is highly recommended if you have a party of 3 or more people."}
{"text":"It was a while ago that I was here, but I remember that the food was good, and the service was excellence. Went there before a show, was with a group, and they sat us in a room to ourselves. Overall a great experience would go back."}
{"text":"I was really excited to eat here and have heard good things from a few people. I took my boyfriend for his bday and we ordered fried pig ears, grilled bread, and the 45 oz ribeye.   First off, the fried pig ears came out in a red/white striped French fry basket you'd see at a fair. Not the presentation I was looking for. Also thought they were way overpriced. The bread was okay. Nothing too fancy about some toasted bread.   The steak on the other hand was huge! Great presentation. We ordered it topped with truffle butter which I loved, but my boyfriend wasn't a fan of. We also ordered a side of scalloped potatoes and they were bomb! The steak was extremely fatty though. Overall, I would say most of the weight in the steak came from the bone that was attached and the fat. There wasn't a whole lot of meat to it.   All in all, I would say that meal wasn't worth almost $150. The steak is more of a once in a lifetime thing just to say you ordered a 45 oz steak. We probably won't be going back, but it was a decent date night."}
{"text":"I've been here many times now, and I'm never let down.  The service is always great, love their beer selection, and the BF has vouched for their cocktails.  I've been trying endlessly to replicate their white truffle risotto - it's to die for!  I definitely prefer their dinner menu to their lunch menu, but I have never been disappointed here.  I came here with my family from Chicago recently, and they seemed to really enjoy it as well."}
{"text":"We were in the mood for PROTEIN tonight so headed to meat and potatoes to find it.  Definitely a bumping place at 7 pm on Friday.  A bit too noisy for me to eat dinner, this place is probably better as a happy hour joint.  The chairs = very comfortable.  BUT you have to lean forward in them to be heard in this place.      MUSSELS OF THE DAY- traditional type.  These were tasty BUT I KNEW these were gonna be salty when we ordered and I was right.  I am feeling dehydrated hours later as I write this.  I prefer my mussels cooked in sauce that is more drinkable so you can sop it up.      PUB BURGER- I suppose there was no living up to the fantastic burger I had earlier this week at Burgatory.  This burger was a sad burger in comparison.  Not really to my liking, a little too soggy and lacking in tomato.  The fries were good, crispy and hot.      WAGYU FLAT IRON- My companion claims this was not real wagyu.  Overall it won a rating of \"OKAY\" from him but for 28 dollars, an okay is pretty sad.  Probably will not be back.  Food didn't leave a great impression and neither did our waitress who seemed a little pissy!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants. The ambience, the service, and the food are all perfect. I've never had a bad experience here. Always delicious, always consistent."}
{"text":"We come here for date nights and love the ambience. We always order the meat for two which is a 34oz slab of meat with a side of bone marrow and potato wedges, plus a glass of red wine and you have the best meat and potatoes in town."}
{"text":"I sat at the bar to have some dinner. Ordered the hanger steak which was about $26. It was cooked medium rare like i instructed. It was served over some potatoes Brussel sprouts. My disappointment was that it was cold. The cold steak made it crewy and difficult to eat. I took 2 bites and told the waiter that the steak was cold and i was  not happy. He told me well its really cold in here so you kinda have eat it quick... What? I wont come back here. I cant believe i was served a COLD steak"}
{"text":"Amazing. The food was beyond expectation and the service is top notch. Nice beer selection and cocktail list."}
{"text":"This place is a must try when in Pittsburgh. The restaurant is little hard to find and do whatever in your power to find it and your pallet will thank you.   I showed up for dinner on Monday night around 7 pm and the place was packed. Grab a seat at the bar and grabbed few beers from the happy hour menu. Both beers very very interesting and I must admit I chose them based on their name (porkslap pale ale and raging bitch Belgium ale). The bartender working that night was very knowledgeable about the bar and food menu and helped me made my dinner selection.   Potato gnocchi with dirty duck ragu is what I have chosen and I couldn't been happier. The plate came out perfect, gnocchi were mixed with duck and braised in the most delicious and flavorful juices. The center of the plate was dressed with a soft boiled egg made perfectly. I  have enjoyed every single bite and if it was socially acceptable I would lick the plate.   Overall I always have great meals when I am in Pittsburgh but this one stood a mile above the rest including the bartender man who shows up with the most positive attitude."}
{"text":"My second trip and took my family for brunch on a weekend.  The food was terrific and very flavorful.  The had a DJ playing and it had a great vibe.  The only reason not 5 stars is it is very loud with really tight seating.  Overall great experience."}
{"text":"A nice place for datenight meeting  friends for happy hour or just mingle..the food is super good .. They have a dinner for 2 on the menu that you and ur boo can create .. Also you have to try there smoked wings OMG!!! Super yummy..  So check this place out my yelpers"}
{"text":"Bloody Mary bar was much better than others I've been to.  We had the Bruscetta with wild mushroom ragu and a nouveau take on Eggs Benedict... poached egg over sweetbreads, with shrimp and pork cheeks. Very tasty.  The only problem was how close we sat to other guests. Didn't really want to be a part of their conversations."}
{"text":"Celebrated our annual girlfriend gift exchange here. We hot the private room in the front of the restaurant. Our server was excellent! We had a large group and we all needed separate checks. He was polite, friendly and attentive. I ordered the mushroom risotto to start, the flavor was delicious! Very creamy and full of mushroom flavor. I would have preferred the actual risotto to be softer it was firm but everyone seemed to enjoy it. For main entree I had the steak rare. It was cooked perfect, has great flavor and was melt in your mouth good. The prices here are on the high side but the food quality is high. The cocktails menu is great and they have a awesome brunch. I would give a 5 star if the menu was expanded a bit more with more fish options. But then again it is named meat and potatoes for a reason."}
{"text":"One of the best meals my wife and I ever had.  This is my first time in Pittsburgh and our taxi driver recommended the place. I wasn't sure whether to trust him and I had not seen any reviews or ratings.  Huge portions and a good variety.  I had tge salmon and my wife the pork chop, which was a double. We also ordered the hummus appetizer and fried Brussels.  We had drinks.  I had the Manhattan and it was terrific.  We'd come back again."}
{"text":"Excellent. Great food. I especially liked their ma and cheese. The wait staff was wonderful. One of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"It was ok, alot of my friends talk about how good this place is, but I went it was packed. You sit so close to everyone very unfortable to be honest. The burgers were so dry. It was so disappointing. I always want to give this place a second chance but then I think about the seating and really don't care to come back. I don't like being packed into a resturant like a sardine."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. I split the 34 oz ribeye, bone marrow and potatoes with my wife and it was amazing. Good quality steak that was a perfect medium rare, medium. Enjoyed a few beers and cocktails as well. This place is ideal for a business dinner, or date night. I hear their brunch is phenomenal as well. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The wagyu flat iron was indeed delicious. That alone can get 5 stars from me. the kobe corn dog was good but nothing outrageous. The fried taters were ok. You get a huge bowl if you order them...enough for two. Garlic all over them. Their selection is better at lunch vs. dinner it seems."}
{"text":"The name alone does it for me. I had high expectations and they delivered. My friend set up a brunch on a Saturday at noon and the place was bumping with people. We were promptly seated - there were 5 of us. I didn't even notice the portions other people had at their table, but I was about to be surprised.  I got the Lavender drink, which was pink and bubbly with a good combination of sweet/tart. Then I ordered fried taters with a truffle mayonnaise. We all shared those and they were gone in a split second. Super delicious! Someone else got house-made granola and I only tried a spoonful, but the dish was ginormous.  For the main dish I ordered chicken and waffles. Before I knew it, what looked like a whole freakin' chicken was in front of me with waffles and a bourbon bacon syrup...which I accidentally spilled all over the table. I was kind of mortified even though the waiter was like \"Psh, you're fine!\" and got me another side of syrup. Everything was really, really good. I need to go back and eat everything!"}
{"text":"Disappointed.  I was so excited to finally try Meat & Potatoes and it failed to live up to what I hoped it would be.  First off the ambiance was fantastic, I  loved the decor and the feel of the restaurant.  I thought it was modern and inviting.  My table of 4 got a bad break to begin with being seated right by the patio door.  Normally I don't think this would've been a huge issue, but it was almost 100 degrees outside.  The door was constantly being open and shut and it really made the two of us closest to the door extremely hot (how did people eat outside!).    We started with some cocktails, and they were all fantastic.  The Corpse Reviver was the standout of the group and I recommend it highly.  After perusing the menu for a bit, myself and someone at our table decided to split the Meat & Potatoes for 2.  It is a 34 oz Ribeye, Steak Fries and Bone Marrow.  Doing the math we figured that this would be plenty of food for two people, thus we only got the Grilled Bread with Goat Butter and Jam to start, it was very good and the jam was fantastic.    We were very wrong when we thought it would be plenty of food for two people, especially two men.  It might have been a 34 oz ribeye if they count the 2 foot bone sticking out of the ribeye because it definitely wasn't enough for two people.  We ordered our ribeye medium and it came out really rare, we are talking barely warm in the middle rare.  I can usually understand not getting the steak completely correct, but I've almost never been served a piece of meat as off as this one was.  Instead of cooking us a new one, they cooked the pieces we had already cut off and what was left on the bone and brought it back out.  I understand this because it was an expensive piece of meat I'm assuming, but still was a little off putting.  The fries and bone marrow were nothing special in my mind.  Neither one was especially flavorful or memorable.    We then skipped desert because of the heat radiating from the constant open doorway next to us and called it a night.   Maybe I'll give Meat & Potatoes another chance, but it's definitely not somewhere I'll be running back to.  UPDATE:  After going back a couple more times and eating lunch there I'm upping my review to 4 stars.  Their lunch menu is fantastic, and I would recommend it highly."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  Meat&Potatoes has the best and the most interesting cocktails in town (and they are consistent at that!).  The food was superb - she had the agnoletti, and I the pappardelle (bolognese), which was much improved from the first them I had it.  On the downside, their facilities (washrooms shared with the cabaret club next door) are below par and simply do not go with the rest of this place.  The solution they used to have was much better.  So, one star less."}
{"text":"Pros: Food is excellent - we got a pub burger and a chicken sandwich and were really pleased with it.  Cons: short alcohol list/few beers on draft, the prices seemed a little ridiculous even for being an upscale downtown restaurant, the atmosphere was stuffy and not very warm or welcoming."}
{"text":"Meat & Potatoes has really yummy food.  My husband and I tried the specialty mushroom risotto, bone marrow flat bread, mushroom flatbread and the salmon.  They were all delicious.  This restaurant reminds of me a similar restaurant in Los Angeles that Iron Chef Mario Batali owns, called Mozza.  I must say, the server kept making mistakes with our food and brought out things that we didn't order, but that wasn't a big deal.  We loved this place and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I've been giving a lot of five star reviews lately, but truly on the driving vacation I was on, I managed to stumble on a bunch of really excellent stops...thanks to Yelp.  Truly innovative menu and perfect execution of the dishes.  Service was outstanding.  Recommended, the bone marrow appetizer, really special.  The \"pork\" on the main menu was a massive double cut, brined and smoked pork chop that was just amazing."}
{"text":"Oh Meat & Potatoes. You've done a fine job at luring me into your eclectic dining and bar space. I can't seem to stop myself from wandering back in. The dimmed lights and delicious mixed drinks are two of the reasons I'm cool with you. And the menu is as adventurous as my soul. There's always something new, different and borderline questionable on the menu so there's never a dull moment.   One big turnoff however is the tight quarters we diners and drinkers have to be in.  Although I put up with it, it's always awkward when I'm standing at the bar and my behind is bumping into the backs of diners' beautiful heads. Apologies are being given out as often as drinks are being poured.   With that being said, my favorite part is watching the show being performed behind the bar.  The bar tenders are true artists creating drinks worth writing home about. They are unique and delicious and I can never just get one. Well done!  So, Meat & Potatoes, although you're small inside and I have to endure more awkward moments in one night than anyone should in a year, I will be back."}
{"text":"Best Manhattan I have ever had! No joke!  This place is a great spot in downtown Pitt. The location is very well done in a modern gastropub format but in a old location. The service is really great.   Max and cheese- so cheesy and delicious- worth trying   Had the wagu + lobster & also grilled cheese.   Everything was spot on and the flavor was outrageous \"! Only complaint is everything was not hot just luke warm. The flavors made up for it by a mile and the presentation was perfect. More than you expect for the price."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place for brunch! Love the bloody Mary bar and all the ingredients and the infused vodkas!! My husband and I have tried so many of the brunch options. My personal two favorites are the bruschetta and the huevos rancheros! Its our top spot for brunch!!!! Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is over the top good.  We had a large party, celebrating a birthday, and each and every one of us talked about our meals over and over again for the last several days.  Personally, we decided to order a bunch of appetizers to munch on versus a full meal.  We started with the fried pickles and mussels with beer broth.  The fried pickles were possibly the best I ever had with thick cut pickles and a delicious dipping sauce.  The mussels were very good, not my favorite, but very fresh tasting.  If I went back, I would try the curry broth which we heard was fantastic.  We then ordered the watermelon salad, short rib flat bread, wings and mac n' cheese.  Every item we ordered was amazing.  My favorites were the short rib flat bread and wings.  The short rib was so smoky and cooked to perfection.  The combination on the flat bread was mouth watering.  The wings were spicy and smoky at the same time.  I'm not a huge wing lover, but I would order these again and again.  Lastly, the drinks were amazing.  My fiance ordered the Pimms Blue Ribbon and it was very refreshing.  I ordered the daquiri and agree that it was a very light drink.    Everyone else around us ordered the pork chop, poutine, and a number of other appetizers.  The one that stood out was the pork chop which was cooked to perfection and had a delightful pancetta topping.  We all tried a bite and it was to die for!  All in all, an amazing experience!"}
{"text":"Beware, this review may not be butterflies and unicorns.  I gave this place two tries. The first time was a better experience then the second, but was not excellent. There is hot competition around meat and Potatoes right now, so if you are visiting the city you may want to compare the restaurants around this one. You walk into a lobby. The restaurant basically took over the lobby and made it where the hostess stand is and where you can sit and wait. The restaurant itself is very very tall, but there is not very many tables, so making a reservation may be a good idea. We visited on a Friday night around 90pm. It was not busy, there were plenty of open table. The person with me had never been. When we got to the restaurant we walked in first to see if it was busy before we put our name in. When we went back to the hostess to put our name in, my friend said that we wanted a table near the bar, but not in another room. The hostess snapped back at her and said, \"there is NOT another room. This is it!\" The attitude was very uncalled for, however my stare at the girl was not. I digress, and wait to be seated because we were starving and I still wanted my friend to try the food. We get seated after waiting only 3 minutes. The seats were comfortable. Very cushioned, like living room seating. The server came over to us with in a couple minutes, she was very attentive through out. Now to make my review shorter then it could be, I will recommend food items that I have tried, things I would not. This is what a non beef eater orders at a meat and potatoes restaurant! Don't judge!  The fried pickles, they are cut thick and you are given 5 or 6 pieces with a side of dipping sauce. Tasted good, but being an app, it was quite small. Served in a literary a small fair French fried basket. Wasn't sure if I was to laugh or be disappointed.  The poutine was good, however it was served a little cold. Being that gravy cools quickly, maybe having it served in a higher bowl to contain the heat better. Just a suggestion. The apps are very small portions as well, being you are intended on sharing them, having them a bit bigger would be fab. The buffalo chicken Mac n chz. This was very creamy, not so cheesy. I was overwhelmed by the buffalo sauce. The sauce, not the spice. My friend said it was spicy, but for someone that likes the spice kick, this was just too \"buffaloie\". Not very original in a good way. This was also a small portion. Not was served with it.  My overall opinion is that this place is given way too much credit. The food is eh (there are better around). The price is holy mackerel. The portions are no bigger the your hand (put your hand out. They are NOT any bigger then that, mostly smaller). Nothing is served with the meals (at least the non steak ones). The atmosphere is cute, the chairs comfortable, the \"server service\" great, the front staff- immature and need etiquette class. If the owners don't start listening to the \"little things\" that people are having issues with, I can almost guarantee this place will be closed within the next one to two years. The competition is on fire."}
{"text":"Everything was fine, but not necessarily worth a repeat visit. Two of us went on a Friday night around 10:15 PM and were seated outside with no wait -- but there were still plenty of people around eating and enjoying, which was pleasant.   The staff was friendly and accommodating, and I can be a pain in the butt sometimes (gluten) so it was nice to feel taken-care of.   We ordered:  Bone marrow appetizer: delicious.  Waldorf Salad: surprisingly boring and iceberg lettuce-y, given the description on the menu. Tartare: meat was fresh, they had to leave a few things out for me because they were not gluten-free so it was missing a bit of something. They brought a sauce out for my dining companion and he said it made a big difference.  Hanger Steak entree: nothing wrong with it, but it didn't taste as interesting as the menu made it seem like it would be.   For a \"we're hungry, let's grab a bite\" it was fine but overpriced. Had we gone for a celebration meal, I would have left feeling disappointed."}
{"text":"Wow. Can we talk about Meat and Potatoes for a second? I went here for the first time last night (finally, I know, stop judging me). I had a mouthgasm. Simple as that.  Absolutely love the ambiance of the place - dark colors, dim lighting, jazzy music... it was just what we were looking for. The feel of this place is classy, but not uptight. The service was friendly, expedient, and professional - to the level of a five star restaurant, while still putting out a casual, relaxed vibe.   I started off with a \"Turn the Beet Around\" ...yes the song kept popping into my head throughout dinner, and yes I did dance in my chair while sitting. I love anything spicy so it was already looking up. Reposado, lime, orange liqueur, jalapeño, and beet syrup. It was quite an unusual winning combination. Smash together, fruity/spicy/a bit of savory, add tequila - and it just popped.  Next was the duck liver pâté. At first the sweetness of the sauternes jelly on top cuts through the more savory flavor of the duck, but it rounds out as you eat it, and has a nice savory finish. Its perfectly paired with a simple grilled bread (to which they gladly brought a refill).  Shortly after, came out the wild mushroom risotto. It was definitely good, the mushrooms were tasty, but I'm having trouble remembering details because of what came next!.......   The roasted chicken! It definitely stole the show, and I'm not afraid to say, it's probably the best thing I've eaten this year.  Served beside their yukon gold potatoes, adorned with roasted tomatoes, olives, and pine nuts, laid on a saffron butter sauce, and topped with fennel. This dish was clearly crafted by a true culinary artist. Besides the chicken being perfectly cooked and juicy, the way the flavors came together was just something I had never tasted before, and we just kind of sat there in awe/bliss until it was all gone.   I couldn't believe that we had drinks, appetizers, and dinner for two, at this quality for only $77. Last week I paid almost $200 for worse service and mediocre food at another place downtown. I must get back here asap.... I need that brunch in my life. See you soon!"}
{"text":"Long story short, this place doesn't live up to their price. The establishment is fancy enough but weirdly integrated in the building that it inhabits, which causes some issues with their welcoming of patrons, their restroom location and their general state of apparent confusing entrance.  The smell of alcohol (although quality one from what I can see) is pungent to the point of annoyance, and speaks to a questionable ventilation. The decor is fancy without being overstated, yet the place is a little crowded creating a packed atmosphere that detracts from the elegant dining ambiance. The food itself is equally divided between uninspiring (their staple truffled potatoes and their burgers) to the good but incredibly pricey(the tartare was literally a couple of spoons for 14$ or so, although I must give them props for the very well put together presentation). The (almost) saving grace was the Flatbread, reasonably priced, sizeable if not generous, and cleverly balancing the fat of the charcuterie with the crispy dryness of the base. Thumbs up for our attentive server, who was informative and fast to refill our drinks."}
{"text":"The setting is very nice.The drinks were great and the food is amazing"}
{"text":"Went to dinner before a show. I've been there a good number of times since their opening, but it's been about a year since my last visit. I was pleased that it still stood up to my previous visits. We order the squid ink tagliatelle pasta dish, and it was honestly spectacular. Their Brussels and grilled bread were good starters and they salty pig flat bread was as good as always. The only negative was that we ordered two more beers towards the end of our meal as waters, and we never got them, even after we asked twice."}
{"text":"Now that I've tried M&P about 5 times, I'm happy to report that it's another great addition to the Pittsburgh food scene. I've had dinner here a few times and was never disappointed. I've also tried the brunch which is, after Tamari's amazing new Sunday brunch, one of the best in the city (don't forget to save room for the all you can drink Bloody Mary bar).   I would have given them 5 stars, but I actually don't really love the ambiance. M&P gets a lot of the downtown pre-theater crowd and it always feels a bit too full. If you like the over-filled loud scene, you won't object, but that's just not for me. Regardless, the food is top notch!"}
{"text":"the marrow was absolutely amazing. Turned my hubby into a convert.  Go and get the \"meat butter\". It is totally worth it. The rest of dinner was great as well."}
{"text":"Their brunch is the best I've ever had. The Bloody Mary Bar is everything."}
{"text":"I had kept this place bookmarked for the longest time and I finally got a chance to go here!  So lets start off by saying that It was okay.   The more I think about the meal the more I realize that I don't think I enjoyed it as much as I thought. The place itself was really nice but parking was a bit tough downtown at night. The atmosphere was definitely something different but it was quite crowded and noisy.  I actually loved the \"snacks\" that they had, we ordered buttermilk fried chicken livers and fried brussels. The livers were perfectly soft and the dip that it came with was perfect.  The brussels also came with a dip that I was pretty happy with as well.    For the main course we ordered a lamb burger and a korean reuben.  I thought  that the fusion was a creative idea but the execution was nothing spectacular.  The burgers also came with a bowl of fries and as a huge french fry fan I was delighted.  I liked the fries better than the reuben but my boyfriend didn't have a taste for them because they were a bit on the salty side.  They definitely didn't skimp on the portions like a lot of other pricier restaurants do which was a huge plus for me because I was working up an appetite.  They didn't have a menu for desserts but the waitress listed them off to us and none of them sounded particularly appetizing. As we were leaving I caught someone ordering a bone marrow and that looked like it was definitely worth trying!   TLDR: Meh, I'd go again but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"Good not great. Did not meet expectations. First the fried Brussel sprouts were yummy with lots of cheese and a pretty ho hum mayo sauce. Then we split the huge pork chop which took quite a long time to arrive. It was wonderful and cooked perfectly. Plenty for two!  A healthy portion of collards and beans but the greens were way too sweet but were cooked perfectly with some \"tooth.\"  The beans were less than tender definitely undercooked. So the two sides were not very good. Would try again maybe mussels?  They looked interesting."}
{"text":"Interesting food, the bone marrow is delicious, just ask for extra toast. I've been with groups that rave about the duck. I'm a huge fan of the pork and beans."}
{"text":"I had not been to M&P since shortly after it first opened so when I chose a random Friday night I knew my bf would be in town, I booked a 9:30 reservation for the two of us. Parking is so convenient due to the Theater Square garage being in the same building. I forget the cost, but I do remember it was quite reasonable. We arrived a little early and our table wasn't ready yet so we sat on one of the couches in the lobby for a few minutes until we were taken back. The tables when you first walk in are a very tight squeeze, however, we were seated on the opposite side of the dining room, and I did not find the tables to be too tight together. We were not privy to our table neighbors conversations so there was a decent amount of space between each table.   Our server was very efficient and attentive without being intrusive. She quickly got us water and let us peruse the drink menu a bit further. My bf decided not to have a drink, which meant I had to have two-one for him AND one for me ;) The drinks were expertly made-I had a bourbon drink and a whiskey drink. They were very tasty and very strong, but I wasn't the one driving so bring it on! We started out with the Lobster mac and cheese. It was so creamy and the doritos crust really added a unique touch to the dish. There were several chunks of lobster mixed uniformly throughout. This was easily the best lobster mac I have had in quite some time, possibly ever! I totally wish I didn't have to share because I could have downed that dish in a few scoops just by myself, it was that good! The portion was a nice size as well, perfect for two. My boyfriend had the duck which was cooked PERFECTLY to a medium rare. It was melt in your mouth juicy, and I will absolutely order that dish on my next visit! I went with the short rib flatbread after reading rave reviews on that dish on Yelp. I was impressed-the bleu cheese was not overpowering and the short rib was so very tender and juicy. I liked the arugula on top as well-VERY tasty! I wanted to save room for dessert so I left one small piece behind.  I was disappointed they ran out of the pot de creme and the chocolate smores dessert, however, they had a red velvet cookie cake that was TO DIE for! I'm not even a red velvet fan and I'd totally order this again, although I am hoping next time they don't run out of the chocolate pot de creme. This was a stellar dining experience, from service to food to ambience. I will ABSOLUTELY return (and hopefully it's for brunch!)"}
{"text":"I've been to Meat & Potatoes numerous times but this past weekend it was all about that...  BRUNCH BRUNCH BRUNCH!   Highlights: -Grapeleaves included at the Bloody Mary bar! The hot sauce variety is the best I've ever seen. -The Strawberry or Peach Bellini. -Fried taters with truffle aioli. Shut the front door. I wish I could eat this dish every day.   The experience: We had a group of 12 so we reserved the side room. To be expected, it's a bit loud but a must-have if you are attending with a large group. Our service was excellent. The waiter knew each dish, made perfect recommendations and was quick to notice when our beverages got low. The food runners we're also speedy and professional. We had one small incident with a loose coffee lid and a bit of hot brew landing on the back of my date but it was handled well and certainly didn't ruin our time there.   Food: I ordered the Shrimp & Grits, most of the table ordered the short rib hash (it's the most popular brunch item) and the rest of the dishes included the Pub burger, Bi Bim Bap, Huevos Ranchero, Eggs in purgatory and Chicken and Waffles. The Chicken and Waffles portion size made everything else seem like an appetizer! I thought that seemed a little inconsistent but that's not a huge complaint, I needed a to-go box for my meal and it was half the size! No major issues with any of the food. A bit of hot sauce needed for a few of the dishes but that's more personal preference than a stab at the quality of the food. I found my dish to be very rich, part of the reason I had to take the rest home. The flavor was wonderful, I only mention how rich it is so my fellow yelpers are aware.   The dining experience at Meat & Potatoes for lunch and dinner has long held a superb reputation and I am happy to report that their brunch experience is no different! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Best place to eat downtown/cultural district area. Make sure that you make reservations tho! The roast beef was mouth watering, the duck was surprisingly delicious as well. They also have vegan options on the menu. Good atmosphere."}
{"text":"I'm so glad Meat and Potatoes finally got to meet my belly. Ha ha, dad jokes aside--I've had this place bookmarked for quiet some time now and glad I came here for dinner today! To start, we shared the pig ears. If you are hesitant about trying this, don't be! They came in shredded crispy bacon like presentation and was seasoned very well.   For the main meal, I got the pot roast, and the beef was absolute perfection: the gravy mix, butter, and some jarred pepperoncini peppers came together to make one delicious & tender pot roast! It's served on a bed of creamy mashed potatoes and garnish game is off the hook. For dessert, try the chocolate mousse! You won't regret it! I would definitely go back, if not for a full meal then just to sit at the bar, order a drink and the chocolate mousse!"}
{"text":"oh, downtown pittsburgh, why can't you have more restaurants like this. absolutely delicious with a strong selection of brown booze. from veggies to fish to steak, meat & potatoes wow'd me.   my work takes me out of bounds rather frequently, and while for the most part, i don't mind it, what i do mind is being away from all the amazing options that my city, more specifically, new york city, has to offer. meat & potatoes has become my saving grace. wings, fish tacos, salmon, steak, pork chop... i haven't made a misstep yet. meat & potatoes, and its sister restaurant, butcher & the rye, are bright & shiny stars in a rather dark area, hopefully serving as a guiding light to other chefs looking to open restaurants downtown.   but alas, for now, until those other chefs find their way, you'll find me settled in at the bar here or across the street at butcher & the rye, happy & grateful for these bright and shiny stars."}
{"text":"Meat & Potatoes. The moment I saw this pop up on my Yelp app I knew I was going here regardless of the rating.   We had brunch here and next time I'm in town I plan to get dinner here. We had the sourdough french toast, fried chicken and waffles with cheddar and jalapeno peppers and bourbon bacon syrup. Splooge. Everywhere. For the price, the quantity and quality of the food they serve is unreal. Too bad I do not have two stomachs, because if I did, I would have ordered more. Every item on the menu was something I would order.  I ordered a black IPA but the waitress brought a regular IPA. This wasn't a huge deal for me, but when I asked her about it she said she would check on it. She never came back or offer to change it to what I ordered. I let the beer sit assuming she would switch it out but it just got warm and I drank it after realizing she either forgot or blew me off. Again, not a big deal, but this place would have been 5 stars if it weren't for that."}
{"text":"In the neighborhood for a show. This place didn't disappoint. We sat at the bar. All bartenders were friendly and helpful. We got a beet salad, bone marrow, and wings. This was hands down one of the best places for bone marrow we have been."}
{"text":"Always excellent food, cocktails,  & service. Make a reservation though because the bar can get very crowded and there is a long wait."}
{"text":"I had eaten here before, so I booked an alumni event here for roughly 40 people. I could not have been happier with the result: amazing food, delicious drinks and a fun, private atmosphere (back room). They even created a custom drink for us based on an Ohio bar's recipe. The restaurant was extremely accommodating and flexible with what we wanted for the event. I highly recommend booking a smaller event here for something casual yet sophisticated."}
{"text":"Meat & Potatoes is my favorite brunch spot in Pittsburgh! I highly recommend making reservations, especially if there is a show or game in town.  The first time my husband and I visited, we did not have reservations--but we arrived right when they opened; we were able get get seats at the bar., however, within 15 minutes of sitting down, there was not one seat left at the bar.  My husband and I both had a blood orange and caramelized pineapple Bellini-- it wasn't on the menu, but the bartender recommended it--simply delicious!   My Husband ordered the bacon, egg, and cheese biscuit special-- scrambled eggs, thick cut bacon, and cheese served on a giant homemade biscuit, with truffle mayo and a side of frittes. I had the omelette special, which had blue cheese and mushrooms, served with a side of their au gratin potatoes. Both meals were phenomenal!   My mom came with me on my next visit to M&P for brunch before we headed over to the Benedum to see a show. I made reservations a few weeks in advance, and I'm glad I did-- I overheard the hostess tell the party in front of us there would be a 1.5 hour wait!   We were seated upon arrival, and our waiter Shane was at our table in no time! My mom and I both opted for the Bloody Mary bar--we both had the garlic and black pepper infused vodka, and proceeded to top our bloody's with the amazing variety of toppings available. It's hard to believe the Bloody Mary bar is only $5!   For our meal, I had the BPLT and my mom got the Quiche of the day. My sandwich was delicious; this version of a simple classic had arugula, pastrami belly, thick cut bacon, ripe tomatoes, and truffle mayo all wedged between two pieces of grilled bread. I don't remember exactly what was in the quiche, but I think it had pork, peppers and scallions. It is served room temperature, which I found a little odd, but the flavors were amazing. It was served along side a house salad, which really balanced the dish nicely. We finished our meals with a cup if coffee, which was also delicious!  The service is impeccable, the drinks are fantastic, the food is stellar, and the manager stops to talk to the tables (which is a nice touch). I highly recommend stopping in for brunch in the very near future!"}
{"text":"This is a beautiful restaurant with wonderfully crafted drinks, in house infused liquors and good service.  The drink production is a mini show and takes 10 minutes to get a beverage. Good or bad that's up to the individual.  The service was ok our waiter Josh appeared in the weeds and forgot to bring several ordered items.  We ordered fried chicken livers which were super crisp but cold bloody livers inside, sent the back and they refried the same order only to burn them and reserve. We sent them back only to find they were left on our bill and our waiter did not return after running our credit cards. My pastrami crusted duck was served on whole wheat spätzle, the spätzle was fried and burnt to the point where it had the consistency of pistachio shells (inedible).  The 34oz ribeye was beautiful but be prepared for a wait 45 minutes for medium (with a cold rare center on the bone). Time for a new cook in the kitchen."}
{"text":"We returned for brunch and good lord am I happy we did! If you don't make reservations at least a month in advance, then I suggest you arrive a half hour before they open to get your name on a list for seats at the bar. And sitting at the bar is super convenient because it's right beside the Bloody Mary bar. There are tons of pictures on here of this bad boy, and I saw several people taking pictures to show friends and family, but let me say, none of them does this Bloody Mary bar justice. You could seriously just order the bar and make a meal out of all the amazing toppings that are on the bar. (Don't do this though, people will probably sneer at you). But seriously it's fantastic! My only issue is that the mix to make the actual drink was really lacking in any flavor. It may have truly been just tomato juice as the Worcestershire, Tabasco, etc were all available on the bar. I was a little disappointed. At least make me a delicious bass that I can add a little or a lot of spice to and then lots of toppings. I'm all for a little DIY but let's draw the line somewhere. Now a not about the chicken and waffles. They are delicious, no doubt about it, but it is HALF OF A CHICKEN. No lie. Half of the entire chicken. I burst out laughing when they brought the plate out. I had enough leftover for 4 more meals (but not enough of that delish syrup!) so be forewarned."}
{"text":"holy garlic.. it was good but I am still tasting it today and so is my wife. She had the risotto and I had the Korean Reuben. The meat on the Reuben was excellent but it could have done without the overwhelming garlic especially if you plan on talking to anyone in the next 24hrs"}
{"text":"A native of western PA, I came back to celebrate my Mother's 76th birthday with her and told her to choose a restaurant she would not driver herself to. She picked Meat and Potatoes and I have heard of it so I was pleased to give it a try. Today, I live in the Phoenix area where a food revival has been occurring for the last decade. This prohibition themed area is comfortable and bright. The mixologists at the bar have an array of magic at their fingertips. We asked for a specialty martini for Mom that was tasty and not too strong. He whipped up a raspberry citrusy take on the cosmopolitan for her that was bright and sweet and pink and delicious. I opted for my classic Belvedere martini with bleu cheese stuffed olives. Mom chose the duck breast and I had the lamb neck cassoulet. Both were extraordinary and huge! Luckily we chose not to have an appetizer so we filled ourselves and sipped a delish pinot noir from our friendly server Adam. The atmosphere is light with 1970s pop music playing of Elton John, Billy Joel and James Taylor and diners were businessmen, families with kids, theater goers and young people. I recommend this meaty, comfortable take on amazing food without any reservations."}
{"text":"Great place! The food is priced as it should be and the portions are generously applied."}
{"text":"Yikes! That's one huge hunk of meat! (That's what she said!)  Try the fried Brussels, they are awesome. The Meat & Potatoes for two is more like Meat and Potatoes for four. We're not petite people, but this was more than we could handle. Still, the bone-in ribeye was cooked perfectly. The marrow was kinda weird. Guess we just weren't that into it. The two classic cocktails I ordered (Negroni and Manhattan) were well balanced. My one complaint would be the service. The girls at the reception seemed lost and flustered, and one even commented that the software they were using was \"dumb\" (because she didn't know how to use it?). The tables are tiny, and they really pack you in there. It's a small place, so I guess space is at a premium. The waitress seemed almost overwhelmed, like she needed to get to her next task in a hurry, and we were keeping her from someone else more important.   Some customer-service focused training on the waitstaff would dramatically improve the overall experience. Like everyone else says, the food is fantastic, but the service is a bit spotty."}
{"text":"We had the bone marrow for the appetizer and it was mouth watering. We then got the pork chop which was huge and was so juicy, had tons of flavor. I had the mushroom risotto which was cooked perfectly. The drinks were phenomenal. They know how to make awesome cocktails and the service was perfect!"}
{"text":"I went here with a group of friends to socialize and catch up as one of them was visiting. Parking is easy enough as there's parking garages close by, but the location between a Cabaret theater and a music hall means it can get busy before or after shows. Inside is dim with atmosphere and small, but it has a nice feel to it, plus the seats are very comfortable.  Appetizers of flatbread pizza, fried pickles, and mussels were a great way to start. The pizza was very flavorful and I really liked it. The fried pickles were done in a way that the breading stuck with the pickles and didn't come apart when eaten. It wasn't that sour either, but just the right amount. The mussels by themselves could have served a meal. There were quite a bit as an appetizer and split nicely between the five of us. The soup base was an interesting mix of bacon and salmon roe, which worked extremely well with the mussels and bread on top.  For entrees, I ordered the salmon along with another friend while other people ordered a burger, lamb shank, and pork chops with apple coleslaw. The salmon they had was a fusion of sorts where they mixed the idea of Korean bibimbap with an egg on salmon cooked medium. The salmon was cooked nicely, but combined the rest, it was a bit of a miss. The kimchi under the fish and the sauce used for bibimbap completely overpowered the whole dish. The black rice they used is supposed to be soft and sticky when cooked traditionally, but they seemed to have pan fried it to give it a crunchy texture. It could have worked, but tasted more like uncooked rice. The cucumber was slightly sweet and went along with the dish, but the kimchi/sauce still overpowered everything.  Trying some of my friend's dishes, the lamb shank was soft and smooth, which I enjoyed. The pork was cooked well and my friend really enjoyed it. The serving size for both of these were large and filling. The salmon was a good size and filling as well. I didn't get a chance to try the hamburger, but my friend enjoyed it.  For dessert, I decided to try the tiramisu they had. The presentation in a jar wasn't what I was expecting as tiramisu is usually presented as a small block on a dish. Once I dug in, I realized why it was in a jar:  The texture of dessert was more like pudding than bread-like, most likely due to the alcoholic content in it. Other than that, it was normal tiramisu in a more pudding form. It was okay, nothing impressive, but nothing bad either.  Overall, with good service and good dishes for the most part, I would recommend people to try this place."}
{"text":"Trendy ad f**k lol. This place reminded me more of a philly spot than an NY...can't put my finger on it but that's just the vibe I got. My bartender made me some really sexy drinks while looking great with a super cool hair cut and outfit complete with vest. The bar staff knew their stuff I will say. I really felt like I benefited meal wise by sitting at the bar and not a table. I got to ask random questions about anything on the menu. I went with the steak tartare which was great but it had a lot going on. Brisket Mac n cheese was amazing and so filling. Just an app but it hit me like a brick. Great drinks, great food and a really sexy atmosphere. Parking was relatively easy too one street over (free after 6). Great place for a date or drink after work."}
{"text":"O man.... I love the dinner menu at Meat and Potatoes, I really do, but I think the brunch is overrated. It's not nearly close to one of the best brunches I've had. I recommend skipping brunch and just doing dinner here instead."}
{"text":"I think this might be the best restaurant in pittsburgh right now. It's outrageously good. I will give you an unnecessary cautionary note about ordering fish there: it's not nearly as good as the other stuff. The other stuff is so goddamned good though that I don't care. The bone in ribeye is epic and absolutely must be shared. The fried chicken is also really great. Oh and the barrel aged whiskey? Yeah, I love it.   Their brunch is also really goddamned good. The dishes are fantastic and they let you build your own bloody mary. I love that."}
{"text":"I came here for Easter brunch and had the pub burger. best. burger. of my LIFE.  It was a beef patty topped with pastrami belly (think...thick, pepper-y, DELICIOUS bacon), a fried egg, horseradish cheddar (where have you been all my life?!), and truffle mayo.  Holy.  The fries were delish as well.  Do yourself a favor and come here.  The bf ordered chicken & waffles, and while he enjoyed it, he didn't like it as much as my burger.  He also said the Irish breakfast (coffee, Jameson, maple whipped cream, orange) was good, as well.  5 stars.  Everything was perfect!  Looooooved the vibe, environment, decor, & music.  Our server Joe was the greatest - so detailed, attentive, and friendly!!  I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best brunch spot I have found so far in Pittsburgh. Based on 2 important things: the food and how impressive their Bloody Mary bar is. I ordered the huevos rancheros as my entree as this is my favorite breakfast dish. I expected just your average huevos rancheros but this was so much more. It was topped with pulled pork and picked onions which was excellent together.  The Bloody Mary bar is out of this world though. You can choose between multiple infused vodkas such as old bay, bacon, dill pickle, etc. They have a vast number of different toppings that will keep you wanting to make multiple trips."}
{"text":"Wow. The menu here was comparable with Les Halles in NYC, and the quality was on par if not even better. My mom and I came here with no reservations on a Sunday night and were given a seat in under 20 minutes-open table had no more reservations and I knew it was a long shot, and I am so thankful I got a table!  The cocktails were expertly crafted and delicious, the menu touched on something for every palate, and the service was impeccable. I have not had a meal this good in a very long time-I had the poutine and manchego/chorizo stuffed bacon wrapped dates to start, followed by pastrami crusted duck, and finished with the malted chocolate pot au crème. I then rolled home in a food drunk stupor, and laid on my bed asking God why the food was so good that I was forced to eat all of it.  Go here, it's worth the price-your eyes, mouth, nose and tummy will be so happy with you."}
{"text":"Went back for 45 oz ribeye and was blown away the second time around. Would definitely return again. First time may have been a fluke since they were relatively new. Highly recommend the Tartare."}
{"text":"I went to dinner at Meat and Potatoes expecting great things given all the reviews.  I was very disappointed.  The fried pickles were average at best.  The sauce container was so small, the pickles didn't fit inside to dip.  The fall salad wasn't bad if you ignore the abundance of radicchio lettuce and too much dressing and soggy pears. To cap off the night my flat iron steak came after waiting 1 hour.  The mushrooms and onions were a nice addition.  The steak was cooked perfectly at medium-rare but was definitely lacking flavor.  The french fries which the hostess raved about were small pieces of potatoes (nothing special - D+).    To charge $28 for a flat iron steak and a potato side dish is on the high side. It definitely needed a green vegetable.  I can get a nice strip steak for $30+ at McCormick and Schmick or Grand Concourse or even a basic ribeye for $28 at the Cheesecake factory.  For $40+ Morton's, Ruth Chris or Capital Grille is more appealing.  They offer a 28 ounce ribeye for 2 for $58.  Why not offer a smaller version for 1.    They need bread for the meals and ice cubes for the warm water.  Glasses for iced tea are too small.  I didn't bother asking about desert, I just wanted to get out of there!  The music had a loud repetitive beat.    I do have to say the burgers looked really good.  For some reason they don't open for lunch on Monday and Tuesdays."}
{"text":"Solid across the board. Mostly hits. As mentioned many times, the bone marrow is unique and very nice. Nothing like buttering your bread with some marrow. The pig ear app wasn't a favorite. Wasn't as crisp as I thought and a touch sweet. Regardless, still unique.  Drinks were very good, and the service was great. Entrees were all on point. No huge standouts from our party, but clean plates all around. Luckily room was saved for some shared desserts as well because they were all excellent. If staying downtown, make a reservation and give it a shot."}
{"text":"So, I came here while on a business trip. I didn't choose the place, a colleague of mine did. When I heard the name of the restaurant I cringed a bit inside. I am not the type who can eat a lot of meat or potatoes. He insisted it was good, and he was right.   I love the decor and ambiance of the place. Everyone was super nice and funky. Funky in a good way. Cute clothes, hairstyles, and style overall. I loved it. The seats were a little weird. We were seated in the main dining area near the fireplace. When I sat I did NOT expect to sink as hard as I did. As a shorty, the seating was brutal.   We ordered so much it is hard to list it all. Out of what we ordered, I like the charcuterie board, and some dates wrapped in bacon (can't remember the name) but it was something you could write home about. We also ordered some pork bellies, and some other random things that weren't as memorable. We were also going to get bone marrow, but since we also ordered the HUGE Meat & Potatoes for Two which comes WITH a huge thing of bone marrow we decided not too.   The meat was awesome! We ordered medium rare, I think they wanted rare (I was with two people from France), but I think that style is a bit too \"blue\" for me. It still took about 45 minutes to come out. But with all the other food we ordered it was a quick and easy wait. I was so full at the end of the meal, but we still did order dessert. I think if it weren't for being embarrassed in front of my colleagues, I would have totally bent over and slumped home. My stomach was that full.   If I were in pittsburgh, I'd love to come for brunch. :) Next time, I'll still try to make a pitstop here :D"}
{"text":"This is one of my regular go-to brunch places in town.  It can sometimes be hard to get a reservations but sometimes I have luck walking in and getting a seat at the bar.  My favorite part is the bloody mary bar! They have a choice of several infused tequilas or vodkas and a wide range of accoutrements that you can add to create your own masterpiece (as you can see from some of my photos here).  I particularly love the shrimp and bacon options.  As far as entrees go, I love how they regularly change up their menu so there's always something new to try.  I've tried several items on their brunch menu and I haven't had a bad thing yet and the portions are always quite generous and the prices reasonable.  The service is also very attentive.  The only thing I don't like is the choice of music the dj plays at brunch which often sounds like late nigh club music rather than brunch music, though at least they keep the volume to a reasonable level so it's not too bothersome."}
{"text":"Excellent service! This place is pretty top notch in my eyes! Our waiter was so attentive and the atmosphere was very lovely! The bone marrow looked unique as well. I had the cobb salad and it was pretty big for me. I will be coming back and Thank you for such a great experience!!"}
{"text":"Had a fantastic dinner here last week. One of the best cocktail bars in the city, bartenders were great. Overall service was excellent as well as the food.  Cost was well worth it. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very mediocre brunch. I would give dinner 3 stars not two. I like the bar and the drinks are good, the food just doesn't quite do it for me."}
{"text":"Always been a decent place, not the cheapest place in town but relatively consistent. I have been in a few times and ordered a few items off the menu. My last visit I ordered their huge tomahawk steak a 45oz rib eye, Cooking time took longer then expected, however for a steak this size it is definitely understandable. It's hard to comment too much when people get it right! Here is a photo of said steak! It was larger than my head.   Only downside, there is normally a homeless man that bums around outside, sometimes has an unpleasant smell."}
{"text":"Very chill place to have a great brunch! Chicken and waffles were amazing!!! Sweet with a hit of spice! Juicy chicken! Big portion. Bread with rhubarb jam and goat butter was awesome!!! Great music!"}
{"text":"Wandering down the street a few hours before our show, two friends of mine and I decide to try to get into this place on a Friday night with no reservations. Walking in carefully, my friend nervously goes up to the hostess stand and asks \"how stupid is it to try and get a table for three with no reservation?\". Smiling, the host said we could either sit outside on the patio (plenty of seats because there was a slight chill in the air) or he could find three seats at the bar for us. We took a chance and chose the table, and were seated promptly.   The service was a little slow to start with, but quickly learned that our server had a zillion other tables and was taking care of the whole patio, which filled quickly with other diners willing to take a chance in chilly air. She was very helpful with suggestions, and ultimately our group ended up with a few apps, some flatbreads and an entree. I'll break them all down by below.  Devils on horseback (on snack menu): A weird take on pigs in a blanket that involved what I think is spicy mayo and super sweet pulled pork wrapped in bacon. I didn't like it at all, but my friends were fans.   Mac and cheese (on appetizer menu): Very yummy cheese sauce with this Mac, although I do prefer mine to be baked and not just thrown together in a pot. The chorizo really added to it and the crumbly top was a nice texture addition too!  Bone marrow (on appetizer menu):  Three ginormous bones of garlicky fatty goodness. The fixings were what made this so great. The only thing that was unpleasant was that when it cooled it became not so good. Not enough bread to start with in the first place, and took forever to get more.   The salty pig (Flatbread): Salty as ever but good as hell. My friend let me try a piece and it definitely lived up to its name.   Short rib Flatbread: Very delicious and everything I wanted it to be. It was a bit messy to eat, but I didn't care and dove right in.  Wagyu Steak & Pickles: My friend really enjoyed this and his steak was cooked perfectly. It was served on a long wooden plank, which I think is a little ridiculous, but he liked the kimchi and all the picked veggies that came with it.   The service ended up being pretty great by the end, and the food was good, but I wouldn't say it was the best meal I've ever had. When I'm paying those prices, I expect it to blow me away. I'd go back to the the happy hour snack specials sometime, but get dinner elsewhere."}
{"text":"I really like this place however I am disappointed that they changed the menu a little. I loved the steak with avocado but now it is different and doesn't taste as good. Cocktails are also good"}
{"text":"One of my favorite high end restaurants in town. It can be hard to get a reservation, but several times we were able to sit at the bar quite easily and enjoy dinner or drinks while watching the awesome bartenders create their complicated drinks!   Try the fried Brussels, a great bar snack even if you think you hate brussel sprouts!"}
{"text":"M&P's newer sister restaurant, Butcher & Rye, had a wait so we walked right over and got seated after a really short wait. No worries, I enjoy original restaurants to get an idea of what this Pittsburg restaurant family has to offer.  I would give this restaurant a 3.8 if it were possible.   My dining partner isn't as adventurous of a diner as I am so I didn't order the fried chicken liver or the fried pig ears that I really wanted. We settled on the buffalo mac and cheese instead. Great creamy gooey texture but holy cow was it salty!  3.5.   I ordered the lamb shank with cous cous which was well made and tasty. No gamey flavor and the cous cous was cooked well. A solid 4.0.   My partner had the parpadelle bolognese which I had more than a few bites of. The sauce was hearty and delicious, there might have been a little too much meat in the sauce which I know I would've struggled with if I had ordered that dish but to each his own.  My partner loved the al dente texture of the pasta but to me, the texture seemed less like al dente but more like perhaps too much flour in the dough?  Something was off but I prefer this to overdone pasta. 3.5-4.0.   We tried two cocktails, can't recall the names of them but I wouldn't waste any money on cocktails there again. Perhaps I'm spoiled since I've had some really superior cocktails back home in NYC and internationally but the flavors just didn't mesh and they were not easy to drink.   The staff were friendly and unpretentious and decor was comfortable and inviting. Price wise, I'd say they were on point. Overall, M&P would be a place I'd visit again and try different dishes if I found myself in the neighborhood and hungry but I didn't like it as much as I had hoped."}
{"text":"This place is great! The cocktails are wonderful, and I am a huge fan of the bloody mary bar during brunch. The only thing that was weird is when I wanted to bring in a big party of 7 people for Sunday brunch (calling months in advance), they were unable to accommodate us and we had to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"was here for lunch and killing the time before going to the airport. staffs were all nice and very well-mannered. they were polite, yet chill. I was impressed by the songs they were playing during my stay. the music genre was alternative indie pop from 1990's, like Blur and garbage. several tracks were from garbage 2.0 which was beyond my expectation. this surprising music ambience actually is the reason inspires me to write this review.  decorations and interior design were obviously eclectic with a hint of hipstery. but I didn't see young customers at the age around 20's-30's at all. probably because of the price. nevertheless, I was seated next to a 60yr old couple, whom just met through online dating, presumably. being by myself and dropping my ears at their conversations was definitely enjoyable at its best.  oh, hm, about the food, I got horseback riding for snack and mussels for lunch. horseback riding was a bit too sweet in a weird way for my tongue. i left the dates untouched but ate the entire unknown stuffing (it tastes like pork) and bacons and sauce. hm yumm.  the mussels were incredible tasty. however, I got a plane to catch. thus, imma end my review, and it is also because I can. besides, a lot of people mentioned it already.  hope your experience at meat and potatoes is going great like mine."}
{"text":"When I heard that there was a place serving poutine in Pittsburgh, which I visit on a regular basis, I was all over it. My group came in late-ish on a Saturday night ready to ravage some of that Canadian delicacy, plus whatever else we could get our mitts on. Overall, the kitchen is sending out some pretty amazing food, but there are some kinks to iron out. Service seemed a little frazzled and slow; one friend's burger was underdone (not sure if that was the kitchen or our server's fault); and the crab banh mi was more like a crab po' boy, and a little light on the crab. Otherwise, we were really happy with our food. The poutine disappeared in a heartbeat, my ricotta gnocchi were the fluffiest and tastiest I've ever had, and another friend's chicken wings were very flavorful. Prices are right, and the French bistro atmosphere is proper. I am definitely willing to tack on a fifth star if they deal with the  hiccups."}
{"text":"If you ever need somewhere to go on a Monday night for a late night bite, an excellent hand-crafted drink and sweet tunes, Meat and Potatoes is the place to be."}
{"text":"Meat & Potatoes is the kinda place that has been popping up across the country. A cozy space where friends sit and rediscover classic dishes with a new twist. Fried pickles served with a creamy aoli and sweet bread tacos with a pickled cabbage show more of the breadth of menu. While the food is more of the style of comfort food it still is one of the better places to grab a bite in the city."}
{"text":"My favorite place in the city. I have been going there since it opened. I drive 2 hours just to eat there. Sometime just to eat and then drive back home."}
{"text":"Visited a month ago for anniversary. Food was amazing! Server was great. Host chewed large wad of gum throughout greeting and seating us. A little awkward I guess. Thought of this most of meal... Will go back. Like I said, AMAZING food!"}
{"text":"TRUFFLE AIOLI FRIES - boom, review done.   These are sooooooooooo good. The entrees are, of course, delicious as well and the custom cocktails are wonderfully balanced and mixed, but hot damn, those are some good fries! This is a great place to take a date on a fancy (and expensive) dinner.  I keep trying to give it four stars in my head because I feel like I've been too liberal with my stars lately, but nope, I can't do it. As long as you're expecting to spend a lot on really good food, then this is perfect.  Endnote: one of the things on there is a GIGANTIC steak that two people can share. It's like the size of the table! It's crazy!"}
{"text":"This place is hip and has some great offerings. I've been here a number of times and have to say the pub burger and three little pigs sandwich are my favs - not very health conscious but delicious.  Cocktails are a feature - love the vanilla sky. I tried an absinthe based drink once and though well crafted, it was a bit too sweet for my taste.  Don't expect to drink beer from a bottle here. Anything not in draft form uniquely comes in a can!"}
{"text":"Good meat and appetizers. I love the drinks.  A good place to go after the theater.  I have been here twice now and they have not been able to make me give five stars. There is always something missing. The first time the meat was not as good as I expected and on a Monday this week just the service was missing something.  On both times the door people were too busy on the phone. The food was better the second time  since we picked from the specials.  Both times the drinks were good.  I may give it another try since I like the set up and the location."}
{"text":"Things are looking up in Pittsburgh with the addition of this creative and brilliantly thoughtful restaurant.  This place can be and most likely will be a diet buster but is well worth the splurge every now and again.  I really enjoyed the service and ambiance.  I loved the cushy chairs and could easily have stayed for hours.  Miriam and I split some dishes and each ordered a Caesar salad.  This was a Caesar unlike I have ever experienced and was the best one I have ever had.  From the menu: romaine/ kale / house dressing / crispy pig ears / chicharrones / fried egg / pickled green tomatoes $10.  Oh my gosh.  It was rich and flavorful, the mix of textures was terrific.  The green tomatoes and tangy dressing giving relief to the richness of the chicharrones, pig ears and egg.  I am craving one right now.  We split the buttermilk fried chicken livers with what I believe was a mustard based dipping sauce.  Perfectly battered, fried, the livers were cooked medium.  These were as good as the reviews state and I wouldn't hesitate to order this again and again.  I think there were 8 so I would definitely split them unless your going to make a meal of them at the bar with a drink.  That may just be an idea!    We also split the Ahi Taquitos $14 with ponzu / avocado / jalapenos / ahi amarillo.  Crispy and absolutely wonderful.  I wish they were a little bigger because they were gone in too few bites.  These are very dainty but have huge flavor and a great balance of ingredients.  They're a little on the spicy side but not so much as to be overboard.    Lastly we split the special for the evening.   Braised pork belly with mole, corn on the cob, pickled cabbage, jalapeños and radish.  I loved this.  Loved it!  This should definitely stay on the menu.  The pork was cooked perfectly, it was tender, unctuous fatty dream.  The mole was terrific and I really enjoyed the 4 inch corn on the cobs.  I can't pinpoint the seasoning but I wanted more.    Our 5 dishes were $60 with tax and I really didn't mind a bit.  The quality and brilliance of the food was well worth it and I am excited to give a 5 star review to a Pittsburgh restaurant.  Keep up the good work!  I will be back to try more of this brilliant and interesting menu."}
{"text":"I made a reservation for Meat & Poatoes before a Friday evening show in the cultural district. The instant we arrived, we were sat, which started the meal off right.   We started with the bone marrow; I ordered the mushroom flatbread and my boyfriend ordered the porkchop. The bone marrow was devine. Paired with the crostini, red onions, and capers, it created the perfect bite. My flatbread was very good, though had a bit too much truffle oil. The porkchop was incredibly moist--probably the best porkchop I've ever had."}
{"text":"The BEST brunch in the 'Burgh, hands down!  For starters, FINALLY a Pittsburgh establishment has an honest to God Bloody Mary bar!  And, if you sit at the bar during Saturday or Sunday brunch, Bloody Mary's are all you can drink for $15.  That, my friend, is a deal.  Now on to the food.  Wow.  Here I go with superlatives again, but the shortrib hash with poached eggs drizzled with horseradish hollandaise was, without a doubt, absolutely stellar!  Rich, melt-in-your-mouth, succulent shredded shortribs melded together with creamy potato cubes.  Perched atop were two perfectly poached eggs whose yolks, when pierced by a fork, enveloped the hash in creaminess only surpassed by the final crowning glory of a zippy housemade horseradish hollandise.  Superb....I've been fantasizing about them ever since.    The hubby enjoyed a plate of chicken and waffles.  You may recall he ordered the same thing at Alchemy & Ale recently...Meat & Potatoes makes chicken and waffles the way they SHOULD be made!  Crisp, crunchy, JUICY, ON THE BONE chicken pieces piled atop a crunchy on the outside, tender on the inside cheddar jalapeno waffle kissed with bacon bourbon maple syrup.  Ooooooo....maple. Bacon. Bourbon.    We each had a specialty drink - me the Bacon & Egg - a blend of bacon vodka, orange juice, sugar and egg white.  The bacon vodka was a house infusion that packed more bacon punch than the Bakon brand I have in my bar.  I am going to try my own bacon infusion again!  The drink was interesting, but next time I want all that bacon-y goodness in a Bloody Mary!    Fond memories of San Remo and Monte Carlo meals always ending with Fernet Branca enticed the hubster to order a Kingston which included Drambuie and Fernet Branca along with pineapple juice.  He enjoyed it, but enjoyed his Shock Top Pumpkin Wheat Ale even more!  He IS a pumkin ale fan.  The brunch prices here are amazingly reasonable!  The staff is friendly, knowledgeable, professional and efficient.  The kitchen is top notch!  Meat & Potatoes is a PERFECT way to start a weekend morning!"}
{"text":"This place was in my top 10 of the year.  Food, atmosphere, service all on point.  The Pork Chop was outstanding!  I'd suggest you get good friends or a loved one and make an evening out of it."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch and while the food was absolutely fantastic, the service was pretty poor. After waiting to be seated (which was expected), we waited a good 15 minutes for anyone to come over and acknowledge us. Our drink orders didn't come until our appetizers did, and the server did not seem to know what was in most of the drinks. It also took her another 15 minutes to bring the check over after we requested it. While it wasn't the worst service I've experienced, it certainly didn't match up to the quality of the food or the prices of the restaurant. We'll probably return for the food, but won't be bringing guests here!"}
{"text":"I LOVED Meat & Potatoes so much I went for dinner on Friday evening and back for brunch on Sunday morning.  I made both reservations about a month in advance of my trip, and the pickings were already a bit slim in terms of the times available. Strongly recommend a reservation, as the place was crowded both times, even at opening on Sunday morning on a snowy day. The front of the house seems a bit disorganized, so after waiting for almost 10 minutes and the confusion of who would seat us, we opted not to check our coats.  The dining room is not super large, and is dominated by a huge bar. It was hopping at 8:00 on a Friday night. We sat at a two top- a tiny, round marble table on the front side of the room. There are about 10 of these in very close proximity to one another. While cute, they're a bit too small to accommodate the admittedly large amount of food we wanted to order. I found it a bit awkward to be so close to my neighbors (why not just have a communal table?) This is not significant enough to prevent me from returning, and I actually prefer more tables + less wait to fewer tables.   The beer list was extensive and well-priced, with options from $3-$8. We started with fried brussels sprouts, which were a bit lemony and covered in parmesan cheese. These were AMAZING. Even if you don't like brussels sprouts, try these! I ordered the lamb burger and my fiance had the fish and chips. Be aware that the fish and chips have such a fancy presentation that they don't look like traditional fish and chips, and my midwestern fiance was not thrilled. They're stacked individually, and the tartar sauce and cold greens top them, which created serious temperature issues. We wouldn't order these again. The lamb burger was delicious- cooked perfectly well, the house-made bun was pillowy soft, and it was very well-seasoned and flavorful. The fries were among the best I've ever had- even my normally fry-hating fiancee was fighting for these. For dessert, we got a cooked chocolate mousse that was delicious.  We returned for brunch on Sunday morning at 10:30, right when they open. We had to drive back to Chicago that day, and it was snowing. The place was totally full by about 10:50. Service was impeccable, and we liked the brunch even more than the delicious dinner. I had the chicken and waffles, which were extremely well executed. The chicken was so flavorful and moist, and the cornbread jalapeno waffle was the perfect vessel to eat the chicken. There were also four enormous pieces of chicken! It came with delicious bourbon maple syrup with chunks of pepper bacon. The perfect sweet and savory meal!  My fiance ordered the kimchee brisket with eggs, and he loved it. He ate every last bite, and hasn't stopped talking about for the last week.  In summary: go here, order everything, leave satisfied. You will not regret it. We are plotting to go back to Pittsburgh solely to go to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"We have been waiting to get a reservation here for a long time and dinner was phenomenal! I definitely splurged on the night but I have no regrets. I got a Caesar salad without the pork because the pig ears threw me off. But then I decided to get the flat iron steak and it was cooked to perfection just like cutting into butter. Lastly I got the Mexican honeybee drink to go with the lemon angel food cake for desert best choice I have ever made in my life. It is a pricey place but I will forever be going there for dinner with friends and family. It is definitely worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"I had my first experience at meat and potatoes last night. Service was slow, very limited menu with nothing outstanding to choose from. The pappardelle dish was good. Appetizers were not good, except the poutine, which was ok I've had way better. Very disappointed, and I'll ever go back."}
{"text":"This place does it right! The steak for 2 meal was incredible. Great ribeye, cooked perfectly, along with the best confit fries and creamed spinach I've ever had. My friends all said the burgers and collard greens were top notch too."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant. One of the best in Pittsburgh. Go lunch time before the crowd and the lunch menu is reasonable."}
{"text":"I've been to Meat and Potatoes several times now and and both occasions the food has been very good. Last night I went for a late night bite and some dessert. Given the late hour we were able to walk in and get seating, though this is certainly not the norm. Usually I have been given a rather long wait time if I just try and walk up. Reservations are definitely recommended. Last night was certainly a pleasant surprise and they hostess was friendly and happy to seat us right away.  On this occasion I got the charcuterie which came with several smoked meats, olives and pickled vegetables. The cauliflower was exceptionally good and I enjoyed all the meat. My only gripe (and this is nitpicking) was that the bread was large pieces of toasted bread. I tend to like  more pieces or toast points, but again, I'm just being persnickety. Yes, i did just use that word, I;m so pretentious sometimes.   The dessert was fantastic. We shared two desserts, a white chocolate panna cotta with blackberries and a rich chocolate mousse like dessert. Both were absolutely phenomenal. I really enjoy places that make their own desserts.   On a previous visit I had the Meat and Potatoes for two, which is a perfectly seasoned 34 oz Ribeye, Confit Steak Fries (which are perfectly seasoned potato wedges really) and the most interesting part, a Bone Marrow Gratin. It was my first time trying bone marrow, which I thought was good and matched well with the steak. My date did not care for it much (in all fairness she didn't care for me much either so I wouldn't put much stock in her tastes :) ).  Overall, the food here is very good, and I've never been disappointed. The only thing I really don't love is the seating. I always feel like I am crowded by the tables next to me. I have ample room to move and I don't bump elbows or anything like that, but the tables are just close enough to take away the intimacy of the small 2 seater tables. It's not a deal breaker, but the only real negative I can say about the plate."}
{"text":"The salmon was tasty, but the fried brussels were too salty.  I liked the spicy sauce on the fish. The marrow bones were not filled with marrow.  It was scant portioning, and I've made better at home. Atmosphere is louder than most.  Seating, fairly crowded. Bloody mary was just ok. Wait staff, fine."}
{"text":"Simply put, we were underwhelmed. Let's go in order. The beer list is pretty good. It took about 15 minutes for our group of 10 to get drinks.  The menu is decent, but surprisingly lacks a variety of meat choices for dinners. Appetizers were above average. The fried pickles were nothing special. The short rib flat bread was great. The tater tots are fries, which is just dumb.  No bread is given prior to the meal, which is disappointing.  I had the pork chop. It's gigantic. It was cooked perfectly but did lack seasoning. I had a side of mashed, and they were just ok. Overall, it was alright.  My wife had the red fish. She didn't like it, and afterwards said she should've never ordered fish at a place called \"Meat & Potatoes\". I tried hers and it was indeed bland....kind of like our dining experience.  This will likely be the most boring review we write. Sorry about that."}
{"text":"This place gets a 5 solely for atmosphere, cocktails and menu. Although what I ordered did not impress, I really enjoyed the whole experience.  Flank steak was cold, supposed to be? Sauce overpowered the steak. Would definitely get it on the side.   Salty pig was kind of a let down.   Atmosphere is 5/5"}
{"text":"Pros:  Very Good food.  Nice atmosphere.  Good menu.  I like the infused vodkas-the old bay was really good.  Cons:  Decent service.  Bloody Mary's were just ok  Reservations highly recommended.  At 11:15 on a Sunday we had to wait I've an hour for a table."}
{"text":"The brunch was as good as it gets! It was spectacular! I can't wait to go back! I had the french toast and it was excellent!!!!!!! My husband had steak and eggs and he was VERY happy! We'll be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Went there before the stadium series hockey game so area was packed with visitors. It required reservation to get a table on this Saturday afternoon keep that in mind if visiting on a high tourism time. On Saturday they were serving a brunch and not their menu you see on line. I was disappointed since I saw items on menu I wanted to try but was. It able to. My wife had the shrimp and grits said it was best she had ever has. I had pub burger with pastrami pork belly. Burger was good maybe too much not the kind of burger you pick up and eat a little messy but still very good. We shared and cheesecake apple crunch, not exactly what it real name. It was also very good. We would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I had never tried bone marrow before, and I was intrigued. When the waiter came over, I asked if bone marrow is something I could have on its own as a meal. He advised I order another dish, especially since this would be new for me. I went with the bone marrow and Caesar salad, which consisted of romaine, pickled green tomatoes, crispy pig ears, chicharrones, fried egg, and parmesan. Most of the ingredients in the Caesar were also unfamiliar to me.  My meal was excellent. Read more about my experience: http://www.ginapacelli.com/2015/09/14/pittsburgh-meat-potatoes/"}
{"text":"I have to update this review. Even though I can't give it more than 5 stars, I just have to. I love this place that. much.  I have to call out two of my favorite bartenders ever (of any place I've lived!), Blake and Mikey. The amount of awesome that they are is hard to describe. So I shan't. Just make sure you visit M&P some time on a weekday as they generally don't work weekends anymore and request a cocktail like the tequila old fashioned or the Honey Boo Boo.  Also, the kobe beef corn dog. Omg, that corn dog. Best. Corn dog. Ever.   The only reason I would consider not moving out of Pittsburgh (besides my boyfriend, of course ... ) is Meat & Potatoes. Now I'm sounding like the obsessive girlfriend, but damn y'all, the food is bombtastic."}
{"text":"I took a group here and we all were very satisfied with our food. My wife had the chicken and said it was exceptional. My daughter had the porch chop and it was HUGE and she loved it. Her boyfriend had the duck and he also loved it. Oh...and we had an order of mac and cheese which may have been some of the best mac and cheese that I have ever had. I usually don't like it when they doctor up mac and cheese with fancy stuff....but this time it worked. Why 4 instead of 5 stars? I had the pot roast and while it was good, it was tough. Good flavor but a few places it was too tough to eat. But, I would go back and just not order the pot roast."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with some friends recently. An appetizer was accidentally delivered to our table without explanation. We figured that we would eat it and they would add it to the bill at the end. The waitress came and took it away rudely. When we communicated that everything was okay and we were going to finish it and planned to pay for it, she took it away anyway while mumbling under her breath. We continued on with our night, paid the tab and went home. The next morning, my husband noticed that someone had added an extra $20 tip to the tip that we left on our bill. I will not be returning because I am disgusted at how dishonest and rude that our waitress was."}
{"text":"4 years and 700 reviews later..  This place is still awesome.  This is coming from the picky, non-beef/pork eater who can find a few items to love--think grilled cheese with chicken skin cracklin and truffle, whaaa!  The place itself is really open with a massive bar smack dab in the middle.  It's done in a more airy, classic style, especially compared to its train wreck Butcher sister. It's also exactly what you expect, topped with Edison bulbs, large, plush chairs, and the clean-lined bar top.  Not nearly as stuffy as it definitely could have been.  The most recent adventure to Meat and Potatoes was for brunch.  +1 called for reservations (make reservations, really), showed up, and we were immediately seated in the crawl space for parties of two along the wall.  I clearly first got my seasonal bellini on, which at the time was some type of pineapple. Ooooh, damn. There's also the bloody mary bar which everyone raves about; if my nebbing skills are anything, it did look a bit extensive and cool.  I, of course, ordered the french toast. Sugar bread and booze! It's brunch! But this french toast was different.  Sourdough but tender, served in a huge bowl, topped with almond brittle. It was almost caramelized and incredible.  Enough to almost make me forget the starter of granola and fruit.  The pile of goodness was topped with honey and a sweet ricotta I still can't get over.  The guy inhaled his huevos ranchero, but allowed me to carefully remove a pile of egg, salsa, and black bean that was just spicy enough for all the flavor it gave. Pair that with the roasted pork it was served with, and +1 actually cleared his plate.  Okay, so maybe I didn't have meat nor potatoes, but it shows how anyone can get into the newer wave of frou frou downtown dining with the original.  It's the only logical place to start (with a bellini or two)."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch was amazing. My fiance had the French toast which was spot on perfectly balanced, and I had the chicken and waffles. First off there's enough chicken to feed a small family, and it's made ridiculously difficult to put down with the application of the bacon glaze syrup.   My only complaint was there was more bacon than syrup, and after being charged  $1 for butter I wasn't too keen to be charged for syrup as well. The chicken was perfect, the waffle above average. The jalapeño waffle was good, but a bit undercooked and dry. Again, I could've asked for more syrup but out of principle resistance to being charged extra for a condiment I didn't request any."}
{"text":"Gastro Pub at its best!!  Great food, friendly staff and amazing cocktails.  Before a show, after a show, or really any time is the right time for Meat & Potatoes."}
{"text":"PLAN AHEAD AND MAKE A RESERVATION. I was visiting Pittsburgh for a few days and I knew I wanted to eat here, but I didn't think of making a reservation ahead of time. Don't be like me. Make a reservation before you get there. You don't want to waste your time waiting for a table, hoping there is a no show. Luckily, I called again another day and they were able to seat us in the \"back room\" within 20 minutes on a Saturday evening! The back room is separate from the main dining area so you miss out on the amazing ambiance, but you still get to order from the same menu.   We had a group of 4 and decided to order a bunch of dishes and share so we could try a little bit of everything. We ordered: --Meat and Potatoes: 34 oz ribeye with sautéed mushrooms, bone marrow, and (mutant) potato wedges. Highly recommend sharing this with more than 2 people so you don't waste any food. The ribeye was meaty, cooked just right at medium rare, flavorful, succulent and fatty. Cut a piece of ribeye and top it off with bone marrow for extra flavor and extra fat. :) --Caesar Salad: This salad comes with fried pork ears. It's delicious! Love the home made Caesar dressing too.  --Mussels of the day with garlic bread: Get it! There were 3 different flavors to choose from. They give you a ton of mussels!  --Lobster Mac: It was good but I wouldn't order it again. They give you large chucks of lobster.  --Pork Belly Tacos: delicious!!! The tortilla is so yummy and you can feel the pork crunch and melt in your mouth.   I love the ambiance of this place. It's a great place for a date night. Order a few drinks and some plates to share for a great night. I love the romantic vibe this places gives off. Round marble tables with candlelight centerpiece gives off an intimate vibe for a nice sit down dinner."}
{"text":"Just walked in the door.  It is 4:45 pm.  We have reservations for 5.  As we walked in, this young hostess asks us if she can help us.  I state that we have a reservation for 5.  She snaps at us that they don't open for 15 minutes.  Very rude.  Hope the other staff is a little nicer.  Stay tuned.  Ok, it seems like I can't write another review so I am going to edit this one.  The server , Aaron, was professional.  The food was excellent.  I had the pork chop and my wife had pot roast.  I never order pork but glad I did.  The pot roast was also superb.   Wine was good.  Will come back to this place."}
{"text":"It was about 8 pm on a Sunday night. We just got off the Duquesne Incline and found street parking after we drove across the river to downtown. We originally planned to see the Rubber Duck installation after dark before grabbing dinner. Thanks to a quick last-minute change of mind, we called Meat and Potatoes and were lucky enough to score an 8:45 pm reservation.   It certainly took a lot of luck to get this table. Once inside, we saw that both the bar and the dining tables were fully-occupied. The lively patrons and the dark and sleek interiors reminded me of a recent dining experience at The Girl and the Goat in Chicago, where I had my best dining experience in 2012.   To my pleasant surprise, the quality of the food here was comparable to that from TGTG. The bread with goat milk butter and jam was so addictive that I couldn't put down my butter knife. The seared duck breast we had was just as good as any I had in Manhattan, only at a fraction of the price tag at $19. The pierogi with the duck dish was good but seemed out of place. I guess it was a way to keep the meat and potatoes theme. The only disappointment was the blue cheese flatbread, where despite its inventive combination of flavors, didn't impress either of us.   For a restaurant this good, we were surprised to hear the dessert selection was rather average. We were so lukewarm about the choices that we decided to skip them all together.   The modern interiors and nicely-prepared dishes were more than enough to give this place a 3-star rating. When our bill came out to be around $50 for the two of us, the fourth star is much deserved."}
{"text":"Gastropubs are an up and coming experience for the diner and drinker :) but the concept of meat and potatoes in the burgh has identity, individuality and unique appeal. This place resonates with you well after you leave in positive vibes!   The decor is welcoming and warm with a successful blend of early 20th century artifacts and hip contemporary design and color. The menu is intense and truly a carb fiesta! Beers in the house are plentiful in selection and the service was outstanding. The server knows the brews, recommends wonderful ales that accompany whatever choice from the menu . This is now a staple for me on each visit to the steel city. Try it, you will not be disappointed! Excellent experience and meal."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for my birthday-last Tuesday. He made a reservation, told them it was my birthday and asked if they did anything special for birthday, the gentleman said 'yes of course we do'. Got there ten minutes early, the hostess did not even mention anything about it being my birthday, and sat us immediately (into a sardine can). The people on each side were about two feet from us.    Food: We got a 'snack' - the toast with goat butter and jam- very tasty and reasonable priced. Then we ordered the \"meat and potatoes for two\". The steak fries, bone marrow, and mushrooms were really good, but the steak was 70% fat, it was $50 for the steak. For $50 it should have been a lean cut of meat. We cut close 50% of it off because of all the fat. *All of the food took a while to come out but that is to be expected when you are paying a lot for a meal.  We asked for a box and the check and our waitress came back with a box, then she final recognized that it was my birthday by saying 'oh you aren't interested in a birthday dessert?' We declined. She did not even wish me a happy birthday or even wish me a wonderful night, just okay I'll get your check.   They have a lot of interesting foods on the menu so I might go back again. But I would never go back if celebrating a special event. Terrible ambiance, too noisy, it's not romantic, did nothing to make me feel 'special' on my birthday. (I'd recommend Morton's on Liberty for that)."}
{"text":"Arrived 5pm Friday.  Sat at the bar for 15 minutes then we were seated.  FYI the bar menu is the same as the restaurant menu.   Order the Tartare appetizer !!  If you are curious, order the Tartare, If you thought you would never eat raw meat, order the Tartare, If you think eating raw meat is weird, order the Tartare, If you want to experience something completely delicious and unexpected order the Tartare !!!  Did I say order the Tartare ??  You will not be disappointed, I can promise you that.   I went with three friends before a Play and they did ask us if we were going to a show and the time to make sure that we were not late.  Also if you have leftovers, and you probably will, they will hold them for you so you can pick them up after your show. The place was immaculate, the staff was super friendly and the food was everything I expected it to be.  We had the fried brussel sprouts they were cheesy and tasty and the mussels of the day.  The mussels were plentiful (enough for 2 people)and comes with garlic bread.  My friend ordered the pork chop which was huge; it took up the whole plate.  It was a triple chop and cooked absolutely perfectly. I ordered the Three little Pigs.  Panchetta, pork fillet, ham, swiss and an unGodly perfect egg atop.  You will be incredibly full and satisfied when you leave this place.   The drinks at the bar are reasonable for the Burgh and very, very good and the Bartenders are attentive. This place is a MUST if you are in the Burgh and like Meat,  and by the way Order the Tartare !!"}
{"text":"Always love the food here. Difficult to get in unless you're happy sitting at the bar. But the food is great!"}
{"text":"We stopped here after the Pirates game.  Around 9:30 we tried to make an online reservation but none were available.  Took the chance and showed up and to our delight they had plenty of availability.  We enjoyed Bone Marrow, Pigs Ears (very yummy) Salmon with black Rice and Pork Pappardelle.  All the food was delicious.  The menu is so interesting. I would take off 1/2 a star for the slowness of the service.  We sat for awhile before we ever met our server or received our drinks.  Never received a refill on water. Our server, who was very nice, had a very large party in a private room and I think it was difficult for her to handle it all.  The other thing I would share is that it is very dark.  Good for setting a mood - not so good for reading the menu."}
{"text":"So we had been planing a visit to Meat & Potatoes for a few weeks now but after reading most of the BAD service reviews on here I was worried! We walk in abut 15 min before our reservation time and was greeted by a young girl who asked us our name and directed us to wait at the bar. We order a few drinks off the menu, they were good....  So we were shown to our table and my fingers were crossed that our server would be amazing!  We looked over our brunch menu noticed that it was a little different the the one we saw online, but ok.  K.C came over to our table and BAM we were off and running! She is truly an amazing server... Told us all about the specials and took our drink order, great personality and very tentative to our needs! She made great suggestions for food ideas and we ordered....  Food was fantastic and all 6 of us were very happy... I had the short rib hash and It was so yummy.... So I give them 5 stars and will be back to see K.C please ask for her when you make the reservation, you won't be disappointed !"}
{"text":"Always a good place if you're looking to grab a nice dinner with a small group or even a night out with your significant other. Have tried both lunch and dinner here and both did not disappoint. Personally like the porkchop or you can't go wrong with a steak  option for dinner. I also ordered the side of Mac n cheese at lunch and it was easily one of the best I've had."}
{"text":"Having been to Meat & Potatoes countless times, I recently revisited for the first time in over a year and was delighted to see that it hasn't missed a beat, despite the fact that the ownership has continued to add more hip restaurants/bars to its repertoire. The cocktails are still awesome. There's still an interesting beer list, a few of which are draft, but most of which is entirely in cans. The menu continues to change every so often and offer some great items including the mussels, which seem to have become a mainstay there, a mushroom risotto (awesome though a bit heavy on the parsley) and a pickled chicken sandwich with bread + butter pickles, garlic mayo and iceberg lettuce, which was just freakin' delicious! On an earlier occasion a while back, I had a beef sandwich that was a daily special and was about the best beef sandwich that I've ever had! While I find the atmosphere to be too modern and contrived to be called a gastropub as they call themselves, it's fun and lively. It has a speakeasy feel to it, though it's very open and visible, so it's more like a speakeasy that came out of the closet. The service was decent. Bonus points for the kitchen being open until midnight on Fridays and Saturdays."}
{"text":"Meet and Potatoes is a nice place in a great location with very tasty food. No wonder they are almost always really busy which may make it hard to get a table or quick serivce. However the food is always worth the wait."}
{"text":"Rude staff...cant even sit at bar with out being told  where to sit..OVER RATED. .BLOODY MARY BAR SUCKED..who wants capers to get stuck in the straw?"}
{"text":"Finally tried Meat & Potatoes, not sure why it took me so long! I gave it 4 stars because of the service. It was mediocre, nothing special. We sat down at 7:30 and had our meals by 7:42. I couldn't believe it was so fast. I must say the bartender was awesome...a true mixologist! Bar service was better than what we had at the table. We had the fried Brussels for an appetizer. They were delicious and the perfect size. I got the pappardelle pasta with bolognese sauce which I enjoyed. The pork was amazing and very tender. A huge portion too for $18, you can't beat that. My boyfriend had the flat iron. He loved it! It came with a potato pancake and sweet potato purée that was absolutely delicious. All in all we had a good experience and I'm excited to go back and try something else."}
{"text":"This was my first restaurant visit of the New Year 2016! And if this is any indication of what is to follow I'm in for a treat!   Meat & Potatoes.....ahh what a refreshing place!   First, I was quickly seated on a Friday! That's amazing in and of itself. The atmosphere is pleasant and since I was seated in a relatively private section of the restaurant it was perfect.....  The food not only looks amazing it tastes that way too... But I decided to indulge in the \"Dub\" burger and fries... And I had the \"Grilled\" bread with jam and goat butter for an appetizer. And as a beverage I tremendously enjoyed the \"Nino\" cocktail.   This is far from my last visit....I highly recommend eating here before a show, a date night, or just a night on the town!"}
{"text":"Now that you have to book a spot at M&P brunch three weeks in advance, the anticipation of the visit feels like half the fun. The meal itself isn't bad, either. ;)  The Bloody Mary bar is the highlight of the trip, every time, all the time. Grape leaves, sun-dried tomatoes, whole roasted garlic, sweet peppers, and every hot sauce on earth are just some of the accouterments to choose from when you take the plunge of building your own brunch time beverage experience. Don't be if it takes you six or seven minutes to craft your savory beverage/breakfast snack cup.  Now armed with two cups of booze and snacks, we return to our inappropriately small, round table to receive our meals from a despondent server. A great attitude is always appreciated, especially at brunch, in order to enhance the dining experience. A bad attitude is simply a missed opportunity. Admittedly we did chuckle after the server took a surprisingly condescending/undercover policeman tone after I ordered tequila for the bloody bar: \"IDs first, then we'll talk flavors.\" Aye aye, captain.  My dining companion made the superb decision to order the Bi Bim Bap. Its Korean spicy funkiness made for an incredible flavor profile. Perfectly cooked black rice, crisp cucumbers, and a sunny side up egg solidified the dish as a slice of heaven. During the ordering process I panicked and ordered a breakfast charcuterie tray. The small selection of meats, though attractively served on a butcher block, was salty even for cured flesh. The two deviled eggs were tasty, but not impressive. I noticed that this meal has since been removed from the menu. Good choice.  With a Bloody bar that's on fleek, and meals that consistently remind you why you're an omnivore, M&P is worth the wait."}
{"text":"This is a review ONLY for the burger.  That's because I love burgers. I seek out good burgers. In fact, the other day I was told a good chef in Memphis (whose restaurants is allegedly not doing well) commented he would *never* put a burger on his menu. That's a really silly idea. There are people like me who travel for work and check yelp for a great local burger. People like me read reviews of good burgers and then travel specifically to the restaurant for the burger. Which of course adds to revenues and grows business.  Meat & Potatoes is trying very hard to be a trendy gastropub in downtown Pittsburgh. Located in a \"new\" building the restaurant was created to feel like it's been here for years. They focus like any gastropub on good food and good alcohol, using every part of the animal they can. I visited for lunch, not dinner, but the burger was of course on the menu.  This was a very good burger. Topped with caramelized onions, havarti cheese, tomato jam and arugula, the well-proportioned meat sat squarely between a freshly baked bun. The bun was out of this world. A bite was an explosion of flavors. I would absolutely come here again for the burger.  The fries were fine. Freshly cut, lots of salt, and served with a small serving of ketchup.   Four stars for a really good burger."}
{"text":"Got the meat and potatoes for two which almost didn't fit on the table! The ribey was cooked perfectly the potatoes melted in your mouth as did the bone marrow.  The house made steak sauce was prefect for the meat and the mushrooms it was a bit tangy with good spice. Just a few things to take note of the dish takes 45 minutes to cook so don't come prepared to order and eat in 5 minutes but trust me it's well worth the wait."}
{"text":"We dined at Meat & Potatoes for Saturday brunch. I was eager to try their heralded ribeye and bone marrow but was unable to accommodate it in my scheduled.  We shared the Bruschetta and the short rib hash. Both were unique takes on two homey dishes. The bruschetta was quite unorthodox in that there was no raw tomato salad. It featured crostini topped with mushrooms, eggs, chimichurri, and goat cheese. It was very savory. It had a great spectrum of textures including crispy, soft, and creamy.  The short run hash was essentially short rib and soft cooked potatoes under an egg with horseradish hollandaise. I felt this dish was quite savory too, yet it had a more complex layering of flavors.   During Saturday brunch, they offer a build your own Bloody Mary at the bar. The service was exceptional and the atmosphere was just as good."}
{"text":"I've had the pleasure of dining at Meat & Potatoes for many different circumstances--I've enjoyed drinks and small bites at the bar, I've used their side-room for a large-party Friday lunch during Lent (sweet life, a fish sandwich menu), and I've had every type of ambience, from a bustling and packed house and a table of five to a slow and early night with a table of two.  I love meat and potatoes. My concern with Meat & Potatoes (see what I did there?) is that your night is entirely dependent upon your server; and, unfortunately, of the many times I've been there, I've almost come to expect poor and sloppy service. Is it really that hard to be a good server at a classy restaurant? My experience in the food industry is minimal (I waited tables at a sushi joint for about a year in high school), but I seemed to think it took more effort to be a bad server than a mediocre server...so why am I constantly plagued with bad service at this place?  Cue rant? My first time was at the bar, and the bartenders were more than friendly--one of them actually recognized me from his time at Embury (\"The guy who likes bourbon, yeah?!\")! They'll make any drink you want, and they'll recommend drinks that you didn't know you wanted. My second time was at a table, and the service was awful--sure, it was a busy night, but ten minutes to get water, followed by a half-hearted \"you ready yet?\" didn't really excite me into a good meal. Further visits are plagued with memories of a server that kept attempting to up-sell (\"Would you like garlic bread for the table?\", or \"How about  refill on your fries?\", which I guess could be understandable--but then, after asking if I wanted a drink on the rocks, and then charging for ice on the check? What? Does this parenthetical even make sense?) When asking about a cut of meat, or even something as simple as a good beer, I've been told, \"I don't know, its meat,\" or, \"Yeah, I don't know, it's all beer.\" I don't want you to think I'm complaining unnecessarily, or that I'm being petty with my critiques, I just expect a server that pretends to care about you or enjoys the job that he/she has.  In short, the food here is delicious. They make a burger with an egg on it (the name escapes me) which may be my favorite burger in Pennsylvania. The bone marrow is rich and buttery. The cocktails are delicious and the bartenders are excellent (a lot of them came from Embury and the Firehouse Lounge). The devils on horseback are perfect. The muscles are well worth the price. The meat cuts rarely disappoint. When I attended for lunch, the simple twist on the fish sandwich was excellent (that potato salad made me drool).  I just can't stand that consistently awful goddamn service.  I'll keep coming back, and I'll probably keep giving 20%, but at least I can bitch about it on the Internet."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, staff, and atmosphere, but definitely not for vegetarians or super pro-animal rights people! I recommend to any meat-eaters, and particularly those people who enjoy rabbit, duck, and lamb. I, myself, don't like those dishes, so I ordered the scallops and they were phenomenal. The cocktails list was super creative and had plenty of new drinks I've never seen before. One downside was the amount of space given per table. I wouldn't recommend to people who enjoy lots of space."}
{"text":"The lunch service was deplorable.  The food was just average trying to be interesting.  Maybe dinner is better?"}
{"text":"Well, as suggested I made reservations. However, to get a reservation at a 5:30 I had to make it 4 weeks out. We were about 20 minutes early so we checked in and told the hostess that we were going to be at the bar to get a drink, until our table was ready. My wife was exited to check out the Bloody Mary Bar for $5.00, that we've heard so much about. The bar tender proceeded to tell us that the bloody Mary bar is only for lunch, but he could make her one. So a Bloody Mary and a Jack and Coke came to $22.00 plus tip. Ouch! That was a bit more than we were expecting but we were out on the town and just wanted to have a good time and enjoy ourselves. So 5:30 came and went and we still didn't get a table. So about 5:45 I went back out to the hostess stand and asked about our 5:30 reservation. They told me it would be another few minutes. So we finally get a seat right next to the corner of the bar. The problem is that it was so narrow between the bar and my chair every time somebody went by they would bump into my chair or me. So I asked out waiter if we could move over one table. He did allow us, so that was good. So my wife is sitting against the wall on like a big long velour couch and I was sitting in a velour chair across from her. She was complaining how uncomfortable she was, and so was I at this point. Both of our seats felt like the springs were blown out and we were sitting in a hole. The velour upholstery was all stained up and looked filthy. The mirrors on the wall looked filthy at first, but then I realized they were just old pitted. With all of the high ratings, despite the tiny tables, I was expecting better. So as an appetizer we ordered the bone marrow and mushroom risotto. Both were very good I must say. For our main course I ordered the Hudson Valley Duck Breast and my wife ordered the Wagyu Flat Iron. We both ordered them medium rare as recommended by our waiter. My Duck breast was very chewy and gristly, even after I trimmed off what looked fat and gristle. I couldn't even find a piece that I didn't have to spit out after a few minutes of chewing. My wife gave me some of her Wagyu Flat Iron to eat instead. It wasn't bad but defiantly didn't seem like Wagyu beef. I didn't complain though, I just wanted to get out of the uncomfortable chair I was sitting in and go home. Our waiter asked what was wrong with my dinner because I obviously didn't eat it. So I told him it was very chewy and gristly. He said that was one their signature dishes and after talking to his manager, he took my dinner off of our check. The service from our waiter was good so he got a nice tip, but as for the restaurant, we were very disappointed."}
{"text":"I absolutely love coming to Meat and Potatoes, especially before a show. We've been here several times and always enjoy delicious cocktails and appetizers. The entrees are good but don't always wow me. I miss the duck preparation they used to have but still enjoy their mussels and chicken. Brunch here is hands down fantastic!! Definitely worth a visit when you're in the cultural district."}
{"text":"If you like meat, this is the place to go.....Very good dining experiences, especially when entertaining out of town guests when you have no Idea of their preferences.  You can find a wonderful dinner regardless of your preference.  They are very capable serving vegan to marrow."}
{"text":"Bad service, gross food, bad drinks, VERY $$$. Typical for Pittsburgh. Will never go back."}
{"text":"Great food. Okaish service (particularly the hosts at the entrance). Tables are too small and close to each other for a restaurant of this price--it is hard to squeeze in to get to the bench without dropping anything from the neighbors' table. But food really compensates for it"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, typically very busy on the weekends so call a day ahead for reservations. For a cheaper meal the three pigs is good. The curry mussels are delicious as well. The $75 ribeye for two is my favorite on their menu."}
{"text":"Trendy and expensive... but I knew that coming in. Made a reservation and walked in for dinner and saw a few tables open. It wasn't busy on a weekday.   Sadly, the bloody mary I had been craving was disappointing for dinner. You have to come during brunch to customize it."}
{"text":"This place was super dope. My boyfriend and I went on a Monday night after reading about it in the Zagat guide. It was one of the unique experiences ever. The fried chicken livers, duck paté, and kimchee salmon we all awesome. The bar was also crowded on a Monday night- great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Come hungry! When I travel I always to eat and a new place. Not somewhere I can go to at home. The name drew to this place. I was shocked that a place named \"Meat and Potatoes\" didn't have meatloaf, but I suffered thru that with an outstanding Pot Roast. I saw the Rib-Eye for two. Well I can't say here what I said there, but it was HUGE. This place is well worth the visit. Try the Kentucky barrel bourbon ale beer, it is out of this world"}
{"text":"I came here with my husband for early dinner at 5. We didn't have reservation but the placed was packed, fortunately a nice person gave us her table to sit at the bar. The ambiance is nice and upscale. They had the comfiest chairs to sit at the table! The service was pretty good even when it was super busy. I found the food good but not amazing. They also have big food portion size which I am not a big fan of. Overall it was a nice experience but not exceptional."}
{"text":"The Moscow mule that I had was subpar. Service here was slow and i didn't feel like I was welcomed at all. Being a 4/5 star restaurant, I didn't feel like the staff was attentive or nice enough."}
{"text":"This place is a great addition to the Pittsburgh restaurant scene.  It's been on my list for quite awhile and I finally got there on my recent visit to the burgh.  A friend and I risked it without reservations and met at 6, we were lucky and easily snagged 2 seats at the bar.  This place is small - it took me awhile to realize that the mirrors on the walls around the place were just that - mirrors and that the place wasn't huge.  I started with the Old Fashion and she went with the Brandy Buck.  Both drinks were delicious.  We both had a hard time trying to decide what to order because everything sounded great.  Finally, I was sucked in by the brussel sprout kim chi on the Koren Ruben - and boy, I'm glad I was.  This was hands down one of the best sandwiches I've ever eaten.  First of all, it was gigantic - I swear the sandwich weighed about 3 pounds.  Thick pieces of some sort of bread - it was hard to tell with all the goodness sandwiched between the bread.  A big pile of delicious corned beef, swiss cheese and then that brussel sprout kim chi.  I think I could eat that stuff by the bowl.  Not only was the sandwich massive, but it was accompanied by a huge bowl of pretty good fries.  And it also had some sort of delicious sauce on the side - I think it was supposed to be thousand island, but it tasted suspiciously like the sriracha tzatziki that came with one of the daily specials.  I didn't really care, it too was awesome.  My friend opted for dessert while I went for another drink.  Her lemon passionfruit cheesecake was amazing.  My wine was pretty good too.  The service was great and the food was amazing.  This place has earned itself a stop on my regular rotation.  Yum!"}
{"text":"After finding out we were heading to Pittsburgh, I couldn't help but be excited about coming to Meat & Potatoes. I have seen Meat & Potatoes on the Travel Channel and never thought I would ever have a chance to try this place.   This restaurant is decorated so nice! I love the feel and the atmosphere of the place. The restaurant is not big but they did amazing with what they have. In the center of the restaurant is a really cool bar area. It is definitely a hip place for dinner.  We started off with the devils on horseback which are dates wrapped in bacon. They were highly recommended on Yelp and by our waitress so we had to try them. Boy were they delicious. It came in an order of 3 and that was gone within 5 seconds. For our main course we shared the Meat & Potatoes for Two which comes with a 34 oz ribeye with confit steak fries, house made steak sauce and bone marrow gratin. This was so amazing. It is a lot of food for two people but we enjoyed every bite of it. I hope to visit Pittsburgh again so I can try more things on the menu!"}
{"text":"We did not have reservations, but were seated promptly on a Saturday night around 6pm. The atmosphere was alright.. food was delicious. Both my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our meals."}
{"text":"If you're looking for quality crafted cocktails, bloody mary bar for brunch, delicious chicken and waffles, or an excellent dinner - this place has all of the above. I recommend a date night at this location if you have yet to try and I also recommend the brunch. It is on point."}
{"text":"Came here for my 9th anniversary and it wasn't bad. Tried the bone marrow and it was OK. Not the best I've had. The steak was perfect and the ambiance was nice. The tables were a bit small but overall a nice place to eat."}
{"text":"I'm going to need to get back to Meat & Potatoes for another bone marrow treatment soon!!  That dish is barbarically delicious.  The menu is somewhat limited, and it took forever to get our food, but all told, a nice evening.  Wasabi mashed potatoes are very good."}
{"text":"Went here for my bday dinner. It was so fantastic!! We got the pate which is so amazing. Creamy and has the best flavor. Also the Mac and cheese is sooooo good. Creamy and crunchy and has pieces of duck fat. Incredible. I got the duck and it was so good. I lived these crunchy sand the sides it came with. My friend got the pot roast and thought it was very good but mine was better. :) defiantly don't miss this spot!"}
{"text":"Went here for a date night. I love craft cocktails and this place answers that call. Amazing drinks with a talented bartender. The food is not bad at all. Think fancy comfort food, hence the name. While creative, I did happen to think the food was a bit bland for my taste. This is  the reason for the three star rating, because at the prices they charge for both cocktails and food, you expect top end. I will be going back again though, if not for anything else besides drinks."}
{"text":"Sorry guys - I have to remove 1 star because of the lunch menu.  Compared to dinner and brunch it falls way short.  Also, this was one of my first food experiences in Pittsburgh that wowed me.  Since then, I've had the opportunity to dine in a variety of awesome places.  Therefore, I had to re-evaluate my 5 star reviews.  Don't get me wrong, I'm still a fan and will still frequent the restaurant!"}
{"text":"Belated review! Birthday dinner for 9 in their private room. We had everything (including a monster hangover the next day). Cocktails are pricy!!! Bring your carsh & your credit card. Mussels bone marrow devils on horseback - oh my! Mussels were huge hit. Pickles were a good choice too. Flat iron voted awesome. Pork chop ordered by hockey-playing bro-in-law was giant & envied. Burgers were all around tasty. I blew it & ordered the brisket samitch which was soggy. Shoulda had the Wagyu. Stupid stupid stupid!! The Langer had the duck & said it was delicious. The bill was enormous & worth it."}
{"text":"M & P was FANTASTIC. I had been waiting for so long to visit this place and finally made my way up to Pittsburgh. Staff was friendly and service was timely. The food was amazing. I specifically came for the bone marrow and it did not disappoint! The fried pig ears and the duck also gets a 10/10 from me. We also had a few cocktails, I had the dark and stormy, it was well made and delicious. If you saw M&P on food network and you want to visit it is well worth it!"}
{"text":"Always make this a stop! Great late night eats!"}
{"text":"I had a great time here. If you are eating alone, sit at the bar. I was totally entertained by watching Blake craft fine cocktails while I ate. The fried pickles are some of the best I have had throughout the south. They make the pickles in house and it totally makes a difference! I had a Sgt. Peppers old fashion, you have to try it, best ever! The aroma and smooth flavor where all the ingredients just Work together to give you that flavor that you savor long after the last sip was to die for. This is a bucket list drink if you like bourbon."}
{"text":"Wow.  Am I review 500 for M&P?!  Here goes:  Saturday night, the place was packed.  We started with drinks and here's what I know:  The Glenshaw was really tasty, but kind of had a hint of Fall with the allspice swirled into the frothy egg white.  Next up:  The Bramble: gin + blackberry + lemon = summer solstice, for sure.  Perfect.  The Steak Tartar was amazing.  Large portion highly spiced and a little sweet, topped with a smoked soft boiled egg.  The egg was not for me but the others said YAY!  The Mac and Cheese was ridiculously sinful.  Star of the appetizers was without doubt the Devils on Horseback.  Dates wrapped in bacon with manchego cheese and a nicely seasoned red pepper sauce.  There were four of us and our dinners came from all corners of the menu:  Duck for me - generously served and well complemented with a couple of sauerkraut pierogies.  Others had the pot roast, roast pork and pasta - everyone was so very happy.  Loved. The. Duck.  We positively waddled out of there quacking about our next visit.  Better get the reservation made and soon!"}
{"text":"I am very saddened to have to give this place a poor review. Mostly because of the wait and the food it just wasn't what I was expecting from a restaurant that has 4 positive star reviews. I was really looking forward to bringing my hubby to a great steak place for his birthday but I was just not happy with the meal.   When we first arrived our reservation had been for 8 o'clock but i asked to move it to 830 so that we can sit at a bigger table as opposed to one of the small roundtables. The hostess on the phone told me that that would be no problem in that 830 they would have a rectangular table ready for us to sit at and dine.   We arrived early and sat at the bar waiting for our table to be available I looked around and seen at least three or four Open tables at the time but I assumed maybe they had already been reserved for other couples. As we waited we both ordered an appetizer of mac & cheese and fried chicken liver.  It took about 15 minutes for appetizers to come out and by the time they did our table was ready. We grabbed our drinks and the woman guided us to a small roundtable I looked at her and said well we requested a square table and that's why we waited until 830 as opposed to 8 o'clock.  She stared at us as if she had no idea what we were talking about she said okay well just give me a minute. She came back two minutes later and decided to sit us at one of their 4 Seater square metal tables as opposed to the two-seater woodblock table. I didn't mind sitting there but when we sat down there was an awfully weird smell almost like mildew and the seats that we say in still had crumbs in it from the guest that were sitting there before us.   I wipe down my seat and didn't bother to complain. The waitress gave us menus and asked us if we wouldn't know what we wanted to order. of course after having waited for 30 minutes we already knew. We decided to get that 34 ounce ribeye meal for two. I was very excited about ordering the ribeye especially after seeing all the beautiful pictures on yelp about how tender and juicy was. But to my surprise when it finally came to the table and I tried to cut into it it wasn't as tender as I had first assumed. We ordered the steak medium and it was very pink on the inside so I knew they didn't mess up the cooking process. Once I had tasted it it lacked flavor tremendously as if they had just brought the steak from the store, cooked it up and threw it on our plates. I assume the steak in itself would be full of flavor and bursting with with with taste but it just wasn't it was flavorless and bland and the only thing that made me eat it was a steak sauce that accompanied it.  The mac & cheese wasn't too good either it lacked that very delicious cheesy taste that you get from most creamy mac & cheese dishes. I did however enjoy the chicken livers they were very soft and not too hard to chew but the breading kept falling off of each piece that I picked up which only defeated the purpose of it being fried in the first place.   A few slices through the steak I was so disappointed that I just decided to stop eating and just stuck to the potato wedges and mushrooms that came with the dish.  It was a Monday night when we went so they had a guest DJs come in and also a group of people advertising Pimm's gin liquor. There is another issue I had with this restaurant. The music should go according to the Environment. The DJ that they had hired to play music was playing it way too loud I almost felt like I was in a club even though I looked around and saw people casually dining. It didn't make sense to me at all. the free samples of gin may have been the only upside to that evening. I had informed them over the phone that it was my hubby's birthday soon but before we received the check we never even heard a mention about it.  Once I brought it up to the waitress she asked if we had any desserts in mind. I wasn't too excited about the regular food so dessert wasn't really an option for me. My hubby on the other hand really enjoyed the steak so he decided to get a dessert to maybe save the evening for me. the vanilla dessert was very delicious. i scraped the inside of the glass container just to savor  each bite.  By the end of the night after a few beers a cocktail in all the food we had ordered my bill was about $140 including the tip. I was very disappointed that I had spent so much money and was so dissatisfied I should've just stuck with my regional got it went to capital Grille where I have never been disappointed. Maybe this place has better options for lunch or brunch or maybe I should just order something else but either way I probably won't be returning to meat and potatoes anytime soon."}
{"text":"Must try this restaurant if you're in the area. The food tastes amazing, the service is great, and the ambience is perfect for a date night.   We ordered the wagyu flat iron steak, which also comes with potatoes and guac. Their sauce is very unique and everything just pairs so well with each other. We also got the mussels, which I highly recommend. Their house special that day was the curry lemongrass. The mussels were cooked perfectly and the sauce was so good. You should order the mussels with bread (extra $1) to dip it in the sauce since there is a lot left over. Their mashed potatoes was also good, paired well with the steak.   The only thing that could have been better is if they brought out the mashed potatoes with the steak together. I think they forgot about it and brought it towards the end (when we were already half way done with the steak). However, the service was great and they apologized for the wait. Overall, my bf and I had an amazing experience here and would definitely come back if we visit Pittsburgh again!"}
{"text":"Another awesome meal - the aged Manhattans were great, decided to give the wings a try, they were great.  Slightly smokey and the sauce was not very spicy - a bit on the sweet side with a hint of Bourbon.  Great service and lots of fun watching the bartenders work."}
{"text":"I think this place takes itself overly serious...when your restroom is in the hallway of a neighboring theater it's time to take yourself a little less serious and deal with what you are.   As a appetizer we had the Kobe Corn Dog (which was very mediocre {didn't have the proper crisp, flavor was off}) and the Poutine (gravy was good wish there was more cheese curd).  I was going to order the Bone Marrow but the couple next to us said \"you have to try the Mac-N-Cheese it's amazing\" so we did....it was really good. There is Chorizo and Pulled Pork in it so it is very hardy....(we were both going to order entrees but after this we shared one).  We finished with the Hudson Valley Duck Breast. The pastrami duck was cooked a medium rear and was delicious with the chimichurri.  The pierogies it came with were good but nothing special.  Our server was fine....with us! He was seemingly short with the couple next to us who (the female was a vegetarian) seemingly asked questions about every dish. You got the vibe that maybe he's been spoken to about this by his managers....i.e. quipping back.  Highlight of the night might have been the two Spanish guys (in \"wife-beaters\") who sat themselves at a table to \"just get some drinks.\" After two Corona's they left but clearly the restaurant did not have the proper procedures in place to deal with this....  (It shows I have 4 check in's here.....I've only been here once. Verizon network was having issues that night into the morning.)"}
{"text":"Read the recent reviews! If you do, you'll see that the overlying theme of many of the reviews is their poor service. This is also the reason why I'm giving them two stars. Service is just not good. For real.   This used to be my absolute favorite restaurant here in Pittsburgh. The atmosphere was great, the food was on par, and drinks were amazing. Over time though, their service has gone downhill so much, that I really don't have any desire to come back. I've actually left feeling embarrassed for taking out of town guests here, it's been so bad. Before I go on about service though, I want to say that their food has also changed over the years, and it's just, well........it's just not as good anymore. Gah, I hate saying that out loud. I really do. I want to like it still. But I've given Meat and Potatoes too many chances over the past year, and each time I've left sorely disappointed.   The real reason I'm writing this review is to share my frustrations with their lack of service. From the hostesses to the waiters, they are just not good. Sometimes they are not friendly, sometimes they're downright snooty and condescending, or heck, sometimes we don't get service at all and have to wait there for obscene amounts of time before someone actually comes by our table. Now you may wonder why I just don't speak up and say something, but I'm not a confrontational type of person. I'd rather just hurry up and get the heck out of there. Unfortunately, I always have this moment between visits where I think on the good old days when things were great there and decide to give them another chance. But, I guess the joke is on me. No more.   Whew, glad I got that off my chest. And clearly, I'm not the only one bothered by their lack of service. I guess you could take your chances and maybe get a diamond in the rough as your waiter, or you could spare yourself the likely possibility of getting a dud and go somewhere else. Either way, you've been warned."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner recently and loved it.  I had the Brussel Sprouts, Bone Marrow app and the Wyagu Flatiron Steak.  All of them were delicious and the Bone Marrow app was large enough to be a meal by itself.  Great ambiance and a great date spot.  Loving that places like this are popping up in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite restaurants back when I lived in Pittsburgh.  A lot of people went there for the trendy and lively atmosphere, but I always went there for the food.  I've tried almost all of the food on their menu and have never been disappointed by any of them.  My favorite was the duck liver pate.  AMAZING!!!  The wine list was pretty impressive as well."}
{"text":"This was an amazing experience !!  Daughter and son in law treated us for a lovely birthday dinner. Started with drinks an apps. Brussels sprouts, chicken livers, marrow bones and a fabulous tomato salad. Everything was great. Super duper server. She was on top of every single thing. With great humor. I had a delicious ravioli with lamb ragu. Oh my gosh was it delish!!  Each dish was super. Pork chop was huge. Godzilla sized. Duck breast and mussels yummy. And then a lovely surprise birthday dessert. Altogether a wonderful time. Will go back soon!"}
{"text":"I went there for my birthday with a couple of friends. I was very impressed with the decor of the restaurant and liked the ambiance of it. I especially enjoyed the chairs which were so comfortable to sit in. I shared the bone marrow appetizer with my friends and loved the contrast of the bone marrow with the accompanying seasonings. The main entree I ordered was the wagyu steak and it was cooked perfectly. I would give this place a 5/5 if it was not for the extremely late reservations that they offered me. Other than that, I would recommend this to anyone!"}
{"text":"Is there an option to give the drinks, dessert, and snacks a 5, and everything else a 3? If your primary goal is to grab a few drinks and small bites before/after a show then this is probably your place. The drinks were unique and delicious definitely worth stopping in for, but the main entrees were less than stellar.  A nice, fancy meal it was not.   I really wanted to like this place a lot more than I actually did. Is this place more hype than substance? I'm left wishing we had gone to Butcher and the Rye instead. We made reservations a few months ago via Yelp and had really high hopes! The sitting areas were super tight, and the plush high back chairs were difficult to move and get in and out of. We did appreciate how well the staff worked together to clear tables, and how the servers checked with patrons to see if they had a timeline to work around (trying to make it to a show etc.)  I went with the Roast Chicken (chicken, garlic sausage, marble potatoes, heirloom squash and broccoli rabe) and my husband went with the highly reviewed pot roast. For the chicken, there was a mix of flavors that did not taste pleasing. I kept eating, and mixing thinking it's probably meant to all be eaten together rather than one or two items separately. I was getting a flavor profile similar to sauerbrauten (german potroast). I will say, the heirloom squash in this dish was the singular bright spot. How it was dressed or seasoned (apple cider maybe?) oh so, good. I'd eat a plate of just that - five stars right there!  The pot roast was alright as well. We both commented the entree needed more pepper. No salt and pepper shakers available at the tables though. Some gristle was lurking in between the bits of meat, so you never knew what you were going to get. Was it outstanding, no, was it good - a solid good in my opinion.   Okay so dessert milk chocolate pot de creme (other options were a cheesecake dish, and berry lemon cake/sorbet combo.) This pot de creme was oh so good, with the perfect amount of chocolate with a luscious texture. It's so hard to get desserts right, but thankfully this one was done right.  Finally, we both went home with leftovers from our entrees. Usually leftovers taste the same or better the next day. This was not the case, sigh. The pot roast was again alright, but the gristle that was hiding among the untouched mashed potatoes was not appetizing. I gave the chicken another shot, and while the chicken just by itself tasted better I realized the offending flavor in the dish was the sausage. I can't quite pin what was unappetizing about the sausage, but it did not go well with the vinegaryness of the rest of the dish. I love sausage, but this did not play well with others.  We had a hard time believing this restaurant is under the same umbrella as BATR. If we had gone to this establishment first, I think it would be a hard sell to try others in the brand.  Last tip, parking. There's a few garages nearby that seem reasonable during non-events, but we happened to have dined when The Price is Right was filming in town, so.....that was $15 for parking. We've parked downtown before on a Saturday night and it was a few bucks, so this was a bit of a shock."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic! We got the Ribeye for two and it was perfectly cooked. We were initially told it would take 55 minutes to cook, but it came out in about 25. The au gratin potatoes have got to be the best I've ever had. They were creamy, cheesy, and perfectly cooked. Highly recommend this as a side."}
{"text":"I've really tried to like this place as it seems that everyone thinks that it's amazing, but I've been consistently disappointed. The food is okay, but often too rich in a kind of cheap mayonnaise kind of way. The seating was really cramped -- I guess they're trying to alleviate how difficult it is to get a reservation, but I haven't seen 2-person tables packed that tightly outside of Valentine's Day. We were basically sitting right next to the couples on either side of us. The cocktails are their redeeming grace, but increasingly there are a lot of places in the 'burgh for great cocktails. So, not a bad, but a solid 3 stars."}
{"text":"I went to Meat and Potatoes for a friends birthday dinner. We made reservations far in advance, so that was not an issue. However, it is connected to one of the theaters so it is frequently packed with the show crowd.   The ambience of the restauarant is really nice, it is a bit dark and small inside but is very cozy. I thought it would be a really good date place. It also has outside seating, but it was cold when we went so we did not have a chance to check that out.   As my drink, I got the bourbon smash which has bourbon crushed with mint leaves and berries and oh my god is it delicious. I have tried numerous times to create it myself at home with some bulleit bourbon, mint, berries and simple syrup but I have never been able to recreate it perfectly.   We got the bone marrow as an appetizer. I thought the presentation was really nice, the bone itself came out and had small dishes with sea salt, capers, and some other type of spice. It was presented with delicious toasty bread. While I was not a huge fan of the bone marrow itself, it went on the bread like butter and what really made it stand out was the garnishes to put on it.  For my entree I got the duck. It was presented in slices, and almost looked like steak. I ordered it medium rare and it was really delicious. My friend had the turducken special, and while I could not stop giggling at the concept/name, it was a really good special too."}
{"text":"We were very excited to try this restaurant and went there on Saturday night for my husband's birthday. After reading a lot of the Yelp reviews, I was looking forward to the food and was concerned about the poor service many before us reviewed.  Well as you may guess by the rating, neither the food or the service was up to par. In my opinion, one of the very best things a restaurant can do to ensure its success is to make sure their servers are knowledgeable, gracious, super efficient & personable. If I'd had that, I'd probably give the food another chance.   The most glaring failure during order taking was asking if we wanted bread or frites with our mussels and failing to mention when my husband said frites that he would again be served French fries with his brisket sandwich. Who seriously needs 2 orders of fries during 1 service? Our first beers we ordered off the bar menu were served in cans - that's an inexcusable restaurant decision that I wish they had made more obvious on that bar menu. Seriously, it's a gastropub not a tailgate!  Draft beers were not mentioned by our server and had we not read the board on the other side of the bar and done an online search for the beer's description, we wouldn't have known they existed or what they were. She had no idea about any of the drafts when we asked.  So many things on the menu were appealing we decided to order 4 items. We started with the smoked wings (recommended highly by other Yelpers) and the curry mussels. I got the feeling if we hadn't specified to our server that we considered the final 2 items to be our entrees, that all 4 items would have shown up at our ridiculously tiny table for 2 at once. When the 2 appetizers arrived at once we had to pile everything on top of each other because the table didn't have room for 2 appetizers plus 2 small appetizer plates. The wings were actually really delicious with a nice smokey flavor and turned out to be  the highlight of the meal. The mussels were nicely sized and plentiful but the curry sauce was sorely lacking in flavor.   Then our server disappeared for 20 minutes, stopped by to tell us she was sorry about our wait but our food would be up in 1 minute, then disappeared for 25 additional minutes. My husband found her scurrying by long enough to tell her to please cancel the rest of our food if it wasn't already sitting in the back. She disappeared for another 5 minutes and appeared with only my husband's brisket sandwich which came with more frites. She squeezed into the tiny space between us & the next table and informed me that my short rib flatbread had hit the floor as she was racing it to our table but that they had started another one and it would be done in 7 minutes. Not sure why the first one couldn't come out in 45 if it only took 7 to cook.   Neither the brisket nor the flatbread were very good and unfortunately our attitudes toward Meat & Potatoes weren't either by the end of the evening."}
{"text":"I love the decor of this place. Inspired me to put a chalk wall in my own house ! I've only had appetizers and drinks but can't wait to come back for dinner !"}
{"text":"The prices are a little high, but you get what you pay for. I was very pleased with the attentive staff, and the tasteful food! Also a very convienient location to shows downtown."}
{"text":"Best steakhouse in town. Hands down. I used to work there so I know how much care, creativity, and passion they have for their food. Oh how I miss eating steak tartare all night long in the back kitchen when the chef wasn't looking. Short rib flatbread is amazing appetizer as well. But if it's your first time, go with the meat and potatoes for two. I included two pictures of the steak tartare and the watermelon civiche straight from the back of the kitchen from when I worked there."}
{"text":"Awesome food. We were here late and they cut our server so the service was kind of a mess. Try to make a reservation a couple days in advance at a normal dinner time and I bet you won't have any issues."}
{"text":"Found this little hot spot a few weeks go through Yelp, and have been back twice since.  Unique Gastropub with welcoming, relaxing, and era representative decor.  The staff here is very friendly and helpful.  Indoor and outdoor dining, with great music playing appropriately in the background.  All of this is great, but secondary to the food, which is simply incredible.  Unique snack and starters including great fried pickles Mac n cheese, fried brusselsprouts.  Salads are amazing including one I had last night which was a mixed light greens, watermelon, jalapeño peppers, radish and a light citrus dressing.  Burgers are awesome, had a special pulled pork taco with slaw, pickled cucumbers and cilantro.  Amazing!  The fish entrees are great, and they have a bone in ribeye for two along with potato wedges that are a work of art.  I haven't had that yet, but have seen it served many times.  People seem very pleased.  This is will be a go to spot for me every time I am visiting Pitt..  One of the more hip & trendy places I have been to...  Highly recommended...  Reservations recommended."}
{"text":"Yes, this was our first visit to Pittsburgh, we loved the food, but wish we could of booked an earlier time. We ate at 11:30 overall the food was good nothing bad about it. Here is the link  & video to my blog to read my full review as I can't post any video's here on yelp lol   http://cierrasplayground.com/?p=1004"}
{"text":"Meat and potatoes delivered neither of the aforementioned, although there were plenty cockroaches and a rat to serenade us on our night out in the Burgh. To avoid ruining the hip vibe inside we were placed outside (we have a 2 year old and she's so. not. hip) where we waited and waited and waited some more for appetizers, some flatbread, and a ricotta that never saw the light of day. Clearly we ordered the most time-intensive meals on the menu. Although beverages came out as expected, we were quickly forgotten outside and left waiting until I made my way to the front desk and asked for a check. The server came out and actually asked if we were still enjoying our beverages after being told by the front desk we were upset (and beverages being beyond empty). Interesting. I asked for the manager and she comped the drinks and was quite pleasant considering the situation, but there's something about making my child wait for food that infuriates me. There is nowhere else in this city where I've experienced such lackluster service and poor ambience (when building a restaurant avoid placing your patio along the alley filled with garbage disposal units). Many thanks to our hotel staff for having Microwave Mac n cheese on hand to feed my daughter at 10:00 at night. We won't be back come hell or high water."}
{"text":"I went on a Saturday for brunch. I asked my waitress what the best things on the menu were and she was extremely informative and helpful. I finally decided on the brisket hash and it was actually one of the best things I have ever eaten. The truffle flavor was amazing and went so well with the melt-in-your-mouth brisket. I am so sad I am only visiting the area and cannot come back to this restaurant to try everything else on the menu.   The stuffed french toast looked amazing and wish I had two stomachs so I could have gotten it too. I know that they infuse their own vodkas and have a Bloody Mary bar which is really cool.  Love love love this place and highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Cramped.  Food was OK.  Service was great.  Good Bloody Mary bar, just difficult to get to and from due to the cramped nature of the place.  We were there for brunch, but we will definitely be back to see if we have a different experience for dinner."}
{"text":"My second time here and it was amazing as usual.  I highly recommend the mussels and the pot roast.  Also, get a reservation or your wait time will be lengthy."}
{"text":"This is just a super solid gastropub style restaurant. It's the first restaurant by the owner of Butcher and the Rye and tako, and I still think that, out of the three restaurants, the food is most consistently the best.  I have been here numerous times for dinner and for brunch, and the food is always decent and sometimes excellent.  I recommend the burgers, which are decently priced and done very well here.  Their tacos seem to rotate, but I had some delicious pork belly ones here awhile back.  I don't often order the main courses for dinner, so I can't really speak to the quality of those.  I like coming here for brunch even better than for dinner.  The main reason for this is their EPIC bloody mary bar.  When you order a bloody mary (which was at an *amazing* price of $5 the last time I was here ... I hope it hasn't increased since then) you can choose the spirit (vodka, tequila, sometimes flavored spirits, i.e. jalapeno or horseradish).  Then they just bring you the spirit and you go to the bloody mary bar to complete your drink.  Their baseline tomato juice mix is already very tasty, and then there are an assortment of hot sauces and spices that you can add to taste. Finally, there are SO MANY SNACKS you can add to your bloody mary, from the usual pickles and cornichons to cheese cubes, salami, bacon, and even grape leaves!  Since there is often a decent wait for brunch if you didn't make an advance reservation, my favorite thing to do is drink bloody marys during the wait.  Just don't fill up too much on the BM toppings, because you'll want room for the delicious brunch food."}
{"text":"Been there twice while visiting the city. Both times were magnificent! First, the space is very fancy urban farm to table atmosphere with many interesting concoctions to drink as well as a great beer list. Devils on horseback- delicious, sweet and savory bites of heaven...bone marrow-I think about this plate and my mouth waters! With the perfect little complementing additions to enhance the rich fatty beef flavor, it is like there isn't enough. I swear this would be my choice of a \"last meal\". Steak for two is what we ate both times because it was so impressive from other yelp reviews as well as in person the first round...you can't go wrong! A great date spot and atmosphere to get a little fancy but- warning that you sit VERY close to other people so not an intimate atmosphere but a great pregame place to get a full belly and do a little downtown exploring."}
{"text":"Well worth the price! Had the meatloaf, and it was amazing. The decor in here is really great, and the wait staff is ver attentive. We had a smattering if appetizers and liked them all. Huge portions as well!"}
{"text":"Went with my husband for his birthday lunch only to find out that after we paid $11 to park there that they substituted their advertised lunch menu with a lenten menu. The menu had one burger and about 6 fish sandwiches...which the hostess neglected to inform me of when we placed the reservation. As we are not catholic and had chosen this restaurant for their beef menu options we just ended up leaving. Since we literally only made the trip to pittsburgh for this restaurant we are now out the waste of time and money."}
{"text":"I visited Meat and Potatoes for a brunch following an evening of bachelorette party fun. The decor was very rustic farmhouse chic and cool. The Bloody Mary bar was everything a self-proclaimed Bloody Mary aficionado could have ever dreamed of; house infused vodkas, homemade smooth tomato juice, 20 hot sauces, meats, cheeses, shrimp, bacon, olives, pickles, horseradish. It was incredible. The whimsical menu had some wonderful options. I wanted to try one of everything. I had chicken and waffles which was pretty amazing. Others had pancakes and stuffed French toast which were big hits. We had an excellent time as fabulous food at Meat and Potatoes."}
{"text":"In PGH... 1. The best brunch  2. The best friend chicken 3. The best Bloody Mary bar 4. Nuff said"}
{"text":"I swung down here with a friend for a quick snack, etc.  We sat at the bar.  The food was good, but the service left much to be desired. Very slow, and my friend couldn't even get a basic cocktail recommendation.  In fairness, I think the staff were overwhelmed, as the walls were nearly bulging given how crowded it was.  Nice place, probably better at the tables than the bar, but not somewhere I'm rushing to get back to."}
{"text":"Two Martinis, Waldorf salad (bacon / walnuts / apples / grapes / celery / green goddess dressing / aged cheddar) and Mac & Cheese (chorizo / pulled pork / government cheese).  At the bar.  Perfect."}
{"text":"Ambiance: Relaxed, casual, a bar scene but perfect for foodie families. Snacks and appetizers are great! Warm and cozy atmosphere.   Service: Our waitress was excellent! I got the pub burger and she gave me an extra napkin without me even asking. Super considerate and great service.  Fried Brussels: DELICIOUS, smoky, balanced,  cheesy, clean and sharp. Best Brussels I have ever had. Fried golden brown and covered in Parmesan, perfectly cooked and not mushy.   Poutine: Not anything out of this world but tasted good. Compared to the Brussels the poutine is mediocre but who can turn down fries, gravy and cheese curds? Fries vaguely remind me of five guys which is a plus because five guys makes pretty damn good fries.   Pub Burger: Incredible and suuuuper good, it's a burger with melt in your mouth pastrami pork belly, an egg and sauce. Really really good and absolutely huge, this is the best burger I have had in awhile  Wagu Flat Iron: Melt in your mouth, like a fillet mignon but with really great flavor. Cooked perfectly  Steak for Two: Huuuuuuuge. Really good too! If you like steak ribeye and are feeling hungry grab a buddy and get this. It comes out on this huge wooden cutting board with all of your sauces and sides. Sauces and sides are extra but you will definitely have leftovers, we had our steak with confit potatoes and roasted cauliflower and it was fantastic.   Overall: This restaurant is great!!! I would definitely go back the next time I'm in Pittsburgh. It's casual atmosphere has 80's music in the background and is very inviting. Our plates were so huge we didn't even get to dessert! Moderate price points and an excellent meal for all to be had."}
{"text":"The hubs and I were in Pittsburgh for a few days. We came here after a letdown of a German dinner (my choosing). I should have listened to my husband and came here for dinner. We only had drinks and dessert, so I can't comment on the entirety of the menu.  The drink selection was good and the bartenders were very knowledgable. I don't know if it's a new trend, but I noticed that several restaurants in Pittsburgh have Absinthe on the menu. I had the US Absinthe and it definitely had earthy tones, just as described by the bartender.  The atmosphere was great and it made me want to stay and drink yummy cocktails all night. We probably would have if we didn't have a 6:00 AM flight the next morning. The food selection on the menu look great and the dishes around us at the bar looked delish. If we ever go back to Pittsburgh we'll definitely be eating a full meal here."}
{"text":"Amazing brunch. The bloody mary bar is like a five course appetizer bar. If you like meat, the cuts here are fantastic and cooked to perfection. The only downside is that the place takes reservations and if you come without one, you will have to sit at the bar (if you are lucky) all the while watching as tables around you are mysteriously empty. It's also a tiny bit too expensive, making it a special occasion place, not an everyday affair. For those of you worried that this place isn't good for vegetarians, they usually have something on the menu to satisfy those who find meat unappetizing. If you ask for them to make a dish (such as the huevos rancheros) without meat, they will oblige. While they do love meat, last time we went in, our server also reminded us that \"potatoes is also part of our name.\""}
{"text":"Such a cute place! They even have their own in house DJ! My friends and I couldnt decide what to order for brunch since everything sounded so good. I ended up getting the Smoked Kielbasa Sandwich and Im so glad I did! The Kielbasa sausage was very hefty and flavorful. We got the Pancakes of the day to share. That day it was pancakes with pear compote, mascarpone cream, and candied hazelnuts. There were four pancakes stacked on top of each other, and each was very fluffy and thick. They served the pancakes with butter and syrup, but my friends and I didnt use any of it because the pancakes were already delicious without them. I was just in Pittsburgh for the weekend and definitely regret not trying their dinner menu.."}
{"text":"I've been here three times now and I am not sure what the hype is all about. It was pretty mediocre all the way around. The ribeye for two was the biggest disappointment of my life. No joke. After waiting almost an hour and half for it to come out, It was 90% gristle and fat. Yes I know Ribeyes are more fatty. Ribeyes are my preferred cut of meat. This was not up to snuff. Everything was very gimmicky and trendy just to be trendy. This restaurant is constantly hyped up by everything I read online and by everyone, but after this third visit I just cannot see the appeal."}
{"text":"I recently met several co-workers for lunch and the food was fantastic! One co-worker had the cold fried chicken sandwich and the other co-worker had the burger. Both co-workers raved about their meals. My only complaint was that the food that I received (Beef Short Ribs and Grits) was served somewhat lukewarm. The flavor was great and would rate 5 stars if the food would have been warmer. I would have asked that my food be re-heated, but I was starving and didn't want to wait. Other than that, everything was wonderful!  The short ribs were like butter!"}
{"text":"This saddens me as I really loved this place, every time I come in town I come here. We came and was one of the worst experiences to the point I may not return. First, they gave me a hard time about a reservation of 8 because it was Friday... The place was not busy at all. Our waiter was horrible, literally never came back and he would get a drink for one end of the table and not come check on the other. When we got food he never once came to check on us. It took initially 30 mins to get him to take our order. So with one couple ordering the steak for two... We were told it would take 45-50mins... It took over an hr and half! Again it wasn't busy. First, they should tell you about that when you sit down. One girls hamburger get was over cooked and gave her a hard time when she asked to add bacon to it, my pot roast was overlooked and the gravy tasted funny, the devil on horseback was served cold and the waygu was dripping with butter or oil... Was horrible. For the cost it was horrible overall. To have a reservation at 7:30 not get your food till after 9 is an issue. Super disappointed because it's usually so good."}
{"text":"First: Make a reservation. Seats are hard to come by if you don't rsvp in advance.   Second: No kids menu, however, they offer flat bread cheese pizza, burgers, plain chicken wings, and pasta.   Third: If you love meat, well this is just the place for you! I ordered the pork meal...it was huge! Everything was perfect, from the side greens (full of flavor) to the hunk of meat itself."}
{"text":"Absolutely dynamite.  The bone marrow is a must.  Fried pickles and pig ears were spot on.  Fried chicken and spicy grits were very authentic. If you have to make a hard choice, get the smoked pork chop. Smoked to perfection.  Great place.  Congrats to all the partners for a super A+ establishment."}
{"text":"In summer 2014, our interns got into the practice of scouting out restaurants, then recommending good ones to the whole crew. Meat & Potatoes was one of the places they discovered. Excellent menu selection & service. Can't comment on the bar since it was lunch at a corporation that frowns on such behavior. Maybe after work some time."}
{"text":"I have been to Meat and Potatoes several times but had not been there for about a year. I am sad to say that I think this place has \"jumped the shark\". Same menu from two years back generally and the place now just seems a bit tired. All of those cutting edge dishes are now just me-too's. Nothing special. Service was lackadaisical. No need to rush back here."}
{"text":"We have eaten here 7 or 8 times since they opened and every time we are so pleased with it. We lucked out last night (4th of July, pre-fireworks, post-Pirate game) and snagged 2 seats at the bar - I'm so glad we stopped! We hadn't eaten at M&P in a few months and some of the menu had changed. I had a fantastic drink called Pimm's Blue Ribbon - I'm going to try to mimic it at home..it was so refreshing!  We ordered the fried pickles to start - they were delicious. Think slices and the breading was fantastic - I'm not even convinced they were fried b/c they were not at all greasy or soggy - yum!  We each ordered 2 specials - the Kobe Beef Hot Dog came topped with chili and mac-n-cheese with a side of fries. I had the Pulled Pork BBQ special - topped with pickled cabbage and a delicious potato salad on the side.  Overall - another fantastic meal at M&P.  It never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Meat and potatoes are as ubiquitous as mac and cheese. I think it's safe to say that this is the new \"trendy\" place in town. There was no wait, as I made a last-minute reservation for right when they opened.   The interior threw me off a bit - it's very plush, to say the least. I wasn't expecting it, especially since they share bathrooms with the theater, and they're more, um, pedestrian.   Cocktails were good. I had the Cane and Able (10 cane rum, Ardbeg 10 yr, lemon, vanilla, jalapeno, angostura). I was afraid it would be too busy, but it was pretty well-balanced. The soft vanilla and smoke from the Scotch really rounded off the peppery edges.   As for food, it was mostly good. The fried pickles and poutine were solid. I had the pot roast, which was very tender and flavorful, and went well with the whipped potatoes and veggies. My friend got their take on the Fish and Chips (country fried skate with yukon gold chips, malt vinegar aioli, mushy peas and pickled green tomatoes). It was an overwhelming mess. All the components were done really well, but the flavor combinations seemed very disjoined and overworked. Just too much.   We opted for dessert elsewhere, so I can't comment on that.   Overall, a good experience."}
{"text":"Great environment and service. Beer selection was below average, but the rest of the drinks were on point! Bar seating is perfect if you eat alone as I did.  I don't think you could order wrong here."}
{"text":"Previously I found the intake staff to be lacking a bit.  But this last time all was fine.  We had to reconfirm (my issue) for the reservations, and arrived at 5:45 and awaited our friends who came in at 6:15 due to traffic.    The intake was flawless; the waitress, new to us, was the perfect representative of this trendy place in the cultural district.  We had to wait 25 minutes for others to show up but the wait staff came around ever 3 minutes to check...   Orders done quickly; and the kicker was the question about the time of the show we were going to... so .. the checks came out just in the proper time to hightail it over to the Byrham for Sister Act.   Food was all excellent.  So, I've modified my previous comments based on this last encounter.  We are going to establish this place at the \"go to\" when in this section of the cultural district.  While I am sure other places are great, why not just enjoy the ambience of a proven venue!     Remember the Cabaret is only a few yards away inside and the provides even more even possibilities.  Noone ever comments on this but... the restroom was perfect, coat racks located just outside the restaurant, and literature for the cultural district easily available.  So -- go, enjoy, tip generously.  Roy"}
{"text":"I recently visited Meat & Potatoes for the first time and I absolutely loved it.  My girlfriend and I had a 5:30 reservation on a Friday night. As soon as we walked in the front door I could tell that it was going to be a great dining experience. The minute you walk in you're greeted by a friendly group of hostesses, and the friendly service doesn't end there.   Our waiter, Brent was wonderfully attentive, friendly and constantly checking up on us. My girlfriend and I shared the Macaroni and also the Fried Pickles, both were delicious. For our entrees I had the Duck Breast and she had the Pappardelle, even though neither one of us cleared our plates we were still beyond happy with our meals.   Meat & Potatoes is one of those places that you can't say anything bad about, at least I can't. The staff, the food, the atmosphere A+! I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Very good food. The venue is quite small so you will need to make a reservation or get lucky at the bar."}
{"text":"Meat & Potatoes is a trendy eatery located in the Cultural District and right in the center of Theatre Square. Parking here is extremely easy, especially if you go into the parking lot located on 7th Street (I think it's called Theatre Square Parking Lot?) The restaurant itself its bustling, especially on Friday and Saturday nights, so make sure you call in advance or use Open Table to make a reservation. I came here last night for the second time to celebrate my boyfriend and I's anniversary. We had a reservation at 10 pm, since we were at Benedum Center for an opera. Upon arrival, we were seated within 5 minutes. The ambience is lively, classy, and has a wonderfully energetic aura about it. Our server immediately came over and brought water. Since my boyfriend and I were extremely hungry, we ordered as soon as she came over. We shared the bone marrow, which was a decadent appetizer served with grilled toast, parsley and pine nuts, sea salt, capers, and pickled onions. It was delicious! The only con may be that it's quite a heavy starter, especially considering all the prime choices of protein you can order. For dinner, my boyfriend had the leg of lamb steak, and I had the adobo pork shank. My boyfriend loved his meal (he's a sucker for lamb) and it was a perfectly sized portion that allowed you to get full but not full enough for dessert. The pork shank was amazing. As soon as I tried to cut off a piece, the entire shank just fell apart. The meat was tender, a little bitter, and had some underlying spice. All in all, a great dinner. We ended up ordering the pot de creme for dessert and it was one of the best ends to a dinner I could ever imagine. The chocolate was silky and just melted in your mouth. The freshly whipped creme and crumbles added light and crunchy textures that perfectly complemented the chocolate. After a few bites, it can get a little too sweet, but the dessert, itself, never gets heavy. Service here was the right balance of hands off and attentive. Our server checked in a couple times to make sure everything was tasting right and brought us water right as our water levels were diminishing. However, my boyfriend and I were never interrupted when we talked and had the chance to just enjoy each other's company. Overall, I'd say Meat & Potatoes is a winner. It's hard for me to pick one con about this place. As long as you make sure you have a reservation, you're golden."}
{"text":"SO utterly pleased with my experience at M&P. We reserved with OpenTable through Yelp for an 8:15pm seating on a Thursday, so although we arrived about 30 mins early, we were seated within 15 minutes. i would recommend doing the same, as the other yelpers seem to have long waits otherwise...  Drinks--creative and delicious (my choice: Moscow Mule in its own self-titled copper mug)  Food--also inspired. i loved the devils on horseback and could've eaten another two orders on my own. Mussles tasted fresh and well-seasoned. the pasta i ordered was a bit undercooked, but the 3-meat sauce it came in more than made up for that shortcoming. charcuterie board was delish and enough to satisfy, but not fill 2 people up before their meal.  Service--attentive but busy  Vibe--industrial, cool, funky; great for an intimate group of friends or a date.  Can't wait to come back to Pittsburgh one day and return...  Walk to nearby Andy's at the Fairmont hotel for a nightcap, and enjoy the fab jazz trio and sophisticated atmosphere :)"}
{"text":"You won't find another place in Pittsburgh like this one! It is by far my favorite in the city. The drinks and the food are amazing as well as the atmosphere.    I typically get the devils on horseback to start which are dates stuffed with chorizo and wrapped in bacon and then topped with some sort of incredible sauce! After that I get the saffron curry mussels. Which are to die for. I've tried many other things and loved them all as well. But when you love something why question it?  Ps the prosciutto crusted duck is also amazing!"}
{"text":"We were visiting Pittsburgh and when we walked into the restaurant me and my friends were the only non-white people there. The hostess instead of speaking to us, even after we said we were next in line, turned to the white family behind us and asked if they had a reservation and tried to seat them, completely ignoring us. We found this behavior very racist and we were treated very badly, they were very unpleasant and did not help us at all."}
{"text":"I was part of a party of six that came here for brunch on a Sunday. Our reservation was honored and being that we were a little early, we headed to the bar for a cocktail. The bartender blended us fantastic concoctions from their menu.  I've seen reviews for the poor service at this establishment and I believe that the time it takes to make these cocktails is part of that problem. Many of these drinks are rather lengthy in execution and if there is a restaurant full of patrons and only two bartenders, drink delivery could be an issue.  We were sat and our server, KC, came by and immediately got our attention. She was attentive and personable and spot on.  My main course consisted of the Fried Chicken and Jalapeno Waffle. The chicken was passable but the waffle was incredible. Everyone at the table was pleased with their meal and we promised a return visit in the not-too-distant future.  Good job, Meat & Potatoes in downtown Pittsburgh. Well done!"}
{"text":"We showed an hour early for our reservation and most fortunately, due to the Pirates game cancelation, we were graciously accomodated- not always easy with a baby carseat! Our server started a little slow but gave excellent recommendations. Each menu selection was perfect, including two of the beverages we enjoyed- Goose Island 321, and a featured Watemelon Draft I forgot the brand.. The truffle risotto appetizer for $14 was my entree- I do not have a large appetite but it was more than enough for me and to share. Perfectly prepared-to die for! I would recommend it as a side to share for normal diners! It was beautiful visually, the aroma, the taste, and texture...perfection! The Wagu steak $31, served with sauteed mushrooms was one of the other entrees I tasted and was also great! The steak was beautifully tender and cooked to perfection. The third entree was also a winner- the paperdelle with short rib and Bolognese sauce. It was light and the noodles handcut, there were generous meat chunks  that were fork-tender. The atmosphere is uncluttered,  hip, urban- upscale, but the prices don't break the bank. I think this is one our best treats of the city in the cultural disrict."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to go to Meat & Potatoes for a long time. I have heard such good things so this was a place I really needed to go to. Lo and behold I was asked to a late night birthday celebration! It was held on Monday after 10.   We were presented with two menus. A late night menu and the regular menu.  I was torn. The late night menu was $5!!! And the menu looked amazing, mussels, oyster, patty melt, shake and bake chicken, and an assortment of flat breads! Wow, what a great menu and a great deal.  But would the portions be enough? Or was this a sampling menu.   I was hungry. I didn't want this $5 menu to turn out to be some sliders and a chicken leg. So I asked the waitress about the portion size. She said that they were small, but still good and made a shape with her hands that looked like a slider sized bun.  OK, I thought to myself, better go with the big girl menu.  I ordered the Kimchi Ruben from the regular menu. The rest of the party went with the late night menu, and ordered two of each of the $5 plates.   My food came first, and it was delicious. The bread was thick and crusty, and did not get soggy even the next day. The corned beef was cut to perfection and the kimchi (brussels sprouts) was spot on. Just enough spice and heat to make me want to try it again.   But, then the rest of the food came out. And let me tell you, that  $5 menu was no joke. The flat breads were so good. I got to try the greens and chilies flatbread. OH MY. The greens were cooked to sweet perfection and when you took a bite it was heaven, with that kick of chilies mixed in. Just enough to make you go, \"WOW\" but not overwhelming. The Patty Melt was amazing. Juicy, cheesy, and the bread was thick and toasted just right. The mussels were marinating in this amazing buttery garlic sauce that made you dip your crusts of bread in it, just to get another bite. So good.  (Can you tell we shared plates?)  My only complaint is that if the waitress wouldn't have told me that the sizes were small I would have saved some money and just ordered off the late night menu. But I was not disappointed with my order or all of the other dishes I tried at all. And it makes me want to go back soon. This time, I will focus on the late night menu!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is well suited for dating and the food here is good. The bartender was very friendly when I and my girlfriend visited. We ordered duck breast and it was well cooked."}
{"text":"Being as this was Meat & Potatoes I did not expect many options that were more on the vegetable eaters side. There were very very few options for someone who doesn't eat a lot of meat. But the meal I decided on was really delicious, a pasta meal. The atmosphere was OK, I was in a low table near the bar and next to the Whiskey Cabinet. The manager even asked us to hold a bottle of whiskey while he unlocked and re-locked the cabinet. The bar was filled with rude business men cat calling the waitress. Not very classy for the cost. I wouldn't go back by choice."}
{"text":"Rachel C and I feasted like champion eaters at Meat & Potatoes. We started with the mussels, which were a very generous portion. They were served in a peppery curry sauce and we received some bread for dipping. Then the kitchen sent out some fried pickles and brussels on the house - both were great!   Next up was the mac and cheese with chorizo and pulled pork (!!!). The cheese was definitely very Velveeta-esque (pretty sure it was Velveeta). Delish. I was so stuffed at this point that I really couldn't eat much of my main course. A shame because it was also awesome. Hanger steak with all kinds of veggies and potatoes.   Our server was great and very knowledgeable about the menu. When she brought over my slightly-dirty martini, she immediately asked me to let her know if it was too dirty. It was, and I appreciated that she recognized that right away. My replacement martini was just right.   Next time I find myself in Pittsburgh, Meat and Potatoes is definitely on the agenda!"}
{"text":"Note: By ALL means, make a reservation. A few months ago, we were turned away because we didn't have one.    It was a harrowing journey from Kay's Beaver Falls lovenest to Downtown Pittsburgh for my belated birthday date with culinary destiny: Meat & Potatoes. A fender bender on Route 60 did not deter us nor did the frigid temperatures. I was meant to come here, yesterday, not moons before, and we made it just in time. A phone call Kay made en route to M&P explaining that we might be late was unnecessary even though they promised to hold our table for another 30 minutes. They also knew we were meant to dine here.  Emily, our ornately tattooed server who went up, away, and beyond her call of duty to make this a gastronomic night of nights, knew we were meant to come here against all adversity. The glitter in her bespectacled eyes and her pixieish demeanor were simultaneously homey, reassuring ('don't worry, ya made it! i promise it'll rule!'), and magically stirring, as if she was a riot grrl/food fairy/carnival barker leading us onto a rollercoaster of protein, starch, and housemade opulence. The restaurant was dark like a theater, a theater of madness, wonder...  I believe, she wanted to test us, test...me. She saw me coming, months ago, I swear...in a crystal ball...  A ternion of Devils On Horseback charged towards us with flag-like skewers jutting from their armadillo backs. Honeyed, bacon-wrapped, armored like hellborne beetles, full of chorizo sausage, manchego cheese, and topped with peppers, onions, and a red sauce reminiscent of ketchup that I cannot recall the name of, I finished off two, Kay dispatched one.  After quickly shellacking our first appetizer, I inspected my surroundings. Dish rags were napkins. Mason jars held food, candles. Water was poured from glass milk bottles. A large bar in the center of the room came off as a carousel for cackling, well-to-do adults who wanted very much to be seen. In what was a demonic, Dickensian Coney Island for carnivores and time-travelers, Kay and I just tried to survive in it.  The second appetizer came in the form of Pate, as M&P calls it. A duck liver mucilage is topped off with a sauternes jam in a sealed jar and served with toasted, grainy bread and a spreading knife. A rare treat, we rationed it, swaying with each gloriously silken, subtly sweet, crunchy bite.   Knowing that they must grind their own beef, I was compelled to try the Pub Burger, or was it compelled to try...me? The imperious fried egg was the first thing I saw followed by the flaky, buttery bun and the horseradish cheddar flap. The trembling, fat pastrami pork belly slab became noticeable only after the initial chomp. A \"special sauce\" lurked...somewhere within. Magnificently frizzled and exotically seasoned \"fried taters\" sat off to the side in a steaming heap. These are also offered as a \"snack\" with truffle mayonnaise, but when I asked to have the truffle mayonnaise, Emily gladly obliged for an upcharge. The beef, egg, cheese, and pastrami all colluded to create a creamy-meets-meaty alchemy for my mouth, and I savored it in lieu of attacking it. This was more than a burger; this was a game of chess, the crowning french fries and the exquisite truffle mayo acting as a respite between moves unti...checkmate!   Kay had a pot full of mussels that were likely the greatest and freshest of all the mussels ever noshed on. Arriving at an ideal consistency between gummy, gamey, and tender, the mussels soaked in a intoxicatingly beery brine that begged to be absorbed by our bread and were chaperoned by plump cubes of a bacon packed with flavors that were at once earthy and unearthly. Clearly, this was not bacon from a supermarket cooler.   We almost ordered dessert. That was until Kay said with a playful look in her eye, \"You know you want that marrow. Order it. It's your night.\" Emily approved, laughing as she headed back to the kitchen as if aloft on butterfly wings, likely saying in her head, \"Man, these groovy folks GET it!\"   Out came three bones colossal enough to have come from wyverns along with cups of gremolata, pearl onions, capers, sea salt, and more bread. With this dish, we danced on the edge of de trop, the filthy rich jellied lard nearly overwhelming us. It has been called \"God's Butter.\" After last night, I shall call it \"Satan's Tallow.\"   Lastly, dessert arrived in a dyad of mason jars. One was Red Velvet Cake, complete with a lone candle to commemorate my birthday. The other was a chocolate mousse so iniquitous, so profoundly profane in its sugariness, I coveted it, longing to snatch it from Kay's hands. Not even a cap of whipped cream was enough to cut its carnal cocoa essence. The Red Velvet held its own, however, its batter bright red and moist, its cream cheese icing adding angelic vim in an attempt to offer salvation from tawny, aerated damnation. Thus ended our ride and trial. It did not kill us. We are now stronger."}
{"text":"I wish this place opened earlier during my time in Pittsburgh. Gastropubs should be the new thing, and it definitely is mine.   My friends and I (party of 4) went for a really late dinner Wednesday night. I made a reservation for 10pm, and we were seated at a well-located table with super comfortable chairs. The server was very personable and attentive throughout the entire meal, and eager to make suggestions.  We started with drinks, my friend and I ordered cocktails (Blood & Sand/Thompson Daiquiri), and my boyfriend ordered a draft that was served in a cute little mason jar. The cocktails were delicious and well-crafted, but very strong and tiny, not to mention a bit pricey. (although reasonable for restaurants like this)  Between the four of us, we ordered the Charcuterie (3.5/5), fried taters w/ truffle mayo (5/5), fried pickles (4/5), Arancini (5/5), Mac-n-Cheese (4/5), Pate (5/5), The Salty Pig flatbread (didn't try), Bolognese Gnocci (5/5), Pub Burger (4/5), and Tartare (4/5).   I would recommend getting the Pate, fried taters w/ truffle mayo, and the Bolognese Gnocci.   I am definitely going back to try some of their steaks and their brunch menu as well!"}
{"text":"I always inquire how my Manhattan is made. Up with rye is not just the way I like, it's the way it should be. After Mike came to me on the rocks I should have seen it as the first sign something was up.   I came here on Friday for lunch and was a bit disappointed. I heard such great things, but unfortunately there were several issues. The Manhattan isn't a big deal but the wait time for our beers was a joke. It wasn't packed. The bartender wasn't busy. It was slow service. I was waiting forever.   So the drink was a little bit of a drag, the service wasn't the best, at least the food was going to be amazing right? Ehhh. My salmon bibimbap was excellent. I can't front there. The chicken sandwich though was underwhelming. The Mac and cheese was alright. And the fried pickles were below average.   I came here thinking this would be the one meal we got in Pittsburgh that cost a little more than anything else. It's a fairly inexpensive city compared to New York. Wish we spent our money elsewhere."}
{"text":"I love meat and potatoes. It's one of those places you want to show everyone. There's always something new to try! I highly recommend the three little pigs sandwich or Hudson valley duck"}
{"text":"A great spot in downtown Pittsburgh! My boyfriend and I had both been wanting to try Meat & Potatoes out for a long time and it definitely lived up to the hype. I ordered the duck breast which was AMAZING and he ordered the steak special. I am not a huge steak person myself but I tried some of his and it was the most tender, melt-in-your-mouth steak I have ever had. Such a game changer that I will definitely order it the next time we visit. Prices are higher but you very much get what you pay for.   This was the best date night we've had in a long time, with good food, great wine, and great music playing as well!! Our waiter was also fantastic and knowledgeable about the menu and explained all the desserts to us one by one. The staff were all friendly and seemed to enjoy working there, making for an upscale venue with a very relaxed, not-too-serious vibe."}
{"text":"Hmmmmm..... I wonder what they serve here?  Oh yeah it's right in the name but that's not all.  I love this place, great vibe, cool people watching and a very diverse clientele. You have your city dwellers, your city workers, your hipsters with their fedoras as well as trendsetters with their cool glasses. Oh and a lot of pretty ladies! Just Sayin'.   The menu is more than just your grandmothers idea of meat and potatoes. Take time to explore it, there are some magnificent choices on this menu. As far as the beer menu, diverse and good and the bar is exceptional. Waitstaff, bartenders are all friendly. I have never had a bad experience at this place.  In fact probably going back tonight."}
{"text":"Went at 8pm this past Thursday night with my husband and Meat and Potatoes was still full out busy. We got seated right away and I started off with a signature drink called Blood and Sand... which was pretty good (anything with Dewars is pretty good).   We got the cheese board for an appetizer which was excellent with sugared walnuts, pecans, dates and homemade peach jam. It was so good I thought my husband was going to get another board so he could eat that as his meal.   For dinner I had the salmon with black rice and my husband had the duck. Both were really good and for dessert we had their custard which was extremely rich... so you could only eat a little but...very worth it.   Our server was also helpful giving us details on the food and recommended a great white wine to pair with my salmon. The wine was light and spicy, and ended up enhancing the spices and flavor of my meal.   Over all, we had a great experience at Meat and Potatoes and we cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome: terrific food and great service. We had the bone marrow, hanger steak, salad, mussels with smoked salmon and the vegetarian pasta. All of it was fabulous, even the vegetarian ravioli, stuffed with fresh peas. It was really refreshing to see what is essentially a steak place offer really thoughtful and tasty light and vegetarian fare.   I would have given them 5 stars except for the fact that they have outdoor seating and kept leaving the door open to the outdoor area and flies came into the restaurant and became a bit of a problem. Put up a curtain screen or something if the doors are to be left open."}
{"text":"Only been here for Brunch and I am sold! I will be back. We had the Irish Benedict and the Brisket & Kimchi. My boyfriend and I shared. We literally could not decide which one was better. Service was great, always attentive and never pushy. We started with the Bloody Mary bar. It was very interesting but I don't think I know how to make a Bloody Mary as a good as a bar tender. But a great idea in theory. Also, they are only $5, can't beat that. As for the other libations, spectacular! Especially the Irish breakfast! I'm already planning my next visit!"}
{"text":"Now if you want a gastropub that has high end food and libations, M&P is the place.  Nice decor with nice high back seats and a large bar in the middle of the room. The bar was full and so was the restaurant on a Sunday night before the Pirate Dodger game, with many in team colors for both teams.  Some nice up beat music playing.   Service was on point.  We shared the Cobb salad that had bacon lardons, tomatoes, egg, scallions, some great blue cheese and a avocado ranch dressing.  A great start to our dinner.  For a appetizer we ordered the Lobster Mac that has some black truffle.  The mac was good, especially when you had a chunk of the lobster or truffle. Two people in our group split the Meat & Potatoes for Two (34 oz. ribeye, confit stay fries, mushroom argue and bone marrow gratin.  The meat was cooked perfectly.  The bone marrow was perfect sweet combination.  The confit potatoes were very good with a nice crunch and flavor.  The Pork Chop, ordered by someone at our table, looked great and was told it was top notch."}
{"text":"Having a rough day so far in PIT, but came here expecting to be amazed and wowed. Bummer. Wine was mediocre by the glass. Fried Brussels were fried into oblivion. Duck was very salty and flavorless. Now waiting on the roast chicken and hoping for the best! Won't rush to come back after some tasty meals I've had around the corner. Too much steakhouse, not enough modern vibe here.  Just sent back the roast chicken too. I'm not a bone marrow fan but that clearly seems to be the thing to come for. If you're not not eating red meat, don't bother."}
{"text":"If there was one place I wanted to try in Pittsburgh, it was Meat & Potatoes. As Pittsburgh's first gastropub, Chef Richard DeShantz knocked it out of the park by featuring a veritable montage of some of my favorite foods. And since the 2011 opening of Meat & Potatoes, he's taken over the Downtown Pittsburgh scene by opening up Butcher & the Rye and Tako, in addition to his bistro, Nine on Nine.  Meat & Potatoes features a bustling, yet cozy space with a central bar as the focal point. The GF and I met up with some friends and grabbed a drink at the bar while we waited for our reservation. After waiting an extra 10 or 15 minutes past our time, we were graciously offered a private dining room. But as we were about to head to our table, a perfect table for 4 by the corner opened up so we could enjoy the animated atmosphere.  Cameron's Kick [$10] Chivas Regal 12 year scotch, Irishman whiskey, orgeat, lemon, nutmeg  I started off the night with the Cameron's Kick, which featured smooth Chivas Regal and the kick of Irishman whiskey. The orgeat syrup imparted nice undertones to complement the scotch and in combination with the lemon and nutmeg, this was a surprisingly light and subtly sweet tipple.  Fried Pickles [$5] Spicy ranch  For our meal proper, we began with the fried pickles, which were spot on. A pet peeve of mine is when fried pickles come in spear form. Clearly, they're meant to be in chip form. These had a great crunch and a nice brininess that was accented by the spicy ranch.  Kobe Corn Dog [$7] Wasabi aioli, spicy ketchup, radish, sesame seeds  The kobe corn dog had a nice cornmeal crust that had a sweetness that was balanced by the richness of the beef dog. The light crunch of radish added some levity, with the wasabi aioli providing some spice. The ketchup had just the right amount of kick to provide some brightness to each bite as well.  Braised Pork Belly [$18] Carrots, English peas, pork jus, baby turnips, pea tendrils  On special for the day was the braised pork belly. So obviously, this was a must order and I'm so glad I did. The pork was unctuous, well-braised, and had a nice final crisp to provide some texture. Three huge hunks provided triple the pleasure. But not to be outdone, the English peas and gorgeous carrots had a wonderful sweetness that provided that countervailing element to balance out the heft of the pork belly. The baby turnips provided some starch and additional texture, with the pea tendrils adding an herbaceous element to each bite. This isn't just meat and potatoes people. Pittsburgh can cook!  Meat & Potatoes for Two [$59] 34 oz ribeye, confit steak fries, mushroom ragu, housemade steak sauce, bone marrow gratin   But the main reason I was here? Behold the hallmark dish - meat and potatoes for two. A huge 34 ounce long-bone ribeye is featured, though I'm fairly certain there was more than 34 ounces of beef on this particular night. Though I could have used a bit more of a salt-seasoned crust, it was cooked perfectly medium-rare. And more importantly, the beef cut and ate like filet. In fact, I don't remember the last time I had ribeye so tender. This was all topped by a mushroom ragu that provided earthy heft to each bite. The gratin provided wonderful texture to the fatty bits of marrow - easily a cup's worth of God's butter. The confit potatoes were perfect - a light crunch on the outside with creamy tenderness within. Perfect to dip with either the spicy ketchup or the housemade steak sauce. This dish can easily be shared by 4. Safe to say, there were leftovers, even for me.  Lobster Mac n Cheese [$16]  Taleggio, white cheddar, Doritos, truffle  You don't think I stopped there did you? I had to get the lobster mac, which featured the delicious combo of taleggio, white cheddar, black truffles, and yes, Doritos. The cavatappi was al dente and had great bite. The cheese sauce was a bit soupier than I typically like, but the earthiness of the truffle and the salty of the Doritos definitely came through.  Lemon Berry Pie [$7]  And since we were celebrating the GF's birthday weekend, we had to end with some dessert. The lemon berry pie was layered in a mason jar. Light, sweet, tart, and tangy, it was the perfect palate cleaner.  It's safe to say that Meat & Potatoes is a must if you're visiting Pittsburgh. Service was helpful and on top of things, despite it being a busy night as well. Not only are the dishes well-executed and delicious, I also couldn't believe the price point of the meal. It's not to say the meal was cheap and I'm sure there's the element of cost of living when compared to Philly or NYC, but I would have gladly paid more. The next time I'm in town, I know I'll need to check out Butcher & the Rye and Tako. But I know a part of me that will feel the urge to simply return to Meat & Potatoes."}
{"text":"The food was spectacular! The service was great! I couldn't think of a better place to dine!"}
{"text":"If you're fortunate enough  to not be seated in the cramped 2 top steerage class, and to have a server that cares enough to tell you about the 'specials board', then it's great. Off-times are best if one wants to indulge in the brunch bloody bar."}
{"text":"I'm so thrilled to have such a charming true gastropub in the city, particularly in downtown where new restaurants seems to pop up then die out quickly.   I had great expectations when first walking in - the ambiance had an upscale comfortable and quaint feel that made one fill right at home. The menu, which was an brown folder with age sheets of paper, had just the right amount of selections as to not overwhelm the guest with too many choices. I absolutely adored the cocktail list, and after 2 trips I have tried the Aviation (a twist on the \"traditional\" version which I believe does not call for grapefruit juice), the Sazerac, and the Old Canadian. The Old Canadian proved to be my favorite, meringue in a cocktail is simply one of the greatest ideas a cocktailian has ever had...go early 1900's.   I'm fairly certain that ever dish was concocted by the devil, everything was perfect! The mussels were fresh, plump, and they didn't have the fishy taste that is all too common in restaurants, and yes, believe it or not mussels really shouldn't taste like that. Next came the duck liver pate, served in a small clasped, jar with a couple slices of toasty, buttery baguette. Unfortunately not enough bread for the large amount of pate. Either way, the smooth, savory taste of duck pate on crunch bread is one I'll never forget. The pork belly potato skins were probably one of the best things I've ever had, though I can't it was particularly good for my health. You have to splurge some times? Snail and blue cheese risotto had great potential, though it was not as creamy as a risotto should be - it was a little on the watery side. I had no idea apple played a role in the dish, quite a minor role to say the least.  Overall, this is the type of place you want to spend some time in, which is exactly what I'm looking for in a restaurant. I could sit in the dangerously comfortable chairs, or the well designed, open bar for hours drinking prohibition cocktails and munching on the small bites. Seriously, you need to go."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink after a Pirates game! Drinks were delicious, service was adequate and our snacks were tasty! I loved the grilled bread and fried green tomatoes!"}
{"text":"Nice place with ambience. There is salsa dancing in the back area on Fridays and lessons are given early on.  Warm atmosphere and friendly ppl. Fast Service."}
{"text":"I've gone to Meat & Potatoes twice and ordered the bone marrow appetizer ($18) both times. It is definitely an experience I believe everyone should try. At first, it is really hard to wrap your head around the concept, but once you do it, you realize the buttery steak taste is something you can get no where else. By the second time you order this appetizer, you are desensitized to the idea of eating marrow and it is not as big of a shocker. The menu options range from appetizers, salads, flat breads, burgers, sandwiches, pasta and main courses. I ordered the waldorf salad and it was wonderful! It tasted like a fresh picked mixtures of lettuce, fruit and \"green goddess dressing.\" I also ordered the \"Meat & Potatoes for Two\" (34 oz ribeye), which I wasn't too impressed with for $59. I would get it again for the experience though, seeing as how it's a 34 oz ribeye to share and isn't too common of a experience at other restaurants I've been to. Although exotic, their drinks are not very tasty. I ordered the \"25th hour\" drink ($9) which had lavender agave in it, but I didnt taste much lavender. It was a dry tasting, bitter drink. I would be open to trying more drinks though. As far as going for dinner, the place gets cramped (tables/seats are pretty close together) and there are an overwhelming amount of people at the bar. Getting to the bathroom is a challenge when the people at the bar won't move aside for you, which can be irritating, but this would not keep me from going at dinner time! I do recommend this place to someone who is willing to try a fancier, exotic restaurant with a great price for the quality, but if it is a first time, I would recommend lunch time to genuinely experience the food and a calmer environment."}
{"text":"Over all a great experience. Food was very tasty and served in a timely manner even though the place was packed. Menu is the most unique I have ever seen. Very interesting spin put on some timeless classics.   Only negatives for me were the place is tiny !! Get a reservation unless you are okay with eating at the bar. Also not really my scene. Bartenders and everyone else in there looked like overly trendy hipsters."}
{"text":"Had a lovely dinner while in pittsburgh house hunting. Brussels sprouts app was delish with ample Parmesan cheese to add even more flavor. Smoked beets were good.. truffle fries were outstanding.. chicken sandwich was ok a little on the spicy side and fried. People next to us had what looked to be amazing pot roast!!! Plan to come again."}
{"text":"Hello Meat and Potatoes Restaurant, Can you please add seasoning to your dishes? Thank you.  (Note I went here in April 2013 so they could have turned over a new flour de sel flake and season the meat and potatoes but I don't think I'd take that bet.)"}
{"text":"3.5 Stars -- Best part of meal was the appetizer special with pickled wax beans and olives/tomatoes/fresh ricotta with grilled toast.  Very disappointing was that they brought entree about 2 minutes after appetizer platter showed up.  That's why did't get a 4-star rating.  Service should be on par!  The fresh pappardelle Bolognese was decent, not stellar, the pot roast was sublime.  The timing of the entree was the largest problem.  Though they were apologetic, no attempt was made to comp anything or make it right."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited last night after see Garth Brooks at Consol Energy Center. Garth was great.   As far as Meat and Potatoes, I will give the food it's due. Steak for two was great. We tried the Bone Marrow, and have to say it's not going to be on my bucket list. Restaurant did nothing wrong to it, just the texture and appearance doesn't appeal to me. Steak was cooked perfectly and the potatoes and mushrooms on point.  Now for why we won't return. The tables are not large enough to hold two waters and two drinks, much less the food that was served. We were seated by the front door and once food was served, the crowd wouldn't leave us alone to eat as they felt compelled to be 'funny' and heard. Additionally the atmosphere and vibe is more bar than restaurant. It is too noisy, and too crowded.  Good food gets the 3 Star, the atmosphere scores a big zero for me. Too much competition out there to put up with this place."}
{"text":"We came here per an out of towners rec cross referenced with yelp. From the start it was a bad experience. We put our name and number down for our 40 minute wait. We asked if it was okay to walk down the block to check out the bridges. We get a call 10 minutes after we left telling us that it's going to be an additional 30 minutes as our table was just \"given away.\" We were literally down the street so we walked back to ask what the deal was, something about her forgetting to put us on the list (yet we were there when she did Plus it was right next to the phone number they called us on...) The three ladies up front suggest we might have better luck at another spot down the street. But we were determined to eat here. So we stand around. 10 minutes later we're seated. The hostess really needs to learn some time estimating skills.  The meals: the French toast was good, not amazing. The candied bacon was a nice touch. The rancheros were nothing to write home about, pretty boring and not a lot of flavor. The chicken and waffles were about the same, there wasn't a whole lot of meat on the chicken so it was basically fried skin and waffles. I didn't try the pub burger as I'm not a red meat eater (I'm new to the meat eating game.) we ordered some bread to start as we were all pretty hungover from the wedding the night before, it took forever to come out.  The Bellini was decent, apparently the Bloody Mary bar is \"amazing\" so if you're into a boozy brunch bar, there's that. The staff were pretty lax, had to ask a few times for coffee and water refills. The space it self is huge, but there was a live musician which cramped it up slightly. That being said, it was rather loud, we couldn't really hear the folks at our table chatting. The bathrooms are not even inside the space itself, but outside to the back in the lobby. Overall, I'd slip it, but I think I just have higher expectations from places with 4 stars"}
{"text":"Meat & Potatoes was an obvious choice on the 'Pittsburgh to visit' list as all of the Yelp reviews rave about it. We got there at about 5:30 PM not realizing really how small this place is. Spoiler alert: this place is fricking tiny. Don't let the mirrors fool you into thinking there's a back dining area. It's just a reflection.  They couldn't accommodate us at a table, so we headed to the bar. The bar was packed, but I was able to snag one seat next to some guys in suits. Come to find out, the older dude was a complete ass and I overheard him saying some really mean things to the busboy (he was however nice to the female bartender....) If you're out there and reading this, I have 0 respect for people like you. Learn some common courtesy. Okay, moving on..  I ordered the drink special which was some kind of pear concoction. It had a bunch of different herbs and spices that made it sound bizarre, but it tasted phenomenal. We also went for the fried pickles. They were really good but extremely hot. I had to cut them up in little pieces just to be able to release the steam.  The service was great and what you would expect at a restaurant of this caliber. There was a female and male bartender and they were both on point with making sure everyone had a drink or food.  We had originally planned on eating dinner here but decided since we only had 2 days in 'Burgh that we were ready to try another place on our list, so we headed out after a couple of drinks and appetizer. If I came here for dinner and ate a full meal, I would probably give 5 stars too. Their menu looked divine and I hope to make it back soon to give it a real go."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the three pigs sandwich and pimento Mac and cheese more than some people were enjoying their dates."}
{"text":"Stopped in here after a strong recommendation from someone during my trip to Pittsburgh. Based on the name, it didn't sound like the kind of place I could show up in a suit, but I wasn't about to go to the hotel and change clothes. To my surprise, this place was as trendy and chic as could be, and full of after work professionals.  I sat at the bar and started with an order of wings. Turned out to be best wings I've had in quite a while. I then ordered the pork chop which comes with apple cole slaw, pastrami and baked beans. The pork chop is huge! But the meal is delicious. Everything was awesome and the only reason i didn't finish the pork chop was because it was so big.    The rum selection at this place was also awesome, which in my eyes completed what was an excellent experience. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Outstanding Gastropub in the burgh... Mussels are outstanding and if they have the curry lemongrass ones get em and a bunch if bread.  You don't want it to go to waste.... Unless it's your waist"}
{"text":"Handsome bartenders!  Indulgent bone marrow that was fatty, salty, herby goodness.  Sweetbread tacos and brisket sandwiches were ok but I won't have them again.  If I go back I will be getting a real meal.  It was super crowded on Thursday evening.  I don't like my coat hanging in the entrance area."}
{"text":"Terrific evening at Meat & Potatoes. We decided that the appetizers were more exciting than the main courses, so my wife and I put together a meal of the artisan cheese plate, mussels plus garlic bread and fries, and brisket mac and cheese. All terrific. The large bowl of mussels could certainly be a meal for one, and was a lot for two. The Diamondback cocktail was outstanding, with the yellow chartreuse and apple brandy adding nuances while letting the Bulleit rye shine. I'll be ordering these in the future. My one demerit, and the reason my review is not 5 stars: The tables for two are just too small. I admit, by having multiple appetizers, we required more than the usual amount of space, but the tiny round tables really don't work. Also, the bench seat along the wall is low and uncomfortable (I felt like I was sitting on a hump and worried that a spring might pop through), and I heard others complain about the cushioned chairs as well. Everything looks great -- but this is a case of form not following function. M&P needs to rethink this aspect of its design."}
{"text":"It had been awhile since my last visit to M&P, mostly because scoring a brunch reservation is about as easy as getting a hole-in-one.  But with a little planning we did it, and were really looking forward to the brunch.  I had the short rib hash, and my friends had the granola and berries and the huevos ranchero.  We had the sticky bun as an appetizer.  In order of greatness:  huevos ranchero was spicy and excellent.  The short rib hash and the granola were both good, but not great.  My hash was underwelming, the short rib meat was tender and delicious but there were only a few bites, mostly potatoes in my skillet.  The poached eggs  and horseradish sauce were the best part, and I just wanted more meat!  The presentation of the yogurt and granola was unique, and the combination of fresh berries and dried fruit made for a great texture/flavor combination, but atop two slices of raisin walnut bread it was just well...odd.  The bread was dense, so it wasn't soggy, but there was just something bland about it.  I would have loved more of the ricotta and the granola sans bread!  Last on our favorites list was the sticky bun, which was on the specials list.  First, know that the appetizer is a single sticky bun, do not be mislead by the plural form listed on the menu.  It was on the dry side, and we all just wanted to dunk it straight into our coffee. We all commented that a sticky bun is supposed to be sticky...this was more of a cinnamon roll...without icing.   Overall, it's still a great atmosphere, the DJ was a great bonus on Sunday morning before a Pirates game, cocktails looked spectacular as always.  Definitely get the heuvos ranchero, and from the looks of the table next to us...get the chicken and waffles...and share it...because it looked AMAZING!"}
{"text":"I will make this as helpful as possible for a review of a mostly boozed dinner.  I was in Pittsburgh for work and came here based on Yelp. I sat at the bar so I could work on my tablet like an antisocial monster. I had the Aged Manhattan which was AMAZING at $12. Then the Sgt Pepper's Old Fashion, $10. The bartender & bar back were so nice and attentive, also chatty and cute (not relevant, just saying). The decor, glassware and room vibe were all great. I needed food after those great whiskey options & was pretty upset there was only one steak entree option at a place called Meat and Potatoes... I ordered fried pickles which were delicious & complained to the staff. Apparently they almost always have a steak feature in addition to the one entree & the 45 oz ribeye for two, just not during my visit.  Go here, hopefully you can get tipsy & eat steak."}
{"text":"The decor here is fun, but the seating leaves a lot to be desired.  I don't know who came up with the idea to seat couples that don't know each other right next to each other, but that is the biggest draw back of this place for me.  I have been to a lot of the steak houses in the Burgh (Ruth Chris, Morton's, Capital Grille, Hyde Park) and Meat and Potatoes is my favorite.  I have never had a better aged rib eye, macaroni and cheese, and mashed potatoes."}
{"text":"It's been 3 years since my last review and after last nights experience, I had to update it.  I made reservations for 6p as soon as I could - January I believe - for 4/19 as I got my nephew the b-day gift of tickets to a show at 8p and he wanted to try bone marrow.  So what aunt doesn't try to fulfill that wish!?  (different nephew than previous review).    Traffic was horrendous yesterday evening and I even gave us 45 minutes to get to the reservations when it typically takes 15 minutes.  Knowing that i was going to be - at most 10 minutes late.  I gave Meat & Potatoes the courtesy of letting them know I was going to be a few minutes late.  Come to find out when I get to the restaurant at 6:03 (THREE MINUTES LATE) - they moved our reservation to 6:30.  First - who does that without telling you?!  I said i would be at most 10 minutes late - I said while on the phone I didn't expect more than 5 minutes.  I had made our reservations at 6p so that he could get and enjoy his food and we could get to the show with plenty of time- he's 13 from out of town - he wanted to experience something new!  Second - they tell me - we have you checked in and will seat you in the next 5 minutes.   We didn't get seated till 6:45 - 45 minutes after we arrived.  45 minutes after our reservations that I had confirmed via text message (their alert and Yelps alert!) that I had reservations at 6p.  I finally said something to the hostess at 6:45 as they had seated WALK INS before us.  That's when the steam started coming out of my ears.    While we were waiting - a group of 4 came in - and were seated within 10 minutes of arriving.  They had reservations for Thursday night - NOT tuesday - however the hostess was able to seat them.  Low and behold - when we finally got seated - they were seated beside us - at 2 - 2 tops put together.   I had a waitress that rolled her eyes at me when I told her we had a show to get to at 8p - and that it took forever to seat us.  My nephew didn't get the experience i had intended (as I had made reservations with 2 hours leeway!!!) I don't blame myself for that.  I blame meat and potatoes.  We didn't get our food till 7:25 - how are we supposed to enjoy anything?  We had to immediately ask for our check.  Oh - and we only ordered appetizers as there wasn't time for anything else - so you lost money as well.    Meat & Potatoes has likely lost my business by this.  The hostesses were rude and incompetent.  The waitress was rude.  I eat out often.  I am a \"foodie\" - I love trying the new places and eating at favorites.  But not at Meat & Potatoes.  The whole situation could have been avoided if I hadn't been a courteous customer and not called.  Lesson learned.  No reason to be a courteous patron to Meat and Potatoes folks!  Just show up as a walk in - you'll get seated faster than you would with a CONFIRMED reservation."}
{"text":"The food is excellent.  It is consistently well prepared amd the menu offers a wide variety.  The Bloody Mary bar is the best I have experienced in the area. It is filling - there are so many items to add to the bev.   However, I've had brunch twice here and both times I was sharply and frequently reminded that the kitchen was closing soon after our reservation time."}
{"text":"Excellent food and amazing staff. I really like the vibe here as well. The crowd varies from yuppie to urban. The drinks are incredibly elaborate and the food is extraordinary. I have never had a bad time at the joint. Although, it may be challenging to get seated or attention from the bartenders on a weekend night."}
{"text":"One of the best new restaurants in the Burgh! Went here for brunch and absolutely loved it.  The build your own Bloody Mary bar is incredible - the flavored vodka infusions, selection of \"fixings\" and most of all the price - only $5 each!!    Food was incredible too - had the brisket and eggs which was perfectly seasoned and delicious.  Sampled some of the chicken and waffles - the chicken was the best fried chicken I've ever had.   Can't wait for a repeat visit!"}
{"text":"What a bust. No notice they switched out their menu for a fried fish sandwich only lent menu.   Decided to go to Burgatory instead.  Meat and Potatos was slow. Burgatory was packed. Who made the better menu selection."}
{"text":"Everything here when I went for my anniversary was great. Drinks were very well made and the food was delicious. Only negatives were the closeness of the tables and the slightly condescending attitude of our waiter when we asked questions about the ingredients. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Love this place. Been several times. Great spirits selection. Awesome food. Chill atmosphere. Prompt and attentive service:)"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Meat & Potatoes for both Brunch & Dinner. The restaurant serves delicious meals, great drinks and a friendly wait staff.   The restaurant can get extremely busy, especially before a show in one of the nearby theaters. I would definitely recommend booking a reservation in advance, as you will not get seated without one during busy hours.   The restaurant has a dark atmosphere and a few of the tables are very close together, making it difficult to hold a conversation with all of the noise. I have found that it is better to eat at Meat & Potatoes will a group of friends or family, as you will get seated on the side of the restaurant that is less crowded.   Further, the restaurant has a private party room that can accommodate a large group of people for any event.   Overall, I would recommend Meat & Potatoes to anyone! It is a great place for a post-work drink, a pre-show dinner or a Sunday morning brunch."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food. Started with the short rib Mac and cheese for me and bone marrow for my husband. Both were fantastic but the bone marrow was the star. For entrees my husband had the lamb cassoulet and would not stop raving about it. I had the pappardelle and it was the best thing I've ever eaten, ever. I would have licked my plate clean if I could. We skipped dessert since nothing was standing out. Service was so/ so but the food made up for it"}
{"text":"Wow. The food here is some of the best we've had. Stared with the smoked wings which were fantastic, fried Brussels sprouts, and the house bread. All delicious. For main course we had the waygu steak and the double bones pork chop. The pork chop was huge!!! Once again delicious. Great service as well. Our waitress was new but full of great recommendations and super friendly!!"}
{"text":"Great GastroPub   Bone Marrow is off the charts good.   Dishes are creative and unique.   Duck with Grits was very good.  Only recommendation is that they need to improve the wines they offer - I had a taste of three different wines and they were just lower quality."}
{"text":"I recommend this place a lot. The atmosphere and decor is great from the moment you even walk into the lobby. The menu can suit anyone as they have burgers to bone marrow. The port de creme dessert is my weakness in life. Any flavor, I love them all. Oh and you can get one to go in a cute mason jar for an extra few bucks (danger).  They do \"night caps\" throughout the year on Mondays after 10pm that are super budget friendly and fun so follow them on Instagram to stay up on that. Or don't if you hate constant temptation."}
{"text":"Our favorite for brunch in Pittsburgh.  Great menu and even better Bloody Mary bar.  Never disappointed."}
{"text":"Best.Brunch.Ever!  We went this past Sunday.  We had a reservation, which turned out to be a very good idea, because they were packed and had a few walk in's waiting for their turn for a table.  We got Brent again for our server.  BJ got a Snapper Head Butternuts and I got an Aloe Vera Lemonade which I thought was a perfect drink.  We started with an order of grilled bread with goat butter and rhubarb jam which I thought was perfect!  BJ got the short rib hash with poached egg and  horseradish hollandaise.  He thought the flavor was excellent!!  I got one of the specials which was chorizo quesadilla served with potatoes au gratin and pickled veggies and avocado cream.  So, so yummy.  The portion sizes were adequate, leaving you satisfied but not over stuffed.  We also decided to have a red velvet cake and shared a Irish Breakfast coffee.  The coffee was served in a brandy glass with Jameson, bacon whipped cream and zest of orange.  Perfect ending to a fantastic brunch!"}
{"text":"I must admit that I went into this with 'pretentious bistroid' as my mindset, but going to the theater next door, thought I'd give it a try since it was closest.  Upon entering, the visual I took in was pretty much 'pretentious bistroid'.  Another Pittsburgh joint trying to be all NY or LA in a city that will never BE NY or LA.  I'd eaten there once before when it was Cafe Zao, and the atmosphere wasn't quite as pretentious, but the prices were truly outrageous, which was kind of what I was expecting this time around.  I went for brunch, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that not to be so.  I found a few things on the menu that looked intriguing for brunch, and the waiter, an older gentleman, was actually very kind and helpful, more so than the pretty little youth prancing around, noses in air, as if their mere presence was a gift to the diners.  I was flipping between three choices, and the waiter helped me decide on the Corned Beef Benedict.  We split an order of the pate, and each got coffee.    First came the water, in kitschy bottles, poured by the waiter and left on the table. It's kind of a lame attempt at 'theming' but theming only works if you go all the way with it.  But when in Pittsburgh is anything ever taken to the enth degree, when 'meh' is viewed as fabulosity?  Next arrived the pate in an adorable little mini-mason jar, complete with the dual snap lids. Again, really?  Cute, but highly unnecessary.  It was accompanied by two pieces of toast, cut in four, and the pate actually needed another slice of bread to match portioning.  However, the flavor and texture were very good.  A decent little appetizer.    The coffee test passed. I never soil coffee with cream and sugar, even if it's REALLY bad. My friend however will use cream and sugar if it is weak.  She didn't have to.  The coffee was decent for a cup of Pittsburgh American Joe.  Brunch arrived.  My friend had the short rib hash, and I had the Benedict.  The lunch dishes didn't match the attempted 'theming' (nor does the decor), and my friend (who is blind) took one bite from her little trendy dish and the food slipped over onto the table.  Again the waiter was extremely kind and helpful and brought her a real plate so she could eat without doing much damage.    The food...bottom line...was very good.  Flavorful, not toy food (but not quite a Pittsburgh shovel full), filling, and done well.    The server was not totally aloof (not chatty), but he was helpful and efficient without throwing an attitude.  My friend expressed an interest in dessert, and tried the chocolate mousse, which I did take a bite of, and it was really delicious.  The check came to around $48...not bad for an appetizer, two coffees, two entrees and a dessert in what is a somewhat 'upscale' type place.    I can't complain about the food or the price for lunch.  They surprised me very nicely.  My biggest complaint comes from the general atmosphere.  The seating is a long upholstered bench along the wall, with TINY marble tables, and an armless armchair on the outside of the table. Had the place been crowded we would have been sitting WITH the people at the next table.  Even with an empty table between us, we had to listen to the pretentious blurting of some food writer who was gushing all over the chef pretending that Pittsburgh was going to be the next gastronomical tourist destination...hate to break your heart sweetie, but Pittsburgh ain't going to be the next big tourist destination for ANYTHING until corruption money is funneled back into education, and yinzers stop partying like it's 1979.  I didn't quite know what to do with my feet as they either were resting on the cast iron legs of the tiny table, or had to be spread wide apart to hit the floor.  One, the tables are too small and round for two for brunch, with water, drinks, a water bottle, sugar, creamer, flatware, side dishes...oh wait...it's ok...I have a lap. Two, I can't imagine this being more comfortable or accommodating for a larger dinner setting.  The attempt at 'theming' either needs to be polished to completion, or abandoned, because what they do have just looks silly in a highly over-designed architectural space. You want to go 'speakeasy', then do some research and go all the way. Otherwise, skip the kitsch and focus on what you clearly are doing pretty well...make good food at a fairly reasonable price.  I can't say this would be a comfortable regular haunt, but I would go back for a somewhat special occasion.  Question is...do you want regulars, or special occasions in a VERY small market?"}
{"text":"I'm not really sure what all the hype is about here I went for brunch and got a bloody Mary for five dollars which is a great deal but I couldn't understand what any of the mixers were at the bar because none of them were labeled. I also had a grilled cheese sandwich with a tomato celery soup the cheese was really hard as if it had been sitting for a little while and the soup was very interesting my fault for not asking more detail about the soup. I just think that it shouldn't be hard to make a really good grilled cheese. I've heard good things about the bone marrow appetizer so I would definitely go back and give that a try."}
{"text":"love love loved this place! i'd heard about it before but never had the time to wait. yes, if your'e going on a whim be prepared to either scope out a seat at the bar or wait roughly 3 hours for a table. but it's worth it. my date and i stood at the bar and had drinks while we waited for a seat to open up. we didn't even quite finish our drinks before we were able to sit. and the bartender was super helpful with helping us scope out seats. both bartenders were very nice, personable, helpful, and friendly. i was pretty impressed. once we sat, we ordered food as well. i had the cheese board and split the pate with my date and he had the corndog. everything was super tasty and i'm eager to try more. i tried 2 different drinks. the first word (or last word? i don't remember, but it was a gin based drink) and the glenshaw sour. both were super tasty-- a twist on the gin and tonic and an old fashioned vodka sour. trust me, the drinks and food are both worth the wait if you have the time. and the prices really aren't too bad. sure, it's pricey, but i expected that. it's not overpriced, i wasn't upset about it, and everyone needs to check this place out."}
{"text":"Great service, pot roast was incredible,  pork belly tacos were great, and the appetizers were great (namely the fried pickles and Brussels sprouts). Wonderful! Will recommend to friends!"}
{"text":"Skip Mortons. Come here. It's seriously a wonderful dining experience. Spectacular food."}
{"text":"Went to a Steeler game over the weekend and was looking for a place to find the best sandwich in Pittsburgh PA! But oh my lord did I find the best sandwich I'll ever have in my life..The Three Little Pigs sandwich is the thickest, juiciest, and most tasty sandwich you'll ever take a bite out of. After devouring this beast, I was huffing and puffing all the way to a bed and went into the best food coma of my life. Service was tremendous and staff was very friendly. I might come back to Pittsburgh for this place and the sandwich, and maybe a steeler game :P TRY IT OUT"}
{"text":"I got the wagyu steak, and it was excellent! The penicillin cocktail was also very good, but light on the alcohol. Overall, I would recommend. The only downside in my opinion is that it is very pricey for the ambiance. It feels more like a speakeasy/bar than a fancy restaurant. Yet, we still spent about $130 for dinner and 2 drink/person for 2 people. At that price, I expect a fancier atmosphere."}
{"text":"Amazing gastropub in downtown Pittsburgh.  We've been here for after-dinner drinks and snacks, but most recently had the opportunity to check out their brunch, which they have on Saturdays and Sundays.  On a recent Sunday we tried to call ahead for reservations but were informed that they were completely booked.  However, we discovered that if you don't mind sitting at the bar, you can show up for brunch and walk right in.  We got there right at 10:30 and we had no problems.    Great atmosphere: exposed brick with a marble-top bar and old-school fixtures and weird antler-type chandeliers and things hanging on the walls, and a lot of mirrors and chalkboards where specials are written on the wall.   They had many brunch specials, but we went with the Irish Benedict and the Huevos Ranchero.  The Irish Benedict had an amazing hollandaise sauce over poached eggs, corned beef, cheese and some yummy thick toast.  The Huevos Ranchero were also amazing, with a delicious tomato-chili sauce, picked onions, and black beans.    Both meals were so large that we couldn't finish them.  I also ordered the potato gratin on the side, but it was sort of meh in comparison to everything else.    And the brunch cocktails were delicious: the papaya bellini was great, but the French 76 was amazing.   They have an extensive bloody mary bar which we didn't get, but it looked really fun, with all these self-serve fixins like tons of different types of olives, asparagus, artichoke, etc. etc.  Overall, great service, great atmosphere, fantastic food.  We'll be back for more Meat & Potatoes!"}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend here for his 30th birthday. Even though we've been to Meat & Potatoes before this was our favorite experience. Waitress was amazing, hanger steak was prepared perfectly, and they surprised us with complimentary champagne and desert for his birthday. All around a great place to celebrate a special occasion or brunch which we love!"}
{"text":"Great brunch! We heard a lot of great things about this place from locals, so we had to try when we got to town. Even at 1pm it was still packed, but we got a table quickly. The food was totally stellar and we got to take advantage of the bloody Mary bar. The atmosphere was cozy though small, but who cares what the place is like when you can get the best chicken and waffles in town?!"}
{"text":"Wonderful Dinner and Great Service!! Four of us arrived for our reservation and we were immediately seated. We did shared seven dishes and two desserts. Everything was great. Mussels and Frites, Pork Belly Tacos, were just two entrees we thoroughly enjoyed. Both Desserts, the Panna Cota and the Pot of Chocolate were excellent. They have a Great selection of Micro Brew's on Draft, as well as a nice list of Wines by the glass.  We really enjoyed the evening and highly recommend Meat and Potatoes to All. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite place to eat in Pittsburgh. I have gone more times than I can remember. Every single time I go, I try something different and I have never been disappointed. The brunch on Sunday with the Bloody Mary Bar is ridiculously fun, awesome and delicious. I had fried chicken with jalepeno waffles the last time I went and they were the best! Drinks are always different, interesting and amazing and I love the beer selection as well. They have wonderful specials on the menu board. The atmosphere is beautiful and relaxing. LOVE this place. Cannot speak highly enough about it."}
{"text":"Great experience the server was very helpful and knowledgeable about the menu and food options. There are so many good items to choose from that I found it hard to decide. In the end I picked the wagyu flat Iron steak. It didn't disappoint. It was very tender and savory, and the portion size was sufficient enough to please my appetite but still leave me room for dessert. My wife had the smores and I had the chocolate pot de creme. Both very tasty.  As for drinks, I wish I could recall the name of the cocktail I got. It was tequila based and I would definitely order it again(if I every remember the name). Lastly the only thing you have to okay with is how close your table is to your neighbor's. Very tight squeeze. But, that's really the only con to the place."}
{"text":"Wow!  This place was amazing!  Had the mussels of the day, 1 with curry the other with bacon and salmon roe.  If i wasnt with ppl from work i would have drank the broth.  Also had the chicken livers and fried pickles and both were very tasty.  My personal favorite was the roasted bone marrow.  It came with parsley garlic, sea salt, capers and pickled onions.  It was so F-ing good!!! For our main courses i had the pub which had pork belly a fried egg and havarti cheese.  It was messy but so good.  After all the apps i couldnt eat the whole thing and didnt touch the moutain of fries it came with.  Other entrees were the wagu flat iron with wasabi mash.  Def the 2nd best thing on the menu besides the marrow. The pork shank was as big as a football and had great flavors.  It literally melted in your mouth.  At a place called meat and potatoes we did have someone order pasta!!  What a sucker!  The papperdelle was very very good tho.  Our server did a great job and drinks were great too.  They dont have bottled beer which while that seemed wierd didnt take anything away from the great time we had.  Atmosphere was awesome and ambiance matched.  We finished with coffee and choc mousse.  Winning!!!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent.  Nice atmosphere, but can get loud.  Had a $200 dinner and was a bit irritated that when asked for another piece of bread for the stake tartar  (which only came with one slice) was charged more for the extra bread.   Seemed tacky to me!"}
{"text":"Go somewhere else for good service.  I went in on a Tuesday night, 3 bartenders on  service and 1 barback, 8 minutes until anyone acknowledged I was at the bar. Bar was not busy, empty seats, the female bartender walked past me 4 times didn't even say hi.   I was sitting in front of the cash register, the male bartender never looked up to even say hi.   I have lived in Las Vegas for the past 20 years this place is a poor copy of herbs and rye in Las Vegas.  I have no idea of how their food or drinks taste, if the service is this bad I wasn't interested in finding out.   Too many choices to waste time in a place that isn't interested in my business."}
{"text":"Lives up to its name. Had great service at the door and inside. Had the spring salad, which was light and refreshing before getting the pot roast and mashed potatoes, which were terrific and tasty; just enough to be filling but not stuffed. Ambience and location is also great. I would hesitate to return and try something else when I'm next in town."}
{"text":"After searching Yelp for a good brunch spot in the area, we walked over to Meat & Potatoes.  This place is definitely worth checking out if visiting Pittsburgh and want some delicious food.  Make reservations and you'll be glad you didn't have to wait in line.  The interior is pretty I like how there's a mirror along the walls so the people facing the wall are able to people watch behind them (I like the people watching.  Creepy, I know).  Fighting a hangover, I asked for a coffee and liked it.  We asked for suggestions from our server who was really great in explaining the menu favorites to us.  Even the server for the table next to us gave us her choices too.  Everyone there is very friendly.  My friend had the short rib hash which looked amazing. Okay, I can speak for it since I stole a bite from her place.  It was damn good.  I chose the French toast and boy was I glad I did.  It was probably the best French toast I had ever had.  Those bananas!  Like bananas foster and what's that sauce? I'm not good at reviewing food other than telling you it was mad delicious.    Wish we had another night in the city to check this place out for dinner.  Seems to be a popular place with the locals and with good reason  I would definitely go back here if ever in Pittsburgh again."}
{"text":"This review is severely overdue. We were in Pittsburgh for the first game of the Steelers season last September and I had reviewed Yelp for recommendations to eat. My husband is Paleo so places like Italian or Mexican are always out. The offerings here seemed to match with our interests. We had the Caesar salad with pig cracklins, the special of the day meatloaf and the lemon angel food cake. These were all perfectly fine items. I am here to sing the praises of the steak tartare on the starters menu. We live in the San Francisco Bay Area, so we have a ton of high end restaurants to pick from. The steak tartare at Meat & Potatoes is the BEST I have ever eaten, and my husband the Paleo eater agreed. It was simply spectacularly executed, beautifully plated and delicious. Next time we're in Pittsburgh we'll be sure to be back!!"}
{"text":"Me and the hubby went to a show at the Benedum.  We were intrigued and decided to get a brunch reservation.  Wow, so glad we did!  The banana and bacon sourdough french toast was devine!  It was more dessert than breakfast but oh so very worth it!  We got a side of their fried taters...some of the best fries we have ever had!  The hubby got one of their specials.  It was a crispy chicken bisquit.  It was good but not as good as the french toast!  They are on the list to try for dinner at some point!  We loved it and will definitly visit again!"}
{"text":"This place got five stars because it's by far my favorite restaurant downtown. My best friend took me out to dinner here not long ago and I was actually blown away  by how beautifully, succulently cooked the meats were.  I'm not a huge carnivore - I only like meat when it's brilliantly prepared, and this place does it.  The only other restaurant I know of in town that does equally wonderful preparations of meat is Union Pig & Chicken in East Liberty.   As for the atmosphere - it's fun, lively, youthful - and usually packed fully with theater go-ers, so I suppose that reservations are a great idea."}
{"text":"Loved it.  As a first timer to Pittsburgh this was  great. Portion sizes were great. Love the atmosphere.   Great beer selection."}
{"text":"Man was I glad I was able to score the one remaining seat at the bar for dinner. If you'll excuse the NY-centric description, M&P represents the middle ground between Brooklyn and Midtown. It's spacious and people stop there before the game, but it has chalk menus and interesting light fixtures and fresh craft cocktails. I can't recommend reservations enough, especially if there's anything going on across the river."}
{"text":"Fabulous food, great service. The staff was very considerate of the table's tree nut and egg allergy requirements."}
{"text":"We went with a big group of people, and were a little late in getting our reservations, so we had to eat at 9:30 at night.  They had us in a small room off the bar which was nice, so we could talk easily to each other.  The decor was pretty amazing, I really liked the ambiance they were setting up. While, I did not order cocktails, most people in our group did.  The first person to get his drink, had a decent sized glass, which led everyone else to feel okay that theirs would be a decent size as well.  Unfortunately, that was not the case, the cocktails came in 3 different sized glasses, none of which were large.  I believe that was where most of the disappointment lied with our group for the evening.  Don't get me wrong though, everyone enjoyed the flavor of their drinks immensely, but they were overpriced for how much you got.     Just to say we did, we got the bone marrow appetizer, and while only half our table tried it, those that did seemed to enjoy it - I know I did.  I also ordered the waldorf salad, which was amaaazing.   As far as the meals went, they were fairly reasonably priced, but the portion sizes were pretty scattered.  I ordered the 3 little pigs sandwich and got a fat-heads sized sandwich, and my boyfriend ordered the pork - which was also massive.  No complaints on our end on flavor or size.  Unfortunately our friend ordered the salmon, and was disappointed in the size of his meal, and ended up finishing his wife's french fries (which were some of the best I've had in the city).  Everyone else got what I would deem, an appropriate sized meal, with no left overs, but also no hunger pains at the end.  Overall, a good meal was had by all"}
{"text":"Found this place using Yelp for my birthday celebration, and I was so wow-ed!  Absolutely everything we ordered was delicious.    We started with the cheese plate, which was head and shoulders above every other cheese plate I've ever had.  It was full of new and interesting flavors, all of which paired perfectly.  Dinner was the duck - again, wonderful, complex flavors all of which played together in surprising and delightful ways.  Since the first two courses were so wonderful, dessert was a must - rich, decadent pot de creme.  Wow.  Since I'm expecting, I was sadly unable to sample the cocktail offerings, but there were a ton, and they all looked awesome.  The bar featured an absenthe fountain - seriously.  As other reviewers stated, seating is a little small and crowded.  This wasn't a problem for us, but we had no trouble chatting up our neighbor table in typical friendly Pittsburgh fashion.  If you're looking for a private and intimate setting, this is not it.  It is, however, fun and \"casual upscale.\"  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I so wanted to like this place because I heard so many positive things about it; however, it failed on so many levels.  We were seated like a bunch of anchovies in a can and every time a server walked past me my chair was bumped.  The choice of music was horrible ('60s /'70s depressing stuff) and it was blaring so I could not speak to my girlfriend without screaming.   We sat there for 15 minutes before our server came over to us and he said \"sorry but I just started here a month ago\".  C'mon! let's figure it out dude.  Our easy-peasy short two-item order was somehow lost between our table and the kitchen (distance of 30 feet, no joke) Really? REALLY??? I can hardly think of anything worse than completely omitting an entire table's orders. So there we sat,  45 minutes later still waiting for our plates, being bullied (by our own hunger, not by M&P staff) into ordering dish after unsatisfying overpriced dish of their so-called \"Meat & Potatoes\".  I finally asked our server how much longer our plates would be.  He comes back and tells me nonchalantly \"Your ticket was never put in, oops.\" No apology, not comps, nothing. WOW!  To boot, as we were paying our bill a huge centipede was crawling on the chair behind my girlfriend.  I killed it and told the server.  For some reason he giggled - I did not think it was funny.    Tell me, how can a restaurant overlook a ticket for a homonymous order? If that's not dropping the ball, I really don't know what is."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Seats weren't that hard to get if you come between 12:00-12:30pm. Any later then the place would get packed. Wish I came here for dinner so I can try their bone marrow. Let me skip to the chase and let you know what to order and what not to order.  - Roasted Brussels Sprouts: get it! Perfectly roasted, not bitter and covered with cheese - Fried Pickles: get this but keep in mind it's piping hot so don't burn your tongue like I did - Grilled Pork Chop: perfectly cooked- usually I'm skeptical of ordering pork chops because once you cook it too long, there's no saving it- you'll be stuck with dry tasteless pork...however! Meat & Potatoes does it just right. Paired with veggies and pork belly with a hint of Asian flavors, this is the dish to get  Definitely will be back when I'm around. I need to try their dinner menu!"}
{"text":"OMG!  The food was freakishly Awesome.  I was in the Pitt for a trade show and joined several colleagues for dinner here.  Didn't have reservations so we (3 of us) sat at the bar.  Took forever to even be acknowledged as humans. By the bar staff... Not a big bar but they still had 4 people behind the bar.  Rude ... Rude....Rude....Rude.... Employees. Food was awesome.  Will Never go back......."}
{"text":"Was visiting Pittsburgh from out of town and my friend took me here for brunch. The food was amazing! I got the chicken and waffles and it was delicious- but everyone's food looked great as well. Loved the bloody mary bar- definitely a must. Overall, I really enjoyed brunch here and would return if I lived in the city!"}
{"text":"\"Wow, he's a lot better looking than the last guy you brought in here.  What a joker!\"  Said the host to my husband.  Thanks, Charlie.  Thanks a lot.  However, since I haven't actually been to Pittsburgh for about 7 years, the innocent act worked this time and the night was saved.  Our waitress was very good, and helpful!!  We made our way through the non-mammalian portion of the menu in that really beautiful, but laid back space.  The duck liver pate was oralgasmic.  The lemongrass moules- frites were delightful.  I had to restrain myself from picking up the bowl and slurping the broth!!    The soft-shell crab tacos were perfect.  Eating\"soft\" shell crabs that have been allowed to live too long is like getting a mouth full of fingernails.  These, however, were light, crispy and delicious.  I feel sort of bad eating them at their most sensitive point, though.  there they are, little crabs who are all vulnerable, maybe thinking of writing poetry again and BAM, someone throws them in the deep fryer.  Better luck next life, little crabs.  You were delicious.   The only disappointment of the night were the fancy cocktails.  They were OK.  The Aviation was too gingery and the hot date was weak tasting.  So stick to beer and wine and your will have an utterly fantastic dinner."}
{"text":"Meat & Potatoes was a blast. Arrived w/o a reservation on a Saturday night and even though we were told we would not get a table for another 1.5-2 hours we could find seats at the bar. We found one for the two of us (of course) but decided to stake our territory anyway with the one chair and to grab another when one freed up, which took some waiting and work including dealing with a rude old man...  Aside from that I love the dark interior of M & P with the mirrors and gold trim surrounding the room. It adds a nice element of elegant coziness.   The bartenders greeted us and were kind enough to give us a sample of the beers we were interested in trying. Ordered the Oscar and my bf ordered the Kobe Flat Iron. Oscar had a cut of veal, a fried soft shell crab on top and a side of risotto. Delicious - kind of on the salty side but I like it that way. I ate every bite but I had a hard time cutting with the knives they gave me (first butter knife then was given a steak knife when realized I was cutting with a butter knife). And the service continued to be great - the bartenders checked in periodically, were friendly and didn't push you out of  M & P. They let you soak in the experience and we did."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have come to the conclusion that this is by far our favorite restaurant.   We made out reservation about a month in advance.  That was the only way we would ever get a 7 pm table for 2 on a Saturday night.  We got there a little bit early, so we had a drink at the bar.  The cocktail menu is adventurous and yummy.  You can always ask a bartender to surprise you, just give them some favorites of yours.    Once we sat down, we were presented with the menu and an explanation.  We settled on the pulled pork mac and cheese and the mussels.  The mac and cheese was to die for.  The mussels were also great; we chose a tomato based sauce, not our normal white wine sauce.  We decided to switch from cocktails to wine for the main course. The wine selection was expansive and the waiter was very knowledgeable.  I had the salmon, which was cooked just to my specifications.  I like my fish undercooked, which some restaurants don't seem to like.  He had the hanger steak which was also cooked to perfection.  The sides to both of our entrees were exciting, rare and complemented the meals well.    I forget what we had exactly for dessert, but I think it was some cookie dough type pudding.  We shared this as we were incredibly full, and it was scrumptious.   The only complaint I have is the the 2 person tables are a bit close together.  The couch that wraps around the wall (one of the seating for each 2 top), seems as if the springs have gone.  You sit down and sort of sink another 4 inches.    Overall, we are looking forward to our next visit, as this restaurant is amazing!"}
{"text":"Not sure we could have had a better dining experience anywhere. We were seated promptly at the time of our reservation and found the decor to be very welcoming and the chairs very comfortable. We started with a drink and ordered some wine, then ordered a couple of appetizers. My wife's \"Kobe corn dog\" made her day and the curry mussels were the best thing I have eaten in a long time. The portion was huge and I would have gladly eaten the curry broth as a soup!  We got the meat and potatoes for two, which was cooked absolutely perfectly and we ate almost all of the gigantic portion. Although slightly under salted, it was a great presentation and a very nice cut of ribeye. Our dessert, some type of chocolate pot de creme, was delicious as well. The service was fantastic and I felt that, although expensive, the meal was a good value. Can't wait for our next trip!"}
{"text":"I was visiting Pittsburgh for the first time and wasn't quite too sure how the food scene was like.  I'm so glad we found, Meat & Potatoes.  Atmosphere dimly lit  * casually refined  * Gastropub *  trendy   Apps $7--Chicken Livers- I'm not a big fan of liver but my table enjoyed it. The waiter was kind enough to bring us the truffle mayo (that came with fries) upon request. $16-- Mussel - I love mussels but never had I had mussels with salmon roe, bacon, balsamic vinegar pearls & dill in a tomato sauce. As odd as this all sounds, it was fantastic.    Entrees (we all kind of shared) $19 -- Hudson Valley Duck Breast /pastrami crusted duck / sauerkraut pierogies /  scallion butter / dandelion greens / chimichurri ***This was my entree.  The CRUST on this duck is ridiculously DELICIOUS. The duck was perfectly cooked- tender, juicy...and so... mmm.  The pickled onions, dandelion greens & chimichurri complimented the richness of the duck well. I wasn't a big fan of the perogies (dumplings filled with potatoes & sauerkraut).  I took a few bites but it's just not my thing. Overall, good portion size and value.  Definitely would order this dish again.   $20-- Pork/smoked chop / pastrami / baked beans / spicy collard greens  ***My friend got this and it was HUGE! It must of been a double/triple cut pork chop.  Even had some folks from surrounding tables starring out of curiosity.  Usually when I think of pork chops, I think about dry and chewy. Not so the case here.  It  was moist and the sauce was really flavorful.  Spicy collard greens were good. ORDER THIS!  $29-- Wagyu Flat Iron / charred carrots / queso fresco / cilantro / pepita / radish / chili sherry vinaigrette  ***  My BF ordered this and it was probably my least favorite of the three entrees-- not to say it was bad.  The meat was cooked well, but it was a little on the plain side for me and it was the most expensive out of the three. I wouldn't order this.    Food is excellent, and the service was great. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Cool hip ambiance comfortable seating  nice lighting  and great cocktails especially the old time refresher.  Started with the devils on horseback which were delicious.  Then continued with the flat iron steak and braised Brussels which were both ridiculously great! Highly recommend. Mike the bartender was very accomadating!"}
{"text":"Had brunch twice. Great experience both times. Very talented staff. I ordered the chicken and waffles both times and it was delicious. The Bloody Mary bar is also fun and impressive. The ambience is also very inviting and relaxing."}
{"text":"This is by far some of the best food I have ever eaten!  It took us a very long time to get a reservation trying multiple times we were in the city and for my honeymoon weekend and my birthday.  But, my husband and mother decided to just make a reservation and go there for no occasion.     I was slightly worried it was going to be pertinacious, but I was wrong.   The food is fantastic for a foodie and familiar enough for someone who is not. We got the mac and cheese and grilled bread to start.  The goat butter was so good I wanted to ask if I could take what was left home.   For the entrees I got hanger steak, my mother got fish and chips, and my husband got the duck.  Everyone was satisfied and full.  We didn't get any alcoholic drinks, but the soda came in some very neat glasses.    We got a reservation for my next birthday :-)... Would definitely recommend, but there isn't much seating so a reservation a couple weeks ahead is necessary."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my dinner here. We made reservations and we were seated very quickly as soon as we came.   The food was great, interesting but not too out there. The cocktails were quite tasty and visually appealing.   Ambience was extremely hipster but that's pretty common nowadays, was nice. Seats were comfortable.   My only thing is waitress sometimes took too long to come back to the table. There is a balance between hovering too much and not being able to be found."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is so cool!  The drinks are excellent and the food is even better. I've ordered the black bass on one occasion and the agnolotti on another.  Both dishes were the perfect size and were loaded with flavor! My favorite appetizer is the bone marrow.  Before visiting meat & potatoes I had never tried bone marrow before, but since then I've tried it at several other restaurants around the country and none have measured up to meat & potatoes.  My only complaint is that the tables are very close together, so I felt like the neighboring tables were listening to my conversations and I felt like I was eavesdropping on theirs.  An excellent pre-show dinner option for sure!"}
{"text":"UPDATED REVIEW: I have to start by saying that my girlfriend and I have eaten here at least twice a month since we moved to the area 5 months ago. And it's usually pretty stellar. Tonight was a major exception.  This was our go-to place to bring friends and family when they visit, but we have changed our minds for this Friday, when our family is coming to town.  We ordered the new ginger cocktail, which we have had a few times since our favorite Bramble has left the menu. This time, the drink left my mouth burning with straight fresh ginger. After getting an eye roll and a sigh from our server, we were able to exchange them for the Clover Club drink. We then ordered the Kobe Corndog, which is usually a great appetizer. This time, it was cold. Sigh. But the kitchen mistakes don't stop there. I ordered the bone marrow, which arrived RAW. I was then challenged to an argument by a server (Shane?) who told me that 'technically it is cooked through'. The nerve to tell me that my bleeding bone marrow is 'technically cooked'. He was then gracious enough to 'have the chef take a look at it for me' ?!? Are you kidding? I didn't come out to eat to have to argue over my date's shoulder and the loud music over something as simple as putting a bone back in the salamander. My girlfriend and I both work in jobs where customer service is a top priority, and it would be nice to think that we could expect the same when we come out to eat.   To top it all off, our server never once checked in on us, and was so timid she didn't even ask if we needed a dessert menu.  We are really dissapointed in our experience this evening, we will not be returning to this place for a while."}
{"text":"The food was probably worth at least 4 stars, but other aspects of our dining experience resulted in an overall lower rating. I second what others have said about the hostesses. I've tried to get a reservation in the past and received similar responses to other reviewers. This time we made the reservation 2-3 months in advance so there was no problem. We had to make a 7:30 show and requested a 5:30 reservation so that our meal would not be rushed. We were told that a 6:00 would be plenty.   Yes, they got us out of there in time to put leftovers in the car and still get to the theater, but........Our meal didn't hit the table until 6:55. The steak and frites were great, but I didn't eat a lot of it b/c I didn't want all of the heavy food sitting in my stomach throughout the show. Given how late the food came out of the kitchen I also didn't want to inhale my meal and be even more uncomfortable. They probably would have made more money on us if we got the earlier reservation too. I definitely would have ordered more wine, some before dinner and some during. Dessert was not even an option.  The steak was really thick and delicious. However, there were so many flavors on the plate that it was a bit over the top. Either one of the sauces or the frites were extremely salty, which then just took over the flavor. My husband had the flat iron steak and loved it. The mushrooms and sauce were divine.   All of this being said, I would definitely go back but not on a night when I had to be somewhere else at a certain time."}
{"text":"I've been to brunch here twice and I can't wait to go back. The Bloody Mary bar is a meal within itself, with a diverse selection of garnish. The infused vodkas are also a treat, but regular vodka bloodies were just as enjoyable. Everyone at our table, in both instances, loved their food. I've had the Eggs in Purgatory and the Short Rib Hash and would highly recommend for a hearty breakfast. I can't wait to see how this menu will change come spring/summer.  And I'm dying to try one of their Eggs Benedict specials.  Also, for making two trips to the Bloody Mary bar, each and ordering brunch entrees, my husband and I were surprised of how little our bill was compared to some other higher end brunch places we've been ot."}
{"text":"walk-in on Saturday, July 5. the hostess said it would be 30 min for an outside table, no biggie. we went to the bar and sat down, bartender walked us through the menu and bloody mary bar, only to tell us that bar seating is for breakfast only and that the hostess would need to seat us here also. seems like a detail you should mention from the beginning.   would not recommend this place, hostesses were cold and not helpful."}
{"text":"We had reservations after a hockey game. Having had a huge brunch we still weren't super hungry, but we wanted to give this place a try. We had the honey-glazed fried pork ears as an appetizer (GREAT!) a flatbread pizza, and the short rib bolognese pasta. Delicious meal!"}
{"text":"We arrived 20 minutes earlier than our reservation, so we decided to indulge in a dirty martini before dinner. For $21 we got two less than 6 ounce martinis, excluding the tip. As a Miami Beach local, I am used to overpriced cocktails but was surprised by this in Pittsburgh.  Afterwards, we were seated at a very comfortable table for two closely nestled between two other tables. I tend to avoid seating situations like this, but it wasn't overwhelming. In fact, it gave us an opportunity to see what other diners were enjoying. To my surprise their signature appetizer is bone marrow, which is literally served in the cow bone, which is then spread across bread.   We weren't feeling adventurous enough for that and decided to try the fried pickles, risotto, and Mac n Cheese instead. We split our entree - a flat iron flap steak, which was perfectly cooked and jam packed with flavor.   The wine list was simple and in comparison to the cocktails, very affordable, I had a bottle of Malbec while my boyfriend went with a bottle of Pinot Grigio - both under $34.   Overall the staff was pretty attentive but we still had to hunt down our waitress every so often. I absolutely hated their choice of glassware. Wine served in tumbler glasses and martinis served in a weird sort of snifter. I'll pass on that.   I would recommend this place to friends."}
{"text":"Visiting from Orlando, FL. This place was recommended and through all of the hype, it wasn't as impressive as it was made out to be.  Appetizers-  Fried chicken livers (heavy batter and slightly salty) it came with a sauce on the side but I felt that the sauce was too overwhelming and tangy.  Poutin- French fries, it was cheesy and drenched in gravy, (just ok)  Bone Marrow- it came out with 3 large bones to scrape and eat with crispy bread. There wasn't much flavor to it as anticipated. It could've used some seasoning or even a dash of salt.   For the main dish we ordered the Ribeye for 2 (medium rare), with the sides of au gratin cheesy potatoes and cauliflower mixed with capers.  Overall it was just OK. Pricey place and it was good but not amazing like everyone made it out to be.  Also ordered 3 glasses of scotch and our total came out to be $250 before tip."}
{"text":"Did not disappoint! The mussels were amazing and watching people attempt to woof down the giant steak was worth the trip."}
{"text":"Thank god for these guys a bit of new York in the burgh  keep it up."}
{"text":"Got recommendation from local folks for this restaurant  and OMG! Everything is so delicious and fresh.  Each dish is perfect. Really recommend it if you are in Pittsburgh and have only one mean. I will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"We usually dine at Meat and Potatoes a few times a year.  Mostly so my wife can satisfy her duck cravings.  I have to admit after reading some recent reviews about M&P I was a little nervous.  We have always had a good experience here and I didn't want that to end.  Well the jury is out and M&P is still one of our favorite restaurants.   I made reservations awhile ago for 515pm.  I could have made them for later in the night but I thought we were going to go to the baseball game right after so I made it this early.   We ended up not going to the baseball game this night and we were feeling rushed to get there by 515.  So my wife called to see if they were able to bump our reservation to a little later time.  She talked to a hostess and they were polite and changed our reservation until 645pm.  That was great and it worked out so perfect for us too.       When I made the reservation I requested that we could sit outside.  The girl on the phone said they couldn't guarantee it but she would put a note that we would like to sit outside.  We love M&P but sitting indoors can get squished.  That is probably the only thing that we don't like about M&P.  You sit so close to other tables that you can hear their conversation and they can hear yours just as easily.  So that's why we requested to go outside.   I dropped off my wife in the front and then I parked.  She asked them too sit outside and we got to!  If it's a nice day sit outside at M&P!  You have a lot more room and you can't hear your neighbors conversation.       So far so good!  I ordered a water and wifey got a Black Manhattan.   She ordered her Duck and I ordered the Pork.  The food came out at a good time and it looked great.  She liked her duck although she said it was better in prior times but she still liked it a lot.  I really liked my smoked pork shop.  It was huge and it came with pastrami pork belly, baked beans, and spicy collard greens.  The temperature on the pork was perfect.  Even my wife tried it and loved it she said.        Did we luck out?  Has the service and food gone down this past year? I don't know.   Maybe it has but for my personal experience it hasn't.  We will be back like usual in 6 months so she can her duck and I will try something new."}
{"text":"My friends and I made a reservation for Saturday night, the earliest they could take us was 10 so we had drinks downtown before dinner. When we arrived they sat us right away, luckily, because the bar there was completely packed.  So the lighting is very dim with dark walls and floor to ceiling windows. Wonderful for a 10 o'clock dinner. We started with cocktails. The Boyd & Blair sours cocktail was frothy and smooth and it tasted like fall. My friend had the Slow Gin Fizz which was also delightful.  We ordered the mussels in a lemongrass sauce that was reminiscent of a thai curry and they were spicy but not too hot. Definitely try this out!  For entrees we ordered the Salmon, the Pot Roast, Fried Pickles and Waldorf Salad. I loved the salmon, but after trying the pot roast I will order it next time. My friend said \"this is the best pot roast I ever had... sorry mom...\" The fried pickles were crispy and seasoned well.  For dessert we had the buttermilk panna cotta and the vanilla bean pot de creme. They were both amazing but I would definitely recommend the panna cotta if you must choose.   Service was prompt, we were never waiting long for anything, not even our waiter. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Maybe we should have ordered the steak.  Had salmon. Lucky my husband likes siracha because it was covered in that sauce.  Also had the duck. Good but I've had better.  The bartender was entertaining but a bit arrogant.  Overall would not go back."}
{"text":"Excellent food, exceptional service we shared  the giant ribeye between 4 people and no one left hungry, the experience of having a full steer rib bone set upon your table is unique to say the least. This should be a must for any visit to pittsburg."}
{"text":"After hearing rave reviews and watching the Food Network special on this restaurant, my parents and I were looking forward to dining here.  The first time we stopped by, we learned that it is so busy most days that you need a reservation.  We promptly booked a reservation for the following week.  The first sign that the service is less than adequate was that I received a text message reminder that my reservation was for 15 minutes later than what I booked and it included an extra person.  I called, and although the hostess was apologetic, they were unable to change the time to what I originally booked.    I am gluten-intolerant.  Dining out at any restaurant is a risk that I assume, but I do expect a high quality restaurant to try to get it right.  After informing the waitress of my food sensitivities, I ordered the tartare.  It arrived on top of a piece of bread.  The waitress was apologetic, but I didn't have much confidence in the food service after that.  Also, what kind of a restaurant serves tartare on top of bread???  That's a great way to ruin a beautiful delicacy, ability to eat bread aside.    For the main meal, my mother and I ordered the meat and potatoes for two.  It was a novelty and we were both pleased with the presentation and the taste of the meal.  We had a lot of leftovers, and that brings me to another very disappointing experience.  We scraped all of the meat off the bone prior to having the waitress take it back to box it up.  When we opened the box the next day, we discovered that they only gave us half of the meat.  This is unacceptable for what we paid for the meal and the amount of meat that was leftover.  We were not otherwise impressed with the service, as it was difficult to get the attention of the waitress throughout the meal.         The atmosphere was not quite what we were expecting.  We were expecting more of a higher quality, upscale dining experience, but the music was too loud for conversation.  The decor was unique, although the chairs in the waiting area desperately need to be restored.    Overall, I don't feel that the meal was worth the money that we spent.  If you have food sensitivities, beware!"}
{"text":"Well, this place was on the travel channel today and I decided we should head there for dinner.  Wow, the food was incredible. Very warm and cozy place that you will enjoy!!  The mussels app was incredible. We had three choices of broth to have our mussels in.  It was incredible. A huge bowl was served and I think I was pretty full after that app.    The main course was scrumdidilyumtious. Sorry, it was a word from willy wonka but I had a quagmire moment as well in my own head.    I ordered the pot roast which was server in a Le Creuset mini kettle with lid.  This was served with delicious veggies and mashed potatoes. The gravy was phenomenal.  This was a serious dish and I complemented it with a Sgt Peppers Old Fashioned. The drink was excellent. The service was fantastic. Everyone was very attentive to us and kept our table neat and tidy.  Fantastic teamwork and an amazing experience.  Nice job!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, great service and some good wine and drinks on offer.   The only snag is that it's too popular, so you need to me a reservation."}
{"text":"Nice Gastro-pub in the Cultural District of Pittsburgh: good decor, good selection of wines and beers, interesting menu resulting in tasty and well presented food, friendly service.  So the only thing that causes a miss of full marks is that music levels are OK for its -pub persona, but too loud for the Gastro- part ..."}
{"text":"Had dinner here by myself while visiting Pittsburgh. Had the bone marrow and pot roast.  The marrow was heaven! It was well roasted, melted in your mouth. I don't think I've had better elsewhere.  I could have ended there but went on to ruin my night with the pot roast. It was bland and jello like in some bites.  The service was great and ambiance was dark."}
{"text":"I really love the food here. I've been here a couple of times. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. They have the best fried pickles I've ever had and I used to live in the south.  I give it 4 stars because whoever is running the front desk/telephones is pretty rude. We made a reservation and they told my husband we could have it but we had to be out by 7:15. Okay...great. Then they called to confirm our reservation and told us the same thing. I think that's pretty rude and strange to say to a paying costumer."}
{"text":"I don't usually like fancy, hyped up brunch spots but Meat & Potatoes was actually very good. My girlfriend and I shared an assortment of dishes: short rib hash, Irish benedict, carbonara, and fried taters. Everything was delicious but my absolute favorite was the carbonara. You can't go wrong when you combine creamy pasta with eggs. Yum! We also shared dessert..a white chocolate pretzel cheesecake (?) which was really good as well. Total cost for all that food was about $50. Not bad considering how popular the restaurant is and the quality of the food."}
{"text":"This place is great! The risotto is very good ! It's a bit strong on the black pepper ! But i liked it very much!  Great atmosphere"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in town.   The steak for two is one of those simple meals made elegant and perfect thronging preparation and top notch ingredients.   Excellent bar menu with expertly crafted cocktails. Prices are on the higher side for Pittsburgh but worth every penny.   And don't forget to stop in for Brunch some time, as good as dinner!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Terrific food, great drink selection, great atmosphere, great service, my friends and I had a blast! This place is top flight and don't miss a chance to check it out."}
{"text":"Had Sunday brunch here and everything we had was delicious. Short rib hash, French toast, and the chicken and waffles. I enjoied the music , the only probelm we had was the the table was super small. It seemed cramped when eating."}
{"text":"I've heard many people rave about this place, but I will not be one of them.  Having LOVED the restaurant formerly in that space (Café Zao), this is quite a departure.  We ate there one Light-Up Night in Pittsburgh with reservations being made more than a month in advance.  For 4 people, they pulled together two very small round tables right near the bar.  It was obnoxious and so loud that we could not have a conversation.  The food was ok, nothing special."}
{"text":"I had always heard such great things about Meat and Potatoes, so I had very high expectations. However, I have tried it three times, and I definitely didn't love everything. The first time I tried the duck salad, which wasn't the best, but we started with the Devils on horseback, which I would highly recommend.   The second time was a hit. We ordered the fried pickles, and I ordered the pot roast, which were both great. However this past time, the service of wasn't great, and I wasn't super impressed by the duck entree. This restaurant is definitely hit or miss for me. I would like to be back to try the brunch, but I'm not so sure that I will return for dinner."}
{"text":"Being an IUP Alum from Philly; I have made MANY wknd trips to Pgh over the past 10 years to visit my college friends.  We usually frequent South Side for our dining pleasures but my friend took us to Meat & Potatoes for brunch after our marathon style Saint Patrick's Day rage-fest last year.  Not being a huge breakfast food person but still looking for something to \"soak up the booze\"; I opted for the five-cheese grilled cheese and tomato soup! It was HUGE and DELICIOUS! I'm pretty sure someone at the table had Chicken & Waffles and another had Huevos Rancheros which were also amazing!  I also remember diving into someone else's left over fried taters. Yum!  I needed a nap after this one.  It has been a while since I was at Meat & Potatoes but I remember a large make-your-own Bloody Mary bar.  Great for the Sunday Funday hangy cure.  Next time I am in Pgh, I may request a return visit to Meat & Potatoes!"}
{"text":"I had my first Meat and Potatoes experience a few weeks ago as part of Pittsburgh Restaurant Week. My friend and I made reservations for a weekday and I basically spent that entire workday looking at the menu and salivating.  We decided to go with the prix fixe restaurant week menu, which had a fitting \"meat and potatoes\" theme for each course.  The first course was beef carpaccio with cute little crispy potato chips, arugula, quail yolk, and a taleggio foam. The carpaccio was melt-in-your-mouth delicious. The portion was very generous, especially for an appetizer course. I would go back just to have this again.  Second course was grilled flank steak, potato gnocchi, and basil salsa verde. The meat was perfectly cooked--extremely tender and full of flavor. We loved the pillowy gnocchi, which were a delicious companion to the steak and the salsa verde. My friend and I both later agreed that this was our favorite course. The menu referred to this as a \"stew\" but I'm not sure I would use that word as I was picturing a hearty soup of some sort. Regardless, this dish was perfect and we loved it.  The third and final course consisted of crispy short ribs, pickled Swiss chard, baby carrots, and potato croquettes. Again, the meat was tender and packed with flavor. The crispiness of the fried croquettes added great texture, and it was nice to have the carrots and chard to add in some other flavors. This was served with a very rich gravy and overall had the feel of comfort food, elevated.   For an additional $20 or so, M&P offered a paired cocktail for each course. My friend and I had gone to happy hour prior to dinner so we decided against the three drinks (I wanted to actually remember the meal...) but we did each order a cocktail off the regular menu. We had a Clover Club and the Seven Year Itch, both of which were great. They had a nice selection of both classic and new craft drinks.  The restaurant itself has a nice, trendy vibe but doesn't go overboard. The staff was friendly and we didn't run into any service issues.  Overall this was a positive experience and I'm excited to go back. Based on other reviews, I think my next trip here will be for brunch. The words \"Bloody Mary bar\" are enough to draw me in!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times. It was one of the first places I went to since moving home from NYC. You will find creative and edgy cocktails and dishes here that made me feel like I was trying a new spot off the L train in Brooklyn. Sometimes the staff even has ironic bow ties and facial hair. Its great and I have not been disappointed by anything here."}
{"text":"Party of four, started with the Bone Marrow, Mushroom Risotto, Devils on Horseback, and Duck Confit Flatbread.  All were delicious, but the Marrow was a standout.  For entrees, two of us had the Hudson Valley Duck, one had the Wagyu Beef, and one had the Meatloaf Special.  Everything was fantastic.  Service was great, would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Meat and potatoes is always amazing. The appetizers are delicious, the food is on point, and the drinks are mouth watering. It's a must go."}
{"text":"I almost can't articulate how wonderful my brunch was at Meat and Potatoes this past weekend, but I will try.  I went with a friend who I was visiting in Pittsburgh and we both got the Irish Breakfast Coffee, which was Jameson, Maple Whipped Cream, and Orange Peel. It was really delicious, not too boozy, just enough to tingle a little bit with the citrus when you took a sip.  We also shared the grilled bread with goat butter and rhubarb, and honestly I would have been sold at just bringing me the jar of rhubarb. It was so, so so good. And the perfect portion to not fill you up before your main dish.  For my main, I had the PBLT. I love BLT's as they are, and I've had other iterations of them with avocado and what not, but I don't think I was prepared for this. Pork belly, bacon, arugula, tomato and truffled mayo... AND it came with delicious fries?  Everything was fantastic all around, if you don't give this place a shot you're doing yourself a disservice."}
{"text":"Skee-Lo was wrong.  I'll say it right now.  He said,   I wish I was little bit taller, I wish I was a baller I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat and a '64 Impala*  You know who would NOT say that?  The short ribs flat bread at Meat & Potatoes. They embrace their shortness.  The Short Ribs Flat Bread has blue cheese / cheddar / arugula / horseradish.  That's all you need to know to understand this is delicious and those ribs don't need to be any taller!  Very cool decor, interesting menu, pretty good beer selection (I had an IPA from 21st Amendment brewery) but the reason this is five stars is the service. I sat at the bar and the three guys behind there were awesome.  Made great recommendations, made sure I had everything I needed and provided by far the best service I've ever had in Pittsburgh.  They get bonus points because one guy noticed I was wearing an Archer t-shirt and asked if I knew the Bloody Mary prayer**, which of course I did.  He said a lot of the bartenders have been reciting that.  Nice.  I don't know how I got Skee-Lo and Archer references in the same review, but hey, it's Pittsburgh.  Anything can happen!  Do me a personal favor and give this place a try.  _____________________________________________  * here's the audio track for Skee-Lo's biggest hit http://youtu.be/2s7MmcDjwek **Bloody Mary prayer- http://youtu.be/szwbdSK12hw"}
{"text":"Fantastic vibe, great drinks, good food.  Mussels were my favorite, tried the beer mussels and they were fresh, perfectly seasoned, and made me want to scoop up and drink all the broth.  Bone marrow was okay, and salad was okay.  I think that about sums it up - the space is very hip and cool, the drinks are amazing (especially for someone who normally doesn't drink), the food is pretty good - definitely 4 stars good, great portions as well.  Just expect to hover over the bar if you didn't make reservations - but definitely worth a shot."}
{"text":"Tartare, sardines, gnocchi and pork chop along with craft cocktails and great service from KC... This place is great!  I will return and bring friends and family."}
{"text":"My all-time favorite restaurant!! Making a reservation is a must because there's no a ton of seating. Great for date night and special occasions!"}
{"text":"While out in PIT, I checked out this Gastro pub. I have food restrictions and the staff worked with me around my dietary needs. I had the ahi tuna taquitos, salmon, and for dessert.....the Oreo mud pie. The flavors and ingredient combinations were great!  The meal at Meat & Potatoes one of the best that I had in PIT.     The gastro pub itself was tastefully decorated with modern decor and upbeat vibe.   I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant/bar combination in Pittsburgh. I still remember the opening of this restaurant as almost a beginning of the Pittsburgh foodie scene.  My recommendation here is sitting at their amazing bar with a friend, getting their Steak for Two (a huge 45 oz bone-in tomahawk)  and their Barrel Aged Manhattan (with a couple extra amarena cherries).  The food menu is always rotating with some interesting specials, but their mainstays (mac & cheeses, pasta, bone marrow, risotto, etc.) are phenomenal and I feel like I've tried almost all of them at this point.   This is the type of place where you come to the bar for just a drink and end up ordering all kinds of food because of how good it is."}
{"text":"I love this place for food and service!  Always a great experience and the food is flavorful!  If you don't have a reservation, the wait can be ridiculous, but it is worth it.  you can also walk up to the bar and they serve the full menu there.  I like their decor and location.  They also have outside seating.  I feel like it's a speakeasy type place because they serve the types of drinks served at speakesies.  My husband, who is a whiskey drinker, likes their manhattan drink  He says they make it differently here.  I'm not a whiskey person, so I won't be the best judge in that matter.  Like in everyone's reviews, the bone marrow appetizer is a must.  It may sound steep to pay $18 for it, but they actually give you a lot of bone marrow.  I've been to places where they serve one bone marrow, but this appetizer can be shared with 4 adults.  I say adults bc we have big appetites. LOL.  You can eat it as an entree bc it is filling, but probably won't be good for you healthwise.  The flavor is amazing with the toast and condiments that come with it, and you can ask for more toast if you want.    Tonight, my husband and I had dinner here before a show at heinz hall.  My husband had the duck dish and I had the pork belly tacos.  The portion here is huge, so I really feel like the price is on point.  My husband really wanted a peanut butter oreo dirt dessert, but I had to be a downer bc I wanted to go to another bar for martinis.  they have yummy desserts here.  I think they rotate but I remember the cheesecake in a jar being delicious.  The brunch is also good.  I like the short rib hash and huevos rancheros.  I've had better chicken and waffles in other cities, but this is the only place I know so far in pittsburgh that has chicken and waffles.  What I didn't like was the waffles were tough like it was dry and needed more syrup than what was given.  We had our engagement brunch here a year or so ago.  We were a group of 14, and when I originally made the reservation, they could only give us 2 separate tables.  I ended up saying yes to it bc I really wanted my out of town fam and friends to try this place.  They were so accommodating and ended up giving us the private room in the back.  eventhough it was hidden past the kitchen, that did not bother us at all.  I like how they arranged the tables into a big square, so it was easy to talk to everyone.  At that time, I forgot what everyone got, but everyone was impressed with the quality of food and the decor.  I feel like that says a lot bc our fam and friends came from foodie cities like chicago, nyc, seattle, cali.  In general, I highly recommend this place.  Good place to take an out of towner."}
{"text":"Brunch here is awesome, and one of the best deals in the city. M&P is one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh.  1.) $5 bloody mary bar with infused spirits (jerk, bacon, & jalapeno tequila, others)  OR, $15 all you can drink bloody marys.  !!  2.) Food is amazing.  Everything we tried we raved about.  Chicken & waffles, short rib hash, scratch-made everything.  Huevos Rancheros will make you want to live here.  3.) Brunch is affordable!  4.) Lots of interesting cocktails as well as daily specials.  If you like food, you should definitely go here.  Now."}
{"text":"Fourth visit and it just seems better every time. Finally tried their charcuterie with cheese. In addition to being on a different planet from store-bought cured meats, M&P's house-cured versions of traditional terrines, hams, forcemeat and garnishes put the carnivorous delicacies served in other major metros to shame. Combined with the kobe+marrow+capers appetizer and it was hard to believe we were in Pittsburgh and not at a coastal foodie mecca (and I've been to a few).  I had the Branzino, which I rarely order because it can be so generic, but I needed to stick with something low-fat for health reasons. Not disappointed in the least. Whole fish, including head, served in a lovely copper dish on top of a kind of ragu of vegetables and small potatoes. Skin on, head on but NO BONES. Stuffed with lemon and herbs. OMG (and I never say OMG) this was so flavorful and easy to eat compared to the usual \"whole fish\" experience.  Will definitely find an excuse to go back again. While service can be lacking on a busy night - the food quality and creativity are worth the wait and then some."}
{"text":"Service was tremendous.    Great drinks...Brussels sprouts were very very good and salmon was cooked perfectly!!!"}
{"text":"We came here for dinner on a Saturday after hearing about their great reviews. We made reservations and were seated promptly without having to wait. For apps, we had the tartar and the bone marrow. I my was my first time having bone marrow and tartar so I did not have anything to compare it to. I did enjoy both dishes and thought they were very flavorful. For main entrees, we ordered the duck and one of their specials. I thought the duck was a bit chewy for my taste, I've definitely had better and would probably would not order it again. The other dish (forget the name) was great and would definitely order again. For dessert, we had the French toast dish. Definitely delicious but felt more like a breakfast option than a dinner dessert option. Their cocktails and service are also great. The portions are definitely large. We left dinner very full. Would come again for a night out/cocktails at their bar."}
{"text":"I have always wanted to try the food here. So when my brother came in to town. They were super busy so I do suggest that you make reservation, I had the ceasar salad, my brother had the brussel to start with then we decided to do the meat for 2, which is amazing. 34oz ribeye it was amazing. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I was in town for a week, and ate there three times! I had the roasted chicken, the pot roast, the pappardelle, and the fall salad. I ate at the bar, where the staff was friendly and made good drinks as well. Mention must be made of the hostesses at the front, who went out of their way to be helpful."}
{"text":"I'm going to give Meat and Potatoes 3.5 stars here.  Before I start my review, I just want to say that there was unusual event that happened while we were dining that I'll try not to affect this review.  There was an altercation at the bar area, which almost ended up in a fight.  It disrupted the whole restaurant and after the culprit was removed from the restaurant, it took someone in my party twice to ask the manager to call the police (the culprit was just standing outside the restaurant) because maybe the manager thought he was kidding the first time? Nonetheless, it didn't ruin the evening and our waiter said in his 2 years working there, nothing like that had ever happened.  Back to the actual review...  I've wanted to go to Meat and Potatoes for as long as I've known they had the 34 oz. ribeye.  The restaurant was somewhat dark and the bar takes up most of the space in the middle of the room, but I've never sat in a more comfortable chair while dining out.  There's an extensive drinks menu, so you'll definitely be able to find something that works for you.  To start, our table got the fried chicken livers, the lobster mac and cheese, and the pierogies.  It was my first time trying chicken livers and they were delicious, as was the mac and cheese (which had a doritos crust that was really surprisingly good).  The pierogies tasted fine, but were cold so we asked the waiter to heat them up and they came back cold again, which was the main negative of the meal and the reason why I didn't give a full 4 stars.  For the entrée, I split the ribeye for two with a party member.  It was exactly like how I envisioned it.  Cooked exactly like how we wanted and the flavor was unbelievable.  It came with potato wedges and bone marrow, which were delicious as well.  Just a heads up, though (which I didn't know until we ordered), that the ribeye for two takes up to an hour to cook.  We weren't in any rush, so that was fine and it obviously makes sense because it's a massive piece of meat."}
{"text":"Great Lunch in the Cultural District!! Had the Thai Steak Salad and it was amazing!! Perfect size for lunch, and tasted delicious! Service was great and quick. We made a reservation, and it was needed for lunch since the tables got filled fast. The bar area was still open however. The overall feel, look, and atmosphere of Meat and Potatoes is like none other in Pittsburgh!!!"}
{"text":"A highly reputed restaurant in Pittsburgh, famous for their 45oz ribeye (recommend median-rare, it's more tender, even though the attached photo is cooked median), bone marrow is also another famous dish at Meat & potatoes. I also like their chicken liver, anyone who don't like innards can give it a try, they process the liver well, you won't get that gamey taste. And their desserts are awesome, above my expectations. Reservations highly recommended, and do it early!! it's impossible to get seated by walk-ins."}
{"text":"Thanks fellow Yelpers!!  After reading so many amazing reviews about this place, Ive been dying to try this place. So when work offered me and few coworkers to pick up our dinner tab, I told my coworkers I knew exactly where to take them in the 'burgh! As a side note, this was all their first time in Pittsburgh by the way :)  We were impressed from the very beginning when they brought us the water. I loved that they left a bottle of water on our table. I drink alot of water and am always annoyed when the waitstaff doesn't refill it fast enough at other restaurants. We ordered wings and mac n  cheese to start as appetizers. Both were delicious! The entrees didnt disappoint either. We all ordered something different just so we can try a bite of different dishes. Last but not least, we also ordered a chocolate mousse. Every bite of that dessert was heaven. It went much too fast.  I want to come back again and try more different dishes!"}
{"text":"Finally got around to trying Meat & Potatoes! Overall, we had some great food and drinks, but it did not blow me away. I would probably choose to go somewhere else for a nice dinner, just based on my own preferences for fish and lighter fare, but we had a good experience overall. Service was friendly and attentive, but we were there for early dinner before it got hectic. The cocktails were tasty and strong, but I didn't see anything too unique. I would say that the drafts were a little disappointing as they only had two or three on tap that were not IPAs.  In more detail are the dishes we sampled:  **Special Shrimp and Shishito Pepper Appetizer** 3/5 This dish was okay, but the shrimp was very salty.   **Smoked Buffalo Wings** 4/5  Solid wings, with crispy exterior and moist, smoked flesh.   **Wagyu Flat Iron Steak** 4/5 The steak itself was phenomenal and cooked perfectly, but the accompanying potatoes and sauce were way too salty!  **Special Black Squid Ink Pasta** 3/5 Pasta was cooked a little too soft and the shrimp was over salted. The sauce was milder and less salty, which helped balance the dish, but overall was not too impressed.   **Pub Burger** 5/5  Get this! I heard only happy mumbles as my eating companions scarfed down this massive burger. I've heard great things about the burger and was not disappointed.   **Vanilla Panna Cotta** 4/5 I'm used to softer Panna cotta but I enjoyed this slightly firmer version with Apple butter and granola on top. It wasn't what I would expect on Panna cotta but it somehow worked."}
{"text":"I finally came here for the first time for my birthday. I ordered their salmon. Ooh it's so freaking delicious. I love how they cook their black rice so soft but yet not soggy. The salmon was cooked medium, just the way I like it. And the combination with the spicy Korean sauce and fried egg. It was perfect! I didn't order anything else unfortunately but I'm already excited for my next visit here. I've heard so many good things about this place. My boyfriend got their lamb meatball, he loves it except for he thinks it's too many mint leaves. We had such a great experience overall, except one little thing. The menu said the lamb meatball was $20 and they ended up charging us $22. They later on fixed it after we told them. Look carefully next time. I don't think this happens often, but it's strange! I know it's $2 but all the waiters and waitresses should know the price that's on the menu."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere is rustic with a warm feel. The staff is helpful and a attentive..worth the wait .. Farm to table concept. Excellent drinks made fresh .. I should have made a reservation. Looking forward to something delicious"}
{"text":"The service was great, but the food was even better.  I would go there in again in a heartbeat.  I have food allergies and they were great about handling them.  The atmosphere is nice as well.  I ordered the flat iron steak, hands down it was the best steak of my life.  It was cooked to perfection and seasoned perfectly."}
{"text":"I liked this trendy restaurant.  Some of the seating is a little close, with servers bumping into you every now and then and it can be loud with all the hard surfaces and very few soft ones.  It took quite a while for our server to show up but they were very busy.  The food was good prepared with a lot of imagination and the signature drinks were fun to try.  Great oasis in downtown Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Meat & Potatoes was definitely the best meal I had while visiting Pittsburgh! Loved the ambiance of the restaurant, definitely a great place to go for date night or to celebrate a special occasion.  Cocktails (4/5): We all enjoyed our drinks and the prices weren't too bad either.  Caesar Salad (5/5): highly recommend ordering, it was amazing! The crunchy pork rinds and crispy pig ears complimented the salad perfectly and the addition of the egg was also unique.  Roasted Duck Breast (4/5): really enjoyed the duck, it was cooked and seasoned perfectly. However, I don't eat polenta so I asked to sub a side potato dish instead which the server said I could, but did not inform me that there would be an additional $4 charge for this. Would have been nice to know.  45 oz Ribeye for Two (3.5/5): the first ribeye they brought out was rare so we had to send it back. I found it odd that the bone marrow wasn't served with any toast or bread because it was really oily eating it by itself. Chimichurri and horse radish sauces were decent.   Truffle Fries (5/5): great fries, loved the aioli.  Overall a great spot for dinner downtown. Will be back the next time I come to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Lived in PGH when it opened. Moved away, and make sure I visit every time I come back. Great place"}
{"text":"What an amazing dining experience.... ambience, service, food and beverage 5 stars across the board. Im guessing if you've rated this place poorly you probably own a competing restaurant down the block. Seriously, my only complaint, restrooms are in the lobby.    Meat & Potatoes, Pittsburgh..... Holy Mother of God hands down epicurean delight. If you find yourself in this lovely city it would be a heresy not to dine here.   Caesar Salad.... pickled green tomatoes, fried egg, chicharrones, crispy pig ear, Parmesan.  Hudson valley duck breast.... dandelion, almond purée and fried polenta."}
{"text":"Always a great meal, perfect drinks and relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"42oz cowboy steak is out of this world. Split it with a friend although we both agreed that of we go back we might each get one of our own.  Had it with the white truffle butter, which was a good touch, but not necessary. The truffle fries are above average; as a note I'm  usually not wild about truffle fries as they're somewhat over played and underwhelming.  Service was good too, cocktails were all well made and garnished. The wine options offer good variety."}
{"text":"Good service.  We were seated before our reservation time. Wait staff are friendly and helpful.  Now on to the food: seviche appetizer was delicious and fresh.  For main course, we had the flatiron steak and the pork--both perfectly prepared, flavorful, and copious.  About that wine list... If you are going to offer so many options of deliciously prepared meat, it is my opinion that you should have a wine list to go with it.  The regular wine list on the menu is quite limited. The \"special\" wine list that the server showed us after the meal was over (since I asked) was very pricey.  I understand that this establishment is a gastro pub, and focuses on beer and cocktails.  However, it is my opinion that an expanded wine list would greatly improve the quality of the meals, especially if it included options from Italy and France, and at reasonable prices.  There is no reason, in my mind, for a gastro  pub to ignore wine selection!  Otherwise, we have no complaints. I would be remiss if I did not mention that the desserts were delicious, both the lemon berry pie and the chocolate pot de crème."}
{"text":"What a dump!!! When we arrived here we were greeted by an indifferent, teenage hostess who was 100% absorbed in her smartphone... she actually had her feet on the hostess stand! Nice!!! When she deigned to put her petulant eyes on us, she actually scowled at me... Gee, I had the concierge at our 5 star hotel make this reservation (against his advice), as I had read positive yelp reviews about the place. But this individual was truly pissed that we were there, and before long, so was I... The \"restaurant\" was understandably 3/4 empty but the \"hostess\" insisted on seating us on top of another table... Our gracious neighbors insisted that it was \"OK\", if we sat down (practically in their laps) but I explained that we were from out of town and weren't comfortable with banquet seating. Our little snot of a hostess then said we that we \"could sit there or nowhere\", even though there were a ton of empty tables! What? Really??? That was when I noticed the smell in this \"eatery\"! It was an unholy cross between disinfectant, manure and offal...Usually when Satan manifests in the flesh he is accompanied by a strong fecal odor, so I instantly knew that we were in the wrong place and urgently needed to flee... I made the sign of the cross at this vile little creature as we slowly backed up and headed for the door. After running for our lives down the street, we ended up at a wonderful little Italian place where we enjoyed a magnificent meal. Like I said, we're from out of town and should have listened to our concierge who had warned us to avoid, \"Meat and Potatoes like the plague\"! I should have listened... My bad!!!"}
{"text":"Meat & potatoes for two. So SO yum.  Bf and I were here about a month ago for dinner and libations. We ordered the \"build your own\" meat & potatoes for 2 for $75. This sounds like a bit of a hefty price tag but it is so so so worth it. An order includes a 45oz rib eye served next to their signature bone marrow gratin. So tender. So savory. I'm making myself drool just thinking about it. For $2 extra we also got chimchurri sauce (other sauces are available though, depending on your taste) as well as a side of truffle fries and mushroom ragu for an addition $8 apiece. While all that added up pretty quickly, the truffle fries were seasoned to perfection: evenly but not too heavy handedly and definitely some of the best I have had in a long long time. The entire meal was so good and the portions generous enough that we had enough to take home for lunch the next day.  The drinks, however, did not impress me so much. I am far from a connoisseur of craft cocktails, and since I am aware I know nothing, I always ask the experts (aka the bartender). Our bartender that night wasn't super helpful. Based on my preferences, he recommended the dark & stormy but bf was already planning to get that so I asked for another recommendation. He had none. This baffled me because.. I mean, he's the one that makes the drinks right??  I picked something else but didn't care for it and ended up not ordering a second because I was a little put off by that point (and also super stuffed from all the meat & potatoes).  All in all, would definitely recommend giving this place a try. The ambiance is nice. Dark and romantic enough for a nice date or boisterous enough for a girls' night for drinks and chat."}
{"text":"I have now been back numerous times sitting both at tables and at the bar and I am convinced that this is one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh.   Returned with my husband, my sister and her boyfriend for dinner. We were seated at a large table by the kitchen which would usually annoy me from the noise, but the chairs were so comfortable, and it really wasn't that loud!  We couldn't decide what to order, so I suggested we order a bunch of appetizers and small plates and share (a genius call according to my sisters boyfriend) and a few cocktails.    The cocktails that were ordered:  First Word: my new favorite and have ordered each subsequent visit to the restaurant!  Desperado: delicious tequila cocktail, but a definite punch!   The Food:  Fried Pickles (these were good, but my husband has had better)  Fried Brussels (a must order.  Delicious!) Bone Marrow (absolutely amazing!) Tartare (I wasn't a huge fan of the peanuts featured in it, but the beef was delicious)  Risotto (delicious, but more toothsome than other versions I have had)  Caesar Salad (absolutely delicious with a perfectly cooked fried egg and delicious pig ears!) Mussels (delicious and huge!)   Went again last night and had:  First Word cocktail (I can't say enough about this delicious drink!)  Caesar Salad (awesome)  Meat and Potatoes for two (ordered rare and it was spot on!  The bone marrow, mushrooms, and confit potatoes were great accompaniments!)  We will be back over and over again!"}
{"text":"Went here to celebrate my son receiving his 'white coat' at Pitt's pharmacy school. Nice decor and ambience. I think our waiter was new, but that won't impact my impression of this place. Loved the food. Easy to find. A little surprised they don't offer valet parking, but there is an indoor parking lot up the street. I had to try their iconic bone marrow I heard so much about(Travel Channel). It was delicious. Like meat butter, but very fatty if you're health conscious. I was disappointed to hear the 'Tomahawk' steak I'd seen on the Travel Channel was no longer on the menu. I had the Bronzino(head on) as my entrée. I've had this dish many places and some places will filet it for you and remove the head. While the dish was filleted, the head remained on, which adds to the experience. Doesn't bother me. My son had the lamb cassoulet. Very tender and flavorful. I'll definitely get that when I come back."}
{"text":"Loved, loved, loved it here!!! I ate maybe the best sandwich in my life! We started off with smoked wings which were delicious and I got the three little pigs sandwich! I did have to take it off of the bread because the bread was a little bulky for me but the pork was perfect, the bacon pork belly was delicious, the ham was nice, and the egg was just the perfect topping to make everything just right! I was in Pittsburgh for work and I am mad I don't live closer to the sandwich although it's probably better for my health that i'm not!! I will be back though!!"}
{"text":"I know what you're thinking... Seriously, another 5 star review? Why so? Here's the deal folks. This place has consistently been awesome. Dinner: awesome! Brunch: awesome! And drumroll please... Lunch: AWESOME!  There's not many places I can say that about, but they find a way to be creative and deliscious with every meal. I do hope you read all my other reviews on this place for tips on what I thought were gear choice (poutine, cough cough) but for lunch I probably had thee best fish sandwich I've ever had!   They just opened for lunch today and are running a special Lentin menu with fish, fish and more fish... And one burger (seriously, if you don't like fish or a burger you might be screwed till Easter.).   I had the Parmesan fish sammie, which was a generous portion of perfectly battered fish, a VERY generous portion of provolone and tomato sauce. But the crown jewel was the smoked potato salad side dish. Again, generous portion of some of the most delectable and inventive potato salad I've ever had! The smoked taste stayed with me for a while after, but rather than garlic breathe, it was actual a reminder how, oh. My. Gawd. Amazing it was! To be continued...."}
{"text":"This was a fun place with good drinks and people generally having fun.  The food?  It was OK.  The idea is apparently to reclaim old classics, with things on the menu like chicken pot pie and devils on horseback.  The pot pie was fine, although it seemed overpriced at $20.  The sweetbreads were OK, but lacked the silky delicacy you expect from them.  The fries that accompanied the burger were limp and uninteresting.  It's really not bad, and it was fun -- everyone in the restaurant seemed to be enjoying themselves, and there was a great friendly vibe.  The service was attentive if not particularly effusive."}
{"text":"Never thought we would be able to eat at Meat & Potatoes with the rave reviews we are reading on Yelp. Stopped in late Saturday night and was able to sit at the bar. Wow were we lucky, Top notch atmosphere, Great libations, first class service and the food couldn't be better. Being late we went with a few small items. The César salad was the best we ever had.  the chicharrones and crispy pig ear really sets it apart from other César's. Then off the bartenders recommendation we went with the pork dish, very enjoyable. Wow what a great place, wish we were closer!"}
{"text":"I must say....I adore this place!!! The food is always great...staff fantastic. I went 2x's in one week...that's how much I enjoy this place. The fried pickles and brussel sprouts.....yuuuuummm!!!! The drinks fun...strong...and delish. I cant rave anymore about this place. I took friends last night and they want to go back.....they drank the kook aid."}
{"text":"This is a very trendy restaurant - Gastropub.  The food we enjoyed was quite tasty.  We sat at the bar because it was a busy evening with post college graduation diners filling the place.  The mixologist provided much entertainment.  My only complaint is that they did not have non-alcoholic beer."}
{"text":"We definitely waited too long to try this place. It was marvelous. Great atmosphere, delicious food. I have no complaints whatsoever! Great spot for a date night, and had a fun crowd too. Waiters were attentive and polite. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Expected a typical steak place, in fact, just one steak item on the menu. Started with a fantastic punch from the bowl right on the bar, drinks are unique & very good selection of microbrews. Fried Brussel sprouts were excellent as was mushroom risotto. Hubby's steak was good but lukewarm. Lose a star for hipper-than-thou staff - which I think is the concept but unfortunately came with the  attitude to match. Tables were tiny & jammed up against each other. We gave up our table, moved to the bar, and had a very good experience."}
{"text":"I want to go back again and again and again. Everything was so delicious! It was a flavorful feast! Manhattan, fried Brussels, bone marrow, Hudson Valley Duck, and chocolate mousse dessert. Wow."}
{"text":"Damn, can this place do brunch! I've been to a number of brunch places around the Pittsburgh area and this one might well be my favorite.  Let's start with the ambiance. Perfect lighting, not too bright and not too dim. Great for those coming to eat to cure themselves of their hangovers. The music playing were those AWESOME 90s jams we all love and keep near and dear to our hearts (you know that Lifehouse, Matchbox 20, and Third Eye Blind!).  I went with 3 other friends and was seated at the bar and greeted by friendly bartenders. We ordered the following: shrimp and grits, 2 orders of chicken and waffles, and scrambled eggs with potato gratin. Oh and of course some mimosas and bloody Marys (because, duh, it's brunch).   I did not have the fortune of tasting the shrimp and grits but the friend who ordered it said, and I quote, \"I wish that never had to end\". So, I'm guessing it was pretty freaking good. The friend who received the scrambled eggs said they were the best he had ever had.  Now, onto the chicken and waffles. WOOWEE. These chicken and waffles gave meaning to my life. I had a reason to live. To love. To write this review. First, the chicken...the amount they gave us, you would've thought they gave us the whole damn farm! Like 4 HUGE pieces of chicken topped on a giant Jalapeño waffle (jalapeño in a waffle?! The future is now, people) with a side of bourbon-bacon maple syrup. This entire thing lasted me for at least another 2 meals. Talk about getting your money's worth!  Onwards to service! So friendly and nice. When they took our plates, you would've thought we were doing THEM a favor by having our plates removed. Bartenders were great, they talked to us, but not in a forced way and kept us entertained with their mixology while we waited patiently for our food.   Bottom line, this place is wonderful. All the hype Meat and Potatoes gets is honestly all true. What an excellent dining experience and quite affordable too (at least brunch was)! Highly recommend this place, whether or not you need a pick-me-up from an all night bender or just want a nice casual, but classy brunch. Definitely looking forward to returning here again!"}
{"text":"I had heard a lot about this place so we tried it out for the first time on a Saturday. We made reservations about 2 weeks in advance and they only had a 5:15 and 7:30 at that point so I would def. make reservations if you plan on eating here.   Pros: -Really cool interior design- industrial/glamorous feel to it. -The food- the food is Delicious. The combined flavors on everything is just awesome. I had the roasted chicken, my husband at the pot roast, and we split the cheese plate as an appetizer. It was all awesome. The cheese plate came with 2 different cheeses (I believe blue cheese was one of them with a sea salt on it), some delicious walnuts, fig? , and a spread with toast. It really hit the spot!   Cons: -Very tight seating. You will be about 1 foot away from other tables on both sides of you and when a waiter is at that other table, their behind will be in your face. Not a big deal but if your someone that is bothered by tight spaces and like your privacy, you will want to skip this place. -Bloody Mary- I was excited to see they had a bloody mary bar but found out it was only for brunch. I decided to order one anyway because I figured it would still be awesome. I mean, they have all the toppings for it still! Wrong- the drink was weak, not spicy, and was served with a lemon wedge and a tiny green olive. No cucumber, pepper ring, nothing. I thought they would at least throw a few things on a toothpick in the drink  Overall, I would come back here again for dinner, however I would skip the drinks or maybe try a drink they specialize in on their menu rather than ordering something off the menu."}
{"text":"Stopped by here a few times on our weekend visit. Fell in love with the bone marrow/meat butter.  It's insanely good.  Atmosphere is great and service was wonderful!  Also, had the best drink ever - smoked honey bee!  Get it."}
{"text":"Never a bad experience here. We tend to get the pork chop and scallops if offered. But you can't go wrong with any dish! The Brussels sprouts and risotto are staple too! Drinks are delicious and the atmosphere is perfect"}
{"text":"This has become one of my favorite brunch spots. I love the venue, and service has been solid for the most part. I typically spend a few minutes debating what to get before deciding on short rib hash, but there are so many good things on the menu I am always tempted to switch it up. The quiche changes every day and is always good and oh my gosh - the flat bread... both the salmon and the brisket are a great way to start the way.  I'm not a huge bloody mary fan myself, but that's what M&P is famous for so while you're here, definitely try one. If you are in need of coffee, try the Irish Breakfast. The whipped cream is made fresh and maple-flavored.  And last, whatever you do, remember that there is NOTHING wrong with eating dessert after every meal, including breakfast so save room for whatever dessert they are serving. I rarely recommend splitting dessert (since I hate sharing it) but in this case I'd say half a cupcake is plenty."}
{"text":"The food was AMAZING! One of the best duck breasts I have ever eaten. The service was impeccable. The ONLY reason my rating is not a 5 is because I was with a group and we were in a small room and it echoed and got pretty noisy between my party and the rest of the restaurant. But other than that, it was amazing!"}
{"text":"Was in town to celebrate my brothers birthday which fortunately/unfortunately fell on Easter this year. Not many places were open for dinner and after walking aimlessly around downtown Pittsburgh for an hour we literally stumbled upon this place. We walked in scanned the menu quickly and were seated right after.   The drink options/specials were reasonably priced at $7 to $9 and the ambiance was great. All the hostess and waiters seemed welcoming.   The food. The food. The food. Unfortunately, the menu item I ordered isn't listed on M&P's website. It doesn't seem like they've updated since 2017 but I can say that my dish was I believe a lamb chop with either quinoa or couscous. There were a variety of vegetables and sauces and the flavors were SO GOOD. The flavor I cannot speak enough about. I really did savor every bite. My brother ordered the pappardelle and said although the pasta was a little bit more on the dente side of al dente, it was still very delicious.   This is for sure a place I'd return to for another speical occassion."}
{"text":"We've been itching to return for dinner here because the food was so memorable the first time. We were not disappointed. The steak and salmon entrees were both outstanding. Nice specialty cocktail too. If you're looking for vegetable dishes, you'll be limited here. Fun for a dinner date before a show!"}
{"text":"This is a place perfect for only drinks at the bar and some appetizers . Loved the atmosphere and the interior.  It's so over rated though,sorry to say. I was there yesterday and I had some steak,brussels n fries! Omg so saltyyy and the steak was cold and I could smell the cow! It was gross I couldn't eat it! Don't go there to eat!"}
{"text":"There are alot of reviews for this delicious restaurant - there are a few things worth knowing ahead of time because they may not quite be your cup of tea... 1. They do great mixed drinks but the beer and wine list is subpar, so opt for a cocktail. 2. The food is delicious, some of the flavor combinations are unconventional twists on familiar comfort food - go with your instincts on whether it sounds fun or not tasty. 3. They are almost always crowded...make a reservation.  The service is great if you have a reservation but I suspect much disappointment if you don't. 4. The menu does change but when we've been there's not alot in the way of vegetables on the menu."}
{"text":"Ribeye phenomena:  This is definitely a unique dish that you probably won't experience somewhere else. It's designed for two big hungry dudes or 2 steelers maybe. It's a 34 oz bone-in ribeye topped with mushroom Ragu, bone marrow gratin and confit fries. FYI, for metric system folks, 34 oz ~ 1 kg. Warning: it's a giant dish!. We boxed half of it.  Seriously, you can't order this if you're going out on a date with a delicate fine lady. It looks exactly like a dinner for a Viking king. People sitting around us were curiously uninhibitedly staring at the dish.  It was delicious! Although I wasn't a fan of the mushrooms on top. The meat was perfectly cooked, juicy and tender. Bone marrow was wonderful!. Confit fries were not good. They were hard, overcooked, soaked with fat and bland. My suggestion for improvement is to eliminate the fries or use regular fries like McDonald's. Some people like the mushrooms topping, personally I think it was unnecessary. A good steak doesn't need any topping other than salt and pepper.   We walked in around 5 pm without a reservation. Waited for 45 minutes, spent it walking around the pretty Cultural District. Pittsburgh has a Chicago or New York touch. Atmosphere here is classic. Bar area is in the middle and seats are around it in a rectangle shape. We asked the waitress to change our seats from a tiny table to a bigger one. That was thankfully granted.   During my brisk visit with Pittsburgh, I wanted to pay one of my good friends back. He genuinely showed extraordinary hospitality. You can never pay nice people back. But it was a good hint coming here."}
{"text":"Wow...!  I can only comment on the food as we got in without a reservation and we were therefore seated in the back room.  No ambiance at all.  Still.  Food was the mission and we did not care much about the decor and the music.  So, the back room was kind of a plus.  You can read the menu all you want but your waiter is your best friend.  There was four of us and we all got a smile on our faces at one point or another going through some of the dishes she suggested.  I started with the tartare.  When it came in, i realized that this was going to be different.  In a good way. A must...  Then i went for the mussels.  It was addictive.  The broth was tomato-bacon ish (can't remember what it was called).  The chef is realy creative.  I would be curious to see what would happen if he exchanged or cooked with Martin Picard of Le Pied de Cochon...  Wine list ok.  Service was friendly but not as attentionate as you would expect given the price tag."}
{"text":"Meat and Potatoes is my number one celebration date night in Pittsburgh. The food is incredible - I recommend the $3 bread with duck butter and apple butter to start. I've had the mussels, the pub burger and the chicken sandwich. All were insane.. some of the best food I've ever had at a restaurant hands down.   Make a reservation and spend the next week or two counting down the days - it's that good!"}
{"text":"I love beer and good food. I was looking forward to eating here for awhile before i go my opportunity. The food was great, the bone marrow was better than anticipated. I was a little, okay really sad that all their beers in bottles and have none on tap. That being said Meat & Potatoes is by far the best restaurant in the Cultural District. Surrounded by upscale restaurants that serve bland food, in corporately designed dining rooms, with mediocre service M&P shines as genuine and brilliant. This place is always busy every day so either go early for lunch/brunch be ready to wait your turn."}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous experience!  We had a party of 12 for a work function in there last night.  Emily was our server and did very well, the food was incredible and fair prices for the quality and quantity that we received.  Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Great little fusion american / pub spot.  Very swanky feel with a hipster vibe, so much so that a majority of the employees dawned thick framed eye wear and full beards.  Overall a rather small restaurant, the bar and dining area seemed rather squeezed together in a mosh posh fashion.  Most of the food was great, the chicken liver appetizer was crispy, the burgers were juicy, cooked correctly and delicious, and the brisket had an excellent smoked flavor with plenty of fat.  I gleefully approve of their use of goat cheese in a number of dishes.  The pasta dishes, however, seemed to fall a bit flat.  Dessert cheesecake was served in a cleaned out candle / mason jar, equally as tasty as it was awkward to receive.  Fries were mediocre, overly cooked and a touch salty.  Also, there could have been a larger draft beer selection. I certainly applaud them on their interesting take on a number of mildly mundane dishes though, makes for a unique dining experience.  Prices were reasonable, the wait wasn't long, the staff was tremendously friendly and service was excellent.  Absolutely worth checking out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for our date night and I absolutely enjoyed the food. We started off with the Fried Pig Ears as a snack.  The sweet Thai chili sauce it was in was delicious and I could not stop eating the pig ears. It was garnished with cilantro and thin slices of quick pickled cucumbers. The acidity balanced the sweetness of the sauce.   For our entree, we built our own Meat & Potatoes for Two, which includes a 45 oz rib eye and bone marrow gratin. Everything exceeded our expectations! We ordered the steak with the house steak sauce, mashed potatoes, and a side of the roasted cauliflower. The bone marrow gratin was very rich and flavorful and paired well with the steak.  We ordered a medium-rare rib eye and it was very tender and juicy.  The house steak sauce was like a combination between A1 and Ketchup. The roasted cauliflower had a sweet flavor and it was delicious.   We booked reservations a week before to make sure we could eat here. The rib eye with the additional sides ended up being around $120. The food was absolutely delicious that we were happily paying for it."}
{"text":"Dined here last night with some business colleagues and really enjoyed it. Great atmosphere, awesome food and good service!"}
{"text":"First, the negative. My entree arrived an hour and ten minutes after we sat. Our server was nice enough, but was too busy and distracted to get our full order until the appetizer was on the table and half gone. We ordered the appetizer as soon as he greeted us, and it came quickly, so that was quite a long wait for the main course.  That was my only complaint, and if the service had been on point, this would be a five star review. A few quibbles follow but didn't change my enjoyment of the experience.  For an appetizer we split fried brussels spouts. Delicious. (The sauce was pretty bland, but not needed.) My cocktail was also damn tasty. I ordered and aviation, but John recommended something different - whatever it was I liked it. Our entree was the meat and potatoes for two. What that looked like was about a pound of steak fries, cooked in fat or tallow. On top was a cowboy ribeye about the size of a cow, cooked right to temerature, covered with a slew of mushrooms sauteed in garlic and more fat, and a nice sized marrow bone split in half and roasted with cheese. This was served with ketchup and the house steak sauce which was delicious, even though I like meat best unadorned. All of the above was executed amazingly.   My bf also ordered a side of mashed potatoes. These were tasteless. Also, the table was too small to hold both the huge platter of meat and potatoes and plates, so we ate from the serving tray. This made it awkward to eat in a civilized fashion, but the food was so amazing I would have eaten with my hands if I needed to.  Executive summary: delicious food, but served too slowly."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try Meat & Potatoes for a long time now and finally had the opportunity to go to brunch last weekend on Sunday.  My friend and I had reservations for 2 people at noon, and we were seated promptly.  I had no idea what to expect, but given the reviews and my ideas of the place comparing it to other upscale restaurants in the area, I was wholly unprepared for the extremely loud music that assaulted our ears as we entered the dining area - the place was fairly crowded with people, but even with that the music drowned out the voices of everyone and it was difficult for us to even hear one another.  My friend has a medical condition that is exacerbated by loud noises (which had I known about the music volume here I would never have suggested eating here), and while the manager did kindly lower the volume a bit even with that, it was still uncomfortably loud even for me and I don't have the health issue that my friend does.  I despise going out to eat only to have my eardrums beaten down with loud music that makes it nearly impossible to have a conversation with the people you are with but given the very intimate nature of the seating (you are practically on top of the people next to you) I guess that the restaurant opted for loud music versus involuntarily eavesdropping on the patrons next to you.  So, as far as ambiance goes I rate it a 2 because of the too close seating and the loud music plus the tables are so small that it's nearly impossible to fit even 2 plates with drinks on each 2-seat dining table.   Our server, whose name I don't remember was great - he was very attentive and accommodating.  I have zero complaints on the service.  The food was hit or miss, though the prices were comparable with local fine dining restaurants that serve Sunday brunch.  My friend wanted to try the fried taters so we decided to share those and this was by far my favorite part of our whole meal. The fries were well-seasoned and crispy on the outside while the center was still warm and soft - they were nearly the perfect french fries!  I'm not a big fan of aioli in general but their truffle mayo had a great flavor.  I had coffee, and it was decent coffee, but it wasn't great - there are much better cups of coffee at other restaurants around Pittsburgh but it was okay once I added cream and sugar.  I ordered the shrimp and grits as my entree and my friend ordered the roast beef eggs benedict with house hollandaise.  The shrimp and grits is covered in etouffee which I didn't really like as it overpowered the creaminess of the cheddar grits and detracted from the typical flavor of a traditional shrimp and grits.  It wasn't bad - I just didn't like the two flavor combinations together.  My friend said that the hollandaise sauce was lacking but at the same time she didn't mind because she said that it didn't taste like a traditional hollandaise sauce and that she wasn't happy with the flavor of it, but that she didn't mind the dish, but would have preferred no sauce or a traditional hollandaise instead.  The overall experience was a bit disappointing and underwhelming particularly given that I have heard so many good things about the place.  I would definitely go back if invited, but I won't make it a point to go here when there are so many other great restaurants in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"J and I came here for fancy dinner night one Sunday. It happened to be the same night as a Steeler's game so the restaurant was pretty packed. Even with reservation, we had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated, which was a bit annoying. The ambiance was nice overall. The decorations were great and we loved the worn mirrors along the wall. Because it was so packed and the tables were so close together, it was difficult for J and I to have conversations. It was easier to have conversations with the people seated next to us. J and I started our meal with grilled bread and friend taters, which were pretty decent. For our main meal, J ordered the pot roast and I had the roasted chicken. Overall the food was pretty good. Very flavorful and large portions, which was great because we had lunch for the following day.  For dessert, I had a lemon berry custard cake and J had the chocolate mouse. Both were delicious. I think if we went on a less busy day, we may have had a better experience."}
{"text":"You would love this place!! Ordered fried Brussels for an app then mussels (curry, lemongrass, chili, lime, coconut milk and cilantro) with frites and black truffle mayo  App was $5 and mussels were $16... Really not too bad"}
{"text":"I've been to Meat and Potatoes several times for dinner and it always surprises me how good their food is. The chicken and dumplings special was amazing, the Pappardelle is delicious. And you can never go wrong with the Sgt. Pepper's Old Fashion!"}
{"text":"Impressive...so impressive. Another place that makes me gloat about how cool Pittsburgh is.   There was a bit of a mix up with reservations, and the room we'd requested wasn't available. Because of this mistake, though, the manager made sure we were seated, and our party was comped appetizers. Good business!   Those apps were divine: mushroom flatbread, tuna tartare tacos, fries...we passed them around again and again, our eyes telling the story of our love for them.   I had never eaten dinner here before, so I was really excited, and I ordered the pot roast. It's meat and potatoes, people. I'm not leaving here without some mash! While I was waiting on the dinner, I tried the 25th hour cocktail, a blend of gin and citrus that I would love to recreate at home. M&P is well-known for their creativity behind the bar, and tonight did not disappoint.   Now for the meal! OMG. Meat was tender and juicy, and it sat on a bed of the most perfect consistency of mashed potatoes one could ask for. The plate was adorned  with a gravy that brought the whole dish together, and I was in glutton heaven. It was a special occasion, and I hit the gym the next day :)  Of course, we didn't stop there. To complete the celebration of the evening, the table ordered each of the three desserts to share: panacotta, Heath bar, and chocolate Oreo. Each of these desserts comes in a mason jar and is packed with deliciousness. Everyone had a different fav.   Service was outstanding!  Five stars, well-deserved."}
{"text":"oh my, I can't believe I like this place.  No really, I'm not a meat and potatoes kind of girl.  In fact I'm not a meat kind of girl.  I really should be a vegetarian - but I'm not.  I'll take a piece of chicken any day slather in sauce, so I don't actually taste the meat ;).  Anyways, I met up with some friends here.  I tried everything I could eat on the menu, and I was in love.  Simply it was divine.  They have also started doing lunch on Fridays during Lent, unfortunately it's over.  I hope they bring it back and soon!  My suggestion is to come here with friends, and try a bit of everything, so you get a feel of what do you do like.  I particularly enjoy their fish sandwiches (during lunch), fried pickles, and moules and frites.  They make some killer cocktails, and the servers and owner are extremely friendly.  I even spotted the entire Steelers O-line here one evening, it's definitely a hot spot!"}
{"text":"Meat & Potatoes is a damn good spot! I came here with colleagues while I was in town for a convention. The service was spot on and the food was DELICIOUS!! I highly recommend eating at Meat &Potatoes if you visit or live in Pittsburgh.  What we had * Meatloaf - Slap your Grandmom twice if she tries to get a taste. This dish was amazing! 5 stars  * Pork Chop - Huge! Definitely will have leftovers. The pork chop was juicy and tender. 5 stars  * Three Little Pigs Sandwich - When we saw the size of this sandwich we were like WHOA! The sandwich was big enough for 2 people to eat. And the fact that it had bacon, Pork Milanese and ham made the sandwich that much more amazing! 5 stars  * French Toast Dessert- This was a let down! The only good thing about this dish was the ice cream. 2.5 stars"}
{"text":"I would have given 4 or even 5 stars had our service been good, but it was really inattentive, lackluster and more typical of Eat and Park than a more upscale restaurant reputed to be one of the city's best. We waited 10 minutes for just water, then 15 minutes for our drinks. It was busy but that was too long to wait.  The brunch menu was offered but we were never told the specials (in fact, as it was my first time there I didn't know there were specials.)  We learned of them only after our waiter recited them to our table neighbors, 2 men, who came in and were immediately waited on after we had finally ordered. They sounded tasty, and I would have ordered one had I known. The waiter never came back to us until we were done, even though he chatted amicably with the neighbors. Had we wanted or needed anything, we were left to keep wanting/needing it. Only the water and food servers appeared to pour or deliver. I guess a 2nd mimosa was out of the question. I haven't experienced this attitude in Pittsburgh for a long time and was frankly astonished. I suspect it was that we were 2 women on our way to the theater, but who knows? We were dressed well and are friendly to servers so there was no attitude from us. The reason doesn't really matter though; it only matters that it was unreasonable. We allowed 2 hours and it's a good thing we did. The food & drinks were excellent, the younger crowd was buzzing, music loud and energetic - very fun atmosphere. Portions are huge - ridiculously so. However, the most ordinary service, on a day of a small celebration, was a huge disappointment. I would give it one more chance because my husband would love this place. Hopefully there won't be a repeat of that service."}
{"text":"Made a reservation at 6:30 on a Thursday night. Very glad we did because as we were checking in with the hostess, she was turning away several people. (The next opening, I overheard, was at 9:30). Lesson learned. Always make a reservation.   We were seated at a very small table along the wall and ordered apertifs. As an appetizer, boy and I chose the artesian cheese board with bread and rhubarb jam. All the cheeses (one cow, one sheep, and one goat) were very tasty especially when paired with the jam and walnuts. Note, this appetizer was rather small so expect it to only feed two.   I ordered the duck breast and boy chose the pappardelle pasta. I was informed that the duck was usually served medium-rare, which I thought a bit dodgy for a poultry item. I asked them to prepare it medium. The duck was very flavorful, and served with a few sauerkraut pierogies and chimicurri sauce. Yum! Boy's pasta was also good. The bolognese/pork shoulder sauce was very savory and rich. I usually enjoy cheese on my pasta, but I guarantee you will NOT need it with this dish.   To finish, we shared a peanut butter parfait. It was so rich, we couldn't finish it!   I saw so many other menu items I would like to try (not to mention the mussels), so we will be returning!   The food is five-star. I docked Meat and Potatoes one because the service tends to be a bit slow and the atmosphere is LOUD. I wish I could give it an extra half star because the bartenders dress like they walked off the set of Newsies. And who doesn't love Newsies?"}
{"text":"We dined here with friends during summer restaurant week 2013. We had a great experience. They had a new special menu each night during restaurant week. We were there for Mexican night. The night started with a tequila shooter (always a good start!). Next we tried several courses of delicious Mexican entrees and dessert. All of the food was full of flavor. It was obvious that they also work hard on presentation as well. Overall, a very fun experience. It would be fun to try the restaurants regular menu as well."}
{"text":"First time to Pittsburgh and grateful I came here. Absolutely incredible. Tartar and smoked pork chop were arguably the best I've ever have. Great cocktails as well. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Tartar was fantastic. Red snapper was delicate and flavorful - almost a ceviche flavor. Hanger steak was red and juicy. Also had a sidecar here, which was excellent. Seating is a bit cramped, but overall a great experience."}
{"text":"If you're looking to eat come here. You'll get a healthy amount of portions with your entrees. The website recommended making reservations so I made one through Yelp (thanks Yelp ).   Order: Pork - A huge pork chop with sweet spicy collard greens. Topped with a sauce that had a bit of a tangy and mint taste to it. I can't forget to mention the two pieces of perfectly good pork slices on the top of the chop. Those two pieces were the highlight of the meal. The waiter ensured I was aware of possibly raw pieces. It seemed to be cooked pretty good when I cut through it. This takes me to cutting the pork. It was tough to cut through the thick piece of meat. Perhaps a better knife would have helped. I made it through half of the pork chop before I called it quits from being stuffed.   Wagyu - This fine piece of meat was delicious. This entree was the only entree that did not come with as much portions as the others. It was satisfying though. It came with a mashed type of potatoes with a light sauce.   Three Little Pigs - This was a pretty big sandwich full of different types of pork, cheese and a fried egg. It was pretty good. My daughter ordered it so I ended up cutting it for her since it was big and thick. She enjoyed it.   Don't forget the dessert! Peanut Butter and Jelly cheesecake is a must! It was so yummy. It was topped with peanuts so if you're not a big fan you may want to remove them. After all it's peanut butter and jelly! I enjoy it.   Service was pretty good. Our waiter checked us frequently and was nice.   Reservations:  One thing I found odd was reservations for a party of 2 showed 8pm was available and when I edited it to a party of 3 it changed it significantly to 9pm. I called the restaurant to check if I could go at 8 and they said 9 was the earliest for a party of 3. We got to the restaurant, a bit early (they were cleaning our table at 8:50). We were offered a table outside in order to sit immediately. The table we sat at could fit a total of 4. Why weren't we offered to sit there in order to be seated at 8pm - I'm not sure. It wasn't an option given over the phone. In my situation it wasn't a deal breaker. We came at 9pm. However it could have been a deal breaker for others.   The reviews mention it's not kid friend. I believe because it's only open for dinner and has a huge bar. We didn't get a glimpse inside since we sat outside but the bar appeared to be busy.   Overall we enjoyed our dinner and would come back if we were in the area."}
{"text":"I called to make a reservation over the phone - the host was a doll & actually squeezed myself & my fiancé in earlier by like almost 3 hours. So YEA! Also, I made her laugh when I yelled at my fiancé to put on a nice shirt while on the phone with her to make the reservation. When we came - the hostess knew us immediately. lol We were seated right away. Our drinks were fabulous. My fiancé got the Bambles drink & I got something that I can't remember it's name but was good .... Appetizers --we got fried pickles - delicious! AND... we got bone marrow... I know that's a really weird app combo - but whatever - it was divine. My fiancé got the pub burger which he loved, except he wasn't feeling the pork patty on the burger. I got the salmon with an asian flavor infusion with a fried egg. I know that sounds also -- very odd but I am not addicted & cannot CANNOT wait to go back to have that salmon dish again as soon as humanly possible. It was epic in my mouth good. A MUST to order.  Did I mention this was our first time there, btw??? We'll definitely be back & be back SOON."}
{"text":"We celebrated our daughters and new son in laws engagement brunch here.  The food is so great!! I had the hash brisket breakfast and morning mule.  Drinks are fresh and light and the service was great.   We will be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Made reservations via open-table and were seated immediately. Ordered the bone marrow and mussels of the day for an appetizer. Both were delicious. The main course was even better--- we got the meat & potatoes entree for two. It was absolutely perfect-- I'd go as far to say better than the steak we got a Ruth's Chris for Valentine's day."}
{"text":"Visiting my wife's nephew in Pittsburgh for New Years weekend. Googled best restaurants in Pittsburgh...Meat & Potatoes popped up as # 1, read the reviews called for reservation was able to get a seating for 12/30 @ 10:45PM - actually pretty close to our normal dinner time these days about 9 - 9:30PM. In the meantime nephew made reservations for play 'The Toxic Avenger' for 7:30PM. During the course of the day we passed Meat & Potatoes & stopped in to see if could be bumped to an earlier seating - snagged a table for 5 for 9:30PM - play 7:30 - 9:30PM next door!  Finally decided on dinner: Appetizer - Fried Pickle, Fried Pigs Ears, Poutine, Caesars salad Entree - Thia Mussels in spicy coconut broth, Lamb Neck Cassoulet, Wild Mushroom Risotto, Roasted Chicken & special Chicken and Dumplings + dessert  Let me say this - This place is a well honed lean, mean working machine. The service was fast & courteous. The wait staff knew their products. When the food arrived the servers new exactly who was getting what. The same happened with our after dinner drinks - no questions who's drink is...   Now to the food we go: Fried Pickle - delish, with a slight kick, Fried Pigs Ears - yum, crunchy, Poutine - oh my my, love, love poutine ever since I was introduced to it some decades ago in Canada & this was deeeeelish also.  Mussels - extra spicy as requested, yum finger lick'in good (wrong product). They were absolutely delicious. The cassoulet, fall of the bone. Risotto - yum, both chicken dishes - finger lick'in good."}
{"text":"The thing that I really want to talk about when it comes to Meat & Potatos is the seating. If you want a food review you can read one of the many others. I want to say something about the seating.   I really don't like sitting really closely to other people. There are many 2 person tables that pretty much line the border of the restaurant. So you are basically eating with the people on your left and right so it makes for a poor experience when you sit next to overly chatty people who want to talk to you and or when you're sitting next to drunk people.   Also I don't know what the waiter looked like because he was literally standing directly behind me the entire meal, because I was facing the wall and there is no room to take the order from the side of the table because the waiter's butt would be in the faces of the table next to you. That is a little annoying to me.   I wish the seating was better but over all it was a good experience and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped in here on a stopover through Pittsburgh. I did my research beforehand and was super excited to try this place. By the time we made it there from our 4 hour drive I was starving. We were seated right away and the ambiance was really cool. Unfortunately that was the most exciting part of my experience there. The mussels seemed to be very touted on the menu and the specials so I thought I would give it a try. I was a little disappointed as the flavor just wasn't there. My boyfriend ordered the tacos per other reviewers suggestions and they were so overly greasy that even between the two of us (who are big greasy fast food fans) we were only able to eat 2 out of the 3. Albeit I admit that since we went to a place called \"meat and potatoes\" we probably should have ordered something more red meat related. Maybe we wouldn't have been as disappointed? Who knows...I don't plan on going back to give it a try personally but my recommendation to you if you are planning a trip to meat and potatoes is to stick with the 2 person tomahawk meal and get the full experience....anything else will fall sub par to your expectations."}
{"text":"We had a great experience! Food was great (I had the Pub Burger - it was everything I wanted it to be), drink selection was awesome and our service was spot on. My mother-in-law is not a huge pork fan, however, and she found it really difficult to get something to eat that didn't have pork and ended up just going with the Plain Jane burger."}
{"text":"A staple in Pittsburgh. I go here when I want a filling, hearty meal. When I want a burger, I come here. The pub burger has pork belly, cheese and fried egg. Other menu items have recently been hit or miss. I was not impressed with our last order of mussels-most of the shells were empty with little flavor. My favorite bartender left and since then, service hasn't been the same. It's still a go to spot, especially when I find myself downtown. You can usually grab a few seats at the bar anytime without reservations."}
{"text":"We were in town for one night. We looked online and could not get in until 9pm. I called and talked to the front desk and they were able to squeeze us in at 6:45. Very small place but very cool experience. Thank you to the staff for treating us like regulars."}
{"text":"Loved this place! I was in Pittsburgh for a wedding and we ended up going there twice!  We went Friday night for drinks and appetizers at the bar, and then returned Saturday for brunch. The food and service were both terrific, the outdoor seating was lovely and the bloody mary bar was a huge perk. Will definitely go back if I ever end up in Pittsburgh again"}
{"text":"I love meat and potatoes most times I go. The service can be hit or miss. When it's hit, it's the best restaurant experience. When it's miss, you wonder why your bill is so high! I absolutely enjoy every bite of food I have here!"}
{"text":"First of all, after being told \"Oh my Gosh, I cant believe noones walked in in the last 25 minutes\" by the hostess, and \"Usually reservations are needed two weeksin advance\" (by my buddy), i expected to have gold guilded utensils and bossa nova playing in the background.  In reality I enjoyed the pot roast, La fiera vino, pecan carrot cake, but i most certainly did not appreciate having to sweep off the banquet seating or the fact that it felt like a broke down mattress either :/ im just glad the food was hot and it quieted down by dessert course, oh and that i didnt leave with a spring impaled into my nether region."}
{"text":"Great bar and restaurant located near the theaters. We were seated at the large center bar (this seemed to be the place to be with smaller tables on the outside encircling the bar as another dining option). The bartenders were very friendly and provided great recommendations. The food was tasty and the sandwiches were very reasonably priced. I really enjoyed the pub burger, a massive burger topped with pork belly and egg, that was extremely filling and a great price at $14. The cocktails were also tasty as they provide their own bourbon in their Manhattans. This seemed to be a popular place for tourists and locals alike (lots of people here coming from the Steelers game).  We'd certainly come back here during our next visit to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"OVERRATED! Over priced, over hyped steakhouse. Not worth it. The bone marrow was flavorless, as the steak... The drinks were strong though! Save your money or go to a real steakhouse"}
{"text":"Everyone thinks it's impossible to find a seat here, but the trick is to sit at the bar where you can still order from the full menu! (If you want brunch, make a reservation a few weeks in advance though!) Their specialty is meat; if you couldn't tell by the name, you certainly can see from the menu! I've not had anything bad from here but recommend the appetizers to go with a cocktail from the bar. Much cheaper than ordering an entree."}
{"text":"Had a great table here for our group of eight. A semi private area with a long natural wood table. Ambience is a great mix of chic and natural which is perfect for their food.  My dinner mates had the Wagyu beef and said it was one of the best steaks they ever had. I would 100% agree from just the one bite I had. With the grits and collard greens it was one excellent bite.  I had the pappardelle based on the server's recommendation but was a but disappointed. The dish had chunks of meat and a chunky tomato pancetta sauce but the flavor was a bit more basic than I expected. The noodles were great but overall it was just ok. Wish I had the beef!  Definitely worth a try and it appears Sunday nights are a good secret in terms of avoiding the crowds!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came to Meat and Potatoes about a month ago and did not have a good experience. I left a review on Yelp, and the manager promptly called me to see what they could have done better. I was very happy that she made this gesture, so we decided to give it another shot. The food and the service were wonderful! My boyfriend had the hangar steak and said it was one of the best meals he had had in his life! Definitely make sure you hit up this establishment; just make sure to make a reservation as they book up quickly!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and friendly staff!  Ordered the 34oz ribeye meal for two...it was ginormous! The meat could have used a bit more seasoning. However, the steak sauce was amazing! Sautéed mushrooms were super flavorful and the steak fries were the best I've ever had...super crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, with a hint of rosemary.  They have a great beer and liquor selection, and many signature cocktails.  You can't beat the price for this HUGE steak dinner!"}
{"text":"One of my all-time favorite restaurants to go to in downtown Pittsburgh.  Their menu has a very nice selection of food.  Everything from fancy corn dogs to marrow (I have not yet tried the marrow, but some of my family has and they really enjoyed it).  The atmosphere in the restaurant is quite nice, though the lighting is quite dark so if some people have trouble with that do be aware.  The cocktails available at Meat and Potatoes are also phenomenal.  I personally really enjoy their barrel-aged Manhattans; I don't know the last time I had a Manhattan that good.  Do be warned, you are most likely going to want a reservation, as it gets quite crowded, and you might otherwise have to wait."}
{"text":"Terrific spot and I had a great dinner there. I had the lamb neck which was outstanding. Pig ears? Yup, try them they're fantastic. The bone marrow came highly recommended and some in my party really like it. Personally I didn't. If you're an adventurous foodie, give this place a try."}
{"text":"One of my favorite brunches. Dinner is great too. I've been multiple times and only had a bad experience once."}
{"text":"Exceptional meals. Already a family favorite.  Plan accordingly and make reservations early.  Their popularity is my only complaint. This fabulous destination for a meal isn't a secret so be sure to arrive hungry and call in advance!"}
