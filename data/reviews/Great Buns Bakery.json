{"text":"One of my favorite bakery ,friendly people ,good service . And always fresh.i am highly recommend to everybody go there check it out"}
{"text":"Don't let the logo on the door freak you out. 

It's a drawing of the backside of a fat baker with enormous BUTTOCKS while he (or she, god help her) is bending over an oven.  

It was good for a smile.

Then I went inside and was in the bakery version of Disneyland. 

Too many choices.  I was on vacation and staying in a hotel room.  What was I going to get?  Because I could have bought out the store.  

I settled on an everything bagel, a soft pretzel, a cheese roll and a sourdough roll.

All of them were fantastic.  I wish there was a joint like this in my neighborhood.  Maybe it's best there isn't.  

Because maybe my buns would look like the logo.

If you live in Vegas, go there for bread.  You'd be crazy not to.

If you're out of town and driving home, stop there on the way.  You can nibble the crunchy crusts on that boring drive back to So Cal.  It'll make the time go by faster.

Note to the owners:  If you can, try and sell some butter and cream cheese on site.  You'd be doing us a big favor!"}
{"text":"Exceeded our expectations! Very cheap, very fresh, very high quality. You'd be hard pressed to find anything better! We returned to stock up before our trip was over, bought a few more cheese danish (we know better now that we should each get our own), and opted for a large loaf of the white chocolate raspberry bread this time to bring back home. So good!"}

{"text":"I love this place and you can't beat $1.59 day old bread that is ten times better than the grocery stores."}
{"text":"Wanted something sweet after a pleasing meal at Sammy's L.A. Pastrami. Looked to Yelp for a nearby place and came upon Great Buns Bakery. The first thing noticeable was the overwhelming aroma that floods your senses. The fresh smell of baked goods was so pleasing and a great indicator to what I was about to consume. 

I wanted sweets so went straight for the raspberry Danish, an apple turnover, two rocky road brownies, a cinnamon roll and two muffin tops. Had a taste of everything and they were superb! My favorite was the rocky road brownies and muffin tops. Definitely fulfilled my sweet tooth :)

It is worth mentioning that more than half of the huge store was making fresh bread such as loafs, rolls etc. If I were in the market for some I'm sure those would have been great as well. It sure smelled fantastic! 

Would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Great buns before the fire was mediocre at best, now fast forward post fire and it is turning out some of the best bread in town, the day old section is better than most markets fresh stuff, and only $1. 50 a bag. you cannot be in a hurry here, the staff is still working at pre-fire pace, when the place was not so busy. 
Put up with the seniors running the register and fill your  white paper bag up with fresh crunchy delicious Bread. 
Not a pastry shop. 
Everything bagel..."}
{"text":"If you go there try the bavarian cupcake its the best and their garlic bread is good too."}
{"text":"Recently Julie displayed customer service skills over and above what one would normally expect,in assisting me with my apple strudel purchase late in the day. Possibly new and improved recipe with more apple filling. Yummy. Returned a few days later for artisanal bread and bagels especially requested by a family member. Did not disappoint. All delicious. Staff very fast and friendly despite large volume of customers. Great variety and reasonable prices. Have been a customer for 10 years."}
{"text":"The white chocolate raspberry bread/loaf is AMAZING!! I made a grilled cheese with it (yeah you heard me right, a grilled cheese,) and it was beyond phenomenal, angels sang, the clouds parted, doves flew so forth and so on. I would give Great Buns 5 stars just because that bread was sooo good, but unfortunately the dinner rolls (I bought white chocolate and olive,) were a bit on the dry and bland side. I went right before closing so maybe I'll give them another chance when they're fresh. I was told they bake twice a day so bread is fresh at 7am and 4pm. The other reason they don't get the extra star: they told me someone was held up by a crazy with a knife in front of the store last week (um, what?!!) I don't like to fear for my life when I pick up baked goods, but maybe that's just me."}
{"text":"I have lived in Vegas for 5 years and passed this bakery a thousand times. Decided this morning to stop. Well being from NY I found my place. They have cannolis, (I have been ha ing them sent from home.) And the bread is amazing. Cupcake, black and white cookies. Bagels and real Kaiser rolls. I have my trip for Friday already planned out."}
{"text":"I use to get my bread here very unprofessional many times they didn't delivery my order when I called to ask an estimate time for delivery they would said driver is out there he should be there soon . He never made it till 3 days later .very unreliable . Now that I see this I'm glad that I switch to BOND BREAD . Their bread it's way better"}
{"text":"The bread and savory desserts are delicious.....you can't go wrong. The smell of baked bread is like an orgasmic smell....I love there Artisan olive bread sooooo good. Nice and soft in the middle and a nice crispy layer from the outside. The reason I am giving a four star is I wish they had some gluten free breads. I don't recall seeing any but it would be nice if they have some the next time I go.

Also it's not a large bakery! So don't expect crazy pastries. The pastries they do have are your basic tarts, Danishes and strudels and a few other cakes and cookies."}
{"text":"This place is a carb lover's dream come true! I don't get here often but it is so worth it. When I came in, they were out of butter croissants. I waited as I was told more would be on the way. As soon as they dropped the tray, I was all over it. I got a box and filled it up. Nothing beats fresh bread. I devoured it in the car while still in GB's parking lot. Yes, that was me stuffing my face. The rich, buttery, layers of this fresh croissant is worth the hour on the treadmill. 

I have purchased other breads here as they are so fresh and affordable but the croissant is what keeps me coming back. 

My bf loves their coconut macaroons. They are pretty tasty. Crispy on the outside, just the way I like it. They also have chocolate dipped macaroons too. 

Love this place!"}
{"text":"I was here cause I was curious..ending up buying a box of pastries.

Breads are fresh and delicious.

A must place to visit.

Service was Good and friendly."}
{"text":"UPDATE 3/21/07: Great Buns was destroyed by fire last night -- http://www.KVBC.com/Global/story.asp?s=6258469

---------

Hidden in the back of a little industrial park, the amusingly named Great Buns Bakery specializes in fresh-baked breads. 

I should warn you that there's nothing artisanal about this place; it's a large-scale operation, with all the baking done on site in a thoroughly charm-free industrial bakery. One of the employees told us that they supply bread to \"90% of the restaurants\" in the area, and there certainly were dozens of pallets of rolls and loaves stacked up right on the retail floor, tagged with the names of local shops and eateries. 

But 'big' doesn't necessarily mean 'bad': The breads I've tried all taste great -- the ciabatta in particular - and the prices are competitive. We picked up a loaf of day-old bread for $0.99 today, and it tasted just fine. 

I'll just ignore the fact that all the staff wear aprons that say \"Keep your hands off my Great Buns\"."}
{"text":"Everything is so yummy here!!! Be warned, if you walk in and smell the amazingness, you will want to buy one of everything. The bundt cakes are my favorite and they are so reasonably priced. Great bakery!"}
{"text":"my experience at Great buns Bakery was absolutely astounding. I would like to recognize the staff and Liz the supervisor for being so accommodating. Liz pulled samples of bread for me give me price sheets and make sure that I have the names of every bun that I grabbed correct. Thank you great buns Bakery!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love the cinnamon danish.  We special order so we can get a little less icing.  Staff is very helpful."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Accidentally spent way more than I wanted to.  Fair pricing.  Am going to be a regular customer."}
{"text":"They have no idea of what sourdough bread is.  Yesterday I bought what I thought was sourdough.  It was no different than plain old wonder bread.  My wife and I lived in San Francisco for 45 years and know good sourdough.  I have learned to accept lesser quality away from the Bay Area.  I took it back, thinking they package the wrong bread, however, the manager I talked with said in her opinion it was sourdough. I was shocked that she would say that and  I fear that this company has no idea of what they are selling because the bread I bought didn't have the taste, texture or smell of sourdough. She offered to replace it.  Why?  I would have been the same.  Very sad."}
{"text":"For all u  Chicago people  looking for a roll that will stand up to the \"wet\" test look no further. Steak roll (yes not Vienna) thumps up."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love baked goodies? This is definitely the place to go for that! Stopped by here 2 weeks ago on a Thursday with my husband. As soon as I came in, I could IMMEDIATELY smell that fresh baked bread with undertones of sweet cinnamon in between. If I could, I would really buy everything (and I mean EVERYTHING) in this store. Everything looked and smelled so good. My first thought upon entering in here was I wished there was a place like this near my home. 

I ended up purchasing a jumbo cinnamon roll (this cinnamon roll was pretty big), a croissant, cinnamon stick that had a taste like a churro, a few raspberry filled pastries and a small shortbread cookie. Everything was really good, even the next day. I was surprised to find that some of our baked treats were not stale the next day. 

Everything here is so cheaply priced and would love to stop by here again if I am ever in town. Oh and by the way, there is a $5 minimum for credit card transactions."}
{"text":"Great buns bakery has a large variety of baked goods, everything that I have indulged my pallet has been delicious, I haven't had anything that I didn't like. I drive 35 minutes to come and buy my bread and pastry's it is so worth it, I recommend great buns bakery if your looking for quality, freshness, good customer service and last but no least deliciousness."}
{"text":"I can't say enough great things you will find here.......if you time it right, warm from the oven. Apple horns that taste like fall, croissants that melt in your mouth, fresh cannoli and even homemade chocolate cupcakes with crime filling! A must do for the holidays. And, they still make fresh hot cross buns for Easter .  Love the staff, the ladies are great, answering questions or slicing a loaf of fresh baked bread for you. Definitely a 10 out of 10 for me!"}
{"text":"Can't believe I had never been here before! Talk about a hidden bread gem in Las Vegas! All types of fresh baked goodies and at great prices! From cinnamon rolls to pretzel rolls, pretty much everything you can think of. They also have a day old bread section with discounted prices. Best of all, Black and White cookies are only .95!"}
{"text":"Mediocre mass produced and flavorless. The quality lacks. But the variety had potential from dinner rolls to muffins to baguettes they're all here.
I got muffins and a mini bundt cake. The muffins didn't taste fresh--I might as well have bought it pre-packaged at the grocery. The bundt cake was horribly dry.
No can do."}
{"text":"Boring, ordinary, mass-produced breads and baked goods. Typicial American supermarket fare. In fact, they are a production bakery.

What's actually sad, is too see how many people give this place a high rating. Very little in the way of QUALITY bakeries in Las Vegas, thus when presented with few choices, they do seem ok."}
{"text":"The place smells wonderful.  The selection runs to mostly white flour breads and a few sweet items.  The bagels are decent--not water bagels, but there doesn't seem to be anywhere in Vegas that makes REAL bagels."}
{"text":"Finally I found a bakery which makes real, tasty breads! They have some pastries which are also good. They have a huge selection, so I just keep coming back to try a new stuff. Nothing has disappointed me yet. I particularly liked almond croissant.

They have a weekly special, but sell a day old bread for $1.69, which is really a steal.  

They accept credit card if your purchase is $5 or more."}
{"text":"The only reason I came here was because of the name. Just seeing the logo of a giant baker's butt on the building was enough for me! But upon entering, the smell of baking bread and the sight of a functional baking factory behind the product bins was pretty awesome.

Products span several varieties of breads, shaped in rounds, rolls, sticks, and every other conceivable figure, offered at great prices... along with several sweets, bagels, loaves, and cookies. Don't forget to snag a brownie sample by the register, and check out the dirt-cheap day-old selection by the windows. 

The sourdough bread bowls here are great for winter soups (available in large and mini sizes), and can be pre-ordered if needed. The macarons are large and moist, and the best my BF has had. I can't get enough of their everything bagels, getting a day-old 6-pack for $1.65 is almost as good as receiving flowers!"}
{"text":"Came here today for the first time. Wow!!! Why haven't I discovered this place before. Sooooo good. Amazing selection. So fresh, friendly staff, and the prices and so reasonable."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time the other day after finding it on Yelp.  So many delightful options to choose from as I walked around the store.  Finally decided and bought the HUGE Apple Strudel, a couple of Chocolate Croissants, Apple Danish and a couple of mini Caramel Apple pastries.  Everything we tried was delicious and the pastries were so light and flaky.  Will definitely return when I'm back in town next month."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Its an accidental find. We looked around for bagel places that were open at 7 and this was one of them and we headed there, only to find that this was a wholesale  bakery factory that's also open to public. For bread lovers this is bread heaven. Plenty to choose from, delicious, appetising array of breads, bakes, bagels, danishes, croissants etc etc...I it's a long list. You will not be able to stop yourself from grabbing a tray or 2 or 3 or 4 trays full of baked good... Heaven!

Only be aware its not a typical bagel place, where they might toast and smear your bagel, but they sure do have great BUNS!

The staff is the most adorable team, as sweet as their baked goodies...

Will definitely visit again"}
{"text":"Thanks a lot.  Great Buns has basically ruined me.  The pastries I have tried so far have all been wonderfully flaky and delicious.  The breads and rolls... I am in love.  and so many different choices.  All of them wonderfully crusty, soft and delicious.

Awesome, just awesome. Did I even mention the prices?  My goodness, there is still such a thing as getting your moneys worth!  This bakery is the best thing I have come across in a while here in Vegas.  Even if I don't need bread.  If I happen to be driving by and they are open.  You will find me in there!"}
{"text":"After my husband heard about the great yum-yums and $$ at Great Buns, he perused their website and texted me about 7 different things he wanted to try.  Ha! Ha!

We narrowed it down to two:  pineapple upside down cake and the cherry crumb cake and I picked them up on Friday, December 7th.

The pineapple upside down cake was, I hear, a HIT at my sister's house last night (my super sweet man brought me home a piece which I'm preparing to taste after my tea is ready).  What I can tell you right now, is that it is dense, looks amazing, and unbelievably priced at $11.00 (I rounded up a few cents).

The cherry crumb cake was wonderful!  It's amazing the difference you can taste in fresh pastries.  What I love about Great Buns is their pastries aren't too sweet, and they were very generous with the cherries in this crumb cake.

I also picked up some rolls for hamburgers.  Again, I love the difference you taste when you're easting fresh bread.  The rolls were fresh, large, soft but not mushy, and a good deal at $2.49 for a dozen especially considering the quality.

Isn't it great we have so many scrumptious bakeries to enjoy?"}
{"text":"Fresh breads and pastries daily at fantastic prices.  I also peek at the day olds whenever I can.  Their breads always have the correct textures and that lovely yeasty smell."}
{"text":"Life doesn't get any better then walking into Great Bund taking a deep breath and enjoying some amazing pastries. Love your buns."}
{"text":"Only if all places were actually great, like their name states. This place I found is great. 

You walk in and immediately know by the aroma they are baking everything fresh. They seem to have every type of bread imaginable, from classic French bread to bagels to artisan raisin Rye bread. For pastries, they had Bundt cakes, cookies, muffins, cupcakes, and much more.

I went and grabbed a couple bagels, and after eyeing the pastries, I purchased the Black & White Cookie, chocolate Bavarian cupcake with white chocolate, and a banana Bundt cake.

My grand total - less than $6.00. Sweet!

The employees were pretty busy but very friendly, even when I asked pestering questions about what's popular in their store. There were a good number of customers buying enormous amounts of bread. I guess things sell out. Not hard to believe.

The bagels I tried were cinnamon raisin & sesame, and they were soft and delicious. I wanted to love the pastries just as much, but I didn't care for them, sadly. Very sweet frostings with not-so-good batter. Weird after-taste after a bite of the Bundt cake. :( 

I thought my experience at first gave Great Buns more than 5 stars easy. Even though I was disappointed by the pastries, I believe maybe the other items were fully capable of being delicious, just as the bagels were. 

I'll definitely be going back, hopefully giving an updated rating of 5 stars the next time!"}
{"text":"Fun to shop! Great variety of buns & bread, nice attentive staffs, wide beautiful space of retail-front right next to the baking kitchen.  I like cheese danish!  Unfortunately, eclair was not my taste. I would like to try Barbarian cream croisant next time."}
{"text":"This is not your gourmet bakery, but more your bread store bakery with lots of varieties.  I drove past this for years and never stopped.  Didn't realize what exactly it was.  For me, the main thing is lots and lots of rolls and bread and you don't have to buy by the quantity at the store.  You fill your own bag with whatever you want.  They also had a very nicely priced item of the week.  Mainly I liked the buns (hoagie, sesame, etc) and I also got a bag of the dinner basket bread steakhouses have.  It seems to me this is what they do....make the bread for restaurants, but let the public come in to buy them.  I bought those raisin/nut rolls and they were awesome.  As well as the onion rolls.  They have these thumbprint cookies 4/$1 by the register and they are pretty darn tasty.  I tried a bagel and they were okay.  Good, not great.  I am still looking for a great bagel here.  Some of their \"gourmet\" items were under par.  For me, the goodness was in having the staples at a good price and getting a variety or the quantity you wanted.  I am still trying different things, but glad I finally went in this place.  

I love a good cinnamon roll, but they looked dry and bland.  I didn't get one because they didn't look good.  Not sure why others are saying they were divine."}
{"text":"Great buns and a bakery place. I love walking in and the smell of fresh baked breads just surrounds you. They have all kinds of breads, loaves or rolls, big or small, long or short. There are also pastries, cookies, other sweets. I got some bread sticks, cupcakes and cookies. They were all at a good price. This place supplies a lot of the surrounding casinos and restaurants."}
{"text":"Great buns bakery reminds me of the scene in waynes world where Wayne takes Garth to the back room at the donut shop and opens it to a room full of secret agents combat training each other . Iow it's like you walk expecting a shitty bakery shop but tbh it's a beautiful experience"}
{"text":"This is a great bakery. I have lived in the area for 15 years.  I am thankful I did not find the place earlier, I would be enormous.  The cheese danishes and raspberry tarts are the best I have ever had.  The bread is just as good as the pastry.  The prices are what make them unique. Inexpensive compared to other bakeries and I have not found anything that I did not like."}
{"text":"If you are a bread lover, you will be in heaven from the moment you walk into Great Buns.  The smell of fresh baked breads embraces you like a warm sweater or snuggie, or an old friend - when I go, usually I stop just inside the door and inhale deeply, as I do with my roses as they bloom.  Then it's time to shop!  Great Buns is a commercial bakery - they supply many of the restaurants and casino F&B operations in town - with a retail outlet for you, and what an outlet it is.  Whether it's sliced loaves of sandwich bread (whatever you like; sourdough, marble rye, multigrain, etc.) ... or dinner rolls (regular, wheat, raisin, cheddar, etc.) ... or sandwich rolls (too many to name) ... big loaves of kalamata olive or raisin bread, foccaccias, and PASTRIES.  Strudels, danishes, you name it.  I haven't tried their fresh pastas, but they do make pasta on site as well.  Everything is very reasonable - they also have a day-old rack if you are on a budget - no more than chain-grocery prices, for a much fresher and tastier product.  Everything is delicious.  Staff is cheerful and will take good care of you.  If you live in Las Vegas, this is THE place to buy your baked goods!"}
{"text":"This have been on my radar for quite some time now and I finally made it down here! 

A classic to Las Vegas and I can see why. The prices are great and the Almond ring thing is OMG bomb! 

If you have been here you must. A huge family operated bread bakery wholesale open to the public. 

The Great Bun Bakery have been serving Vegas since 1982. The store front is super convenient and the goodies are yummy. My favorite is the Almond ring and the Black and White cookies. The Toasted Almond are crunchy and the soft buttery flaky crossing bread thing is perfection and to top it off the drizzle of the sweet frosting brings it all together!!!! The lightly sweeten frosting is paired perfectly with the soft sugar cookie that is not too sweet and not too bland. Yum factor 5stars. The eclair is pretty dang good as the Cannoli. Also like I said price is on point and service is great! 

They get 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for baked goods, and especially so at sale time. If you do mind jostling around with the diehards, that is. Generally, this place is a low key, casual event. But when the sale goes down, all bets are off. But with so much to offer, it is hard to leave empty-handed.

I'd say that everything here is well done. There's really no weaknesses. It may not be as fancy as some places, but it has ample selections of hardy, old fashioned baked breads that are top notch. Someone here loves almonds and any item with them is going to be better than average.

The parking lot is kind of tricky, but navigatible. Get here early for the best choices. Simple, solid, classy Bakery."}
{"text":"Ran into this place on a whim and a suggestion by a friend. I came by really itching for a sweet pastry to get me thinking in the morning and was completely taken by surprise here. I imagined a mom and pop shop with a name as cute as \"great buns\"  but actually found a full industrial bakery inside. There is so much bread in there, I couldn't wrap my mind around it. 

Forced to make some choices, I picked out a berry danish, flat bread with jalapeno cheese, pound cake, and a blueberry muffin. Best danish I have ever bitten into! Crisp on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside. The berry filling was not overly sweet or overwhelming, just right. The muffin could have used some more berries though, but the actual muffin cake was also sweet and fluffy.

All of this for less than nine bucks! I couldn't believe it - that only gets you a drink and a slice of pastry at Starbucks. This is the only place I'll go for bread products from now on."}
{"text":"Bread, cookies, pastry, cakes and pies. We've tried very nearly everything at Great Buns and it's all good! The service/atmosphere is fun... Like a old world market in Europe. I just can't say enough about how good everything is but the crazy part... The prices are very reasonable. If you've ever enjoyed top quality baked goods in one of the many high end Vegas restaurants, there is a very good chance you've eaten a Great Buns product... They obviously serve a very long list of wholesale customers. You'd think that a massive operation like Great Buns would be relatively cold to individual retail customer suggestions but that is not the case... They are warm and engaging. I would go here even as a tourist staying on the Strip... You will not get out the door without a load of great stuff!"}
{"text":"This place is like a crack haven for sweet-toothed folks like me.  Wow.  While the ambience is lacking in cutesy charm, like many a cupcake shop or cafe, the selection and value are off the hook.  Yesterday, I chose a black-and-white cookie, the Bavarian cream cupcake, a mini marble pound cake, and a ginormous cinnamon roll.  That all came to just over $5.  Crazy!  Everything was really good and everything was devoured within about an hour.  

The process for selecting your sweet somethings is easy: walk in, inhale, grab a plastic bag and grab whatever strikes your fancy.  Walk over to the cashier and pay for your goodies.  Eat and enjoy.  Repeat as necessary.

I WILL be back to try the artisan bread!"}
{"text":"Great buns is my favorite place ever for everything bread related. I've been a customer for about 8 yrs and I've never been let down. The white chocolate raspberry bread is divine! Try the health nut cookies, they are packed with nuts. Everything is quality stuff. All the almond rolls are totally wonderful as r the other raspberry, lemon etc tarts. Just go there and see for yourself. U will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I get fat just going here. This place is fantastic. The smell of fresh bread is my kryptonite, but I will note that, they do large scale production, which I think has diminished some of the nuances that make homemade bread/pastries, etc magical versus just delicious. However, that being said, I love their buns. They are the best non-homemade Sammy/hamburger buns out there. I also am known to demolish a mini loaf or two of the white chocolate bread. - Side note, if you have willpower to not eat the entire loaf, it makes excellent French toast. As to the pastries, they are ok. I would give them 3 stars. But I go here for bread, so this place is great for me!"}
{"text":"So I went in to get a sandwich because their Yelp description says they make sandwiches, which they do not.  I was rather disappointed, as I made a special trip to try this place because of that, but moving on.  I bought a loaf of french bread, a loaf of sourdough, a bag of day old rolls and some pastries.  The croissant filled with cream was very good.  I haven't tried anything else yet.  Their prices are good, as is their selection of breads and rolls."}
{"text":"HUGE building and a plethora of fresh baked goods for sale. I had seen Great Buns Bakery trucks driving around Las Vegas for years but never stopped in. Today was the day, the wife and I wanted to get some pre Mother's Day goodies for a surprise.

I was surprised at how large the building was, more like a warehouse. The inside had plenty of bins with all types of breads, cookies and various baked desserts. The staff were busy boxing up orders for customers as we perused the selections. We arrived at 3:45pm and they close at 5:00pm. We saw them putting signs up for discounts on items but they were not available until after 4:00. 

The aroma in the bakery smelled of fresh baked bread and they had many loads to choose from. Today we got a couple chocolate Bavarian cream filled cup cakes, a red velvet cream cheese topped cup cake, some macaroons, a couple soft fresh cinnamon rolls and a couple eclairs. I had to sneak a macaroon on the way to visit Mum...delicious coconut with he right consistency.

We will be back again to get some fresh breads and give them a try."}
{"text":"I work for PBS and when we have our pledge drives, Great Buns brings the volunteers goodies.  Well, sometimes the volunteers don't eat all their goodies (what.  the.  eff.  what's the point in volunteering then?  feeling good?  BAH!) and guess who gets the leavin's?  That's right!  Little ol' me!

Their stuff is always great.  I mean, it beats the Costco cupcakes the IT guy brings in (not that I DON'T eat those....).  They don't compare to Freed's, but really what does?  

I had a cupcake today that was chocolaty and moist and really helped with the whole PMS thing.  The coconut glob in the middle, however, was pretty grosstastic but I HATE coconut.  I've had croissants from them among other random bread products and everything's always flavorful, fresh and well textured.

And usually there's no random roaming coconut."}
{"text":"Very clean place and has a ton of different options to get. The first time I was there I got gnocchi and pound cake. The lady I talked to must have been new because she told me to bake them in the oven? Yeah...no. The next time I went I asked the lady (different) one and she said that you boil them,which was what I assumed. Very nice helpful staff. And tasty food!"}
{"text":"Finally made it to Great Buns.  It has been on my bakeries to try list for awhile.  I got a cheese danish, cinnamon roll and cannoli.  Everything was good.  Cinnamon roll being my favorite.  Jamie W is right about the cheese danish, sooo much cheese.    It was hard to eat it was so messy.  I liked it though.  Prices are super cheap and the ladies working the register were friendly.  Looking forward to going back and trying some of their bread and other items."}
{"text":"We've been Great Buns customers for a few years. Everything we've tried has been excellent. Their prices are reasonable. The staff is very friendly. 

The rye bread is the best, the apple coffee cake is delicious, apple strudel out of this world, brownies, turnovers, white chocolate dinner rolls, French bread, etc etc etc,

They also fill special orders such as kummelweck rolls, a special sandwich roll, I believe is native to Buffalo NY, for our Sunday football games."}
{"text":"I love this bakery.  I've been their costumer for almost a year now buying verity of stuff from them and never got disappointed.     They have really good prices and service and I just love going there.  
This place is awesome."}
{"text":"I discover this place about a year ago from a friend.. I love coming here to buy breads.  They have a wide varieties of different breads and sweets.
It's so cheap for a dozen dinner rolls or mini hoagies.. Only $2.49.. You can't beat that!! Not only is it cheap, it's also tasty and buttery..
Their desserts are just alright, too sweet for my taste and not my type of bake good.

A lot of restaurants, small shops and casino order from them.. So if you need hamburger buns like at those fancy joint then come here and buy it.. Super market buns are NOT the same!!

I wish they have another location in the southwest area, cuz this is just too far.."}
{"text":"Hot buns, Big buns, Small buns, Round buns, Thin buns, Crusty buns, Soft buns, Sticky Buns, but no Old buns at Great Buns!    I want to squeeze some buns in a bad way when I come here.    Hell, I want to put my face in a few buns and shake like a Magic Johnson's bobble head doll, and bite them in the sweet spot!    Okay, I'm not going to destroy a Apple pie like Jim in the first American pie movie, but  this place is really that good.

Great buns was so hot that it burnt down in 2007, and thankfully so because if it didn't, I would have not known about it.    By the grace of god, the bad news on channel 8, turned me into a new customer when it reopened.    It's a like a marriage coming to this place, you love doing the nasty, but hate working on the small details; So in other words, it's like eating a Bavarian ding dong and then working out for a couple of hours on the treadmill to burn it off.   

Great buns isn't your usual stand alone bakery, because you're self serving the majority of items, but like what Chris Tucker said in Rush Hour 2, \" you don't jump in front of black man in a buffet line\"   (it stand true for me even thought I'm not soul brother number #1)...because some damn old lady snake the last Apple danish ($1.29) from me when I got there.   I should have put the smack down on her, and sang The Rock's WWE rendition of \" You look beautiful tonight\" while  taking it from her, but I'm a gentleman, and even opened the front door for her.   If I didn't open the door, that danish would have been MINE!     But then a ray of light shined down on me,  and another customer decided that they didn't need another Apple Strudel ($4.59)....SO I GRAB IT like quicksilver.    When I got it home, it was gone in 60 seconds!    It was buttery and flaky, and tasted like a Zippy apple napple! 

Then the next plan of attack was the white chocolate raspberry bread ($3.59), and a few ding dongs.   Those items are behind counter, and this bread made a great french toast.    The ding dongs ($1.39)  are King Kong sized compared to the  hostess type, and need to be kept cold because of the Bavarian cream....what the hell, the temperature currently in Las Vegas doesn't feel like hell at the moment, and getting them home is like stealing candy from a baby.

It seem this place has some kind of happy hour after 4:00 pm, and a good number of item are cut half off by that time.    I never quite make it here during that  time of the day, because most of the pastries are MIA or KIA in someone stomach by that time.   Most of their products are so sinfully good, that majority of them are naughtier than the crowd at Hard Rock's Rehab.  

Why a four star?   because if I don't make it there in time....it's gone till the next day.   Finally, for that Grandma who snake the danish from me.   I hope you broke your dentures on it, because I'm craving that darn thing right now like how Woody Harrison was craving Twinkies in Zombieland."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this bakery 
The best pizza dough and the best pastries. Employees are very friendly."}
{"text":"Had some great tasting sourdough toast at a restaurant and the waitress said they get their bread at Great Buns.  Went here to get sourdough loaves to take back to CA.  The bread was so fresh it was hard to slice.  It was easier to slice the next day.  BTW, the bakery offered to slice the bread.  Will get it sliced next time."}
{"text":"I believe this is one of the best bakery's in town! Every time I go there the staff is so helpful and nice. The baked goods from breads to pastry's are fresh and absolutely delicious! The quality & the prices are outrageously great! I have never been disappointed with a purchase at Great Buns!"}
{"text":"Just moved to Vegas and always looking for a bakery...this is an amazing bakery...they have everything...I'm a huge pumpernickel bread fan and the one from here was to die for...also got for the family an almond croissant, apple turnover, cinnamon roll, copycat of a Hostess cupcake, and a chocolate bunt cake...everything was AMAZING...a total must try"}
{"text":"Best bakery ever! We are new to the neighborhood and discovered this hidden gem! I won't buy bread or cakes anywhere else! Everything we have purchased has been great!"}
{"text":"Love the bread! Been coming here since I was a child. The breads here they make are good and always fresh! Also its cheap to buy then markets. When you just want to buy one dozen of bread, next thing you do is buying two more dozens. Great staffs."}
{"text":"They have the best bread, pastries in town. Fresh Bread daily. Price reasonable and friendly cashiers/assistants."}
{"text":"Despite the fact that they're always out of the things I love (I'm looking at you, mini guava pastries and chocolate croissants), I keep coming back. They make the neighborhood smell like baking bread, which is just mean on Sundays when their store is closed. Their specialty breads are delish. The cream cheese Danish and almond croissants are cravable, and there's always something new I want to try. Get your elbows up- the oldsters around here will fight you for the last raisin rye loaf, or trick you into believing you messed up some fake system so that you feel obligated to give them your goods, and then they'll cut in line."}
{"text":"More grazers here than at Costco. And that drives me crazy because I am about to pay for the same type of item that the guy next to me just just shoved into his mouth. It also drives me crazy because I am a tattle tale, so, yeah, me and Yelp found each other and are perfectly matched. I observe and report and Yelp tells the world.
Aside from that little tidbit, I love Great Buns. I am sure you do too. 
Great Buns has a great selection of freshly baked breads and pastries that are delicious and not hard on the pocketbook. As you walk in, head over to the right side and check out the day old items; they are just as good and you might save a few bucks. I also use the day old area to try new items and pick up breads to make french toast, bread pudding or stuffing.
The ladies that work the counter are usually friendly and the shop is usually clean. Sometimes there is a fly buzzing around, but my Dad says they don't eat much, so just share :)

Great Buns is closed on Sundays.

Tip: Try the cranberry/ white chocolate rolls, they are really good!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for over 10 years and it never fails ! Best bakery in las vegas hands down"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!  I asked a restaurant where they got their bread because it was so good, \"Great Buns\" 

 I walked in and it smelled so good, fresh baked bread..awwww  The prices were just amazing.  I got 12 hamburger buns for $2.39!  GOOD buns not the crappy ones you get at the store....and 12 not 8!  So I picked up a cinnamon roll, almond filled croissant, a red velvet cup cake, 2 chocolate filled cup cakes, 2 doz hamburger buns, 1 doz hot buns, a round loaf of sour dough bread and a cranberry walnut loaf. I only spent $20!  I could have taken home the whole store.  My husband ate his chocolate cupcake, he is picky and said it was really gooood.  I had the cinnamon roll it was so yummy.  I am so going back.  Oh and they had cakes and cookies too...."}
{"text":"I've been going to this bakery since I was a little girl.  If I ever have to pick up any kind of baked good this is the only place I go.  Sadly I can no longer eat bread but when I need it for the family, parties and gifts I go here and have been for over 20 years!"}
{"text":"Great Buns is more of a bread bakery with some other options such as pies, Bundt cakes, strudel, turnovers apple and cherry coffee cake. Today they also had cannoli. They carry a large variety of breads and rolls.
The heavenly aroma of fresh bread will hit you the minute you walk in.
Today, day before Thanksgiving, was a very busy day with many customers inside when I arrived. They were adequately staffed and the employees were pleasant."}
{"text":"I like Great Buns and I cannot lie. 

I don't have great buns. If I eat here too much I might have great big buns though. A girl can dream, right?

Back to the bakery. Great Buns is really great. 
Great prices: 
$1.65 for pastries the size of the Sun
$.60 bagels 
$.95 Black and White cookies. These are my favorite because surprisingly they are a normal size unlike most deli ones and quite tasty, too. 

Great flavor. Everything is homemade and you can taste it. Am I a huge fan of the cheese danish? No. The pastry part tastes like pure butter if that's your thing. Also the Loch Ness Monster could be swimming in the tasty cheese part because there's just so damn much of it. You need floaties just to make your way through it. Every other item I've tried I love. Especially the coffee cakes. You cannot beat their taste and value. Perfect to bribe coworkers with or sabotage their fight to fit in that bikini. 

Great Service- I am not going to say they are great, but hey, they give me my sweets at a killer price. That's enough service for me. 

Only reason this isn't a five star for me is because of the Everything Bagel. Here is why. The bagel doesn't seem to have that strong salt flavor or garlic kick. It has tons of toppings, just not the ones that make Everything my drug of choice. Do I still get one every single time I'm here? What do you think? Also, they do not have cream cheese for sale. Annoying. FYI. This is a grab and go bakery. No seats.

I hope I still sold this bakery to you because it is worth a visit or 500. Don't act like you don't like some Great Buns."}
{"text":"This place is really a great hidden gem. We drove up expecting a small local bakery with a dine in section but we were surprised to find a large-scale operation with lots to offer. I was almost overwhelmed with all the choices because there were so many options: loaf bread, dinner rolls, soft pretzels, buns, muffins, danishes, bundt cakes, pound cakes, and much more. Just to be clear: this is a walk-in, buy-your-stuff, walk-out (no frills) kind of place. We bought a huge loaf of sliced sour dough, a still warm cheese danish (to die for), and a mini pound cake--all for roughly $7 and some change. Everything is really affordable and (from what I've tried so far) very yummy. This isn't like some \"fancy\" bakeries where the food looks gorgeous but rarely tastes very good... The cheese danish I had wasn't the prettiest pastry I ever tried, but it may have been the best tasting. Give this place a try and your inner carb lover will thank you!"}
{"text":"I stopped by based on the great reviews. Unfortunately I was kinda disappointed because of my expectations on the pastries..

On the plus side, I enjoyed these little artisan cheese rolls. They kinda tasted like cheese bagels, which I like. They seemed to have a great selection of different breads.. I almost bought the marble rye sliced bread but I didn't get it....

I also thought the large Apple pastries looked good, and I did get one and it was probably the best out of all of the things I purchased. It had a criss-crossed lattice layer on top, and a good amount of apple filling, and it was a very large size, and it was about $5. There was something called an Apple Horn that was $8 that looked good also.

On the negative side, the almond croissant was like.. not flaky or buttery at all like a real croissant. I would suggest Jean Philippe at Aria/Bellagio for a good parisian almond croissant.  These pastries kinda seem like the kind you would buy pre-packaged in a supermarket, the ones that have preservatives in them too..."}
{"text":"I could go crazy in this place. It's cheap and there's so much to choose from. There's Danishes, pastries, cupcakes, breads, pastas in the freezer etc. I didn't get to try the bread yet, but I had tried a banana cake and black and white cookie. Both of which were yummy. Did I mention the great prices? I do plan to go back to buy some fresh baked bread to try next time."}
{"text":"I have come to this bakery frequently...it is good.  They have muffins that are very moist, probably one of my favorite things here.  Danishes are also good...and bread for your sandwiches.  I come here most mornings.  Some mornings the ladies who are working are very busy, but they are nice.  I love that you can grab most of the breads yourself as well.  Smells great too.  The prices are also a plus.  I think supporting local is great."}
{"text":"I'm from Germany and always on the hunt for my artisan bread/rolls.  Been at Great Bums today the 1st time and got poppy seed rolls, Kaiser rolls, and little baguettes rolls that were all  good and crunchy. The Prezel stuff is just not like home, it's not crunchy enough. I have to Reheat them in the oven, maybe they will be good then. Almond croissant was really good. I buy only artisan/German stuff, cause that's the only stuff I like, not so much up for bagels. 
I would have given 5 stars, if the cashier would not had spit in my bag of rolls and I had to get other ones. It was the black girl, chewing a gum and trying to sell me more stuff while this was the 1st time and we just wanted to try and see how it is. As soon she starts talking, her spitt went right in my bag with the rolls. I got me fresh ones, but she said she didn't spitt and that to another customer. Woman take the gum out and don't talk over customers food. I know what I see!"}

This place smells amazing!!!! If you've never been here.. you need to get your buns over here! They have amazing prices for great bread and pastries."}
{"text":"Product here is great. Always is. They lose three stars for their employees. Some are great, some need to work on their people skills. We use them for our restaurant. We go in and get what we need as we need it. We don't need to be yelled at by some ticked off employee because we are BUYING what we need. Are their products just there for display? No. They say they need them for 'regular customers'. What are we then? If they don't sell the buns, they get put on the 'day old' rack where they are sold on the cheap. If one of my employees yelled at a customer for buying too many pizzas, they would be fired. We have been confronted numerous times for BUYING a lot of bread. The people that yell at us aren't even the ones who have to bake more, so it's no extra work for them. Some of the good employees have even told us to ignore them, buy what and as much as we want. We have gone in there sometimes and they have been out of what we need. We don't complain that they don't have what we need. We just go back the next day. First come, first serve, right?"}
{"text":"I have always been pleased with most of the products they offer here. From the bread to the pastry, all have been very good. 

Dinner rolls- I always get this when I'm here. They are best when toasted and they sort of continue to cook because they almost steam, kind of hard to explain what happens exactly. None the less,  a nice crunch forms outside and the inside is moist and soft. 

They use to sell mini ciabata, which were absolute divine. Unfortunately they only sell their normal size ciabata which aren't as good. They are actually sort of dry. Hopefully they bring them back some day 

In addition to the great products the costumer service here is great. They are always friendly at the cash register. Once I was in 2 minutes after they closed and the door was locked and allowed me to come in just as long as I knew what I was getting. I work in a retail store and we absolutely hate late comers."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this bakery for 30 years.  I can't say that one thing is good, because EVERYTHING is delicious.  The breads, the sweets, EVERYTHING.  If you have not been there you should go.  If you go hungry believe me you will come out with a lot of delicious items.  Reasonably priced as well."}
{"text":"I love the smell of freshly-baked bread.  I love specialty breads and cookies.  And I love good prices.  This place has all of the above.  From my experience, the best time to come is around 8 a.m. when they have the fullest variety of fresh items.  They also have the best assortment of day-old items- $1.69 for a bag of breadstuff.  I definitely need to start coming here more often :)"}
{"text":"I had always seen the signs for this place and said I need to go check it out.. I have had a hard time finding walnut raisin bread.. so I went here a little later in the day... I was first  shocked by how big the place was inside! And they carried the bread I wanted, but were sold out.. The associate told me that you have to come early in the morning to get that bread because they don't bake too many of them. I asked if I could put in an order to pick up because I couldn't get in very early the next morning. She said yes and took my order... the only reason I am holding back 5 stars was that it was very busy while I was there and only one person working behind the counter. I had a question about a cake and muffin. After close to 10 minutes I was finally approached and selected a cake. When I asked if the oat bran muffin had raisins in them the associate said \" I don't know, I've haven't had them before\" I got it anyways (because some of them did appear to have raisins). I picked up my bread today and it was very good!! Better than the place I previously got it.. the oat bran muffin did have raisins and was also very good.. I also did purchase a chocolate raspberry bunt cake that was as well very delicious... There is a lot of selection and the prices are very reasonable!! I will definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"I read the reviews and thought it would be a gem of a place to buy specialty bread products. They look well enough of if you can get by all the flies that were abuzz in there this morning. Decided I didn't want to take a chance eating these products.."}
{"text":"We usually love this place and had told so many friends about it but today was not a good experience.  I had brought a friend to the store with me today because they do a buy one get one half price late for pastries on Saturdays. When we arrived at 3:45 they told us and several other people in the store including 2 pregnant women and several elderly women that the half price deal would not be until 4:00. At 4 we got back in line and waited to place our order.  When we made it to the front they decided to change the time to 4:15.  One of the elderly ladies said they had originally told her 3:45.  We were so fed up with the constant changing of time that we just left.  If your going to give a time then you should honor it!! Not keep changing your mind.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Went here on my way to work today to mix it up a bit from the normal routine! Oh my any diet I planned on starting is now out the window! I have driven by this place for years and never stopped!
When I walked in the aroma was wonderful..I was kind of a deer in headlights since I had never been and everywhere I looked was bread, delicious bread!
They had a large wall of day old bread for 1.49$ a bag, I didn't look closely but I plan to on my next visit! They had bins of bagels and rolls and all kinds of other bread that you could by per piece or by the dozen. I think I even spied bread bowls which will be fab come winter! They had Danishes and cinnamon rolls that were seriously the size of a salad plate!
They require a minimum 5.00 purchase to debit and since I really was just planning on grabbing something for breakfast I had to alter my plan a bit..I got 5 Sesame Bagels, a mini chocolate swirl pound cake and a chocolate coconut muffin..for $5.60!
The only thing I have tried so far is the muffin, it is like a macaroon and a cake like brownie had a love child! At first I thought it was a tad dry but when I got to the center my opinion changed!
The bagels and loaf cake I have hidden in my office..I know it's sad I should probably share and I promise I did learn it in Kindergarten..but I am going to take them home to enjoy with my family tonight!
The woman who worked the counter was very pleasant and asked how I found out about them since I let her know it was my first time..I told her Yelp and I drive by often on my way to work! She said she had heard of Yelp
All in All..it was a great place and next time I plan to look around even more.."}
{"text":"The first thing I noticed when I walked in the store was that there was no great bread smell. I then got home with my haul and figured out why; nothing was good. We bought a french bread that had no flavor unless you consider cardboard as having a flavor; we threw it out. The almond croissant had no almond flavor; I simply do not know how a bakery can grind almonds and make a flavorless paste out of it! We bought a cinnamon roll and a sticky bun. The problem with the cinnamon roll was that the bread was doughy and the sticky bun bread was too hard. I cannot figure out why anybody would rate this place with anything but one star."}
{"text":"Everything from the breads, bagels, cakes, cannolis, rolls, pastries and especially the Italian cookies are wonderful!  the older ladies up front are so sweet and customer service oriented.  It's in a run down strip mall type area a hidden gem but there are people sometimes lined up at 7 am to get their goodies!  This is my go to place and I highly recommend it for everybody!"}
{"text":"My Mother in Law took me to Great Buns. It was so busy that day. I can see why. Their bread is really tasty and very reasonable. I brought home a bag of buns and my husband said they were the best he ever had. A couple of days ago he went on his own and he asked one of the girls what their farm bread was. She told him it had no sugar added to it and it was whole grain. He brought home a bag and it was so good that he and I are both spoiled now. We don't want to eat any other bread. You really should try their farm bread. It is really tasty. We even have it with our dinner. Put a little butter or margarine on it and it is just to die for! DELICIOUS! My Mother in law likes their bundt cakes. She bought half of  a raspberry one and half of a pineapple one. I am dieting but I have to tell you it took  A LOT of will power to turn it down. They look so good. We will definitely be going back to Great Buns. I highly recommend this place if you are looking for tasty bread and great bargains. Hope this review helps you. Mary"}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never been in here. It smells amazing! 
They have everything from bagels to desserts, sourdough bread bowls and different types of sandwich breads. 
I got a mini caramel apple turnover. It was delicious!
We also got a loaf of fresh sourdough sandwich bread.
They make everything right there in the store. 
Staff was friendly and helpful.
$5 minimum purchase to use a debit card."}
{"text":"You could smell the freshness of the buns before you walk in, sooo good! Friendly staff :)"}
{"text":"A locally-owned bakery, so you're starting out with 3 stars of course. 
They have a great selection there - everything from dinner rolls to bagels to donuts to sandwich bread to all sorts of pastries. The pastries range from full-size to individual, and are mostly delicious, from what I've tried. They always have a great selection, and are always churning out more from the back (this is a serious bakery, and they provide lots of breads to local restaurants).
I always get the pastries, so I can't comment too much on the regular breads, but I know pastry prices are really good. You can get mini-strudels for like 50 or 60 cents, or a big danish for about $1.50. 
You fix your own bag and then check out at the register, so it's pretty fast, but it does lack some of that charm you may get in a smaller place. 
They are running specials all the time, especially on weekends when they lower the price on whatever is left over.
Ambience is like that of an actual commercial bakery, which is cool, but don't expect to sit down on the patio and eat your pastries while sipping a latte...definitely more of a to-go place.
Overall, I love Great Buns: selection, prices, taste, service, and location. They are definitely my go-to for special occasion breads!"}
{"text":"The tasty enemy of the ever so popular Atkins diet and honestly i dont care! I think i workout enough to treat myself to the simple pleasure of this lovely concoction called BREAD! I use to be a regular at the location that was on West Sahara and then it closed down in place of Nothing Bundt Cakes which im not totally a fan of. I was sad to say the least given that i loved to get a fresh loaf at the beginning of the week to make my brown sack lunch for work during the week. Thank god for Yelp, and thanks to Rachel below for posting a recent review to where i noticed another location in Vegas, and i just came from there as i chomp on some sourdough as i type. The same fresh, soft, crusty, yummy bread! and how do you beat the deals on the $1.50 day old rack also (great place to get rolls for dinner party's by the way). They also have great bagels if you do the bring bagels to work thing, and what i use to use them for as well was the larger baked items like the almond rings, cakes or even the strudels for dinner party's or even office appreciation gifts for people to enjoy. I mean sure donuts, pizza, etc is ok but mix it up a bit and get something different once and a while. If you appreciate a good loaf of bread with dinner, or even croissant with your morning coffee you should definitely give Great Buns a look as it will not disappoint."}
{"text":"We were in the area to have breakfast. The smell caught my attention,  but with a name like that we had to go in.  They really do have great buns!! lol everything looked, smelled, and tasted so good."}
{"text":"Mini Guava pastries- Hell yeah!!!!!!!
They are so melt in your mouth yummers.....
TRUST ME - TRY ONE BEFORE YOU DIE!!!!!!

After that intro if you can believe it, I do like other goodies here.....
The white chocolate cranberry dinner rolls are delish!!!!
I love all the fresh bread here - good texture - perfect with a good slab of butter- Heaven!!!!
Oh, and I can't forget to mention the prices- so darn affordable - it's like $2.00 for a dozen rolls and like 80 cents for a Guava Pastry.
They also make good bundt cakes.
They used to do birthday cakes but I was told not anymore- they should make them again.
All in all Great Buns Bakery is a Great Bakery and I'm glad that they survived that fire a few years ago.
I can't wait to go get me some mini Guava Pastries......"}
{"text":"Great prices for quality food! I came here for butter croissants and was not disappointed ($0.89 each). The larger butter croissants are definitely better than the smaller ones. I also tried the almond and chocolate croissants, which didn't really impress me as much as the butter croissants. The almond croissant was too hard and not buttery, while the chocolate one was too sweet (I feel like they use chocolate frosting rather than chocolate for filling). My family also tried some muffins, which were pretty good. I recommend the chocolate muffin and the lemon poppyseed muffin. Also, we tried the sticky buns. They were delicious.

Overall, this place is amazing! I plan to come here again :)"}
{"text":"I discovered Great Buns Bakery about a year ago. It has been a challenge to  healthy eating, because the baked goods here absolutely affirm the phrase to die for.
The breads are wonderful...many varieties..the black and white cookies are always a weakness. 
Occasionally they have chocolate covered macaroons...which will definitely be part of my last meal....
I encourage anyone to stop in and give it a try. As others have said, the cashiers could use some customer service training, but the occasional surly employee is more than offset by the delicious breads and pastries."}
{"text":"To be honest, good reviews or not, I wasn't particularly impressed with Great Buns. When you call a bakery and ask if they have French bread -- which pretty much should be a staple of any general bakery -- you don't want to hear, \"Ummm... the long stick kind?\" When I said I was looking for a boule, not a baguette, she had no clue. Listen, if I go to Albertsons or Smiths, that would be about the level of professional, technical knowledge I'd expect, but really, in a bakery, you expect them to know basic bread. I ended up with the heavy Italian bread, and wasn't thrilled. The crust was bland and underdone. Just meh."}
{"text":"Great Buns Bakery, an uber-popular, family-owned bakery (three generations) is known for its wide variety of fresh baked breads and goods at very low prices (less than 50 cents each). Tucked in the back of a strip mall, it's also a major supplier to casinos across the city- so you may have already had the rolls- maybe you've seen the funny depiction of a well endowed backside/buns on a baker/mascot, on the delivery trucks. Closed sunday. Day old bread is marked down on a tall rack on your right as you enter the bakery (so cheap, making it harder to resist). Different size buns, assorted rolls, baguettes, bagels, coffee cake, and assorted pastries are among the long list of available freshly baked goods. If you were planning to make sandwiches, the possibilities are endless. It's self service with the breads, complete with tongs, baggies, and ties. You get the pastries at the counter, where you pay. Also available here are black and white cookies (my husband likes this version better than Freed's)- but this one sells out pretty fast.

This is not the place for you if you're trying to avoid carbs. It's hard for us to buy bread in large quantities (unless we freeze it) since it's just the two of us. But it's great for large families, parties, especially a barbeque since it's budget friendly ($5 gets you a lot here). Get here early for the best selection (mon-sat 7 am to 5 pm) and know that this place is very popular with the older set- we're usually the youngest ones here, besides some staff. After all, it's the best place to get fresh baked bread in the entire city- non-Asian, anyway. The staff is busy but still remain friendly and pleasant. This location burned down and was rebuilt a few years ago- it's the phoenix of bakeries. Long live Great Buns!"}
{"text":"I am so happy that we went to this place on a whim!

I just thought it was a standard bakery and I had no idea that there was an actual bakery factory on site. I felt like a little kid when I caught a glimpse of the large assembly lines behind the bread shelves. 

A great variety of bread and they even had some brownies to sample while we were there. Plenty of day old bread to even purchase on a discount. 

If you are buying a whole loaf of bread, be sure to ask them to cut it for you. Again, I was as excited as a little kid to watch them use the automatic bread slicing machine. It's the little things that get me, I guess. 

Friendly service, the place smells great, the price is reasonable, and everything that we bought tasted fantastic."}
{"text":"I was extremely stoked to come here after seeing the reviews, plus a recommendation from a fellow foodie. I was on a mission at 9am to eat some pastries, and lots of it. 

My mind was set on a croissant, cream cheese Danish, and anything that is flaky and buttery. 

I was a bit disappointed when I arrived. The croissants were not my favorite kind. They sorta reminded me of a slightly better version of Costco croissants. A couple of things weren't too bad, but nothing stood out for me. 

I gotta say though, they have inexpensive prices, and it's a great spot for possibly buying a ton of rolls for dinner."}
{"text":"5/5 for the white chocolate and white chocolate cranberry artisan dinner rolls. Get a dozen for $2 and some change. Don't even consider playing it safe and buying just one to try. You'll love them- I'm saving you the second trip back into the store since I know you'll want to go back in for the dozen. 

The croissants, bagels and danishes didn't stand out for me. 
The sample brownie on the counter did not give me high hopes for the breads I picked up for home. Don't sample it! haha. 

Take a peak behind the bread racks of bread to see the bread factory!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for the froo-froo pastries that you find on \"The Strip\", you're in the wrong place. If you're looking for solid, tasty and affordable baked goods, you hit the bullseye. 21 cents for crunchy/chewy/moist dinner rolls? You've got to be kidding! $1.49 for their largest pastries? In your face Smith's. Drop what your doing and get your buns over to Great Buns.
P.S.: make sure you have some room in your freezer and a few extra notches in your belt."}
{"text":"All I can say is just walk in this place and I dare you not to buy something.  Great sour dough.  If you like NY Bagels, don't get these.  They are more briochey than bagelly if you get what I mean."}

Bread at the Circle-K


Why anyone else would buy bread anywhere else is beyond my understanding."}
{"text":"Uggg, sooo goood! Glad they're across town from me. I mean, its so good that, even though I'm gluten-sensitive, I will make an exception when I'm in the area to stop by and get one of their round cinnamon pastry things. For those of you into a bready free-for-all, this is your place. They have countless varieties of all things wheat/pastry/cake. Service is great. Prices are cheapppp!

Get that round cinnamon pastry. Trust."}
{"text":"I LOVE their bagels. I also love their elephant ears and struesel. Recommend."}
{"text":"Now THIS is a bakery! Evyerhing seems as if it's made in-house. You walk in and the smell of fresh bread and pastries hits you in the face. It's awesome. You can even see the huge bakery thru an entrance near the front. I had a few of the cookies and they were really good. Everything seems as if the little old ladies that work there made it all by hand (until you see the big machines in the back! lol). Even the signs for the displays look like Grandma made them and the bread that's just a day old is deeply discounted...all the women there seems as if they've been working there for years and were very polite. 

This beats Wal*Mart for sure!"}
{"text":"I adore this place. I moved to this side of town a year ago, and this is now my go to bread place.

I think they are extremely affordable, especially since it is fresh baked locally and not sitting on a shelf after being shipped from who knows where. Even when I have left with a full bag of goodies I don't think I've ever spent more than $5-10.

They have excellent breads and rolls. My husband is a huge fan of their Pretzel buns, but I'm partial to their pumpernickel bread which is hard to find in most grocery stores. They have an amazing cheesy focaccia bread. Fantastic coconut macaroons. Honestly, I have loved everything I've tried so far.

Definitely worth checking out. My only complaint is that I'm a total night owl, and for me, they close pretty early."}
{"text":"Fantastic selection of high quality breads baked fresh every day from their commercial on-site bakery.
They must deliver to many big hotels, restaurants & grocery stores in Las Vegas.
I got their seeded rye bread which was absolutely perfect! A huge sliced loaf 4x the size of the Rye bread at Panera ($4.59) for less at $4.25!"}
{"text":"Amazing baked goods! I've lived in Vegas my whole life managed a bakery for the last 25 yrs and in the last two yrs been In a dozen times. Terrible customer service no one is pleasant and they have over charged my card twice."}
{"text":"So, I grab a cinnamon roll from here at least 5 days a week. They are always fresh and its never too busy. Sometimes I grab a danish or some shortbread cookies for coworkers (which are to die for). The one thing I don't like is that you can't use credit or debit for transactions under $5.00, I hardly ever carry cash so this is a little inconvenient for me. Other than that, this place is awesome!"}
{"text":"Esta panadería italiana me gusta mucho , soy amante del pan , las pastas, los rabioles de 3 quesos buenísimos, la masa para pizza muy buena y el café también es delicioso..."}
{"text":"What an amazing bakery find! Located on Tropicana and Pecos in a strip mall, the small parking area was busy with cars with people heading straight to the bakery early in the morning. I take that as a good sign. The minute you walk in, the smell of warm bread fills your nose and the sound of bakers working away is all around. The walls are lined with different kinds of rolls, pretzel breads, muffins, danishes, croissants, almond pastry rings, rosemary bread, cannoli, brownies, sandwich bread, bagels, and bundt cakes. The best part of the whole bakery besides the freshness and selection are the prices! Very very affordable. Since the bakery supplies to hotels, restaurants and casinos, the sheer volume they bake means the public can buy these goods at an exceptionally great price. I bought several brownies, danishes, and cannolis for about $12 which at any given coffee? shop bakery would of cost me at least twice as much. Everyone was so sweet and helpful too. Some items are not self serve like the cannolis and brownies so the lady behind the counter had to box it up for me. She was very professional and friendly. I am definitely making this bakery my go to spot for fresh pastries and breads.  You can't beat the price for the quality you are getting. No wonder there was so many people coming and going in here. There is also a dedicated section for wholesaler for pick up and ordering, but it wasn't in the way of the general public browsing through and making purchases. Overall, I highly recommend this bakery. The place is clean, the service is friendly, the goodies are tasty, and the prices are great. Will be coming back for more."}
{"text":"I love Great Buns Bakery. This place is literally a giant bakery warehouse where you can get cinnamon rolls, pastries, bagels, bread, pies, cookies, and more! The prices are very reasonable; for example, I pay only $1.49 for a huge cinnamon roll that takes me 2 breakfasts to eat.

The only bummer about this bakery is that they don't carry donuts, but they more than make up for it with their variety in other baked goods. 

Tip: Take cash unless you plan on spending more than $5 (which is the minimum for credit card purchases)."}
{"text":"One word of advice to anyone looking to visit this place; \"GO.\"  We were referred to this place by a local establishment selling their sourdough bread as toast.  I was very impressed at the selection and size of this bakery.  

The service is quick and with a  smile.  

My finding that are now going to be my go to items; the brownies, sourdough bread, the steak rolls and the red velvet cupcakes. 

The steak rolls and larger sandwich rolls are so amazing, they will make anything you put on them taste better."}
{"text":"This place does not have management? ! They were busy as hell,and slow,slow,slow,slow that was just killing me,I love the bread it is really good but  personal it slow .I give 5 start for the bakery  and 0000000 start for the SLOW SLOW Employees, and instead of helping to ring up the costumers they were doing other stuff and OWNER PUT ATTENTION TO YOUR BUSINESS!"}
{"text":"Love it! Right out of the oven bread. I can't believe I drove by this place many times and did not realize what I was missing. The croissants, baguettes, Italian cookies, danishes they are all very good. Crispy in the outside and soft from the inside. It brought back childhood memories. You can smell the deliciousness as soon as you drive in, in the morning. The first time I went was 5 days ago and I came back for more. I treated family and friends to try. Definitely recommend for everyone to try."}
{"text":"Meh.  As a New Yorker, I've tried all types of bakery products (German, Italian, Jewish). I had high hopes for GBB after reading the Yelp reviews, but was very disappointed. We went to Great Buns on 23 October and tried the following products: 

Raisin bread: very few raisins; no 'swirl' in the center. I checked my receipt to confirm I'd bought raisin bread.
Apple turnovers: Hostess' & McDonald's are better (seriously); very little apple filling. 
Chocolate muffin: no flavor whatsoever. 
Black and White Cookie: below average. Anyone on the hunt for good B&W cookies will NOT find them here. Order some from these places if you're craving the real thing: http://newyork.cbslocal.com/top-lists/nycs-5-best-black-white-cookies/"}
{"text":"Checked out Great Buns based on the Yelp reviews and I came in with such high hopes, but was left unamused.

They had a ton of fresh bakery products, from bread, rolls, pastries, cakes, etc.  The selection is abundant and is made in mass quantities.  That's where I think I was let down.  I got a cinnamon roll, cheese danish, almond croissant, and a muffin.  I could already tell that the quality generic just by looking at it, but I wanted to actually taste it.  Overall, the pastries were dry and practically tasteless.  I was hoping the cinnamon roll would've had cream cheese frosting, but it was just straight up a sugar glaze.  The cheese danish reminded me of when I was a kid and ate those Entenmann's danished wrapped in plastic.  On the bright side, the muffin was good, and their sandwich rolls looked tempting.

Prices, yeah I can't fault them at all, it's CHEAP!  I'd maybe come back here if I were given a task to buy 4 dozen pastries for a club, on the cheap.

I love my pastries, breads, croissants, donuts, cakes, etc.  And I really had such high hopes for GBB.  I'm not comparing it to Jean Philippe Patisserie, Bouchon, or even Paris Baguette but man, it's sad that I've had better tasting bakery products from Safeway.

{"text":"Hello and welcome to Great Buns Bakery. Simply put this is one of the best Bakeries in Las Vegas. It is almost an Iconic place to get the best bread and pastries in the valley. From cookies to rolls. Pastries and small to big loaves of bread you can't go wrong. They can get very busy around many of the big holidays so time your day right. I also think some of the local sandwich shops get here early and get all the Hoagie rolls because one dude drove in fast and absconded with 3 big bags of them. They have a day old section as well and even those choices can be fresh tasting at a discount. Thanks for visiting Great Buns Bakery. I will and have returned here several times. Always worth a small trip out of the way. Parking lot can be a little tricky so drive safe here. Check it out for your next gathering, you will not be sorry."}
{"text":"This is a great bakery all there food is fantastic. It always smells so good in there I love there fresh baked cupcake tops"}
{"text":"My dad's been coming to this cute little place for quite some time. He loves quality food and their bread and pastries are definitely fresh and delicious. 

B and I were feeling like something sweet so we chose an apple pastry and a pineapple one. We thought the pineapple was lemon so that was kind of a surprise but it was still good. My dad picked out a few loaves of bread. 

The bakery actually supplies a lot of local businesses and is much larger than it looks. The front section is where you can pick out all of your items but you can peek into the back where all of the production takes place. All of the ladies working were suuuper helpful and friendly. It's just one of those quirky, cool little spots that's totally Vegas."}
{"text":"On my way to a dance workshop a couple weekends ago, I was contacted by the organizer asking if I could possibly stop for croissants somewhere.  I pulled up my trusty Yelp app and found Great Buns. 

I'd driven by this spot several times, but never thought to stop in.

I ended up leaving with a couple of plain croissants and a couple of almond croissants, and was NOT disappointed!

The price was on point for how big these were, and they were soft and delicious.  I didn't think about taking pictures, sadly, but I plan to go back again, so I will snag photos next time."}

Opened in 1982 and baking fresh bread on East Tropicana for more than ten hours a day from Monday through Saturday since 1988 it was finally on Saturday morning that I made my way to Great Buns Bakery and although often exalted by locals as some of the Valley's best bread my experience unfortunately proved average at best, the high-scale production and bargain basement prices harkening ingredients and methods no more impressive than that of the average corner store.  Owned and operated by \"4th generation bakers\" per the in-store propaganda and prominently displaying its New York-Italian roots in several of its offerings it was to a quarter-full store that I arrived just moments shy of 9:30 and with elderly servers otherwise occupied I took my time to peruse, the largely automated operation whirring in the background as several younger staff members took turns restocking shelves.  Treated to samples of crumbly sour-cream cake on the backside of the counter as I wandered past a pair of chillers it was only after ten minutes that I finally crafted my order and although neither the red velvet cupcakes nor cornbread I'd desired were yet ready a half-dozen items tallying $7.26 were soon boxed and ready to go, my first taste of a still-warm pretzel roll enjoyed as I exited the shop originally giving me hope of things to come but eventually proving to be the only standout of the bunch.   Clearly not expecting the quality of Bouchon or Bonjour given the obvious discrepancy in price and production it was after a short drive and with coffee in hand that my sampling continued and starting small with an entremet of apple strudel the taste simply fell flat, a dry puff pastry with artificial tasting filling that carried right over a slightly superior tart again compromised by a core I'm rather certain was Smucker's supplied.  At this point with expectations decidedly dwindling it was into a soft almond croissant that teeth tore and discarding more than half of the doughy debacle before tasting a fairly forgettable black & white cookie I thankfully found some solace in the sticky pecan bun with ample notes of butter beneath a lacquer of cinnamon-sugar drizzled nuts."}
{"text":"Great Buns Bakery is a Las Vegas institution. They've been around for nearly 35 years, so they know a thing or two about what it takes to consistently deliver great buns. 

I've driven past this place a trillion times, but never dropped in. Mainly, because I didn't think they were open to the public. WRONG!  Also, Great Buns Bakery is one of the main suppliers for breads to our local casinos and restaurants. 

On my first visit, I sampled what looked like a chocolate Hostess cupcake, s'mores brownie, mini cannoli, and a black & white cookie. Everything was splendid - especially the brownie! It wasn't too cakey, yet it wasn't to gooey either. Probably the best brownie I've ever tasted. 

All this came to only $7. I've paid $7 for only one tasty treat at many establishments they were just mediocre. You cannot and will not beat Great Buns wholesale prices, nor the quality. 

If you're anything like me and my girl, Oprah, who really luuuuv bread, then check out Great Buns Bakery."}
{"text":"While Vegas these days is primarily known for facsimile star-chef restaurants and \"god knows how they manage to sell a $3 'prime' rib dinner\" this place is a top notch bakery in its own right.

As soon as you walk in, you can see that they mean business, as if you peek behind the displays you'll see that the bakery itself takes up four times the space of the retail section.  I came in with some local friends and their 3 year old and immediately she says \"what's that smell?  mmmm\"  Guess that passes the second test. In any case, I had a cheese danish that was just the perfect balance of crust, soft fresh dough, and sweet filling.  I'm not even sure that I can find such a bakery in my home town of San Francisco.  Sure, there are a number of fancy \"patisserie\" places, but fewer traditional bakeries of this caliber.  They also had an array of various breads and other sweet pastries in the American/European tradition.

However, the best part of this visit was that I had my apple turnover, Danish, and cinnamon stick all at around 1:30PM...no need to wake up extra early for fresh baked, since the stuff moves so quickly out of the door that they keep the ovens going constantly.  For a town not often known for \"real\" food...this place is an oasis in the desert."}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming here. The people are wonderful the bread is great. I wish they had butter by the front door"}
{"text":"A few years ago this place was burnt down if I remember correctly. It was rather sad going there one day and just seeing the blacken reminisce of a great bakery. It is nice to see that they have rebuilt and have become bigger without losing the quality of their product. My family and I always loved their French bread. We buy it to go with curries or Vietnamese beef stew. There is something special about this bread. It has a nice crispy flaky outside while the center is moist and spongy. Perfect for soaking up all the wonderful flavors of whatever dish you are eating.

Their rolls are also great if you want to make Vietnamese subs. They are a little bit more pricey then a supermarket, but the quality is unsurpassed. 

I am glad that it is a bit of a drive otherwise I might be the size of a house."}
{"text":"Where I have been, or rather, why haven't I been in here before now?  Just walking in the door, I knew my eyes grew bigger than my stomach and I was putting items in the basket quickly.  

There were too many items to enjoy today, but we managed to make a few select choices, the items were all fresh, smelled heavily and looked beautiful. 

There were many people shopping today, the line for check out was double on both sides.  Prices seem reasonable, the quality and freshness is perfect, a good place for yummy breads, rolls, and pastries."}
{"text":"Buns, and more buns!

This bakery has a lot of amazing breads and treats to choose from. The location is a bit hidden from the street, but worth venturing to find. My first visit I got a number of items: croissants, pumpernickel loaf of bread, black and white cookies, and more. In total 7.95 for all my carb treats so very inexpensive. I haven't eaten everything, but the croissant and cookie were delicious perhaps next time I'll make it into a croissant and egg sandwich. I'm happy to have found a tasty bread place in this part of town."}
{"text":"I saw this place by accident after taking my family to IHOP for breakfast while visiting Las Vegas. On a whim, I went in and took a look around. What I found was a yeasty heaven of goodness inside of a busy bakery. They had just about every bread that can be thought of. I bought and enjoyed the mini pound cakes (moist and delicious), sourdough bread and farmers bread. The customer service was delightful. I will go back and buy another car trunk of bread next time I am in the area. GO and try it!!!"}
{"text":"In my opinion the best bakery in Vegas! Excellent quality and taste at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I went based on Laura D's recommendation and this could be the equivalent to bread heaven!  One thing my wife has been commenting/complaining about has been the lack of quality bakeries off the strip.  Well...she plans on coming here at least once a week now.  We just went with the baguette ($1.40), a cinnamon roll,  and a mixed bag of bagels.  The bagels were just ok but I am spoiled after living in NYC but the first 2 were fantastic.  I guess I am going to have to start running more often!"}
{"text":"I love bread and great buns have lots of it. Super fresh and delicious. The best deal is the day old bread, but you have to get there early. I freeze most of it, thaw it in the bag and warm it up in the oven, It gets warm on the inside and crusty on the out. 
its a million times better than what you'll get at a grocery store."}
{"text":"The buns are great! But the customer service not so much! Plus our order has been wrong several times...Good product is important yes! But no matter if your busy,short handed, whatever.. Customer service is key!"}
{"text":"This bakery has been here forever and I absolutely love it. They have all different types of pasties and different rolls . It looks like a commercial style bakery. The smell is amazing with the fresh smell of freshly baked everything. I love the almond croissants , they are very delicious. I would highly recommend if you haven't tried them already. Just to save you a trip get the almond croissant ring ."}
{"text":"I personally love this bakery but it is too far away!!  From bakery to bakery you will find that the sugar content changes even when comparing what you think are \"like\" products. For instance, a cream puff, if you are at a french bakery the cream puff may look the same but they generally go lighter on the sugar ingredient so you may even be able to detect a slight egg taste in the pastry, Jewish bakeries and Mexican bakeries also tend to go lighter on the sugar so although it is a tasy treat I often walk away thinking it was good but I have had better. Great Buns bakes the way I like it. The Cream Puffs a light and fluffy and sweet like I believe a dessert should be. Not sugary, mind you, just sweet and delicious. Obviously there are bakeries that have slightly changed their recipes to meet the American sweet tooth market and this is one of those bakeries.

As an extra bonus, if you call them and tell them you are looking for a certain treat such as a Napolean, if they don't have them available that day they will try to accomodate your request by making them the following day or day after.  They have always been wonderful about trying to fill your sweet tooth cravings for you.  BTW Napoleans are very hard to find around town and theirs are to die for!!  Call ahead and make sure you arrive on a day they have Napoleans available. You will not be disappointed... :)"}
{"text":"First, I'm a retired Chef and restaurant consultant - so I know what I'm talking about.  Add to that I'm exceptionally careful with my money aka \"Cheap.\"  :) Great Buns offers high quality products at a VERY affordable price.  Their business is spotlessly clean, the service is down-home friendly w/out pretentiousness.  The variety is off the charts good.  Dollar for dollar you will not get any better in all of Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Lots of baked items. Love their white Choco cranberry rolls. Good cupcakes & pecan rolls. Limited hours. Clean space."}
{"text":"My favorite thing about this place is the overwhelmingly sweet smell of freshly baked bread once you walk through the door.

My second favorite thing is the bread. It tastes as good as it smells. The crust is perfect, while the center is nice and soft. I always opt for sourdough loaves when I come here and the taste is always consistent and sour enough for my liking.

As for pricing, this place is SO affordable. Most loaves on average are $3 and they have a discount section of day old bread for $1.69. I picked up a bag of six large pretzel buns and they were still amazing and soft despite being a day old.

They also have pastries, muffins, cakes, and bagels. The sweets are by no means decadent, but does it really matter in a place like this? What matters is the taste and the muffins and pound cake taste pretty damn good for the price. They also have fresh pasta to satisfy all your carb needs ~ 

Lastly, they have a $5 minimum for debit and credit cards. Bring cash if you only plan on buying one loaf."}
{"text":"Great bread... great cinnamon rolls...super friendly service and good prices.  So glad I stumbled across this place. They also sell dough so I'm going to buy that next time to make pizza at home."}
{"text":"Great variety of fresh baked goods including rolls, cakes, almond croissants etc. Reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"One of the best bakeries I ever got goodies from... the red velvet cupcake was so flavorful and moist and the frosting was so creamy... their eclairs and cannolis are also excellent. I highly recommend this bakery to everyone!"}
