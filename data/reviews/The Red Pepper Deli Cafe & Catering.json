{"text":"My family and I stopped in for lunch and we all ordered sandwiches on separate tabs. All food was served at the same time and was wonderful, very yummy and we highly recommend it for lunch."}
{"text":"Love the Red Pepper - John and Lori have done a great job of creating a warm, welcoming environment.  Their employees are always happy to see you and so pleasant throughout your entire dining experience.  The sandwiches are delicious and there are so many options.  My parents eat at the Red Pepper every time they visit from Indianapolis (except on Sundays ;))  When making dining recommendations to out-of-towners, I always have the Red Pepper as my top choice!  Keep up the great work!!!  P.S. Check out their daily sandwich special - they are typically amazing!!!"}
{"text":"For a quick bite that is tasty and not a typical fast food chain try the Red Pepper. The sandwiches are great and they have a variety of tasty homemade soups."}
{"text":"really good food and reasonably priced.  a definite must eat at in Madison.  plenty of seating for large groups."}
{"text":"This is usually a great lunch spot, not today.  There is no Wi-Fi and when you ask for the password, the clerk states there isn't one.  When you show the clerk the screen that wants a password enter you are told the owners say there is not one.  Well, I never was able to connect to the Wi-Fi.  The potatoes in the potato salad were not cooked throughout. Some were very crunchy, some only part of the potato was crunchy. Extremely disappointing meal.  Oh yes, the sandwich special does not mean a discounted special price."}
{"text":"It's never a good start when the first words out of their mouths at a deli are \"we're out of panini bread\".  The food was average decent but lacked any real special quality.  We both had 1/2 sandwich and cup of soup.  Hubby had the Lanier and it was blah, messy, croissant was stale.  His broccoli cheddar soup seemed overcooked, thin and also lacked flavor.  I had the Turkey Pesto panini, which was singed black on both sides and lacked any real flavor, just bland.  I did love the chicken tortilla soup (sans tortillas, apparently they just call it tortilla soup).  It was fresh, loaded full and tasted great once it cooled off to an edible temperature.  Kind of wish we'd have gone with the locally famous burger joint.  Thought it was slightly pricey at $24 for lunch in a basket."}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal. Everytime I'm in Madison, I stopped here at least once. The pasta salad is maybe the best thing I've ever eaten (sugary, salty, spicy... tasty).  My wife is from Madison, and I had never experienced this place until I'm at my in-laws, great place for a first meeting and for conversation.  Parking can be a little awkward at lunch time but there's plenty of seats inside and little nooks and crannies where you can disappear, or there is a patio. Can't say enough about the food."}
{"text":"I didn't hate it but it's as much of a deli as Quiznos. It was an OK sandwich on mushy bread that was supposed to be a baggette, a bag of Lays chips, and a limp pickle."}
{"text":"This place was a surprise and a delight. I needed a quick lunch and lucked into a huge, amazingly tasty sandwich for a reasonable price.  They have a huge selection of food, they cater, and they serve dinner. The service was cheerful, attentive and quick.   Parking is a little confusing, but I realized that you just park wherever you want in their wrap around lot. The decorations were interesting, but not as impressive as their food.  I would gladly go back to try some of their other offerings."}
{"text":"Love this place. In town on business never expected this in a small town. Food is amazing. Tried the pesto wrap first, had wild rice in it, and I loved it"}
{"text":"Food was made to order.  Sandwiches were fresh and above average.  For example, my veggie sandwich had freshly grated carrots on it instead of pre-shredded like you can buy at the grocery store.  The kids meal grilled cheese came with a cookie, pickles and a bag of plain potato chips.  It was plenty of food for my two kids (7 & 1.5) to share.  We didn't have any of the speciality salads (broccoli, pasta and potato) but they looked really good.  The only thing I would change is the price since a sandwich with a bag of plain chips and a pickle runs around $7-8.  The unsweetened iced tea was terrific!"}
{"text":"One of my customers recommended this place as I drove to it is was a little concerned but thought I would give it a try. I ordered the Tuscan Turkey sandwich and it was really good!"}
{"text":"I had the Red Pepper cater my wedding in May of 2011. They did a fantastic job, we wanted heavy appetizers so everyone could snack all night. They came up with a few menu options all which were amazing. The pricing per person was fantastic compared to every where else I looked we planned on having 250-300 guests. They were very professional with setting up and communicating to us. They are a fabulous group I HIGHLY recommend them to anyone looking for a great cater oh and the food was AMAZING! Everyone complemented it.                      i"}
{"text":"Awesome deli place. My favorite sandwich is the Stromboli. I've been here a few times. Most people that have gone with me have said their food is also great. Would definitely visit if your in town. Great for lunches."}
{"text":"They've got a good selection of sandwiches and panini stop choose from that come with a bag of Lay's chips and a pickle spear which will run about $7-$10 per person. Kids can choose from grilled cheese, hot ham and cheese or PB & J."}
{"text":"They had a couple of veggie options, which is always a plus. The bread for my sandwich was less than fresh, but the toppings were fine. Styrofoam cups for the fountain bevs, REALLY? Who uses styrofoam anymore? My friend had the veg burrito, which was clearly premade - still frozen on the outside but fresh off a couple of minutes on the grill so part of it was slightly warm. Le sigh."}
{"text":"First visit to Madison in a few years, friends recommended the Red Pepper. Great selection, takes a few minutes to make a choice. Sandwiches and soup very good."}
{"text":"Simple...clean...sandwich shop with above average ingredients...  good food...great people....nice atmosphere  I have been here many times for a variety of festivals and events in Madison...which is a well kept secret for some reason"}
{"text":"great sandwich shop. the owner is down to earth, and i actually spotted him cleaning the bathrooms. that's commitment.  pricing seems a little high for a lunch-centric place, but that's my only gripe."}
