{"text":"Nice place to relax while your are waiting for your flight, i got the buffalo wings and my wife got the chicken wrap sandwich, both were good and tasty. Waitress Marie was very nice and friendly with a cute smile, I will stop by there on my next flight."}
{"text":"I hate leaving negative reviews but come on, breakfast came out lukewarm and tasted like leftover buffet items put through a microwave. I told them this feedback in person and nothing was done - ie. no attempt to make it better, no discount, no apologies from cook or management, nada. Wake up, you aren't even trying."}
{"text":"Stopped here to grab a few drinks before a late take off back to NYC.  Nothing special.  $9 for a glass of wine."}
{"text":"The interior was very nice and the staff was very kind where possible.  Only I couldn't carry on a conversation because the manager's were very nasty.  Every sentence one of the  manager's would rudely interrupt. This while trying to talk to the waiter. They spent a ton of money on the interior but I hate the management of this place.  The food was OK but everything here was extremely expensive.  I wish they had better managers running the show.  I would not recommend this place of business"}
{"text":"Airport food is never really that great..... Village Pub at Mccarran International Airport has set the bar very high.  Other airports need to take notice and follower their lead.   The fish and chips were OUTSTANDING!!!"}
{"text":"Stay away from this place. The service is horrible. Especially if you get Jeff as your server. He is rude, disrespectful and does not belong in the service industry. This is a seat yourself establishment that had only virtually no customers when I popes in to grab a bite prior to my flight. He apparently got upset that my party of 3 took up 6 seats. ( there was over 50 seats available) Instead of asking us to move.... he ranted around the restaurant flapping  his arms, telling all his coworkers how we just HAD to spread out. When I tried to talk to him about it, he got even ruder. There are so many places at the airport to eat, there is no need to waste your money here."}
