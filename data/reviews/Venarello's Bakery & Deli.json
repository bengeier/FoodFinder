{"text":"This is the classic Canadian-Italian Bakery with a hot table. It's owner operated & you can tell \"he cares\"! It's personal hands on service from the owner Rocco.   I had the Veal sandwich with veggies. It was soft & tender & delicious & of course it was home made. The delightful & polite owner was kind enough to comp me an espresso. I LOVE Italian Espresso. If your in the area of Dufferin & Lawrence area & you're looking for a bite to eat...stop in, it's definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast on the weekend. It was okay. It was pretty flavourless. I don't think I would come again for breakfast but maybe I'd come to try the lunch. Pasta smelt good. The place had a relaxed atmosphere. The service was good and cannoli was tasty."}
