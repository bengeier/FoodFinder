{"text":"The best Chocolate waffles and ice cream anywhere. Forget all the new trendy coffee shops the Harbour bar was serving milky coffees years before anyone else - good prices and if you go in you have to have the waffles and ice cream with chocolate sauce they are the best. And of course the sea view. And in evening just stop by for an ice cream"}
{"text":"Hot Chocolate at Winter = AMAZING"}
{"text":"Absolutely love Harbour Bar ice cream, especially a nice neopolitan tub! There general meal menu is also really nice. Can't recommend this place highly enough, excellant customer service - there is always plenty of staff on even during quieter times. a must for any visitor to scarborough."}
{"text":"My memories of banana splits and ice cream sundaes at the Harbour Bar are getting rather dim at this point, though fondly remembered. They were what I always looked forward to as a kid - humungous amounts of top-quality ice-cream, whipped cream and all the trimmings, such as only a kid's iron constitution could stomach. As an adult my tastes have matured - well, as far as preferring an ice cream soda and frothy coffee, anyway! An ice-cream soda with the Harbour Bar's top-quality cherryade is certainly a treat - I haven't come across cherryade with such a sumptuously fruity flavour and delicate shade of pink anywhere else (despite trying). In fact I'm yearning for one right now Go on, give this place a visit - your inner child will thank you."}
{"text":"Fantastic place to chill for the whole family great atmophere"}
{"text":"Great ice cream, they make it themselves in the ice cream factory at the back of the Harbour Bar. Well worth a visit, having been coming here for years. In my opinion the best in Scarborough."}
{"text":"The harbour bar is a lovely place to stop in and have a hot choclate on cold days, it gets a bit crowded in summer but sells lovely icecream the prices are reasonable and service always friendly."}
{"text":"Wer in die Nähe kommt oder am besten ganz in Scarborough Urlaub macht, sollte den Besuch im Cafe auf keinen Fall versäumen! Von Giulian Alonzi 1945 eröffnet ist die Einrichtung bis heute fast unverändert. Die langen Schlangen im Sommer sind berechtigt und das Warten darin jede Zeit wert, denn man bekommt hier wohl das beste und prämierte Eis ganz Englands.    Ein Slogan von den vielen, die an den Wänden zu lesen sind, lautet: 'Get your vitamins the easy way, Eat ice cream every day.'!"}
{"text":"some of the other reviews I don't agree with everyone has off days. Everytime we have been customer service has been great. The ice cream is to die for!! Once you have tried it you will understand why people que to get it.  I think that it is still made by the same family since it opened which my mum has said was about 50 years ago at least"}
{"text":"Best value bacon sarnnies in Scarborough and the milk shakes  wow"}
{"text":"Must have been an off day when my girlfriend and I called. We sat at the bar and looked hopefully at three teenage girls behind the counter who were staring at the floor. Eventually one looked up and asked if she could help. I ordered two ice creams. They arrived after she had asked someone else how to make them. One was in the glass and on a saucer with a spoon. The other was half on the outside of the glass, no saucer and no spoon. Shoddy service is not acceptable. tasted ok though"}
{"text":"A Samuel Smith pub. Where they only sell the lovely brews of the wonderful brewer Sammy Smith. It might be a let down if you're looking for a pint of Carling or a Stella. But the brews are good enough & blooming cheap too. Rare is it that you can get a pint for under two pounds. Here they have a selection for under that princely sum. The main bar is small & frequently crowded. But they have a beer garden & a lounge up a set of steps for us old none too sociable golf. I'm quite enchanted by the place myself."}
{"text":"If you're a fan of soft serve ice cream this is the place for you. There were ten different varieties of swirl ice cream on offer, with all manner of sprinkles, toppings, flakes, fudge sticks, and more.   The place is pretty small inside so we got out waffle cones to go. Good price considering the size of the portions! My raspberry swirl was like fruit sorbet swirled with a mini milk, but sweet and fruity without being tart. Don't except imitations, this place is the real deal!"}
{"text":"Quite simply gorgeous ice cream.and there's always a queue, which means plenty of other people think exactly the same as me!"}
{"text":"One side of my family live in Scarborough so I have visited often all my life and come to know the best parts very well. The seafront engages the history of the town and combines it with the modern touristy approach. Its beautiful long beaches are ideal to take the family for a walk in the winter or picnic and donkey ride in the summer. The shoreline is laden with shops and restaurants which although have been there for many years provide a modern twist to the vintage town.    Harbour Bar is one these as seems to have been there forever yet keeps up with modern expectations and preferances. It fits in perfectly next to the harbour - selling ice creams at excellent prices. The quality of the icecream is a lot better than what you'd find in a bog standard ice cream van. The service isn't amazing yet it doesn't seem to matter as its very prompt and sooner or later you are enjoying your '99 strolling by the lifeboat station. In the winter when the weather isn't at its best you can always sit in and order something warm either a hot drink or hot food if ice cream isn't your fancy on a cold day!    It's clean and modern yet represents the beauty of the town of Scarborough - definately recommended for all the family!"}
