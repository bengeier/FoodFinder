{"text":"Maha's mind blowing chicken sandwich is the signature. 2 hours wait is their signature too. If you have lots of free time it's worth trying the food but if your time is valuable 2 hours is gonna cost you at least 100 bucks interms of time. Need to upgrade the place to a bigger one. I won't go since I don't like the waiting time."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! The food is incredible and the servers/owner is so sweet. Has a lovely intimate atmosphere and nice decor, the food looks very nice and tastes even better. As an egyptian, I have to say I was impressed.
Only down side is the lengthy wait, but I guess that's what happens when a place is so great!"}
{"text":"You heard correct - the line up is long, even on a Monday. We waited for an hour, which was fine and expected.

What was not expected was the long wait for service and once ordered, food preparation. The staff are friendly enough but are slow at setting tables, getting menus and orders in. 

The food is great - we especially liked the Po Boy, even more than the infamous Mindblowing Chicken, but in my opinion, wasn't worth the 2h 15m wait to get in, order, and for the food to come."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went there on a week day at noon: 

Our meals were excellently prepared.My partner had the shrimp pita sandwich and I had the Egyptian falafel. Both were delicious and really tasty, the Egyptian falafel though was something we had never seen before and it is served with cumin fries and salad which is great! 
I also ordered the honey and cardamom latte , it was delicious !!! (Seriously it was amazing ! )
Friendly staff but took a while to get the menus and to clean the tables !"}
{"text":"This is what I call a classic, \"falling for the hype\"!

I have been wanting to come here for a while now. My first attempt was last year on a gloomy rainy Sunday. My mister and I saw the line's projected wait time to be about 45 mins so we thought we'd try again another day. We went back a year later, this past Sunday. It was just an ordinary place, ordinary food. I personally don't think its worth the wait time (we got in within 30 mins since there was just the two of us) or the drive. It was okay, I just didn't taste what was so special about it. But, its a check mark of my places to try so glad I tried it! 

We got the mind-blowing chicken sandwich, the cairo classic and the basturma scramble - all of which we thought to be quite salty. They have amazing falafel and the honey-cardommon latte was also very refreshing!"}
{"text":"huge fan of this place. 
recommendations... 
drinks:
- the cardamom latte is so good.

food:
- mind blowing chicken
- basturma scramble
- lentil soup

love the decor in this place. very cool... but would recommend expanding. the wait times are like a little unbearable (2 hours on a weekend) and table sharing isn't really fun."}
{"text":"You've been warned about the long wait times so it's no reason for anyone to complain. Come prepared to put your name down and return in a hour or two. 

We ordered: 
- appetizer platter: very worth it if you're with 3-4 people. 
- Lentil soup: creamy and filling (friends could only finish half) 
- Cairo classic: their most popular dish. 
- Mind blowing chicken: tastes like a chicken shawarma in between a Big Mac bun. 
- Egyptian Falafel
- Turkish coffee
- Honey-cardamom latte

If I came back, I'd reorder: Appetizer platter, mind blowing chicken and Turkish coffee. 

Do 
- Come in a small group (no more than 4 - there are only 24 seats) 
- Order to share. Although the dishes are entre style, I found it repetitive after 5 bites. Plus, it's a good way to try as many dishes as possible. 
- Try one of their coffee/teas 

Maha is a unique option for brunch in Toronto. The service is slow but at least the staff are friendly!"}
{"text":"We were just there for brunch and it was fantastic.  Cozy little restaurant with warm and inviting staff.  I had the Cairo Classic and my partner had grilled cheese with dates.  Both were really delicious.  We'll definitely be going back and I encourage everyone else to give it a try."}
{"text":"great place to tray egiption branch . fresh and elegant
foul, flalfel and everything in the menu must be traied.go there and see by yourself."}
{"text":"If rated on food alone: 3.5/4 because portions were small but decent and food was great. 

Service on the other hand was terrible.  The place was busy so we had to wait awhile before being seated and when we did get our seats ,  we ordered right away but  waited over an hour for our food--WHILE other people who got seated after we did got their food before us, which made absolutely no sense because we ALSO placed our orders before they did as well. 

Our server knew we were upset,  knew we were waiting a long time and asked her to check our orders for us but she did not seem to bother in acknowledging the fact that we were waiting a very long time for the food,  nor did she even try to explain why the wait was as long as it was,  just to at least help us understand what the hell was taking so long. The only time she seemed to hurry was when we asked for the bill immediately after we got our food...  Again,  an hour and fifteen minutes later. 

Food is good but the poor service and long wait ruined our mood,  our plans for the day and our appetite. The only reason why we waited was because there was nothing else around the area to go to,  so I suggest you either plan ahead if you decide to go to Maha or just know that you're going to spend more time waiting for your food than actually eating it."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go to this place for a while and I am glad I did!  Met up with a friend and we had lunch on a Tuesday.  The Honey and Cardamom latte was made lactose free for me and it was pretty and DELICIOUS!  That alone will keep me coming back for more :).  Had the Cairo breakfast (forget what it was officially called but it was recommended to me as their most popular dish).  Was delicious!  I will definitely be back to try out more of the options.  Great addition to the hood and it is such a cute and quaint place to hang out."}
{"text":"The food was ok. The lineup is extremely long so by the time we got in they had run out of half the food??? How do you run out of mind blowing chicken if it's on the menu and you expect this many people on a daily basis. Everything else on the menu was mediocre :\"}
{"text":"Waited for an hour and a half simply because they don't have a way to manage the line. First come first served rule is not applied. You have to be very careful, and question them if needed."}
{"text":"Longest wait ever - we arrived at 2 and got our food at 4:30pm. No take out on weekends. BUT the food is legit Egyptian. It's a family business that brings you to Egypt. 
We basically ordered everything on the menu (the meat is halal) my favourite basterma with scrambled eggs. 
I recommend it!"}
{"text":"The soft boiled egg falafel was exceptional. Great service too. This is one of the best meals I've had in Toronto in a while, let alone the best brunch."}
{"text":"Delicious food, friendly service, and decent pricing - this place does all three! We ordered the Mindblowing chicken sandwich and the Cairo Classic, with hummus and cumin fries on the side. The chicken sandwich was messy and overflowing but every bite was fantastic. The Cairo Classic was really good, with perfectly cooked egg and a nice falafel on top, with delicious buttery pita and a nice creamy yogurt sauce on the side. Hummus is on par with the best I've ever tasted - and I've travelled in the Middle East! 

As for service, this place is small and they get rammed. I can understand if a server gets overwhelmed with that from time to time. We had a 20 minute wait for a table at around 12:30 on a Saturday, and got our food within 15 minutes of ordering, which is perfectly reasonable. Plus, our server Mark, who is Maha's son, was friendly and warm and attentive and never made us feel rushed. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Maha's food.  The eggs with Basterma has been a favorite of mine and the lattes are amazing.  The place is quite small so make sure you get there early."}
{"text":"Pretty much the worst service I've ever experienced. An hour an half wait is the norm on the weekend. And being on the wait list doesn't mean a whole lot, if they can seat a bigger party at a small table, that seems to be their preference. 
Awful, what a waste of two hours on our weekend."}
{"text":"Love it. Fresh and done right. The food doesn't sway much from authentic Egyptian food .In an age of fake fusion , this is a pleasant surprise. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"From the hearty food to the friendly wait-staff, my mother and I had an amazing breakfast here. The honey-cardamom latte is such a treat."}
{"text":"We went in there with high hopes for the food and ready to wait a longer time for it. Surprisingly there was no waiting involved for a 2 person table at a sunday morning and the service was nice, too. Unfortunately, I was lent down by the food, not necessarily the taste, but rather the portion. As they were out of the falafel and the porridge couldn't be prepared with a milk substitute, I took the lentil soup for 9 bucks expecting a nice big bowl, but NO. the tiniest little cup of soup aside with the TINIEST cup of a few cut tomatoes and onions - for 9$ ?! I was massively disappointed and of course still hungry after.
That was rather a joke :( The soup tasted ok (also, not \"award winning\" as they claim)."}
{"text":"The place is small. Can seat about 20 ppl at any given time which causes the 45 minute line up. Love how the ambience of the place though with a lot of personal decor touches. The food was good but the service was a little slow. Making the experience a little sour."}
{"text":"Waited over an hour to get a table on a Sunday but it was well worth it! The cardamom latte was divine, and the Cairo Classic was hearty and flavourful, and the Mindblowing Chicken Sandwich was excellent and inexpensive considering how big and meaty it is. Our server was very busy and looked a little frazzled as the restaurant was packed, but he was still friendly and gave us excellent service. Love the place, just wish the restaurant was bigger."}
{"text":"Great Egyptian food! If you can stand the short wait then it's worth it.

The Cairo Classic is great but the star is the Lentil Soup... mind blowing, perfectly balanced.

For dessert try the Bassima"}
{"text":"These days, when I decide to visit new cafes I have a few prerequisites--that the food be good and fun to experiment with and that it not be too much of a hassle. This place has both--the amazing Pharaoh's Po' Boy and located about five minutes from my house at Sandford & Greenwood in Leslieville. There are a lot of cafes in this area, but I certainly appreciate them, & Maha's is one of the best."}
{"text":"The food is quite good - fresh, savoury, rich - but the service after two visits is so bad I'll never go back. Well meaning servers, but the design of the seating, plus the apparent inexperience of the management, means you can expect to wait for an hour for a table. The guy who looks like he might own the place makes coffee verrrrrry slowly while you scan the restaurant hopelessly for some better workflow. They'll seat a group of two in a table for four then you and your party of four wait and watch for 45 minutes for their food to come. Awkward. Once you get your table you're told that 1/3 of the menu is not available. And it's stressful in there; asking for water becomes an ordeal.  One server for 7-8 tables. No food is worth this kind of service."}
{"text":"The wait was 75 minutes long, after being told 45 minutes.  We got stuck in that awkward position of already having invested time so we just waited longer.  The food was forgettable.  I ordered the mind blowing chicken which is just chicken shawarma on a hamburger bun.  The bottom half of which was soggy and made it impossible to eat with your hands.  The service was greatly lacking.  We stared at our first meal for a few minutes because we didn't have cutlery or plates.  They informed us no bread came with our meals so we ordered extra bread, but bread came with every meal.  We got a pot of tea but were only given one cup, so we used the water cups instead after having asked a few times and got nothing.  I wouldn't come back to this place."}
{"text":"Really horrible service. Promised me a table in 45 min and wake to wait outside. So we did at coffee shop next door. Called 40 min later, he said another 35 min. I went over 30 min later and he said another 30 min. All that while a friend was waiting by the window and saw the tables empty 5-6 times over the period of time we were waiting. When I went in to ask about how much longer, he said sorry but he couldn't help. We had a baby and waiting for at least 20 min outside. All it would have taken is to say from the start that he can't help us and that he can't give us a table - shouldn't ask us to wait and promise a table. Really upsetting service for such a new place. We drove 45 min to try his place because it was recommended."}
{"text":"We started waiting around 10:45 and were seated by almost 12. The long lineup was fine and expected. But then the service was really slow and not really friendly! The table next to us placed their orders when we first got in, and we only got our drinks by the time they finished and left! Another table, who came in almost an hour later, was served before us! They finished their meals, when we got our last dish. We waited for an hour and half to start eating, which was after the 1 hour lineup!! We left Maha's at 2 and I think that's it. Once in my life here is more than enough! I hope this is not their normal speed of serving guests!:("}
{"text":"A homey restaurant/café with tasteful homemade food served in unique presentation. The décor is one of a kind - hip and chic details with the owners' personal touch. Warm services which makes you feel like a house guest rather than a customer."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time in February and came back today to try more of their dishes! Went around 9:30am on a Sunday for the first time and it was half an hour wait for a table for 2. I love eggs, so I had to order the shakshuka and enjoyed it! Today, we came at noon and it was an hour wait for a table for 2. Grab a honey cardamom latte and you wouldn't mind the line! My top two dishes were the Mind Blowing Chicken and Pharaoh's Po'Boy. Little chicken bits with tomato and tahini sauce turned out nice. Shrimp for the po'boy was also seasoned and battered perfectly. Space is tight, but it is a quaint spot that is good for a date or catch up with a small group of friends one lazy afternoon. Definitely recommend this place if you want to change up your typical weekend brunch!"}
{"text":"The excitment, anticipation and hungry only grew larger as my friend and i waited patiently for an hour in the rain to get a taste of what  Maha's offered. Unfortunately for us that feeling was short lived. As the line grew shorter and we finally stood first in line, i simply rest my foot on the door step when a young gentleman (who we later find out is the owner) points at me and barks \"stay there, dont come in?\". Quickly and in shock i took my foot off the step as if i have done the unforgivable. Both my friend and i were utterly stunned that anyone would speak to their customers or a human being in such a disrespectful way. As we sat down i pondered if i should say something or not. And i decided i would. As the young owner approached us i politely and respectfully mention to him that my intention was not to come in at that very moment i was simply resting my foot and did not appreciate his approach. With our surprise he rudely answers by saying \"so what do you want me to do\". Ummmmm a simple apology or acknowledgment would be sufficient!!!!! No he decides to explain to us that we interrupted him making lattes and called him over and simply wasted his time!!! I couldnt believe what he was saying!!! Moreover, he follows by saying if we dont like it we are more than welcome to leave!!! My friend who regularly goes there with her husband asks him \"You remember me dont you?\" At which he nods his head yes \"I always come here with my husband\" he looked at her and said \"SO!!!\" We couldnt believe how unprofessional, rude, offensive and blatantly disrespectful he was. He ends it in the same way he started it by removing our menus and asking us to leave!!!
In all my 30+ years i have never felt so humilated and uncomfortable like i did at Maha's that day."}
{"text":"Only come here if you have two hours to waste on your precious weekend. The place is small and they make you sit with strangers if you are a group of two. If you don't want to sit with strangers, they only have two tables for groups of two for which you have to wait for much longer. 

After waiting/standing for 45 minutes, I asked them for the bigger table with the comfortable chair for my pregnant wife. The table was empty at the time but they refused. Got the absolute worst spot, right next to the washroom door. 

The service was also pretty slow given a small place. Service came 5 minutes later. We ordered lattes that took them 15 minutes to make. 

We started with hummus and bread, which was the only thing we liked there. Hummus and bread were fresh. We ordered the cairo classic and the foole was ordinary. Nothing special and compared on par to some of the big Lebanese chains. Also order the chicken sandwich which was decent but didn't really blow me away. The bread/bun was good, the chicken was nothing special. The serving is also not that great given you are starving by the time you get served. 

If you are looking for a hearty meal that puts a smile on your face on that hard earned weekend, this is not the place. If you want to experience a different type of cuisine, come on a day other than Brunch because in my opinion it was not worth the wait."}
{"text":"My husband and I checked out Maha's on Greenwood before the Christmas holidays on a weekend for brunch. We went in around 1pm and the place was packed. We waited at the bar for a while before being seated at our table. 

Given the recent positive reviews they've received in BlogTO, we had high expectations for both the service and food. Unfortunately, we didn't feel either lived up to the hype of the article. This may be that they're just too busy and being new, haven't figured out how to staff their kitchen to handle so much business. I'm hopeful that they'll be able to sort it out and am willing to go back to try again. 

In terms of the food, I had the Egyptian scrambled eggs and my husband had the Date Grilled Cheese sandwich with a side of the curried potatoes. The food was good. The date grilled cheese didn't have much to it, but the scrambled eggs and potatoes were flavoured well, with spices not just salt. 

However, even with the food being alright, the service wasn't. We waited almost 25 minutes before we were served our food. I realize this is because each dish is made to order, but it's still a long time to wait. I think if staff helped to set expectations by explaining the food's made to order and will take a while, it might help to create a more positive reception. Instead, we found we had to work hard to make eye contact with our server to get more water and tea while we waited for our food and there was no explanation given or mention of how long it would take."}
{"text":"This place is DEFINITELY not worth the hype. I went on a Thursday morning around 11 am and it was pretty busy. I ordered the \"mind blowing\" chicken sandwich (that's what it's called) and my friend ordered the Cairo Classic. We waited for over an hour for our food and one of our meals came then another 10 minutes later... the second arrived. My friend also wanted to get a Turkish coffee but seeing as they cook all of their meals on one stove (4 people in the kitchen), the waiter said they couldn't make it. If you have one stove, you shouldn't have two pages of food options. The food itself was very mediocre.. the beans straight from a can and the sauce in the chicken sandwich had split and left a pool of oil at the bottom of the plate. I'm assuming there is a line up at this place only because it takes so long to get the food out."}
{"text":"Maha's is truly a delicious restaurant! As a fellow Egyptian, I can honestly say that every dish I tasted was very authentic! It's definitely better than my mom's (and mother in law- but don't tell her that!) 
We had the Cairo classic, mind blowing chicken sandwich and cumin fries. Soooo good!! 

One thing that I loved is how the falafel is made just like it is in Egypt. There are many places that sell falafel, but it's not nearly as authentic as it is at Maha's! 

I can't wait to return and enjoy everything they serve!!"}
{"text":"As others have said, if this review was based on food alone it would be a 5 star for sure. I've been here quite a few times, but won't go back again. 
Our last time there, after being told it was a 40 minute wait and then waiting more than an hour for a table, the servers did not seem to care at all that we were there. They seated two couples who we watched put their names down before us. We ordered coffees, which didn't come until halfway through our meal (and the server needed to be reminded about them) , and the Cairo classic and Egyptian felafel. Both dishes were delicious, but my husband's meal came out at least 10 minutes before mine. This is my hugest pet peeve in restaurants! It's so awkward when you have to choose between eating cold food and eating when the person across from you is looking longingly at your plate. 
Basically, it seems as though the servers and kitchen staff think that their food is so good that people should be lucky to even taste it. It's really good, but I'd recommend takeout. It's just not worth waiting for the crappy service."}
{"text":"Visited on a Friday at 10:30 am.  Waited for over a half-hour to be seated - by the time we received our food it was an hour since we arrived.  Worth it?  Food was outstanding.  We sat at their outdoor patio and service was very attentive.  Absolutely loved the brunch.  It's definitely a gem in the east end!!  Can't wait to try their other menu offerings."}
{"text":"After all the hype and the good things we heard we finally got the chance to go here... Went on a weekday for brunch... Still had to wait 45minutes for a seat.... Food was amazing and everything and more we had hoped for..... Got the egg fillalfeland the chicken sandwich and the cardamom latte.... Everything was amazing.. Will come back again"}
{"text":"Had high hopes. Unfortunately it was a disappointment. Don't believe the hype!  Long wait times totally not worth it. We waited about an hour for a table. As others stated, no information is given as to how long till the grub makes its appearance. 
There is maybe one server and he gives you no attention, like a bad boyfriend. 
They didn't have enough cups for tea so they only served us one cup!!  I offered to bring them some from my home collection from the middle east. An offer that received not even a smile.  
Food finally made its way to our tiny uncomfortable table. Anddddd sorry folks but was not good. It tasted bland, almost saltless. It was painfully dry, I suggest you bring your own tomatoes and add it to the omelette or something to make it juicy. 
I wanted so bad to have a great middle eastern restaurant in the area or in Toronto but maybe I'll have to open up my own one day. 
If you guys want some good middle eastern food don't be duped, just come over to my place for the best basterma and fool you've ever had."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. We had to wait an hour to get a seat at brunch, and would do it all over again! Cumin home fries, I'm still dreaming about them, wait staff was so accommodating, once we were seated service was fine even though they were slammed. Such a find!"}
{"text":"It was just two of us so we got a table immediately in the small place. Others waited for 2 to 3 hrs. This was a second attempt at getting a table here. First time gave them my number after being added to the wait list. they called almost 3 hrs later saying they had a table for 3, but we had gone elsewhere to eat thank god. 

Pros :
-great food, platter looks appealing, made from scratch according to staff
-some dips are fantastic, falafels were great 
-place looks really cute inside
-enjoyed the honey cardamon differ 

Cons:
- took over an hr for food to appear on the table
- it's made from scratch was the reason given, and with all due to respect to maha and the kitchen staff. I cook from scratch, my mother cooks from scratch. We can pull together delicious food in half an hr for two ppl AT LEAST. I think the whole point of going to a great restaurant is that pros are going to present amazing dishes in a reasonable time.
-it was so crowded since its so small, it was cold since they wouldn't close the door as people waited and talked and let the cold air in as it rained. Couldn't take any photos due to the hordes of people, and that was a real bummer since it was a special outing for me and guest. 
- they don't take reservations which is mind boggling since obviously this place should be reservation only so that you're guaranteed to get a table and they can plan on how to prepare food in a timely manner based on the seating schedule. 
-due to time delay with food delivery, as we got hungrier and saw one table at a time served and felt our interest piqued by another dish we didn't order, we wanted to order other stuff. We may even have wanted to order more while we ate. But we were kindly told  at these later times that we cannot order more food because it would take another hour after the our first order was delivered eventually. They literally dissuaded people from ordering food at their restaurant. Obviously I'm not returning again to wait this long so while I'm here I wanted to order more stuff but instead the kitchen was as per usual too behind on orders. 
-ordered the mind blowing chicken sandwich, and it was ok and not mind blowing. Needed more acid, but I enjoyed the herbs and veggies and bread. 
-soup had been been blended to have zero texture and was not super hot when we got it. 

Verdict: not worth it 
Food was good but not earth shattering, and based on principle a daytime non-alcohol serving restaurant is obliged to be able to prepare food on time. And let people order more food at staggered times. And have the foresight to let people know that they have such a long waiting list they shouldn't wait for a table for 3 hours because it won't work out. It was frustrating and not pleasant sitting there crammed in a small resto with people, feeling hungry and wondering why they couldn't even manage giving us an app. Toronto has a plethora of fantastic eats. Why waste your life in line here unless you've tried everything else? 5/10"}
{"text":"Honestly friggin amazing!!! Everything on the menu is superb- the staff is great. Would go every day if I could. They kill it"}
{"text":"Love the food here - it's delicious and different - worth 4 or a 5 stars

The service on the other hand?  Barely a 2.

I've been several times now and when it's busy - I can understand a bit of a wait for food or slower service. But when there are only three tables in the restaurant there should be no excuse for a 45 minute wait for a sandwich.  Made worse when I have a baby with me.  I had to finally get up and leave after my one year old had enough sitting in the highchair and we had played about 30 games of peek-a-boo.  I told the waitress I needed to take my sandwich to go and which point the STARTED to cook it.  

My mother stayed behind while I took my son home and there was no word of apology.  When she went to pay, the machine wasn't working and he said it would take a minute to get up and running again.  It took 15.  

Great neighborhood addition but they need to get on top of their service if they want to keep up with the demand."}
{"text":"Food = great quality. Lentil soup is A++ and definitely award-winning calibre. My brother had the Cardamom Honey Latte and was raving about it. I had the Classic, which tasted great, but there were a lot of fava beans in it. My absolute fave has to be a tie between the lentil soup and eggplant with pita. Super delicious!

Service= not so great. It really is a mom and pop restaurant with very little standing room for the many guests waiting. When we placed our order, my brother and I also placed some take-out orders at the same time. When it was time to get our bill, we were told we had to wait another 15 minutes to get our take-out. As well, the item on the menu that I wanted was not available as well as the date grilled cheese, which is very disappointing. 

Many others who came after us were clearly waiting at least an hour for a table. My opinion: not worth an hour wait (or even a half hour wait), but worth a visit during off hours (bonus: you also get to avoid the annoying hipsters and their annoying chit chat during off hours)."}
{"text":"Not sure if there is even a point in writing this as i don't think this place will ever change their model. They need to lock down some restaurant running basics, because its such a shame when the service is so lagging while the food is absolutely delicious. First of all, I second Laura who wrote a review previously regarding their extremely lacking of experience in table turning and seating, it all runs in a cycle and eventually you have a wait time above average popular place. We waited 1 hr and 40min but since the place is small and hyped, we get it and we asked for it. 

After beings seated though, our pot of tea with mint leaves came 30min after our order, and our food took almost another 40 min. As much as I want to relax and i do have the time to wait,  the hunger really gets to your head.  We went in March when its still a bit chilly out, heating in the place is not quite enough. So with the tenseness caused by the cold, hunger, anxiety hit and those yelp stars just lost their light one by one.  The food was delicious though, we had the platter to share, classic egyptian, mind blowing chicken sandwiches, and the scrambled eggs. All were quite amazing, flavourful and packed with fresh ingredients. I just wish they can be more accessible..."}
{"text":"Worth the wait! I had heard the hype about this restaurant more than a year ago, but didn't have a chance to come by until recently. I came here on a Saturday morning around 11am. The restaurant was already packed and there were at least 10 other groups ahead of us. I knew the restaurant was said to be small, but I didn't realize how small - there were less than 10 tables in total and not too much waiting space. Some people had to wait outside on a chilly winter's morning. The wait itself wasn't too bad as there is a lot going on in the restaurant. You can watch Maha cook, watch the bartender make drinks, or watch other tables dishes being served... 

We were finally seated after a little more than an hour. We could have been seated around 10 minutes earlier but we weren't in the mood to share a table with another group. Service was on the slower side (it looked like there were only two servers and one busboy) so it took a while to get our order in. However, our food and drinks arrived soon after. 

I had the hazelnut latte to drink, the cumin homefries to share, and the Cairo classic as my main. I highly recommend these three items because they were all so good!! I can't believe everything is made in house! The hazelnut latte was not too sweet (the rim of the glass is coated with nutella, the cumin fries were cooked just right, and everything in the Cairo classic meshed so well together. The Cairo classic comes with foole (tomatoes and onions with fava beans), sliced boiled egg, falafel, balady bread and house greens. I don't know the proper way of eating the Cairo classic but I decided to grab a little bit of everything and put it in the balady bread.  Everything was so good - it's so hard to pick what I liked the best, but I think the winner for me was the balady bread, which is like a multigrain pita. The only downside of my meal was that the server forgot to bring my house greens. I only realized this after I had finished my main, but after being reminded, they brought over my mixed greens with no questions asked. 

I also sampled the mahas mind blowing chicken sandwich and I was disappointed. The dish was a little to saucy for me and I thought there was too much tomato and too little chicken. I see the hype for the picture, but the taste doesn't live up to the hype. I also tried the honey cardamom latte but it wasn't my thing -- I am not a big fan of strong cardamom. I would still come back, I would just not order those menu items. I am looking forward to trying the basturma scramble next time I come!"}
{"text":"Tasty food. It filled my stomach really well. Took some time for us to get seated and to get food. However, it was really worth the wait. See you next time. :^)"}
{"text":"Went there on a Sunday for brunch. A very cozy little place that serves home cooked Egyptian delicacies. Extremely polite servers and good food too. But be prepared to wait atleast 45 mins to an hour to be seated and another 30-45 mins for the food to arrive, only reason I'd give this place 4 stars."}
{"text":"Nice little cozy corner restaurant.  I was looking forward to try their chicken sandwich and boy did they kept me looking forward.  Had to wait half an hour for a table, which was not their fault.  After being seated we had to wait 45 minute for the food to come.  If the restaurant was busy then I can understand, but it was around 3pm and most patrons had already left. The worst thing happened after the long wait, the chicken sandwich was waaaaaay too salty and citrus flavour destroyed all of my taste buds in three bites.  Presentation was amazing though.

2 stars for the latte and Egyptian falafel that almost saved the meal."}
{"text":"YUM! So nice to find a place that's doing something a little bit different. I had breakfast here and after sampling a few of my friends plates I can say everything was delicious.

They have a good assortment of teas and coffees from lattes with dates to Egyptian black tea. The food was incredible! Between us we covered the Classic (fava beans, bread, sliced egg, homemade feta, side salad), the falafel (with a scotch egg inside!) and the date grilled cheese and lentil soup. Everything was spiced and seasoned so well. Prices are definitely reasonable considering what you're getting (10-12$ a plate) and the portion sizes are quite good.

I am definitely going back here!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely a hidden gem!! I found this place through blogTO and was rated one of the best brunch places. I cannot agree any more! The food is a must try and a very different experience of Egyptian food! We went quite early around 10am and our wait time was about 30 minutes. Go earlier to avoid lineups because it got a lot busier as time went by!"}
{"text":"The quantities are perfect, and the food is delicious! The desert; \"Ome Ali\" is pretty good, and the tea is delicious!"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious, but the customer service is atrocious to say the least. I had a very disappointing experience. This was my second time at Maha's as the first experience left us craving for a second try. The first time we waited roughly 1.5 hrs to be seated (Sunday at 12PM), which was okay since there was a lot of hype. This time was worse as we arrive at 11:20 and were told that the wait would be 45, which is acceptable if it was a respectable and courteous estimate. We did not get seated until 12:50, which was double the estimate time. We had to wait outside while other were going in and out waiting. There's no good systematic control of waiting areas and waitlist. Several people went ahead of us even though our names were higher on the list. When we told the servers about it, there was no acknowledgement or apology.... The restaurant is quite cold inside as the door is constantly revolving, space is cramped, and expectation doesn't meet hype. The food is not worth the wait and I would not recommend this place as there are other brunch spots in the GTA that are much better in service, food and venue."}
{"text":"Heard this place is amazing..been seeing pictures all over the Internet and blog to has described it as top brunch place.  We decided to check it out today (Thursday at noon). First even though it's in the middle of nowhere and it's a weekday, there was a 45 minute line up for 3 of us to get a table.  

Loved the interior, very welcoming cozy trendy home set up. The restaurant itself is tiny, dont think it seats more than 30. Anyways the menu is clean and has enough choices without overwhelming you too much. The price point is also good. 

We ordered the bojo, bastura scrambled with side of foole and Egyptian felafel with lattes and hot chocolates on the side. Presentation was great with everything but in terms of taste I expected more.  Not to say that it was bad or bland but it was alright. Nothing I would crave and go back for.  The dishes are pretty unique and must try but nothing mouth watering..Ps I don't think they put sugar in our lattes cuz we had to put our own so not sure if that's the WY it goes or what.

Regardless I would give it a 3.5 star. It would have gotten a 4 but our food took super long to come, the wait was really long, the service wasn't the greatest and I think 4 star is too much n 3 is too little. 

Try it for yourself though:)"}
{"text":"Came here twice. I like the Turkish coffee, but my girlfriend was not a fan of the cardamum taste.

The Po boy shrimp sandwich was excellent

The mind blowing chicken sandwich was good, messy to eat. It was like a chicken shawarma pita wrap, except on a bun

The Cairo breakfast is worth trying. Foole is indeed a traditional breakfast item. 

The Egyptian falafel was interesting. The egg inside the falafel was a nice touch.

Would come back again."}
{"text":"Had to dock many stars because of how long this wait is - no cover outside, so while lined up you're waiting in the sun for at least 30 minutes, after we were seated we had another long wait before someone took our order - I watched 8 people who came in after us get served food before we even got our appetizer! Don't come here if you're diabetic, because your sugar will get way too low during the wait - will not be back"}
{"text":"Is this the best brunch spot in Toronto? Possibly. Is it the best brunch spot in the East End? Likely. 

Maha's is a fabulously tasty brunch, lunch or early dinner option - as long as you don't mind a bit of a wait. (But let's face it. Those lineups on a Wednesday morning really just go to show how good the food is).

The deliciously unique menu boasts standard breakfast fare with an Egyptian twist, extreme sandwiches, and plenty of both vegetarian and vegan options. 

My personal favourite is the Pharaohs Po'boy, shrimp perfectly deep fried in a delicate egg batter, then stuffed into fresh baldady bread. The vegetarian version (the Arnabeet) which subs cauliflower in for the shrimp, might be just as good. 

Having said that, for your first time - do the Cairo Classic. Trust me, come hungry, and enjoy."}
{"text":"SO GOOD! 
Came across this place online, and just HAD to try it!
We ordered the Maha's mind blowing chicken, Cairo Classic, Pharaoh's Po Boy, the Honey cardamom latte, and hazelnut latte. 
Everything was delicious and the place was beautifully decorated, very kind staff as well. 
Would return! :)"}
{"text":"Not worth the wait. We went on a Sunday morning for brunch. We were quoted a 30 minute wait and ended up waiting 50 minutes. The food was ok but the service was slow, the place was crammed with more people waiting for a table than those seated and the restaurant has an awkward layout. We had high hopes for this new place in the neighbourhood, but sadly think it's popularity will fizzle and unclear it will survive if they don't get their act together."}
{"text":"A wonderful trip to Egypt in upper Leslieville. Arrive at 8am sharp on weekends to avoid lines. Lines that most reviewers happily wait in--that should tell you something. Breakfasts are sublime. Yes service is a little slow. Think of it as old-world pace. No big deal."}
{"text":"Great place.  Would definitely be back.  The line up is long but worth it.  The chocolate balls and babaghanouj are life changing."}
{"text":"Come here if you'd like to feel racially profiled. The food is amazing but my friend and I had a really disappointing experience today when the server served us a dish \"compliments of the chef\" but was then told by the owner that he had to take back the dish and give it to table next to us where the only difference between tables seemed to be   our appearances.  I really loved this place but am so sad to never want to return after being so demeaned. Compliments of the customer :)"}
{"text":"I always read up on other reviews when there's a lot of hype surrounding a particular restaurant.  There were quite a few negative reviews describing big line ups, long waits (up to an hour), a complacent staff, exponentially long food prep time.  So when I decided to pay a visit to Maha's at 10:30am on a beautiful sunny Sunday morning in July, I was expecting a train wreck.

The complete opposite happened.  There was no line up, there were at least five open tables, the staff was attentive and prompt, and the food arrived within 15 minutes of our order.  So I have surmised that the negative reviews are due to either people having nothing better to do than complain and behave like entitled asses, or they're all compulsive liars, or both.

The food was excellent.  My friend and I ordered the Pharaoh's Po' Boy, Maha's Mind Blowing Chicken sandwich, a side of cumin home fries, and a Honey & Cardamon Latte.  The Po' Boy won the flavour race in this meal by a mile.  The chicken sandwich was basically an elaborate chicken shawarma (a bit dry, as shawarma tends to be), but fantastic presentation.  Cumin home fries were slightly above average, and the latte was quite nice for a flavourful morning coffee.

The only thing I would note is that the place isn't very big, and sound appears to travel, so if you're looking to have a discrete conversation, then save it for elsewhere.

I will likely return for another visit to try their actual breakfast dishes, but until then, I recommend ignoring the negative reviews and giving this place a chance."}
{"text":"Arrived to a line up at 12:30 on a Monday. 4 tables ahead of us, which added up to a 30 min wait. Destinations will do that. Very inviting once we got inside. We sat in the window.

Ordered pickled vegetables, falafel eggs, home fries. I had the Po Boy, and my companion had the chicken. The wait for food was a bit long - it was 20 min from order till the pickles arrived. Very happy once it did.

Pickles were sharp and diverse. The falafel eggs were delicate and lovely. Po Boy was great. Maybe more NOLA than Cairo, but that's ok. Delicious. Wasn't terribly impressed by the home fries. They were tasty, but not especially interesting.

Followed the meal with mint tea.

Good experience overall, though the wait may keep me from coming back."}
{"text":"J'adore. Le staff est génial et la nourriture est toujours délicieuse.
On est retournés souvent et notre expérience est toujours la même: excellente."}
{"text":"On my bucket list...to try cuisines from all around the world. Trust me me MAHA'S is one of the best place to try the taste of Egypt..! Not only their food but their cutlery and the decor of their store will take you all the way to Egypt for the amount of time you spend there. The MAHAS MIND BLOWING CHICKEN  is to die for. The food is cooked by a mother daughter duo( head chefs ) always consistent and to the point. Best place for your weekend brunch. !!"}
{"text":"Best food ever. I just hate the long line ups and there are very limited places to sit in here. Please expand and allow takeout on weekends"}
{"text":"Yummy and authentic.  What more do you want?  We loved the foule and the lentil soup.  They really should open a second larger location since they are so popular.  We went during the weekday for lunch and waited about 35 mins.  I'm not sure I would wait an hour or more like others have mentioned.  Looking forward to trying other menu items the next time."}
{"text":"Very friendly and welcoming! The food is amazing although it's a bit of a wait to get in, but totally worth it."}
{"text":"This place is such a gem. Try to get there early (or late) to avoid the rush, although you may find they're out of a few dishes by the end of the day. Made fresh, tastes fresh. Really enjoy the Egyptian mint tea, falafels, and dips."}
{"text":"I went to Maha's yesterday (it was a Tuesday) for lunch with a friend.  He said that he and his wife had tried to come a few times for weekend brunch but there was always a lineup and they were too hungry to wait.  Tuesday was no different and we would have had to wait 20 minutes for a table.  Luckily, it was an uncharacteristically warm November day and they still had one spot set up outside and it was available.

This is a small, warm and charming little restaurant that (obviously) fills up fast.  The staff were so accommodating.  As many Yelper's recommended, I had the Cairo classic.  It had a great variety of bread, beans (foole), sliced hard-boiled eggs, falafel and salad.  Everything was fresh and the meal was very filling.  Great value.  The icing on the cake for me was the latte.  It was perfect as far as coffee's go.  And thankfully it was served in a tall glass and not a big fat latte bowl.  

I'm looking forward to my next visit to explore the menu.  Highly recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"clearly one of the best restaurants of its kinda - every dish was extraordinarily flavourful and unique. 

best lentil soup I've ever had. lightly garnished with pickled onions... so incredible.

Honey cardamom latte... Po Boy... Overflowing chicken sandwich.... yes yes yes yes. a MUST go to spot for the intense flavour layers with each dish. GO!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my brunch here. 

The Pharaoh's Po' boy is stuffed with delicious baby shrimps. 

Mind blowing chicken is definitely mind blowing. Love the tomatoes onion and parsley better than the chicken itself :P

Also ordered a honey cardamom latte. Must-try!  

We got there around 9 and waited for 20 mins. It was so worth the wait. But I can see when the weather gets better,  20 mins is the minimum."}
{"text":"New brunch / lunch spot along the developing Gerrard East strip.  What's different about this place is that instead of the usual lunch / brunch fair it serves Egyptian food. The food is a different than anything else I've had in Toronto - but in a good way.  Not just your standard shawarma etc. but real authentic dishes. The food does sound a bit different at first, but its great!  So far it's been really busy on weekends. 

The interior looks good, and the owners are friendly. Also the coffee is awesome (free steamed milk with the coffee), and the deserts are baked in house and real tasty. I've started going there just for takeout coffee and treats as well."}
{"text":"THE SEATING TAKES FOREVER!!... Not only that but when you go in, you must write your name down on a list in order to reserve a seating, which both my bf and I were unaware of (which made it longer for us to get seats). However while you are waiting in line they do give you a menu, which really helped as we ordered immediately after we were seated. And I must say the food most definitely made up for the time it took to be seated. It has an extremely unique home-made taste to it. I would definitely recommend the home-made cumin fries, only because the dip that comes along with it (called Taamia) WHICH IS SOOOO EFFIN GOOD!"}
{"text":"Been there twice now. Food and drinks are amazing! Service is friendly. Absolute must!

I have had: 
1. Maha's Mind Blowing Chicken: $10. A little messy to eat but delicious.
2. Cumin Home Fries: $4. Very delicious
3. Hazelnut Latte: $3.95. Oh sooo good. The glass rim comes dipped in Nutella (?). Loved that. 

NOTE: this is a very popular place so the wait can be very long during peak hours: 
1. Went at 12 pm on Sunday, had to wait 1.5 hours for a table for 3
2. Went at 9:30 am on Friday, were seated immediately. 
So plan accordingly. 

Food is absolutely worth it."}
{"text":"we waited about 30 mins for a table mid day sunday, which we were ready for. the honey latte was super! the only quirk was that they were out of home fries as well as egyptian falafels. that was 2/3 of what our order was going to consist of. hopefully they increase their inventory to cater customers during the course of the entire day instead of just the early birds..

the chicken sandwich was a bit on the acidic side but is a must try, the poboy was our fav. absolutely delish"}
{"text":"Do not ever want to come here if you want to find hair in your food and receive horrible service!! I Wish I could yelp had negative stars. My boyfriend loves this place  it unfortunately we found hairs in two out of the three plates we ordered. 

We never received an apology, we got charged for the plates and when raising this issue they were extremely disrespectful and blamed us for their mistakes.  Worst experience of my life!!"}
{"text":"Great Egyptian / Middle Eastern Restaurant!  Food is yummy, portions are generous, service is good.  Usually there is a line-up but my wife and I went for lunch on a weekday and luckily there was no wait.  We had the cairo classic and the chicken sandwich - both were yummy and good portions.  Overall:  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"You probably don't need another review telling you how great this place is but honestly the queues are worth it here. 

You can taste the freshness of their ingredients and also the flavours of each dish is v complex and layered and perfectly balanced. I have only gone once bc it's out of my way but I would certainly make the trip back!"}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic! Everything you would want in Egyptian food and priced fairly with most dishes around $12 or less. Recommend getting the Cairo Classic (fava beans in tomatoes and onions, sliced boiled egg, a falafel, a dollop of tomato feta, charred balady bread and salata balady). The Betengan also delicious packed with roasted eggplant and bell peppers on a mini pita, drizzled with homemade garlic, vinegar sauce and homemade tehina. 

Other tasty sides were the charred balady bread, babaghanoug and cumin home fries (get this).

While the eats are great, the service is far from ideal. Inefficient! When you arrive, your name is written down on a list and you are provided an estimated time- ours was 1.5 hours around 1pm on a Saturday. What upset me was we were told to wait at the restaurant for the table as your name is called when it is ready. If you are not present, the table goes to the next person on the list. Kicker is if you are called and not present, you are still able to get a table even if you show up hours later. A simple text could solve this issue and losing a table if you don't show up within 10 minutes.

I would visit again however, it may be a little while and perhaps earlier in the morning on a weekend."}
{"text":"Shawarma falafel or Kebab grill will come to your mind about Arabic or Middle Eastern food. Arabic food is more than that.  Maha's present what is a real Egyptian breakfast is.  With a few bites you will be sitting in a neighborhood in Cairo. The restaurant is busy and that another factor will help you to feel a life even if you are there by yourself.  I ordered Cairo classic and enjoy it to the last bite. They took time to bring the food but I did not even feel it until I left.  I usually don't like to wait for long to get food but this is an exception.  I recommend to go and enjoy another taste of Arabic food."}
{"text":"I struggle writing a review for this place, because I am so frequently angered trying to eat here and vowed never to return again the last time they made us wait more than an hour to sit down. 

But the food is just so good. Everything you buy at this place has a home made, from scratch appeal. The food is exotic, fresh and flavorful. If you do come here, order the sampler platter which contains a whole circle of different spice rubs, oils and sauces you can dip your hot pita in. 

But be ready to wait, especially if you arrive on a weekend. The problem is the place is just too small. The kitchen is too small and there aren't enough tables. What space they do have is cramped. If you are prepared to wait, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The wait time was exceptionally long (just under 2 hours). The staff was very accommodating and quick once we received a table - unfortunately there was a very large party there for brunch that seemed to make everyone else's meals take much longer. They looked like they were having a great time but this place really can't accommodate 14+ people in the small space on a Sunday.

The food was decent. I had the Cairo breakfast. It wasn't as flavourful as I thought it would be and was a little bland. Unfortunately it wasn't worth the wait. The shakshuka ordered by my partner was not shakshuka at all - I think they gave us the wrong thing and didn't want to admit it which is another disappointment. 

The space was really cute and cozy. We were really looking forward to brunch here."}
{"text":"Maha's, you're soooo mmmmm, ahhhh - soooo good!!!  Loved every dish we ordered - so fresh, so perfectly cooked and seasoned, and so beautiful! Xx"}
{"text":"The food is awesome here. My dining companion and I tried the chicken sandwich, the tempura-batter cauliflower on a pita sandwich, and the cumin home fries. The home fries are tasty, but do not order these if you do not like cumin (and paprika). They are very heavily coated. The mayo they come with is delish.

My dining companion and I both expected to like the chicken sandwich more than the cauliflower pita, but the cauliflower blew us away. It was crispy and delicious. The chicken sandwich, as other reviewers have noted, is pretty much a chicken shawarma served on a bun rather than in a pita or in laffa. It's messy so you can't pick it up and the tomatoes on ours were a bit soggy so this was another reason I preferred the cauliflower. Not a fan of soggy tomatoes. 

The restaurant is teeny tiny and the music was super loud, but a server was nice enough to turn it down. The A/C wasn't working very effectively and it was a crazy hot day. The service also wasn't the quickest. Still, with all those caveats, I think the food and the awesome looking menu deserve 5 stars."}
{"text":"Toronto takes brunch seriously. Very seriously. I was a little surprised (shocked even) when I first moved here. But with that came the realization that the city is filled with delicious brunch spots! With all types of food. And Maha's is one of those little hidden gems. It's a very small place in Little India, in the East End. It serves Egyptian food - and specializes in brunch. 

I was lucky enough to try this place with a friend - and we discovered the best lentil soup in the city!! I still think about it - and crave it. It might just deserve its award/winning title Maha claims on its menu ;)

Other fave (and outstanding) menu items: Their Honey Cardamon Latte and their Super Chicken Sandwich (the name might be different - but the size is humongous!)

The one drawback about this place? Line-ups. Yes, it's tiny - so get there early, or be ready to wait in line!!"}
{"text":"Came back for the mind blowing chicken!! It wasn't as great as classic Cairo but the portion was huge and it was good. Also had the fries and it was alright. Nothing special. 

Service is always great and good comes out pretty fast."}
{"text":"Tasteful cuisine, creative naming and their specialty coffee. What more is to say  about this place? 
I advise you to come there as early as possible. It's an Egyptian place so you have to consider the culture as well and a family run business on top of that. Their story is actually quite interesting and dates back to early 2000's (you can check it out here: torontoism.com/toronto-restaurant-reviews/mahas-fine-egyptian-cuisine). I love when places are authentic, not the soulless places copying popular concepts just to ride the wave. Maha's is all that and you won't go wrong. 
The best way is to visit with friends or some company to talk during waiting period. I can assure you the food is worth it!"}
{"text":"Despite a 100-minute long waiting in line in a minus 2 degrees, the \"mind blowing chicken\" is truly mind blowing. Delicious in a unique way. The chicken is so flavorful. The soft buttery sweet bun is an awesome match. (drooling right now while reminiscing the feast.)

We ordered the Cairo Classic too. Nice comfy food. Just love the spice and gooey mushy textured food. 

Overall worth the wait and the money. friendly staff plus nice deco. But i would choose a weekday to come back. My mistake this time haha.

ps. new discovery around the neighborhood too
, lots of new cafes & bistros rising up. toronto is getting more and more colorful:)"}
{"text":"The food is beautiful and tasty; the wait is not.  To be fair, this is a small kitchen and the success of the business has probably made the wait far more than it should be. I'm also going on the assumption that everything is made to order and hence the wait time.

I had Maha's Mindblowing Chicken Sandwich. It was so good that I probably would have licked the plate if I were at home. My friend had the date grilled cheese and she also loved it. Hers was on what looked like a delicious challah type bread.  There was a generous proportion of cheese and dates in her sandwich. 

You know that the food is good when the level of conversation suddenly drops.

Will be back but am strategizing when the best time to go actually is. Perhaps for an afternoon snack?"}
{"text":"Im sorry Maha for this rating, I love ur food. Cairo classic, the appetizer platter for $17.  The lentil soup lunch, awesome chicken sandwich, shrimp po boy. All the food is just awesome.  But can no longer avoid the fact that the wait is ridiculous.  One hour for a table. Then forever for ur food.  45 minutes for two soups ?  No wonder a table takes so long to be available.  U need to speed it up.  Ur staff is so nice, the food is great but unless I'm hungry at 9am. (Which im not). The wait is a bit of a smack in the face.  I'm not the only one complaining about this.  All the low reviews are on the wait"}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing people!  Line ups are too much for me on the weekend., but as a chef I know that you will get the best service on a weekday so it's fine by me!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and environment. They could definitely do something about the reesrvation/waiting process. They give wait times that are never accurate and need to incorporate reservations for large groups."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! There's usually a wait to get in, but the brunch is totally worth it!  The atmosphere is super cute too.  If you can, try to visit during a weekday, the wait is much shorter. The food is great, I ordered the basturma scramble, it was wonderful. I'm a huge fan of basturma so when I saw it I knew this place was made for me...love at first bite. 
 
I don't really remember what my bf ordered, but he was happy with his meal. The coffee is superb too. We sat in the patio, it's small and quaint, and there was plenty of parking on the street. I only wish it was closer to my place."}
{"text":"Damn, that's good.

We've heard great things about Maha's from friends and it certainly lived up to expectations. Delicious Egyptian breakfast with beautifully seasoned fava beans. The cardamom honey latte was quite lovely. The date grilled cheese and home fries was awesome. The olives were unique as they were akin to an Indian spicy pickle with a strong lemon flavour. 

A few things to note. There are only 8 tables and it seats 24. Get there early to avoid waiting outside. 

Friendly service. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I didn't really know what to expect when my friend mentioned going out for an Egyptian brunch. But, hey, I love brunch of any kind, so why not go for it? I'd heard such good things, seen tantalizing photos; it was only a matter of time before we headed over.

Like others have mentioned, the line is long. We went around 1 PM on Thanksgiving Sunday and waited for about an hour before we were seated. However, unlike other places where I've waited upwards of that, this was DEFINITELY worth the wait. Between the four of us, we ordered:
Maha's Mind Blowing Chicken sanwich, the lentil soup, the Cairo Classic, Egyptial Falafel, and babaghanoug with mini pita. For drinks, we had the honey-cardamom lattes (SO EFFIN' GOOD!) All of the food was delicious and I'd be hard pressed to choose a favourite. The chicken sandwich was flavourful and overflowing - we ended up eating the leftovers with a fork after I scarfed down the sandwich itself. The soup is creamy and garnished with a few red onions. I got it as a side order, but could easily have had it as an entree: it's that good.

I'm looking forward to many more visits where I'll get to try out all the items on the menu. It's a smallish menu compared to some brunch/breakfast places, but that just exemplifies, to me, that Maha and her family take a curated approach to what they serve. 

Side note: I noticed more than a few Arabic-speaking people waiting with us. I'm not sure if they were of Egyptian descent specifically, but I take it as a good sign when people probably somewhat familiar with the food of the region decide to come to an 'ethnic' restaurant. It says a little something about authenticity, I'd hope!"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff! 

Try Duka and classic Egypt ! Don't forget to pair it with tea!

Their soup is amazing too. 

Slow service but the food deserve the wait !!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch. The wait time was about a half an hour. Seating is limited but is cozy. They have some outdoor seating as well for nice days. The service was superb. Servers were attentive and all smiles, radiant enough to get rid of the grogginess you're bringing in. 

Food: Really enjoyed the food here. We ordered the maha's mind blowing chicken sandwich, shakshuka, pharaoh's po boys, chef's appetizer platter and date grilled cheese. The food was phenomenal but my mind was actually blown by the chicken sandwich. It is so flavorful and to be honest I liked the bun on the bottom that soaked up all the sauces. The shakshuka was less tomato-y than expected and that isn't my preference, tasted good regardless. 

Drinks: For drinks we ordered the black tea with mint, hazelnut latte and honey cardamom latte. The hazelnut latte is so yummy and most people would probably love this. Honey cardamom latte is a bit of an acquired taste and hey, I've acquired it! 

Will be here again!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, love the middle eastern fusion feel of a hip cafe along with the traditional full of plants look. 

The food was delicious! Didn't get to try their cardamom latte. Next time! Great addition to the area, keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday at 12pm and were told the wait time was 45mins which I had expected. We finally got seated 45mins later and it took them 1hr to prepare the food. The food was good but nothing I would go back for. Service is good but too slow."}
{"text":"The only negative thing I can write about Maha's is that they aren't big enough. It's a casual cafe style with amazing prices and fresh tasty food. Lots of vegetarian options and some meat as well. Can't wait to go back and try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Maha's tops my favourite brunch places in Toronto. Everything from the food, service and overall ambience is top notch. Very affordable and the portions are huge. 

My favourite thing to order is the mind blowing chicken sandwich. Would also recommend ordering \"The Max\" and their assorted dips. 

The only con about this place is that the wait is pretty ridiculous. But if you're coming as a pair, you'll have a fair shot of getting seated in 30 minutes or so. They don't seem to take resos, but while you wait you can order from their cafe. I usually get the honey cardomon latte and refuse to try anything else because it is SO DAMN GOOD."}
{"text":"I would love to give this place five stars because the food is truly top notch. Fresh, delicious, and carefully prepared. Unfortunately the unapologetically slow service really brings down the whole experience. Over 30 minutes for coffee? Really? I think most working individuals expect to have a weekday lunch in an hour or less- don't go to Maha's if you have a schedule. Or a child. If you have time for a leisurely three hour affair and don't mind waiting half and hour plus for a beverage, you will not be disappointed. Maha's, please invest in some operational training/changes, you could be the best.  The food really is that good!"}
{"text":"Bottomline: Try it, but DON'T LINE UP

Everything was 4/5 including friendliness of service. But on a lazy fri afternoon with empty tables it took 20-30 minutes to even get coffee from a thermos!

It is not worth it. Yes it's good, but we have just as many great options in the city where you don't have to line up, including middle eastern-ish like Takht-e Tavoos (tastier than Maha's)

We had mind blowing chicken and one of their scrambled eggs with dates & other goodies. It took them close to an hr at least to get that to us, and yes there were empty tables around."}
{"text":"Amazing!  I had the Egyptian Falafel, and the falafel wrapped soft egg was to die for. The line ups can get long, so definitely try going during off-hours."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday morning a little after 11 and had to sit at the outdoor patio because the indoor seating was full. It was a really hot and humid day but thank goodness for the 2 fans in the outdoor patio area which made the seating arrangement bearable. 

We ordered the following between the 2 of us

- Cairo Classic
- Mind Blowing Chicken Sandwich
- Cumin Fries
- Cardamom Latte

 Food was really tasty and flavourful. Portion size is huge. I really like the mind blowing chicken and the cumin fries. My partner thought the cumin fries were too salty but liked the mind blowing chicken sandwich as well. The Cairo Classic was tasty but not as good as the sandwich. 

Service was friendly but very slow. Our food took over 40 mins to arrive from the time we ordered. Also, it's not first in, first out as other customers who ordered after us got their food before we did. 

Overall, we enjoyed our time here as the food and service were good enough to make up for the slow service."}
{"text":"there was an hour and a half wait to get seated; we got there a little after 12:30pm. 

We killed time by walking around outside - on a summer day it would be a lot nicer than a cold spring day. 

We decided to order a whole bunch of different things to share. 

The falaffal with the egg was by far the best dish we ordered. The lentil soup was interesting- we shared a small one. No complaints about it but it reminded me of the taste of goat curry. 

The chicken sandwich was nothing special. It tastes like regular chicken on the rocks. 

The beet salad was just chopped beets... wasn't worth the price. 

Happy with the service we got! I'd return here again eventually!"}
{"text":"Waited 30 minutes outside on a freezing December Saturday but I have to say I understand the hype over this place. I had the honey cardamom latte- super smooth flavour, not a strong enough coffee but that's just me, the cardamom taste itself is delicious though. I know everyone gets the Cairo breakfast here but I had the basturma scramble which I really recommend, it definitely satisfies the savoury cravings and balances out the sweetness of the cardamom latte. The decor is just adorable too, and the service is super friendly. Overall a must-do in Toronto! :)"}
{"text":"They have long wait lines and a small window if you are planning to head there for dinner. This is more of a family run brunch place so make sure to call ahead to see if they are open as at times they have closed earlier than the posted times. The food is excellent, tasty and is very flavourful. I've tried the mind blowing chicken with cumin potatoes - both amazing! The food is 5/5 and I would have rated the place 5 stars if it wasn't for the long waits and unpredictable nature of their operating hours."}
{"text":"Have to dock a star because of the ridiculous wait to get in and get some food. Don't come hungry! Come when you're going to be hungry in ~2hours, put your name down. And then you'll get called when you're hungry. 

Don't have time to wait? I would HIGHLY recommend getting their hot drinks to go. SO good!!! Latte and hazelnut latte are tried and tested.

We ordered the lentil soup to start. Though the quantity was small I would get it again. Everything we ordered was made to perfection. I can't recommend this place enough. Staff is awesome, food is awesome, drinks are awesome, price is worth it, quantity of the food is good."}
{"text":"Super duper yum! But there will be a line, even at one o'clock on a Monday. 

We started with a side of falafel and a delicious coffee that was obviously made with care. The falafel was one of the best I've ever had, crisp and light, with a delicious tahini sauce and chili oh man, so so good. We also had the artichoke salad which was not quite what we expected, with quarters of preserved artichoke in a delicious dressing, but we loved it. 

I had the Mind Blowing Chicken without the bun and it was amazing. So savoury and rich, the flavours melded together like sweet, spicy magic, yup, magic. The diced fresh tomato was an excellent touch. It was also way more food than I could ever have eaten in one sitting. My husband had the Pharoh's Po Boy and loved it. We'll definitely be back if we can figure out a time that won't be too cray busy."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, delicious flavours, friendly staff. The place is small and the wait for a table and food is often long on the weekends, but the food is so good that I still give it five stars. You must try the following:
Honey cardamom latte;
Egyptian falafel;
Date toasted cheese with lentil soup;
Cairo classic;
I have never even got to the sandwiches side of the menu because everything else is just so good."}
{"text":"DELISH!!!
Just went for brunch. Excellent coffee. Food is amazing with really unique flavours and salads and sandwiches. FANTASTIC. A bit of a wait to get in on a Sunday at 1130...about 30min but well worth it. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We waited 45 min in -16 weather but it was completely worth it. They served samples of the warm lentil soup to keep us warm while waiting, and the staff were super friendly and very competent. You can tell they take pride in their work.

We ordered the app platter, I highly recommend if you like dipping pita in an assortment of hummuses, babaganoush, and several others to add... then we shared the chicken sandwich, which reminds me of halal guys (56th and 6th in NYC) but ON CRACK. Both were delicious. Ask for the house made hot sauce- it is $10 to buy a small jar, and I took one home. 

The seating is very limited, prepare to share tables. But the vibe is so authentic, the tiny resto covered with art, photos and memorabilia.

The americano was also on point. Def can't miss this place, it's a rare gem to be found in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Just the best! Not fried eggs and toast, but a sumptuous Egyptian spread. Tight on seating so get there early! It's well worth it. Top features:

1. Poached eggs in falafel balls. Nothing like it
2. Bottles of water crammed full of lemon and mint
3. The FOOLE! You'll want to buy a batch to bring home too
4. Amazing Turkish coffee and unique lattes
5. Charming and wonderful staff"}
{"text":"Their coffee is AMAZING!

Came here sun morning around 9:30, there wasn't a line yet.  So glad for that, as this was our 2nd time coming here, the first time, we came on a sunday around noon, and the line up was just ridiculous... so we left.  Anywho, I got the honey cardamom latte and wow, was it amazing!!  Every sip was rich, smooth and delicious.  I quit coffee a few years ago, (meaning I don't drink coffee regularly anymore.. at most, 2 cups per month) but I couldn't resist how amazing their coffee is!  I also got the mind blowing chicken sandwich... it was okay.... and tried the basturma scramble... also .. meh... To me, I wouldn't come back for the food, but I'd definitely come back for the coffee.  

As everyone indicated, service was slow, but was generally good.  It's a nicely run mom and pops place.  I can't wait to come back just to try all their different coffees :\"}
{"text":"Definitely worth the wait.

We came at 12:15pm for brunch on a Sunday and waited 1 hour for a table for 2. We had been wanting to try this place for some time now and it did not disappoint.

The restaurant is super quaint with limited seating but super cozy. There is a couch seating near the front of the restaurant by the window which looked super cute. 

Maha was working at the kitchen and it was easy to spot her. The entire staff was very friendly and acknowledged the long wait times. Service was great and prompt.

We ordered:

- Shrimp Po Boy - must get. It was so flavourful and not at all too oily. The mayo/sauce they used was the perfect sauce to balance out the deep fried shrimp. We wanted another one after!
- Mind-Blowing Chicken - so good! very flavourful with all the herbs used to mix the chicken! I definitely enjoyed this. The bun was lightly toasted and it was a delicious mess cause Maha gave so much chicken!
- Cairo Classic - as we aren't used to eating beans and some of the more traditional flavours, we did enjoy this as it was different from our normal choices. The foole was tasty but again, we probably just aren't used to the flavours.

The lattes were made with care as we watched at the front while we waited for our spot so we did not hesitate to try the cappuccino and the honey cardamom latte. Thoroughly enjoyed both although they could have been a little hotter.

All in all, a solid brunch place and definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"One of the best meals I have ever had. Their lentil soup was the best item off of menu as well as potatoes. We also got mind blowing chicken burger which was pretty good. The only thing negative I'd say about the chicken burger is that it had too much sauce and very little chicken."}
{"text":"What kind of a first world restaurant doesn't have ac or even fans? 

Forget the food and the fact that it takes an hour for an order to come out. But think about the fact that you're bringing people into your restaurant and charging $15 for a dish that you serve in a restaurant that has absolutely no air flow inside. Complete disregard for customers comfort in my opinion means you deserve the worst rating .

It's 40 degrees outside and people are sweating and fanning themselves while waiting an hour for their food to come out. 

Absolutely ridiculous. I don't care how good the food is. I can find good food at other restaurants too without suffering. But to sit inside a oven for an hour and then get a bill that's steep makes no sense.

NOT WORTH IT"}
{"text":"After years of hearing about Maha's and the \"hype\" behind her restaurant, I was finally lucky to make it down on Sunday Feb 11th, 2018.

I arrived around 10:30 am, and thanks to a snow storm, there wasn't a line up and I was seated within 5 mins - excellent start as there is usually a minimum of 1-2 hour wait time from what I heard/read. Beautiful cozy place with a nice authentic decor which brought back lots of childhood memories. 

I was excited to finally try an authentic classic Egyptian \"fool\" dish similar to the ones I used to have back home. I went ahead and ordered the \"Cairo Classic\" dish that consisted of fool (fava beans), 1 falafel, egyptian bread and a sliced egg. Without being too harsh, there was nothing special about it at all. I kept tasting it and trying to convince myself to like it because of everything I heard about this place but sadly, it tasted like the Mexican black beans you find in Chipotle spread on a plate with a sliced egg on top. No originaltly whatsoever - tasteless! Being a Middle Eastern myself, I was hoping for at least a little authentic touch...as simple as putting a small jar of olive oil or pickles on the side for a example, but no! Anything extra you had to ask and/or pay for. 

Moving on to the second meal, my friend took  a different direction completely and ordered the \"Maya's Mind Blowing Chicken\" which had nothing to do with middle eastern food nor did it have to do with any culture really...we just got it because we were told by friends and the reviews online that it is a must try... It was one of the worst dishes I have ever had in a very long time! It was basically pieces of chicken mixed with tomatoes and onions with extra onions and more onions. Oh, and tahini sauce on top just because. It was a disaster. The bun had nothing to do with the dish and I'm still unsure of why an Egyptian restaurant would carry buns in their kitchen! I felt insulted by this dish as you probably can tell lol

I don't usually leave negative reviews but I had to for this one since I went with really high expectations, as I should have, because of the overwhelming reviews and positive feedback I heard about this place.

So disappointing."}
{"text":"The Po'Boy was amazing. Too bad it took more then an hour from order to service."}
{"text":"- nice neighbourhood feel to the restaurant.
- pharaoh po boy was good. definitely hit it with some lime juice to brighten up the flavour.
- get the dookah (spelling?). it's a nice sesame based grounded spice rub that you take their bread and dip in conjunction with olive oil. very tasty.
- place seats about 25 inside, so if there is a line, be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Such good food! My husband got the mind blowing chicken and I got the arnabeet (the veggie version of their po boy) and both were excellent. The price point is also great. We knew there would be a wait, so we got there just after 11 and got a table close to noon. Their estimated wait time was bang on (45 minutes to an hour) so no complaints there, the only thing is that they won't text you when your table is ready so you really have to hang out by the restaurant while you wait. This would suck in the winter, and in the summer on a really hot day (as it was when we went) it can be a bit draining, hence only 4 stars...but 5 stars for the food!"}
{"text":"I'm a big foodie and in all my 27 years in Toronto this was probably the most unprofessional restaurant. 

Pros:
- Food was average 

Cons:
-Waited 15 minuets to have our order taken 
- Water was never refilled 
- My food came 15 minutes before my girlfriends so she had to watch me eat until hers arrived (extremely unprofessional) 
- Our appetizer (fries) arrived LAST. This was after our main courses. 
- Small portions

I don't know why people even line up for this place. The food is average and the Danforth in very close where you could actually find quality food. I would never step food in this poor excuse for a restaurant again."}
{"text":"For the amount of time you'll be waiting, not worth it. I've never spent so much time waiting at a restaurant when it wasn't busy. Arrived right at 8:00 when they opened and there were 4 groups already there and got a table for 2 right away. Once we were ready to order it took about 10 minutes to actually get one one to take our order.

Two tables of 2 near us had their orders taken just before us and they had finished their meals by the time ours arrived - it was frustrating. The food was filling and tasted pretty good but not extraordinary. The pros are the interesting decoration and peculiar pieces of art throughout the space. The staff are friendly but had undertones of avoiding you. 

I probably wouldn't come back. Save your time and just look at the pictures."}
{"text":"I love the idea of this place. This is a family run restaurant with Egyptian style cooking. I find every time I come here, I am always told the wait is 40min and end up waiting at least 90min. The service can be really slow. For my latest visit, I went with a friend and after waiting 2 hours, we were finally seated and I had wanted to order something to go for later. The waitress flat out refused because they apparently don't allow people to order take out because the kitchen was busy. I then said fine, I will order a second dish to which she responded \"I know what you're doing so no\"....I couldn't believe it! After waiting so long, I was really disappointed with the service. They were also out of two dishes and couldn't make the date rose latte."}
{"text":"Incredible food! Flavorful and satisfying! The portion sizes are incredible too! We ordered the Pharoah's Pho Boy, Maha's mind blowing chicken and Basturma scramble. The first two were undoubtedly incredibly flavourful-  the Pho Boy had fried shrimp in a herb batter with a mildly tangy sauce a top- delicious! And Mahas mind blowing chicken was indeed mind blowing! Too bad they don't offer this in their take out menu :(
The Basturma scramble in comparison fell quite short. Though it looked quote good, it lacked flavor and was very bland. 
I also ordered the honey- cardamom latte- AMAZING!!! I think they add crushed cardamom, which just adds so much yumminess to the latte! Absoltely Loved it!!
 
The line ups are about an hour but the food is definitely worth the wait. The staff is incredibly sweet and attentive. Though the place is small (max capacity 24 people), you don't feel rushed.
Overall a good experience! Can't wait to go back and try  more items on their menu"}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday morning and it was busy. My boyfriend and i waited for more than 30 minutes for our order. I had the Shakushuka and it was a bit bland for my taste. But the overall experience was great. Love the indoor decor!"}
{"text":"Went to Maha's expecting to be blown away by all the hype it's generating. Having ordered the most popular breakfast items on the menu as well as lattes and rice pudding for dessert, we agreed that it was atleast a solid B. The food was freshly prepared but lacked distinct flavours. Not bad if you're looking for a change from the regular brunch items, but I'd still do paramount over this next time I'm looking to change up the brunch game. I did notice that they keep muffins and sweets uncovered and right at the cash register with 10+ people standing around in the small waiting area, and even talking over the food items (to the staff behind the counter)- don't think that's very hygienic."}
{"text":"I have visited this spot twice now in order to get a better feel for the food served here. Both times it didn't disappoint.
First visit was on a weekday and bit early so there was no wait. The second visit was on a weekend and the place was packed with a 45 min wait to get a table. Never mind on to the food. I tried the following items
Po Boy Sandwich. Fried well with a nice batter. Nice crunch and not over cooked. 
Bastruma Scramble. I like Baturma once in a while and their version packs a taste punch which can be lacking sometimes from the store bought version of this cured meat. 
The chicken sandwich. I just tasted this and it was again a flavor punch. Might try it out on the next visit. 
I would like to mention the hummus side as being exceptional. Yes a simple dish this one is done very well. I ordered the balady bread which was in harmony with this side. 
Cumin home fries are OK.
When one factors in the price value proposition I would say a solid 4 star."}
{"text":"I've always had the shrimp poboy here, shrimp is battered and quite big and juicy, and they don't skimp on the shrimp either. The pita is nice and warm and the sauce they use puts it all together nicely. I've only ever had this here (have been here three times though) but I will definitely come back to try the other things at some point. They're also pretty good about letting us stay and get work done, but it was a weekday maybe when they weren't as busy. 

Oh, and super friendly family owned place."}
{"text":"Honey Cardamon Latte is their signature drink,  and delicious.  I don't drink flavoured anything except when I come to Maha's 

Staff are attentive and friendly.  Food is all made to order & fresh (they don't have a freezer) so it may take a little longer for you to get your food, but once you do it's worth the wait.  I've ordered just about everything on the varied menu: shrimp, chicken, falafel and it's ALL good. The prices are so reasonable.

Be prepared for line-ups as this place is busy"}
{"text":"Ordered the Po Boy with a side of Cumin fries. Both were delicious, and the Po Boy came with a generous amount of shrimp. Very well priced, and there is plenty of free street parking in the area.

The service was great, but my guess is that the wait for food might be slightly longer than average depending on how busy the place gets."}
{"text":"Visiting from N.Y.,  loved this place! The chai tea with orange peels and sliced apple is delicious and the pharoah po boy.. was like wow. Mark was a great host as well.. Thanks so much guys I plan to visit again!"}
{"text":"Like others have wrote, if this was based solely on food at least a 4 star, this is my third time but the wait time was absolutely ridiculous that I will never come here again.  

Got there at 12, it was the day after boxing day so I expected longer wait times.  Initially told it would be around 1 hour and a bit, but we didn't get seated until 3pm!!!.  By the time you get served, was exhausted and hangry.  They don't take your phone numbers for the waitlist, there's barely anyplace to stand and wait inside and its freezing outside, also we came in a group of 3 but groups of 2 that came much after us got seated first!!! (we wouldnt have mind squeezing in another chair).   If we had known it would take 3 hours we definitely would have left.  Its simply not worth it.  

What's worse, people languish long after eating when the entrance is jam packed with people waiting.  Understandably one wants to enjoy their meal and relax, but in this situation where its tiny and wait times are that long, there should be a better way to translate to customers that people are waiting, or rather, service needs to limit their waitlist much sooner.  Also, I don't understand why they don't take phone numbers, we went to cafe to wait, but were afraid to lose our spot so went back to the restaurant only to have another 1.5hrs standing in the entrance.  

The platter was sold out, a disappointment. Ordered cheese sandwich, it was tasty."}
{"text":"I could not wait to try Maha's; I knew there would be a crazy line-up so taking that into consideration, we still decided to go on a Saturday afternoon and as expected, there was an hour and a half wait. The cardamom lattes held us over and made the time go quicker. Must try!

The food was great. The falafels were my favorite as they had a distinct aromatic spice not usually found in traditional falafels. The potatoes were delicious. Instead of trying the chicken sandwich everyone raves about, I went with the \"award winning lentil soup\" because I'm a soup fiend. Unfortunately, I didn't find that the soup tasted very homemade and was salty.

I would still come back here in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"I went on a Saturday morning for brunch on a rainy day and there was already a long line. We ended up waiting for an hour before we got seated. Nice interior and friendly staff. I got the Basturma Scramble. It was good but I found it to be a bit too salty for my taste. The salad and bread were super tasty but my friend and I really wanted something to dip the bread into so, we ordered a separate dip and it was a fantastic addition to the meal."}
{"text":"Have attempted to go to this restaurant on the weekend a few times with no success as the wait is always well over an hour. Came back on a Monday and had an amazing meal that was well worth the wait. To start, the service was very good and the restaurant itself is really cozy and welcoming. 

We ordered the Cairo Classic, the Basturma Scramble, a side of garlic tomatoes, and cappuccinos.  Everything was amazing and the flavours were delicious. If you like spicy food, be sure to ask for the house made hot sauce which added a kick to the meal. Loved everything about this restaurant - A really welcome change to the typical Toronto brunches in this city and I will most definitely be going back to try more dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"Really lovely place, looks family run.
Don't come here for anything quick. Expect to take your time and relax.
Nice affordable meals.
I'd come back!"}
{"text":"I love this place and come here often.  As previous reviewers have mentioned you will wait in line no matter what time you come.  It's a family run shop that has only so much space and so many people who can cook this food.  I've tried a lot of items on the menu but now consistently stick with the sunny eggs and foole and the Egyptian falafel.  The chicken sandwich is good but agree with previous reviewers that it's not mind blowing and the basturma is quite tasty also.  I also really like the baladi which is quite authentic and the beleela which is basically oatmeal for people who love dessert.  I grew up eating Egyptian food so it's so nice to be able to get some of these classics from a local restaurant.  I love the tea with mint and others that I've been with really have enjoyed the various latte coffees.  The family that runs this place is super friendly.  We asked once how they get the egg in the falafel but were given a \"how do you get the caramel in the caramilk type of response\" ;) Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is terrific. 
I initially went there to take out a few items which I had seen pictures of on Yelp, but when I arrived I learned that they had a separate limited [vegetarian only] menu for take out. So I decided to sit and stay so I could treat myself to the full menu...
Their Foule is amazing and very authentic, and it's one of the few places where I know to find foule in this city. 
I also tried the mind blowing chicken sandwich which was absolutely delicious and complex. The perfect mixture of ingredients complimented with a healthy portion of tahini and garlic sauce. 
The last thing I pigged out on was the Egyptian eggs which are basically falafel coated eggs, and they were really good too. Served with delicious garlic mayo which I just can't get enough of. Lucky they are not conservative with their sauces.
I highly recommend this place. I will be back to try more menu items."}
{"text":"I'd been hearing so many good things about this place even before it blew up and I finally got a chance to go on a Tuesday afternoon. I was expecting a wait, so that didn't come as a surprise. My boyfriend and I waited for about 20 minutes before we were seated, and we ordered the Falafel as the appetizer, the Cairo Classic, and Maha's Mind Blowing Chicken. I also ordered a Cortado as my drink. 

We could tell it was going to take a while for the food to come because the people beside us and in front of us were seated way before us and still hadn't received their food (TIP: Do not come to this place if you are really really hungry). 

I was expecting at least my cortado to come, but that didn't come. Finally, after about another 20 minutes, our food came (Chicken & Cairo Classic), however when my boyfriend asked about the falafel, the waitress admitted she forgot about it and went back to notify the kitchen...This was disappointing since we wanted to start off with the falafels. 

The food itself was good. I really liked the chicken, I can't even begin to think about how many calories that thing must have had but it tasted like a shawarma chicken would, but much more delicious. The Cairo Classic was pretty good as well, but nothing special. When the falafels finally arrived, they were truly fantastic as the waitress had recommended.

At this point, I was still waiting for my cortado...so I asked the waitress again and she said she had forgotten once again....and that she will bring it. Ten minutes later, it still wasn't there and we had finished our food. So I asked if I can just have the cortado to go, the guy who made the cortado came up to me with the cortado in a regular cup and said \"I had just finished making it but I guess I'll put it in a cup for you to go now\" as if it was the hardest thing to do and such an inconvenience for him....

All in all, the service here absolutely sucks...I understand it's a small place and there aren't too many people working in the kitchen, but come on....

If you want to go, go on a weekday, and earlier in the day. Weekends are insane here...I think we will probably go back, but maybe when the hype dies down and it gets less busy. The wait is not worth the service you get. The only reason I'm giving this place 3 stars is because of the food and the decor (very cute place). Get some quicker and more attentive servers and this place would be 5 star for sure."}
{"text":"Food was really great!!! This is what good home cooked food should taste like. Very moms and pops feel and pricing is reasonable. I would recommend the Lentil Soup and the Sunny Eggs and Foule. 

The wait was obnoxiously long though and the servers were nice but they really didn't know how to handle the situation. We were seated immediately but it took 1.5hr for our food!! So it's super hard to give it a better rating."}
{"text":"Had an incredible time at Maha's during their weekend brunch! The food was very reasonably priced and absolutely delicious! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Incredible food, incredible atmosphere! 
VERY VERY well priced, and so so so delicious! walk out full and happy! We ordered everything on the breakfast menu and were not disappointed by a single thing! It's been months and I'm still thinking about it! 5 people walked out with a total bill of $65!! Best brunch I've had in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Never disappoints! Their shrimp po boy, the roasted cauliflower inside pita, their date grilled cheese...all perfection! Their coffees are strong and delicious, although they take quite a while to prepare. Friendly service and feels good to know that it's truly a family business. Go on weekdays since it's hours of waiting on a weekday! It's my go to when my parents are in town or if a friend wants something different for brunch"}
{"text":"We came on Friday around 3-4pm and during this time it was empty and we were seated right away.

Once we were seated, the server informed us that the chicken sandwich was sold out for the day. I was quite disappointed that it was sold out, after having everyone rave about it. 
I opted for the shakshuka and my friend ordered the pharoah po boy. 
The shakshuka was good portion size, served with pita and a side salad. The shakshuka was more egg than tomato. It has more of a scrambled eggs texture but even so, it was very flavourful. 
The pharoach po boy was small in portion but was loaded with flavour and shrimps. 

The place is small but cozy. I noticed there were personal memories from the owner's travels hanging on the wall and their fridge and it gives off a homey feel to it.
This is a good spot for Egyptian food and I would come earlier next time to try their sandwich!"}
{"text":"The Cumin fries are a nice surprise; and the cardamon coffee is expensive but interesting. 
It takes forever to get here and there's a constant line up, I don't think I will come back unless I can get my Cairo Classic in 20 minutes."}
{"text":"We came here on a Thursday afternoon around 1 pm, and there was still a line up! We waited 20-30 minutes which was okay, but the place is very small so make sure you're ready to wait! 

We ordered the Maha's mind blowing chicken, the pharaoh's po boy and a side of balady bread with babaghanoug. The chicken was tasty with lots of onion and tomatoes. We really enjoyed the po boys - the shrimp were deep fried to perfection with lovely tahina and mayo sauce. We loved the balady bread and babaghanoug so much, we ordered another one after our meal with the hummus! They forgot about our hummus order, and compensated us with 2 mini honey-slathered desserts. Great way to end our meal. 

All the sauces are made in house and are fantastic. Great flavours at this place. I would recommend it if you're willing to wait in the line!"}
{"text":"I'll be honest that I've never heard of this place.  I took the 506 across from Yonge and I knew it was going to be a bit of a ride along Carlton and Gerrard to get to Greenwood.  When I arrived at Greenwood and crossed the street I noticed there was a bit of a line up.  I thought to myself was this line up for Maha?  It was about 1:20pm in the afternoon on a Tuesday and there was a line of about 20 people in front of me.  For the 10 or so minutes I was there the line did not move at all.  I was meeting a friend and I was texting saying that there was going to be a bit of a wait.

I was in line pretty far away from the storefront so I couldn't even see how busy it was inside.  I asked the person in front of me to confirm if this was the line for Maha and she had said yes.  I said wow this was quite the busy place.  She said that they were featured on TV and blogs so I could see how this place would be packed.  That happens in the city sometimes where a place gets popular and then it's harder to get into the place at least for a while and sometimes that popularity can last.  

A server came out to the line looking for parties of 2.  The person in front of me who I had spoken to was a party of two so she moved right on in to get a table while everybody else in line was 3 or more it seemed.  Since I was a party of 2 I was hoping she'd return asking for another party of 2.  She did in fact come out and I was able to get a table outside on the patio for 2 before my friend arrived so it worked out.  It seemed rather lucky there were only 2 of us otherwise who knows how long we would have had to have waited to be able to get a table.  This place seems so popular that people are willing to wait in line mind you this around 1:30 on a weekday and there's a line.

When my friend arrived it didn't take us long to decide what to get.  We went with the Cairo Classic which is a plate of seasoned fava beans, tomato feta, sliced boiled eggs and balady bread with a single falafel ball.  For our other dish we wanted to try the mind blowing chicken which is a plate of salad with tomatoes, onions and parsley mixed with the chicken drizzled with mayo and tahini with more bread on the side.  To drink we ordered the black tea with mint.

We were catching up because we hadn't seen each other in about a year and a half and while the weather was basically perfect outside it seemed that the meals were taking quite some time to come.  It was quite busy the place but I rarely eat this late in the afternoon for lunch (now after 2pm).  The tea came and it had quite the presentation with tiny cups with mint coming out of the top of the pot.  When the food finally came we were quite famished.  I have to say the wait to get the food was only offset by the fact that we had pretty much been seated quite quickly and didn't have to wait too long in line luckily.  

The classic came out first and we had started on that.  The chicken shortly followed.  We were making space on the table the best we could considering we were sharing both dishes.  The servings are decently sized and the taste was good.  I especially liked the classic because the beans although spiced were not overwhelming.  The falafel was good as was everything that made up the classic plate and I especially liked the texture of the balady.  The chicken and salad while good didn't really blow my mind.  I'm not sure if the anticipation or the wait made it more of a higher expectation but overall for both dishes and the experience I can't say if I had to wait longer that it would have been worth it.  

The wait for the plates was quite long to the point I was getting worried.  We had some places we wanted to go that day and we had to skip one because time didn't really permit.  From being seated (around 1:30pm) to the time we ended up paying and leaving it was about 3:15pm.  That's almost 2 hours for us at the table ordering, waiting, and eating.  While the food was enjoyable the chicken salad dish wasn't spectacular (it didn't necessarily blow my mind) the wait seemed much longer than expected.  If it was this busy on a Tuesday afternoon and it was this long for the food to normally be served I can't say it was really worth it."}
{"text":"I am not sure why so many people complain about the wait. It's a small restaurant that can only have 24 people, so what did you expect?

Regardless, I think this restaurant is worth the wait. If you want to skip the huge lineups, come during off peak times or during snow storms (which we did and we waited 40 minutes). Food came out relatively quickly and our servers were super friendly and hospitable.

My favourite was the Po boy, which is basically battered shrimp in a peta with all the fixings. Beautifully crafted, equally delicious."}
{"text":"You should go to maha's if you have time, time and more time. And then a little more time. The food is really nice. It's yummy and like nothing else in the city. The honey cardamom latte is worth waiting 30 minutes for. And trust me, you will. These people really know how to whip up some yummy food, but they have no clue how to run a restaurant. The service is soooooo bad it's almost funny. Except it's not, it's infuriating. 

We got there today at 11:30. We waited 30 minutes for a table, which I get. Small, popular place. So you wait. We were a table of 3 behind a table of two on the wait list. A table for 3 opened up, and a table for two opened up. The table for 3 got up about 3 minutes before the table for 2. The guy seating people was going to seat the table for 2 at the 3 top! I actually had to say, 'don't you think it makes more sense to put them at the table for 2 and us at the table for 3?' To which he agreed. But had I not said something we'd probably still be waiting. Then it took them 20 minutes to get us our drinks. Finally they took our order, and we waited another 40 minutes. And one of the things we ordered were cold dips. Seriously!!!!???? Finally they brought our food, and announced that they were actually out of one of the dips. That we waited 40 minutes for. It was just one thing after another. I'm not sure I'll be back, which sucks, but it's just too frustrating."}
{"text":"I am kind of surprised that parties of two got seated quickly! I was there on a Thursday at noon, and the wait was roughly 40-50 minutes. We got seated when it was out turn. It was chilly outside, so one of the servers brought out some mint tea in disposable cups. How nice! 

Ordered the Cairo classic and mind blowing chicken. The portions were big, and the prices were fair. But... never have I ever seen a brunch spot charge for drip coffee by size. And it didn't  seem like there  was significant difference between the small and medium. And to top it off, I didn't love the coffee. 

The food was very good! Everything was spicy - not heat, but bold flavours. That's what differentiates Maha's from most brunch spots. As most people mentioned, it did take a while for the food to come out, which doesn't help the table turnover at such a busy restaurant. We had the window seat, and I actually ate quickly because I felt very self conscious about the line of people watching me \"take my time\". It's in my head, but still, faster service would have made it better. 

Do I think it's worth the 40-50 minute wait... maybe on a nice day with good company... or when they have the patio open, so turnover is faster. I do recommend you try it out at least once!"}
{"text":"First off, I want to say that if this review was based solely off food, this place would get 5 stars.

Unfortunately, there's more than food to take into account when reviewing a business, and the service and how this business is run is sorely inefficient and deserves only 2 stars.

Came here on a Sunday. First mistake, not calling to check how many people were waiting, if we could put our name on a list, if they do take out for brunch, AND what the wait time is.
I'm still not sure if you can put your name on the waiting list if you're not physically present to do so, however, I was told they don't do take out for brunch. I was also told (at 3pm when I arrived at the restaurant) that the wait time would be 30-45mins. But I did not sit down til 5pm at a table.
And this is where the issue lies. They take names down. Not phone numbers, just names and the number of people in the party. Those people can then walk out. Or wait in the shop. If they wait, they will get the next available table. If they walk out, and come back at any point before the store closes (at 5pm) AND their name was on the list before the people who had been waiting inside the store for a table, they will get the next available table.
HOW DOES THIS MAKE ANY SENSE????
I walked in at 3 and asked for a table for 2. I was told 30-45 mins. Waiting in the store ahead of me was a party of 3 and a party of 2. The customers here seem to think they should stay all day and chat. Only to be encouraged by the extremely slow service. Staff barely checked up on the customers and would give them outrageously long times to decide what to order. The food would take even longer to arrive. The two groups waiting ahead of me did not get seated for another hour. In that time, more people came to either put their names down after mine, or to get seated before me because they had already put their names down before I got there.

I do not kid you, I got seated at a table after 5pm. I did not leave this restaurant until 6pm (and unlike many of the customers I had seen previously) we did not waste time. We were ravenous, and had had plenty of time to decide on what we wanted to eat before we sat down. Considering they were closed, they still provided slow service, although I think it had sped up a bit with the desire to leave work?

I think it's so sad. This place is really hyped up. And with good cause because the food is phenomenal. But I would never go back. The service is atrocious. Why would you not just take the bloody phone number and call or text like other restaurants do? AND WHY DOES IT TAKE SO LONG TO CHECK UP ON CUSTOMERS OR SERVE FOOD??? There's definitely more than one person in that kitchen....! I would like to add that the staff there are very friendly and nice people, but it just seems like the business's mindset to provide disgustingly slow and ineffectual service to customers."}
{"text":"Got here at 10:50. It's 12:22, still haven't been seated. Is this normal for a Sunday Morning? The food will have to be exceptional. Brunch is turning out to be a 3 hour commitment."}
{"text":"4 stars.

Why am I not giving it 5 stars? The lineup.

I finally had the chance to try maha's after SO long and it was definitely worth the trip coming to the east end! We went yesterday on a Sunday morning, got in the line at 11:15 and didn't get inside until almost 12:40! I usually don't mind waiting that long for some good brunch, but yesterday was freezing cold. So eventually I became hangry. 

Once inside, we ordered the chef's platter which I highly recommend! I had the maha's mind blowing chicken and my bf had the cairo's classic. I also had the honey cardamom latte to warm myself up.

The maha's mind blowing chicken sandwich was really good but I wouldn't call it mind blowing haha. Just wish there was an even ratio of onions and chicken. It's also a great dish for instagram purposes ;).

Cairo's classic was delicious as well..those beans doe. You'll be farting up a storm lemme warn you! 

Overall, great place for brunch if you want to try Egyptian food. The food is delicious and wish I had more space in my stomach to try different things on the menu. My tip is definitely try to get there earlier before 11 so you don't have to wait that long hopefully."}
{"text":"Not sure this place is worth all the hype. The lines are long, the place on cramped, and the food was slightly above average. I'll admit, the dishes we had for brunch on a Sunday looked appetizing, and full of flavour. However, it was bland and tasteless..."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS WORTH THE WAIT GUYS!!!! 
I almost don't want to write a review so that maybe no one else will go and I can keep it all to myself. 

Being a west-end gal, I am usually very hesitant to trek all the way to the east, especially for brunch, but I am oh so glad I did. I had Egyptian Falafel (AMAZING, still drooling over it weeks later), and my friends had Cairo Classic (also so good) and Maha's Mind Blowing Chicken (I am told that it really was mind blowing). We each had a hazelnut latte, and seriously, if you get nothing else from here, get the latte. It was fabulous. The staff were very nice and attentive, and we all really enjoyed ourselves. I loved it enough to make another trek to the East end to get me some Maha's! 

See you soon y'all!"}
{"text":"Oh my the wait was long but worth it. The reviews on yelp pointed me to go here. 

They close on Wednesdays and there is always a wait during the lunch rush. 

The service was friendly and even the water was super refreshing with lime and mint. 

I ordered the Egyptian poboy. My goodness, it was divine! It's a little on the small side and was still a little hungry afterwards. But I think we all overeat these days right? 

The menu overall looked fantastic and a few more trips will really help me with all the options I want to eat! 

My coworker got a lentil soup was and was a huge fan.  Except for the black tea that was ordered. They claimed that the water in it was fishy. I didn't try so I can't comment. 

I did notice that the honey cardamom latte was extremely popular. There was a barista that was constantly making them. Would try next time!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place a 5 star because the food and the service were awesome. The food was extremely delicious and authentic,  the coffee was well done and the service was very friendly. Also, the prices are very reasonable for the portions they serve. Make sure to try the beleela (Noah's pudding), you won't regret it. However,  the reason why I gave it a 4 was the disorganization regarding the wait time and seating priority. I would highly recommend the staff to implement a more organized computerized system for seating to avoid cluttering, smoothen the flow, and improve the satisfaction with the service."}
{"text":"Believe the hype. Get the egg filled falafel. Get the mind-blowing chicken sandwich. Get the hummus and hibiscus tea. Brunch here was heavenly."}
{"text":"We've been hearing about this place for a while now and it's right down the street from us. We arrived right around noon on a Saturday and were told it would be a twenty minute wait for a table for two. Fast forward to an hour later. My fiancé and I were getting very hungry and went to the counter to ask about the status of our table. We stood there for a while without being acknowledged. A group of guys went up to the counter and asked about the status of their table for six. The man at the counter said there were a few people before them. Then someone from the group of guys came to the front and started speaking Egyptian to the man at the counter and were seated right away. I was put off by the whole experience, but I wasn't going to leave now, since I've already been waiting for over an hour. 

The two servers who took care of us were very sweet. The guy apologized for the long wait for our table and the girl made us feel very welcomed and was excited that it was our first visit to Mahas. We ordered the honey and cardamom latte, beet salad, Cairo classic, and a falafel dish. The latte came shortly after we ordered it and it was one of the best lattes I have ever had. The milk foam was so thick and flavoured perfectly. As someone who makes lattes regularly, I was impressed. The food took longer than anticipated, but it was well worth the wait. The feta that came with the Cairo classic takes a year to make and it was so good. The falafel dish was amazing. Two soft boiled eggs inside of the most fresh falafel we've ever had. I really enjoyed the salad that came with our meals, too. The perfect mix of fresh and tangy. I kind of felt that the portion of the falafel dish was kind of small for what I paid, but the flavour more than makes up for it. The beet salad was good, but nothing out of the ordinary. The table we got was also tiny. It could barely fit our two plates, let alone the water glasses. While my fiancé was trying to get a fork full of food, the plate fell into his lap because the lip was hanging off the table. Being a server, I was kind of irked that nobody offered him extra napkins to clean up the mess on his pants. 

A star was taken off for the guy at the counter letting people go ahead of us. Because of that, we got seated at the same time as people who came half an hour after us. Their way of seating guests seems a little... biased."}
{"text":"Went for brunch this past weekend and I finally got to try their mind blowing chicken! 

I've been here before but they were all out of their chicken so when we were waiting in line, I made sure to ask if they'd still have by the time we went in. I must say i enjoyed this very filling dish a lot! 

We ordered two mind blowing chicken plates and a falafel plate! Biggest thing we did wrong was order two because it was such a filling dish! We could have shared one since we also had the falafel, and it was more than enough food for us! 

If you're going to go get there early and make sure you try the mind blowing chicken!"}
{"text":"I have been to Maha's a few times - have always received consistently excellent food and service. The brunch is real treat - cauliflower sandwich is highly recommended, with a side of cumin potatoes. The cardamom latte is one of my favourite ways of starting a morning. Go early to avoid lines - but regardless, it is worth the wait. Love Maha's!"}
{"text":"Absolutely one of my favourite spots in the city. The food is made with love! It gets busy so don't be surprised if there is a lineup. Seating is limited but they open a patio in nice weather. Make sure you try the honey cardamom latte- it's amazing. Portions are generous as well. Personal favorites include the spicy Dokka, The Max sandwich, shrimp po'boy sandwich, that huge chicken sandwich, the Cairo Classic... Actually, it's pretty hard to go wrong here. I hear the lentil soup and the grilled cheese are incredible- they are on the list for future visits for sure!"}
{"text":"Really good authentic Egyptian food is very hard to find in Toronto, hence the reason why Maha's was on the top of my list of new restaurants to try. Maha's is a small family run Egyptian restaurant in the Leslieville area.

I went on a Thursday afternoon with a friend hoping to avoid any long lineups. Upon arriving we were quickly seated and the place is quite small and quaint and probably seats 20-30 people at most.

We ordered the Cairo Classic ($12 plus tax), the Pharaoh's Po Boy sandwich ($9 plus tax) and Maha's Mind Blowing Chicken sandwich ($7 plus tax) and a Turkish coffee ($3 plus tax).

The Cairo Classic ($12 plus tax): it was fresh, well executed and nicely presented. It was good but not  amazing, it's more of a hearty, comfort food breakfast meal.

The Pharaoh Po Boy sandwich ($9 plus tax): This sandwich drizzled with lime juice was amazing. perfectly seasoned, nice light batter and the shrimps were cooked perfectly. Something you have to try at Maha's.

Maha's Mind Blowing Chicken sandwich ($7 plus tax): Another sandwich that was really good, marinated chicken tossed with chopped parsley, onions and tomatoes in a sauce that consisted of tehina, mayo and garlic.

Turkish Coffee ($3 plus tax): It's really hard to describe this because I have never had Turkish coffee before but the taste is very distinct and at the same time very strong but in a good way.

Overall, I think Maha's is a great small family restaurant that offers great Egyptian food that is hard to find in Toronto. It's a small quaint place and as I mentioned before it probably doesn't seat more than 20-30 people, so I can see how busy it can get on a weekend. Nonetheless, it's definitely a restaurant worth trying with great food and friendly service."}
{"text":"Tried Maha's for the first time ever today and it was freakin good. I had the sunny eggs with fava beans and flat bread and I was full for the entire day! My friends had the Cairo Classic and Shakshuka which were all delicious. There was a decent and consistent lineup for a table but the service and flow was so smooth and it's easy to see why people would wait. We were served, fed and satisfied within an hour and we left very happy."}
{"text":"I applaud myself for waiting the 2 hours to get a table at Maha's and I ask everyone else to do the same. This place really shakes up the traditional Toronto brunch, adding a touch of freshness and a dash of authenticity.  

Maha's serves a completely traditional Egyptian brunch alongside a few untraditional options. All are amazingly good, making it very hard to decide on what to order.  This Leslieville gem is worth the wait and one can tell my the hoards of eager eaters waiting to give it a try. 

The restaurant itself is quite small, giving it a very cozy vibe to enjoy your brunch, lunch or dinner in. It's open every day of the week, except Wednesday, giving all ample opportunity to try the deliciousness that is Maha's. 

Our recommendations are the traditional Cairo Plate, cumin home fries and the dosa...but heck, in all honesty, I'd recommend it all!"}
{"text":"Good flavourful food! Not sure if its worth all the trouble getting in/ being cramped into the tiny space/sharing a table with others (be prepared for that if you are a group of two)
Waiting for an 1,5h during the winter is not fun at all 

But thats just IMHO it might be different for you. 
Fun place to try once for sure. 

My verdict: wouldn't go again, unless i find myself around the area on a weekday."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since opening with my family and we have never left less than completely satisfied. The food, out of this world. The coffee, distinctly unique with its flavours, made by clearly knowledgable baristas everytime. My family and I, time after time have been met by the genuine kind staff of maha's who I thoroughly enjoy. It's no wonder they blew up the way they did. I look forward to future visits!"}
{"text":"The wait to get into the restaurant was close to an hour. But, someone was constantly out to update us on estimated  waiting time. This small act made the people waiting feel better. 

The hour's wait was vindicated by the food which to put it mildly, was PHENOMENAL!! I got the Maha's mind blowing chicken and boy was my mind blown! The chicken was delicious and juicy and the flavors were divine. The Foole is a must try. The service was very quick. 

Will definitely be visiting many many times."}
{"text":"For those complaining about the wait: Go. Somewhere. Else.

Maha's is constantly poppin' and for very good reason! Probably the best brunch in the east end. Always fresh, always great service, always worth lining up.

My menu favourites include the lentil soup (there's a reason it's so hyped), Cairo classic, and the mind-blowing chicken sandwich. Also, I don't think it's possible for me to eat here and not order a honey-cardamom latte. One of the city's best not-so-hidden gems."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday morning (around 11:30) and there was no wait for table; my brunch partner and I got a seat right away! Service was a little slow to begin with, but I think it was because there were less staff on a Monday morning and there were already quite a few customers in the restaurant. However, once the servers did get to us, they were nothing but friendly and courteous; there was no shortage of smiles from them! 

When we got there, there was already a jug of water sitting on the table. I liked the lemon slices and sprigs of mint in the water; it imparted a refreshing flavour. 

I ordered the egyptian falafel ($12). It came with 2 falafels, a cucumber/tomato/pickled onion salad, and some cumin home fries. Although I thought the portion was a bit small, the quality made up for it. The falafels were somewhat reminiscent of a scotch egg (minus the sausage); the outer shell was thin and crisp, and the egg inside was nice and runny. The salad was fresh, and the cumin fries were pretty tasty. 

I also had the cardamom honey latte (sm: $4.25). Now, I've never had cardamom anything before so I wasn't sure what to expect exactly. While I wasn't super crazy of the cardamom flavour, I didn't feel like it was too overpowering. The latte itself wasn't overly sweet, and was nice and creamy. Latte art is always a plus. 

TLDR; will be back."}
{"text":"I have heard many good things about Maha's but have also been told that the wait can be extremely long on the weekends. I called the restaurant last week to see what the wait time would be during brunch time on Saturday and was told anywhere from 1-1.5 hours and that the rush isn't too bad after 2 PM.

My fiancé and I went to Maha's at approximately 3 PM this past Saturday. To my surprise, we were promptly seated (unfortunately, next to the bathroom so we asked to relocate to the patio). My first impression of the restaurant is that it's cute but quite small. The chairs are very uncomfortable to sit on. Unfortunately, even though we were seated promptly, the food took over 40 minutes to arrive (and we ordered only two dishes). Tables who had been seated before us were waiting for food longer than we were.

Despite issues with the timeliness of the service and furniture, the food at this place is absolutely worth it. We got the Cairo Classic and Maha's Mind Blowing Chicken and both dishes were full of flavor and extremely tasty. I would definitely go again to try other things on their menu."}
{"text":"I came here over the weekend for brunch. The wait for a table of two was about a hour. It's a tiny restaurant so it gets crowded. I ordered the honey cardamon latte - loved it, i also tried the chai latte, it was also very good, slightly sweeter than the honey cardamon. The wait for the food took a while (30 mins - 45 mins) but once it came the long wait was forgotten because the food was outstanding. I ordered the Maha's Mind Blowing Chicken and it was mind blowingly good. The combination of the spices and the garlic cream sauce was so good and different. I'm excited to try other dishes on their menu in the near future!"}
{"text":"We went around 8:15 in the morning and was seated right away.  Here's what we think of our meal:

Lentil soup is great, good flavour
Cured beef w/ scrambled egg, tastes average, comes with small salad and Egyptian bread
Falafel was very good, creamy and great flavor in the inside
Service was quick and nice

Overall, i gave them a 3-star because the pricing doesnt reflect the flavor. Nothing wrong with the flavors, but just not amazing. Will go back to try something else, but won't wait in line for more than 10+ minutes here."}
{"text":"This is like a little hidden gem in the Leslieville neighbourhood nestled amongst the houses by Greenwood and Gerrard.

The place was bustling with activity when we arrived but there wasn't a waitlist which was fine by me. :-)  It seems like a hotspot for those that enjoy their Middle Eastern coffee brews too.

The space is very bright with lots of windows letting in the sun which really adds warmth to the atmosphere.  I like the clean and modern look of the eating area.

We decided to sample the Cairo Classic (fava beans, sliced boiled eggs, falafel, and home-made tomato feta with charred balady bread) and the Date Grilled Cheese (butter sauteed dates with 3 cheese blend stacked on egg bread)

Overall, I enjoyed the Cairo Classic more than the Date Grilled Cheese.  Both dishes looked vibrant with with colour and presentation which helps to wet the appetite.

The Classic felt very hearty with the baked fava beans and slice eggs providing a very good combination along with the charred bread.  The beans were cooked to be nice and soft The Date Grilled Cheese just may not have been my thing as a brunch item but I did find the cumin fries that accompanied the dish delectable.

Will definitely want to come back in the future and explore more of the menu when time allows."}
{"text":"I came here knowing it's a really popular place and the wait times are long; I gave the place the benefit of the doubt and was eager to try Egyptian food for the first time.  The food is fantastic but based on the overall experience I rate this a 2 because at the end of the day, the amount of time spent waiting isn't worth it. 

We arrive 2:30pm on a Saturday knowing the wait would be an hour, and we were right, we got a table for two at 3:30 (it was a shared table). It's a small place, hence the line ups! Quite cramped, but cute decors. We already knew what we wanted to order but it took a while before our waiter came to place it. Mind you, the chicken was already sold out at 2:30, how disappointing. We finally got our food around 4pm. 

I got the date grilled cheese with lentil soup. I noticed the portions for their dishes aren't huge, but it's filling. The lentil soup is pureed smooth. The flavour is okay, it's not salty but it's very hot!

The grilled cheese is sweet and tasty. It's crunchy and the white bread and sweetness makes it feel like I'm eating a pineapple bun from a Chinese bakery.

It's so occupied that the waiters are too busy to serve you. They are fast to clear your plates, but it took half an hour before they filled our empty jug of water. You have to catch them to place your order or ask for the bill and they didn't ask how our food was or if we needed anything. Assuming this is how it is at most places on the weekend?

Realistically speaking, I wouldn't want to spend a whole afternoon waiting to get food. To sum it up, food is excellent, service is limited, and wait times are ridiculous."}
{"text":"Wait times are too long! Waited over an 1 hour and 45 mins!!! I can see why it's popular, food is very \"Instagram-able\" but the taste, menu and service is not worthwhile. I'd skip it as better options in the area."}
{"text":"My friend and I had each heard about Maha's a little while ago, but didn't want to try going on a Sunday as it gets so busy. So last week Monday we went over for a late breakfast, but it was still busy enough that we had to wait, although it was less than the 30min we were told. The restaurant is VERY small, definitely TOO small to function properly. We waited inside, but there would surely be people outside if it was a weekend, and the staff had to keep walking around and between people to get to the tables. All of this also meant that it was somewhat louder than most breakfast places I have been. Inside is nice and bright as the front and side of the restaurant are all windows, and there are a lot of pictures and ornaments throughout the front area where we sat. The service was not bad considering how busy it was, except that it took a while to get our lattes, which apparently are always made by the owner's son (so I have been told).

As for the food, it was all very good. I had the Basturma Scramble, which is sautéed beef and spices mixed into scrambled eggs with pita bread and salad. It was all piping hot when it arrived, and very tasty. My friend had the Cairo Classic, which is one of the various versions of foole (fava beans cooked in oil and spices) that they serve; it came with slices of boiled egg and falafel, as well as pita bread and salad. We both had a Honey Cardamom Latte to drink, which although delayed was well worth the wait. It was probably the best designed drink I have ever had, excellent tasting as well, and not too strong.

The total bill was almost $40 for two, but definitely worth it for the unique breakfast. Overall, a strong recommendation if you are prepared to wait in line. There did seem to be a short lull in guests towards the end, so perhaps the best time to go is just between breakfast and lunch on a weekday."}
{"text":"we waited an hour and half for brunch - it was just so inefficient. food was quite good, and unique but i think after an hour and half i was getting very much irritated at waiting... tastebuds became somewhat unreliable.

there was only 20 seats in the shop. A few things made our wait extra long: dishes were brought in somewhat slow, patrons sat and just chatted despite of the crazy lineup people didnt eat and leave - everyone decided to take their time and hangout, also the hostess' estimation was terrible - she said half and hour to 45 min, we waited double the time. 

chicken sandwich was good, grill cheese and lentil soup was also good - again, i'd liked it better if the wait wasn't like this or if i had know ahead of time. ok food, but the wait was too crazy."}
{"text":"I had to visit this place again after horrible first experience. Wait was much shorter, and food was slightly better. 
They didn't have mind blowing chicken AGAIN and this was at 2PM. Then ordered the chef's appetizer which they were NOT serving this afternoon. So I finally got Sunny eggs and foole. Good presentation but just like the first time beans had too much grease and bread got soggy because of the grease. Sunny side eggs were half over cooked and little burned. Bread is bread. Unlike previous visit, I finished my meal this time which is a huge plus, hence 2-star."}
{"text":"This place has really tasty food! only problem is the long waiting times but at the end it's probably worth it. The Mind-blowing Chicken Sandwich is a must-try!"}
{"text":"Always an amazing experience at Maha's, can honestly say that it's the most unique and delicious place in Toronto. 
The food is always bursting with flavor and comes in a heaping portion, enough to fill even the hungriest souls. 

I've tried the majority of their menu and doubt I'll ever get sick of any of it. Their home fries and hummus are the two things that especially stand out to me. 

My only complain about this place is the ridiculous wait time for a seat, even on a weekday. Try to go at slower times like between the lunch and dinner rush to avoid a wait. Nevertheless, the wait is always worth it"}
{"text":"Fantastic brunch! long wait but totally worth it. Best to come early or during the week."}
{"text":"So I took my brunch buddy here on a Sunday and it was amazing! My friend had the Basturma Scramble and I had the Pharoah's Po' Boy, we split some cumin home fries and both had a signature honey cardamom latte. It was all delicious! 

A few things: We were two people near the end of the line, but only waited 30 minutes because of it. Yes, people moaned and groaned when we bypassed them, but the place is super tiny. So if you're a bigger group, expect the wait to be closer to an hour."}
{"text":"You can see the line from down the street! There's not much around the area but this place is just packed. I came on a Sunday afternoon around 1pm we waited in line for over an hour and seated around 2.15pm for a table of 3, so be prepared to wait and the line is outdoors. The collective hunger and slow loss of patience creates great comradery with the others in line. Tables of 2 seemed to move by marginally faster. (not gonna lie there were also tables of the people doddling around after they were done eating...) 

Service was friendly but not as speedy for the amount of people waiting in line, the decor is quite eclectic its like you walked into someone's home. The place it very small and was a bit cramped. 

The lentil soup is amazing! and its vegan but you would never know it has this rich and meaty quality to it. Its so savory with deep flavours! 

The pan-fried tender beef liver ($14) was ok, it was slightly dry but if you like the liver taste this one is for you. A squeeze of lemon helps it a lot. The pharoh's po-boy was served in a beautiful shell ($12) The shrimp was large but the sandwich felt quite greasy. 

The Cairo classic was delish though! ($14) big serving of savory bean stew with hard-boiled eggs on top with lots of pita bread to mop up the saucy beans. It also comes with a small side salad of tomatoes, peppers and onions. It was filling and satisfying. Also got an extra side of their falafel (2 for $5) and they were great! really crispy on the outside and lots of herbs on the inside!

They have have a selection of pastries which we snacked on while in line, they are $3 each and they are quite small. The cardamon latte ($4.75) was great though, really hot coffee and sweetened with honey a bit steep in price but would get it again. 

Would definitely come back, except not in the winter especially with the outdoor line."}
{"text":"Arrived at 2:20pm on a Saturday and got a table for two 1 hour 30 minutes later.

Saw Maha (she had a nametag) cooking in the kitchen herself as we waited :)

Here's what we ordered:
* Maha's Mind Blowing Chicken Sandwich: had parsley, onions, tomato and garlic sauce. Really delicious and filling, presentation is great as well
* Cumin Homefries: good, came piping hot
* Cairo Classic: fava beans with boiled egg, a falafel, and bread. I had a couple bites of this, pretty tasty as well though I preferred my sandwich

Overall good experience, would go back on a weekday assuming it's less busy then!"}
{"text":"We came here before noon on a Monday, thought we could skip the wait because  it's a Monday but still waited almost half an hour, which is fine because I'm sure it must be a lot worse during the weekend! First impression as soon as we entered was 'omg this place is so cute!'. It's a tiny little cafe/restaurant that's decorated with lots of plants and wall art so it feels super cozy on a snowy morning.

We ordered the Cairo Special and Maha's Mind Blowing Chicken. The Special was really good. You open up the pita and stuff the beans, egg, falafel inside to eat. We liked the chicken sandwich a lot more though, it was just as the name says, mind blowing. It reminds you of chicken shawarma but not as heavy and it's not a sandwich/burger you can really eat with your hands if you have a look at how it's presented. We also got side of falafel and eggplant (forgot the name of it) to start. The eggplant comes like a sauce to go with the bread, and that was also delicious. 

They leave a bottle of water at your table with a long mint (I think) leaf inside which I would give them bonus points for. I also ordered the honey cardamom latte. At first I was like 'wow it's strong', then you'd start wanting to keep sipping on it. 

I'd love to come back another time to try their other sandwiches which looks amazing in pictures, and I'm sure they taste as good as it looks."}
{"text":"Worth the wait every time. They don't have a large menu, which I love...every single dish is a hit. But I recommend the Cairo foole and the chicken sandwich. Their lentil soup is also . They also serve a delicious watermelon/feta salad in the summer seasons. Food is a solid 10/10

The place is very quaint and homey. They only seat 24 people though so you usually have to wait in line for seats, which isn't too bad in the summer time. If they expand they definitely will eliminate the wait time but I think having such few seating in the space in a way guarantees better quality. All the food really feels like it's done with such care and love."}
{"text":"It took us good 40min to get their mind-blowing chicken sandwich and scrambled eggs. 
We got there very early (at around 9:30 on Sunday morning) as we were worried about the line. The place was not even packed and most tables were already working on their food when we got there. SO WHY DID IT TAKE SO LONG TO SERVE OUR FOOD? I still can't believe how slow they were. 

The price is reasonable and the flavor was there. Loved the atmosphere as well. I would only recommend this place for the one-time experience (exotic, cozy atmosphere and photogenic food)."}
{"text":"Maha's is incredible. From the great vibe to the amazing food, Mahas is a must stop anytime I am in Toronto. I recommend the falafel or the fool with eggs as a great filling brunch option. The max is also really Good too. A must visit for all looking for great Egyptian/middle eastern food in Toronto :)"}
{"text":"I ordered: Mind blowing chicken, Classic Cairo, a side of lentil soup, honey cardamom latte ~ $40 for 2 people

+1 Price vs portion: If you order all that I did and not a big eater, you probably have left over. 

+2 Taste + food presentation + drink 
- very herby, earthy and healthy, I loved it
- flavourful, right amount of saltiness, beautifully decorated with pleasant dishware.
- meant to be shared food

+ 1  Comfortable place to eat + customer service
- traditional background music and store decoration created a cultural ambiance that takes you out of Toronto for a sec.
- staffs were nice and accommodating, we were sipping on latte while waiting
- you will probably get cold-feets while eating if it's a cold day
- crammed sitting space which added positively to the experience

-1 something just did not resonate with me to give it a 5 

What you do to improve your experience here: 
1. come during non-rush hour or you will wait at least 30 minutes for a spot
2. do not sit near the door if it's a cold day"}
{"text":"Got there at 930am for Sunday brunch and even then, I had to wait for 45 minutes for a table for two. The small restaurant was cramped because it was full of people waiting inside in the tiny space because of the cold.

 With the nice weather looming and outside patio, now hoping the wait won't be as bad. There is even a table for one for those who do not mind eating alone :) In the end though, it was worth it! I am glad that I went for the food and the experience.  Maha really deserves top mark for being one of top Egyptian restaurant in Toronto.


One of the main dish I tried was the Cairo Classic. This traditional breakfast dish consists of fava beans and is prepared in multiple variations.  They mix tomatoes and onions into perfectly seasoned fava beans.  Enjoy them with a sliced boiled egg, a falafel, a dollop of creamy home-made tomato fera, charred balady bread and salata balady. Yummy :)   

Follow me @camerafirst to see where I go eat next :)"}
{"text":"This place is golden.

I had the po boy sandwich with a side of the fries. It was piping hot, supremely flavourful, and altogether mindblowingly delicious (not unlike their mindblowing chicken). I actually thought of waiting for another hour for a second helping before I snapped out of it. I stole bits and pieces of my friends' dishes, but none of them came close to the po boy. Don't miss out on this. You deserve it.

I visited Maha's for the first time at around noon on a Saturday. Big mistake. It took my party of 5 approximately 2 hours to be seated, and another hour or so to be served. This place is TINY - seating 20 people in total. Therefore, you shouldn't make the mistake of strolling into the neighborhood with a completely empty stomach. You might be in for a long wait depending on the time of your visit.

I legit want to visit Egypt now."}
{"text":"Of all the places I have give one star review, this one hurts me the most. MAHA's I used to sing songs of this restaurant and would tell people how restaurants like these are what makes Toronto's food scene great. But sadly Maha's also employs shady business practices and smug attitude :(

I went there again, waited in the line for about 1.5 hours or something, finally got a scene and we were ready to order. We had a person with us that doesn't eat vegetables/beans but eats chicken, we saw on the menu that she could order popcorn chicken but without the vegetables.

Server came, we began ordering and mentioned about mindblowing chicken without tomatoes and stuff, he said they can't do it. We showed him the menu, it is written \"MADE TO ORDER WITH FRESH INGREDIENTS\", I shouldn't need to tell servers what made to order means, but i told him anyways, he was apologetic but said he can't do since he will get shit from the chefs, but he said he will call the manager.
The manager came, and we said we need mindblowing chicken without vegetables, he said it's not possible and if you don't like it \"LEAVE\", we were all like WTH? is it that easy for you to dismiss customers?

I asked him, I am not here to argue, please tell me what is the meaning of \"Made to order\", he said it means it's made from fresh ingredients? wrong but ok, then why can't you do it without chicken? \"Well, it's premade and we will have to seperate chicken\", ok then how is it made fresh again?

I asked to speak with the owner, he said \"I am the owner BOSS, if you don't want the popcorn chicken you can leave\".



False advertisement, no shits given about customers since they are so popular, they can get away with smug attitude."}
{"text":"The food may have been great and flavorful. But the service was slow and the waitress was not attentive at all. We waited for almost an hour to get seated and once seated we didn't get served for another 30 min. Then the food we ordered was forgotten and didn't come out for another 30 mins. In the end we spent 3 hours at this place. My boyfriend had to go in to pay the bill cause I developed a severe allergic reaction to the food...will never go here again!"}
{"text":"Probably the best Sunday lunch spot in the city and also my favourite. Can't do brunch here even though most people do just because of the type of food. The presentation is fantastic for the prices. The atmosphere has such a homey and cozy feel. Great service with casually dressed waiters quickly refilling your glass. The food is absolutely fantastic especially their crazy chicken sandwich contraption. The traditional Egyptian eggplant and le til dishes are a must try. Chairs are a bit on the smaller side so not the type to get cozy in. Great patio. This the type of place I would come back on a regular basis and bring friends and family."}
{"text":"I stopped in to Maha's quickly for 2 take-out coffees. The barista suggested the honey cardamon latte and another organic chocolate hazelnut latte instead of traditional coffee. The drinks were delicious, as was the homemade breakfast cookie I picked up (couldn't resist the look of all the yummy baked goods). The staff were VERY friendly; I can't wait to go back for sit-down brunch or lunch!"}
{"text":"The hype on this place is real! We waited 1.5 hours for Sunday brunch. I do not recommend you wait that long for brunch. Just come back another day. 

The mind blowing chicken is a must try! The flavours pop in your mouth and leaves you wanting more. Remember to ask for their homemade hot sauce! It is so good! To complement your meal, you should try the honey and cardamom latte.

Overall, Maha's is an amazing brunch location, but it is not worth 1.5 hours of waiting. It should still be on everyone's must-try list though."}
{"text":"Decided to check out the hype of this place, and it was okay. The inside was very squished and cozy, felt like I was at someone's house.

Ordered the shrimp po'boy, cumin fries, and Maha's \"mind blowing\" chicken.

The shrimp po'boy was soooooo good. Like it was honestly the best thing out of all the things i ordered. Shrimp wasn't overcooked, the batter wasn't too heavy, and the sauce complimented the shrimp. The cumin fries were also good! Loved the dipping sauce it came with. The chicken was... alright. Wasn't as mind blowing as I thought it would be.

The one thing I want to comment on is that the server kept calling me and my friend ladies. I'm not a lady. It'd be cool if servers in general stop assuming people's genders cause that makes me not want to come back."}
{"text":"Me and my partner came here on a Thursday afternoon around noon knowing that even though it was during the week we would probably still have to wait as this is still peak lunch/brunch time. We were right, and there were about 10 people (three tables of 2 and 1 table of 4) ahead of us. You have to put your name in so they can keep track of who's next and when a table becomes available they will seat whoever is next on the list, meaning if a table of two is next on the list and a table that would fit four has become available, they will still seat the couple of two there. I appreciate this as the list is followed exactly and it keeps it fair for all who are willing to stand and wait. They estimated our wait time to be a half hour or so, we were seated about twenty five minutes later, so their estimate was accurate. We got a two seater table right at the back near the patio door and washroom - it was quite chilly in this spot and I left my coat on until our meals arrived. Maybe they have a door open in the back for the kitchen to air out as it's tiny with quite a few people cooking in it and I imagine it gets pretty hot. Their comfort is obviously important to keep food service running smoothly so if that's the case it is totally understandable. Or perhaps the door to the patio was letting in a draft - either way it certainly wasn't a deal breaker and I'm quite sure it isn't a full time issue as it was a windy cool day and drafts are bound to happen in older buildings in the city. 

My partner ordered the mind blowing chicken sandwich and I ordered the date grilled cheese with cumin home fries. I also ordered a side of mixed pickles. We also both had the honey cardamom lattes. 

The lattes were well made and not overly sweet. There seemed to be only one barista (who was extremely calm and looked very happy to be there!) So please be patient as he only has two hands and can only make one drink at a time. His beautiful drink was worth the wait. 

The mixed pickles were brought out first and included green and black olives, turnip (I believe) beets, and hot peppers. I am a huge fan of anything pickled and was really happy. They were sprinkled with spices and I especially loved the beets and turnips -  perfectly tart and fresh! I did not try a hot pepper but my parter did and he said it was spicy but not overly so. 

The mind blowing chicken sandwich came out next. My partner was pleased with the chicken sandwich and liked the tahini sauce that was on it. He couldn't finish the whole thing, but polished off most. He says he would try something else next time as he felt though it was yummy, it was lacking something for him that he couldn't put his finger on.. Please note that's only due to his personal preferences and not a reflection or criticism of the recipe itself. 

My grilled cheese was awesome! I was a bit apprehensive at first about the dates, but I had nothing to fear because it worked so well! The salty richness of the cheese mixing with the sweet dates and honey was a perfect blend of flavors and I would absolutely order this again. My meal included a side and I opted for the cumin home fries. The home fries come with a sauce which I think was the tahini (I could be wrong here as I didn't get a chance to ask) It was SO good. I would put that on everything if I could. I dipped my grilled cheese in it mostly and honestly couldn't get enough. The home fries themselves were good and had pickled onion in them which I thought was a nice addition. Nothing needed salt or pepper as everything that came to the table was seasoned very well. I couldn't finish all the home fries or pickles so I brought them home. 

The wait staff was very busy and it did take a bit longer to get the bill or order another drink in comparison to some other restaurants, but if you know this going in then you should be okay. Don't expect a fast food type of service as everything is made to order and that needs a little time - if you want fast, go to a diner. The quality of food that is provided is absolutely worth the wait and if you have the patience you won't be disappointed.

It seems as though everyone who works here chips in to bus tables, take orders, and bring food and all three people who helped/served us were kind, polite and seemed genuinely happy to be there which made the experience even better. It really shows when the staff are passionate and care about the food and service they are providing. 

Over all this was a great lunch and we will certainly be returning. The food was flavorful, beautiful (so colorful!) and authentic. Prices are spot on in my opinion with our food, two cardamom lattes and one real glass bottle of coke being around forty bucks - and after my tip about fifty. Can't complain about that! 

I heard the waitress tell a customer that less busy times are before 10am and after 3pm so if you want to try this place without as much waiting maybe aim for those times.

We really look forward to another visit soon!"}
{"text":"Whenever I drive by this place on a weekend, I have to wonder: what's Maha's, and what's up with the Portlandia 'Brunch Village' lineup leading to it? On a good weekend there's usually a lineup that can rival the near-literal Brunch Village lineups down further south at Lady Marmalade and Bonjour Brioche on Queen East Leslieville. But we're out here much off the beaten path on Greenwood Avenue. So what gives?

So I found out... not on a weekend, which is an effective way to avoid these damned lineups. And you still get the same comforting Egyptian infused gwai-lo brunch food that has made this new down-to-earth east end bistro an instant hit. I don't know much about Egyptian cuisine, so I guess I have to assume Maha's serves a good representation of it, especially considering the people behind it.

Much typical of brunch the menu is loaded with eggs (and I am someone who gets bored with eggs benedicts). It is also heavy in Middle Eastern influence and flavours, of course. And it comes in greasy spoon sized portions and much reasonable prices. Delicious doesn't cut it--this stuff was egg-citingly fun! Everything had a fresh and orderly presentation, and mixed well. Bread and beef was fine along with the rest of the Basturma Scramble, and the cumin home fries were an interesting touch. And also their signature honey and cardamom latte is something worth trying. It's a great and unique Toronto brunch experience for sure (but I do not do lineups).

{TTC: 31 or 506 to Greenwood/Gerrard, and walk north a block... or until you see a sudden lineup worthy of a TV show in an otherwise quiet neighbourhood.}"}
{"text":"Amazing food, I had the Cairo classic.  Everything we had was great. Lots of flavour."}
{"text":"I've attempted to eat here before and the lineups were 45 minutes to 1.5 hours long. So I had been wanting to go here for a long time. We finally got up early enough on a Sunday to only have a 15 minute wait. (Definitely come early to avoid the wait) I got the mind blowing chicken sandwich and my hubby got the breakfast that came with an egg, some hummus and a few other things. I have to say we were really disappointed with that taste of the food, it was beautifully prepared, but the chicken had this very strong raw onion taste and my husbands food was just ok. The coffees were good"}
{"text":"Food: Our party of 3 ordered the mind blowing chicken sandwich, Cairo classic, a side of lentils soup and cumin fries. 

Taste: The chicken, lentils soup and fries were to die for! Especially on a cold day like today. The Cairo classic was okay. Food was very fresh. The fries were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I wish I ordered the full size of soup instead of the side. Food overall 5/5.

Other: -1 star for the wait. We arrived at Maha's at 8:55am on a Sunday morning hoping for no lineup, but we still had to wait another 20mins outside in the cold. The restaurant is very cute and cozy. Only 24 people can be seated at once. You also can't leave your name and number down, must be in line.

Will come back at an odd time!"}
{"text":"Have heard rave reviews about Maha's and and was excited to be driving by, I decided to pop in for takeout.
My falafel and hummus was HEAVY on the salt which was super disappointing.  Although the beet salad was absolutely delicious; slightly sweet, tangy, garlicky and lots of parsley. The Caramel baklava was also very good.

Maybe I just had bad luck?  I'll head back at some point, but with caution."}
{"text":"I ordered the Egyptian falafel and the mind blowing chicken sandwich to share with my friends. Both dishes were very delicious but if I had to pick a favourite it would he the mind blowing chicken. 

I also ordered the honey cardamom latte. I didn't really the way it tasted (it was probably the cardamom) and the coffee was too strong for my liking. Next time I'd probably go for a different latte

This place is pretty small and we had to wait for a while outside to get a table but it was definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"My friend suggested we meet at 9 am before the crowd hits but the crowd was already lining up when we got there. It's a small place and child friendly. Although, service could be faster to manage the crowd - we waited for at least 10 minutes before our drink order was taken. The menu is not overwhelming but offers enough choices for diners. Staff also explained what was in each dish. Everything we had was tasty. Will go back agin to try other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"As a first timer for Egyptian food, this place should be the go to spot for great food. They load flavour into every dish but the sauce on some dishes may be a slight overload. Really cramped and only wheelchair-accessible to a patio where seated guests have to stand up, and physically reposition themselves because of how tightly spaced the place is."}
{"text":"Really good falafel.  Appetizer plate gives you a bit of everything.  The salads and dips, especially foule, are really bursting with flavour.  Authentically middle eastern in flavour, which means bold, acidic, oniony, garlicky, and spicy.  Good place to go vegetarian, which I rarely like to do, because the non-meat items are that tasty."}
{"text":"My experience with maha's was amazing. They have a lot of vegetarian options. Their falafels are one of the best. Service was also really good. I would love to go again."}
{"text":"Really a 5/5, but the more than 1hr wait is not the exact way I'd like to wake up and spend on a Saturday morning. They only have 24 seats I believe. Regardless, MIND BLOWING (ha) food and it was almost pretty much worth it.

I'm a pretty impatient person. But Maha's was worth it, although I was not as hungry waiting (so don't wait hungry!!)

Try everything if you can!! 

Mind Blowing Chicken (14) - IT LIVES UP TO ITS NAME. Portions are great, sauce is amazing and the dish is just really satisfying. It tastes satisfying unhealthy but you leave actually feeling good and not greasy. 

Cairo Classic (14) - Also superb. The beans were hearty, tomato feta on point and is a nice, lighter brunch dish. 

Service is friendly - only good things I can say about this place!! 

If it didn't have an hour long wait, I'd be back again and again. 

Last few things: they DON'T do reservations, large parties will def be harder/longer wait, pls get the mind blowing chicken, AND THEY HAVE REALLY COOL STICKERS."}
{"text":"We don't get it. Maybe it's us.
Food was okay. Home fries were soggy. The foole had nice flavour. Basturma (kinda like a pastrami) was okay. Cairo Classic was not novel. The best part of the meal was the honey cardamom latte.

One major observation - there are seats very close to the washroom. People go into the washroom and then don't close the door after they use it. You can smell that \"washroom\" smell. Super unappetizing. 

Didn't have to wait long (around 15 minutes), so that was a plus. We would say that anything longer than that, then don't bother. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Totally f'in yummy! We showed up when it opened and the tables were full by the time we left. The best latte I have ever had and I won breakfast by ordering the shrimp po boy. So very yummy!"}
{"text":"Im very hard pressed to give them a 4. It's a great brunch place, with great food. The Cairo classic is a beautiful dish and so are some of the other ones.
However the lack of enthusiasm by a particular server, running out of Turkish coffee, and also some of the dishes were a big hit or a miss. 

Id probably come here in the future, but stick to only the top favorites."}
{"text":"Cairo Time: Tuesday at 5 pm

Our experience at Maha's evoked memories of our trip to Egypt and of Ruba Nadda's beautifully crafted film, \"Cairo Time\".  In the words of Rotten Tomatoes' film critique, \"Though potentially too slowly paced for some, Cairo Time lingers long after the closing credits...\"

Thanks to Yelpers' comments, we planned our meal for the less-busy and auspicious day of Tuesday at 5 pm. As we arrived at the corner of the quiet residential street, a car pulled out of a spot and we were able to slip in -- right behind a car with the license plate \"Maha\". A welcoming omen.

Pots of flowers and herbs decorate the restaurant, like the terrace balconies of many local homes in Egypt. A friendly waitress seated us immediately and provided both mint-infused water and menus. There were 2-3 other tables occupied when we arrived.

Of course, we had to have the Mindblowing Chicken Sandwich and the Pharaoh's Po' Boy.,The two of us also ordered the cumin fries and falafels plus the Arnabeet cauliflower sandwich to take home. Everything was mindblowingly delicious. Full of subtle spices and homemade tomeya (Egyptian garlicky mayo) that made me want to lick my fingers!

As previous reviewers have noted, the service was friendly but slow. We didn't mind. We were seated and prepared to enjoy the food and our conversation. Next time, perhaps I'll bring my backgammon board with mother-of-pearl inlay which I bought at the Khan-Al-Kalili Bazaar in Cairo. That's what people do there: go to cafés, order tea, smoke shisha, play backgammon, eat some food and relax. 

I love falafels and have tasted my fair share of delicious ones, including those from L'As du Falafel in Paris. I loved Maha's falafel texture and seasoning. The waitress explained that their falafels (pronounced by Maha as \"fa-LAY-ful\") are made with Fava Bean, not chick pea. I look forward to our next trip when we taste the Falafel Wrap with its falafel mix encasing soft-boiled eggs. A legume version of Scotch eggs.

Also looking forward to the Foul, a Fava Bean purée typically served as street food breakfast in Cairo. Egyptian comfort food."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, however the service is slow. Everything is made fresh however. 

Once they get a bigger kitchen and staff, this place will be a perfect rating."}
{"text":"After months of putting it off, we finally did brunch at Maha's. 

We showed up on a busy Saturday morning and were immediately greeted by the warm and homey feel of the place.  The restaurant was busy, but we were seated almost immediately.  The staff were friendly and helpful throughout.

The restaurant is tiny but comfortable.  Black and white photos and various Egyptian-style trinkets adorn the walls. Traditional music played in the backroad as we sipped Egyptian style mint tea from whimsical little cups.  I asked for a Turkish coffee but was told that they don't make it on busy days (takes too much time space and effort).  Today was no exception.

The food did not take long to arrive. The lentil soup and the foole & eggs were absolutely to die for!! The shakshouka was decent but not to my liking (I like mine made with runny eggs).  Overall Maha's is definitely worth the visit and will definitely make its into regular rotation."}
{"text":"This is a cute spot worth the commute!
Flavourful and generous portions of Egyptian street food. 
 
The customer service here is spot on. Very happy to answer questions about the food or make suggestions.

I had read previous reviews before going about the time it takes for the food to arrive. I would have to agree. It does take time for food to arrive so to kill some time try the Egyptian black tea or the HOney Cardamom Latte while you wait.

I had the Maha's Mind Blowing Chicken Sandwich.  It was more exploding with the amount of filling bursting out on the plate. It is definitely something to witness.

Ps....it is a busy spot!"}
{"text":"Everything I've eaten at Maha's has been seriously decadent and delicious. Brunch here is a beautiful way to start your weekend or your Sunday. You may need to wait in line for up to an hour, I like to get on the list and then go for a stroll and window shopping in Little India, there's lots to see there. You can also order a Honey Cardamom Latte while you wait, you'll probably want at least 2 while you are there. Then eat the Mind Blowing Chicken, or the Pharoah's Po'Boy, Falafel Eggs, Date Grilled Cheese, Lentil Soup, or anything else on the menu. The falafel are the best ever. 

Maha's, you'd get five stars easy if the service was better. I'm giving four because the chef owner has come out to thank me for waiting after a particularly long wait for food, food that was spectacularly delicious. Her kids work the front of the house, and while they all seem lost and in over their heads, the pretty one especially has difficulty - I've had to remind him 3-4 times before to get a latte without apology, or that I've already paid the bill. The waitstaff not only waits tables but also buses tables and tries to keep up with wait list crowd control, but basically this means they do a poor job at all of these things. On my most recent visit. I watched a busy server make 3 separate trips to clear a table - one to clear plates, one to clear glassware, one to wipe down the table. It took her at least 3 minutes per visit, as she had to navigate through the waitlist crowd both ways, who all should have been outside. But that's 10 minutes that someone isn't sitting at that table, and 10 minutes that her other tables aren't getting their food. Kick the waitlist outside - no apologies! Or let people call to get on the list. Hire a busser and let them use a tray - that's one minute to clear a table. What Maha's really needs is a general manager who keeps everyone moving and organized, it would allow then to turn tables twice as fast. The food is incredible, I hope that they find more skilled and hospitable help soon. The crowds will keep coming!"}
{"text":"A few of my friends were eager to try Maha's and I'm always down to try something new, however I was a bit disappointed. 

Service was okay, received our food on time but the waitress was a bit rude, and she disappeared for awhile. Moving on to the food, I tried the Shrimp Poboy and the Mind Blowing Chicken Sandwich. 

I did not enjoy the Shrimp, it was crispy and well cooked but there wasn't any flavor to it. The sauce on top was Tahini and it was very average. Moving on to the staple, the Chicken sandwich was okay. The bread was nicely buttered but in terms of an actual dish, I wasn't too impressed. There was flavor from the base which I believe is a foul (middle eastern breakfast dish) and all topped with more tahini. 

I wasn't too impressed and won't be coming back. 

Keep Eating, 
Angela"}
{"text":"Came on a Monday afternoon and the wait was still a little over an hour. So put your name down and maybe walk around the area. One of the girls there told us we can call in an hour to see if our table would be available, so that's a plus. The space is definitely on the small side with limited seating. Staff was friendly and the service was awesome. I especially loved the interior, very bright and cultural.

We got the Cairo Classic and the Mind-Blowing Chicken Sandwich, as recommended by our server and the table next to us as favourites. The food took awhile to prepare, which is why I think there's always such long waits. But at least that means the food is always made to order and fresh. The Cairo Classic tasted quite strong in my opinion, but definitely hearty and filling. I personally loved the Mind-Blowing Chicken Sandwich, it was just a mountain of goodness, so flavourful and fresh to the taste. 

If you're looking to support family-owned restaurants and something different from the usual spots in and around Toronto, give this place a try. Would probably give them a 4 stars if the wait was a little shorter. I can't imagine how long it'd be during the weekends. Nonetheless, good food.

{"text":"I don't know what to say about Maha that hasn't already been said.

The place is as fantastic as the review says it is. The wait for a table is also as long as the review says it is. If you're willing to wait you'll enjoy your experience. 

Go hungry and go feeling open minded and you'll love every bite. The honey cardamom latte was to die for, the lentil soup fantastic. I also enjoyed the traditional veggie Egyptian sandwiches but there was so much food I couldn't even finish them.

Thumbs up to Maha! So glad to have it in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Authentic Egyptian food run by a small family - it's great for brunch, but also great for an early dinner (since they close at 7pm on weekdays). Otherwise for brunch on a weekend, you're guaranteed to wait about an hour! The Mind-Blowing Chicken Sandwich is amazing, loaded with meat and sauce, probably the best thing on the menu and what they're famous for. Try also the Pharaoh's Po Boy, which is roasted eggplant in a sandwich. Fantastic! Also pair it all with a Honey Cardamom Latte - a unique flavour I haven't seen anywhere else."}
{"text":"People complaining about a long wait are missing the point - this is a 'family' restaurant - meaning Maha, the mother, is in the kitchen cooking her food with as much attention to detail as any place in the city.  The servers are lovely and considerate - even when I'm picking up take-out for my vegan girlfriend, they remember her allergies and dietary needs.  

Please try to go on off hours so as not to get frustrated - it's really wonderful food, service and attention to detail.  Well worth any wait."}
{"text":"Friendly service, great food. Definitely surpassed my expectations. Lentil soup was da bomb!!! Po boy was pretty good too. You cant help but love this place!"}
{"text":"This is the first time to a Egyptian restaurant. We walked inside and it was so hot. I ordered the Cairo classic and my friend order the chicken sandwich. They were out of bread so they used pita instead. They didn't want to make the Turkish coffee because it was busy. Ok fine since the waitress was very nice. After we order about 10 min later we were just too hot so we went outside to the patio. The food took more then 25 min after we ordered to get to is. It was not busy anymore. When the food came I didn't understand why it would take that long because those food can be easily made. The taste of the bean had this odd taste. Maybe that's how it suppose to be but I definitely didn't like it. Although it's not expensive but for some beans and one egg with a fried cake and a little salad it was really under fair. 
I give the 2 star for service since they were very nice. Not for atmosphere or food."}
{"text":"3 1/2 stars

Nice concept (Egyptian breakfast/coffee shop) and vibe and a good addition to the neighbourhood.

We visited around 8:30 on a Sunday morning with our toddler and were promptly offered a high chair, which was awesome. The service in general was quite good.

Unfortunately they did not have the Egyptian Falafel that day (apparently they were having difficulty sourcing the quails eggs or something) so we ordered the Cairo Classic (hard boiled egg, fava beans, falafel and balady), the Basturma scramble (spiced scrambled eggs with cured beef) and the date grilled cheese with lentil soup for the little one.

I didn't find the service to be unreasonably slow (perhaps because it wasn't busy when we arrived) but they definitely could improve the timing of dishes as each of our three items came out well after the previous one rather than all together or close together.

The food was different and tasty (especially the grilled cheese and lentil soup), though didn't blow my mind either. That being said, I don't think I've had Egyptian food since I was in Egypt many, many years ago. 

Presentation of the food was lovely. The table next to us got the Po'Boy, which looked amazing, so I'd probably order that next time around."}
{"text":"East end brunch fans, rejoice! Maha's is here! It's out of the usual way in terms of brunch fare: the menu boasts Egyptian cuisine done up brunch style. Think eggs, beans, aromatic spice, flat bread. 

I've been here twice for weekend brunch and it is ridiculous for lineups. That's why this place gets 4/5 stars. Bringing the west-end, Darwinian no-reservation policy to the eastside, we get hungry groups of people promised a \"20 minute wait\" standing idly for the better part of an hour. If you are prepared to wait for weekend brunch, bring a good book or a good friend, and wait for the scrumptious food. It's (almost) worth it! If you aren't prepared to wait, I'm told it's great during the week on evenings, with little wait time.

I can highly recommend the sunny fool dish and the honey cardamom latte!"}
{"text":"A- What kind of a restaurant doesn't take reservations! B- what kind of a restaurant has 4 tables? 
C- even with the wait the food wasn't that great.. please stop hyping up places that have mediocre food!!!!"}
{"text":"My only hesitation from giving it five stars is because of how it is challenging to bring a family with a toddler here. They only had one high chair when we were there, and the narrow rooms made it awkward to navigate.  But it is an amazing breakfast/brunch option."}
{"text":"Authentic food.
The traditional \"foole\" was delicious. The whole food presentation was beautiful.
Great and friendly staff/chef.
We didn't experience that much of wait time. I would suggest to go around their closing time at 3-4 pm. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful place. I wish I could come here five times a day!
Excellent food, excellent service, excellent atmosphere & staff.

Truly wonderful Mediterranean-style food with its own unique twist. 

Do yourself and your family a big favor. Come dine at Maha's today!"}
{"text":"Great service, delicious food, and amazing lighting!

I never been around this area before so this was quite an exciting experience for me. Upon entering, a worker smiled at us and told us to sit wherever we wanted to including the patio. My friend and I decided to sit inside, by the window. It was a very sunny day as well so the place was just glowing and it was beautiful. Looking at menu, many of the dishes sounded super tasty, but for the others, I had no idea what the ingredients were. I was going to order the grilled cheese, but my friend insisted to try something new. I ultimately ordered the Basturma Scramble and had no idea what it was. The waitress was very kind and she provided great customer service. The food took a long time to come, considering there was only one other table at the time. When the food arrived, oh my goodness. It looked amazing and delicious! After taking a bit of my meal, I fell in love with the marinating of it. The portion wasn't big or small, but just perfect. The meal came with scrambled eggs with some sort chopped of meat, along with 4 cut off pieces of pita bread. There was also a cup of assorted vegetables on the side. The place quickly got packed after about 20 minutes, but the place still remained relaxing and peaceful. This is honestly the perfect place to enjoy some delicious brunch and to take nice instagram pictures! I recommend this place to everyone as there is nothing wrong with trying something new and out of your comfort zone. I am definitely coming back here in the future!"}
{"text":"I was dragged by a friend at 8 am on a Saturday morning when I first tried (or even heard of) this charming joint! Little that I know it would've been one of my favourite brunch spots in the city.. I'm even brave enough to say it's currently in my top 5. We were early enough to be seated right away, but the second time I came with a group of 4 and it took us 1.5 hours (still worth it!). 

I'd never been to an Egyptian restaurant, but both times I was lucky enough to have had been with those who are very familiar with Egyptian food, so I was always told what to get. Everytime, I was blown away! 

Below are some of the items on the menu that I've tried so far:

1) Lentil soup - THE BEST lentil soup I've had in Toronto (And I'm not exaggerating, I promise!). The soup is so full of flavor that every sip I ended it with an \"ummm, it's so good\" (And was told to stop). It's the perfect soup to begin and end the day. 

2) Maha's mind blowing chicken - Very tasty and flavorful chicken (sandwich?) and very generous portion. Although I thought that it had a bit more of the 'vege stuff', and felt very heavy after. 

3) Basturma Scramble - My second favourite item after the lentil soup. It's very simple yet so tasty! The flavor of the egg mixed with beef bacon was out of this world. One of my friends described it as \"eggs tasting like pancakes\". Not sure if I completely agree with that, but I'm sure it meant something really good! It's served with a small portion of fresh garden veges and charred pita bread. Perfection in a plate!

4) Kebda Eskarandani - according to my Egyptian friend, beef liver is one of the most common meats for the locals, And of course I had to try it! I didn't realize the burst of flavor that would have come with the first bite! I was in love. If you're a beef liver lover, this is made for you! They're served with pita bread and amazingly delicious and fresh tahini.

5)Hummus - I haven't been to the middle East, but I'll say that this is one of the best hummus I've had in my life! The texture was perfectly smooth and creamy and goes perfectly well with some charred pita bread. 

On top of the amazing food they serve, I think Maha's has this charm about it that makes people want to come back. I love the feel of a family running the cafe, there's something so personal about it. 

I will absolutely recommend this place to anyone and everyone (even with the lines)! Be prepared to be so stuffed :)"}
{"text":"Hands down one of my favourite bruches here in Toronto!!

I knew the line up was going to be crazy, so me and my friends went early on SAturday morning hoping that we won't have to wait too long. They open at 8am, and by the time we got there at 9:15am there is definitely a small line already there!  There is street parking available on side streets and also on Gerrard and Greenwood - I parked on Greenwood and it was free :)

Luckily it was raining too, and perhaps that deterred some of the other brunchers, we only waited in line for about 25-30 mins so it wasn't bad at all! We got in around 9:45am :)

The inside is very warm, friendly and cozy. Love the decor! Staff is very friendly, and they came to check on us periodically to see if we need anything. The lattes do take a little while to arrive - about 10 mins, but their restaurant is packed :) While we were sitting I noticed they have one table for one - an idea in mind that next time i might just come on my own, and won't have to wait in line! :)

In the end, we ordered Cairo Classic, Pharoah's Po Boy and mind blowing chicken to try, and for drinks we ordered both honey cardamom lattee and  hazelnut latte (they have lactose free milk available too!) 

I wasn't sure if i would like it at first because cardamom if too strong puts me off, but the honey cardamom latte was delicous! I can taste both the honey and cardamom and it's a lightly sweetened latte - delicious. 

The hazelnut latte is amazing - I did not regret my decision :) the latte art is beautiful, and it comes with some nutella glazed around the edge of the cup. together with the latte. SO GOOD. if you are craving a chocolate-type of latte, this one def. hits the spot!

Here are my thoughts on the brunch items:

Pharoah Po' Boy: Pita sandwich with garlic mayo and battered shrimps. If you like anything related to seafood/shrimp, this is it. I LOVED IT. They come in two halves of a pita, and although presentation looks small, it is DEFINITELY FILLING. I was surprised how full i felt just eating the first half! The shrimps are nicely sized and lightly battered, so it wasn't super heavy. the Mayo is such a delightful companion to the battered shrimps. I definitely would want to come back and eat this again in the future :)

Mind-blowing chicken: I can see why this dish is so famous. First bite in was PACKED WITH FLAVOUR! I loved all the sauces that came with the dish, and the burger bun that's hidden underneath and also toasted on top goes really well with the dish. the portion is HUGE! We had trouble trying to finish it - my friend ended up skipping the pita bread from the Pharoah Po'Boy because she was so full - she did end up packing some of the mindblowign chicken home too and I myself had a plateful of the chicken!

Cairo Classic: A healthier spin on a traditional breakfast.. basically an Egyptian Breakfast. I loved the pita bread with the beans and boiled egg. I'ts delicious! simple but loved the flavours. It also comes with a small salad on the side :) The beans are nicely cooked - the texture is lovely and spread that on the pita along with a piece of boiled egg. The falafel on the top of the dish... WOW. it is freaking amazing! Next time I want to get the falafel dish :)

All in all, this is definitely one of my top brunch places here in TO now and I can't wait to come back again!!! But if you go, do expect a line - by the time I went by Mahas a few hours after i ate there, the line looked like it's over an hour wait. But I will tell you this - the food is worth it :)"}
{"text":"Just tried out Maha's based on several yelp reviews and this place did not disappoint. We started with the babaganoush and fresh pita bread and they were both phenomenal. For mains we went with Maha's mind blowing chicken and the po boy and they were both very good but the cumin fries we ordered with them were fantastic. Great little resto and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Been here twice and both times got the same items:

- appetizer platter
- shrimp po-boy 

Both were incredible. The appetizer platter had a little bit of everything, served with their fresh bread. It's definitely something I'll order every time. The shrimp po-boy was also amazing. Crispy, juicy shrimp in their fresh pita bread with the best sauce. We shared both items between 2 people and it was the perfect amount. 

I'll be going here again and again, even if it's a little outta the way for me to get to.

The only thing that sucks is the wait, but that's the case for most brunch places in Toronto. The first time I went, it was a weekday so there was no wait. The second time was a Sunday morning and we waited over an hour, but it was worth it in my opinion."}
{"text":"I love Maha's!  The only reasons I'm giving it has 4 stars instead of 5 is the location and the long line ups, I wish they had some sort of system where you didn't have to wait for over an hour most of the time. (it's still worth it though)

Aside from that, the food is amazing. My friends and I come here often and have tried almost everything. The sandwiches are all so good, the po boy is my favourite, and the eggplant one comes at a close second. Their appetizer platters are perfect if you're a group of 2-3+. For the non-sandwiches, their basturma scramble is my go to (but I'm a huge egg lover), and the shakshuka is highly recommended too. 

Their drinks are top notch, the cardamon latte or the cortado are my favs. 
As for the deserts, I wasn't a huge fan of the knaffeh but their small date rolls are addictive. They're TOO good. 

Also something to note is the vibe of the place. It's family owned and you can tell how much passion Maha has put into each dish, her children work there too and they are all so friendly and kind. They make you feel at home. 

Prices are not high at all, especially for what you are getting. 

Will always come back here."}
{"text":"Mind. Blowing. What an amazing meal - Maha's deserves all the stars on Yelp, all the praise already garnered from blogTO, and so much more. I'm glad we had a chance to come here and experience Maha's brilliance for ourselves!

We arrived on a Saturday morning for brunch at 9:25 AM, and it was already packed. We were told it would only be a 30-40 minute wait but, turns out that a table for 2 was available sooner and we only waited about 15 minutes! Not a bad wait at all for a table for 2. Although, note that if you're with a bigger group, the wait can be longer - seating is super limited, and there was a group of 4 who had been waiting over an hour!

Food is fresh and the hot drinks were so wonderful. We ordered: a) the Sunny Eggs and Foule ($11), b) Maha's Mind Blowing Chicken Sandwich ($8), c) a small Honey Cardamom Latte ($4.25), and d) a small Egyptian Black Tea with fresh mint ($2.50). 

First off, the drinks were amazing - the tea tasted so fresh and the mint really gave it a nice kick. The latte was also very soft and smooth, without the burnt coffee bean aftertaste I was afraid it would have. The beans used were top notch. Next... the food. Wow. So unique, so tasty. Both dishes were absolutely fantastic and you can't go wrong with either. The chicken in the sandwich was full of flavour, with a great combination of seasonings. The Sunny Eggs and Foule was very light but filling and an absolute pleasure to eat. The home fries were super soft, light, with an earthy and lemony taste to it - everything was spectacular, and our meal couldn't have been better.

The restaurant is very small and seats no more than 20-22 people, although even that might be pushing it. But, the place is absolutely charming, eclectic decorations (some of which came straight from Cairo), and a wonderful rustic yet family-friendly ambiance. 

Service was also so incredibly friendly - thanks so much to Mark and Hannah for being so warm and welcoming.

For two people, with tax and tip, our total came to $38. A super unique brunch for the ages - Maha's is a gem, and Toronto is lucky to have it."}
{"text":"Food really is 5/5 but unfortunately it's a small space and wait times are high - even in cold weather! But also, table seating is fully first come first serve and seems irrespective of the number in your party, which was confusing and I think added to wait times when groups of 2 could be seated at 4 person tables. I would not recommend coming in a large group. The falafel plate and the batsurma scramble were amazing. I would definitely come back to try other foods at off hours, early dinner or early brunch maybe."}
{"text":"Another example of why the east end of Toronto has the best kept secrets. 

It's busy here, so expect line ups."}
{"text":"It says a lot about the quality of Maha's wares that I'm giving it five stars, given that we waited for about 40 minutes for a table and then another 40 minutes to receive our food. But man oh man is it worth the wait.

So we decided to start with the hummus and the charred balady bread. Now, I've eaten a lot of hummus over the years. Aside from French fries, it's probably the thing I've eaten the most of in my life. And I think I can say with absolutely no hyperbole that this was the best hummus I've ever consumed. It contained all the hallmarks of traditional hummus and yet was somehow elevated miles beyond every other version you've ever had. It's stellar.

For my main, I went with Maha's Mind Blowing Chicken (\"Maha's sacred marinate, tossed with parsley, onions and tomatoes, served on a toasted egg bun with tomeya, homemade mayo and tehina.\") And while this didn't quite reach the sublime heights of the hummus, this is indeed a mind-blowing dish. The presentation is simply outrageous; it's an egg bun that's overflowing with the aforementioned filling, and while it's perhaps just a little too acidic for my liking, it's completely irresistible and almost flawless in its preparation.

I look forward to returning to Maha's to sample some of their other dishes, though that line-up is admittedly a daunting prospect."}
{"text":"The food is outstanding and out of this world! That's the only way I can describe it. My boyfriend and I came around 12:30 PM and it was extremely busy, which was expected as it was a Saturday. We received our food about an hour after ordering but it was it was well worth the wait.The servers were so sweet and genuine. They truly care about their customers. Portions are perfectly sized and extremely flavorful.

I absolutely cannot wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"Best brunch spot in Toronto. I just love how every dish is shareable because they do not cheap out on the amount of food that they give you, which is so nice. You'll leave this place feeling super satisfied."}
{"text":"- What I have tried: Mind blowing chicken, Classic Cairo and a side of lentil soup
- Food quality: 
          + Mind blowing chicken: was really good. I saw some reviews said it tastes like chicken sharwama in a buns, well it does look like it but it's like next-level chicken sharwama. They mixed the right veggies with chicken and the sauce went super well with it. However, I do admit that the bottom bun was a bit wet since there was a huge load of meat on top. 
          + Cairo Classic: This is a unique vegan dish, and it tasted very good as well. The falafels were crispy outside and had some green stuffs inside which was amazing.
          + Lentil soup: This is the best one out of three tbh. I found that it tastes good when u eat it alone and even better if you eat it with cairo classic and mind blowing chicken.
- Portion: very generous. I'm full with only 1 dish
- Price: quite reasonable, varied about $10-12 per dish, I ordered the lentil soup as a side so it only costed $6
- The place is very small, I waited for an hour on Sat :("}
{"text":"Some decent places have a decent wait. This place has the slowest service you can find in Toronto. Food is alright but 100% not worth the wait on weekends.

Unless you want to spend your whole weekend here, then it's the place for you. A 30 to 45 minute wait really means 2.5 hours until you get to sit, and another half hour for your food.  Good luck.... lol?"}
{"text":"Came here around 10:00am on a weekday with a group of 6 people.  Didn't get seated until everyone arrived. We were lucky that we got the last table before the line up started to build.  Mahas is full of characters, I really enjoyed the decor and vibe.  Seatings are limited, hence the line up.  I would recommend not to bring any backpacks or large bags as seatings are quite tight. 

I have a sweet tooth and prefer something less salty for the morning, hence I ordered the Noah's pudding. I really liked the flavour. Its like dessert for breakfast! 
However I would recommended to get something savory and share the two dishes with someone, as it did get a little too sweet toward the end. 

Overall service n food are both great. However i don't think I would wait for 45+ min as stated by other reviewers. But thats just me with line ups in general :p"}
{"text":"I came here on a Monday at 12pm.  There was no line up.  However, the indoor seating was full and I ended up sitting at their outdoor patio.  

I ordered the Maha's Mind Blowing Chicken and it tasted delicious.  There were large quantity of chicken mixed with parsley, onion and tomato.  The egg bun also tasted very good!  Too bad the bottom part of the egg bun was soaked and I wasn't able to eat it.  

My friend ordered the Pharaoh Po Boy and enjoyed his meal.  It tasted fresh and delicious.  

We also shared the Cumin Home Fries.  The fries was actually really good!  The (turnip?) on it gave it some more flavour.  And it tasted good dipped in cumin. 

I would definitely come back to try more items on their menu!"}
{"text":"Had my first Egyptian experience here, and it did not disappoint! Showed up on a Tuesday around 10:45 and was able to beat the rush. Sat down instantly, served within minutes, and food was brought to the table within another 5 minutes. Friendly staff, cozy atmosphere, and some of the best water I've ever had (yes, even the water was delicious with fresh mint and lemon).

Ordered the Pharao's Po'Boy and it had to be the best I've ever had. Was hesitant when I read that the shrimp was deep fried but it was cooked perfectly, and the sauce was amazing. It was a little smaller than I was expecting, but I was surprised at how filling it was. Finished it off with a fresh brewed coffee which had to be some of the best coffee I've ever had.

Any time I'm working in the area, I'll definitely be taking my lunch breaks here! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"A great atmosphere. Friendly staff. And most importantly delicious food. Their Shakshoka is just amazing!"}
{"text":"The service was kind and attentive and absolutely friendly.

The food was out of this world. Very tasty.

The portions are just right, not overly large, but definitely filling.

The prices are good and very affordable for ppl on a budget. 

The shop was so very cute, bright and clean. I felt right at home.

I will be a regular from now on!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.

On a Thursday at 12:15 we waited roughly 45-50 mins for our food. Luckily we were a party of 2 and the wait for a table was not long. But the wait for food is a little bit out of reason after being seated. I tried to wave the waitress down they tend not to make eye contact and come when they want to serve you.

The food is good. Portions are a good size. Parking near by is also free if you can find one. 

Good brunch place but the wait is seriously outrageous if you come on a weekend. Price is very reasonable too for the size."}
{"text":"Great addition to the neighbourhood. Great food and service. It's nice to have a place that serves Turkish coffee in the hood."}
{"text":"Simple, delicious and fresh! Never tried Egyptian cuisine before but now I'm definitely a huge fan!!! Waited in the cold for 40mins to get in... the cardamom honey latte and mint tea is just what you need after the long wait. The chicken sandwich is a must try, would definitely revisit but in the summer"}
{"text":"Food was only ok, not amazing!! Prices are decent. The latte was great!! 

The wait was way too long....waited 40 minutes for the table for 2 and another 35 minutes for the food. This restaurant is very small, that is why the wait was long. The menu is small and few items, such as the popular dishes like Egyptian falafel and Grilled Cheese, were sold out by noon. After a 40 minutes wait to find out that the popular dishes were sold out...that was a big disappointment. I wondered why the waitress didn't tell us about this when she gave us the menu and only mentioned about the items are sold out when we place the ordered !! 
After all, the Service was great..friendly staffs.

In conclusion, i will not come back to this restaurant again. DEFINITELY NOT WORTH THE WAIT AS FOOD WAS NOT THAT GREAT!! NOTHING SPECIAL."}
{"text":"Mahas is amazing food one of the best Egyptian food ever coffee is a bit expensivethere po boy and chicken sandwich is to die for I am coming back again but the line up is to long the chicken sandwich has really good spices as well as the shrimp po boy but I didn't realize it is so small I could a 100 of those po boys service is good really fast because there is a massive line you have to go there right when it opens because the restaurnat is so small only 24 they should make the capacity at least 50 people so more people can come in and wait less time in line"}
{"text":"A small Egyptian restaurant, although it is not located in a busy area, but the restaurant can get very busy and usually have line up during lunch hours. They don't open on most statuary holidays. Very friendly staff and great service.

Cardamon latte is great, not so sweet, and they create latte art on their coffee to make the experience a little more interesting.The chicken dish and the Cairo classic are well presented, and you will not be disappointed with the texture and taste.

Although Egyptian food is not my favorite choice of cuisine, but their dishes definitely bring back my lost memory since my last visit in Egypt."}
{"text":"One of my favourite brunch places in town (although i could do without the long lines...)

Everything I've had, I've loved. The following items are the most notable:

MAHA'S MIND BLOWING CHICKEN (a must-try)
MAHA'S AWARD WINNING LENTIL SOUP (best lentil soup i ever had)
DATE GRILLED CHEESE (pretty good, but not my go-to)
EGYPTIAN FALAFEL (perfect for take-away)
WATERMELON FETA SALAD (very refreshing)
CHEF'S APPETIZER PLATTER (at times, the wait time on food can be long - this is the perfect thing to order for the table while you wait for the rest of your food)

I recommend going early on the weekends if going through the week is not an option for you..."}
{"text":"I'm not a stranger to long waits at small restaurants because they're THAT popular. I recently went to Maha's and waited for about an hour which was fine (because hopefully the food lives up to the hype).

Finally, when we were seated - tucked away at a corner beside the washroom. It was quite difficult to get any waiter's attention because the restaurant was curved and we happened to not be in the line of sight.

We finally put in our order. I got a honey and cardamom latte, Maha's mind blowing chicken and lentil soup. The latte came pretty quickly but the food took at least FORTY-FIVE minutes. Their excuse? They had a big take out order that they had to take care of before attending to their in restaurant guests.

On to the food and drink. The drink was okay. I know what it's supposed to taste like and it didn't deliver. The mind blowing chicken was not that mind blowing at all. The portion was nice and I really enjoyed the bread but the chicken+seasoning was not that special at all. It tasted like chicken from any Middle Eastern restaurants. The best part was the lentil soup. It was flavourful and had a good texture to it.

I wouldn't come back to this restaurant unless if I was paid to."}
{"text":"Sat on the patio (super cute) - the restaurant is on Greenwood, in a residential area so it was very nice and quite. I had the Cairo classic and my friend had the Egyptian falafel. We both enjoyed our meal - both taste and plating was on point. My favourite was the balady bread, and my friend's the soft boiled egg. Service was quite good as well. The restaurant's also pretty close to Leslieville so my friend and I walked over for dessert and coffee after."}
{"text":"Nice, small, cozy place, with Egyptian decor and items everywhere. The clay water dispensers are a cool touch. Tight floor space, but seating is efficiently arranged. Depending on when you go there might be some wait time and sometimes they run out of items, suggest calling in advance. 

Shrimp Poboy - Fried breaded shrimp, packaged in a pita with various sauces and toppings. Overall good combination, my only gripe is that the shrimp was a bit over-fried. 

Hummus with Flatbread - The hummus tasted great, nice creamy texture with flavor. Finished the ramekin clean. Comes with flatbread but recommend ordering another one. 

Chicken Sandwich - You probably seen the pictures on Instagram. I honestly couldn't figure out how to pick it up and eat with my hands as a regular sandwich. The plate was covered with chicken and toppings. Thing tastes great. Summery, tandoori-ish, fresh, green taste that works. Would recommend this over the shrimp poboy. 

Overall good refreshing food, nice clean environment, great staff. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Delicious fresh food. Amazing brunch spot. Get there early for no wait and great service.

For the last few months I drive down Greenwood to get to work, and I kept noticing that there was always a lot of people inside this place Maha's. Even early weekday mornings. It prompted me to eventually look it up and find that blogTo had rated it best new brunch spot and it had favourable reviews on Yelp. This is for a reason because the food is great.

I've never been to Egypt, so I'll assume its pretty authentic. We both got the Sunny Eggs and Foole after I had trouble deciding. But the waiter's description of the oozing eggs into the fava beans had me sold. There is a nice acidity to the fava beans. They have tomato in them, which might be it, and maybe a little lemon? Either way they mix wonderfully with the fat from the egg yolk. The bread was to die for. It tasted like if naan and pita had a baby, and I was letting it play in my mouth. The salad on the side is nice for some freshness.

Great and unique food. Reasonable prices. Warm and friendly atmosphere (if you go at the right time). I think I like it."}
{"text":"I went to this place after seeing so many instagram posts on it. The restaurant was east of the downtown core but the commute was worth it! I went here for brunch

Maha's is very homey. The server that we had was very attentive and super nice. He took time to explain the menu to us. 

I had the CAIRO CLASSIC: The foole was very hearty and filling. Foole has beans, tomatoes and onions. I enjoyed it but it wasn't spectacular.

EGYPTIAN FALAFEL: I enjoyed this dish way too much. The crispy Falafel had a hard boiled egg on the inside which was still gooey and creamy. It definitely hit the spots. It was crispy and creamy.

TURKISH COFFEE: I enjoyed that it was strong and different from other coffees that I had!

There was so much on the menu that we wanted to try. When we went there, they ran out of certain items on their menu, such as the Lentil Soup, Baba ghanoush. 

Overall it was one of the better brunches I had in the city!"}
{"text":"I went to Maha's for the first time after hearing how good the chicken sandwich was. Got there at 10:30 and put our names down for a party of four. We were told the wait was about 30 minutes. The actual wait was an hour and a half. Felt very misled about the wait times. 

The place is tiny inside and even with the added patio for the summer season, there aren't many seats to go around. From what I could see there was only 3 or 4 tables for four, and many more for table for 2. The wait time for a table for 2 was much quicker. I would advise against coming as a group of 4. 

The food itself was pretty good. The babaganoush and cumin potatos were really good. THe chicken sandwich was decent. I thought it was good, but the hour and a half wait made my expectations off the charts. It tasted like halal chicken and rice plates you'd get from a cart, but on a bun. The bun itself was very good and was much needed against the saltiness of the chicken. 

Overall, I'd say come early and come in a pair."}
{"text":"I actually anticipated loving this place, but the food was underwhelming. 

We went to Maha's on a Saturday afternoon. Immediately couldn't help but notice how small the restaurant is -- seating looked to be quite limited. There was a lineup of people waiting from the door to the cash register, and all the staff were behind the counter. When we found the hostess (behind the counter), she told us was an hour and a half wait time. She also told us that we \"should come on a weekday\" because it's less busy then. Okay, but we're here on a weekend. So she tells us we can put our name on a list, but just give her a name. She won't call us, but she said we can call her in about 45 mins to an hour. Anyway, so that was kind of weird that they don't call you, but it was fine. We left for a bit, I called in an hour to ask if we could come back and she said yes, we can start making our way back -- so we came back, were seated immediately at an empty table (restaurant looked to have cleared out a lot!) and by that time, it had been an hour and a half, so her initial estimate turned out to be right. 

So a bit of a rocky start but we were seated, and I was very excited to try some foole, something I have been wanting to try for a long time now! I wanted to have the Cairo Classic. Unfortunately, we were told they were out of foole! They cook their fava beans in batches, and had just run out as apparently, it had been an unusually busy Saturday. I was disappointed, but --  no problem, I said, I guess I will have a sandwich with a side of the cumin fries that people rave about. But turns out they had just run out of home fries as well! 

I opted for the mind blowing chicken because I did still want a sandwich, and it sounded amazing. My partner opted for the basturma scramble. Neither dishes lived up to their claims. The mind blowing chicken sandwich looked good, but to me, it just tasted like shawarma. The egg scramble was also your very basic scrambled eggs with a bit of sliced processed meat. I would rate the food a 2. The latte, however, was really good. I would definitely rate the latte a 5. 

It also took about 45 mins for us to get our food. We were hungry by this time. On the plus side, it did give us a lot time to enjoy each other's company in the cozy restaurant atmosphere. The restaurant is quite nicely decorated with lots of interesting pieces of art, and sitting by the window was really nice. Quite romantic to experience this slow pace of life. :) I'm pretty sure that's why Maha's has these long lineups. Limited seating + cozy atmosphere  + great lattes = makes people want to linger at their table, and the restaurant encourages that with what seems like a really slow kitchen staff. However, another plus is that by the time we gout our food, it was well past closing time (5:15ish), but we did not feel rushed to leave or anything. So definitely a 5 for environment as well.  If only the food was better! 

If anybody knows where in the city I can get some foole, please let me know! Thank you."}
{"text":"Such a lovely place. We waited outside for just over a half hour in the snow on a Sunday morning but it was worth it. 

They had a couple of vegan items labeled on the menu. I had the lentil soup to start which was delicious. Then I had the mini pita -- one half filled with foole and the other with taameia (falafel). Both were very tasty. 

Others at the table had the mind-blowing chicken, kebda eskandarani (liver), and the cumin potatoes. I tasted the potatoes and they had great flavour as well.

We also ordered some hot beverages when we first arrived-- I had hibiscus tea while the others ordered the Egyptian black/mint tea and the honey cardamom latte. Thumbs up from everyone. 

I also have to compliment them on their service. I'm not sure if he was the owner, but one of the employees could tell it was our first time there and made sure to tell our waiter to take good care of us. Each person who either made recommendations, took our order or brought food to the table was very kind. I just appreciated the nice atmosphere and delicious comfort food. Maybe I will come back... I don't live around there so it's kinda out of the way.  But well done."}
{"text":"Finally made it to Maha's, after hearing so many awesome things about it for a year now! We really enjoyed our meal, but to my absolute dismay, the Maha's chicken sandwich had sold out, and it was only 4pm when we got there! Whoa! We ordered the Pharoah's Po Boy, the Max, lentil soup and cumin fries, and all were delicious! The flavours are extremely rich, and the enticing music really got me moving in my chair, haha!! GTs all around at Maha's, just really sad I didn't get my mind blown with the chicken - pun intended!"}
{"text":"So happy to find such a fantastic brunch in my new 'hood. Wake up my brain with Turkish coffee with cardamom then dig into the Cairo Classic. Flat bread, falafel, eggs and beans and me leaving with a happy and full belly.

Can it get a little cramped? Sure! But they're getting a lot of buzz and I'm happy for their success. I'll be back again and again."}
{"text":"This is one of the best, hidden gems for brunch in Toronto. I'm almost reluctant to review it because I don't want it to get too popular (kidding).

While visiting Toronto for TIFF, we met a friend for brunch since time was limited. He suggested a place in his neighborhood and it was this place! From what was described, it sounded absolutely delicious, but we were warned the wait can be a bit of a thing. The nice thing is our friend could be seated before we arrived! The line out this place is ridiculous. They seat based on who arrives first and you can sit inside or out. The inside is quite small, but the wait is worth it.

Maha's offers up fine Egyptian food for brunch and lunch and many of their options are vegetarian and even vegan. We sat on the patio, which unfortunately doesn't get sunlight so it got a little cool there on a brisk fall-like morning. 

For brunch I went wth the Cairo Classic: fava beans cooked down with tomatoes and onions, hard boiled eggs, falafel, a dollop of cream and then the traditional baladi bread to scoop it all up. This dish was so delicious and quite filling and reasonably priced at $13. You get an insane amount of food. My friend ordered some lentil soup as a side and it was very good from what I tasted.

Where this places loses points is service. It felt like we were forgotten sitting outside and our server took a good 20 min. to deliver our coffee drink. We had to remind them twice we had ordered drinks and they never came. When they did arrive, I ordered the honey cardamom latte which was so delicious, but a touch too sweet for my taste.

All that side, this was a fantastic experience with good food, reasonable prices, despite poorer service. I would recommend this place still and I know I'll have to come back and try other items on their menu!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Maha's! It was an hour wait on a Sunday afternoon but it was worth it. On busy days like this, the staff will give parties of two the option to share a 4 people table with another party of two. Luckily, my boyfriend and I got a two seater table. We noticed how crammed the table of four was.. especially with everyone in bulky sweaters and jackets. 

It was my first time having Egyptian food so I didn't know what to expect. We ordered the popular choices such as Pharaoh's Po' Boy, Cairo Classic, Mind blowing chicken and the cardamom latte. The menu description for Pharaoh's Po's Boy was \"deep fried baby shrimp in mini pita\" but the shrimps were big and not mini. I believe we had 4 shrimps each and they were all perfectly battered, seasoned and fried. This was one of my favourite dish! Everything we ordered was beautifully plated, portions were huge and the sauces and flavours were all surprising in a good way. I'm not familiar with the spices they use but I can tell the staff are precise and attentive to creating that perfect sauce and flavour to suit the dish. 

As we left around 2:30, the line outside had doubled in size! There's a reason why this place is so popular. I'll be back to try some of their other dishes!"}
{"text":"The wait time was long but definitely worth the wait! It's a super busy place and very small, but very cozy and nicely decorated! Nice for a small group of 2-3 people. 

My friends and I had the Chicken Sandwich and The Max and both were very flavorful and filling! The portion size was just perfect and the staff was also very accommodating and friendly. I would like to go back and try some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"Have been here multiple times and I'm never let down by the quality of the food and the ambience of the restaurant. The feeling of being in an egyptian-home environment makes the experience that much better. The quality and taste of the food never let's me down. 

The only thing I could suggest they improve on is their service during their busy times. It tends to get busy especially around lunch time, which then extends the wait time to receive your food. I totally understand it but if it is busy as it is (everyday) then more time and effort should be invested in order to be prepared for busy times and ensure that all the customers experience a fair and great experience. No one likes to wait long for food but no one should wait longer than expected."}
{"text":"Maha's is a slice of Egypt in Toronto's east end. An awesome byproduct of globalization.

It's a very cosy (read small) place, so it gets packed quite quickly. By 10 am the line was out of the door. The staff are very friendly  and the decor pays homage to the hosts' Egyptian lineage.

The Cairo Classic with beans, tomatoes, onions, hard boiled eggs, falafel and delicious bread is ridiculously filling but unfortunately quite limited in taste. Because the portion is so big, getting through the dish can seem like a chore towards the end.

The cumin fries while decent could've been more flavorful. I also ordered the Cardamom Tea,  a couple cookies and a vegan sandwich for friends, who all reported that the food was ok. Apparently the cardamom tea somehow tasted bitter.

I enjoyed my time at Maha's primarily because of the ambiance, experience of a slice of Egypt in Toronto and the sunny day."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food! Excellent service! Recommend the basterma and foole and eggs plate. They have so many great dishes."}
{"text":"I came across a recent BlogT article on this place and the pictures and description of the food got my attention. My husband and I walked into the cozy place off Greenwood on a Saturday (11 am) and were advised right away by the most friendliest guy whose mom and sister were busy \"beeing\" in the kitchen that it's going to be a 45 minute wait! Four couples also walked behind us and gladly accepted the 45 minute wait. As the aroma of out of the world dishes and authentic Egyptian spice hit our senses, we understood why Maha's (Egyptian Faire) which just opened less then a month ago is going to be one of the \"IT\" bistros of 2014-2015!!

We started off ordering the hot drinks. I ordered the Cardamom and honey latte, which took me back to my trip to Egypt. The aroma the taste was out of this world! The cardamom seeds crunched in my mouth as the honey soothed my tongue. My husband ordered the Turkish coffee, which we were told in advance took 10 minutes to make. The verdict..the best authentic Turkish Coffee in town! 

For our brunch items I ordered the Cairo Classic (flava beans, boiled eggs, falafel and dalop of home made feta and balady bread)   my hubby got the Basturma Scramble (sliced beef in Egyptian spices clarified butter and eggs); Verdict, true Egyptian cuisine worth the 45 minute wait!

We left the bistro feeling happy and satisfied while planning our next trip to the Red Sea!!!"}
{"text":"Waitress was very pushy and not helpful at all, but the food made up the entire experience. So delish!!!"}
{"text":"Don't be discouraged by the long weekend brunch line up if you are a party of 2.  My sister and I came here on Saturday around 11:30, we saw the long line up and almost left but so glad we decided to stick around and wait. There were 9 parties in front of us but luckily they are mostly party of 3 or more.  This is a really small space so half of their tables can only accommodate party of 2's! In fact, their entire patio only sit 2's so lucky us, we only waited for 20mins. 

I've read a few reviews on Yelp complaining about the long food wait or bad service and I totally disagree. All the staffs were very attentive and friendly. Our lattes came within 5 mins and food came within 15 mins.  I had the sunny foole and for a person that doesn't like beans, I almost finished my plate!  The foole was very flavourful and fun to scoop with the bread. The honey cardamon latte was as good as people had described, slight hint of cardamon with just the right amount of sweetness. It's different and you probably won't find it else where so I strongly recommend you try it. 

The only reason I gave it a 4 star is because I felt really cramped in my chair.  My chair backed up to another chair so I wasn't able to move the entire time. Also, we were seated near the washrooms so it wasn't the most pleasant dinning experience."}
{"text":"First time trying Egyptian food and it was very tasty and flavourful. Tried the Cairo classic and the date grilled cheese. There was a good variety and had vegetarian and vegan options. We were asked to share a table with two other random people which we didn't mind since we already waited 1.5 hours in line with a good amount of people in front of us. The restaurant itself is on the smaller side but very cosy! Also tried the honey-cardamom latte which was warm, lightly sweet and filled the aroma of spices"}
{"text":"Had the sunny eggs & foole w/Turkish coffee.

Food is very good!!! The place is small but lots of light. It is pretty full with locals as of 11am. I think that says a lot. The Turkish coffee is delicious & I could have 3. Yummy smells wafting from the kitchen...Egyption music in the background...I will be back :)"}
{"text":"If you live in Toronto, I am surprise if you haven't been because you are missing out a lot. If you are visiting, make this part of your itinerary because it is worth it. Be ready to wait for a while but you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is a great brunch spot but if you're not going to be there from door opening you've got to expect to wait 30-45min to get in as the place is pretty small. BUT the wait is worth it!

The mind blowing chicken was delicious! Think shawarma plate but on a brioche bun

The pudding was a nice sweet end to the meal and I'm surprised it hasn't gotten more love in the reviews. The pistachio , Walnut and coconut combined with the berries make this dish a winner

The honey cardamon latte was different from what you usually get from a coffee shop and the taste of cardamon is layered into drink well but some may find it overpowering

Cumin home fries were excellent

Overall it's great food at a good value, if you come expecting to wait in line then you'll just have the food to look forward to and you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"I love this place. Best thing to happen to Greenwood Ave. The food is excellent. It makes up for wacky (although very nice) service by the guys there, and having to wait for a table. And the espresso drinks (if you're particular) are not great.
Favourites: Pharough's Po-Boy sandwich, lentil soup with date grilled cheese sandwich... Actually, everything food-wise is delicious. And design-wise, it's sunny and fresh in there.

UPDATE: I go there as often as possible - and can say that I'm not sure what I was complaining about with the espresso drinks when I originally wrote this review. The honey cardamon latte is the best!"}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 3/5
This place is located on Gerrard St E. No parking in direct vicinity, so we parked on one of the side streets. There is an inevitable lineup, but the line is a tad shorter before and after the brunch rush. We waited for approximately 45 minutes. 

[SERVICE] - 5/5
Our server was amazing and made us feel like we were guests in his home. 

[DÉCOR] - 4/5 
Very small, comfortable, and felt like we were in an Egyptian family's home. The only downside of such a popular but small place was the wait-time for seats. 

[QUALITY] - 4/5
Patience was a virtue because each dish was made with high-quality ingredients, and the flavours went very well with one another. 

[ORDER] - 4/5
- Maha's Mind-Blowing Chicken - $14.00: Chicken literally exploded out of the bun, and was topped with a rich tomeya, homemade mayonnaise, and tehina. The bun underneath the chicken was a little too soggy, but the bun on top was toasted very well. 

- Egyptian Falafel - $14.00: When I cut into the Falafel wraps, I loved how the soft boiled egg oozed out of the crispy case. The cumin home fries were addictive and the salad created a nice balance for this hearty dish. 

[OVERALL] - 4/5
Definitely worth the wait time. Portions were large, and worth the value. Besides the soggy bun in the Mind-Blowing Chicken, our order was phenomenal and I would recommend this place for authentic Egyptian food."}
{"text":"i won't have to say much since there's consistent reviews about this place being a small restaurant with long wait times and lack of service, but sometimes good food makes up for all of that. highly suggest coming here on a weekday if you can - we lucked out with zero wait time on a monday mid afternoon!"}
{"text":"If you're coming here for weekend brunches, expect to wait 60-90mins. Really cute little shop that is family run. You can tell the authenticity of the food and decor by looking around. 

Food wise, we got the mind blowing chicken and shrimp po boy sandwich. There were a lot of other cooler items on the menu but my friends and I somehow ended up with more classic items. The chicken was great and flavorful but it was not something super unique. The shrimp po boy was excellent, not too greasy and fried just perfectly. They were generous with the shrimp as well which is a bonus. 

As for beverages, honey latte is recommended. Provides a unique twist that I haven't seen elsewhere.

Overall, yes, worth the visit but if you can avoid it, do not come during the height of brunch hour during the weekend. 

Parking tip: side street or at one of the nearby plazas."}
{"text":"Not sure what more can be said about this place that hasn't been said already other than wow!  I rarely line up for my meals but since we came all the way from Richmond Hill to try this place, we decided to stay.  We waiting for over an hour and I have to admit it was worth the wait!!!

It was a perfect weather day and were lucky to get a seat on the tiny patio. A carafe of water with fresh mint was waiting for us.  Our server was a young lovely girl but she seemed flustered and overwhelmed.  If you adjust your expectations about the service, you will enjoy the experience more.  

We ordered the pharaoh po boy, the beet salad and the mind-blowing chicken sandwich.  None of them disappointed. The beet salad was amazing - it had just the right amount of fresh herbs and acidity.  I could eat it every day.  The Po Boy was good but the chicken sandwich was truly the star of the meal and is a \"must have\".  Apparently they don't offer it for take out so wait in line you must.  

The cardamom honey latte is worth the hefty price tag ($4.75 for a small).  Next time I'm getting my own and it will be the large size (for $5.50).  I was worried that it would be too sweet but it was perfect.  

We also ordered the Egyptian black tea with mint which turned out to be delicious and a wonderful palate cleanser.  

My bf and I shared all of the food and felt comfortably full but not stuffed  when we were done.    

I only wish they had another location closer to home."}
{"text":"Two trips to the place already and have yet to try the mind-blowing chicken. 
But went for brunch both times and opted for breakfast items. 
The Egyptian Falafel made even boiled eggs fun with an awesome mayo-based sauce. The side potatoes go well but is a pretty huge portion overall. 
Must try the cardamom latte; even though the larger size is just cents more than the regular and practically double the quantity, I always go for the regular sized because it's a heavy drink. 
Yes wait times are super long BUT last time my fiance and I got lucky and on account of being a party of two were bumped up as we agreed to share a table with another couple. Miracles do happen."}
{"text":"Absolutely excellent. Service, price and most importantly taste!!

Went for brunch. Grilled cheese, Cairo classic and the scramble! All fantastic.

Get the hummus to start and a latte!!!"}
{"text":"What a lovely place. Maha, the owner and chef, is so hospitable and friendly. They serve tasty food in a cozy and authentic atmosphere. The staff is efficient and the food is fresh, homemade and delicious. I had a Pharaoh's Po Boy shrimp sandwich and it was one of the best seafood sandwiches I've ever tried. I can't wait to go back and try something else on the menu. If you like middle eastern food and happen to be in the neighbourhood, DEFINITELY check out Maha's."}
{"text":"I went to Maha's because of the absurd amount of Instagram hype. Seriously, this is such a foodie hot spot! I waited in not-so-great weather for an hour and a half, and was quite underwhelmed by the service and the general feel of the interior (very small - but not cozy, more like cramped). The food was definitely above average - quite delicious, actually! But it wasn't life changing and it doesn't rank in my top 10 in the city...so, I would not say it was worth the almost 2 hour wait."}
{"text":"Best part of being jet lagged is you automatically wake up early enough to not have to line up for brunch! Got here a bit before 9am and had about a 15 min wait? Which wasn't so bad at all.

Maha's Mind blowing chicken ($14)
Marinated chicken mixed with onions, parsley and tomatoes drizzled with their homemade mayo sauce. Served with buns but there's so much ingredients you can't even see the bottom of the bun. Look at the amount of chicken they serve you! It's ridiculous. I only managed to finish like half of it. Was tasty! I feel like the sauce made it taste extra filling, there was a lot of sauce drizzled on top so it was quite saucy.

Cairo Classic ($14)
This was more of a traditional Egyptian breakfast. Consists of beans mixed with onions, tomatoes and with slices of boiled egg and a piece of falafel. Comes with pieces of charred balady bread. Tasted really strong in bean flavour, but I suppose that's expected.

Oh, the vanilla latte was REALLY good! 

Was my first time having Egyptian breakfast. Was an interesting experience I will say. Not sure it's my type of food but I definitely enjoyed my meal."}
{"text":"Amazing!

We waited about 30 mins on a Sunday morning at 8:45am. Outdoor heating lamp was greatly appreciated. When we did go in, servers were pleasant and very helpful. Food was amazing, ordered the Cairo Classic, Mind blowing chicken, Egyptian Falafel, Basturma eggs. Had the honey cardamom latte and Egyptian black mint tea. Everything was perfectly seasoned and extremely tasty. 

Completely worth the wait and trip. Couldn't ask for a better experience."}
{"text":"very tasty, fresh and well prepared items, with generous Portions, in this family owned style restaurant. 
there is often a line as the place is relatively small."}
{"text":"My husband and I drove over yesterday (Saturday around 8:30am), and the place was packed with a wait of 45 minutes. We left, and drove over today (Sunday at 8am), and we were the first people there. The place was packed up by 8:30am, and the wait was an hour for other patrons.

We were quickly seated and given the menus. We ordered the Cairo Classic, Basturma Scramble, Babaganoush, and Honey Cardamon Latte.

The Cairo Classic was amazing, the falafel was fluffy with a crispy exterior, the fava beans was melt in your mouth, and the baladi bread was to die for. You can taste all the fresh, hearty goodness from the dish!

The Babaganoush was by far the best Babaganoush I've had!! My favourite was from Me Va Me, after trying this, Maha's makes the best Babaganoush! It has such a nice smokey flavour, and the texture is nice and creamy, and it taste hearty and refreshing! I can eat a bottomless pit of this Babaganoush!

Honey Cardamon Latte was really good, even though I don't drink coffee. I tried a sip from my husband and the Cardamon with the honey was so good and soothing. Any latte fan should definitely give it a try!

Overall, we will be back soon! The service and food are superb!!"}
{"text":"Chicken sandwich is awesome. Eggs and foule too! Coffee is good, little on the acidic side but does the job."}
{"text":"Great food, great value! A bit of a wait but it's worth it. A quaint little joint. They use fresh ingredients and create some very nice dishes."}
{"text":"This place is one of the best restaurants I've been to, ever! The hour wait was also totally worth it. Even though their little patio was opened, there was still a long wait and that's how you know they serve good food. I got the Maya's mind blowing chicken and wow the presentation was seriously so beautiful! The cliantro added color to it which made it even more appetizing yum. The dish overall was a solid 10/10 as I was also hungry and the ingredients were fresh. My friend enjoyed her dish very much as well. We shared the home fries and at first I was iffy about it but it was really good, seasoned well! I can't wait to come back here and get the same dish again haha."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurant in Toronto. Since this restaurant is pretty popular, there was line up when we went there. But it didn't take that long to have our seats. Cozy and comfortable place. Staffs were friendly. I will come back to try another one soon!"}
{"text":"As an authentic Egyptian cuisine, this place should be your destination. A freshly made food which is genuinely authentic, that taste so good will leave you craving to come back for more all the time.
The only downside of this place is that it's a tiny place Dino's we to the number of customers, so be prepared to line up for up to an hour or more sometimes and I hope they can find a bigger place.
I personally  will come back here anytime I crave Egyptian cuisine, you too should give it a shot. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"If I could I would give a zero star. The food may be delicious here, but unfortunately the horrific \"don't care\" attitude soundly ruined this place for me. I was truly looking forward to trying this spot. But after being told it would be a 1 hour wait, waiting for 1.5 hours and then being told it would be another 45 minutes (maybe, we don't know) we just left. I should add that people were waiting 45-60 mins for their food. We went to Brickyard Grounds* cafe down the road and it was amazing (see that review)...  I might go back to Maha's to try the food in the future at an 'off' peak time... But not for acouple months (let them dirt out their new resto logistics). Meantime, I'll just go to my mom's place for a real Cairo meal without the grief and 4-5 hour investment.

*Brickyard had the same number of guests and tables, and we were having our delish food in under 15 mins! Wonderful service too."}
{"text":"GOOD THINGS COME TO THOSE WHO WAIT!!!

My friends and I had to wait about hour before we were seated. The inside of the restaurant is beautiful: it's homey and cozy without feeling stifling. 
I had the chicken and it's a huge portion. I could barely finish it. The food was amazing! The service was great as well."}
{"text":"Amazing food and friendly service, although the line-ups, especially on the weekends, are ridiculous."}
{"text":"Finally, I got to eat at Maha's!! 

I thought it must be my lucky day as with a party of 2, we were seated right away in the patio area during a late lunch on a weekday.

Unfortunately, we ended up waiting 1 hour for our food after placing our order. The kitchen seems to have problem copping with the extra orders/customers with the added seating. We did not wait in line for a table but ended up waiting for the food. At least I could chill out at our table and sipping on Egyptian Mint Tea while waiting.

Cairo Classic ($13)
- love the different element on the plate as one can have a taste of everything!
- highly recommended especially you are dining here alone

Maha's Mind Blowing Chicken ($12)
- love the fresh ingredients and use of herb seasonings! 
- chicken has a nice smokey flavour 
- big portion but got a little boring about eating half of that, great for sharing!

I love mint and I really enjoyed my Mint Tea and the fresh mint in the water they served.

I do love Maha's small neighbourhood cafe vibe but is popularity might be it's downfall. I do know good food needs time to cook but 1 hour wait for food + the potential of another 30+ minute wait for a table?"}
{"text":"Me and my partner love this restaurant. It is very far to get to from core downtown but it was a very authentic and enjoyable experience.

My only negative comment was that the location is ALWAYS packed with people and it can take SO long to get seated. It took 45 mins to an hour to get seated. We walked around the park across the street while we waited.

The food is very good and the serving size is sure to get you full. It is a family restaurant and is very authentic in terms of the flavours and the atmosphere. My partner got the honey cardamon latte and was blown away. Everything is very well priced in the $10-$20 range. I would love to go back every weekend if I lived closeby and could get a seat easily."}
{"text":"\"The Cairo Classic ($14), number one on the menu, came highly recommended and every ingredient spoke to my growling stomach. It was the best in the house, uniting foole (a stewy mélange of fava beans and spices), with tomatoes, onions and thinly sliced hard-boiled eggs and a falafel. Charred balady bread was the perfect vessel to soak up every last drop of the foole. A sibling of the pita, balady is a flatbread that's made with whole wheat flour in scorching-hot ovens in Cairo's bustling markets. At Maha's they prepare an incredibly authentic variety using a piping hot oven and a baking stone, lending to its faint charred flavour. It was supérbe! And the salata balady, much like a Greek salad, provided some healthy crunch...\""}
{"text":"The food is prepared well and the place is cute, quaint and appealing to the eye. It's family owned and you can really see it with all the culture they've infused into the business itself as it looks like a second home.

Start with a drink because you'll need something during the wait for your food. The honey cardamom latte is permeated with cardamom. The honey sits afloat and you taste it every sip. You could also try the Egyptian mint tea prepared sweetly with sugar and fresh mint leaves.

What I love is that their dishes consist of simple ingredients and extraordinary flavours. That's my favourite type of breakfast. The Cairo Classic is a staple - both hearty and wholesome with fava beans, falafel, boiled egg, and pita. It sounds simple but the spices and ingredients take it to another level. The arnabeet is my favorite and contains fried cauliflower drizzled with sauce in a pita. Swap out the traditional home fries for some cumin fries because I couldn't get enough - they're seasoned so well! 

The date grilled cheese is either love or hate. If you like a sweet note near your cheese you should try this. My recommendation is to get the lentil soup with it because it's very good and something they're famous for. On the other hand, the mind blowing chicken sandwich was flavored well but didn't live up to its claims. That little egg bun trying to contain all the marinated chicken is just as bad as me trying to contain the girls in a tight top on a night out - it just ain't happening. It's filling but it didn't floor me like the other dishes.

As much as I love their food, they have very long wait times. It ranges from 45 minutes to 1.5 hrs on a weekday to get a table. Service in the restaurant is also slow - you're looking at an hour or so to get your food. I hope they get the wait under wraps because that's the only thing keeping me away."}
{"text":"The good:
Creative menu. Fun ambience. Decent food, prepared with love.

The bad:
The wait. Uggh. Told us 45 minutes for brunch, took 90.

The ugly:
Nothing really."}
{"text":"*Expand for tips* I finally paid this place a visit and was naive enough to think I can avoid the line up on a workday (Friday) for brunch at ~1:30pm but boy was I wrong... 50 mins in line. They have very limited seating hence the long wait. I hate to say it but it was so good and worth the experience that we went a second time in the same month! But instead of brunch, we went for Linner (Lunch/Dinner) and much better! The food is really comforting and something unique beyond the usual egg's Benedict for brunch. I love it but cilantro haters beware as they generously use it on a lot of their dishes. 

*Tips/highlights
- Check Google to see how busy before visiting
- If I had to rank all the main dishes I've tried top to bottom: Mind-blowing chicken, Cairo's Classic, Basturma Scramble/Egyptian Falafel  
- Mind-blowing chicken is easily the best value for money dish, very tasty and can probably feed 2! Very indulgent and saucy though. We actually like eating the saucy soaked bun at the end. 
-  The falafel dish is interesting but, I'm not a fan of eating a whole plate of fries. I like the \"falafels\" on it which is like a hybrid of a scotch egg and falafel. So yummy!
- Love the artichoke salad and lentil soup! There are refills on the coffee they provide! We ordered the lentil soup both times. (They do take out of the large lentil soup if you're too full to fit one in)
- The dessert menu is minimal, serving baklava-like pastries. It was decent but nothing special. I would skip dessert here."}
{"text":"I had the Cairo Classic ... An protein rich super savoury most enjoyable breakfast ever.  I don't live in the area but made a special trip when I was in town based on a friends recommendation... Waited in line and was not disappointed.  Try something new and don't be afraid to ask questions, everyone is so friendly and happy to help.   I will be back!!"}
{"text":"First the food is really really delicious....  BUT customer service needs lots of work! I was charged for something I didn't order and they were not even understanding and still charged me for it! Ounce I got the order I told the waitress that it wasn't what I wanted,  she simply shrugged her shoulders and walked away!! Also the first time I went there I waited almost a whole hour to get my dish! 
Definitely will not be going back!!"}
{"text":"I thought the date grilled cheese was a seller but truly, their secret sandwich hit is the Eggplant in a pita! I paid $6+tax and i swear i would have paid double! Taste is wonderful, something quite hard to recreate and also healthy and Vegan! And, my 'non-vegan' friend loved it too. Excellent service too"}
{"text":"Maha's was super delicious. And I can say that having gone with an Egyptian, who gave the place two thumbs (way) up. That's a verified review, right there.

Three of us headed to Maha's for a late weekday lunch. Much to our surprise there was a 40 minute wait; PEOPLE OF TORONTO-EAST WHY ARE YOU NOT AT WORK? jkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjk; I'm not hating, I just wanted a much more efficient line to getting Mind-blowing Chicken IN MAH MOUF. We happily waited for a table, though it would be nice if there were more space for people to stand around. As it is, Maha's is incredibly cramped.

The space itself is bright and homely; colourful kitsch from Egypt decorates the restaurant. I found the chairs to be fairly uncomfortable...rickety and tough to relax into. Doubly problematic was that there was just one bathroom stall for everyone; this is proportionate for a restaurant of this (small) size, but I anticipate that a bathroom expansion might be appropriate should Maha's popularity continue to soar.

So that last paragraph was the only constructive feedback I have, because the rest is all: NOM NOM NOM. We had some beautiful foul, complemented by some tangy lemon. A side of pickles was not just delicious, but a treat for the eyes as it was so artfully arranged. The basturma scramble featured thin slices of beef scrambled with eggs, which was both flavoursome and surprisingly light. The star of our table was the po'boy which was deliciously soft bread stuffed with perfectly (10/10!) battered and fried shrimp. We washed it all down with some guava juice, imported from Egypt.

Affordable, friendly, cheery, and something new on the Toronto food scene. We all enjoyed it very much, and I only wish that I had more room for either the lentil soup or the honey cardamom latte. Next time!

Yelp note: it's not \"fast\" food, as it's all prepared to order. That fact + the wait to get a table made Maha's quite a long lunch, so budget time accordingly!"}
{"text":"After hearing so many mixed reviews about this restaurant, I had to try it myself. 

Upon arrival, we had to wait about 40 minutes, which I heard isn't bad! People I know that have been here said they waited around 1-2 hours. The weather wasn't bad, so we didn't mind at all.

The restaurant itself is super small! There's hardly any seating inside (I mean there is, but it's not spacious as most restaurants), however they do have a patio. The staff here seemed nice. Our waitress was really kind, however the service was a bit slow.

The food was AMAZING! True, authentic Egyptian food. I had Maha's Mind Blowing Chicken and wow it was so good. I've never had anything like that. The portions are huge, which is a plus because it isn't expensive. The only downfall is that you have to wait SO long to receive the food! We waited nearly 45 minutes just to receive one dish, which was disappointing.

All in all, I definitely recommend this place if you want Egyptian food!"}
{"text":"After all of the IG pics that I have seen on my feed I finally got the chance to try this place and it definitely doesn't disappoint.

Had their mind blowing chicken sandwich that definitely live up to its name.  It's one of the best sandwiches I've ever had and paired it with a honey latte which was also good.

Definitely coming back to try the rest of the menu!!!!"}
{"text":"Explosively good restaurant in a quiet neighborhood. The only reason this restaurant isn't 5 stars is the wait (30-40 min) and the service is quite slow. With that said, onto the good stuff!

Food: sizeable portions. Delicious and authentic Egyptian food. Quality ingredients in their food. You can just tell they spend a lot of time adding the herbs and on the presentation. We got the hummus, the chicken sandwich (more like a shwarma plate) and Cairo special (highly recommend). 

Coffee: this deserves its own category because their latte art is unreal. The honey cardamone latte is the best latte I've ever had. Mix of spice and sweetness and the small is really big too!

It's a bit far but it's definitely a cute brunch place."}
{"text":"they don't take reservations anymore but there is a lineup now which is much better. we waited like 45min in front but by tume we ordered and while we ate and paid noone was in front anymore so it all depends on luck. food is delicious, prices are a bit high for our budget but still adequate, this is not your random family restaurant or burger joint. interior and atmosphere are great and food came quickly."}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?!

The mind blowing chicken!! I thought it was so good I went WOW. Bursting with flavor and spices, the chopped chicken pieces were not dry at all. And can I say the plate was overflowing with foood?!? Huge portion too! 

I think all the entrees we ordered tasted amazing though! Not just the mind blowing chicken, the omelette was good too!!! Called the basturma scramble, the thinly sliced cured beef is what made the scramble tasted absolutely incredible. 

The pita that came with the dishes tasted moist and chewy, not dry and thin at all. Complemented really well with the dishes we ordered! 

The restaurant is family owned (a mom and two siblings) and the food is what the family grew up eating so they brought these wonderful tasty dishes over from Egypt. 

It's not a very big restaurant (can only sit 24 ppl) so don't come with too big of a party or else you'll have to wait quite a bit of time for tables to open up to fit your party!

LAST TIP?!

Be prepared to wait in line because it's always busy but people wait in line for this restaurant for a reason! The wait can be up to 40 mins or so and some can get in as fast as 10 mins. They dont usually split the total in separate bills so if you want to split the costs, they will split the bill based on how many people are at the table so just note this if you like separate bills when you go dine."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for brunch a few months ago on a Saturday. It's quite a small place with only a handful of tables. We came during prime brunch hour and were told the wait was going to be 20-30 minutes. It ended up being over an hour... which is quite a long wait. Good thing I wasn't that hungry when I got there, otherwise I probably would have gone somewhere else. 

Once we were seated though, everything was fine. The food was great and the service was friendly! My friend and I shared the Cairo Classic and the Date Grilled Cheese, and had a Honey and Cardamom Latte to drink. They were all very good and I would recommend all 3. 

This would've been 4 stars, but -1 for the wait. Tip for brunch: go early!

Taste:  4/5
Service: 3/5
Atmosphere: 4/5
Value for Money: 3/5
Would I come again: Yes"}
{"text":"Had a really nice brunch at Maha's. Great atmosphere - the space is sunny and bright with plenty of windows; arabic music plays in the background and lends some nice cha character. It was a bit of a wait to get in, but during a sunny Saturday brunch, to be expected. Food-wise, we'd never had Egyptian before, and my friend and I were not disappointed in the least. Our meals were both really tasty (I had the sunny side up eggs on beans, with lovely spices and warm, fresh pita; he had the scrambled eggs with pastrami, also well-spiced). The honey cardamom latte was delicious and had a really unique flavour. We treated ourselves to a dessert at the end of the meal - a square that I believe had a custard base, and a flaky top reminiscent of baklava. Sweet and indulgent.

The whole experience was warm and relaxing, and just a treat. Service was good. It's off the beaten track, but I would definitely come back/recommend."}
{"text":"Maha's is SO worth it. I arrived at 1:24 Monday afternoon and was seated around 2. I was a party of 1 though so I got to skip the line a bit. I ordered their Egyptian Falafel and the Honey Cardamom latte that everyone raved about. My food came out after about 20 minutes. Im not even a coffee drinker but I would come here every day for the latte alone. The Egyptian Falafel was AMAZING, the potatoes were on point not to soggy/potatoey tasting but not overly crispy either. The egg in the falafel was something I had never tried before and I loved it but probably could do without whatever the white sauce is on top but it didn't mess up my meal at all.My meal also came with a side salad but I could've done without it. I definitely plan on visiting again and trying some of their other classics."}
{"text":"I don't venture out to this part of town very much but was very glad that I had a chance to try the famous brunch at Maha's. The place is simply adorable.

I started off with a honey-cardamom latte. It was certainly a unique beverage and I'm pretty happy that the spice was not overwhelming. 

I had Maha's mind blowing chicken and it was absolutely delish! It's actually a sandwich but it's definitely more of a fork and knife kind of plate. The flavours really packs a great punch! I took home half of it as leftovers and it made a great lunch the next day with some rice.

Be sure to come early as a line is to be expected (they don't take resos!) I would definitely come back in the future to try out their other brunch items!"}
{"text":"Mind you the line was long but it was definitely worth the wait; It was a 60 min wait on a Monday.  I ordered a mint tea and their famous chicken sandwich, it was amazing! The crunchy onion and citrusy tomato went great with their chicken. The sauce brought everything together. The mint tea was a very nice addition to help contrast the richness of the food. Last but not least love the sweet tasting and soft egg  bun."}
{"text":"This place always has such long line ups but is worth the wait! I think everything on their menu is absolutely amazing however my top choices would definitely be the Egyptian falafel and the grilled cheese with dates with a side of lentil soup. For drinks, I absolutely love their hazelnut latte as it's rimmed with Nutella. However, their honey cardamom latte is also good."}
{"text":"Love this place! One of my favorite brunch spots in Toronto and it's reasonably priced! Be prepared to wait in line though.. they are popular! 
We got the hazelnut latte, falafel, side potatoes, chicken sandwich , and the shrimp pita. Everything is so flavorful and portions are perfect for sharing"}
{"text":"My friend took me there last week and I simply can't wait to go back and take people with me ! 
First she insisted that I should try their coffee ( I'm a tea person ) and I'm so happy I did ! The coffee with cardamom and honey was Sooo good . And then I tried the falafel and the date grilled cheese sandwich .

The food was amazing , the place is uniquely cute and tiny and the staff are super friendly . 
Just keep in mind that's it's a very busy place . We went there on Thursday morning and still had to wait 20 minutes to get a table . But that wouldn't  keep me from going back !"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to go to Maha's for a while and I'm so happy that I finally made it! I honestly thought that there would be more vegan options, but there were a lot of vegetarian options. In saying that, the vegan option that I got was amazing! You can see how good it looks in the photo, but it honestly doesn't do it justice bc the food was actually amazing. I would really recommend it!"}
{"text":"Hands down best restaurant in all of Toronto. Everything on their menu is delicious and the honey cardamon latte is amazing. Just make sure you get there early on the weekend to avoid a 1-hour+ lineup."}
{"text":"The waiting time is pretty long (50mins) but worth it!!  We got Cairo Classic and shakshuka. Tomotoes, onions mixed with soft fava beans, take a big spoon of that plus a big bite of balady bread, sooo good!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday around 2pm and there was no wait for a table. Read a lot of reviews about extremely long waits, was glad there wasn't a line. But and its a big but, the Mind Blowing Chicken was all sold out ! According to one of the waitresses it's because Monday is almost the end of inventory time, they will restock in the next day or two. Was a little disappointed but at least no line up ! The service was superb, all the waitresses were caring and helpful.

Ordered the Cairo Classic and the Pharaoh's Po Boy, thought that wasn't going to be enough for two so added a side of Cumin Home Fries. The wait for the food was definitely a long one, almost half an hour. The time seems to be random, as the table beside got their food in less than half the time. Everything was delicious and tasted very fresh. The home fries were small pieces of potato served with a aioli sauce. They were different from other brunch places but was much better. There was a lot of pita, in almost everything on the menu, which is what was so filling. Only negative comment is everything on the menu seems similar, variety is not their strong point but taste definitely is.

Overall, will definitely come back to try the Mind Blowing Chicken and to feast on Egyptian brunch !"}
{"text":"Maha's is one of Toronto's hidden gem and worth the trek to the east side of the city. Here's why the trip is worth it:

1) Egyptian falafel: If you like Scotch eggs, you'll love this! You'll get two soft boiled eggs crusted with falafel making the combination of flavors out of this world.

2) Location: It's just outside of Little India. When you're done, stroll down Gerrard Street taking in the sights. 

3) Honey Cardamon Latte: The happiest barista will hand craft it for you and it's amazing.

There were only two downsides: 1) The cafe itself is small so expect a wait and a crowded (and at times community shared dining) experience. 2) The Maha's mind blowing chicken was good, but not mind blowing."}
{"text":"I ordered the honey cardamon latte which was excellent, and the Egyptian Falafel which I was disappointed when I laid eyes on it but after tasting it, the flavours were wonderful. I don't think it was worth $14 for 2 eggs stuffed in  falafels but the spice and flavour makes up for it. IMHO I won't get this dish again but I was glad I gave it a try as a I love falafels. I would definitely come back for the lattes. The reason for the 3 stars was the service. I had to ask for the menu after I was seated for a while. No one took my order or brought me water until I called someone over. My table wasn't hard to miss as it's right in front of the register."}
{"text":"The food is just tasty and authentic. Order the Cairo (as pictured) and it was full of flavour and fresh. The lattes there are as well yummy - the hazelnut latte is really good but really sweet.

Heads up though - the line up is quite long. 2 of us went on a Friday lunch time and waited about 30+ minutes. The space doesn't have a lot of table to seat guests."}
