{"text":"One of my favorite places for pork bone soups, dumplings and pan cake with chives and eggs. Don't order anything else. Utensils can be dirty. Service can be slow. Don't expect friendly staff there. You get what you pay for !!!"}
{"text":"It's run by Sino-Korean from China (Harbin?).  The owner speaks very fluent Mandarin and Korean.  Most of the \"Korean\" dishes have hint of Chinese to it.  The \"wonton soup\" is similar to Korean  (dduk-guk) but with the Chinese dumplings.  I liked it.  And their  (cold noodle soup) is fairly good.  Actually it's awesome.  I never had anything like it before.  It's similar to ChosunOk  but different.   Can't quite place the taste but I am addicted it now.  We usually order the fresh noodle (kinda like jjolmyun - ).  (It costs $1 more, but woth it.)  As for the dumplings, they are fairly good.   Washroom is in the basement: not recommended. :(       for the value, it's prob best bang for the buck.  Nicely served dumplings in large bamboo steam trays.  They remind me of Korean run dumpling places in Harbin or near North Korean border.  Seafood soup was ok.  Ja-jang-myun () like dish was ok, but a bit too greasy for me.  Mostly I like their vegetable dishes...  Not your usual Korean Resturant in the GTA.   If you're expecting Korean Restaurant, try others...  but if you want some interesting Sino-Korean Fusion taste, this is the ONLY place I know in Toronto."}
{"text":"Oh how I've missed Dumpling Village since I moved away from Toronto.  Love their celery steamed dumplings, eggplant with fish flavour, and cold noodles!!  The eggplant makes me come back time and time again and the prices are great too!  The Korean pork bone soup is also superb!  A few things that bring the rating down to 4 stars: the service is terrible and the atmosphere gives the impression that things aren't so clean.  Still love this place and visit it every time I'm back!"}
{"text":"The restaurant serves Korean/Chinese food . They are dumpling are very big and cheap( $4.99 for 14 pieces)!This is my favorite dumpling place to eat dumpling. the pork bone soup is very good and big. The cold noodle soup is so so good! because i'm not really like cold noodle. the staffs are very nice so it's very good and cheap place to eat ."}
{"text":"The hot and sour soup is really good! Great dumplings with great price!"}
{"text":"Dumplings are good, satisfying and SUPER cheap. Not as high quality as nearby restaurant xiao long bao. Not as much soup."}
{"text":"I use yelp all the time to find restaurants but have never posted before. My experience at dumpling restaurant was so bad that I finally signed up to share what happened.   First off, entering the restaurant, the manager is at the counter on the phone, and doesn't even look up to acknowledge the guests as they enter.   Our server was typical for this type of establishment, so no issue there.   We ordered 5 items for our family, 2 of which were actually decent. But 1 item was so off putting that the rest didn't really matter, and here's why. We ordered the pork and pickled Cabbage dumpling and was appalled after just 1 bite. It was foul. It left a garbage taste lingering in our mouths that we couldn't get rid of (imagine the smell of stinky tofu, but in your mouth). We waved down the waitress to let her know and she said that's how pickled Cabbage tastes like and walked away... Really? The many other dumpling houses in scarborough/Markham certainly don't taste like garbage or over fermentation.   I'd like to extend an offer to this waitress and the owner to try the 2 other dumpling houses just beside them and tell me that, that's how pickled Cabbage is supposed to taste like.   IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO TASTE OR SMELL LIKE GARBAGE!   After taking that 1 bite, we just lost our appetites and asked for the bill. When the waitress came to our table to collect our money, she didn't even bother saying anything to us about the 13.5 out of 14 pcs of dumplings left untouched at our table.   There are literally 5 dumpling houses within 5 minutes of this property. Do yourself a favour and venture into one of those."}
{"text":"I have been here on a few occasion prior, but decided to write a review about this place. Got here for lunch with my Dad, and ordered their #1 and #2 for dumplings steam. First one was their standard pork, cabbage and other stuff in it. Second one had shrimp, chive, egg and other stuff. Between the both of them, I prefer the shrimp one for sure. Both dumplings had juices pouring out when I bit into it, so it was enjoyable moist dumplings.   Also ordered the pot sticker chive one with pork that came with 5 pcs for $3.99. This one is tasty, but I prefer the one at Dumpling King for sure. I also prefer the chili sauce that's offered at DK!  Our last order was a noodle dish that represents Shanghai noodles, but this one was a miss. Did not taste that good, and was quite boring and bland to look and taste. Bill total to $26 before tips.  I guess I would come back here just for dumplings, but that's probably it."}
{"text":"Decent Northern Chinese type of food.  Dumpings, pan cakes, buns, etc.. as well as some Korean dishes.  Cheap and good dumplings. Leeks and Porks ones are my favourite there.  The Korean pork stew dish is quite good too, although wouldn't be a dish you'd eat in front of a date as it can be kind of messy. Another one of my favourites is the tinfoil wrapped beef with onion pancake. The service is fairly fast and the ladies there are friendly.  With their recent renovation, it makes the place feel much cleaner than before."}
{"text":"Like any typical chinese place, this restaurant has a lack of service. Waitresses can be slow and may make a few mistakes with your order but food here is decent for the cheap price; especially so if you love dumplings! I ordered some dumplings, the egg and chives pancakes and a pan fried pork & eggplant dish to share with another person. We ended up having so much food that there was leftovers and we were stuffed full when leaving. It was totally worth going home with chive breath."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a hidden gem located slightly east of Midland Ave. and can easily be driven by if you aren't paying attention!  The tip off is that there is a 2-4-1 Pizza on the corner for you to turn in.  I love this place and cannot think of a better value for one of my favourite things to eat in the whole world.  Everytime, we have relatives coming up from the states, they always want to come here (and my stomach is more than willing to oblige!)    The restaurant offers a mix of Chinese and Korean food.    Now this place is called Dumpling Village for a reason.  We always enjoy getting the assorted as it has a mix of different types of meat and vegetable dumplings.  The longer pan fried dumplings (comes in 5) and the smaller dumplings of 15 are also nice and doughy and made fresh to order.    The meat rolled in an onion pancake is excellent as it is always very very tender with a light sauce.  I love the fact that they will always try to cut it into the appropriate number of pieces so that everyone at the table gets one.    The Korean Pork Bone soup is an excellent choice for the colder weather.  I have to admit that we don't order the Korean food as much since I am too busy stuffing my face with dumplings.    For those a little more adventurous, the egg white dessert filled with red bean with a light coating of sugar.  Careful, this is really HOT when it is served so wait a bit before biting into this.    Here are some tips that I have learned in the many many times that I have eaten here.    This place does take reservations so don't hesitate to call.  This is especially advisable if you have a large party since they don't really have that many tables that can seat 8 or more.    The waitresses are generally always the same 3 people.  When it is busy you will have to flag them down to get your teapot refilled or to even get your complimentary kimchee and bean dish.  Don't be afraid to stick-your-hand-up-in-the-air like grade school to get their attention.    They will leave on vacation and the WHOLE restaurant is shut down. Nothing is more disappointing than being ready to eat and finding out that they won't be back for another month.  This past year, they were gone for all of February and have been known to take the odd week as well.  All the more reason to call than risk disappointment!"}
{"text":"Pretty good, the waitress kept hinting at a tip from the beginning to the end of the meal, which was pretty annoying. But the food is spot on, probably will come back."}
{"text":"Two of us walked in at 9:40 on a Sunday. They close at 11. The waitress looks up from her cell phone, unimpressed, and asks: \"seriously?\". Confused, we ask if they're still open. She says yes and we grab a seat. We were still trying to decide if we wanted to put that rude comment behind us and just order when she dropped and broke a bowl. Took that as a sign. We said goodnight, and left to go search for food and competent service elsewhere."}
{"text":"Oh. My. God. It's now my favourite (Asian/non buffet) restaurant in Toronto. I've been there 3 times now.  I'm northeastern chinese and the food in this restaurant really suits my family's taste! Apparently the boss lady is a korean chef who went to china to learn about chinese cuisine, and combined the two flavour profiles together. Anyway... good portions and really tasty food! I would go back if I am near the location!"}
{"text":"Well I searching for a dumpling place and this place had some awesome vegetable dumpling. Truly enjoyed it !!"}
{"text":"Would give 0 Stars if possible.  Regularly shop at King's Vegetarian in this little plaza and decided one day to try the Dumpling Restaurant next door.  We liked the dumplings.  They are good quality.  We initially thought that we are going to return.  Although the place did not look particularly clean in that dirty dishes were not cleared, and service not friendly, we were still going to return until we got the bill.  It was simply a piece of paper with a total amount!!!  No itemization, no tax, AND it was wrong.  Several dollars over what it should have been.  We questioned but got no satisfactory answer so we did not feel liking fighting so we just paid what they asked and decided never to go back.  If you want dumplings, try New Northern Dumplings on SilverStar.   If you are willing to pan fry or boil or steam dumplings yourself, you can get fabulous dumplings in the 4385 plaza.  The Store is at the far end of the plaza from the Dumpling Restaurant.  You will see three or four staff preparing the dumplings on large tables and it is super clean.  The dumplings are really good.  We will never never return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"It's official. This place makes me weak in the knees. One of my best food discoveries of 2013!  Went in today, and got my regular order of Pork/Chive and Lamb Dumplings. Excellent as usual. Filled with tender meat, and flavourful broth. Once dipped in the Chili/Black/Vinegar/Soy provided at the table, it's over. Like, pack your bags and go home over. SO bloody good!!  Decided to explore the menu a little more today. We had the Kimchi Fried Rice with Pork. I am not a fan of Rice, but this was the best fried rice I've ever had in a Chinese restaurant. So flavourful, and the rice had a nice bite to it.   The Fried Noodles with Seafood were a revelation. Someone in the kitchen is hand-pulling those noodles yo, and I've got to give them major props! These couldn't have been any more perfect. They had a perfect chewy/al-dente quality. And the smokey flavour from wok-frying was dope. One of the best noodle dishes I've had in a long time.  Also have to give a shout out to the Deep Fried Lamb with Cumin. This was just melt in your mouth good. So tender, and delicate. The cumin just added the right amount of earthiness to the dish, while the chill hinted at a bit of zip. I would order it again for sure!  I've been here about 6 times now. Is it too early to say I'm in love? Am I just lusting and confused? I don't know. But I have a feeling that this infatuation won't be ending anytime soon.   In the words of Biggie Smalls (kinda), your Dumplings just hypnotize me yo!"}
{"text":"Scarborough, Friday Night with hunger pains and Yelp on my Blackberry, The SO and I end up at Dumpling Restaurant.   The patrons were mostly Chinese, although there were some Korean offerings on the menu. Banchan was bean sprouts and Kimchi, the kimchi clearly brought in - not fresh and too salty for my liking. (missed the excellent Kimchi from Owl, or House of Soon)   The server was unbelievably sweet. We clearly ordered way too much and she came over to let us know how large the portions are and helped us take some things off of our list. One order of dumplings is comprised of 14 and costs $4.99. We were thinking 5 bucks would give us 8 dumplings at best and ordered 4 full orders.   Tea was hot and very good.   We sampled steamed veggie and steamed assorted pork dumplings, Northern style Tofu skin with hot pepper (vegetarians take note, there were crumbled bits of meat on top) and snow pea shoots with garlic. The dumplings were a little oily, and my SO commented that the pork was extremely fatty. The veggie were very bland, lacking something, and they did not provide ginger with the Chinese vinegar, which I really missed.   The dumplings were clearly made in house, and just soo cheap.   2 Stars, for the quality of the food, 1 full star for the service and the unheard of 14 dumplings for $4.99. Cash Only."}
{"text":"First time eating at Dumpling Restaurant (very original name). Went in with high expectations and left satisfied.  We ordered the assorted dim sum, deep fried dumplings, Korean fried rice and pan fried onion cake.  Spent $25 for two and had enough leftovers for two.  Food: tastier than I expected. Full of flavours, a bit on the oily side but that's expected. The dumplings were great. Definitely coming back for more. one complaint is that the dumplings were a bit 'doughy' for my liking.  The restaurant could definitely stand for a makeover ... If you're looking for a homely atmosphere you won't find it here! Not a first date spot for sure. If you're at the point in the relationship where anything goes then it won't be a problem;) Wasn't the most pleasant service ... Instead the woman wordlessly pointed in the general direction where we could choose a seat then silently handed us the order sheet and then crept up a few minutes later and took it back.   Try it out!"}
{"text":"Decided to come here on whim when me and my family realized our regular dumpling spot was closed. Dumplings are one of my favorite foods so I'm very particular about my dumplings and I was actually very pleasantly surprised. The dumplings here are fresh, juicy and tasty. You know a dumpling is good when you bite into it and the juices from the steamed filling squirts out. We also ordered the Wonton Soup and it was different from most places make and serve it. Usually wonton soup is basic and only served in  clear broth. However, their Wonton Soup had additional ingredients such as baby shrimp, flour boiled dumpling slices, and baby bok choy with pork and shrimp wontons. The place is underrated and is easy to miss because it's located in a small strip plaza. The establishment is nice and clean. Atmosphere is quiet and doesn't seem to get to busy. The price range is also very reasonable and I do plan to come back."}
{"text":"I like them very much. Decent Northern Chinese type of food.  Dumpings, pan cakes, buns, etc.. as well as some Korean dishes.  Cheap and good dumplings. Leeks and Porks ones are my favourite there.  The Korean pork stew dish is quite good too, although wouldn't be a dish you'd eat in front of a date as it can be kind of messy."}
{"text":"Torontonians need to yelp more! This is my favorite dumpling place to eat whenever I come back to Toronto.  Their chive and shrimp ones and tomato (trust me) steamed dumplings are divine, full of soup and entirely handmade.  Their korean dishes are great too.  I love the cucumber and peanut buttery paste glass noodles and their spicy beet, carrot, cucumber, and mushroom mixed veggie cold dish.  English does not do a good job of describing asian food, which is a HUGE shame because this place is AH-mazing."}
{"text":"I ate the chive and shrimp dumplings at the \"Dumpling Restaurant\". The dumplings were very good and I will go back to try their other dishes.  The restaurant serves Korean/Chinese food and the owners are Korean Chinese.  The service was great and the restaurant was quite clean."}
{"text":"It seems like either Dumpling Restaurant changed ownership or they really started caring about their looks. The table tops are now draped with table cloths and with a hard plastic sheet that's shaped an inch or two too small all around. Even the menu received an upgrade from laminated sheets to an actual folder.   Despite the questionable aesthetic changes, the overall flavour and pricing remains the same. For a basket of dumplings for $6-7 on average, you can't beat a classic in both flavour and value. Coming out piping hot out of the kitchen, the dumplings were scalding hot - just how I like them!   If you are in the Scarborough (Agincourt) area on a budget, this restaurant might be your calling."}
{"text":"My theory with dumpling joints is that the more north of Toronto you go, the larger the portions and the cheaper the bill. Rings very true with this restaurant, tucked away in a tiny suburban plaza. The decor is the standard, if you could call it decor. But you can't go for the decor or atmosphere; it's the dumplings, of course. They're big, juicy, and I can't even finish them in one sitting. They also offer other food like noodles and so forth. The red been pancakes are also not bad."}
{"text":"BEST PLACE EVAAARRR!!  I come here at least twice a week, not even lying. This place is just perfection.   The decor isn't exactly fancy shmancy, but the food makes up for it.  I'm not a huge fan of the Korean food, but mainly the Chinese dishes are spot on. I really don't know what else to say about this place, but ... IT'S AMAZING.  If you haven't been here, you gotta go! You're missing out on fresh, delicious dumplings! Gotta give some love to the fried onion pancake as well!!"}
{"text":"We went around 3pm on a Thursday. The waitress seemed so uninterested in being there. I could talk about the lack of any customer service but I'll leave it at that.   The food was pretty good. I ordered Dumplings, steamed dumplings, sugar pancake, and flower bread( I'm pretty sure there's some translation issues there). One of the bread items was suppose to come with condensed milk, and she didn't bother notifying us until she served the dish. That's what makes that dish. It's like saying that here's a fried rice dish but I forgot to tell you that we're out of rice. :S  Service: 1/5 Food: 3/5 Overall: 2/5"}
{"text":"The dishes showed that everything was cooked after we ordered them...everything was very hot and delicious so the short 10-minute wait was well worth it. The pork potstickers had a very crispy, golden brown side. The pork filling was not excessively fatty and there was a lot of it! It was flavourful even without the ginger, although i did add my favourite vinegar just for my liking. We also ordered the steamed pork and bok choy dumplings. I rarely eat it but I might start ordering more of it. The wrapping was chewy and the perfect thickness. I think the filling was similar to that of the potstickers. Lastly, we had the red cooked beef noodle soup. It is one of my favourite dishes to order anywhere that has it! The flavour is very unlike the Taiwanese style, and tastes more Chinese. I still thought it was yummy though. It had chewy, thick noodles (that we suspect was homemade), large non-fatty chunks of meat, and a few bok choy.   Oh, I ordered the pork bone soup before, and it was not my favourite. It tasted nothing like the Korean ones I usually have, which was kind of expected. It had a lot of meat and potatoes, but the flavour was again, more Chinese.  The most important thing is that this restaurant is very affordable! All the dishes are large in portion and a few dollars less compared to in other restaurants. The ambience is very simple, but the tables are spaced out, quiet and it became cleaner over the years. My family loves coming back for lunch or an afternoon break during the weekend."}
{"text":"A bit of an under-rated restaurant if you ask me! I go here because this place offers cheap, filling and good dumplings around the Agincourt area :) I've tried their chicken dumplings both steamed and pan fried, and the Korean pancakes and pork pot stickers too. All of the items were a generous serving size for an affordable price. A tad bit on the oilier side for the pancakes and pork pot sticker, but still good nonetheless. Definitely recommended for folks who are looking for a budget-friendly meal!"}
{"text":"I've come here with my coworkers several times and the service isn't great. They always seem unhappy and anytime I ask for simple things, they look at me as if I'm asking for the world.   Food is average. Prices are fair. No stand outs. You get two Korean side dishes. Kimchi and soy bean sprouts.   If you have dumplings, be prepared to have stinky breath. There's a couple other items which were really smelly too but I can't recall the name.  Must be super authentic cause I saw some Chinese people ordering it and they seemed to be enjoying it."}
{"text":"All I can say is bad service. Yes this is probably the cheapest dumplings you can find, but is it worth bad service? I used to come here a long time ago then stopped coming because of poor service. I thought I'd give them a try again and it was a mistake. It's just as bad. I'd rather spend my hard earned money where they treat you better."}
{"text":"The dumplings here are okay. Not fantastic, but not bad either. I've had much better elsewhere, including places in Toronto.   First of all, my favorite dumplings (lamb dumplings) turned out really bad... the skins had already broken by the time it was served, so all the soup had escaped. On top of this, the lamb itself didn't taste great and was kind of chewy. For this reason alone, I probably won't be back.   The chive dumplings (another standard order) also didn't taste very good.   The other orders (cumin lamb, \"meat\" dumplings, beef soup) were pretty decent though.   I usually don't care about service (I just want good food), but this cold service was quite obvious. The waitress didn't crack a smile once. Every time she delivered a plate, she'd literally dump it on our table and instantly walk off. Didn't say thanks at the end when we paid the bill. Only gave her a 10% tip (would've preferred to give 0).   Quite a few parking spots  CASH ONLY!!  ps. Not sure if I'd order Korean here. The place seemed very Chinese."}
{"text":"What?!  I didn't review this place yet???   The cold noodle dish topped with meat, veg, and egg, with sesame paste and garlic is totally home-y.  We also like to order the julienned cold potato dish.    The best steamed dumpling is the one with pork, chives, and shrimp.   The pan fried dumplings are very good.  So are the chive pockets.    We don't usually order the Korean food here because the aforementioned dishes can easily feed 4-6 people.  We never leave this restaurant empty-handed.  I don't mind leftovers at all.  :)  Don't use the washrooms."}
{"text":"I love dumplings.  I grew up eating dumplings.    This is our family go-to place for handmade steamed dumplings.  I don't think I've had one I didn't like.  Their side dishes are pretty good too.  You can't beat a steamer of 14 little mouthfuls of joy for only 4.99 or 5.99 depending on the filling.  Dumpling House makes good dumplings."}
{"text":"Excellent value for the food. Unique North Korean style of food. Dumplings all made to order for dirt cheap. Great hidden gem. My go to dumping place"}
{"text":"I was a little concerned about the washroom reviews, as I desperately had to use the bathroom when driving there. They weren't nice but I've seen worse.   I ordered the pork dumplings. $5.99 for 14 very large dumplings! They took awhile to prepare but the waitress brought me complimentary Kimchi and something else, they both were great. The dumplings themselves were good. Very filling and my bill was $6.77 plus tip."}
{"text":"Best value for money on dumplings in the city. Many different style dumplings, great prices, and incredible value.  The ambiance? Let's just say you won't be paying a premium for that. You're coming to this unpretentious joint to eat dumplings, and maybe have the kimchi pork bone soup. If you're game for that, you will be hard-pressed to find a better spot."}
{"text":"Came here for dumplings and they did not disappoint. Their lamb and winter melon soup was surprisingly so awesome, soup lovers should try that for sure  Pro tip: if you get that soup to go, use seperate  containers for the noodles inside. It will expand 5 times like no body's business and absorb your yummy soup. Imagine my surprise opening the lid next morning and looking at a noodle Sahara desert"}
{"text":"Dumpling restaurant, presumably, specializes in dumplings.There are a number of other dishes on the menu, including a set of korean dishes for some reason.  For the dumplings, the standard serving comes with 14 steamed pork dumplings starting as low as $5.99. Compared to other dumpling places I've been to, this is the best deal I've seen so far for cooked dumplings. They also have chicken, beef, and lamb options for a dollar or two more if you can not, or do not want to, eat pork.  There are a couple fried options, which were pretty good also. If you're looking for some fried pancakes or beef rolls, I would also put in a few orders.  Service is quite under-staffed. There's one person behind the counter and one person managing the floor. If you need something you should just go up and ask for it. If you need refills on tea, you will need to ask for refills otherwise they will just walk right by.  We ordered a few non-dumpling dishes, but didn't find them particularly interesting. I would just go with dumpling night and get 10 plates of dumplings for a party of 6. Nothing beats sharing 140 dumplings between 6 people."}
{"text":"If you are expecting great service, this the wrong place for you but, if you want great tasting food, this is the place you want to be.. The rating I gave might be a little low for the quality of food they give there, but good service makes a big difference for me..."}
{"text":"This is a rather less upscale restaurant but I can't complain much because you get your bang for the buck. Decent tasting food (in regards to both their Shanghai and Korean cuisines) for a considerably cheap price! I normally order one Korean pork bone soup because the meat is just so tender and the portion is very filling. The vegetable dumplings are also nice as you get 14 per order and the skin is thin.   I wouldn't bring anyone here to impress them but I would definitely come with family for a cheap and filling meal."}
{"text":"My husband and I are always looking for a great dumpling place and just had to come to give it a try.    We ordered one order of assorted dumplings, the egg and chive pancake and kimchi fried rice. For us the real winner were the dumplings.  The dumplings were huge; huge doesn't even begin to describe it. 14 pieces of absolute goodness. Realllllly good!  The kimchi fried rice was a touch disappointing. I'm used to getting a fried egg on top of the rice and we didn't get that. Barely any kimchi mixed in and it came with shrimp when we had ordered it with pork. Wouldn't order this again.   Egg and chive pancake, we were expecting better after reading those reviews. Ours was far too oily and tasteless. Big disappointment.   At the end of the day, the place is called dumpling restaurant, the name says it all. It's signature food is dumplings, don't have any expectations for non-dumpling dishes."}
{"text":"Okay, so really I give Dumpling House 2.5 stars, but closer to the 2 side than the 3 side.    We ordered the Pork, Chive, Egg & Shrimp Dumpling as well as the Wonton Noodles.  After having read the various reviews about avoiding the Korean dishes, I decided to listen to my fellow Yelpers and we skipped that.  The wonton soup base might as well have been water because it was so tasteless and bland.  The noodles were a udon-like noodle which was the first surprise of this dish as it is not the traditional noodle used in wonton noodle soup.  The second surprise of the evening with this dish was that the wontons didn't have a shrimp filling!  It had a pork filling.  I didn't care too much for the layer-thick wrapper, but the filling itself was quite savory.  Now onto their supposed specialty, dumplings!  The dumpling wrapper is the thinnest and best I've had thus far in Toronto.  The filling would've gone quite well with that bland wonton soup base because it was just as blah.    I think that if the filling from the wontons and the wrappers from the dumplings were an item, it would've been wonderful... but unfortunately, the dumpling genie failed to grant that wish!  A good place to go if you want to fill up fast.  Our bills came to $12.41 for 2 people and the serving sizes were generous."}
{"text":"I am disappointed.   I recently came back to my once beloved dumpling hub with a few friends.  Most of us are returning customers who have had positive experiences here. Also, note that Dumpling Restaurant was at the core of my gastric adventures during university and my Yelp friends also liked the dumplings when I invited them here just a few months back.   I am not sure what happened, but something seemed amiss last weekend.  We ordered the bok choy dumplings, the pork and fennel dumplings, the lamb dumplings, and the pickled vegetable and meat noodle soup. With the exception of the soup, which was flavourful yet light, I was taken back by the dumplings. The dumplings felt a little different. I couldn't put my finger on it, but it seemed like there was less filling and broth inside the wrappers and the bamboo steamers they came in seemed to waft with a funky  scent. Sanitization was never the restaurant's strong point, but I just couldn't let the smell slip my mind. I lost my appetite and I am too wary to return."}
{"text":"We walked in intending for a quick late dinner but didn't even stay to eat or even takeout. The rudeness of the waiting staff was unacceptable. We walked, was laughed at for some strange reason....only when we move to ask if we could be seated, we were told they were closed at 1030pm so no. To our confusion, we came in at 10:10pm was told they closed 1030pm but the outside was listed as closing at 11pm. If we were told politely, I would take an issue but I left super annoyed as the way we were treated especially when we braved a storm to get there. I will not be coming back!"}
{"text":"Great place to come if you want a nice, cheap meal! The only reason I took one star off is because the quality of the food varies depending on how busy the place is. On a quiet weekday afternoon, the pot stickers I ordered were hot and perfectly crispy at the bottom. On a busy weekend, the bottoms were pretty sad and soggy. However, despite these criticisms the potstickers are my favourite and are super juicy! Be careful of hot juices spilling out your first bite. Everything I've had here has been tasty, and everything is so inexpensive (an odd thing is that one time I ordered a bibimbap and they placed the veggies at the bottom of the stone pot and it ended up burning, I'm not sure if this was just a one time mistake, or if they just don't know how to make bibimbap in a hot stone bowl). The interior is not the nicest, and the service is not spectacular but that's to be expected from a typical Chinese restaurant. No complaints here! Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Very busy, hard to get a table at dinner.  Menu is a little difficult if you don't know the cuisine already. My Chinese friends say its authentic. The service is not friendly but typical for type of cuisine, so neither plus nor minus.  Not my usual preference but will come back when in the mood.  The style is Northern Chinese and you may have that particular craving. It will satisfy."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I have been a regular at this restaurant for almost 2 years and it has never let me down. This restaurant specializes in Korean and Northern Chinese cuisine. As the name would suggest this place makes a killer dumpling. My favorite variety of dumpling is the lamb. The dumplings are steamed, the skin is not too thick and the lamb filling comes out perfectly juicy. The juices that are rendered down into the dumpling from the filling are simply to die for and the filling itself is quite good. Other than the lamb I also enjoy the pork and shrimp dumplings. The best part about the dumplings is that an order of 14 will cost $5-$7 depending on the variety.  My other favorite dish has to be their spicy pork bone soup. This consists of large pieces of pork on the bone (from the spine of the pig) in a spicy broth served with some greens, bean sprouts a potato and comes with a side of rice. The Pork bones are meaty and oh so tender, I love their broth because it is one of the spicier broths I've had in a pork bone soup.  This is one of the few dishes that I crave and must have on a regular basis, a healthy portion is about $6.  Other great dishes include the spicy fried chicken, this is chicken legs cut up (on the bone) breaded and fried with red chillies. These are crunchy on the outside and very juicy on the inside with just enough kick from the chillies. The only thing missing from this dish is an ice cold beer! They also have a sizzling rice bowl (bibimap i believe its called) which I've had once and is quite good. Dishes that I have had and was not a fan of include the kimchi fried rice, and beef roll in foil (which was bland and a little greasy).  When at this established don't expect a high level of service, you will be seated given a menu to mark what you want and then your food is brought to you. It is run by 2-3 Chinese women who get pretty busy so don't expect them to ask how the food was or anything. If you require napkins just go up and grab them from behind the counter they won't really mind. The restaurant itself is not the cleanest and is located in a strip-mall off Shepperd ave.  Overall come to dumpling restaurant if you are looking for an amazing home-made meal for under $10 dollars. It can get busy so be sure you have enough time to enjoy your dinner. Also I believe they make their dumplings fresh to order and dumplings usually take a little longer than other dishes to arrive. This place is truly a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"One of those restaurants where everything I ordered was very MEMORABLE.  It's kind of a HIDDEN place in the same tiny strip mall that has had the CHEAPEST (asian) hair cuts for 15+ years if you don't care how you look.  The decor didn't have anything to it, I took a photo of one of the RARE items that make this place indicate any signs of being KOREAN resto as well but now I look at it, it looks like its written in CHINESE.  Fried Dumplings, Steam Dumplings were absolutely a pleasure to consume.  We ordered Battered Deep-Fried Egglants which were nicely crispy and seasoned but eat it quickly FRESH before it gets soggy.  My meal is not complete without a bowl of NOODLES!  Cold Korean Noodle is quite refreshing and had a Medium Boil Egg Half on top.  The photo says it all, just as good as the ones I've had near Steeles/Yonge.  This is one of the FEW places I would eat \"Water Cooked Fish\" because I'm not big on spice.  The dish actually took awhile to come, so we figured that the chef actually went out to get a fresh fish.  Nonetheless the fish was GREAT and the spices wasn't OVERWHELMING.  A non-spicy eater RECOMMENDS it!"}
{"text":"I would recommend this restaurant if you love dumplings. This place offers Chinese and Korean food. I went with a friend, we ordered pork & shrimp dumplings, beef pancakes, and pork bone soup. The food arrived quickly. We want to go back just for the beef pancakes and some other kinds of dumplings."}
{"text":"I'm quite pleased. Dumpling Restaurant has been on my bookmarked list for a number of years, and I've never gone. I'm a sucker for Korean food and a sucker for good steamed dumplings. I have no idea how they came up with a concept to serve both together, but if I can get both, I will do it. My brother wanted to go out for Asian food tonight, so we ended up coming here. At about 7-7:30pm on a weeknight, less than half the restaurant was filled up. There was also a few free spots in their very small parking lot. This works for me. So far, so good.   Then comes the menu. It's one of those ones where you tick off what you want and then hand it back to the server. No pictures, but I'll survive. It's times like this I wish I knew how to read Chinese more so I could (hopefully) have a better idea of what some of the menu items are. It's not that the menu is particularly vague. It's just that sometimes, I'd like to know what kind of fish I'm ordering if I'm ordering spicy BBQ fish. I didn't end up getting my fish, but I probably will next time, and there will be a next time. We ordered, for the two of us, pork bone soup ($6.99), lamb skewers (8/$8.99), steamed pork and chive dumplings ($5.99), and pork and chive pot stickers (5/$4.99).   The lamb skewers were alright. Not the best I've ever had. On the dry side, but for the price, not terrible. I'd rather pay a little more and have them juicier though. I'll pass on these next time.  The steamed pork and chive dumplings had thin wrappers (a plus in my books), and as my brother tried to take a picture of the dumpling he was holding up with his chopsticks, I just watched as juice poured out of it. Juicy dumplings. Also very reasonably priced. I can't remember whether it was 12 dumplings or 15 dumplings. Good stuff.  The pork and chive pot stickers are the long dumplings. At $4.99, they're a good snack/light meal. Also super juicy. Bottoms were nice and crispy.   The pork bone soup, while not quite the flavor I attribute to a Korean pork bone soup, was still tasty, and would satisfy a pork bone soup craving. The bones were very tender. It's a very sad day when you struggle getting the meat off your pork bones. For you soup lovers, there really isn't much soup in this bowl. There are a few veggies and a slice of potato, but this dish is very bone heavy. My brother had two bones, and I had a bit, but the rest of the bones we took to go. They were supposed to go into our small takeout boxes, but the bones were too big for the boxes, so they had to go into a large, rectangular box. They filled up that box. I can't remember if I put four or five bones in there. A minimum of six good-sized pork bones in pork bone soup. Definitely bang for your buck.  Total damage was $30 and change AFTER tip, but before tax. We also had two boxes full of leftovers. There's lots more on the menu I wish I could have tried, but I'll need a return trip with more people to do so."}
{"text":"Some of the best dumplings I've ever had; hand made and delicious. The rest of their dishes are well priced, well made, but the dumplings here are the stars. One of the servers is terrible, another is great. Overall I'm quite a fan of this place and go here almost once a week."}
{"text":"Scarborough's hidden jewel!! I must mention that this isn't 100% korean restaurant and you'll find a difference in some dishes they prepare. To me, it rather reminded me of Chinese-Korean restaurant when I lived in China long ago. Bringing back all the nostalgic memory with quality food with the such humble service at under $8.00!?!? I was confused if I was in dream land! Pork bone soup is simply the must and Fresh Cold Noodle is surreal! Dumpling is just fantastic!! Just go, don't ask, and don't tell anyone :p"}
{"text":"Dumplings are juicy and I enjoyed both steamed and fried dumplings. We also ordered stir-fried snow pea leaves with garlic and deep fried chicken with hot pepper flakes. Snow pea leaves were a bit overcooked, thus too stringy and fibrous. Chickens were nicely cooked. Everything is cheap here without sacrificing the quality of food. Portion sizes are generous too. The place is quite big but I have never seen it being fully packed.   Overall, a good place to grab a quick bite."}
{"text":"40minute wait for food, the restaurant only had 5 tables full.  Service was not very good.  Dumplings were alright but not amazing"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this dumpling place!  I absolutely love noodles and dumplings and this is the perfect place to be! The dumplings are cheap and you get a very generous amount in the steamer. The restaurant is Korean influenced which is why they serve pork bone soup, cold noodles, spicy squid and many more. After you order, you also get some Korean side dishes- kimchi and bean sprouts.  This place is very easy to order since everything is listed out on the sheet and you just check mark what you want. Food comes pretty fast and you just know the dumplings are fresh- not like those places that serve frozen dumplings... The most recent time I went, we finally tried the pork bone soup since we had more people this time, we got 2 orders of steamed dumplings, 1 beef noodle soup and 1 pork bone soup. This was definitely enough for 3 people...I was so full!  In addition, I have been to their first location in Scarborough but I like this one better since it is more convenient to various shopping areas.  I really like this place since you can get best of both worlds- Chinese and Korean"}
{"text":"This is my go-to dumpling restaurant. Of all the other dumpling locations that I've tried, I don't think I've found a place that trumps this place.   I love that the dumplings are homemade and super fresh to order. Also, the size of the dumpling is slightly on the larger size in comparison to other dumpling places that I've been to. In addition, one order of dumpling is 14 pieces, whereas other places usually serve 12 pieces. As well, I like that the dumpling skin is not too thick and is a great balance to the filling.  The pork bone soup was just alright, the soup could have been more flavourful but the meat was tender and juicy so no complains on that front. This dish also comes with rice but we were pretty full from all that dumpling so we just packed the rice to-go--I guess I'll be having fried rice tomorrow.   Despite how busy this restaurant was during a lunch rush, the server was attentive and able to get me refills for my tea.   Overall, the meal was relatively cheap for some pretty awesome dumpling. Would I return? MOST DEFINITELY!!"}
{"text":"Located a little bit off my usual beaten path, this restaurant on the north east side sits in a nook and cranny strip plaza in Scarborough. It's Chinese owned and run, doesn't have the usual flashy or modern signs that most people are accustomed to. Seeing it from the road may be a problem but if you're patient and drive slow, you surely will be able to find it.   Not able to read a word of Chinese, I let my friends order on my visit here over the holidays.  As you can imagine from the name, this place specializes in Chinese dumplings of the steamed variety.  I do not recall the specifics of what was ordered but I do recall it was the tastiest dumplings I ever had. It arrived to our table in a bamboo steamer, filled with dumplings (I think a dozen or so each tray). Upon opening it, the dumplings were steaming hot and looked very fresh.  Waiting for it to cool down for our first bite, we were not disappointed.  The dumplings here are great, comes in various varieties like chicken, pork, vegetables, fish.  Ample sauces like soy sauce, hot sauce, vinegar with ginger was provided.  We also ordered a spicy squid salad drenched in a red spicy sauce that was delicious!  I have never ever had something like this everywhere but man oh man was it good!  Definitely come here for the best steamed dumplings in town!  What about the decor or ambiance you ask? Who the hell cares?  As Anthony Bourdain once said, \"Forget the decor, it's all about the food.\"  And this place definitely is all about the food.  It's a little off the beaten path especially if you do not live in the area, but I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"I have been coming back here a few time since and each time it's been slightly worst. My recent visit was the top that has convince me I'm not going back to this restaurant. I generally have a lot of tolerance for rude service even though I really shouldn't.  We went to the restaurant on a Saturday and it was busy.  I did expect it to be slow (as usual) but not rude.  First strike for me - I asked to sit at the back table and they told me no because it was busy.  We had a party of 4 and the table accommodated 5.  Anyhow, not long after we sat down, someone else (known to the staff) came in (a party of 2) and sat where I had requested to sit.  2nd strike -  Generally you get kimchi & soya beans as starters but this time we didn't so I asked for it.  The first person said they will bring it but never arrived.   3rd strike - When I asked another wait staff, she said ' do I look like I have kimchi'.  We don't have any & it's too busy.  The food which is really why I am tolerant, did finally came but it was not good.  Everything was under seasoned & had no taste.  The dumplings skin was too doughy and thick."}
{"text":"Great place for fast and cheap dumplings. The portions for the dumplings are big and they are at a great value. The pot stickers had a lot of meat but I wasn't really a fan of them. I personally like the steamed dumplings more. I tried the fried noodles and thought they were okay, nothing special. I will return again whenever I want fast and cheap dumplings but I will probably not order any noodles again. I was surprised to see gamjatang here so I may try that next time."}
{"text":"The power of Yelp compels you. As Jennifer noted in her review, you might pass this obscure dumpling house every day of your life and never have noticed it. But search Yelp for dumplings in Scarborough and you'll turn up this sucker and amazingly a couple people have reviewed it.  By 7 pm Saturday this place fills up (don't let Jennifer's typical empty restaurant photo fool you) with a mix of Chinese and Koreans (based on a visual sampling of the newspapers patrons were reading). A sure sign. I was the only honkey (\"ko jang eee\"[1]) in the place but my lone arrival caused the staff no consternation, hand wringing, or sucking of air through the teeth. Everyone seemed to speak good English.   The menu is in English (with typically overtly literal translations) and Chinese. Despite being Koreanized Chinese food and Sinotophied Korean food, there was no Korean on the menu. The menu offers a good range of dumplings. Interestingly prices can be very deceiving (in a good way) and the uninitiated might tend to over order as prices are incredibly low. As Jennifer notes, you get over a dozen over-stuffed dumplings for $5.   The kimchi fried rice (kimchi bokumbap) was pretty sub par. Jennifer noted while we planned this impromptu 2 person \"Elder Statesmen of Yelp\" UYE  that Koreans do weird things to Chinese food but I'll offer Chinese do weird things, and little justice, to some basic signature Korean dishes. Avoid this one (ie the kimchi fried rice... NOT the restaurant) for sure. However, they do up the cold buckwheat noodle soup (neng myun) right. Korean Chinese or Chinese Koreans tend to hail from the North Korean border region and this soup is a signature dish from that region. Like the massive bamboo steamer of dumplings, the soup came out in a huge bowl with enough for three and also rang in at about $5.  Service was quick. Food came out with little delay. And table service seemed to avoid Korean service rules (if you want something, flag your waiter down, otherwise it's assumed everything is copacetic).  Really, if you want to fill two people quickly and cheaply, Dumpling Village is your oppa. Damage was $21 with tax and tip and food packed up to go (\"kudurap da restup\" [2])  ------------  [1] Korean slang for whitey... meaning \"big nose\". [2] Korean for doggy bag."}
{"text":"Hidden Chinese Gem. \"Dumpling Restaurant,\" You would think the marketing tactic and point of differentiation is more evident. Googling dumpling restaurant, you can probably come up with countless searches well before this, simply because the name is jaw-dropping and outstandingly unique. That said, you'd be surprised at how tasty the food is, contrary to what it's boring signage would suggest.   Service is not ideal, decor isn't exactly luxurious and up-scale, I'm really selling this aren't I? But the food and the price point? My goodness it's so worth the unequivocal stark contrast in service, decor, and signage.   The steamed dumplings contents within are flavorful but not overpowering, the skin is just the right thickness, and coming out of the stove at the right time, it makes any living being salivate. My parents would always pre-order 200 frozen ones to go because that`s how good they are. The fried meats are tangy, crispy, yet filled with tender meats within. Sided with a cold dish that is refreshing, this meal is a big win for quantity at a very descent price.  Close your eyes if you`re someone that enjoys lounging in up-scale ambiance, but this place is a must try if you`re in the area. Worst case is you don`t like it, but it definitely doesn't make a dent in your wallet. So why not give a safe bet a chance?"}
{"text":"My second visit to this restaurant in the last week. This is the only dumpling restaurant I've seen that sell chinese dumplings with Korean food.  I have an assortment of Dumplings from pork, minced beef, mushroom, bok choy, vegetables, chicken, lamb. Apart from the pork, I've tried most of them. They are juicy and amazing.   Their stir fried noodles was kinda bit oily. Also tried their lamb skewers on the second visit. It was a bit fatty but probably not the best but can't beat $8.99 for 8 skewers.   They have other things I'll like to try, but I think they are the best for the dumplings. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"great food but a bit dirty if you ask me.  i have been here many times and on my first time i was here i found something disgusting on the floor which i cannot say here.  i have not seen the same thing again since that day and i have been back here many times.  the service is okay.  the food is piping hot.  you get a mix of korean and chinese food here.  the menu is not very helpful, no pictures.  they use english but it's not very helpful in describing the item.  everything is good.  even the appetizers.    this place may be a bit hard to find since it's set inside a smallish plaza off the main road."}
{"text":"Came here for dumplings a recommendation from a friend. Besides Chinese they serve Korean as well.   Ordered pork with chive dumplings, veggie dumplings and lamb skewers. To finish off I had the caramelized sweet potato. Once you place them into water they harden and caramelize. Not a lot of place serve this dessert so I had to get it.   The dumplings are quite good and the lamb skewers were okay. Love the caramelized sweet potato."}
{"text":"Small place with limited parking.   They have a varied dumpling selection for good value - 4.99 for 14 steamed dumplings. Their pan friend dumplings are crispy and juicy. However, the scallion pancakes are rather bland though the texture is good. I also tried their Korean cold noodles which they claim are made in house. The noodles are chewy and have a hint of sweetness and horse radish which I enjoyed.  Though the food was good, service was slow and the fables were dirty. Some of the chairs seem to lack support and you just sink in. The day I went wasn't particularly hot, but there doesn't seem to be much ventilation. The heat and humidity from the steamers in the kitchen carried into the dining area which was slightly uncomfortable for us."}
{"text":"Dumpling Restaurant (what a generic name!) is a must come everytime we're in TO. They have good sized portions, tasty food, and inexpensive! What more can you ask for?!   We decided to get : Kimchi Fried Rice  Stir Fry Beef & Onion Young Pea Shoots (super good!!) Hot & Sour Soup Potstickers Assorted Steamed Dumplings  Everything was solid - customer service is typical for an Asian place and enough parking to go around!"}
{"text":"Love the steamed dumplings that were prepared!  14 dumplings for $4.99 - can't go wrong there.  It seems like a small family-owned restaurant.  The food was good, but there were not enough servers to go around to handle the busy atmosphere.   So expect customer service to be slow."}
{"text":"This is another adventure based on positive Yelp reviews.  This restaurant has the most  unapologetic upfront English name.  Its speciality is dumpling, and it makes dumpling numerous ways, using nontraditional ingredients, such as zucchini and tomato.  Despite the name, it also makes noodle, rice and Korean cuisine.    I ordered 1 dozen of pork and leek dumplings.  The dumplings tasted alright: the skin was thin and secured, the dumplings were fresh.  I didn't like that the pork inside seemed very loose.  The pork of the dumplings I have had before is packed together.  Service was efficient and friendly.    The restaurant is hard to find; it is so hidden that I drove past the mall twice.  Inspite of this, customers kept coming in during my short 30-minute stay.  Overall, 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"I find the quality of the dumplings here is not good, and it is especially so at $6 a dozen.  The meat inside was loose and tasteless.  The dumpling skin was thick.    Last but not least, the ladies washroom was filthy.  The washroom needs a through cleaning.  An average gas station washroom is cleaner."}
{"text":"A wonderful and extremely reasonably priced restaurant --you really get above and beyond what you pay for here.  Recommendations: All sorts of dumplings of course, including:  - pork & sour cabbage dumplings are excellent  - likewise are pork & mushroom dumplings  - spicy lamb dumplings are my absolute favorite  They also have a variety of cold noodles, crispy shrimp, crispy eggplant, all of which are worth ordering!"}
{"text":"Did I not review this place???  Geez...it really must have not been very memorable one way or the other.  :p  All kidding aside, I really didn't see what all the fuss was about for their dumplings.    My husband and I are dumpling lovers and we've gone to our share of dumpling restaurants and this place really is sub-par.  The dumplings were just okay and their noodle soup which resembled Kal-Gook-Soo, was just as \"meh\" as the dumplings.    The confusion as to whether they were serving Chinese or Korean cuisine was settled almost immediately when we tried their banchan.  Yup, there was nothing Korean about their flavours.  Nor were the dumplings distinctively Chinese.    I'm really not sure how I feel about this \"fusion\" Chinese-Korean food but I doubt that I'll be making my way back here again.  If I wanted Chinese style dumplings, there are far better places to go (try the northern Chinese resto in Metro Square by IBM) and for Korean food, I'd rather swing by In-Chon house which is just around the corner."}
{"text":"On the outside the little plaza looks pretty crummy and small but don't let the looks throw you off. When you get inside it is quite spacious and I was really surprised how many customers they had. After looking over the menu I can see why this place is so popular. The prices are rock bottom, dirt cheap, super bargain. Cash only though.  I ordered a pork bone soup $5.99 and a beef pancake wrapped in foil $4.99.  The pork bone soup was super overflowing with huge chucks of fall off the bone meat. Soup was scolding hot and not overly salty. The beef pancake was filled with shredded beef and there were some chucks of fat which I was not a huge fan of. Overall the food was very good and portions super huge.  The place was clean and service was fast. Parking can be a problem since the lot is so small but there are plenty of neighbouring lots where you can park and just walk over.  And don't be intimidated just because its a Chinese run place. The menu has English on it as well and you just check off what you want to eat. That simple."}
{"text":"Came in here the other day with my partner. As we arrived the waitress stood up from eating at the table and had a serious amount of food in her mouth, while she was asking us \"for two\"? Kinda gross but whatever. As we seated ourselves I couldn't help but notice the sanitary state of the place.  Food was under the tables, my fork had some unknown substance stuck in between the teeth. That's ok ill use my chop sticks!  We ordered  1 iced tea 1 pork pot sticker 1 pork,shrimp,egg,chive dumpling  The food wasn't great but not bad. The potstickers came in 5 with a thin shell and beautiful crusted bottom. The dumplings came out very piping hot and fresh! I liked the dumplings the most. Everything came up to 15.00 tax included. We both left full, and satisfied. I'd come back if I had a craving for dumpling only."}
{"text":"Times like this I wish I were blind or poorly sighted...this place looks worse than a hole in the wall...smells \"special\" when you walk in and honestly...if city inspectors aren't retardo..this place I think would definately be closed down.  The washroom is absolutely filthy so please pee in a cup if you must go or wear depends when you come....I promise..you will thank me for this advice.  It really made me want to throw-up when I went down there and how unclean it was.  I wish there were portable showers cause I felt so dirty when I came out of there....  Anyhow...onto the review.  As I was saying...if I were blind or poorly sighted...this place would be awesome!  From price to taste to service...it was all pretty bang on.  The portions were large and the food was just delicious.  We had the pork bone soup, dumplings of course and beef  wrapped rolls.  I have to say...when we first walked in...expectations were at 0...and then BOOYA!  food was fantastic.    Although I expected to get food poisoning or see a rat run across the floor and the building to collapse at any moment....none of these things that my wild imagination dreamt up happened.  We left very satisfied and a smile on our face.    We will be back...but likely for takeout.  Not sure I can handle the sight of this place...maybe I'm just a snob... :(  I guess I'm more high maintenance than I'm willing to admit...."}
{"text":"This place gets super busy even at 9pm on a Sunday! They serve large portions for very reasonable prices. $8 for 14 dumplings, $7 for veggie plates that typically cost $9+ at other places, wow amazing. Service is pretty standard, we had no problems and our food came reasonably fast. Tons of large tables too, so it's great for groups. Be aware, it is cash only!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a while now because of the glorious reviews on yelp. We got here at 9:30 pm. The parking lot was dark and empty, and there was only one table about to leave as we entered the store. I guess it didn't help that it was raining that night. Anyhow, I was surprised at how dead this place was as the sign on the door said it closes at 11pm. Just to make sure, we asked what time they closed to plan ahead when to leave accordingly and they told us 10:30 pm. I remember coming here when it was a Chinese restaurant back then and it was pretty lively especially at night.  So the inside of the restaurant, the tables, floors and dishes were honestly kind of dirty. The tea came along with the order sheet to fill out but it came wet covered in the tea the server spilled. I took a look at the prices and they are honestly not all that cheap like what the other reviewers claimed, considering I've tried other places for about the same price and overall experience was much better. We ordered a steam pork and chives dumpling (14pcs) $5.99, fried onion pancake $2.99, beef noodle soup $6.99, and we wanted to try the Korean pork bone soup $7.99. The food came in decent time one after another. The beef noodle soup came in a pretty large bowl (could feed 2) but noodles had a very mild chlorine taste and soup was too merky for my liking, not to mention that there were only 5 small pieces of beef on top. Along came the Korean pork bone soup, and I must say I was pretty disappointed as I had pretty high hopes for this one. The price is the same as authentic Korean restaurants, so it wasn't cheap for something that was so flavourless, and presentation was just awful. Not to mention, we didn't get any Korean side dishes. The soup was not flavourful, the bean sprouts were literally all over the place making the dish super messy and the pork bones were not marinated through as it didn't have a strong spicy taste. Yes, they give you a lot of pieces of meat but it was just a huge mess, very hard to eat, and not authentic whatsoever. The dumplings came after and I hoped it was better but it did not taste good either. The meat had a very weird (rough) texture with a strange flavour. The onion pancake was probably the better of the dishes considering the price and the quantity.  The overall food quality, taste and experience was very disappointing to me. We managed to finish everything super fast as we were the only customers there and took whatever was left with us. And the moment we left the store, the owners closed all the lights and didn't even clean our table - probably left it for clean up tomorrow. Although we weren't like rushed or anything, don't expect any sort of customer service here. I don't suggest coming here for their Korean pork bone soup AT ALL either because it does not taste authentic as the owners are mandarin. Neither should you really come here for dinner because the workers just want to leave and close their store - which I think they should change their business hours. All in all, we have no plans to come back to this place as there are far better dumpling and Korean restaurants in close proximity."}
{"text":"Love this place! I really do believe that this restaurant deserves more than its current rating. Service is average but this restaurant has solid food at fair and affordable prices, with generous portions. I always come for the pork bone soup, kimchi fried rice, dumplings, and red bean paste cake.   Their pork bone soup is possibly the best I've tried despite the fact that it's not entirely a Korean restaurant, they do however offer many Korean dishes in addition to the Chinese menu. But since they specialize in Northern Chinese cuisine, it's not a surprise that there's an overlap in the tastes and similarities between Northern China and Korean cuisine. The pork bones are always tender and the taste is always on point. Portions were more than enough, that I always end up taking home the rest. I pay my visits to Korean restaurants quite often but when it comes to pork bone soup, I will always end up at this place! Kimchi fried rice is delicious as well!"}
{"text":"This place gives me reasons to hate it, but the fact is that the food is cheap, and the food is good, so I will be coming back. I'm writing this review after my second time here. My sister got a teacup that was outright dirty. It was brown and there were chunks of stuff inside. No apology, we had it exchanged. We ordered about 8 items, and one of the orders never came. We asked them twice if everything came, and both times they said yes, but there was an item we specifically ordered that never came. We waited several more minutes, and they brought it out to us. Although the food here is cheap, nobody wants to pay for food they never got. This place has a lot of room for improvement, but the food is good and affordable."}
{"text":"Great value for their dumplings.  Dumplings are tasty and juicy.  I also like the onion pancake beef roll.  Service is below average because no one can speak proper English  (so be prepared to point at menu items or bring a friend who speaks chinese).  Next time I'm going to try the pork bone soup."}
{"text":"I always over order here cuz theres so much option and the foods amazing! Try the dumplings it takes awhiel cuz its hand made. The beef rolls are good too. Bean curd in sesame chili oil yumm"}
{"text":"Went on a monday dinner, restaurant itself is not so fancy but food was good. I almost didn't want to share this place.   Food I had :  dumpling variety, fried dumplings caramelized sweet potatos, cold noodles, stir fried pork, kung pao chicken, fried noodle.  Dumplings : pretty good. I'm not a huge fan of dumplings but they were good.   Cold noodles: had both fresh noodle and buckwheat noodle. Fresh noodle had more chewy texture which I liked it over thin buckwheat noodle.  Both had big pieces of thinly cut pork.   Fried noodle: soso  Kung pao : less batter than regular kung pao you can find at a food court.  Caramelized SP and stir fried pork: Best. I would come back for these. Sweet potatoes get stuck together when it cools down so you might want to take your portion right away. And watch out for the sugar strings. Fried pork, which was flat , thinly battered yet very crunchy was the best dish.   Price : lovely. Cash only but no complaint."}
{"text":"When we arrived at 6:30pm on Fri, it's nearly packed, luckily there's a small table good enough for 3 of us.  After sitting at the table for 10 mins, we don't have tea, plate, chopsticks and even menu.  The reason is there were only 2 ladies doing all the stuff.....Finally we ordered shrimp, pork & veggy dumpling, cumin beef, \"water boiled fish\", steamed bun & sugar coated sweet potato.  First of all the dumpling was really good, very juicy and big.  The fish in \"water boiled fish\" I don't think it's fresh, should be frozen, so I don't recommend this dish.  Steamed bun probably it's from frozen, cause I bought the same buns from a store that sell frozen food b4, but taste good.  Sugar coated sweet potato is good, the sugar coating was not too thick nor too thin, just perfect and the sweet potato itself it's sweet.  Love it.  Cumin beef was the worst dish that we just tried a few pieces and don't even think about packing it up.  Didn't taste like beef at all, the texture is awful.......  To my standard, this restaurant is not clean enough for dine in, so I have to think about it whether go again just for dumpling........"}
{"text":"Amazing dumplings . Thin chewy dough and juicy filling. All made to order that is fresh and hot!! You can get 14 dumplings for cheap as $4.99. I love the hot and sour soup too. not too spicy and not too sour."}
{"text":"Dumpling Restaurant is a fan favorite of locals. In truth neither the food or service is exceptional, but the homeliness of a family-owned small restaurant keeps us loyal folk back for more. Not to mention competitive prices! I always order the same thing: kimchi fried rice and the pork and chive dumplings. Lemme tell you why.  Pork and chive dumplings are solid. You get 14 juicy dumplings of good size. The shell is a little thick and very slightly rubbery. But you won't see me complaining, you do get 14. 14!!!!  The kimchi fried rice is good. Will not blow you away but definitely worth ordering each visit. Real kimchi flavor, shreds of meat and lettuce. Hands down the best rice option on the menu.  If you're accustomed to paying $10.00 for 6 dumplings, be at peace to skip out. But if you're trying to eat well while balling on a budget, EAT HERE."}
{"text":"Inexpensive Chinese dumpling place among many restaurants in the same plaza. This is our second visit; the steamed dumplings are fresh in general. Stir fried dishes are greasy.  Pan fried dumplings were meh; the wrapping is hard.  I guess I will go back to my regular place to fix my dumpling craving."}
{"text":"Tldr: Cash only, great value, delicious dumplings, would recommend  Came here a couple times pre-renovation and post-renovation. This place offers great selection of northern Chinese dishes (with a focus on dumplings ofc), as well as some Korean fusion options. When i came here before the renovation i dreaded the sticky tables and dirty floors, but i endured it because food was worth it. I have to say, after the renovation, this place looks way cleaner and aesthetically pleasing, while maintaining the quality and consistency of their dishes.   When i come here i usually order one type of steamed dumplings (pork and chives is my favourite), one type of fried dumplings, and one noodle item. You can't go wrong with the steamed dumplings here. The wrappers are thin, but strong enough to hold everything together when you pick them up. They put a good amount of delicious filling as well. In terms of the fried dumplings, the pork pot stickers take first place. They're beautifully pan fried, crispy on the outside, juicy and meaty on the inside. For noodles, i personally like the beef noodle soup. Nice beefy broth topped with vegetables (usually shanghai bok choy), and elastic/bouncy handmade noodles.   The place is pretty big, so don't be afraid to bring a larger group. Service is pretty good, though i don't think they speak much English (Mainly mandarin, can understand Cantonese). Price is amazing for the amount of dumplings that you can get, and the noodle portions are good too. Cash only! Would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"IMO, this place is okay. Reasonably clean. Self-serve tea (essentially, coloured hot water) in the back corner of the store.  Service is fairly absent-minded, or standard for Chinese places. They'll take your order and come back for your bill.   The place is good for a craving of shrimp dumplings and noodles at a decent price. The broth in their soups are a bit bland and watery.  The size of their dumplings are pretty \"big\" in comparison to other places in the GTA. The dumplings are well-packed and well-made, but you usually get about 4-5 pieces (it's standardized, but I don't remember how many exactly you get with each bowl/order).   Though the dumplings are good, the rest of the food accompanying the meals are mediocre."}
{"text":"I'm really quite surprised at how highly this place is rated. I've been here 4 times now because my family enjoys how cheap it is but I hate it.   This place is filthy. The floors are sticky and the tables are covered in a layer of grime. Eating here is like playing an hour long game of 'every surface of this restaurant is hot lava'. The photo of the restaurant here on yelp is dated.. Don't let yourself be catfished.  The service is also abysmal. There are usually two waitresses for the entire restaurant and they are quite rude. Tables remain littered with used plates for over 20 minutes after guests have left. I've seen many customers get up to grab themselves utensils and napkins after being ignored by the waitresses over and over again.  If you care at all about the cleanliness and service of a restaurant, I would avoid this place like the plague. You're better off with a rest stop McDonald's on the civic long weekend..."}
{"text":"Dumpling Village really suffering from identity crisis!! Is it a Korean Restaurant, not really. There are mostly Northern Chinese items on the menu like dumplings. Is it a Northern Chinese restaurant, not really There are a lot of Korean dishes  in the menu like pork bone soup, cold wheat bucknoodle soup, kimchi and bean sprout as appetitizers.  The only Korean characters are the 3 on their business sign in the front..and all the rest are in Chinese and English. All the wait staffs here speak Mandarian and even most of the patrons are Chinese.  It is located in a really tiny strip mall.. with limited parkings! To tell you the truth I am in the area for over 10 years I never notice it until I read the reviews on yelp!   We arrived around 6 pm on a Saturday. The restaurant was almost full.  The tables are not really packed together, so you still have a certain degree of privacy at least I cannot tell what the table next to me were eating.  We decided on my favourite chives and pork dumplings, kimchi fried rice and Korean cold bucknoodle soup. They are all $4.99.   The cold noodle soup is so so good! Nice and refreshing! and the soup based is a little sour and it really stimulate your tastebuds and just make you want to eat more! (I can finish it all myself! I don't want to share! I want one all for myself next time!)  The kimchi fried rice.. hmmmmm not good! A little on the oily side. There are not much taste, not spicy enough? We could not finish it and end up have to pack it all to go...(not even sure I will eat it, but cannot just let it all go to waste)  The dumplings arrived last! But it really worth the wait! 14 big fat hot dumplings filled up the whole steamer! Yes I counted them 14 of them for $4.99. They are all freshly made, freshly steamed! The skin is nice and thin, not chewy and thick! Oh so delicious! One bite and all the soup are ozzing out! But if they are not burning hot, you can just stuff the whole thing into your mouth and let the soup and favour just explosed in your mouth.   Just a warning. If you going out on a date, please don't come here. Even it is a good place for a cheap date, our bill was $18 for 2 and we were full! But the place can be noisy, the food too good and your date will be too busy eating and just ignore you! Or you will keep eating and eating and you freak all your friends out!  The services here is cold but efficient. We were given extra napkins without requesting... Maybe we looked really messy??  Cash only!"}
{"text":"CLOSED  Dumpling Restaurant's http://www.yelp.ca/biz/dumpling-restaurant-scarborough 2nd location just opened up in Markham.  This used to be another restaurant that closed down due to competition and lack of businesses... Great to have Dumpling Restaurant moves in as they still keeps their pricing and menu selection as their Scarborough location.  Dumplings.. Dumplings... Dumplings... for $4.99 but for a hot day 35C, I opted for the Korean Buckwheat Cold Noodle ($5.99).  Sizable, Nice and Refreshing.....   Dumpling Restaurant not only bring their good dumplings and noodles up from Scarborough.. but even their slightly sticky floors, tables and chopsticks..maybe that's their trademarks!"}
{"text":"Dumplings are alright for the price. I would come back here for their dumplings and kimchi fried rice.   The men's washroom entrance is at the back, down the stairs. One stall and one urinal. Washrooms are clean from what I've seen so far.   Didn't like the cold noodle because I like my food at least warm. The fried green onion pancake is too filling. Stick to the assorted dumplings and you'll enjoy your meal.  Update: Tried out their beef brisket wrapped in pancake and found it filling and tasty  Service can be slow at times. If you want speedy service, call in for take out! :)"}
{"text":"Very inexpensive and the food is good.   Home made noddles are outstanding, you can definitely taste the difference.    $35 for 5 dishes and you will get two meals out of it."}
{"text":"I love this place! Food comes in very large portions with very affordable pricing. Their dumplings are handmade, and there is a large variety of them. I don't know the exact number, but there should be around 15 dumplings per order. Other dishes they have are equally as good, and despite not being an authentic Korean place, their Korean dishes are tasty too.   The service is not the best, but that may be in part that the waitresses have very limited English skills. Either way, while the service is not outstanding, the servers do their jobs effectively.  Be warned that this place is closed on Tuesdays!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Dumpling village is my absolute favourite place for dumplings in town! Although the service here is almost non-existent, and the place isn't really nice at all. But I can easily forgive all that for the cheap and yummy comfort food you can get here.  The dumplings here are awesome! I'm always excited when my bamboo basket arrives with 14 delicious and juicy dumplings steamed to order. I've gotten all sorts of dumplings here, usually a mixture of pork and some osrt of veggie (fennel, chives, cabbage, mushrooms and zucchini, etc.) My favourite is a more standard one with pork and chives. The dumpling skin is thin, but holds up well, and the filling is absolutely delectable!   Another of my favourite is their pan cake with chives and eggs: crispy, pan-fried pockets stuffed with loads of aromatic garlic chives, bits of scrambled eggs and egg noodles. The piping hot filling is addictively delicious. My family always order a batch of these and pack home the leftovers for a tasty lunch the next day.   The pork pot stickers were comforting and yummy as well. The bottom is pan-fried to a beautiful golden brown and has that wonderful crunch. I particularly enjoy pairing my pot stickers with black vinegar and chili oil.   I also favour their braised beef and pancake wrapped in foil: marinated slices of beef shank and spring onions rolled up with a piece of green onion pancake. The tenderness of the meat was a good complement with the crispy texture of the pancake. However, I personally prefer the beef roll at Asian Legend more, as their version is more refined.   Other items that I've had here include shredded meat and cucumber with vermicelli, dressed with a peanut sauce. It was a light and refreshing dish, and the vermicelli was velvety smooth. \"Silver buns\", which are just simple steamed buns, are soft and well-executed.   For desserts, I've tried their red bean paste cake. The dough is slightly too thick, but there is an abundance of red bean paste to make up for that short fall.  Again, I would say that Asian Legend's version is tastier, but this one is quite satisfying as well.   Dumpling Village never disappoints me, and I'm usually stuffed silly when I walk out of the restaurant. I agree with other Yelpers to just skip the Korean dishes and go straight for the dumplings!"}
{"text":"Fantastic dumplings.   Lots of food for the price.   We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We drive out to this place when we feel like having some LEGIT  dumplings. We always order the beef roll that comes wrapped in tin foil and the round flat bread. My wife, baby and I are stuffed entry time for 30something dollars. Recommended!!"}
