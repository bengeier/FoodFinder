{"text":"We ordered what was best in the menu. The Ribeye and the Harissah Burger .The Ribeye ended up being 60% fat. We left most of it on the table. 50$ wasted on low quality meat.

We asked for the burger to be well done and it was raw.  They apologized by serving us a donuts."}
{"text":"Went there with my wife , the food was delicious , the service was great and the place was very clean! 
You got 5 stars from us"}
{"text":"Visting vegas (again).  J Grill was always my 'go to place' when in Sin City.

About a year ago, they moved just a few doors away to a more spacious place.  

Good move!

NOW, they changed the menu.  Still great shwarmas ... but the upgrades to the menu is great!

The place is still noisy ... but the service is very good and the food is great."}
{"text":"Excellent food. I had the chicken tacos with a side of hummus. The waiter was friendly and attentive. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place was to recommend to me and it lived up to expectations.  It was delicious and the service was fantastic.  Thumbs up for their shawarma and Chanukah jelly donuts."}
{"text":"The new title holder of best kosher Restaurant in Vegas.  Food was great, service was great, atmosphere was great.  Less than 10 mins from the Strip.  Well done!"}
{"text":"We had hummus falafel chicken schnitzel and my son had a burger. Bad service because they had 1 guy waiting tables 3 people standing around doing nothing. Never got any drink refills. Couldn't get the check. Food was not that good. The cooks were either the first Mexican kosher people I have ever met or not kosher. Rice was plain tasteless, served with chopped tomatoes and cucumbers on the side, chicken schnitzel had zero spices in the bread crumbs, hummus had too much Tahiti in it not enough garbanzo beans, falafel undercooked in the middle, hamburger was well done instead of medium. Honestly we wouldnt go back. This is not good Jewish food I have tasted better anywhere. Don't waste your time. Our bill $78.00 overpriced not worth it. Very disappointed.  If there was a zero rating that would be my choice..:-("}
{"text":"Wow my hubby and I have come here at different times throughout the years. I must say the recent changes to the menu (adding tapas and making it more \"bar food\" like with selection and presentation) were really impressive. The tapas are reasonable and delicious. I loved the fish tacos and hubby had the sausage with saut√©ed onions- amazing. Service was great too!"}
{"text":"Oh my!! If you love Mediterranean food this is the place to be.. there were two items that grabbed my attention off the \"tapas\" menu, shawarma tacos and the chimichurri. We couldn't choose so my friend and I took both. They also have a beer and wine menu which I did get red wine with my meal. I took the Moroccan salmon entree which was  a huge serving that I couldn't finish and my friend took the \"Jerusalem grill mix\" entree, so flavorful, the service and the atmosphere was great"}
{"text":"Just had our last meal here and sorry I didn't research better to have ordered for Shabbat. The place is very clean and the food is fresh and tasty. It's been 2 hours and I'm not thirsty.  Good sign that its not overly salted! The hamburger hit the spot -hot off the grill and realized  how much I craved some meat since I last had. The hommous shwarma plate was also very good and the Harissa - both green and red added perfect heat. The grilled tomatoes and onions was a big hit for my husband and I.  We eat Israeli grill very often and Jerusalem Grill in Vegas rates very high. We even took another sandwich for the plane and it s been smelling so good since we left the restaurant. The service was very good and this will be a for sure stop/takeout next time in Vegas. It's pretty close to the strip."}
{"text":"These guys are amazing !!!
Best shawarma outside of Israel great salads and soup. Excellent falafel 
Fast delivery to hotel on the strip even on a busy Sunday night the food came warm and  fast. I would not hesitate  
To order again."}
{"text":"Their food is good. I ordered falafel which came wit two sides, my choice was fries and salad. Their portions are big and the food was well prepared. I would have given them five stars but I think their service need to be improved. I was waiting there for five minutes not sure if I suppose to wait for the host to seat me or just seat myself. Despite the fact that their employs saw me, no one came and greed me. I finally walked to the waiter and asked if I should take a seat or wait to be seated. Other than that if you like Israeli food in Vegas this is probably the best choice"}
{"text":"wonderful staff, great food. burger was HUGE. could only finish half. hub got schwarma plate and he loved it. we walked in 10 minutes to closing and got treated as if we came in 2 hours before closing. perfect! will go back next time were in Vegas"}
{"text":"The pita was very good and the hummus was good. 
Other than that, the food was not good or improperly prepared. The Israeli Salad was not what I am used to. It was only diced cucumber with very little tomato without any olive oil, lemon, salt and pepper to dress it. The lentil soup lacked flavor. The couscous was soggy and bland. The rice was crunchy. The falafel was burned. The French fries were cold. The chicken was OK, but not what we expected. Overall, the food was extremely bland. I make better Israeli salad (which is not difficult to prepare) and hummus at home and will never return. I was extremely disappointed and hoped the food would rival at the food of my home.
Cleanliness was an issue as we observed at the restaurant in addition to the food. There were many filthy things we saw. I had to visit the washroom after using the salt and papper shaker because it was so disgusting I could feel the grime and see yellow and brown left on the handles from patrons before me. After that I was done. Grossed out. And by the way, the washroom was not clean. We were afraid of getting food poisoning or something else because of the cleanliness issues and because some of the food was not up to the proper temperature.
The other problem I had with the place was the service. The service was extremely slow. Our server was very nice, but it took almost 20 minutes just to get drinks. We waited about 40 minutes or so for our food after we ordered. There was also shouting and arguing coming from the kitchen staff which was a little weird..."}
{"text":"I can't really say it's the best place ever , I can say it's decent , the falafel was good and the hummus was made by others 
The service was great and the price was decent."}
{"text":"Review divided into 2 parts, food and delivery/ communication. Food was ordered to go with $20 delivery charge.

Food: absolutely delicious, large portions cooked exactly as asked. Had the Jerusalem grill and a jg burger would recommend both.

Delivery: simply put, terrible. Person on the phone stated it would be 30 minutes for delivery. I called after 45 minutes and was told she would check at which point the call disconnected. This same situation happened 2 or 3 times as if she didn't know how to usr the hold feature of the phone. Food finally arrived over 1.5 hours after order placement.
Redeeming factor was delivery guy called 10 minutes before showing up.

Not sure how the service is in the restaurant, but it can't be worse than the delivery service was."}
{"text":"Classic kosher Schwarma joint with great salads, fresh food, and fast service. Can get loud and mess-hally during peak times. 

I loved my grilled chicken, warm pitas, and salad tasting special for under $30. 

Another kosher option: For a more relaxed place, or if you're with company and would like to sit down and linger, check out Haifa  - about a 10-minute drive."}
{"text":"I have a pet peeve regarding overpriced restaraunts and this is no exception. The place is overpriced even for a kosher restaraunt. The average plate is around $20 and a kids burger is a whopping $12! A kosher steak at a fancy restaraunt is about $30 to $40 and this place is not that, although it is clean and pleasant. However the food is good and the staff is nice, so if you got money to burn or have no choice, its fine. However, I would not recommend shabbat takeout. They charge $44 a person and its a complete ripoff. We expected nice portions of food and got very little in return. Very dissapointing. The food was also very different in taste compared to eating in the restaraunt, not very good and again the portions were tiny. Im giving 3 stars instead of 5 due to the high price and being cheated on the takeout. They should call this place jerusalem greed."}
{"text":"One of the most Israeli experiences I ever had in the states !!!.
From the moment we came inside the door only big smiles and excellent service was surrounding us.
The food was delicious, everything was fresh and the best part of it it's the hummus ! Israeli the way I like it.
Going back to LA with my family happy and full 
Thank you guys ! Excellent Job !"}
{"text":"Too often to get kosher we have to, at a minimum, sacrifice ambiance.  However, in addition to a great burger, Jerusalem Grill has a nice modern vibe.  The staff was friendly and competent.  Again, traits that should be a prerequisite for a service business, but as kosher diners know, is often not the case.  Nice job folks!"}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. Food was mediocre and the atmosphere reminded me of the old kosher restaurants. I live in NY, where the kosher restaurants are nicer and food much better. The owner was obnoxious and rude, they were short staffed. The one good thing, it was nice to be able to have a kosher meal out."}
{"text":"Very very good food!!!
Super nice and quick service 
We came when they was just about to close the kitchen and they still let us in .
I will definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the staff is very sweet and friendly even to customers who love to complain but eat everything on their plates. Good food and fantastic staff."}
{"text":"Great restaurant!

I come to vegas every year and jerusalem grill has stepped ot up.

Best chocken tenders and dips dont miss them next time you come!"}
{"text":"Great price for a delicious meal. Not a beautiful place as its in an ugly outside mall, but I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"10 STARS!!!!

Best Service!!!

The best steak and chimichurri I have ever had!
The cut their own fries nothing frozen, and the they have so many sauces for everything!!
The lamb burger is sick!!!
And the chicken skewers are the perfect marinate!!

Beautiful atmosphere very modern!!!"}
{"text":"I swung by during my stay in Vegas and very glad I did. 

The shawarma in laffa is where it's at. Full of flavor, good portion. 

Tasty Kosher food 2 blocks away from the strip at a decent price = Total score.

{"text":"There's limited kosher food where we live so it's nice to leave town and find a good restaurant.  The food was delicious, the service was good and the prices were alright.  Our server was very friendly and it transformed our \"from out of town\" feeling to feeling more familiar.  We ate there twice during our visit to Vegas and we weren't disappointed either time."}
{"text":"My soul really needed some honey food and this place was the perfect choice. The salads were fresh and delicious. The matza ball soup is out of this world. 
We enjoyed a great dinner and have so much leftovers to take with us home. 
The service was wonderful, the staff is very attentive and knowledge. Thank you for a great experience, we will surly come visit you again and next time we are going to bring all our friends."}
{"text":"When you want to feel a taste of home, this is the place. 
All the Israeli food you can ask for. 
When you eat kosher, like me, there are not too many places to choose from, but even if there where, why bother go else where?"}
{"text":"great service from our waitress, good ambience and the food is AMAZING!! definitely recommend"}
{"text":"3.5*, really, but 3* just felt low.

SE corner of Decatur and Trop

Had a nice falafel pita that took less than 5 minutes for them to make (ordered in store for takeout). The whole experience feels very Israeli, from the Hebrew being spoken in the store to the attitude (which was a combo of direct to the point of being abrupt, immensely friendly, and charming to the point that you feel like they're somehow getting over on you -- which if you've ever been to Israel, you know what I mean).

The schug (Note 1: this is spicy chili paste, otherwise known as harif or harissa. Note 2: remember that the 'ch' is as in challah, so this is 'sss-ch-oog', not 'shoog' as it would be in German) is intense, so I'd recommend on the side (and I like spicy food).

The veggies, pickled and otherwise, in the pita were solid, and if you want hummus in your pita, you should ask for tahini on the side, as the dab of hummus you get in the pita is quite small.

Overall super tasty though, and i'll update after trying the shawarma."}
{"text":"This restaurant is fantastic! The service and the vibe is great! But most importantly the food was amazing! Best shawarma in town! It's the Closest thing you have, that tastes like food in Israel! Defiantly recommend this restaurant! 5 stars all day son!"}
{"text":"Went there a couple of days ago. The place was busy but not too much. The nice hostess welcome
Me and my girlfriend with a smile right when we walked in and told us she will have us seated right away. After 30 seconds we sat down and got 2 starters whice were reallly good! A minute after a lovely waiter named Eddie came and introduced him to us and told us about the place . Eddie was really professional and kind and pointed me to what he  thought i would like the most! I ordered the rib eye steak and my lady took the pargiot which is actually a baby chicken 2 skewer dish. For starter we ordered a humus mushroom and stuffed grape leaves. Eddie was really quick and fun and got our drinks and starters right away. The humus was sooo good it reminded me of israel and the grape leaves were delicious! And then came the main course! My rib eye steak was amazing! I asked for a medium and got exactly what i asked for! The meat was so
Tasty! I have had alot of steaks all over the world and that one was one of the best i had! My girlfriend dish was amazing as well. The dishes came with 2 side dishes each. The mashpotatos were awesome and the israeli salad was just like it is in israel! Our lovely waiter kept getting us everything we needed before we even asked for it, napkins, toothpicks and made sure everything is great! Our experience was amazing the service was amazing and the food was defiantly 5 starts! Way to
Go jerusalem grill you will defiantly see me again!"}

{"text":"Don't let the decor scare you away, the food is awesome! I ate here 2 nights in a row, had schwarma the first time and schnitzel the 2nd time. Both were really excellent and very fresh. The salads taste homemade. And the best part is that service is super fast and very courteous, we got our food within minutes, (which was great cause we were starved)"}
{"text":"Great food! The chimichurri hanger steak starter was just perfect. The rest was great as well. I only gave 4 stars because our waiter wasn't MIA, but all the other waiters were helpful in getting us what we needed. I would return because the food was so good."}
{"text":"The best restaurant ever!
One of the great Mediterranean restaurant in the USA!
If you didn't eat here you never had good food in your life...
And the best of the west service!!!!"}
{"text":"your favorite Israeli food can be found here ... always fresh , cannot go wrong . we always coming back while in Vegas"}
{"text":"This is the premier kosher restaurant in Las Vegas. In particular, I really enjoyed feasting on the beef baklava and hanger steak, amazing appetizers. My entree was a 16 oz black angus rib eye, cooked to perfection. Can't wait to come back when I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Kind of an unusual mix to the menu ... Mediterranean, Jewish, Mexican, and Chinese? Strange. But everything I have tried has been good. The shawarma, hummus, Turkish coffee, kabob, and fajitas have all hit the spot at one time or another."}
{"text":"Wow! What an improvement! Talk about service change and the atmosphere! The food here is always the best in town! I spoke to the owner today and he explained to me about the management at the current time and now it's all fixed! 

BOTTOM LINE 5 STARS! BEST SHAWARMA IN LAS VEGAS AND THE BEST SERVICE I HAVE EVER RECEIVED!"}
{"text":"Good eats, good service.   This is not the Las Vegas version of Prime Grille, so you wouldn't take your clients here to impress them.

I'm an observant Jew so I'm just glad to eat where the food is good and the location is  near where I want to be.   This place is close to the strip and Chabbad.
The shwarma was more than I could eat and the London whatever was delicious (and fast).

Vegas can't compete with NYC or LA but if the question is \"hungry?\"  than this place is a good answer."}
{"text":"Breakfast was fantastic this morning. My French toast was cooked perfect n my husband's steak breakfast was cooked right. Thanks again Lou's n of course the great service."}
{"text":"Mmm mmmmm this was a great choice. I stumbled across this hidden gem after wanting to try something new. As soon as we walked in there was excellent customer service. We told our waitress it's our first time so she went above & beyond to accommodate us. The vibe in the restaurant is very nice & family oriented. I will defiantly come again."}
{"text":"It's hard to find tucked into a dismal strip mall. When you enter it's surprising bright and open, and much larger than expected. The shawrma is only OK, but I don't need a kosher option so I'm not that impressed."}
{"text":"Best shawarma and humnus in las vegas! Quality service and probably the cleanest and freshest kosher restaurant in vegas! Our server eddie was amazing! This restuarant is so authentic I feel like im eating in Jerusalem again!"}
{"text":"Reheated kabob....Complained to the server and was nothing but rude and argued with me. The people next me also seemed pretty upset with their food as well. 

When we asked for the bill, the owner came by, tried to address the issue with my food and was being very nice. However, I explained to him how it was already ate the food and at this point there was nothing to be done. Did offer to take it off the bill but that wasn't my point, nor what I wanted. If I am paying $28.99 for an entree, I expect fresh food at a decent portion size. 

However, the rest of the group that just ordered Shawrma were happy with their food, besides it being very spicy."}
{"text":"Meal was good, not phenomenal.  Schwarma and lamb were very good, steak was OK.  Service was fast and efficient, but a little discombobulated.  Getting seated was an experience, they tried to send us to their uncrowded dairy restaurant in the same mall.  

They do not have a liquor licence, but if you want wine, there is a liquor store in the same mall that carries kosher wines.  And they will cork for you for free at the restaurant.  

I would have rated them 4 stars, but they lose 2 stars since one of their employees stole my credit card.  After eating there,  I returned to my hotel and discovered $4000 in Skype charges were on made on my Amex at 11:30 that evening - probably after the crook got off work.  I hadn't used the card in a few days, so there was no doubt where the sticky fingers were.  I hope they fire/catch the jerk!  Maybe if I go back there, I'll just bring cash."}
{"text":"One thing I learn about Kosher food is that it is exceedingly pricey. And it makes me wonder why is kosher meat way more expensive than non-kosher meat. While dining in, I had an opportunity to speak to the manager Aviva and learn a great deal about how to distinguish Kosher meat while also gaining some knowledge about Parve food. 

The reason why kosher meat is more expensive is that in Jewish Law, they follow specific criteria how an animal is slaughtered. In order for the meat to be kosher, the animal must be healthy, must not have any disease, punctured wounds, or broken bones. This information in itself gave me assurance that the meat I'm consuming is from a healthy animal. 

Next I ask what is it that makes Parve food so different. In Jewish Law, they cannot cook or consume meat together with dairy. However with Parve food, since it has no dairy and no meat, it can be eaten with either meat or dairy. It is a little confusing to understand, but I can see why it is important to consume good quality and clean food.

I begin my order with a Limonana Slushie ($5) which is a house blended lemonade with fresh mint leaves, and this drink taste light and it's so refreshing. I went for the Matzaball Soup ($9) which is a Jewish soup dumpling made from a mixture of matzah meal, eggs, water, and oil. The soup is serve hot and it comes with two homemade Matzaballs that are slow cooked in a savory chicken broth, and it has soft vegetables like carrots, onions, red bell pepper, zucchini, celery, and pumpkin. I like the soup and I can taste the flavor, I just wish I had more than two Matzaballs. 

For entr√©e, I chose the Hummus & Shawarma ($15) which is serve with thin strips of slow roasted chicken, Jerusalem hummus, and two freshly baked pita bread. The pita bread is thick and it's sourced from a vendor that makes real pita bread like in Jerusalem. The strips of chicken are tender and well-seasoned. The Jerusalem hummus has a pronounce taste of tahini flavor and it's garnish with cooked chickpeas, onions, bell pepper, paprika, and parsley. I like the hummus, it is very filling especially when it's eaten with pita bread. I wanted to save room for dessert so I had the rest of my meal packed to-go. 

Now there isn't a dessert list on the menu, it's something you would have to ask and inquire what they have available. I chose Parve Triple Chocolate Fudge Cake ($12) and given how there is no dairy, the cake does taste very light but I wish they had put more chocolate flavor to give this dessert a little more oomph. The interior restaurant looks modern and high end, there is good music in the background, they have TV for entertainment, and the service is exceptionally friendly. One important tip is if you are a local resident, you get a local discount on your meal."}
{"text":"I took a group to Jerusalem Grill and I was so happy of my choice. Close to 30 people were given speedy service, delicious food, and were served so quickly I could hardly believe it.

The staff was totally attentive to peoples' needs. We had two vegans with us and they filled them up with chumus, salads, rice and beans, 

Definitely the best restaurant in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculously good. Homemade hummus with mushrooms and onions. Lamb, beef and chicken combo juicy and tasty. Fresh hot pita. And he service was amazing. All for a really reasonable price. It is a gem in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Found this place in a strip mall. Felt like middle eastern food. We ordered a flaffel and a shawarma in pita. Both were great. Shawarma was all lamb. Huge portion of meat in the pita. They also set out spicy olives carrots and radishes. Flaffel was moist with lots of flavor. Good deal for the price. Had a late night snack with leftovers back at the hotel"}
{"text":"Everything on the menu except for the sandwiches is overpriced. And the service needs a serious upgrade. For years, the consistency has been the careless staff and quite frankly, the food isn't good enough for me to put up with it more than a few times a year.

Try to call in your take out order, but good luck getting them to pick up the phone.
When you enter, if there's anyone else waiting, beware that you'll probably get ignored by all four employees who will inexplicably assume you are with the other customer- even though you guys walked in separately, minutes apart, and look nothing alike.

Eventually you'll ask someone if you can place an order for takeout, and they'll act irritated that they have to give you a menu. They'll also give you the dinner-only menu that doesn't include the sandwiches, you'll have to ask again for it.

When you finally get to this point, your pita sandwich can be made with falafel, shwarma, koobideh, or a couple other things. The first two are your best bet. Be aware that upgrading your wrapping to laffa will be an extra $2.50. 
$10 and a side of fries is decent for the wrap, which is packed with tahini, cabbage, Israeli salad, and the world's tiniest dab of hummus, but it's hella filling and can easily be your main meal of the day even without the fries.

If you dine in, the all-you-can-eat salad for $3, added on to your meal, is a great deal...but be sure you will actually have room for it. And as others have said, the entire table needs to order it for you to be able to partake- if you're with more than one other person, it likely isn't worth it."}
{"text":"A Glatt Kosher (Chabad) restaurant is such a find in Vegas, especially when the food is great, the service is exceptional, and they know what a bencher is.  It's a bit pricey, but well worth the cost for the quality, taste, and amount of food you get."}
{"text":"Was nice to have good kosher mediterranean food.  The service was excellent and the food was good.  More Moroccan Kosher but none the less prepared well great ingredients and fresh.  They offer special orders and Shabbat meals if you order ahead.
 Tried something different with the Moroccan cigars for an appetizer, very good as well.  A good variety and nice casual atmosphere. 
  The gyros looked good and smelled good as we all ordered dinner meals. Food was well prepared and the bread was served warm and soft.  I have nothing bad to say except after a great meal the dessert choices were limited to Baklava, was in the mood for chocolate cake.  Casual atmosphere some dinner choices will cost more.  I would recommend for lunch definitely and we did....dinner also good."}
{"text":"Hilarious that this place sells arabic food and wants to pass it as israeli...the food was ok but not authentic arabic food , it lacked the proper spices.The service was not very good , had to repeatedly ask for service."}
{"text":"Soooo happy we found this place. Finally a restaurant that gets it. And it's Hanukkah! The matzo ball soup is homemade, falafel and hummus is amazing. Definitely coming back. Thank you!"}
{"text":"last sunday we were going to give it a try and the smell of a dirty rug had us turn at the door !!!"}
{"text":"Please reconsider if your planning to eat there.  Food sucks, bland and expensive fr the quality.  They have moroccan food in their menu but as a moroccan myself, i promise it has nothing to do with moroccan food.  What a joke.  AVOID!"}
{"text":"The waitress was very nice.  I loved the white bean soup and I really recommended it.  Very easy access to parking and the food is fairly priced. 

I did not like the mashed potatoes or French fries at all they were the type you buy frozen at Ralph's and put in the microwave.  Everything else was AMAZING. And I was with a group of 11 ppl so we all shared almost everything on the menu."}
{"text":"I had a great time eating here. Great food, great service. It's a simple yet cozy atmosphere. I have friends that love this kind of food. I can't wait to have them try it out as well. Thank you for the great experience."}
{"text":"They are closed at 5:14pm on a Wednesday with no notice or explanation on yelp, website or their door. Wasted a trip as no answer to place order and no recording mentioning they are closed. Went to Fat Greek instead and now that I found them I will be a customer of them from now on. Fat Greek is just across the street on Decatur and Flamingo also."}
{"text":"I'd been here, once a year or so ago, with friends and recalled a good time overall.  It was because of that experience that I told some Jewish friends about it, as they're long time Vegas locals who had not yet been.

The food was palatable, but as others have noted, it was quite bland. I ordered the schnitzel with couscous and Israeli salad.  For a $22 entree, the couscous was bland, with diced vegetables on top, the salad was pretty dry, but the schnitzel itself was good.  Others in our party also remarked that soups and falafels that they had were good, but bland.

Our biggest issue with our dining experience was our server. He visited our table 3 times in short succession while we were still deciding on our choices, but then had to be flagged down whenever we needed something. Drinks? Ask for straws. Appetizers delivered?  Ask for plates. Then, he was scarce for the rest of our meal, often seen busily chatting with other staff off in a corner.

For dessert, I ordered a Turkish coffee and tiramisu. $7 for a tiny serving of mostly whipped topping.

I could see prices like this, if they were on The Strip, but, as a local myself, it's too steep."}
{"text":"Amazing kosher food!! Highly recommend..
Came to this restaurant because my sister eats only kosher and I'm glad we  did! The food was great and the service as well.
We ordered a burger and chicken , everything was well made.. and we cold not  finish so we had to Pack most of the stuff-definitely worth the price !
 we will be back on our next trip to Vegas for sure"}
{"text":"The food for me was ok but my friends who came with me the had some issues with the food the portion inside was almost less then normal the came and exchange it to another one it was almost the same not much difference The person who was cooking oh preparing the food to us look at us extremely angry just because there was not enough food inside of the sandwich  
Plus no big deal here but I was supposed to get free fountain drink using yelp but I never got one"}
{"text":"I had Shawarma, Dad had Falafel. Pita was the best we've had outside Israel. Falafel was best we've had in the US. Shawarma was perfectly cooked, pita was thick and soft. Easily the best Mediterranean meal we've had in the US. I do recommend you try this place."}
{"text":"When I visited Las Vegas, we were really looking for a nice place to eat. 
I can tell you it's more than a nice place, it's clean, professional, the food is amazing.
Highly recommended!
You won't be sorry
Love it!"}
{"text":"I gotta say It brought back a lot if memories of the Middle East. The food and service were great. Even the older gentleman who owns the place was nice. He had this grouchy look but it added to the atmosphere, made it much more authentic. Even if I didn't like anything I would have been to scared to tell him. Lol. The salad bar was the best. They bring you little sides of salads and appetizers. Leave some space for the rest of the goodies. Will be back very soon"}
{"text":"It's the worst service I ordered a plate of chicken $24.03 burn pieces of chicken I can't believe that this is real"}
{"text":"Um no. I wouldn't recommend. It's very outdated and the food is lacking in so many ways.. The beer was good I think. They need to step it up a few notches.. Eek"}

I try the falafel it was great . No wait for the food is the best part. 
Thank you guys ! It was cool"}
{"text":"Freaking amazing

The hosts are really amazing people.

As I like to eat many different foods I asked for the. To give me a little bit of everything and I must say. Falafels were the bomb so we're the pargiyot and the Schwarma. 

I will definitely be back"}

Everything we tried was wonderful -- a group of five of us shared the Mediterranean assortment platter, grape leaves, hummus and falafel, and Jerusalem grill mix. We also shared the (giant) caramel cheesecake. We would all highly recommend making this a stop and will be back anytime we are in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Be really careful if you're ordering for Shabbat. I don't mind spending $30 for a turkey sandwich if it's good, or $12 for a thin sliver of tiramisu; but when I asked if the turkey was fresh and was assured it was, only to find it was a couple of slabs of pretty gross turkey salami roll on a hamburger bun, that was a bit over the top.  Basically threw $120 in the garbage and dampened an otherwise wonderful Shabbat.

I've heard the in-restaurant experience is better, but was too shell shocked to go back and find out"}
{"text":"My best steakhouse in Las Vegas. Food is amazing. Service is too fast. Will come back."}
{"text":"Came here expecting cheap kosher Israeli food but the food was exceptional and the service was really fast. The ambience was nice too."}
{"text":"I'm originally from Israel, but lives in the USA for awhile, travel a lot and always in a look for good Israeli food. Went here last week and had a great time! 
The server Aviva was extremely nice, friendly, speaking Hebrew and English, and made sure we were happy! 
Service was fast! The food was absolutely delicious and very authentic , the place was clean, quite and nice.. 
will definitely be back next month when I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Wow the shawarma tacos here are insane!
The staff here is phenomenally attentive and you just feel like you are at elegant restaurant but at the same time at home!
The food here is not only the freshest kosher restaurant literally 5 minutes away from the strip and the best service I have received from all the kosher places in town!"}
{"text":"The food at Jerusalem is good, authentic Israeli style falafel, shawarma, and other dishes.  The servers were also great, and very friendly.  The only problem was that my wife's order was messed up, but fixed very quickly.  I also noticed that one person at the table next to us had her order messed up as well.  
I'll stop by when I'm in Vegas next."}
{"text":"If you are in Vegas and you miss home then this is the place to go.
Home style well done Israeli cousin  with all what you can imagine ,just say it and they will have it .
Speak your language and eat your food ,what else when you are far from home 
Lior is a great guy and he will cater for your need 100%

{"text":"If you are looking for a delicious middle eastern food..than you are at the right place!
I tried few dishes every time I eat there and they were always very tasty and fresh. Very friendly and clean. I am definatly recommending this restsursnt..weather you eat only kosher food or just want a tast of Israeli food!"}
{"text":"I was extremely surprised by the wonderful experience at the Jerusalem Grill.  The food was delicious, the service was very good, even though it was packed.  The smiling attitude of the staff was a revelation.
I was there with two non-Jewish business associated, who enjoyed the place thoroughly.  We tried three different starters and three different entrees, which we all shared to enjoy the variety.  It was terrific.  The helpings were enormous.
The prices were very reasonable for a kosher establishment. I will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!
Great food, with a large menu of options, and wonderful service. So happy they are in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Best food ever!!!! If you are looking for clean, unique and best service-this is the place! You food is amazing we went for dinner everything was fast, the food was delicious! We will come back soon!"}
{"text":"Been to the place a few more times after i wrote the review and the staff did acknowledge my review and have seen a great improvement in service. Nice to see a restaurant taking feedback and ensuring their customers have a great experience. Will be hitting this place a lot more times now."}
{"text":"I was completely new to middle eastern cuisine. Our serve was amazing at helping me and my friends order. Excellent service. Chicken shawarma, basmati rice, falafel with hummus and beef cigars were all amazing. I would definitely recommend and go back."}
{"text":"This restaurant is absolutely overpriced. I don't mind paying for quality food, although when the portions are not enough for a starving child, it is a problem. I came to the restaurant on a Sunday evening with my girlfriend and grandfather about 8 p.m. We were not greeted upon entry and not asked what we would like to drink once we were seated. Fifteen minutes after, we were asked what we would like to eat. We had to remind the waitress to bring our beverages. Upon ordering the waitress did not write down our requests which I found to be completely unprofessional. The food was mediocre at best. Every entree was at least $22 and the portions were not an adequate amount. My grandfather ordered the beef cigars, I would relate them to 7-11's taquitos. We all would have been better off with those to eat. They brought two sauces out which both were not of my taste. I have ate at many Mediterranean restaurants in the area and I would say this is two stars. Mazel Tov."}
{"text":"We were surprised by surprisingly nice ambiance in an unassuming strip mall.
The waitstaff was friendly and not pushy. Aviva was excellent. The food was fresh and tasty.
I would come back to eat here again (and skip breakfast)."}
{"text":"I was very happy with few items and very unhappy with few others. Chicken entr√©e was $22 - I have no idea how they came up with such price for so simple and non gratifying item. Falafel was good and bread were very good."}
{"text":"Highly recommended for real vegetarians and vegans!
I called in at 8:30 for a 9pm reservation and the table was prepared for us with small dips and fresh pita bread and water! The have a variety of different Mediterranean tapas & small salad appetizers! I truly believe I haven't tasted a better hummus since Israel in 2001. I would recommend this Kosher Restaurant to anyone that would step foot in Las Vegas! 
Thank you for the 5-Star Service!"}
{"text":"Food was great. The staff was very friendly. However, the service could be better. This is the best kosher place in Vegas though..."}
{"text":"Palestinian food i love it 
Falafel and hummus 
Its amazing 
It took me back to old days with the arabic Palestinian taste 
Thank you"}
{"text":"I met Chef Leo at a catered event, and he was so friendly and helpful and the food so amazing that I already have plans to visit Jerusalem Grill Las Vegas with family joining us this weekend to share the amazing experience with them. Needless to say, I highly recommend trying this place!"}
{"text":"Little piece of Israel in Las Vegas.. nice ambience and great food"}
{"text":"The best shawarma in town
Open late and  always hit the spot 

Great service
The best pita and Hummos

Make sure to ask for baklava )
It's a killer"}
{"text":"Fantastic place for great tasting food. The hummus was rich and flavorful and the falafel balls were crisp outside and moist inside with excellent flavor as well. Freshly made pita bread thick and warm from the oven. Try a little of the hot spicy red chili sauce on a falafel for a real taste sensation.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I have a multitude of friends in the Las Vegas and Summerlin area who are Jewish and because they keep kosher I've had the pleasure of visiting the majority of the kosher establishments of Las Vegas.

This by far is one of my favorites. There is always a sense of consistency here with the service and the food. The stag is always friendly and the food is always delicious. 

I had some friends visiting from out of town this last weekend for the ASD show and we decided to come on in for a bite.

Needless to say it was extremely busy as most of the kosher restaurants were. But as usual the service was courteous and as speedy as they could be.

This time around we went with some of the smaller plates and tapas and then moved on to sharing a few of the entrees.

We went with the shawarma tacos and the sliders. I give them both a solid 4/5. They mix very traditional Mediterranean flavors with new and eclectic tastes to give a spin on something old. Have to love the innovation of the place. 

We decided to go ahead and get a couple of the mix grill platters which is a must have when you come here. A variation of their best selling skewers both beef and chicken. We definitely give them a 5/5.

Overall another magnificent experience. And everyone agreed this is the best kosher spot in Vegas for friendly service, a clean environment and a delicacy of flavor."}
{"text":"Great food!! Anything I tried was delicious! The place is big and the service good ! I'm highly recommend for how want to eat good and a lot!!Don't miss this place ! We went there every day and tried different things to eat. Of course is kosher!


If you in Vegas and you want to eat a good meal you better go there you will love it !!

The stuff is nice and work fast ."}
{"text":"We live in Portland, Oregon (where there are no kosher restaurants outside of our MJCC, so we have to drive to Seattle to eat out). Every time we visit Las Vegas to see our close friends, one of the first things we try to do is visit Jerusalem Grill. We have visited in the old location (phenomenal food), and liked it a lot - the new location is remodeled superbly, feels very modern and family-friendly, the staff is very friendly, and there is a terrific atmosphere. And the food tastes even better than we remembered. By far our favorite kosher restaurant out of all those we have tried in the US. Well-done!"}
{"text":"We've found them on yelp. They're friendly ,and have very good quality food. Chicken Shawarma, Beef kabob, and Chicken Breast. 
Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The meats were fantastic.  Best I've had.   The host is also a stud.   He had me say that."}
{"text":"The first time we came we received bad service and left a bad review on yelp. However, the owner treated us with great value and respect and invited us back to have a free meal. Remy took great care of us. Amazing service and amazing food. Thank you for valuing your customers!"}
{"text":"Just placed an order of fried chicken aka schnitzel. Paid a ridiculous price of 53 dollars. Delivery Israeli guy with heavy accent telling me at my door step that \"just so you know this is not including my tip since the restaurant take all the $20 delivery charge and gives us nothing \" !! Yes ! I paid $33 dollars for a piece of fried chicken and $20 delivery. Shame shame shame ! Thieves with license! You should be behind bars for scamming the American people! Shame on you \"Jerusalem thieves\" not \"Jerusalem grill\" !
And by the way I shut the door on the rude greedy Israeli."}
{"text":"They switched locations to their dairy spot, same shopping setting, but now the place is beautifully built. 
Food was still amazing as always, I got the chicken plate with cous could and salad, and a side of hummus with falafel."}
{"text":"Love coming here every time im in vegas. Amazing service and the best food. Im never disappointed"}
{"text":"This place is decent for kosher food.  I was in vegas to introduce my fiance to my father, stepmother and brother.  We needed a kosher restaurant that was near the strip, but not on it, and one that would be ok for people who do not always eat kosher.  The food was decent, the portions were huge.  The service was pretty slow, even though we were one of two tables in there when the meal started.  The place could be cleaner, but overall it was ok."}
{"text":"Oy vey! Where to start? We come in and ask if they have a kids menu.. They offer hot dogs and chicken nuggets we order the hot dogs for our kids... Waiter comes out 5 min later sorry no hot dogs.. K fine he walks away and refuses to take our order cuz apparently we're taking to long?? We order chicken nuggets from.a different waiter and they bring them out frozen dinosaur chicken nuggets from the box for $12 for frozen chicken nuggets.  Perfect I could have defrosted these in my hotel room.. We ask for rice... 6$ for a bowl of b rice... Shwarma was like a quarter of the size of any other place.. Who charges $20 for a piece of schnitzel? Overall disappointed won't be coming back!"}
{"text":"So going to Vegas is always fun, but the kosher restaurants there so far were Blah except for this place.  I went Monday Night and it was busyyyyyyyyy.  The service was amazing even for a Kosher place, who knew a Kosher place could have a friendly staff and they would be nice.  This place is and even better is the food.  The beef Kababs Yum so moist, so tender and sooooooo Tasty.  I really liked it.  I also enjoyed the Shawarma plate, baby chicken again really tasty and not fatty at all.  

So when in Vegas and you keep kosher this is the place to go.  They also have Rib Eye and Lamb but did not try that yet.  I will be back.  

They have been opened less then a year."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a good place if you want to taste Middle Eastern Food. The restaurant is cozy looking, the bright yellow signs are easy to spot and the outside of the restaurant is clearly marked. The kitchen looks clean and inviting. 
I went there with a friend of mine. We were very hungry and we ordered falafel, hummus, babaganoush and pita bread. The hummus was nice, the babaganoush was delicious, but the falafel was not tasty ((( It was flavorless and without character. I didn't like it at all...
Overall, the food looked pretty good, the service was friendly and quick, the ambience was fine, but some of the dishes needed some work to make them tasty and memorable."}
{"text":"I've searched the website for a kosher meet restaurant, I had 2 result one of them says that he is 10 min from the strip u asked the taxi driver and he told me its 25 min driving!! I went to Jerusalem grill and I just loved it! The service was great! The food was really good ill defiantly go back there!!"}
{"text":"Hands Down the BEST in Las Vegas! This place is amazing! I have had the pleasure of eating here a few times! Each and every experience has been absolutely great! The service is always spot on and the people who work here are so nice! The owner Lior is the BEST! So welcoming and accommodating! That really makes such a huge difference in a person's dining experience. I have plenty of friends from Israel so I started eating Kosher style foods years ago! It's hard to find consistency in some restaurants but this one has mastered that! If you find yourself in Las Vegas craving Kosher food, do yourself a favor and get into Jerusalem Grill & Bar! Some of my personal favorites here are the....

Mediterranean Assortment Platter-Purple Coleslaw, Roasted Babagnush, Garbanzo-Cilantro Salad, Moroccan Salsa, Garlic-Carrot Salad, Corn & Dill Salad, Egg-Salad and Fried Eggplant w/ Bell Peppers. (Well worth the $24) especially if you are sharing with a table!

Hummus & Falafel- Comes with 6 falafel balls w/ hummus

Chicken Shawarma- Slow cooked chicken w/ house blended spices.

Moroccan Salmon- Fresh marinated salmon baked w/ caramelized tomatoes, Garbanzo Beans, Bell Peppers, Garlic, Onions, and Cilantro.

As long as they keep up this fantastic work I will be returning again and again!!!!!! :-)"}
{"text":"Great Kosher food and service but many Orto.
This place is highly recommended.
Manager was very friendly and compassionate about the Orto"}
{"text":"Very good food but expensive. We were there on a Friday for lunch and it didn't seem like they have a lunch menu, or perhaps not on a Friday. We got 2 chicken skewers with 2 sides for $24, Matzah ball soup for $10.50 for one person. I understand that it is costly to operate a kosher restaurant, but a can of soda for $3 seems excessive. Also, if you are selling matzah ball soup, it doesn't seem right to charge extra for the matzoh balls."}
{"text":"The 2nd time I get to Las Vegas and stop to eat there. 
The salads smell like 3 weeks old. 
From 8 salads 4 was bad!!! Bad!!!
We eat mix Gril homos with mushrooms 1 beer 1 coke and I paid 66$.
It's seems like the owner don't care about how the customers will feel later. 
I don't want to be mean but Restorant should be carful when they serve bad food. 
Bad bad food. Not fresh. 
 

 

Update 7/ 26
After one day since I reviewed the owner contact me and Ofer to meet and talk and to Refund me. 
I don't want the money, it's not about the money. 
I just wanted to rich over to the owner and ask him that he will be responsible for the food he sales. 
I hope Jerusalem resturant will be better. 
I'm happy to find out a young man that want to take pride with his business and grow it. 
He apologize and offered me a full refund and free dinner. 
I want to believe it was one time thing, and I will come to visit again next time I'm in vegas to see if it's changed. 


All the best

{"text":"In Vegas for a veterinary conference and my husband found this place while searching vegetarian options on Yelp. It was extremely crowded when we walked up, but the hostess got us seated very quickly at the bar and gave me a compliment on my baby bump. Our server was so kind and acted like he wasn't also serving a ton of other people. The food came quickly, which we watched being prepared behind the counter-very clean setup! We got: 

Hummus
Falafel plate w/couscous an Israeli salad
Matzo ball soup (vegetarian!)
 
The hummus was creamy and perfect. We were eating it by the spoonful. The matzo ball soup was great for a chilly night and wasn't bland like most veggie matzo. The falafel was THE BEST I'VE EVER HAD. Small and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. 
Overall fantastic experience and they even gave us a complimentary dessert!"}
{"text":"The 2nd time was a better experience, the host took good care of us and made a difference, thank you."}
{"text":"Great midwestern / Israeli food , there are better options here in Vegas but this one is one of my favorites."}
{"text":"For authentic and high quality Israeli food you can not beat this place. Their hummus is very high quality and fresh. As a vegetarian I also enjoyed their bread, falafel, and baba ganoush. 

The manager Lior is really cool, try to talk to him if you can. He really knows his stuff and can help match your taste with his food.

Nice decor as well."}
{"text":"We had the most horrible experience we ever had,
We went to have lunch yesterday and the minute we walked in one of the waitres jumped on us because we had our service dog with us and she was screaming for us to get out, my wife told her that it's a service dog ,she didn't care.
We take our dog with us every where we go, never had a problem, and it's not like we took a PIG with us to a kosher restaurant, 
Thank you for horrible experience ."}
{"text":"Stay away.
Food is bad and overpriced, and the service is even worse. I know exactly how Israeli food should be. The Pita is tasteless and the quality of the meat is bad (both Shawarmma and grilled chicken). The lamb \"kababs\" are dry and hard. Salad tastes weird. 
On top they charge almost 20% \"automatic gratuity ."}
{"text":"Wow, that's was delicious, this is a kosher restaurant, on the main road. Have eaten there twice in tree days staying in Vegas. The team restaurant was gentle and make our meal great, I have eat the angus steak and hamburger, most the tasty I have ever ate before, 5 from 5!"}
{"text":"I went to Vegas this past week for a business trip, and few of my colleagues and I decided to eat at the Jerusalem Bar and Grill this 
past Wednesday the 21st. The food was phenomenal, however, the service was could have been better. I understand there are plenty of other tables to assist but I also feel it's important to make ALL guests feel welcomed. My server Anatoly did not deliver the full fascinating experience we could have had, other than that I would definitely recommend going there, the food was GREAT!"}
{"text":"wow this is my second time going there and I'm so pleased with the quality of their food ! fresh veggies, warm pita and awesome hummus, juicy shawarma! will go back there again and again and again!"}
{"text":"Blown away by their service!!. Just got to my hotel room and opened the food ,everything is delicious!! 

We were on the way back from a long road trip with not much kosher food. My wife called in to order and mentioned how hungry i was. When i got their they wasted no time in getting me my order. The guy behind the counter was awesome. He threw in some salads and pitas knowing how hungry i was. 

If your in Vegas and need some kosher food, this is the spot. They also moved since my last time being here to a much nicer place next door."}
{"text":"100 Stars!

I did not expect there to be a Mediterranean/Glatt kosher restaurant in Las Vegas. I found this restaurant on yelp and decided to go here after reading good reviews on yelp.

I ordered the Jerusalem grill mix which comes with Chicken kabob, chicken shawarma, and beef kabob, i also got it with couscous and a side of steak fries. Tasted EXCELLENT!

My wife and friends ordered shawarma plates and they were equally good. 

Service was friendly and prompt.

It's good to know that there is a great kosher restaurant in Vegas and we will definitely be back here next time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"I was here a couple of years ago, and they totally changed the restaurant. It used to feel very homey and casual. It was bright, paper table cloths and napkins. Now it's a little cold and lifeless. Now it's dark, with cloth napkins. I don't like it as much. The prices are the same...expensive. $50 for two people (before tip), and I was still hungry when I left. The food is pretty much the same, but they have tapas which I don't think they had last time I was there. But the authentic flavor is there. I just don't like the new look. Sorry."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Had the falafel which is some of the best.  Friend had a burger which he loved. Can't find anything to complain about."}
{"text":"Kemo Babayt. Warm Israeli atmosphere friendly service and tasty food.

Large menu. Good choices. Near to the strip."}
{"text":"Wow this place is amazing!! Clean place, great food and excellent service.  The price is not bad at all. Just the best place you can find"}
{"text":"Was here for dinner and also ordered meals to be delivered to my hotel. The food was cooked well. The shawarma sandwich was a nice meal. The kebab portion was on the smaller portion size. The prices are not too high. The place is plain and clean. Service was quick and efficient"}
{"text":"Jerusalem Grill used to have great food before the remodel. I used to go there a lot while in Vegas. Last night my brother and I visited the place to have some dinner and we were both extremely disappointed with the quality of the food. 
Positives:
Shakshuka was pretty good even though it was a bit salty. The warm pita was excellent. 
Negatives:
Shawarma was one of the priciest and one of the worst we have had. It's not made traditionally on the stacks and it was very chewy and not fresh at all. Our salad didn't even have a dressing on them. Just some iceberg lettuce, tomato, cucumber, and onions. Seasoned fries was clearly old. To top it off when we mentioned these to the waitress she insisted that the shawarma is really good and no one has ever had problems with it. I find that very hard to believe. 
It is really unfortunate that a place that used to be a gem as far as kosher food in Vegas has turned into such low quality place.  The only reason why this doesn't have a lower score is because of the pita and shakshuka."}
{"text":"Everything I had was absolutely delicious and the service was great!! Cute waiters that are funny and get your order right.... You can't go wrong with that!!! I asked for my waiter's recommendation and he gave me his recommendations for life. Too cute! Anyway, I had the Jerusalem Grill Mix which was awesome - came with beef kabob, chicken skewers, and chicken shawarma. I have never in my life had such delicious chicken, it was juicy and moist and tasted great! I also shared one of the unlimited salad combos with 2 friends and it was great! You get an assortment of 12 salad platters that keep coming as long as you still have room for it. It was cool to be able to try all the different types of dishes. I found a lot of new items that I loved! Finally, if you stop by I recommend the mango juice for your drink. It is by far the tastiest mango juice I have ever had!!! 

Hope this helps! I highly recommend it and will be coming back myself whenever I am in town!!"}

{"text":"I wanted a nice place in Vegas to have a good kosher dinner with my bf. BUt vegas doesnt have any nice or fancy kosher places. We ended up coming here. The interior is nice and modern. The workers are nice and friendly. All the reviews are saying this place is always packed and the food is so good but honestly i feel like they were paid to write those reviews. The place was EMPTY when we walked in on a thursday night.They have a 20 oz tomahawk steak on the menu, which is really the only reason we came here cause my bf wanted a good steak dinner. We ask the waiter about the steak and he says its amazing, you have to get this steak. Its very lean, no fat, no bone. This steak is a must. So my bf gets that steak and i ordered the Salmon which they claimed was a baked salmon. I got french fries and tabbouleh as my side dishes. We were starving!! THis place doesnt give you any break when you come in or any pre-meal treat. But they should. When out food finally came, the presentation of the steak was to die for, at least i thought it was. It was on a cutting board with a small salad next to it. Looked very nice and presentable. My bf started eating and i notice him cutting SO MUCH fat off of the steak. Literally more than half of the steak was fat. The waiter came by to see how everything was and my bf mentioned this wasnt a lean steak at all, the waiter looked like he didnt know what to say and said something like like oh it has a little fat. Uh no, it had a lot of fat. He went to the back to speak to someone and then just left us hanging. 

My salmon was just OK. I was expecting a grilled or baked piece of salmon and my fries and tabbouleh on the plate, but instead my salmon was 2 thin slivers of salmon cooked with a bunch of crap around it. There was a tomato, chick peas, green leafs of some sort. It looked as if the salmon was cooked in some sort of stew. My fries were wet and soggy from whatever was on the salmon. The salmon was bland, no taste. I only ate it because i was hungry. The tabbouleh was soooo tiny, omg. It was like 1 table spoon of tabbouleh which is disappointing cause i love tabbouleh. Anyways their tabbouleh was dry as hell and not that great. Its weird because when i ordered my meal the waiter asked me if i wanted my salmon on top of the tabbouleh... I would have died if my tabbouleh has the stew and chick peas from the salmon on it.

Once we flagged down the waiter and asked him for the check, he goes to get it and comes back to tell us hes taking 10% off the cost of the steak which was a joke. He acted like he was doing us a favor. It was like $6 or $7 our $80+ bill. This restaurant could have done a lot to make it right but they chose not to. 6 or 7 dollars off of my bill is an insult. You could have offered us something else off of the menu, you could have apologized for misinforming us about the steak and basically lying to us just to order the most expensive thing on the menu.Anything would have been better than acting like you were not at fault. Does the owner of this restaurant care that people are spending money like this at his establishment and then leaving hungry? We will never come back. 

Good thing i write reviews for all places i dine at, they deserve the 1 star"}
{"text":"Nice upscale Jewish classy restaurant. I was in Vegas last week for a week and ate dinner here every night. They have a good selection of a steak house and felafel house combined. Only issue was the prices are very high compared to any other kosher establishment. Also, they automatically add the tip in the bill, which I did not like. For example, I had to pay $3 for a side of babaganoush, should have been free of you ask me. Either way, I would probably return since there is no where else to eat in Vegas."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. ---such a go-to yelp line! ;)

Stopped in on a week day for dinner with a friend of mine. I knew about this place because my old coworker's husband is the one in the back who ensures all products are kosher. Otherwise, would be very difficult to spot along busy Decatur/Flamingo intersection. 

I got the salad w/ chimichurri steak on it, which ended up costing me $24 (I knew kosher food will be more expensive but geesh!). Friend got the shashuka w/ pita bread which she claimed was good. Service was a little slow, and we later came to find out that our waitress was the manager. She had some good recommendations and was pretty straight forward.

Ambiance is a little strange. It had potential of being a nice restaurant until they added the TV w/ sports. Lots of seating outside, w/ pretty string lights, but I would expect service to be even slower sitting out there.

All in all, good food but pretty pricey w/ slow service."}
{"text":"Jerusalem serves the moistest, brightest green falafel. The falafel may be the best in town but I need to revisit a few of my favorites just to be sure. The 15 all you can eat salads at Jerusalem are out of control. Not your traditional salads--more like, hm, an array of one-of-a-kind sides--some healthy, some earthy, some tangy. The most memorable part of my meal? Biting into a lemon rind that had been soaked in vinegar. Wow!"}
{"text":"I'm very picky when it comes to food, that being said: the place is nice and clean, we were welcomed with a big smile and warmth and the food was amazing!! I ordered a vegetable soup and beef in a pita bread.
Everything tasted amazing especially the french fries;) sooo good I recommend!!


Well,,,came in for the second time and my experience was completely different. Like bad different!
They were out of many items and the vegetable soup was untouchable and the burger came out dry and the couscous was cold and...ugh what a mess. Luckily the second burger came out perfect so I won't take all the stars back I'll leave 2 I think that's fair."}
{"text":"I've been eating in so many middle Eastern cuisine's but this one so far is the worst I have been , the service is terrible it's not even logical to wait so much time to get your food ready like seriously? The food was on the lower level but not what I expected at all . Stay away from the shawarma it's horrible !!!!!"}
{"text":"Just left this spot with prolly the worst experience.   We were seated and waiter over 10 min with no one came up to us, even for water.  They had people enough servers.  The food around  smelled really good. So I finally decided to raise my hand to get attention, and the server notices me and asks from far away if I wanted to order food.  Are effing kidding me? I said yes, no surprise there. And she says okay and doesn't come back.  We were sitting there like bunch of fools with nothing on our table and hungry.  
They really need better service here.  Food aren't cheap, therefore they can get better services. 
Please don't go there, if you are hungry."}
{"text":"This was my first experience in a kosher restaurant. I was a guest of two good friends from Israel and I'm always up for new experiences. With assistance from Yelp, I had a general idea of what I was in for and the reviews here are very helpful.

We started with excellent hummus and warm pita along with a deep fried beef roll. It had a name but I cannot recall what it is.

On the recommendation of our waiter, I ordered the Jerusalem Grill which was a combination of chicken shawarma and beef kabobs. I ordered the Israeli salad and couscous as my sides.  The servings were generous and delicious.

Service was attentive but I had to request refills of my beverage two to three times.

The enjoyment of the evening was with the conversation I had with my friends but the Jerusalem Grill gave us a delicious meal and informal setting in which to visit.

I chose 3 stars simply due to all of the options you have in Las Vegas (that is if you are not keeping kosher) it is difficult to consider this restaurant outstanding, but it is a strong 3 of 5 stars in my opinion."}
{"text":"Great service. No doubt BEST Israeli food in Vegas. Lior is the man! Thank you guys we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The shawarma mini tacos are excellent, and the burger is on point with crisp veggies and spicy fries. They also make fantastic sauces and dressings, recommend getting them on the side."}
{"text":"Anyone giving any kind of positive rating is a fraud or used to consuming overpriced sub-standard food!  Service - lousy!  Food was tasteless, poorly prepared.  How can Israeli place screw up basic schwarma is beyond me (as an example)  My grilled chicken was undercooked, Israeli salad had no salt, no taste....  Overpriced, below mediocre - STAY AWAY!  We all know of untrue, plain fraudulent reviews.  When I read people saying that this place is any good - all lies!"}
{"text":"OMG, what fabulous food!  Great place for a family outing or for a business meeting.  They have delicious food, all types of delicacies, and endless choices of food.  The owners are very involved in the restaurant and they make the place even more attractive.  Easy to find gluten free food like soups, Israeli salads, and meats.  Jerusalem Grill is our favorite meat restaurant."}
{"text":"Every time my girlfriend and a come to Vegas we eat here. The waitstaff is always nice and the food is pretty amazing. Go for the steak its worth every penny."}
{"text":"Had family in town and we decided to hit this spot. The place is nice the service was good considering there was like 12 of us. The food was good as well would go back and try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"so disappointed! food cold and disgusting!!! not worth the price of $28.99 ... tasted like left over meat!!! ambience terrible for this price @ lunch!!!"}
{"text":"very disappointed !! The food was not good and I was waiting for ever to get my dish while my friends already finish there's ! I will never ever recommend this place to know one , this place is a joke"}
{"text":"Really bad experience.  Asked for two waters and was charged $5 for bottled water without asking.  That's just wrong.  Shame on you for trying to jack up the bill like this.  I won't ever  be back because of this so maybe talk to your staff about this sort of thing.  The food I ordered was flavorless - almost no salt in the meat and no salt anywhere in sight.  That's usually easily fixed except in this case the service was really slow- we hardly saw our waitress and had to ask for everything.  

Also there is no lunch menu or if there is one it was not given to us.  I don't usually go to places that want charge $19-$35 per entr√©e for lunch.  I ordered what was essentially a couple of small of meat patties and some sides for almost $20."}
{"text":"When you are kosher you're choices unfortunately are very limited.  We went to Jerusalem Grill because it was close to the strip.  My husband ordered a mixed grill and the meat was half cooked, he didn't tell me this until his he had pains in his stomach.  I would have sent the meat back.  I ordered chicken breast, that was salted beyond belief and very tough and stringy.  There were flies everywhere.  I asked the waitress isn't there something you could do.  She replied what would you like me to do.  She took away our salads because the flies had made a home there and didn't offer to bring us another one.  She never came back to see if we needed anything because that would have interrupted"}
{"text":"WOW
We visited LV last weekend and we went into this restaurant pretty much at random. 
What a nice experience!
The place was clean and very welcoming. And best of all the food was EXCELLENT.
They didn't put the bill on the table with the food , they were waiting for us to finish the meal and for us to ask for the bill (which I consider a mark of politeness and helps me not to feel rushed out of the place).
The service was great 
Great job. Keep it up. 

I am going to send ANY one who will ask me where to eat good food in LV to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing Israeli food ! Sooo authentic reminds me of being in Israel. A must stop for Vegas on my
List"}
{"text":"Shuli 
Thank you so much for taking such wonderful care of our family during our vacation  in Las Vegas.
You and your staff were so very 
accommodating and informed about our special dietary needs. 
The food at the Jerusalem Grill was always delicious, fresh, properly prepared and a great value for the price. We highly recommend !"}
{"text":"Came to this restaurant on a whim while staying here for business. Service was fantastic, food was amazing. Atmosphere is friendly. Easy to tell that the staff cares about the food, as much as he customer. Will definitely be coming back here when in town again."}
{"text":"We visited Jerusalem restaurant on our visit to Vegas.
Everything we ordered was delicious and fresh.
We enjoyed every moment and recommend this kosher restaurant to anyone who wants to enjoy good food at reasonable prices in a pleasant atmosphere and great service."}
{"text":"Amazing service. Staff is super friendly. Food is great. Came here twice for dinner while in Vegas this week with relatives visiting from Israel.  Table of 8 each night and they took great care of us. The mushroom hummus is a must!!!!! Only kosher spot I would recommend in Vegas."}
{"text":"The best Israeli home cooking.. 
I could not finish my plate, and believe me, I tried!
The service was great and fast.
Will defiantly eat there again."}
{"text":"How disappointed am I? Extremely!! One of the highlights of my trips to LV is usually a stop by here...twice. So imagine my surprise when we arrived this time and the ENTIRE menu was changed.  No worries, everything else still looks the same. The only reason I  am giving 2 stars is because the shwarma was still very good even if I could only get it in a taco and not with my hummus!

It took 20 minutes to get drinks ordered and that is ridiculous in any half full restaurant.
After we finally ordered a young man attempted to deliver the wrong food to our table 3 times. Once the food was delivered we didn't see our waitress again until my husband flagged her down for the grossly overpriced check. 

New menu, mediocre food, bad service and $100 check for 2? No thanks!  Let me know when you fix it back otherwise if I am going to waste $100 in Vegas it will be at a craps table at least then I will be prepared to throw my money away!"}
{"text":"As a group of us were in Vegas for 3 nights for a convention, and since Las Vegas has Kosher restaurants and Nashville does not, I opted to change up our routine for the last night. Previously we had dined at Canaletto and Nobu but I felt that Jerusalem Grille might be a nice change of pace and of wallet.
Without trying to denigrate either of the other two restaurants, I will say that this was universally decided as our second best meal of the three - and it was $100 for the 4 of us instead of $300 or $400 of the two previous nights!
We all got their bottomless salad plates - pretty funny to call it bottomless since there about 12 of them and there is little to no way we could eat more than one, even though we did try. We also had the schwarma (amazing), the falafel (very good), and the schnitzel (eh).
The service here is a bit on the slow side, but they are very nice - a little Hebrew goes a long way. 
Next time I'm in Vegas, I will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Best Kosher Food in Las Vegas!
Great food! Great service! Awesome shawarma laffa! 
Also the shnitzel came out fresh and sizzling! Their couscous is way better then any place in New York! All of their bread is hand made and we walked in right when they were making fresh laffas!
Must come and try, seriously no point of going anywhere else."}
{"text":"This is MUST SEE in Vegas, Restaurant is so good that is always busy and this made me to give 4 stars. Sometimes waiting is long but... just wait, just watch :)

This is the main place where I eat during the Vegas visits, Schwarma is great, very good salads. Food on high level. Fresh vegetables, food quality is very good.

Prices are absolutely where they should be, not expensive, not overpriced and food is great.

What is really great about his place - SERVICE You are a Jew ! and You have Jews around you you feel there like home. People are nice, very helpful. I really enjoyed talking to wait stuff, they really make you feel welcome in this place.

{"text":"Wow!!!! I came across this restaurant on my recent trip to Vegas and I am so glad I did!!! Food was absolutely DELICIOUS!!! Generous portions all fresh, in nice presentation!! Great service too!! I just couldn't get enough which is why I went back the next night!! Definitely something to look forward to in my next Vegas trip. Already told all my friends about it :)"}
{"text":"Excellent place off the main beaten path of Las Vegas strip. Recommend by our friend, Avi, it didn't fall short. The people were very friendly and the food was fabulous! The Shawarma tacos were delicious as well as the mushroom hummus."}
{"text":"incredible food! Lovely experience and staff :) I highly recommend this restaurant to all."}
{"text":"Wow. I haven't felt this ripped off in awhile from a restaurant. I called this place at 10:15, yelp says they close at 11. Not true they now close at 10:30. If I knew that I probably would have skipped it. But I rolled the dice and placed my order. I was interested in the steak and chimmichuri sauce. I know I murdered that spelling. But I think you get the jist. So he proceeded to tell me it's 48.00. Remind you this is the first or second picture on yelp. And they have a 2 dollar sign price point. So I couldn't afford that this evening and asked the guy if he had any cheaper chicken dishes. Around the 15 dollar range. He said some kind of chicken I've never heard of. The guy was nice and trying to accommodate me. That's honesty why I didn't just hang up after the 48.00 steak. But I should have known. Looking back.... So long story short is I got chicken and rice with pita and cucumber salad. All included with meal. 25 and change. And then he charged me 3 dollars each for a coke. 6 total. my meal to 33 and some change. Not exactly sure because they kept my change. I'm looking for receipt. I think the reviews on here and bought and fake. And I will not be coming back. Pissed in Vegas."}
{"text":"Really fast and kind service, one of the best quality food I have ever tasted !
No doubt I'm coming back !"}
{"text":"Food is great if you like it right out of the microwave. Maybe it was due to us coming so early at 12 pm, but the mixed grill came out barely warm. The swarma wasnt even room temperature. They were quick to warm some more up. At that point we were already disappointed with the food and ready to leave. They did give us a discount on the bill considering 90% of the microwaved food was still on the plate. Definitely a pass."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience at Jerusalem Grill. Even though we were a large group and had forgotten to make a reservation we were able to be seated fairly quickly. Service was fast. Everyone enjoyed the food, even the picky eaters."}
{"text":"Very good food! Service is good. 
I like to come here and get the combination meal , all salads here are great, we getting catering every Friday for shabat"}
{"text":"Love this place! Food was super delicious and the service is great.  I was glad to find a good  authentic Israeli cuisine just like home:))"}
{"text":"I was very impressed with the delicious food and salads were amazing as well. The waiter was extremely friendly and the service was great. We tried other restaurants in Vegas and they don't compare to Jerusalem grill. We came back a second time the following day to enjoy another delicious meal. Highly recommend !!!"}
{"text":"I sat on the patio today at the Jerusalem Grill this afternoon for lunch.  It was a nice day and as I was the only one in the restaurant i was served quickly.  

i had a perigiyot in a laffa and it was ok.  While the flavours were great, the laffa was crumbly and much to large for my sandwich.  I found that most of the actual sandwich was laffa bread and not salad or the chicken.  

The fries they served were standard the side salads were great.

I'd go back this trip if I had to, but I think I'll try a few other places instead."}
{"text":"Loved the food. Got Moroccan cigars, falafel, matzo ball soup, and a chicken schnitzel entree that I shared with my friend. It tasted like a home cooked meal.

My friend and I will definitely come back. Highly recommend this place for fresh delicious food."}
{"text":"Funny that we started off the morning at the dairy restaurant next door and 12 hours later we arrive here at Jerusalem! Beni was helpful and honest about what was good to eat...he said EVERYTHING. Two of us had the chicken shwarma and one has the chicken schnitzel. Both were tasty and the portions were large. When we asked we received Tehila and harif with some warm pita. Typical noisy middle eastern restaurant with a lot of friendly homey atmosphere.  But if you were looking for a quiet romantic dinner...don't come! We'll be here for a few days and I expect we'll be back. Oh and I forgot..there is a 10% discount from Yelp when you order two entrees or more."}
{"text":"Schnitzel!  I was in Vegas for business and was luck to find Jerusalem Grill listed on Yelp.  It was the night of the Presidential Debates and EVERY customer was slowly savoring their dinners to listen to the television.

The wait staff is lovely and accommodating. The restaurant is located in a mall, so parking spaces were plenty.  There is a liquor store in the mall so I was able to buy wine to take back to my hotel.  Vegas used to have LOTS of reasonable eateries - NOT in 2012.  Cocktails that were free years ago now cost you a good $15 (watererd down).  

 Jerusalem Grill has great prices and lovely middle-eastern cuisine.  YOu could come with your family or as a single person and feel totally comfortable!"}
{"text":"IT'S OFFICIAL, Jerusalem Grill is a MUST STOP for us. The price is a tad on the high side, the service is top notch, the FOOD, the food is definitely one of the best of its kind. 

We love the Hummus ($8), Jerusalem Grill Mix ($28) which features grilled chicken, swarmarma, and beef kabob served with basmati rice and house salad. The portion is generous and so are the flavors!!

We are in town twice or three times a year, and Jerusalem will be the highlight of these upcoming trips."}
{"text":"Fantastic!!!
Falafel And hummus platter = beautiful presentation excellently seasoned!

Chicken skewers with Israeli salad = absolutely delicious. I typically pass on dark meat but was hesitant of the other items on the menu so opted for the chicken skewers. Absolutely no regrets! Amazing! I will lose that \"hesitancy\" and venture out to try other items next time! 

A++!"}
{"text":"Definitely some of the best Mediterranean food I have had in Las Vegas.  Its better than Paymons for sure.  I had the baby chicken well seasoned very delicious."}
{"text":"The place is dirty they Handel the money then they touch your food without gloves or washing hands yak, never go back again"}
{"text":"I always go to Nina's next door for their FABULOUS SUSHI, but today I had a business lunch and went to The Jerusalem Grill.  First of all, it REALLY impressed my business associate.  He raved and raved about their lentil soup.  He said it was the best he had ever had.  So I ordered some and it was really good.  He had hummus and shwarma and was very pleased.  I had the little chicken thighs in a pita.  It was yummy!  The service is unusually prompt for a Kosher restaurant in Las Vegas.  It was overall a very successful dining experience.  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Felt compelled to write a review for this place. Great food, great service, portions are huge, and all things considered very reasonably priced. If you don't stop by when you are in Vegas, you'll be missing out. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I come here every time I'm in town for business. Usually good food but slow service and short staffed. This time it was amazing. Not only is the food delicious but fast courteous service with a smile. The burger was thick and juicy and the seasoned fried were awesome. The chicken shawarma was great as usual. I will be recommending this place for sure. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed eating here 2x over my past Vegas trip. Awesome food and service. Definitely recommend it to those traveling to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"The $8 falafel sandwich was good with green cabbage and hummus, made a filling lunch on the go.  But aside from the sandwiches, everything here is wayyyyyy too pricey.  I paid $9 for beef cigars, and it was four tiny rolls of beef fried in flaky dough.  Put together, they're like one egg roll's worth of food.  I literally laughed out loud when I opened the container and saw how little that $9 bought.  :-("}
{"text":"The place was mobbed, loud, very warm and the tables were so tight my son was practically rubbing elbows with strangers.  We made the best of it by introducing ourselves to everyone around us.  There were 3 servers for 100 customers.   Be prepared to wait.  

We were told the difference between theHamburger entree and the children's hamburger is the following:
The adult hamburger is half a pound, while the kids hamburger is a quarter of. A pound.  Seems fairly reasonable right?!  We laughed hysterically when the kids opened their buns and discovered literally half a hamburger patty.  How challenging is it to mold 1/4 pound patties?!  Apparently they simply cut the 1/2 pound adult--size hamburgers for the kids.  Strange, but tasty.

They claim the food comes with French fries --- VERY small portions.... We counted approximately 18 fries per customer.  perhaps a small handful--- not a true restaurant size portion.

The best bargain/special at the Jerusalem Grill is the unlimited salad plate for an additional 3.99 per person, two person minimum.  Sounds pretty straight forward right?!

WRONG!

It took two servers, and the owner 30 minutes to clarify....  We were a party of eight, and two of us wanted the unlimited salad special.  But, NO this was NOT permitted.

I will clarify the policy to save you a lot of time and aggravation:

If you want to order the unlimited salad special EVERYONE in your party MUST order an entree AND add the $3.99 unlimited salad PER PERSON! 

If you are a party of 5 prepare for everyone to order entrees and add the 3.99 on top of  it, per person.... IF you are dining alone, you are FORBIDDEN to order the unlimited 3.99 salad.

We found the policy incredibly disturbing.  Sorry all you single,divorced, widowed people...NO 3.99 salad special for you.  We felt like characters in a Seinfeld episode or a Woody  Allen film.  

Jerusalem Grill is truly an alternate universe.
The food  was tasty.   It was fresh, cooked and obviously Glatt kosher.  

The hostess who seated us was exhausted, overworked, frazzled and a little brusque.  Clearly the owners wife.  She really needs more help.  It might have been nice to be welcomed with a smile and perhaps a cup of ice water while we waited.  It was over 100 that day.

I actually felt sorry for her.  However, we didn't drive all the way there to be snapped at when we made multiple attempts to order the bottomless salad special.

I believe this restaurant is worth the trip.  Especially if you are going off your diet to indulge while on vacation...  The 18 French fry serving is surely only 4 points on weight watchers?!

Whatever you do, smile, take some deep cleansing breaths and DO NOT, under any circumstances attempt to order the $3.99 bottomless salad special."}
{"text":"Disappointed. I've been to Jerusalem and know its cuisine well. This was a letdown. Too expensive for what you get as well.

I suppose if prices were more reasonable the food quality wouldn't disappoint as much. But when you pay four star prices for two star quality, it's hard to swallow.

Gave it three stars instead of just two because service was decent."}
{"text":"Very recommend! My third time eating here and I'm definitely coming back. Best mediterranean restaurant in town! The food is delicious and the staff are very nice."}

{"text":"Falafel platter was pretty big. But the fries weren't very good. The baklava wasn't that great & over priced. 
Servers were friendly."}
{"text":"I am vegetarian and very rarely eat meat, when I do I make sure it's kosher. I had the chicken kabob and was given meat that wasn't fully cooked. They took it back and recooked it and it lost all the flavor. The chicken was not good quality, the texture was not right. My bf ordered the steak and wasn't happy with it. They gave a discount which was nice of them.  

Two stars because the hummus with mushrooms was very tasty. I would recommend that."}
{"text":"I cannot believe all the incredible flavors and variety I got to try all in one sitting!
The staff here is so professionally trained to help you customize your experience!
I loved that it's only 5 minutes away from the Venetian Hotel just right off the Strip!

The moment we walked in we were asked on on our preference on where we liked to sit.
We were explained the menu so precisely.
My wife really enjoyed all of their vegetarian dishes, and the 6-Hour Marinated Short Ribs were insanely flavorful soft and juicy!

The atmosphere here is classy and warm, you feel you are at a high end restaurant but at the same time there is a moms touch in the house.
They have scented candles all over the restaurant and they dim the lights in the evening where a wonderful small jazz singer is playing the saxophone!

I have eaten at every kosher place, and I have to title Jerusalem Grill & Bar as the most professional, tastiest, and freshest restaurant in Las Vegas!

Thank you for such a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Got take out from here.  Had some excellent mushroom hummus and nice grilled chicken salad.  People who work there are friendly and take-out order was ready in less than 10 minutes.  Definitely will be going back here and probably trying their  place next door."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 0 stars. First off, this is the worst customer service in Vegas. They have no idea how to greet, take your order, or bring you extra items: ketchup, napkins, etc. The FIRST time we went here we were waiting forever for someone to take our order. The guy forgot our ketchup and took forever to bring our check not to mention he was not friendly. Since I love chicken schnitzel we went back a second time. BIG MISTAKE!!!! My fiance is Israeli and he thinks this is the worst customer service too! We went and she told us to sit wherever we wanted (hmm) After 5 MINUTES we left!!! NOONE came to even take our drink order! They should be embarrassed they are operating a restaurant in Las Vegas its pathetic. DO NOT COME HERE! On top of that they are pricey! Our tab the first time was close to $80! For decent food and terrible service! The appetizer wings were gross too. Do not waste your money here."}
{"text":"Great food great service. Love family owned businesses and this is no exception. Try the salad bar you won't regret it"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! I'm a big fan of falafel and I can eat it every day. This place always gives us extra sauce free of charge, and makes sure our falafel pitas are made properly even during Shabbat Fridays when they are the busiest! We order every Friday for lunch here and work and it's one of my favorite traditions. I haven't tried anything else on their menu but I doubt it's better than their falafel!"}
{"text":"Authentic and casual. One of my favorite lunch spots off the strip. I feel like I'm in Israel"}
{"text":"Best food ever!!!!! I had food this great in Tel Aviv.  The hummus is so fresh. Best bread. Loved the spicy red sauce, it's so authentic. Love the amba sauce, as it is made fresh. The owner Lior is so cool, really polite and knows so much about authentic cooking. Best place in Vegas for Israeli food. I would come here all the time. As a vegetarian/vegan, I am so in love with the food here. Also, plenty of options for gluten free. I love that the restaurant is very accommodating to vegetarians.   Really cannot wait to eat here again. BEST HUMMUS EVER!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! 

I'm a local and come here all the time! I absolutely love it and it just keeps getting better and better each time!!"}
{"text":"I know Israeli food, and this place is pretty good.
It has a very casual atmosphere, but that's how it should be.
They have excellent felafel, shwarma, hummus, techina, pita, and all of the salads that you'd expect.
I was there with a big party (7 or 8 people), but we didn't order any steak or chicken, because you can get that anywhere.
I would recommend just getting the foods listed above, because I haven't tasted anything better out here.
The service is very friendly and most of the staff speaks Hebrew, which adds to the overall authenticity. 
I'll be honest...The prices were higher than I anticipated, but my friends are kosher and they said that the prices were in line with other kosher restaurants.
So, as not to insult them, I let them pick up the tab.
If any other kosher friends or relatives come to visit, you can bet that we'll go back."}
{"text":"So I hate going to restaurants in Vegas and I never wanted to go to a restaurant to Vegas but I was kind of forced to since I had to take a client out and I only keep kosher. I have been traumatized for the last five years since from many of the restaurants they keep on opening and closing on some that may still be in business. However I must say I found a new home in Vegas where I can feel the comfort of my living room and dining room home freshly cooked food. The food here is amazing I will definitely be ordering food from now on to my hotel room as well as feeling confident to bring my clients here. I have to truly say that show warm a grill in Las Vegas has quality food with the most amazing customer service I have ever seen in the last five years of me attending Vegas tradeshows. I have spoken to many friends and understand that Vegas has a kosher issue but this will surely satisfy all your expectations."}
{"text":"Of all the Kosher establishments I've been in to across the country, This is the tastiest and most well run restaurant. As expected there was a wait to be seated but we were abe to get a seat by the bar. We had a very friendly waitress who was very helpful and let us substitute as we wanted. The chummus and mushrooms  was amazing and sooo fresh.  The burgers were cooked perfectly and seasoned really well! I look forward to coming back to Jerusalem bar and grill every time I visit Vegas."}
{"text":"BEST kosher place in VEGAS!!!!!!

We got the beef humus which was AWSOME!
I personally got the harrisa burger which was soo good !
The beef baklava is just a dream plate... food is really amazing here.  
The service was great , everything came so quickly to the table , great atmosphere, you can really get a Las Vegas feeling with the true taste of the Israeli kitchen , thank you Jerusalem grill we will definitely meet again!!!"}
{"text":"OMG! Honestly, I am a tremendous hummus snob and am very particular about my hummus. This is absolutely the best in town. The shawarma tacos were phenomenal and the blended lemonade with mint was insane! I don't live anywhere near here but will make the trek to come back often!"}
{"text":"Favorite food? Well, that's a tough question, but banchan (delicious Korean side dishes) and falafel would definitely be contenders, and somehow Jerusalem Grill comes close to delivering both. No, it isn't some inventive Korean-Israeli fusion spot, but they have the option of adding bottomless salads to your meal! These tasty little suckers are pretty much the equivalent of Korean banchan. Granted, you have to pay for them, but they are bottomless! (Look how beautiful they are in my picture.)

I have never experienced bottomless Israeli salads, so perhaps I am overly excited by this. Either way, there were some tasty numbers in the spread, including plenty that was pickled and spiced, a perfect egg salad and a corn creation. There were so many! I wish I could go back and just eat the salads. In fact, I may try that soon. 

The bread was without question delicious- hearty and with a nice grilled flavor. For an entree, I ordered falafel, and they were pretty good. I thought they were a tad small and a bit overfried, but the taste was fine.

With the addition of the bottomless salad, the meal was a little more than I might have expected to pay for a falafel dinner, but it is hard to place a value on those salads! The atmosphere is casual and homey like a familiar neighborhood place. I definitely sensed there were regulars, and our service was charming, even if it was a little laid back.  

Again, the mere existence of the salads may be swaying my judgement a teeny bit, but I definitely think Jerusalem deserves a visit so you can at least be in the presence of such beautiful vegetables just once."}
{"text":"I can't help but laugh at that \"Shmendrick\" that gave this place a 1 Star; Many factors go into my review; But - Anyways; Despite an \"Authentic\" Israeli Argument that transpired during tonight's dinner and the \"Israeli Service\"; we had a great evening. Food was very good.

Don't be a \"Schmuck\" this isn't a steak house; Be smart & get the Israeli Mixed Grill; it was excellent. We really enjoyed the Felafel.

This is the closest to Israel you get without leaving Las Vegas - LOL!

I highly recommend. Just pay attention to your bill and make sure you present your Yelp coupons ahead of time. 

Whatever you do, don't drink the tap water - get the bottled. You will enjoy!

\"Tapas\" all looked great."}
{"text":"The falafel pita was great! I loved it! I wouldn't go there for the fries though, kinda soggy (but still good enough to eat!) Everything there looked so fresh! Will definitely go back."}

Other kosher places they fill up your plate & you can have extra sides. Service was pretty slow. They had one waiter. The prices didn't match the menu from the receipt. Automatic charge for gratuity."}

{"text":"I would like to be able to give this place more stars, but our service was terrible. The food is great, their falafel is like no other. Our waitresses were really not in tune with our needs. We had to ask for beverage refills and for our check. I am totally down with family restaurants, but I always get uncomfortable when family members (children especially) can be seen coming and going and conducting family affairs. I feel like I'm invading their home rather than being a guest. Not to mention the 2 crackheads out front arguing was not exactly awesome..."}

I didn't like the first time, the shawarma was to much sweet to me. but in the second time, the hamburger was very very good! it was a big burger and they put a lot of french frise in the plate. I recommend on the hamburger and also on the hummus with mushrooms. like"}
{"text":"Some of the negative remarks here had me nervous, but the reviews of the other kosher places in Vegas had me even more nervous, so I decided to risk it and go, and bring 5 non-kosher eating colleagues. 

Suffice it to say, we were quite satisfied. 

The ambiance is very plain, very much like an israeli \"steakiada\", but it was clean and well lit. Perfectly fine. 

We started either various Hummus platters and then had soups and various different main dishes - steak, schnitzel, Schwartz, etc

All the food was good and portions were generous. 

Yes, It is pricey, but all kosher places are. Don't think it was beyond the range given that caveat. 

The servers were native Israelis, very fun, helpful and friendly. Service was quick and efficient. 

All in all, I completely recommend it... Again, given what it is. This isn't meant to be a classy joint but it isn't a fast food place either."}

A little more upmarket than the other kosher places in town.
Great location for tourists (near the Palms), excellent food"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff, nice atmosphere. Had schwarma, burger, and humus plate. Everything was very good. Spacious place with comfortable seating. Looking forward to coming back here next time."}
{"text":"The food is really good but I only give them 3 stars because they've seemed to have run out of half the items on the menu. Two of the appetizers we wanted, they didn't have. My friend tried to order a salad that they didn't have. Then they ran out of salad dressing. They have five desserts printed on the menu but the girl working said that they didn't have any of those and hadn't ever had them since she started working there. 
When you order a soda, on the menu it states that you have the option of getting a fountain soda or a can. They fail to tell you that the soda fountain is broken so you are charged for a can, which is more expensive. Why, I have no idea. 
Please, for the love of God, print new menus! It was so frustrating because it seemed as if every item we asked about on the menu was unavailable. At least have menus that reflect what products you have available."}
{"text":"I love this place! I live in Santa Monica, CA and travel to Vegas for work around 3 times a month. I try my best to come here at least 5-7 times a month. The staff is so nice and friendly that I've became very good friends with them now. The food is what got me in the beginning. The shwarma is the bom! And the beef kabob and the shnizel sandwich all either on baguette or lags bread. Mmmm. I absolutely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Truly best Israeli restaurant in town .Now they even got upgraded the place looks nice and bigger with excellent service and delicious dishes.Little pricey but worth it ."}
{"text":"Got turned away at 9:30, the sign says 9:45.  Guy in charge In a bull rush towards me and rather rudely: \"Sorry, the rabbi is here and he decided to close the place early.\"  Hostess, while looking at the clock and in the middle of boss man's statement: \"But it's only...\".  
Needless to say, I will not be returning.  Besides the place is a cramped cafe/diner and I didn't smell any food in the air.  The only thing in the air was boss man's nose: dark heavy set fellow with charcoal grey hair and hebrew/mideast accent."}
{"text":"It has been a long time since I have had fresh made Lafa or pita ;)
The food and service were  excellent."}
{"text":"What an amazing experience that was.
Me and my family visit Vegas and we order a delivery from Jerusalem grill they arrived in less than 20 minutes and the food was fabulous!!
They gave as exactly what we ordered and we enjoyed from every bite!!
Thank you so much this place is a must!!
We definitely going to come back."}
