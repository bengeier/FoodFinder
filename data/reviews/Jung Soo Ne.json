{"text":"We came for the raw crab experience and got it.  The raw soyasauce crabs were interesting, a little salty and goes well on rice.  We got a few other dishes as well that were okay and a little pricier than other korean restaurants.  The service - they forgot my soju that we ordered and charged us for it.. they were very apologetic for it though."}
{"text":"This place is hidden in the corner so I didn't know it existed until my friend took me. I've been going back for their don Katsu ever since. They give you enough for 2 people and the prices are reasonable. It's definitely better than some other korean restaurants out there."}
{"text":"I used to be a regular patron when it was located at Richmond Hill.  Now that it's moved closer, I can go to this place ALL THE TIME!  This is by far the most authentic Korean food North Toronto has to offer.  The side dishes are unique and different from other Korean restaurants and they do not skimp.  I judge a place by my baseline which is tofu soup and it could even be better than Buk Chang Dong.  Every dish I've ordered here has been delicious and prepared without MSG.  When something tastes this good and homey without MSG, it is a keeper.  Homey may impart a less than stellar connotation, but you want to go out to a Korean restaurant and taste dishes like your mother made for you at home.  Not loaded with chemicals.  It is high praise that the dishes taste homey!  The place is a bit hidden but it's in the same plaza as Sunny in the NorthEast corner, so you can't miss it!"}
{"text":"Been coming to this place since they were located in Richmond hill. So happy they came down closer to where we live. They have the best banchans/side dishes. So healthy and fresh. It reminds me of eating mom's food... It's that good. Love their Chung Gook Jang too. Almost everyone that comes in gets this jiigae."}
{"text":"We ordered pork bone soup and tofu soup. The food came on time with a generous selection of side dishes. We especially enjoyed the side dishes. The main dishes were alright. The gentleman who served us was very diligent. I would like to come back next time I feel like eating Korean food."}
{"text":"A very clean and comfortable setting.  Delicate glasses for the tea and country deco with attention to details.  We ordered the following at dinner tonight:
- Pork Bone Soup (8.99) - Delicious soup base.
- Seafood Tofu (9.99) - one of the best tofu soups I have had, the soup was full of flavor.  It was quite spicy, I would ask for less spicy soup next time.  Otherwise highly recommend it.
- Bulgogi - (10.99) - very generous portion and pretty tasty.
We will definitely return since the place is clean, service is friendly and portion was reasonable.  A very enjoyable dining experience.
Thank you :)"}
{"text":"Came for Lunch on Sunday. The place is fairy small, but we were able to get a table right away. The workers were really friendly, greeting us and bringing us to our table. 

We ordered budae jigae (the military soup). It was more than enough for 2 adults. No complains about the food at all, as we enjoyed it very much. The service was great, even though basically one girl was serving all tables it seemed like. She was very friendly, asking us to let her know if we need more side dishes. 

Overall it was great service, food and price ($28 for the soup)."}
{"text":"Solid Korean joint. Good food. We don't like the authentic Korean dishes so we can only rate based on the bim bim bap and Bulgogi."}
{"text":"Jung Soo Ne was dead on a Saturday night around 7 pm.  There was only 1 table inside when we came.  Price here is more then the average Korean restaurant. Found a hair in one of the Banchan.  Notified the server and the didn't say a word just took it away and never gave us a nice dish to replace. Won't be coming back here as the service was bad even thou it wasn't busy and food is below average in the area where there are plenty of better options."}
{"text":"3.5
Food is pretty good. Six solid side dishes. 
My boyfriend and I really enjoy the soft tofu soup, pork bone soup, and the spicy blue crab! The spicy blue crab is amazing : ) 
Service isn't bad either. 

This restaurant used to be at Yonge and Major Mac but moved to Bathurst and steeles now. Business seems to be better as it was a packed house tonight. 

Stews come with purple rice."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in the neighbourhood!! I am confident to say I'ma frequent customer now. This place deserve more attention!! I had never realized seafood pancake can taste so good it's almost additive. It's crispy and loaded with seafood. The dipping sauce brings out the flavour even more. The soya sauce crab is a seasonal Korean delicacy but not for everyone. It's a raw crab with marinated in soya sauce and wine for a week. I had it twice and both times I came the blue crab was loaded with roe. Kimchi fried rice is very flavourful. The Budae jjigae is pretty standard. A nice touch on the first day of snow this year. 

Service is very friendly. The booth seating are wide it's comfortable even when you have lots of food on the table. The store is located in the far right corner of a quiet strip mall which a bit hard to find.. What I love about this location is LOTS OF PARKING SPOTS which is rare for Korean restaurants in the Yonge/Finch area. The check-in name on Instagram is quite confusing it is \"Jungsoone Bonga\" which is different from what appears on Yelp. This is my favourite Korean place and I'll come here regularly.mm"}
{"text":"Correct my words: recently ordered seafood pancake twice and everytime i got one overburnt, not happy about this."}
{"text":"Food was average and the service was pretty bad. You order and they bring you the food, once you get your order that's the last time you see your servers. They only seem to be friendly with their regulars. I only saw them attending to the older Korean people, save your self some time and go elsewhere as the food is average at best."}
{"text":"Okay food, would normally rate 3 as it's average but the owner walking around was really annoying as shit while eating.
Also owner is only friendly to frequent customers it seems like, which is pretty much generic korean old man."}
{"text":"This is an authentic Korean restaurant.  I have been here two times and both times were great.  I love their raw crab with soy sauce, seafood pancake, and tofu soup.  The tofu soup is very rich in flavours, a bit on the spicy side tho.  Service was also excellent.  I will definitely come back ago."}
{"text":"Can't comment on the authenticity of this place beyond mentioning that it seems to be family owned and they all speak Korean XD

Food is not amazing, but not bad either. Portion sizes and taste are standard and same as the Korean restaurants downtown. We didn't like the raw crab as much as we thought we would based on all the online hype. For $16 the portion size was tiny; in particular we couldn't access much of the crab meat in the shells. My seafood vegetable tofu stew was pretty good! A bit spicy, lots of squid. The seafood pancake was also a highlight. It was less battered than what we normally see at Korean restaurants and has big chunks of squid. It was also a big portion, great for sharing with multiple people.

The banchan (side dishes) were big portions and tasty.

Probably won't be back since so far out of the way and food is generic."}
{"text":"Very very tasty pork bone soup.  You can tell this place is very authentic. We've come here numerous times already and could be our go to place for pork bone soup."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to go to for Korean food! I had the pork bone soup which was very good and very generous in its portioning. You are offered 6 different side dishes with your meals, more than any other Korean restaurant I have gone to, each better than the next. We especially loved the eggplant! Service was very prompt and very good. It's in a more industrial part of town and a bit hard to find but it is definitely a hidden gem! 

We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Hard to decide how to rate this place. I was extra sensitive to smells today and the smell today was reminiscent of sweaty gym clothes with sprinkles of savory soup. Decor was a combination of wooden booths (nice) married with other decor that just didn't fit together. Washrooms were clean.

There was one server for the entire restaurant and some guy sitting by the door pointing people to tables when they arrived. After our food arrived our sever did not come to our table again until we called her over for the bill. Too bad as I wanted a glass of water during my meal, but she was overrun.

The food:
Banchan was plentiful
Pork bone soup was very flavourful 4/5
Dumplings were deep fried, served with cabbage, ketchup sand mayo. Meh 2/5
Seafood soup had delicious broth. The noodles were kind of gummy and the bits of seafood very small in size. Huge and stayed steamy. 3/5

Overall a 3. Maybe it was an off night for them."}

Pros:
Very well done Korean cuisine
Friendly service

Cons:
No steamed ribs available (very minor issue)

This place is a hidden gem and I have Yelp to thank for me finding it.  Jung Soo Ne is an excellent Korean restaurant that should be on every Korean cuisine's lovers list. Honestly, if they had any rendition of steamed beef ribs (my go to order at Korean restaurants), it would easily have been a 5.  

This place has a very homey feel to it.  It's a very comfortable setting to have a meal in.  As you can see from my picture of the interior, they probably have kept those street light fixtures from the previous business.  It stands out a little bit and is something you notice throughout your meal.

We ordered the gamjatang, galbitang and a seafood noodle.  Each order comes with 6 very well prepared side dishes.  I only wished the kimchi was cut into smaller pieces as they don;t give you any scissors to do so yourself.  The food comes out boiling hot as you can see from my pics.  They are very well made.  I loved the broth in my galbitang and the beef was basically fall off the bone tender.  The gamjatang was great as well, I felt there was a bit of sweetness to the soup.  It wasn't my all time favourite, but it was definitely up there.  The noodle soup was also very good.  The broth is very rich and they give you a ton of noodles.  The portion of seafood is also very good for the price you're paying.

Service here was very good throughout our visit.  English is definitely not their first language but they did a great job and were very friendly.  They were very accommodating to any needs we had for our little one as well.  

This is already now one of my go to Korean restaurants in the area.  I will definitely be back and I recommend this place to everyone who loves Korean cuisine."}
{"text":"For times that I am craving real, authentic, genuine Korean food, this is where I go.

It is a bit far for us to drive, but worth it.

The level of gochu is exactly like in Korea.  Its like getting off the plane in Incheon, having your first chigae and realizing - yes - this is the correct level of gochu-garu.  You mouth, tongue and palate are tingling and there is a symphony in your mouth!  

They are known for their home-made (jip) kimchi.  Long huge pieces that you stuff in your mouth - mmmm.  Yesterday, I had their yeolmu-kimchi mul nyengmyeon.  OMG.  Spouse had his usual yuk-kae-jang.  This is a nice restaurant.  Comfortable.  I have known the owners for almost 25 years.  Never a disappointing meal at this place."}
{"text":"I have been a regular customer of Jung Soo Ne when it was in Richmond Hill. They offer solid Korean food. The food are homey style which has no MSG and delicious. I always judge a Korean restaurant by their side dishes; they are yummy and home-made.Side dishes selection will change according to the seasons.

My family's favourites are Pork Cutlet, spicy squid, seafood noodles, seafood pancakes..

This Jung Soo Ne serves raw blue crab with soya sauce. I tried the Blue Crab Stew; the crabs don't have a lot of meat after making the stew but the soup tastes very fresh and \"sweet\" from the crab.

The portion of dishes is very generous in general."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I came here for to try raw crabs. It was sure delish. The raw crabs is a seasonal item and isn't always available. Make sure you call Ahead of time to make sure they have the item in stock! 

We ordered the family combo for $75, which includes the raw crabs, a spicy hot pot soup, seafood pancake and a mix meat dish. This set was a great deal which allowed us to try the crabs & still have a plentiful dinner at a decent price 

[ Dishes ]
The texture of the raw crab is not fully what I expected since I'm used to have it cooked. The dipping sauce that comes with it is a great compliment! After getting it used to the texture (which is a creamy softer texture) it's quite delish. 

The spicy chicken hot pot that we got is like a version of Pork-bone but with spicy chicken. Warning: it is pretty spicy. Next time , I would choose to get the soup in mild. 

Seafood pancake, just plentiful and delish!!"}
{"text":"This place is known as the healthiest Korean restaurant. Low in sodium.  You will only see Koreans here . They also have \" apres \" golf meals for party of 4 and more ..Call before you go since they are closed on Mondays !"}
{"text":"Jung Soo Ne is nothing fancy. Traditional Korean staple food that prepares with love and care just like how Korean ma would have make at home everyday.

Banchan were fresh. Bulgogi with Rice, Soon Tofu and Dumplings were all tasty. 

Raw Crab Marinated in Spicy Sauce sounds interesting that would be something to try for the next visit.

Lunch Special available which is a $1 or $2 off the regular price.

Worth coming if you want some solid Korean Comfort food just like home."}
{"text":"I was blown away the first time I tried the classic Denjang here.
(Fermented bean soup aka korean Miso)

Quite frankly, I think this place makes best Denjang & side dishes in Toronto.

Seasoned crabs are quite a catch also, though quite pricey as well :(

Waitress are one of the best trained / pro-service, not so much with the family-staff girl though :p

All in all, if you want the most authentic *standard* Korean meal, this place is for you."}
{"text":"Very quiet spot, nicely decorated, lots of Korean grandmothers eating there! That's how you know it's good right? I also liked the transparent glass tea cups."}
