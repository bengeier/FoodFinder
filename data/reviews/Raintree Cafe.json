{"text":"Our food was presented very nicely, quick, and tasted amazing! The servers were attentive and we were very satisfied. I will come here again"}
{"text":"What a wonderful place. I had the Swedish pancakes they were wonderful! Chewy in the middle and crispy crunchy on the outside edges. Comes with some kind of berry jelly and sprinkled with white powdered sugar. The wait staff was friendly polite and quick. The outside patio seating has these wonderful circular misters. They open up at 6:30 AM Monday through Sunday"}
{"text":"Simple place with great hospitality. It's odd to walk into a hotel for a restaurant, if you're not staying here, but the food is good and it's nice and quiet to where you can have conversations with the people you're dining with...imagine that!"}
{"text":"My co worker and I have been enjoying our week long stay at the holiday inn! You can call us raintree cafe regulars at this point. Our favorite spot has been in the rain tree cafe. We've enjoyed breakfast in the cafe as well as room service. The morning sliders with hashbrown potatoes are the best. The staff is very friendly and courteous. The lunch menu is great. So far we've both had the half sandwich and salad which hits the spot, and today we tried the sliders and pub chips. Both were delicious and quick. Their dinner selection is also very good. On my first night here I treated myself to the Monterey chicken. Wow! Tonight we decided to have happy hour appetizers and cocktails. Try the Kentucky mule and shrimp cocktail. The bartender, servio is very attentive and friendly. It's very convenient to have such amazing food located in the hotel. Be sure to stay in one night on your trip and give this restaurant a shot! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"13 year old and i both had biscuits n gravy 2 over easy eggs and bacon. It was  very good... fresh biscuits, creamy, but not overly viscous sausage gravy and 4 strips of bacon.  The bacon wasn't very crisp in fact it seemed like it came from a buffet but it was ok. I should say we showed up 15 min before end of breakfast service.
Bright clean atmosphere and friendly service.  We will go back."}
{"text":"New little cafe bar that opened up right up the street inside the Holiday Inn. Have a daily happy hour from 4:30 to 6:30 with half price appetizers and drink specials. Super conveniently close. They also have good breakfast lunch and dinners. Surprisingly good quality food prepared with care."}
