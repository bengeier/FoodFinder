{"text":"ADOBO experience? more like The Old Experience, coming in I was trying to go to that good Mexican restaurant beside it called ORO AZUL but too bad it was closed, so we decided to go to Adobe experience right? Nuh uh, we ordered an appetizer called Kwek Kwek, it's a deep fried quail egg, when it came to the table, the outside part wasn't even hot, I then took a bite, it burnt my freaking mouth, obviously it was microwaved, Adobo is Filipino for chicken stew, we ordered 2 of the original dishes, the chicken wasn't even in the stew, really bland, my friends rice was the bbq chicken and the rice was sour AF. place was nice and the decorations make you feel like it's summer time, but the food? no way sorry adobo experience. better off eating at a Filipino potluck.   p.s it was so bad the people beside us didn't even finished, they came in the restaurant at the same time as us and we both left at the same time. I ended up asking them \"how was the food did you like it?\" surely he said \"....Noooo, way to bland.\" Adobo experience in one word? BLAND the price ain't so bad but it doesn't make up for the food they make... SORRY, but not sorry"}
{"text":"We're from Toronto and tried a few Filipino restaurant here in Calgary. Tried this one because of some good reviews. The place was small a bit of native accent but not really appealing but not really bad as well. My friend ordered Crispy Pata, her sister ordered Chopseuy or mixed vegetables and I ordered this \"Crispy Adobo\" and two Garlic rice. The waitresses were great when it comes to customer service.  When the food came it was served on a wood plate with \"Banana leaves\" nice presentation. However, instead of serving us Garlic rice it was steam rice so I noted that to the one who served it whose apparently one of the cook or chef (Simon) and said he can change it but I said that is fine. After a few minutes Simon came back with one cup of garlic rice to compensate and that was nice.  The Crispy Pata was cooked to perfection and not dry like many other Filipino restaurant will served.  The Chopseuy was ok but not great. The Crispy Adobo which I would expect to great as their restaurant was named after the famous dish, I would think it was delicious. It's actually fried pork chop that was topped with adobo sauce. The pork chopped was so dry. I thought it was an adobo that they let the sauce reduced until it gets dried but was not. I will not order it again nor recommend it. It also mentioned on the menu with rice and vegetables but when it came the \"vegetables\" that they said was actually \"sliced lettuce and carrots\" which should be mentioned as green salad instead of veggies.  I will go back to this place because of excellent Customer service,making sure that you have everything okay and for Crispy Pata. Oh yes, the Leche Flan is good as well.  I was told that this is new, therefore there's a lot of room for improvements. In addition, the price is good as compared to other Filipino restaurants I've been to so far. I would think Calgary will be cheaper but Boy oh Boy, so expensive as compared to Toronto.  7 seas restaurant still my number one so far and this will be second for now."}
{"text":"Tried this little gem today - just stopped in for appies with the sister-friends. The appetizer platter fed three of us for $14. The chef came out, asked if we had any questions and described all the delicious tidbits that were served up on a mancala game board! There were eight different items (wings, spring rolls, tofu bites, mango relish, just to name a few) and two dipping sauces. It was delish. We then decided to share a dessert: not-too-sweet, creamy Buko Pandan  It was a scrumptious coconut and jello cup with a dollop of ice cream. Quick, friendly service. Can't wait to go back and try a full meal."}
{"text":"Went for dinner and had crispy pork adobo, volcano pork adobo and Filipino Crispers. The presentation was excellent utilizing bamboo plates lined with fresh banana leaves. The food was flavorful with a perfect temperature and spices. This was characteristic and authentic Filipino food at a very reasonable price.  Service wise the food was brought quickly upon completion as dishes were finished. The atmosphere leaves something to be desired but maybe after the owners get some traction and a following they can upgrade the space or move to a new one."}
{"text":"Newly opened sister restaurant from their 17th Ave SE location.  Really good traditional Filipino food. Highly recommend their locally baked fresh desserts. Great food, great prices.  This is a true hidden gem that is going to make a big name for themselves.  Highly recommend everyone try this place at least once."}
{"text":"A very unique and authentic Filipino cuisine experience that is buoyed by fast service and a friendly and helpful staff.   We went as a large group of 10 to try out the group meal (I forget what the Tagalog term is) which was served on AUTHENTIC banana leaves (as opposed to the fake printed stuff). The table came with crispy fried BBQ chicken, pork and fish. Plus, the rice is unlimited.   We also ordered a whole bunch of desserts like cassava and taro cakes. Unfortunately, I forget the name of the most. They were all phenomenal.   Service is extremely fast, friendly and the staff exceedingly polite. Would highly recommend this place before it gets \"discovered\" by John Gilchrist and hits mainstream audience. Also interesting to note that except our group, pretty much every other patron was Filipino. Which is always an excellent sign."}
{"text":"I went back and tried their adobo. After all the restaurant's name is Adobo Experience.  My husband had the Adobo Haven (adobo with coconut milk) and I had their Crispy Adobo (deep fried pork belly). What can I say about their crispy adobo? The meat wasn't dredged in oil, seasoned very well and fried to perfection! The dish wasn't overly sauced, which kept the crispy texture of the meat. I wish I could give a review of the adobo haven, but my husband finished off the dish. Which would indicate that the quite liked it.  Though I must admit that I was a bit sad at the end of our meal. Since they ran out of taho. If you've never had taho it is basically made up of soft/silken tofu, vanilla simple syrup (brown sugar, water and vanilla extract), and tapioca pearls. If you ever have the chance to go by Adobo Experience, try their taho. I think, they're the only Filipino restaurant in Calgary that serves it.  I may have left sad, but my tummy was quite happy with that crispy adobo.  Tip: If you ever feel like trying out their boodle fight (a feast good for 6-8 people) call ahead of time. We saw customers go in last night asking for a boodle fight. I heard it takes about 45 minutes to set up and most customers call in ahead of time for their boodle fight meal.    Boodle fight is a military style of eating where long tables are prepared and food are on top of the banana leaves. Viands and rice ready to eat using your bare hands, jugs of water are prepared on the side to wash hands before the \"eating combat\". With the signal to start the boodle fight, everyone aims for his/her position. -Urban Dictionary"}
{"text":"Love the krisssspy adobo!especially the krispy pata and flaming bulalo.adobo rice was on point!service can be really slow depends on what time ur going but its worth the wait."}
{"text":"Traveling with Filipino friends and was the closest Filipino restaurant in the area we were hanging out - found this gem.  Apparently, there are several locations, we just got there just before they close. So glad the host/sever welcomed us warmly. The restaurant had probably other 2 or 3 tables with people coming in for pick up. So we understood she was running back and fourth trying to pease everyone.  We ordered right away when she came to us, we had crispy pata, sinigang, lumpia, and adobo. Everything was pretty good. We enjoyed the food and the experience."}
{"text":"Read, set, boodle fight GO!  Got to experience a Boodle Fight along with some fellow Yelpers for the monthly Yelp International Supper Club. Can we have a mention for how many great places this supper club keeps introducing me to? And the food keeps getting better too!  What is a Booble Fight you may ask? Think a long line of rice laid out on banana leaves with all different types of meat laid out on top. You eat with your fingers (plastic gloves provided if needed). Unbelievably good food and a great experience.  One order of a Booble Fight comes with your choice of 3 meats, and as we had 2 orders we asked if we could try 6 different options. Adobo Experience graciously said yes and the feast commenced!  All of their meat is slow cooked, or slow braised, and then grilled, all covered with great marinade flavours. The bbq ribs were by far my favourite and just fell off the bone soft. Next up would have to be the crispy pata, which is pork hock, and was a delicious juicy mouthful. Tried 2 types of chicken, one marinaded and the other slow braised with more of a smoked flavour. A great ground pork and tofu dish was also served and even though the tofu was quite soft it was still very tasty and not mushy. Got to try milkfish, was grilled and was cut into smaller pieces. Lastly there was an eggplant + tomato + duck egg salad. Oh wait, we also had some seasonal veg tempura (carrots + yams + some other things I forgot) which came in a little patty and was a great crispy extra treat we added on.  Man on man that was a lot of food. All of us ate until we were close to popping and then took ourselves home some left overs.   At $100 for a boodle fight that feeds 6-8 people (with potential left overs depending on the extent of the feeding frenzy) this is some amazingly great value for money. So excited Adobo Experience was recommended to us for Yelp International Supper Club otherwise I would never have know of this amazing experience.  Very interested to go back and try more dishes from the menu as it all looked sooooo good... I was stalking tables on the way out and wanted to know what everyone was having :)"}
{"text":"Prices were decent and the service was excellent. We had ordered the crispy pata, crunchy adobo and sisig.   The crispy pata was okay, but the other two were a disappointment. I would come again but to try to other dishes."}
{"text":"They do really good boodle fights here. Is it shameful I didn't know that eating off a banana leaf with my bare hands was called boodle fights till now? Sue me, I know the national fruit,bird,anthem,vegetable, formal dress, and dish of my homeland so I have oodles and boodles of Filipino cred....bwiset  Anyways, they're very friendly and personable here. Become a regular and you've become family. They'll remember how you like certain dishes.  But the food is worth coming for. A growing list of Adobo dishes, supplemented by unique Filipino dishes. The dessert is outsourced but they're just as delicious. If there was one thing you had to try here I'd suggest the Chicken Adobo. No, I'd say the Crispy pata. Wait, the halo halo. Scratch that, they do a FLAMING bulalo. DANG I CANT MAKE MY MIND UP.  Overall I'm glad there's a new Filipino restaurant in town that's raising in Calgary's Filipino cuisine scene. A place I can drag newbies to rather than have to throw dinner parties and cook them Kare-Kare and Adobo."}
{"text":"Great new restaurant! Only 4 stars right now because I've only had a simple lunch. We had crispy pork adobo and kaldereta. Both were delicious. Service was friendly and food is very reasonably priced.  Will be back very soon."}
{"text":"Gutom na gutom kami naghahanap kami ng sabaw. Nag-order kami ng bulalo, sisig at kwek2. Sa tagal ng order namin akala ko masarap. Ang sabaw nila ang kapal ng oil na nakalutang at walang lasa parang leftover na dinagdagan nalang ng tubig. Mas masarap yong instant noodle bulalo flavor at least lasang bulalo. Hindi sya bulalo na ang laman nakakapit pa sa buto. Ang bulalo nila yong buto wala ng bone marrow sinaksakan nalang ng laman sa loob at nilagyan nalang ng beef chunks or cubes yung pangstew. Di ako natuwa obviously bakit ako magsasayang ng oras ko para sumulat ng review. But at least may lasa yung sisig kaya lang masyadong malambot parang pwede mong gamitan ng straw sa lambot. Poor me kain na lang kasi gutom at saka hindi naman ito first experience sa restaurant. Yong kwek2 ang nagiging desert namin kasi nahuli ng dating natraffic yata. Please lang ayosin nyo pinapakain nyo sa tao huwag na man yung tiratira kasi hindi naman mura yung pagkain ninyo."}
{"text":"This is my first Filipino restaurant food experience and very first boodle fight. I definitely recommend the boodle fight as a fun event to take a gang of family & friends too. The tables are covered with banana leaves and then, depending on the boodle you have chosen, rice is placed on the banana leaves and dishes are successively placed on top of the rice. Since this was a yelp event we got the double treatment, pork hock, beef ribs, tofu & ground pork, Filipino eggplant salad, yam tempura, lumpia, chicken adobo, grilled chicken, fried milk fish. (Pays to be a yelp elite member!!!) Overall the food was decent but the two things that stood out were the pork hock and the beef ribs. The other dishes lacked flavour and were uninteresting. The chicken adobo was okay as well. No utensils, you use your hand even for the rice. I was brought up in Southeast Asia so no surprise for me but the trick to eating the rice is grabbing some rice about the size of a small meat ball and and using your fingers to squish it together to a small lump and then putting it in your mouth. The Filipino drinks available were Calamansi (Filipino lime), coconut water and gulaman which was a sweet drink with grass jelly. I recommend the Calamansi as it's not too sweet and quite refreshing. I'd like to go back and try some other dishes outside of the boodle fight. It is a very small parking lot (6-8 cars max). Staff were very hospitable and friendly and happy to answer any questions."}
{"text":"Ditch the dishes the cutlery and dive into a wonderful Boodle Flight!  Accompanied by other adventurous Yelpers, I recently visited this Filipino restaurant for the first time to try their Boodle Fight meal.   With a Boodle Flight, traditional serving implements are eschewed in favour of giant banana leaves and a person's own fingers. Rice, various grilled meats and other accompaniments are spread out on a long table before letting diners loose to enjoy.   The grilled meats are all fantastic having been marinated and slow cooked. Highlights included sweet and smoky BBQ ribs, pig knuckle with delightfully crispy pork and fall-ff-the-bone lemongrass chicken.  There's no being shy with this type of meal, so I recommend coming with a good crowd of close friends and family!"}
{"text":"We went here last week. We were craving some Filipino food. The first thing I noticed inside was really nice it's like back home with bamboo, karendirya style. I liked it.   The service I would say 5/5 they were attentive and making sure we get what we wanted and always making sure we are okay.  The food I love the shrimp sinigang 5/5. I love that it's sour.  The tapsilog was good too very tasty. My gf oredered sisig it was bland tho missing a lot of flavor in it. Garlic rice was ok bland also. Then for dessert halohalo it was aight It's not authentic at all. And the top ice cream is vanilla and ube jam??? Ehh doesn't taste as good. I was hoping with ube ice cream and flan then more fruits in it but noooooo..  Because of the service I'll prolly go there again to try different kind of food."}
{"text":"Adobo Experience has a large variety of delicious comfort food at a great price. Some of our favourites are the volcano and haven adobo chicken, crispers, quail eggs, my idols fish, flaming steak and their garlic rice is the best! With the very friendly owners and staff adobo is a very welcoming place with great eats!"}
{"text":"My son and I have only seen boodle fights on YouTube and nothing beats the real thing!  It was truly an educational experience to see how the kitchen staff arranged the food on the banana leaf-lined table.  The servers are very friendly and helpful--we came with other Yelp International Supper Club members for a boodle fight and allowed the kitchen decide on what to prepare for our feast.  They certainly delivered and went hog wild (no pun intended); there was so much food on the table!  My top two favourites were the crispy pata (pork hock with crispy crackling and tender meat) and the barbecued pork ribs (the meat was soft and juicy and falling off the bone. The barbecue sauce was amazing--tangy, sweet and savoury...).  Actually, all the other meats (adobo manok(stewed chicken in soy-vinegar marinade), chicken inasal (grilled chicken in lemongrass, ginger, brown sugar and vinegar), tokwat baboy (pork and tofu), grilled bangus(milkfish) ) and the inihaw na talong (grilled eggplant with tomato wedges and salted duck eggs) were lip-smackingly delicious!   We will certainly be back (with hubby this time)!"}
{"text":"We wandered in here rather serendipitously, as good filipino restaurants are harder to find (there's not as many of them). I had a lemon drink, crispy pata, garlic rice and pancit (pronounced pan-seet) noodles.  The lemon drink had a slight but pleasant bitterness to it. The crispy pata (marinated deep fried pork hock) was to die for with a crispy exterior and amazingly moist tender and flavourful meat. It's fantastic and comes with bones and all. The vinegary sauce was a great complement to the meat. The pancit noodles had lots of veggies and the dish was topped with crispy pork bits. It was a garlicky umami flavour. I've tried making this at home and the noodles are pretty specific. Its a tapioca and rice based vermicelli noodle that's slightly chewy and translucent.   The food was delicious and apparently they have a 13 dollar dinner buffet which I have yet to try!  My only criticism is that the servers, although nice people, didn't bring us napkins or cutlery until we asked and I'm not sure if that was due to the buffet type setting, but I think anyone would expect the same."}
{"text":"This place just opened up new my workplace and my staff and I have now gone more than a few times. They have some yummy food if you like filipino food.  The spring rolls are amazing and the adobo is outstanding. When you go in they have a selection or roasted flavored peanuts and packs of fried pork fat.  Let me tell you that pork fat is so, so good.  I recommend this place to anyone looking to try a different type of flavorful food."}
{"text":"Adobo was not flavorful and overly salty. Pork was so dry and greasy that I couldn't even finish it (but the skin was crispy and done well)"}
{"text":"I will admit this is the first time I have ever eaten Filipino cuisine. The presentation and the service were top notch as mentioned in previous posts. The amount of food and the price are a great match, however, the meat in the dishes we ordered were very fatty and did not actually contain a lot of meat. The flavours in the dishes seemed to have been masked by the oily/fat from the meat or cooking oil. Happy munching!  Ordered 1. Volcano adobo w/ chicken and mixed 2. Sisig (great flavours but on the salty side)  3. Flaming bulalo steak (really cool presentation and potential fire hazard but great!) - a little fatty"}
{"text":"The chicken was dry (as was the rice). Seemed like it had just been warmed up and might have been past it's prime. The food was not seasoned well at all. Want to try the other locations as I was so excited to see this restaurant open- we need more good Filipino food restaurants in yyc. That being said, I will keep looking elsewhere."}
{"text":"I love this place! Will definitely come back for more. Next time I won't order oily foods all at the same time."}
