{"text":"My friend and I went on a quest for some cheap but still good mexican food. We spent 12 dollars between the two of us and did not get what we paid for. First, we actually had to run to Circle K to get cash since they don't accept cards. Then when we finally got our food and got home, we were underwhelmed. The taco was equivalent to Jack in the Box, the rice was no good and the burrito was just bland. So skip this taco stand and go to one of the 500+ mexican food places in downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"This is my Saturday morning spot! I have not had anything but great and personable service here, and the food is uniquely good! This establishment is cash only, so come prepared. Also, being located in Sunnyslope, outside seating will add a lot of interest to any meal. DON'T FEED THE WILDLIFE! LOL.

Try any of his breakfast burritos with green sauce and be prepared to come back for more  
:-)"}
{"text":"CASH ONLY.. I drove to Circle K and got cash out. 

Alfredo's Deli is not a deli... it is a road side burrito house with a walk up window and tables outside to sit on. 

Alfredos has been around since the 70's and the the current owner has been there since 1990. He bought it from the Orig owners when they retired. He is very friendly and personable. 

They make mainly Mexican food with some American food mixed in. 

I had a Green Chili burrito and chips with salsa. The burrito was plenty big but not overly huge. The chips were fresh and thick. Although I enjoyed the meal there was nothing to bring me back. I wish it did."}
{"text":"Great little spot for breakfast lunch or early dinner. They close at 6:30 PM. There is a patio you can eat on the outside. Not in the greatest neighborhood but still nice.The food taste homemade and the prices are reasonable"}
{"text":"I love this place. If you want the best breakfast burrito known to mankind than please stop here and try the green chili sauce burrito with egg and bacon. It's on the menu, you can't miss it.  I go here at the very least 3 times a month, so good!"}
