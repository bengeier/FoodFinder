{"text":"Zach was the absolute best and he made me the best dish of ice cream ever at cold stone creamery. I'd like him to be working next time I come in. He makes one mean dish of ice cream. Seriously I wish the other employees wouldn't be so skimpy on the toppings."}
{"text":"The ice cream is excellent but a little pricey.  The service is less than stellar.  Our daughter bought a cone and discovered a hair in it.  When we returned to the counter and informed the employee that sold us the cone she actually said \"We've been getting that a lot lately\".  Great!

Also, if you order anything to be picked up later, like a birthday cake or cupcakes, make sure you call before you go to pick it up as they seem to be less than organized with their orders.

I gave them a 2 star rating based on the excellent flavors... it should have been at least a 4.5 with some attention to customer service."}
{"text":"This place has the creamiest, most flavorful, but also the unhealthiest ice cream creations ever. If you aren't worried about consuming 1000 calories in one bowl of ice cream, then come here. 
I like watching them create the concoctions, but I try not to come here often."}
{"text":"Waiting in line to get ice cream which is delicious. Two people ahead of me and only one worker. Place is pretty messy but hey it's ice cream. Can't stand when a worker uses their hand to wipe anything that spills over the cup. Ick! The last straw was when the worker handled money and change and then waited on the person in front of me without washing their hands. Put on gloves or something if you're not going to wash your hands. Definitely need a cashier and someone preparing ice cream separately. I walked off empty handed because it's just unsanitary at this location."}
{"text":"Agreed with Dave's review about the staff and service being a hit or miss. I normally don't make stops anymore to cold stone restaurants because their ice cream is so expensive. Plus, I don't care for the taste of their ice cream. Maybe it is just me, but I think it's overrated."}
{"text":"I typically like Coldstone, but the service was not friendly and the Ice Cream didn't seam to be as creamy as it normally is."}
{"text":"Pretty darn expensive for custard but it is really good, possibly the best I have ever had.  Been there over 15 times and have yet to see an adult working in the place.  Service is hit and miss.  Our last trip the IQ level of the help was very low.  Bathrooms are usually clean."}
{"text":"Ordered a Brownie a la Coldstone and was super impressed with the customization that coldstone allowed. I mixed two flavors of ice cream and replace the pecans with almonds. The staff is very friendly too."}
{"text":"Awesome staff. Clean tables. Generous helpings. I always love coldstone. I made my own concoction, sweet cream ice cream with marshmallows gummy bears and gram cracker pie crust. I call it gummy pie. Think about the size you get though, their ice cream is rich."}
{"text":"I don't recommend going there.  My wife and I decided to go there for some dessert after a very nice dinner.  I wanted an \"Apple Pie A la Cold Stone\".  I have had this before and it is normally very good.  I was told that they had been out of the pie filling for a while.  Yet this is one of their \"Signature Creations\".  I would expect that if this is something that they always have that they would have on their menu, they would have the ingredients for it.  Then, My wife ordered their seasonal \"Funnel Cake Sundae.  My wife ended up waiting 15 minutes for this.  Jacob and Chad told us that they had to reheat the Funnel cake for the sundae twice.  This made is rock hard and she had to throw most of the funnel cake away because she could not eat it.  As we were waiting, I noticed how dirty the entire interior was.  It looks like the floors and base boards have not cleaning in months.  Tables and floors were dirty and sticky-GROSS.  I did not check the bathrooms, too scared to try.  On top of all this, the price for their \"Creations\" is way too high!!!  I am tempted to call the health department for an inspection.  DON\"T GO THERE!!!  it is a waste of time and money."}
{"text":"Showed up at 9pm ish, only 2 employees working (both looked pretty young like high school age). The one who helped me was very friendly and didn't seem stressed out by the line (about a constant 5-7 people). Would go again."}
{"text":"This location was great! Service was fast, flavors were stupendous, everything looked clean. As I walked in I was greeted with a warm hello and was surprised by their large variety of ice creams and toppings to choose from. It took awhile to decide my order but the staff politely waited and answered all my questions. I think it makes a big difference what time and which staff member you receive but the people that were working while I went in were very friendly. My personal favorite is the mint mint chocolate chocolate chip replacing the chocolate chips with Oreos."}
{"text":"I LOVE going to coldstone!! All of there ice cream is made fresh in house daily! Plenty of flavors and toppings to choice from to create your own masterpiece or select a signature flavor! I Love \"Birthday Cake Remix\" and \"Peanut Butter Perfection. \" A like it size is just the right amount but for about 50 cents more you can upgrade your treat to a love it. 
They also have fresh smoothies and milkshakes. Ice cream to go in half gallon or pint sized as well as Birthday Cakes!! Beautiful fresh birthday cakes!! Yumm!! 

I can't see a movie with out my coldstone!!"}
{"text":"No one at counter when I arrived.   The young man that came up to the counter to serve me was nice though.   If he was really nice he should have told me the ice cream was not set well today.   He didn't.   
I ordered two waffle cones with two different kinds of ice cream.  One was apple pie and the other was cheesecake.  it was basically soup before they put it into the cone.   My wife immediately asked what it was when I brought it to the car.   It looks terrible doesn't it?  I said.    We drank what we had and tossed the rest.   What joke."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has such horrible reviews. It's not bad. Services is decent and the ice cream tastes good although it's a little over priced. Not sure id stop here very often I do prefer orange leaf to here."}
{"text":"Huge disappointment from when this place first opened. Ice cream tasted like mushed and melted ice cream that had been sitting out and the topping that I added was so little it was ridiculous. I had to dig to find the pecans that I added as my topping. The ice cream maker also seemed very nice at first but then seemed very irritated when I asked to try another flavor. 

Would I come here again? Probably not at this location..."}
{"text":"I had been deciding to visit a Coldstone in town and thought it would be convenient after stopping at Walmart across the road.  I had hoped the Coldstone was outside of the mall but it wasn't.  I walked all the way from Neighborhood 4 to Neighborhood 1.  Once the movie theater popcorn smelt overly delicious, I almost opted for it since Coldstone didn't seem to be in sight.  Then that familiar sweet scent mixed in an there finally beheld Coldstone with a couple of people in line.  I already knew I wanted the Founder's Favorite but I wanted to be sure enough brownie pieces were in it.  I ended up in my mind decided from Love it to Gotta Have It.  Then I figured, WTHeck just get Mine so I told the salesgirl.  She wasn't sure which size it was in cups at the back.  The person that was already in back said the Founder's Favorite in Mine were already ready to be sold in the freezer.  I was already iffy as I had wanted it freshly made so I could eat some then and save some for later.  I gave in and didn't want to fuss as the line grew once I was served.  I ended up with a $9 cup of ice cream with majority Sweet cream, pecans, and ice chips in the way.  I could compare this cup to something in walmart versus that WOW taste I usually get from my favorite signature Coldstone.  I probably won't return here and try the Mallard Creek location."}
{"text":"The woman in front of me got a cup of ice cream with a hair in it. I asked 3 times for just a cup of ice cream but got a cone in the cup and got charged for it. I love mint chocolate chip but didn't care for the signature mint mint chocolate chocolate chip. Not minty. Tastes like a chocolate brownie and $6 for a cup of ice cream is stupid"}
{"text":"Time has not been kind to this Cold Stone Creamery location.  For a while, it was the next great thing - there always were long lines of families anxious to get their butterfat and sugar fix.  The buzz has faded and now those same families flock to the local froyo joints to get their frozen dairy fix.  I stopped by this weekend while shopping at Greenway Station and found the store devoid of patrons.  I know it's been a long, cold winter, but we Wisconsinites love our ice cream and Babcock Hall was standing room only when I visited later that same day.

So why does my ice-creaming loving family now generally eschew Cold Stone?
* Texture - I really prefer a firm scoop of ice cream and that's not what you get at Cold Stone.  The texture is far too gooey for my liking.  It's not terrible, but I much prefer the denser texture of the product at Babcock Dairy or The Chocolate Shoppe any day of the week and twice on Sunday.  The other textural problem is that Cold Stone ice cream melts too fast, so bring a gross of handi-wipes when bringing the kiddos here. 
 
* Flavor - The ice cream here is too sweet.  At Cold Stone, it is all about excess, whether it be about the butterfat content, the sugar content or the oversaturated flavorings.  Again, it's not terrible, but it's just not my cup of tea.

* Serving Size - The theme of excess carries over to the over-the-top serving sizes.  While I am not a huge fan of froyo, at least I can control my serving size when I visit the near-by Menchies or Orange Leaf.  In addition, while I'm on the topic of serving sizes, can I just add that I detest the cutesy \"Like It\", \"Love It\" and \"Gotta Have It\" serving size names.

* Service - When the place first opened, the staff was energetic and responsive.  I admit it was hokey, but I kinda liked the dorky songs they sang when you left a tip.  But now, a trip to Cold Stone is more like visiting a gulag.  Leaving a tip rarely triggers a response, much less a chorus of \"Ice cream, baby\" sung to the tune of Ice, Ice Baby.  My other pet peeve is that the tables always seem to be sticky, thanks to the soupiness of the ice cream.  It's really kind of a depressing place to visit now.

* Pro tip: If you have a peanut allergy, have them clean the stone before they mix your ice cream or you risk cross contaminating your treat.  (I learned that the hard way.)"}
{"text":"Came to this place it closes at 9:00 pm and shop owner closed the shop totally fine. Instead of saying politely that we are closed and you have to leave the owner is saying we have to kick you out. Never coming back here if you want to get insulted just because the store is closing."}
{"text":"They earn ZERO star. Tried to rip us off with JUST ONE piece of candy into the ice cream. We said excuse me? They said yes just one. We said no we have a lot to add in Florida. They laughed. We stood there staring so they finally added more. Before we ordered, we noticed few ice cream flavors color didn't look right. Ours looked kinda fine. We tasted it after buying. It didn't taste right. We immediately discarded it. Wasted $20 for 4 of us..... ugh! Dont go there! Dont bother! Now that explains why so many Cold Stones are closing everywhere. Good riddance! You guys need to go!"}
{"text":"Horrible employees. They do not close until 9pm on Sunday's and there was a sign that said they closed today at 6pm(Ok thats fine)I was in line by 5:50 and they kept complaining to the other employees saying \"omg we close in 10 min\" or \"I want to go home.\" As I'm waiting patiently they close the gates and tell me to leave?? Very unprofessional if you ask me. They continued to laugh about the people they ran off.. And they weren't even polite about it. I will not be back because of this. I called Cc mills location right after that to speak with a manager and I was told the manager wasn't there...it all makes sense now. Find different employees or you will definitely lose business."}
{"text":"Honestly, Cold Stone has the best ice cream I've ever had.  Maybe I don't get out much, but this stuff is fantastic.  

This particular location always comes through - it's clean, the staff are friendly, and they are very accommodating (throwing some take-home concoctions in the freezer while we eat our current order in the store).

We never get Cold Stone without a coupon, however.  Yes, it's fantastic, but expensive.  Various coupon books (Entertainment Book, maybe the Bucky Book?) will provide BOGO coupons, or buy one, get one $.99.  That helps.

Favorites include:
Me:  \"Strawberry Shortcake\" (made with cake batter ice cream)
Wife/kid:  cake batter ice cream with brownie in it
kid:  well, anything chocolate, but he loved the banana ice cream too.

The flavors are spot-on.  Sample a few when you go in (even if you know what you're getting already!)."}
{"text":"My husband and I love cold stone. However we will not be returning to this location. Tonight (11-30-16) we came to the location inside concord mills before a movie, we made our order and received our cups and waited while our card was being processed- the machine was having problems connecting to a host and the transaction wouldn't go through. We tried 5-8 times with no success. The manager was called by the two girls working who were as polite as possible, and the girl on the phone turned to us and asked us to go get cash out of an ATM which would have cost us 5.50 in fees and we would miss the movie we already paid for. She asked to speak to my husband over phone and proceeded to tell us we \"have\" to go get cash from an ATM so we could pay, he said he would if they'd cover the ATM fees \"it doesn't work that way sir\" I explained that I would be in the next day making an order for my husbands birthday cake and I could pay them then if that was an option (I can't live with the idea of \"stealing\" I'm an honest person) and she rudely explained \"places don't just have tabs you can run up\" 

Well lady businesses usually have functioning machinery and don't try and force their customers to go to an ATM and make them feel like they did something wrong. 

We gave our cups back and left. 
The manager cost themselves our future business."}
{"text":"This Coldstone delivers delicious ice cream, just like any other. The staff wasn't particularly friendly or talkative, although it is a bit later in the night. They really underdid it on my toppings compared to other locations."}
{"text":"So sad \"The Pie Who Loved Me\" is no longer a Cold Stone Classic...it is my absolute favorite and will have to knock down their rating a star for killing their best flavor. Very pleased the CSR must have been on staff for a while because he knew how to make it. 

Otherwise, Cold Stone Creamery is awesome! There is usually always someone inside looking for a cold cream treat...for reference, it is 11 degrees and there are about a dozen people getting ice cream less than 30 minutes before close."}
{"text":"Overall:
Consistent with other Cold Stones with above average ice cream. They usually crush/fold the toppings into the ice cream but they didn't for the child-size cup that I ordered. My sister got a \"like it\" which is the small with 2 toppings and a waffle cone. Our total was just under $9. 

Vegetarian:
Obviously everything is vegetarian but I did not see any vegan options."}
