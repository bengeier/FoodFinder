{"text":"Uniburger is a good Montréal burger joint, well deserving its 4 stars. The bulk of those stars, however, come from the abundant and delicious fries rather than the burger itself.  The burger was good, I am not denying this, HOWEVER, since moving to New York I've had my share of good burgers. Theirs was reminiscent of a lesser Shake Shack burger: it had the same feel, the same basic taste for all basic ingredients (beef patty, tomatoes, lettuce...) but it lacked the delicious Shack sauce which brings it all together and elevates the whole burger.  Still, the whole was very enjoyable - I would definitively recommend it as a spot when rolling through town."}
{"text":"Plain burgers with no frills. Cheap but you get what you pay for. White flour bun, iceberg lettuce. No fancy toppings or table service. Paper cups and plates. NOT a date place. My girlfriend was NOT IMPRESSED and neither was I."}
{"text":"There's no gimmicks or catches, chicken burgers or combos and trios; Uniburger is a straight up classic burger joint where you' go to scarf down solid burgers and wash them down with bottomless cups from a free flowing soda machine (that in even includes ginger ale and fanta.) You'd think that Uniburger is trying to fill the shoes of La Paryse; completely the opposite. Despite the location, Uniburger is walking to the beat of their own drummer and grilling to the heat of their own griddle. It's comparable and is probably Montreal's version of a Shake Shack or In-n-Out burger - our own fast food burger."}
{"text":"The highlight of my burger was its low price point. Otherwise, the burger was not extraordinary. It was a little worrisome that the cashier who handled my money was the same person who grilled my patty and assembled my burger - without washing his hands in between and while juggling a phone call."}
{"text":"The time I went there it's smelt like a dead body.  The burgers are decent but everything else isn't good."}
{"text":"Très bons burgers de cantine.  Les boulettes étaient bien cuites mais juteuses!  Le local mériterait un peu d'amour par contre."}
{"text":"Great product, but poorly organized.  I love uniburger burgers, and more often than not, I've actually been able to buy them when I go there. The last time, however, I showed up at 7:10 on a Sunday evening (50 minutes before closing time) and was turned away because they apparently had so many takeout orders to do that they would not take any new orders. In my experience working in and patronizing restaurants, the general rule has always been that the kitchen keeps taking orders until they're officially closed. Busy nights suck, but the restaurant has set hours for a reason, and if I don't know whether or not I'll be able to order food when I walk in, then why should I go at all?  Like I said, the food is great, but whoever owns uniburger should give a little more thought to how their restaurant is going to work. If they can't fulfill orders an hour before closing, then they should change their \"open\" hours or figure out a better system than sending customers away to eat a lousy slice of pizza."}
{"text":"Love uniburger- reminds me of in and out burger back in California.   The service here is pretty quick and we often get take out for them when we are craving a good burger and crispy fries.  They often run out of grilled onions, but otherwise - yum!"}
{"text":"My favourite burger now on Côte des Neiges. Same delicious no-frills burger and fries."}
{"text":"Best fast food hamburger ever made. No contest.  Fries are crispy and delicious.  Milkshakes are awesome"}
{"text":"Probably the best burger in Montreal. If you are comparing this to In-N-Out or Shake Shack or something else you have in 'Muurica, no, it is not the same, and yes, you will be disappointed.   This is the best that we have in this fine city and it is mighty fine. Excellent burger. Like, very very tasty, perfectly cooked to order and fresh.   The fries are OK, that's the only downfall, they could do with a fry upgrade but seriously, who cares?  Burger on fleek."}
{"text":"Ordered a double Uniburger - basically a double cheese burger with lettuce, tomato, and Uniburger sauce (basically, a big mac sauce variant). Very tasty, pretty greasy, but all good. Meat was soft and nicely seared, and had that 'melt in the mouth' quality. Fries were decent - different to the usual hand cut, thinner and quite crisp. I think I should have added bacon, but that's really an obvious statement as bacon improves everything. All in all a \"go out and get it now\" - as Ken Domik would say ;)"}
{"text":"I'll keep this short and sweet.  It's very much like a Five Guys burger, but slightly better. Great burger, but overly salty fries. Don't bother with the Uniburger sauce...it kind of overpowers the meat and just tastes like a lesser BigMac sauce."}
{"text":"Yesterday I paid a visit to uniburger and was pleasantly surprised! I had a double cheese burger with almost all the toppings they had and added a soda and fries!   The burger was great and filling and the fries were very good and not drenched in salt like most burgers joints in the city.   Value for money you get a great meal! My only suggestions is to add topping like avocados and red onions etc.   Service was friendly and great."}
{"text":"I called to place an order so I can pick it up. The owner was extreeeeeeemly rude and did not care about my request.  He said; \"WE DONT DO PICK UPs, and we don't do phone ORDERS by phone.\" He added; TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT, it's MY RESTAURANT, it's MY POLICY!!!! I was shocked!!! What f**** burger joint doesn't allow food pick up!!! You should be thankful to any client that calls you to place an order!!!! Instead of telling us off you should tailor yourself to our requests!"}

{"text":"Ive been to many burger joints all over town. I've been to burger joints all across North America...and UniBurger is as good as the best I've been to. It reminds me of IN and OUT burger in the USA.  Love the uniburger sauce.  Thank g-d they opened up another location close to me on CDN....cause I used to travel to Ontario E just to get a double cheese trio + an extra double cheeseburger..."}
{"text":"Looking for a REALLY tasty but greasy (yes!) cheeseburger on a soft potato roll? Uniburger makes em.  I wanted to grab something, anything, quick, and Uniburger was closest on my Yelp search.  Very understated, utilitarian decor, but at the same time a very warm and cozy place to treat yourself to some comfort food. Go!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure how this compares to In-N-Out burgers but I think this is as good as montreal burgers get.     Simple, greasy and so delicious. I had the double cheeseburger trio which came with fries and a drink for around $10. I can't comment on the service was since i ordered delivery, but for the price, the quality was the burger was unbeatable. The patties tasted of real beef, the cheese was perfectly melted and the condiments are simple and fresh. All perfectly assembled between two toasted buns, it is the quintessential no fuss burger.    I would recommend this place to anyone and am definitely going back for the cheesy fries soon."}
{"text":"I love the uniburger, it's resemblance to both icons such as shake shack and in and out, and of course the secret uni sauce.  However I was taken back when I asked for my bun grilled (a request that I've had in the past.  I was told a firm no, and when I asked politely again for this simple request I was told 'that wasn't how the burger is suppose to be'.  As a loyal customer I found this very disappointing, so much so that I've been compelled to write this review."}
{"text":"We waited 10mins before we ordered because there was only one staff there who did cooking and worked as cashier at the same time, he was busy in making others orders.  I chose a single cheese burger in combo, when I took the first bite of it, it was just warm, definitely not hot enough for me, which made me a bit disappointed. However, I liked the patty which was juicy, thick and soft. I love cheese and I assumed that the cheeseburger should have be filled with melted cheese, but it did not. It just looked like the same as the uniburger. Another disappointment.  The fries were average. The staff made them really crispy, but lack some salt. Overall, it's a fast food restaurant that I may try a second time as I like their beef, but next time I will ask them to make it hot."}
{"text":"The hamburger was fresh and so were the toppings. The restaurant was clean (and small). The burger price was reasonable, not so the fries $2.99 and the drink $1.99 (free refills, though.) Now, the fries were very well cooked and tasty... the drink, it's Coke, really nothing special.   Their setup reminds me of In&Out but without the animal style."}
{"text":"Yum!  After reading that this is Montreal's answer to In-N-Out, I had to give it a shot. I had the Uniburger and fries and it totally hit the spot. It's nothing fancy, but it's satisfying and the special sauce did conjure up memories of In-N-Out.  The staff are mostly unenthusiastic youths who would obviously rather be doing anything else, but they were friendly enough and at least they got my food out in a timely manner."}
{"text":"As a native of california (lover of in n out!) and current resident of NYC, Uniburger straddles an interesting line between the two burger franchises. Overall, the price seemed a bit expensive per burger but otherwise a solid meal!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular at uniburger. I love their burgers!  It's small and the decoration is very simple but the burgers are SO flavorful! Totally recommended!"}
{"text":"C'est vrai que la première fois, je l'ai trouvé un peu trop simple ton burger. Genre, ça fait l'affaire... sans plus.  Puis finalement, parmi la variété des places qui proposent des burgers en tout genre à Montréal, j'en viens à aimer ta simplicité. Je ne passe pas 15mins devant ta carte à me décider. Tout se fait rapidement, du service à la dégustation. Car disons-le, il est bon ton burger, même fameux. Alors il ne reste pas longtemps dans mon plateau, ni même tes frites."}
{"text":"Now that's a tasty burger. Ordered a simple uniburger and thoroughly enjoyed it. Sauce is really really good, can't quite put my finger on what's in it."}
{"text":"Really top notch burger.  I was at a bar next door boozing on craft cocktails and needed to get a base down- otherwise I was going to be wasted.  Uniburger was the perfect answer. A quick and tasty hamburger that was reasonably priced. Service was prompt, restaurant was generally clean. I did not have to wait long at all."}
{"text":"Uniburger is one of my favourite burgers in Montreal. The burgers are extremely tasty and can be compared to burgers you would find in California at In and Out burger. I would recommend this gem to anyone who is a burger lover.  Get the special sauce.. you will love it.   My only complaint is that it is a tad too pricey for a trio in my opinion."}
{"text":"Best burger in Montreal. And apparently no one seems to know it, because once again we're the only ones here. Fine by me! You go ahead and eat those mediocre A&W or NBG burgers, I'm gonna be chillin here, enjoying the short wait time, smackin on these simple yet amazing burgers! And fries! Then go next door to Diperie for some ice cream! Nomnomnomnom"}
{"text":"I was looking for a simple burger joint, a high quality casse-croute or cantine.  Read some quick reviews and off I went.  People are raving about the burgers, and I can see why. It's un-extravagant, clean by design and the meat is very juicy.  The downside is that it's a bit too small for me, 4oz before cooking. I should have ordered the double or skipped the fries and taken 2 single burgers.  The fries were the biggest letdown, not golden crispy like in photos, but limp and brown. I got all the leftover burnt bits as well. Maybe better on a fresh batch, but this is what i got.  The cashier should ask what we want in the burger, it's only when i took a postcard of their menu when leaving that I see we could customize it with various toppings like fried onions and hot peppers.  This is a very bare-bones restaurant, no frills, pick up and go kind of place. I like the location and this could really work. The prices are super cheap $4 for single burgers and $6 for double, add 50¢ for cheese or Uni Sauce.  Some have commented about how great it is that it doesn't offer a huge menu, I disagree. I think adding some steamy's, a poutine or just some bacon to the burger would be a step in the right direction."}
{"text":"Possibly one of the best burgers and fries in the city. The Uniburger sauce is heavenly.   However, quality is very inconsistent, and they are somehow always understaffed. Just walked in here and was informed that the order will take 45 min !!!   It is quite busy but there are only 2 employees. In the past 5 min I've been sitting here they have already lost a couple of customers because of the wait."}
{"text":"Went here for Poutine week. I found there were too many fries for the amount if sauce/cheese.  I wanted to try their burger too and that, on the other hand, was great. Their special sauce was delicious.   I'd  go back here if looking for fast food in the area."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! The fries were perfectly salty and crispy. The burger was amazing. I wanted more pickles but I only got a few so that was unfortunate but the serving staff was friendly enough. All around a good burger place but more pickles would have been nice! Also the price was a little high in my opinion"}
{"text":"The first time I went to Uniburger I had a pleasent experience and the burger was very tasty.  Would have given 4 stars if it had not been for the second visit.   We were greeted with someone who clearly would have rather been doing anything else as it felt like we were an inconvenience for him to be in the restaurant.  It must have been because the restaurant was closing in 30 minutes but still, it wasn't closed.  The cook was also on his phone in plain sight and I am not sure if he washed his hands before cooking the burgers. Play with ur phone out of sight if you must.  A few more people entered after us and the clerk looked like his night was now ruined and really didn't make us feel welcome.  The food is great but the service is a gamble depending on day and time of your visit.  Not sure if I will go again as there are good burgers with more consistent service close by."}
{"text":"They make a mean burger. Very fresh meat, nice toppings and a delicious sauce. Fries are awesome, probably some of the best fries I've had in Montreal. This place is legit. Keep up the good work guys."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I consider ourselves sort of Hamburger connoisseurs. We know what we like and we know when it's good. We had heard a lot of good things about uniburger but never had the time to try it out.  We finally got to try it on a rainy Wednesday afternoon.    Upon entering, it looks ok. Nothing really stands out and it is a bit small but otherwise fine. The guy who took our order was nice and the service was fast.  The burgers look amazing and they taste amazing too. The bacon, which is cooked to perfection made the entire burger. The uniburger sauce is also super tasty. The only downside was the bread, It tasted a bit like pastry bread. It just didn't really fit in with the rest of the burger.   It's definitely on my top list of burger places."}
{"text":"No signs, no glitz, just burgers, shakes and fries. Can't be beat for $11, but the shakes are +$5. I would almost dare to say that it is as good as Shake Shack or In-N-Out, especially if you can't fly to California, or want to drive to New York for a Burger. Try it! Now!!!!!"}
{"text":"Uniburger is an In-n-Out knockoff - from the color scheme and menu, to the way the food is served.  As for the burger it self, it too is a copy of In-n-Out. It does come quite close, I have to say. You can add more things to your burger than at In-n-Out and to my knowledge, there is no 'secret menu' like how there is in the US counterpart.  The patty that I ate was fresh and their special sauce is very similar to In-n-Out's sauce.  As for the fries, they are different than the In-n-Out fries, but not in a bad way. The ones I had were freshly made so were warm and crispy. They would be perfect with a side of mayo. However, true to In-n-Out, there were only very small paper ketchup holders and a ketchup pump.  As for the greasy-factor - my fries were a little greasier than In-n-Out fries - maybe just this fresh batch. The burger was medium greasy - just greasy enough for it to be good (not too dry, not too wet).  When you go to Uniburger, you order first, take your receipt, and wait for your order to come out, just like at In-n-Out. Then it arrives in a metal tray - burger half wrapped in paper, and fries in a little paper basket. Similar in presentation to In-n-Out, but in In-n-Out there is a red plastic tray/holder.  You can leave with your take out, or sit down in the fast food-y booths/tables to enjoy it warm and fresh. I recommend that. You'll eat it quickly and want to have another one. Maybe just order 2 burgers to save yourself an additional wait.   They have milkshakes too. I did not have one, so cannot comment. Likely I'll try one in the future.  So yes - Uniburger comes close to In-n-Out, but is not quite the same. It's like a really good imitation Louis Vuitton bag - you notice the differences if you are a fashionista and/or look closely. Function wise - a good looking bag is a good looking bag - just like a good burger & fries is a good burger & fries. Yes, I'll be coming back. Yes, I like it a lot."}
{"text":"Burgers très bon , ils se casse un peu la geul il faut les manger vite mais vraiment bon , les frites sont vraiment top !   Point négatif  Le gars à la caisse est pas super aimable."}
{"text":"Great burger! Was skeptical a couple of times, but decided to take control of my doubtful nature and go for it.   While it took a seemingly long time to prepare the order, the Uniburger was a delight. Diner-quality without being too greasy or heavy.   Also, the fries were really, really good.  And apparently, they deliver for free if youre willing to pay cash (I went to pick it up).  Will definitely go back for more, as should y'all."}
{"text":"Après avoir testé celui de Rue Ontario Est, je me suis rendu à celui de Côte-des-Neiges. Et pas de doutes, Uniburger confirme sa bonne réputation !  Rien à ajouter si ce n'est que c'est toujours délicieux, avec un service rapide et des ingrédients de qualité (pour voir mon avis : http://bit.ly/1sokZ16)  Seul point faible : le restaurant est vraiment petit. Je vous conseille d'y aller avant les heures de pointe, ou de prendre à emporter. Ce serait le mieux !"}
{"text":"Uniburger, ou le fast-food associant modestie et qualité.   C'est sur la rue Ontario, après un pré-drink à l'Abreuvoir, que j'ai aperçu ce petit fast-food, dont on m'avait parlé de lui pour son excellente réputation.  En entrant, la décoration est assez sobre : rien de dépaysant et modeste à la fois, ce que j'apprécie bizarrement. Mais concentrons nous sur le menu !  Le menu est très simple : vous avez deux ou trois choix de burger (l'uniburger, le cheeseburger et peut être un troisième, je ne saurai m'en souvenir), des frites, et une boisson. À noter que vous avez aussi des milkshakes ! Il est possible de prendre un extra fromage pour ton burger.  Pour un menu trio, cela m'a coûté dans les 10-11$ avec taxes, ce qui est convenable ! En à peine 5 minutes d'attente, le service avait déjà fini. Niveau rapidité, je dis well done :)  Ok, passons directement dans le coeur du sujet. - Le pain a la texture des autres fast-food (dont je ne citerai pas les noms ahah), mais quand on croque dans son burger, on sent vraiment qu'il est moelleux, limite fondant. Et j'adore ! C'est l'extase assurée !  - Un poil déçu pour la viande, qui était un peu trop cuite à mon goût (j'aime quand c'est bien saignant, tu vois ce que je veux dire :) ).   - Et on n'oublie pas la feuille de salade et la tranche de tomate qui font toute la différence ! Really nice.  - Je ne saurai te dire de quoi est composée la sauce Uniburger, mais elle avait l'air délicieuse en tout cas. Ça dégoulinait un peu, mais ce n'était pas grave dans le fond.  - Pour ce qui est des frites, c'est juste parfait. Croustillantes, en grande quantité, je n'ai pas boudé mon plaisir !   En fait, Uniburger vient casser le cliché du fast-food un peu sale, et prouve que l'on peut très bien manger avec une qualité indéniable, pour un prix tout à fait correct !   Je vous conseille de manger sur place. J'avais pris à emporter, et habitant à moins d'1 mile d'Uniburger, mon plat était un peu froid en cours de route (la neige et le vent peuvent aussi expliquer ça)."}
{"text":"Recommended by a friend. The uniburger is juicy but the size of the burger is pretty small.  My friend highly recommended their fries but I didn't find anything special in it.   A combo cost about 10$ which is reasonable for a trio."}
{"text":"The greatest thing about this place is that it doesn't try to be what it's not. I got very sick of gourmet burger places popping up all over the city. Foie gras doesn't belong on a burger. The art of making a good fast-food hamburger that is delicious, flavourful, hits the spot and is at the right price point is not easily mastered. Uniburger has done it! Try their Uniburger special (at 5$ for a single, it's really a good deal). The atmosphere is homey without feeling cheap . A great addition to Ontario!"}
{"text":"Je l'avoue, j'ai eu tord.   Tord de croire que ce restaurant ne méritait pas de se faire connaître, tord de dire que ses burgers étaient trop simple. Lors de ma première visite, l'établissement n'avait que quelques jours à son actif et je n'avais tout simplement pas capté sa vocation. Non, on n'y sert pas des burgers de cerfs ou aux galettes de légumineuses, non y'a pas d'extra fromage brie/bleu/chèvre ou de sauce chipotle fumée avec des p'tits bonbons qui font \"pop\" dedans parce que \"oh-que-ça-serait-original-personne-y-a-jamais-pensé-let's-go\". Ici, on réinvente pas la recette, mais on la cuisine à la perfection.  Le pain est moelleux, la boulette juteuse, les condiments frais, une sauce à mourir. Tu peux prendre un extra fromage orange mais sérieusement, t'en a pas besoin. Juste le burger tout court et tu vas comprendre c'est quoi pour vrai, un vrai bon burger sans flafla."}
{"text":"I consider myself a burger addict. I could eat burgers all day everyday. On this particular day I had a burger for lunch and then we went to Uniburger for dinner.  I heard about this place through instagram of all places! The food porn pictures really made an impression on me and when my boyfriend and I decided to go to Montreal for the day this was the only place that I knew I wanted to visit.  When you walk in the place looks unexciting. You order at the cash then wait for your number to be called. We ordered a uniburger which has their special sauce on it and we got fries and a Pepsi.   So how was the burger? It met my high expectations.  I loved it!! It's been a week now and we are still talking about that delicious burger we had in Montreal.  The fries are thin cut and crispy and I really liked them but the true star of the meal was the burger. Definitely going back for more uniburgers.   -Jughead Jones reincarnate"}
{"text":"Great tasting burger, reminds me of shake shack. Patty texture was good, and the burger toppings were well balanced. I can eat them all day, TBH. However, it was a pretty small for the price we paid. We went pretty late, so the fries seemed like they were bottom of the batch, chewy and small. The food was delicious no doubt, but the value was not worth it. Atmosphere was simple, diner style, small little place. For fast food, service wasn't fast either (cause we were in a rush for a game tournament)"}
{"text":"Amazing old fashion burger w crazy taste. Fries are good too. They basically cut out all of the bullcrap that goes into making a burger joint fancy and just kill it in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Great burger place! Located on Cote-des-Neiges near UdeM/HEC campuses, it offers a somewhat affordable lunch option for both students and workers of the area, which is the case for me. Went there for lunch on a Monday noon, and ordered their Uniburger trio which consists of a burger (single patty) accompanied with fries and a drink. Total was around 11$  I received a generous amount of fries, which were fried to almost perfection with the right amount of crispy (in my opinion, but might be too crispy for some). The burger itself was kinda small but the flavor made up for it. It was indeed very tasty, especially the \"Uniburger\" sauce.   Overall, would recommend if you need your burger fix on a budget! Also fairly quick service."}
{"text":"Ordered their Uniburger which looks like a double cheese with lettuce, tomato and their secret Uniburger sauce. The patty is juicy and tasty but sadly the tomato and lettuce were very cold, in particular the tomato, which was frozen? The burger tasted really good but to the cold ingredients in the middle of my burger took the experience away.   Hot & Cold is great for dessert, for a burger, not so much...  When I ordered, I went with the combo option and I was given a huge portion of fries and an empty cup for their generic fountain soda. The fries were crisp but I REALLY didn't like them. It felt like they were cooked in oil that didn't seem very fresh and it tasted gross and very salty.   I'm not a fan of fountain soda and this was no exception. Furthermore, the soda was even more watered down more than anticipated. Very cheap or badly maintained. I could barely recognize the generic root beer they had going in there.  This franchise of Uniburger fell far short of my expectations. I'm sure I would have enjoyed their greasy and pretty burger but the laziness of its preparation robbed me from enjoying it. This laziness carried over to the rest of the eating experience. The fries were fried in old oil, they overly salted the fries. On this note...  PLEASE DON'T SALT THE FRIES LIKE A SAVAGE.   Under-salting is fine, you can always add more salt! You can never go back from over-salting!  LAZY LAZY LAZY  I'd go to another franchise to get an another honest try for their burger and I'd like to try their shakes. Everything else sucked, including this franchise location."}
{"text":"The most similar burger joint to In-N-Out that I've found on this side of North America - and I wouldn't have thought that I'd find it here in Montréal! We both got the trio (burger, fries, soda) with different toppings. The sauce was similar to In-N-Out's secret sauce. The food was cooked to order and came out fresh off of the grill - and perfectly cooked. The fries - cooked in peanut oil - were some of the best I've had - wish I could've gotten them as part of Poutine! The burger was perfectly cooked and I was completely satisfied with my meal. The soda machine made it easy to take advantage of their free refills. Lots of Foodora and other delivery service people were coming in and out to pickup orders. Menu has English translations and cashier spoke English and French."}
{"text":"Quality inconsistent. Resembles In&Out or Shake Shack.  Recently they launched an online ordering/delivery, yet seems they haven't figured out the basic logistics as the system is none functional indicating to call to place an order. Employees are unaware and phone orders not accepted."}
{"text":"Dire que je suis venu moultes fois et que je n'ai pas encore fait d'avis !  Leurs burgers sont simples mais efficaces, j'apprécie le fait que lorsqu'on les récupère de leur comptoir ils sont bien chauds et c'est parfois dur de ne pas se brûler par envie de se jeter dessus ;)  Il y a peu de choix en termes de sandwich : hamburger, cheeseburger ou uniburger (sauce spéciale) et on peut ajouter différents topings au burger sans supplément (excepté bacon avec supplément). A vous de choisir entre un steack ou deux steack et c'est partis la commande passe en cuisine ! Ils sont servis dans des petites feuilles plastiques qui permettent de les prendre en main sans trop se salir. Bien sûr cela coule et pour ma part je ne suis pas fan de ce service car on perd du fromage dans le plastique ... Pas super et en plus cela fait des déchets pour pas grand-chose ! La viande est correcte et le pain peut déstabiliser la première fois pour ceux qui aime les pains un peu plus ferme car ils sont plus mous. Les frites sont dans la moyenne !  Tout cela fait que vous avez devant vous un burger simple mais bon, qui ne fait pas de chichi avec des mélanges extravagant et surtout bien exécuté   Au niveau des prix c'est aussi dans la moyenne avec la possibilité de prendre un trio pour quelques dollars de plus.  En conclusion c'est toujours un plaisir de venir ici avant d'aller au cineplex d'à côté ou alors en attendant un spectacle dans ce quartier bien vivant :)"}
{"text":"Never been to the actual place, but I've ordered from it many times. Absolutely great burgers and fast delivery time. Recommended if you are looking for something to eat at home."}
{"text":"A fast food alternative to the big chains, Uniburger does a great burger at a reasonable price. The burger was made to order and tasted fresh and juicy. Not a destination, but a great option if you are in the area and want a quick bite!"}
{"text":"I gotta say the food lived up to the hype. However, It wasn't exactly what I had expected. I'll start with the cons first . The place is a bit dirty, it smelt like old mop juice that had been sitting in the bucket for weeks. The counter/staff guy wasn't the most welcoming either , which wasn't too much of a big deal since the menu is pretty straight forward. I would have expected a bit of a throwback 60s feel to it but it was actually dead silent with no music and a bit of an eerie vibe All that being said , the burger was amazing . If you're going to just pick it up and leave it's ABSOLUTELY worth it. The burger is juicy and it seems like they soak the bun in butter,  ( not sure so don't quote me on that) which is super delicious. The fries are goood as well even though it seemed like they weren't the freshest.  Vibe wise, thumbs down, food wise , ten thounsand thumbs up!"}
{"text":"The first time I was introduced to this very simple and wonderful establishment, I was not sure what to expect. Walking in to the place I was a little hesitant, but still curious. After waiting about 5-7 minutes for my burger and fries I glanced down and was thinking to myself \"ah just another plain old burger\". To my surprise after taking my first bite I was under the uniburger spell. It was so tasty and fresh. The fries were golden and perfect. I love this simple burger and fries joint and I will be returning often. Long live uniburger!!"}
{"text":"So...uniburger is great (we are from LA and it's our in n out sub here, and we order/pick up quite often) but lately when we go there's one kid working who always says they're out of fries, or that there's no grilled onions, or that they're out of uniburger sauce. It's always during the day or early evening when they're not busy. What's up with that? Pretty weak when the only thing on the menu is burgers. I'm expecting him to actually say \"sorry we're out of burgers\" next time we go"}
{"text":"Probably the best fries I have tasted and the burger is close to the second. I always wanted to try Uni burger while passing this place but I never got the chance.   The place looks like a typical restaurant with a simple menu. The price is what you typically find at regular chain like McDonald, burger king and A &W. What makes this place stand out is the quality of the food. Have you ever taste a uni burger made fresh for a few minutes by the server/cook, you need to try this!   The price is right but the food is anything but a typical fast food meal. Let the meals transport you back to a time when you are a  child where eating a burger is the best thing in the world and the food isn't made by crappy ingredients."}

{"text":"Best burger in town. Very tasty, easy to eat and not expensive. Also the fries are nice."}
{"text":"The restaurant's owner supposedly started this place after he returned to Montreal from a trip to Southern California, where he experienced the delight that is In-N-Out. So he sought out to replicate the experience in Montreal. Unfortunately, they don't do animal style here. All in all, it's a good replication in terms of taste, but you should expect to pay more than your typical trip to In-N-Out.  I highly recommend getting the burger with their special sauce. It's obvious that the special sauce (and In-N-Out's spread) is Thousand Island dressing, but an In-N-Out burger (and it's imitators) simply cannot be an In-N-Out burger without that spread. With that caveat, they do a great job imitating the In-N-Out burger. The spread tastes right, the bun is well toasted, and the burgers are cooked right.  The fries here are fantastic, better than In-N-Out's fries (INO's weak point IMO). The fries are thick, unlike INO's thin fries. The fries are crispy and not floppy like INO's. And they fried it in oil that actually has flavor.  The milkshake is okay, but I like INO's better. INO's milkshake is thicker."}
{"text":"Super gros burger gras qui coule à terre. Si tu veux vraiment te gâter va là et paye toi le uni-double extra bacon. Awaye donc, tu te mettras au régime après. La place est super ptite et le service excellent. Encouragez donc cette petite place au lieu d'aller payer le mcdo.  Si t'aimes pas, jva personnellement te rembourser en partageant ma prochaine frite avec toi."}
{"text":"TLDR: Best simple burger in the city.  Honestly, this is my favourite burger in the city. It literally looks like the ideal burger from a comic book. Fluffy bun sandwiching a juicy patty, with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, all topped with Uniburger sauce.   Not only did the burger look comic book perfect, so did the joint itself. The service was good, and you know the burgers are made fresh as it takes several minutes to receive them.  Simply seasoned and perfectly cooked. If you have a burger craving, just go to Uniburger!"}
{"text":"Uniburger's food is really delicious. I definitely won't take that away from them... however, if the service was somewhat close to decent, I'd give them a full 5 stars.   Every time I make the 5 minute trek to the Cote des Neiges location, I end up getting home 45 minutes later because there's always only 1 person at the register handling cash AND making the burgers (which by the way, concerns me in terms of hygiene). Anyway, everyone including the owner always seems miserable and bothered. Rude as can be. Last night was probably my last time at Uniburger. I rarely let crappy customer service divert me away from amazing food, but good grief! To see that 1 employee turn away 5 people due to being overwhelmed with orders (there were 2 other people in the restaurant) was nuts."}
{"text":"Unbelievably Mindblowing Burger experience... all that AND a delicious milkshake on top of it. It's all perfect, ALL. The real Two all-beef patties, special sauce, burger if you ask me, I'm not gonna dissect it, just go, go and get some."}
{"text":"I have a great love for Uniburger. It's nothing fancy and it doesn't claim to be.   It's hidden and unsuspecting, but delivers such a great, simple burger.  I get the single burger: moist patty, lettuce, tomato, and a delicious sauce sandwiched between two squishy, doughy buns. Perfection.  The fries are just how I like them, thin, crispy, and salty.   I especially love the quality for the price."}
{"text":"Yummy burger! Someone compared this place to In-and-Out and I think that's a fair comparison. Their 'Uniburger' has a sauce that they compare to a big-mac sauce, which was pretty much what it tasted like!   The only thing that dampened this experience was speed of service. We waited for about 25 minutes for our order, and I think it was because they were fulfilling to-go orders."}
{"text":"These burgers taste like they're made with high end Big Mac patties! Not a lot of variety, and really nothing all that special, but what they do, they do well."}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 3/5 Located on Rue Ontario E and Rue Sanguinet. Very easy to miss because this is such a hole-in-the wall location.  [SERVICE] - 3/5 My friend and I ordered takeout but we realized we received the wrong order (we got a Simple Uniburger instead of a Double) after we drove 5 minutes away from this place. We drove back, informed our cashier, he was quite apologetic, and gave us the correct order.   [DÉCOR] - 3/5  Clean, small, typical fast-food atmosphere.   [ORDER] - 3/5 Double Uniburger - $8.75: patty was average, not ridiculously juicy. The bun was soft, but there wasn't anything too special about the rest of the burger.   [OVERALL] - 3/5 Average burger. I think the components of the burger were too soft and one-dimensional. I wanted to like the iconic Uniburger from Montréal but sadly, nothing blew me away."}
{"text":"Uniburger is a fast food joint making delicious hamburgers for your enjoyment.  This particular location is pretty small and is located right on Ch. Cote des Neiges not far from the metro.  The menu here is very simple featuring only a few types of burgers, fries, onion rings and milkshakes made from Bilboquet ice cream.    It draws a lot of comparisons to In-N-Out Burger in the States and having experienced both I can see where they come from.  The food is presented in a similar manner to the way In-N-Out does it and the restaurants have a similar appearance.  Heck they even mention that they hand cut their fries and fry them fresh which is another thing In-N-Out does.  What sets them apart though is that Uniburger is much better in terms of quality.  As I said the menu is really simple here so I went with a good old-fashioned cheeseburger and fries.  You customize your burger here when you order and they have all the classic toppings and their own special Uniburger sauce.  The patty was really juicy and they used a good amount of cheese (a big plus with me).  The fries were golden, crispy and well-seasoned.  They had just the right amount of salt for me.  The price was also reasonable.  I paid $11 for this plus a fountain drink.      One thing they need to do is have one staff member working cash while the other works the kitchen.  On my visit there was only one guy doing both tasks and he could have benefited from having a coworker.  Around the cash area someone had clearly spilled food at some point.  It was there when I arrived and it still wasn't cleaned up by the time I left.  It also is better if one person is handling the money while the other handles the food hygiene-wise.  Uniburger makes a mean hamburger.  I know I'll be back in the future for more and you should check it out too when you get the chance!"}
{"text":"I was a Five Guys loyalist for a long time and kept hearing about Uniburger as having a better burger.  I finally got to go today and it did not disappoint. The service was slow but the wait was worth it.  The Uniburger is perfection without bacon. Next time I'll add bacon.  I reminded me of Shake Shack in the US or The Good Burger in Spain. It's perfect on every front. The meat, the bread, the ingredients, the sauce, I don't know where to start.   It is without a doubt the best burger in Montreal, hands down."}
{"text":"First trip to Montreal and I came here with a friend a few days ago because I found this place on yelp and read several reviews saying it was a great burger place, the Montreal version of In-N-Out burgers. Since I love In-N-Out burgers, I felt that it was a must during our trip. I was a little worried about the bad reviews here, which mentioned a bad manager/owner.  Right outside, there was a menu posted on the door, and I figured that I wanted just a double cheeseburger, along with tomatoes, lettuce, uniburger sauce, fried onions and hot peppers, for $6.99 canadian. When I got to the counter, the prices were different (higher, 7.49 for my choice).... and I ended up spending somewhere in the mid $8 after taxes. Felt like unpleasant bait and switch.  After sitting down, the manager or owner came out from the kitchen and practically yelled to my friend \"You can't have that here. You can't drink it in here.\" He was referring to a bottle of ice tea my friend had on the table that he picked up at the grocery store. We were a bit speechless because it was quite sudden. I mean, its quite fine to not allow outside drinks inside a restaurant, but this guy had practically 0 customer service skills, and probably scared off many other patrons.  After putting the ice tea away and waiting a short while, our burgers came out. It looked great, despite the very greasiness of the whole thing. The taste itself was pretty underwhelming.... I mean, it wasn't bad, the toppings tasted nice and fresh, and the bun was nice too... but the meat and the whole burger in general just didn't taste all that special, especially compared to how great In-N-Out is. Living in NY, I also have had many better burgers in my city, and Uniburger just felt very average regarding the price to tastiness value.  3/5 stars on just the burger -1 star for bait and switch pricing when original prices aren't exactly cheap to begin with -1 star for shitty attitude of owner/manager 1/5 stars overall - stay away"}
{"text":"Very good fries. Has free refill. Shakes are good. Tasted the uniburger it was good, it reminds me of Wendy's burgers. Topping can be added at no extra charge, but they don't tell you explicitly thst you can add them."}
{"text":"Honnêtement, un gros bof ! Assez surpris des nombreux avis positifs ici. Pour ma part, j'ai pris le Trio Uniburger (9,49$), ça ne m'a pas jeter par terre, je n'ai pas été impressionné du tout après en avoir entendu beaucoup parler depuis son ouverture. De plus, le préposé était bête avec ma copine. On était les seuls dans le restaurant, si on peut appeler ça un restaurant, car ça à l'air à mon avis, d'une vieille cantine trash dans une banlieue miteuse quelque part aux États-Unis. Aucune décoration, pas super propre. Ça a été la première fois et certainement la dernière pour ma part ici. Je pense clairement qu'à Montréal, il y'a d'autres lieux qui servent de meilleurs burgers de qualité et ambiance plus chic + déco qu'ici.  2/5 visité en septembre 2016"}
{"text":"This milkshake is sure to bring all the boys (& girls) to the yard, as the song goes! It's good, nice sizing, two classic flavors (vanilla and chocolate) to choose from. I think that applies to the short menu as well: they offer few choices, but they prepare them well. I had the single patty Uniburger with added fried onions (0,50$) and bacon (1,50$). I can't think of anything specific to complain about. However, I felt less satisfied with my meal than when I pick-up from Five Guys. Still, the two are quite similar.   In spite of the fact that the location is tiny-tiny, the decoration is thoughtful. I bet that next summer, it will grow more popular as people are often interested in grabbing something to eat prior to a lazy afternoon in George-Étienne Cartier park."}
{"text":"Ingrédients de très bonnes qualités, le burger est tasty, une bonne place pour savourer rapidement un bon burger !"}
{"text":"This place has a lot of potential to be one of the best burger joints in Montreal. The ingredients in the burgers are always fresh and the fries crispy and delicious. The mayo sauce they put in the burger is also really good and reminded me a bit of the Shake Shack / In n Out sauce.  However, I've been to uniburger about 5 times and my the biggest concern when it comes to this place is that they aren't really consistant with the execution of what seems to me like really simple things to cook : fries and burgers. Sometimes the fries won't be cooked enough, other time the meat will be pink/red in the middle.   Do it! Just make sure they cook your food properly ;)"}
{"text":"Tout récemment installé dans les anciens locaux de Café Frida, pour ceux qui connaissent le coin, c'était la première fois que j'essayais la bannière Uniburger.   On nous propose un menu de burgers assez simple. Hamburger original, Cheeseburger et le spécial Uniburger, que j'ai d'ailleur essayé, qui contient une sauce maison de style mayo assaisonnée. Le tout était bon spécialement les frites de type julienne bien dorées et croustillantes. Je n'ai pas vu d'option poutine à leur menu.....un manque à mon avis et je ne sais pas si la viande hachée est fraîche ou decongelée.   Bref, parfait pour prendre un take-out (l'endroit est assez minus) ou pour une livraison à un prix très correct soit autour de 10$ en trio. Par contre, si vous recherchez plutôt un burger de type gourmet vous risquez d'être un peu déçu, mais je ne crois pas que ce soit l'objectif de l'établissement."}
{"text":"Fairly standard burger-y place, with staff who don't really give a damn it seemed. Not particularly impressive or anything. Soda machine was on the fritz."}
{"text":"Gotta say best cheeseburger ever in all of mtl !!! Taste just like american classic burgers 1000%  I go to FLA often.... This compares man all the wayyy !!    Looking for gorgeous European ceramic tiles and Quartz counters ... Come see me    Jason Lucia    Royal Ceramics"}
{"text":"I went to Uniburger out in the Latin Quarter. I had heard and read some great things about this simple burger joint so I was excited to try them for the first thing. The place is no frills - simple tables, no fancy decor and a plain fast food-like counter to order from. The menu is short and sweet - hamburgers, cheeseburgers, their signature \"uniburgers\", fries, soft drinks and milkshakes. I respect a place that says \"this is what we do, no more, no less\". If a burger place is good, it doesn't need a poutine or chili fries or desserts or any number of random extra dishes. Just serve us a kick ass burger, fries and a shake. And Uniburger nails that perfectly.  First up, the milkshake - chocolate or vanilla but using Bilboquet ice cream. Simple but again, the use of great ingredients makes all the difference. Perfectly smooth texture with a great richness from the Bilboquet ice cream. when you can see the vanilla bean in your milkshake you know you are dealing with a proper vanilla milkshake.  The fries are pilled high, perfectly golden crispy on the outside but still soft enough on the inside. No grease at all present and perfectly salted off the bat. Love the salting prior to receiving the fries. These guys know how to make fries.  For the week, Uniburger added bacon to their classic cheeseburger. Lettuce, tomato and Uniburger sauce which is essentially a variant on a big mac sauce. The entire thing is stacked between a potato bun and my god is this a great burger. Pretty much the best classic burger I have had in Montreal to date. Everything here is perfect - the soft potato bun, the juicy beef patty, the melted cheese, the crisp iceberg lettuce, the tangy Uniburger sauce and the fatty fresh bacon. If I hadn't planned other burger visits that day, I would have had at least one more. I have now found my burger joint until further notice. Uniburger lived up to the hype and then some.   Cheers!"}
{"text":"Got a single uniburger with the combo. It was about 12$ after taxes. It was quite tasty and I'm definitely full. When I first go the burger, I thought it was quite small. However, the burger and the fires filled me up, so no complaints!   The patty was not to thick nor too thin, it was the perfect thickness. It had lots of lettuce and tomatoes and the sauce was pretty good. Overall, not a spectacular burger, but definitely good for a fast food burger.   The fires were pretty great. They were thin and crispy. Just how I like them! And they weren't too oily.   The restaurant is pretty small, but we were the only ones who ate in. Everyone else took their things to go.   Pretty great experience. If you ever crave a nice little burger, this place won't disappoint :)"}
{"text":"Sometimes, you just crave a good burger, a classic cheeseburger with good old American cheese (none of that brie or blue cheese non sense... please). Uniburger is just that: old school, fresh, simple and most of all delicious.  The burger is somewhat reminiscent of the burger from In N Out (my favorite). The  beef patty is nicely caramelized and a little pink in the middle. The fries were really really good.   There is a tons of options for toppings that you will need to ask to include in your burger. If not, your burger will only come with lettuce and tomatoes.  Some people would call the decor bare (white walls, no decorations, just a plain lightbulb for lighting).   In all, a very good burger joint that's worth trying. Suggestions to the owners: an \"Animal style option\" and extend your hours if possible. Your burgers would be a great pre or post drinking snack :)."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from here using UberEats. I'm a fan. The burger is somewhat comparable to the one from Five Guys (in my book, a high compliment for fast food). Very similar style - some choice of fixins (less than Five Guys), option for two patties that are fresh, inclusion of gooey cheese. I think the price point is slightly higher than Five Guys (but not substantially different) - though this may be a thrid-party delivery markup (I haven't checked). Certainly not expensive.  The main differentiator between Uniburger and Five Guys is probably the option to get a milkshake from the former (Remark: Five Guys offers this as well at some locations - but, last I checked, not in the Montreal Old Port location). The Uniburger name suggests that their \"Uniburger\" option should be a differentiator as well - but I don't feel this is the case. Slightly difference sauce - no biggies (for my taste buds at least)."}
{"text":"I was kind of disappointed by Uniburger! I would rate this place 2.5 overall. After seeing posts on Instagram food accounts of the melting cheese on their burgers, I was really excited to give it a shot but I was really underwhelmed when I actually tasted it. The burger was SO greasy, and that says a lot coming from a girl that loves McDonald's burgers. The beef was crumbly and the burger severely lacked flavor. It wasn't a nasty burger, but it wasn't tasty either, it was just simply OK.   The fries were honestly the worst fries I've ever had. They were thinly cut, didn't have ANY salt on them, and on top of everything else they were soggy. I read in other people's reviews that uniburger was very inconsistent with the quality of their food and perhaps maybe they were having a bad day. All in all it wasn't a horrible meal (excluding the fries of course), however I don't think I'll go out of my way to try it again."}
{"text":"Of course is more tasty than McDonald but is not wow really, good for quick snack when we dont have time for healthy choice ;) . Small place mostly to take out."}
