{"text":"This is flatbread (Afghan style) central my friends. If its not here, it does not exist. Real good flatbread styles from the other side of the world. Oh and the deserts are real good too, take them to go. In goodness they have tea and such on the house, as is custom. Moustafa runs a good operation here, along with the ladies kept in back. As custom too, lots of smoking and chatting outside, no need to rush off."}
{"text":"I wholeheartedly didn't want to be the only person who didn't like this restaurant but I needed to leave a review. 

I ordered the chipotle chicken wrap. The chicken tastes like it came out of a cheap box in the frozen aisle for 99 cents and they threw it in the oven or deep fryer. Not good.
I threw the rice pudding away after a couple bites. 

The only great thing about my meal was the bread. I would come back to order the bread. 

This isn't my first time trying Mediterranean food as well. I regret ordering from this business."}
{"text":"Good place for food and it is halal. My friends and I come here every saturday morning for breakfast. I like the lahaam mageen."}
{"text":"This food tastes like it came straight from Lebanon, a ticket straight to the land of milk and honey (literally, try the Kefir plus Honey). 100% authentic flavor from someone who lived there and grew up around this food. The meal is comparable to my mother's breakfast spread and it is absolutely to die for. Worth every minute of the wait it took to get here. The portions are plenty and we have a second meal left over for tomorrow as we were not expecting what the portions would be like. We had delivery but my next stop is going to be in person to see all what else they offer (Bakery?? Kenafa?? oh my...)"}
{"text":"Very fresh pastries , their food is amazing, friendly stuff, fast service , I highly recommend it"}
{"text":"So authentic! My only complaint is that our falafel wraps weren't super full, but for the cheap price it was understandable. We really enjoyed their hummus. My Palestinian boyfriend gave it his stamp of approval so we will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"The flatbread here is delicious!  My husband and I had both the cheese and the fresh spinach and will be back for more.  So much more than a bakery.  The owner is super nice too."}
{"text":"Best Arabic food in valley. Food tastes just like in Middle East. They bake their own bread which is really good with foul and hummus. Their falafel are the best I've had in the valley."}
{"text":"Most delicious bakery ever and creative dishes
Great people and nice balcony, i wish to try every thing in once"}
{"text":"Their pies are the best. The wraps are yummy like something you would do at home just delicious. The service is excellent."}
{"text":"Best food in town for my business meeting diner. I'll be back for more of that kunafa. Thanks for the best service Abdul."}
{"text":"Their muhallabia pudding is killer!! A must try; excellent prices and excellent food"}
{"text":"It's one of my best bakery ever.  highly recommend. Fresh delicious hot from the oven"}
{"text":"A hidden GEM! This place is just like my father used to cook. I had the hummus, falafel and chicken shawarma..finished with hot tea and fresh mint and kanafe for dessert..ALL delicious and reminds me of home. A flavorful must try and definitely worth a trip!"}
{"text":"I have never met a more gracious business then this one. The honey cheese is great and so is the hummus. The food was amazing but the tea was better, and I am a tea purist. Defiantly coming back."}
{"text":"Food is amazing, service is not. I never go there and get the food within 30 minutes, oone time it took an hour. always a long wait, which, in many cases have given me an execuse to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Always fun to try foreign cuisine. Have not had much food from the middle east, but most of what i had was pretty tasty!"}
{"text":"Total hole-in-the-wall kind of place but OMG the food is AMAZING! So unique and delicious. If you're in the neighborhood make sure you stop by this gem."}
{"text":"If you are going for ambience or convenience, this place is not for you.

But if you are looking for some great middle eastern food with fantastic prices and good service, this ticks all the boxes.

Literally a hole in the wall with basic amenities but you will forget all that when you get your food.  The food here is fantastic and if you love middle eastern food, this is a must try place.

I second someone's earlier review about the best falafels.  Actually everything I've tried here is good and they have fresh pitas right out of the oven with the food.

I keep going back to this place atleast once a week because I am hooked on their food.

It is family owned and very simple and basic set up but if you are looking for great food, this is the place to go.

The fare is Palestinian so you get to try some different type of ME food unlike Lebanese or Turkish food."}
{"text":"AMAZING. This place is the real deal. It's very authentic- from the smells to the tastes to the paint on the wall and Vimto in the cooler. I got the chicken shawarma and it was to die for. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Visited the Golden Restaurant and Bakery this week as part of a Restaurant Crawl organized by NEDCO. Two days later I find myself back ordering their delicious flatbreads with saut√©ed spinach and cheese and the Zartar Manakeesh that has thyme, sesame seed, oils and spice. The falafel is delicious as well. Golden specializes in flatbreads. Can't wait to try them all."}
{"text":"Came here last week the food is really delicious. I had good experience the staff was very friendly as well. Definitely would recommend people to try this place out . You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Best pastries \"mna2eesh\" in Phoenix; also the shawarma beef wrap is top notch. Hummus and falafel are great.
Kibda is amazing, great place and great people"}
{"text":"The food is very good there! I love their Hummus :)
I am definitely going again. The Falafel Is very good also and fresh.."}
{"text":"My first time here.... and I'm officially a pig. This was delicious food!! I had the chicken and cheese wrap that had the veggies in it with garlic sauce. I wish I had ordered two (remember, I said pig). It was tender and juicy and the bread is phenomenal! Momtaz!! I ordered spinach pies for later, but between my coworkers and my infinite love of spinach and desire to try more from this place, they are gone. So delectable. Their bread is something I could eat ALL DAY!

Keeping it from getting my 5-star rating is the salt. I had the hummus with their fresh bread. It was soooo salty and had tons of oil on top. You couldn't taste the tahini and barely the chickpeas. All you tasted was salt and garlic... not that I'm complaining about the garlic. Their spinach pies, although very good, were also on the salty side. I think their food would taste much better without all the salt. Let the spices do the talking! 

I will be back though. Salt aside, their food is wonderful!"}
{"text":"The \"jombo falafel (sabbah)\" wrap was delicious, huge, vegetarian, and a fair price.  If I lived in this neighborhood, I would eat here weekly.  May this restaurant thrive for centuries!"}
{"text":"At least once a week I have to order from Golden Bakery. I truly wish to see Golden Bakery grow throughout Arizona and not just in Tempe. I'd love to have a location up in Scottsdale. I don't mind driving to Tempe for this amazing food. Hands down Golden Bakery gets 5 STARS from me. Anything you order from this restaurant is the best. It's always fresh and ready to eat. Truly love Golden Bakery. The best Arabic food in all of Arizona. It really is #1"}
{"text":"I am from Lebanon and I love \"mne2ich\" I saw some pictures about this place and saw the high rating which encouraged me to go and try it. I tried different stuff my favorite was the Thyme one it was awesome I would definitely go back to eat it. I also tried the falafel they were really good. The meat one was not very special to me, but my friend liked it so good job. As for the cheese one it was the only disappointing one for me because it is not similar to the one I know, I think they should use a different kind of cheese to make it and be more generous with regards to the cheese quantity. Overall it was good and as I said the Thyme one was my favorite!!"}
{"text":"Best flat bread food I've ever had and the staff super friendly and it's made from scratch and even tho they still fast so impressed"}
{"text":"awesome!! Great service, very friendly staff.  the hummus is out of this world, served with fresh bread.  I mean fresh!! piping hot fresh!  will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First thing, before coming here I recommend to call and order by phone since I ordered cheese and chicken and it takes around 25 minutes, 
I didn't know what to order since it was my first visit but it was good and light but not perfect.
I really liked the (Basbosa with Nutella) and wish that I got the European chocolate but I was on half diet.
Would recommend it to others and would come again if I came to Tempe again."}
{"text":"Great arabic food and service If you're looking for a place to try or arabic food, this might be the place for you."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Mediterranean cuisine, so I decided to check out this restaurant because of the great reviews. The staff was nice, and the restaurant was clean. Sadly, I was very disappointed. I ordered the falafel sandwich. It was extremely dry and a subpar sandwich. I hate to leave a bad review, but the food just wasn't very good."}
{"text":"This is a little gem.  I didn't know what to expect.  The place is tiny, you place the order at the counter and then they will bring it to you.  They offer free tea (hot), very tasty.  We had the Safiha Balbaki, which is like a flatbread pizza that has ground beef, tomato, onion, garlic, bell pepper, pomegranate molasses and spices.  We also ordered the Labani Chicken, similar flatbread with kefir cheese topped with shredded chicken, avatar, paprika and hot sauce.  Both were delicious and pretty large for the price.  Each was less than $4.  I had an order of hummus, it came with fresh baked pita, so carbilicious!  Will be back to get pictures next time."}
{"text":"Was picking up dinner for a few of us who are taking a class in the evening.
Someone suggested Golden Restaurant and Bakery - good call!

I don't know exactly what all we got - I asked the gentleman who was taking orders for his recommendations - he suggested several items and I added an order of hummus and some baklava.

Everything was really good!  We had no leftovers.  Can't wait to go back!

(Hint - if you're in a hurry, you can order on-line - it's made to order, so it takes a bit of time)"}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean pies in town. Hands down! I've tried them all. Very diverse menu. Limited seating so I prefer take out. I would call ahead since they make the pies to order, therefore, it takes some time to get them ready."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Everything is made to order so everything is fresh. The menu is very diverse and cheap and you pay for the food after eating. Overall, I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Best tasting and authentic Arabic Halal cuisine in the area....and I have tried them all! Better than Green Corner & Haji Baba. This place has my business."}
{"text":"Yes yes yes! Mana2eesh in Arizona. OmG when I heard I was so excited and then when I tasted I was in love! Being a Lebanese and having lived in the ME all my life before moving not so long ago to the U.S., this was a great surprise. So happy I get to eat our lovely man2ooshe here in AZ. They have a variety of pies and the prices are perfect. The konafa is a little too expensive, but hey, if it's as good as the pies, maybe it deserves it. The whole family knows about the place now, it's gonna be even more crowded there. If you're going on a weekend, better reserve otherwise you will have to leave or eat standing! The place is small but the food is so good it keeps people coming back over and over again!"}
{"text":"Love it! Very delicious food and packing of food also in high level.
Pudding was awesome we enjoyed a lot."}
{"text":"One of the best kept secrets in all of Phoenix! Actually, Golden Restaurant and Bakery is in Tempe, ASU college town! Golden Restaurant and Bakery serve up freshly made, home style, made to Order, one of a kind REAL food! That's right; Golden Restaurant and Bakery use nothing but the finest ingredients you can taste and your mouth will thank you for how fresh each bite is!  Make sure you call in or order online ahead of time. Golden Restaurant and Bakery's best kept secret is its quality. Excellent prices too! Thank you Golden Restaurant and Bakery! Always a fan!"}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! Honestly the closest I've seen to authentic Turkish/Syrian cuisine, although not sure what ethnicity the owners are. Try the labani w/ black olives or the lavosh thing with cheese and honey. Heck, try everything. We over ordered, still ate everything, and paid 20 bucks. Only reason for knocking off a star is because of long wait for food. I wouldn't suggest if you're on a schedule."}
{"text":"Chicken Shawarma wrap is amazing! Comes with french fries in them :) super friendly staff, will become a regular!"}
{"text":"I love the hummus and pita here! The owner is very kind! I am so lucky to live down the street. My roommate and I order here any chance we get!"}
{"text":"Great place for people who love authentic Arab food. Don't mind the crampy space. The food makes up for it. I ordered the Safiha balbaki. In 10 minutes the food came out. The bread was soft and thin which is perfect and what I wanted. The ground beef was well mixed with spices and had a tangy flavor to it. 
All in all I totally enjoyed the food and will be back for more.
My only feedback will be to reduce the oil/grease on food. Just a bit scared when I saw oil dripping from the bread."}
{"text":"Good food very clean Very hotThis stuff Guys I like go to the golden bakery good stuff over there"}
{"text":"Very good went on  a restaurant crawl and Golden Restaurant was the last stop. They went out of their way to do a great job."}
{"text":"They have the most authentic Arabic food in the valley. Tastes just like In Jordan/Palestine and I've never experienced that here in the U.S. Amazing food- excellent customer service."}
{"text":"Quality food definitely! 
But my critique will be the unreasonable delay. For example, i waited 45 min for humus. Hope the owner of the restaurant fixes this issue."}
{"text":"One of the best bakeries i have ever tried, even when compared with bakeries in the Middle East."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants ever, reasonably priced and a great quality food. Zata'r  is my favorite meal in their, Nutella pie is also great and delicious. I would recommend this restaurant to anybody."}
{"text":"Amazing food. All around middle eastern styled bakery, they have many manakeesh toppings and provided excellent service. I also loved their \"adani\" tea. I noticed that their hours are very accommodating, i can drive by before work and grab my favorite \"oman\" sandwich with still enough time to grub on before i clock in."}
{"text":"Between this place and the Green Corner, Haji Baba has finally taken a backseat. This place is awesome, authentic, and very well priced!

I implore you to branch out here. I know that hummus and gyros and shawarma are like a dependable go to, but here you would be missing out on some good stuff. Give their zatar flatbread a try, it's soooo good. Their falafel is extremely good as well, and their hummus is ON POINT!

I'm itching to get back to try some other stuff as well. If you've never had knaffa, give it a shot here. It's a type of sweet cheese and it's soooo good. Not the best I've had, but it's the only place I've even found it stateside."}
{"text":"The best Mediterranean food and best service. It's a small place so I ordered for to go. Great price to buy these kind of food. I highly recommend it for all people."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. It is a super sketchy looking place, but the people are very friendly and helpful with the menu. You order at the counter and they bring it to you, but many people choose take out because it is a small place. We're vegetarians and tried the spinach/cheese flatbread, the jumbo falafel sandwich, and the hummus. All were great; the flatbread was delicious and covered with fresh spinach, you can taste the tahini in the hummus, and the sandwich is amazing. Truly, the best I've had. And there is a lot more on the menu I'd like to try, too, which is not always true for a vegetarian. 

I haven't tried the cake yet, but the pudding is wonderful, though it does taste gently of rosewater and I know not everyone likes that. Also! The prices are great; you can have two flatbreads for just a little more than $5. The man at the counter told me that he recommends people call and order ahead since everything is made fresh, but we ordered there and it only took about 10 minutes to get our food."}
{"text":"The staff here is so kind and helpful. If you are not familiar with this type of food, they will explain things and give suggestions for things that are always great.
The food is wonderful! Everything is made fresh, so be patient for it. Real food takes time bit is always worth it. And this stuff is worth it.
It is cramped in there, so ordering to go works best for me and my family. They do have outdoor seating, but during the summer it's not my first pick. But if you get cooler weather, your solid.
The dessert selection is wonderful! I love their baklava and their rice pudding. Come to think of it I have yet to find something I have not liked. 
This place is a true gem. Supporting independents are crucial to keeping the variety alive in the valley, and this place has hard working people that are offering fantastic foods for people to enjoy. Support them!!!"}
{"text":"After seeing this spot on Google Maps, I decided to give it a try. 
We tried a Spicy Meat Flat Bread, the Chipolte Chicken Wrap and some Hummus with Spicy Ground Beef and Chick Peas. Add a Barbican Pineapple Malt Beverage (Non-Alcoholic) and Dr P and we were set. 
The Hummus was very good and I loved the meat on it. The Wrap being a non-traditional item (the Chipolte Sauce) was very tasty with just a little burn. The Flat Bread was good and bad. Good flavor wise. The meat was wonderful. The bad, it wasn't chopped up as much as the photo on the menu making it hard to handle and it was very oily. It would have been nice if it had been chopped finer with some of the oil drained off before putting it on the flat bread. Next time I'll try one without meat. They all look so delicious. 
I ended up taking 1/3 of the flat bread to work along with a small Meat Pie, Spinach Pie and Chicken Pie. All 3 were good. I also grab a small order of Stuff Grape Leaves. They were OK, but reminded me of what you can pull out of a jar from any Middle-Eastern Market. All had the shape of being packed and not fresh. They were a little oilier than I prefer.
We also indulged in a Semolina Cake with Cream. It by itself made the trip worth it. They also had plain and Nutella filled cakes along with Baklava and these other things that looked like a birds nest. I can't wait to try one along with a Rice Pudding. The person who took our order said they add Orange Blossom Water to the Rice Pudding and they are very sweet. I'm totally game for that. I love the stuff in Lemonade and Baklava.
So the short of it. Great food for take away. Simple, delicious and worth the money and any drive to get here if your in the East Valley."}
{"text":"Golden Restaurant and Bakery is a small unassuming shop in the midst of a worn down part of Tempe. Their baked items and Middle Eastern delights are reasonably priced and delicious.

The menu is quite extensive and has various flatbreads, wraps, and entrees. There is a glass case under the counter that has various candies and delectable looking desserts such as kunafa and rice pudding. I decided on the shakshouka flatbread and had a few bites of a steak shawarma wrap. 

The flatbread was light and crisp, with a thin layer of egg, onion and tomato on top. It had a delicate taste and I liked the seasoning on it as well. It was served warm but by the time I had eaten half of the flatbread it had gotten cold already which made it less appetizing to me since I'm not a big fan of cold egg. The steak shawarma had a plentiful amount of thinly shaved beef with pickle, sauce, and onion. It was nicely seasoned and wrapped in some toasted flatbread.

We couldn't resist dessert after spying all the delicious goodies on display in the glass case! The rice pudding was thick, rich and creamy, with short grain rice and an interesting mix of flavor. I could taste some rosewater in it and I liked that it was lightly sweet. The rice itself was slightly too crunchy for my tastes. The semolina cake with cream was wonderful. I had it warmed, and I loved the mixture of the pudding-like cream with the soft semolina.

Service was friendly and warm. The gentleman at the counter was very nice and did give us a few suggestions for what to order. 

It was overall a pleasant experience and I'll be back to try more off their menu!"}
{"text":"Honestly, this place left me speechless. I love that some of the best meals of your life occur not at a fancy, upscale restaurant, but a tiny, unassuming hole-in-the wall. The place is small, there is no restroom, the a/c may or may not be working, and the floors could use a heavy dose of Pine-Sol. Despite all of that, this place gets 5 stars without hesitation. The food is phenomenal. Unbeatable. Delectable. Tantalizing.  

We tried a smattering of different foods: za'taar on flatbread, muhammara plate, hummus plate, fool plate, and falafel. The za'taar flatbread is nutty, salty, pipin' hot, and satisfying. The muhammara was sweet, yet spicy, with a terrific combination of spices.  The hummus was some of the best of my life. The chickpeas were well-balanced with the flavors of tahini, lemon, garlic, and olive oil. Topped with another drizzle of olive oil, parsley, and paprika. Just perfect. The fool plate was out of this world. Super lemony. SUPER garlicky. Super fava-beany.  Oh my god, my mouth is watering.  The falafel: fried to perfection.  As if this wasn't enough, our dips came with about 6 pieces of flatbread.  

You might think this would cost a fortune. Think again. Our total was under $20 bucks and we had leftovers. 

Folks, run (actually don't- you'll die from heat stroke) here for your next meal.  Actually, I'm going back tomorrow."}
{"text":"This is best place for middle eastern pastries in the Phoenix area. Fresh and made to order. Very reasonably priced. The entire spectrum of pastries is available. Recommend cheese, labneh and thyme based. I personally have not tried meat-based, but others have recommended them too. Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"This place is a small restaurant... To be small in place will never be a problem if you are looking for the best falafel sandwich in Tempe.... 
Falafel jambo... Is the best at this place"}
{"text":"Great place! Their food is absolutely delicious and the staff are great. One of the best mediterranean places in town, will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Delicious food my favorite is the cheese boat, free hot tea all the time, great service, and affordable prices."}
{"text":"We wandered into this wonderful quiet place for a late lunch, and it was terrific! The cheese boat and the falafel sandwich were very satisfying, and the complimentary tea and condiment bars were both a nice touch. With food and service as good as this, we just wish we weren't only visiting from NYC!"}
{"text":"I tried this place based on the reviews. I went back three days in a row! My girlfriend and I are hooked! I've tried a wide variety of flatbreads, and they were all awesome. Beef shwarma is ridiculously good. Grape leaves are a must. Service is always fast, and he is patient with me while I decide because I want to order everything on the menu. Definitely recommend this diamond in the rough.

Do yourself a favor and get the chipotle chicken pizza, and chicken wings. I know know Middle Eastern food.....and I recommend this! I am in the process of trying everything on the menu, and just had these. Food here is just on point."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch since it is right around the corner from home.  We had a couple of chicken shawarma wraps with fries.  AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS!!!!  This is a wonderful place....it has an outstanding menu that this loaded with so many choices, it is clean and the employees are so pleasant and nice. They have complimentary hot tea (which is perfectly brewed) as well as assorted vegetables.  I hope it stays at this location for a long time as there have been several other restaurants that were unable to last.  I can't wait to go back for more heavenly Mediterranean style food."}
{"text":"Amazing and yummy food, always fresh. Friendly staff. I go there all the time. Love the balabaki lahm bajeen."}
{"text":"Simple place.  Looks like it is more like a fast food Mediterranean place.  The grape leaves were good."}
{"text":"This is real middle eastern cuisine 

Tastes good

Great friendly service

I love this place ... Definitely coming again"}
