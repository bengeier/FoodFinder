{"text":"Spacious bar and a nice hang out spot. Good music and friendly crowd. I'm not sure if line dancing is their thing but we came here on a Saturday night and everyone was line dancing to hip hop music. Lol it's was pretty entertaining to watch. Before I end I have to stay the main reason for this review was to let everyone know that this place has THE BEST CHICKEN WINGS in town! Most check the out!"}
{"text":"My buddy is a Falls cop. Tells me to stay away from this place. They've had a few knifings in the parking lot this year alone and a woman was robbed at gun point. Needless to say I had to check it out for myself, low and behold I saw a cockroach in the bathroom."}
{"text":"Always a fun spot with many TV's for viewing sports games. There's also keno, pool, live DJ's on the weekends, great drinks, great bartenders/staff and great food. The atmosphere is laid back and people of all ages and walks of life gather here to have a good time."}
{"text":"Went here last night after dinner and boy has this place changed since I was there last! It's been about 5 years. They opened it up more and put another bar in. This bar is huge! Everything seemed clean and the bartenders were very nice. They were attentive despite the amount of people trying to order drinks. The music they played was mostly 90s based dance music. The restroom is the only thing I didn't care for. It was clean but there are only 2 stalls in the women's room. Also, the paper towel dispenser fell off the wall and was laying in the trash can. The floor was all wet from women shaking their hands off to dry them. Overall, cool place to hang out. Lots of TVs on the walls and the DJ did a good job. Drink prices were very reasonable as well. Not a lot of places to park in the front or back lots because you have Funny Stop across the hall and they pack people in over there."}
{"text":"Ohhhh dear.  Interesting crowd here..  Try not to offend anyone, you might get shanked!"}
{"text":"This place is just all around terrible. Horrible. Not very clean. Beer selection sucks. Service sucks. Everyone looks like meth addicts that work there. All the people sitting at the bar look like they've been ridden hard and put away wet. With that being said, I lost my appetite for the night."}
{"text":"Chose this place for my birthday for wings n beer since reviews were pretty good. Been there once before and remembered food was good....not so much yesterday Wings were either over cooked or under cooked- no consistency - spinach dip was dried up. Took a long time to get food- service was very slow for the tables/ to bar area- seems bar area had all the attention ... After all said and done got sick in the middle of the night so I wont be going back anytime soon... Transition of new menus or not- cook and wait staff wasnt good ... Sad and mad I went here to celebrate anything!"}
{"text":"I'm kind of in between 3 and 4 Stars. I'll go 3.87 Stars. But Yelp won't let let me do that.   First of all, this place is humungous. There's a huge dance floor, pool tables , bar, and seating galore. There are multiple large TV's for watching sports, so not a bad place to come for March Madness. I'm not sure what the dance floor scene is like, as we were here around 5 o'clock, but it would be interesting to find out.......   The food and service were great. Shannon was our waitress and she was soo nice. The cook came and checked on us which is always a good touch. When she was busy, the other waitress/bartender wasn't afraid to jump in the mix to help out. We ordered cajun dry rub wings, and burgers. We were pleasantly surprised with the how good everything was. I haven't had many bigger burgers in my life. It rivals Fudruckers for size. It's says 1/2 pound on the menu but seemed closer to 3/4 pound and was less than $10. Not only was it huge, but it was cooked like we asked and the bun was toasted. The fries were tasty too.   Like many reviews state, patron wise- it's definitely pretty \"towny\". If you're looking for a first date spot, this isn't the place. Honestly it's probably not even a good 73rd date spot. But if you want to watch a game, get some good bar food, cheap beers with the boys and aren't offended by hearing a substantial amount of cussing and a waft of smoke on the patio as you walk in, this is the spot. I guess it just depends what you're looking for."}
{"text":"The food is good. Beer selection is decent. I do like the atmosphere. Just don't show up on a Sunday or you get the annoying drunk regulars."}
{"text":"This is a great place under new ownership. Big bar with a great atmosphere went downhill for awhile but new ownership is making a real effort to rebrand and keep the riff-raff out. If you haven't been here recently give it another try and you will be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"A comfortable place .. where the staff is always welcoming.. And the specialty foods are delicious.. I personally  recommend  the armadillos  they are amazing .. And the bar staff is loaded with expert craftsmen in the art of cocktail making ! Great weeknight  dinner and drinks  Can get a bit hopping on the weekends"}
{"text":"The food was good and reasonably priced. The restaurant is much larger than I expected. The problem is that the jukebox is so loud you can't even talk, and some of the music is absolutely Raunchy. The service was OK, but nothing exceptional."}
