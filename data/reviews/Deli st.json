{"text":"Great new spot in Plaza Midwood. Quite possibly the best roast beef sandwich I've had in CLT. Large selection of great veggie choices too! They also have every drink imaginable to pick from. We've been three times and each time service has been fast and friendly."}
{"text":"They have a great menu and I love the separate menu for vegetarian/vegan. I ordered the Pecan Ave and it was delicious. However, the Pecan Ave is a vegan sandwich and I was informed, only upon asking, that the bread they serve it on is not vegan. They offer a vegan option, but it is an extra charge! I'm just not sure I understand the logic of having a vegan menu but then up-charging for vegan bread? While I loved my sandwich, I don't think I'll be going back until they start offering an accurate menu."}
{"text":"Awesome place!! Clean and fresh, friendly and fast! I've been there for a few times by now and I love it! Great fresh sandwiches to grab on my busy day.. will definitely see them again."}
{"text":"We visited Deli St for the first time yesterday and it was DELICIOUS. Prices are reasonable. They offer coffee, sandwiches, sodas, and local beer. The decor is lovely. It's a small place, but nice and cozy. Vegan/Vegetarian options. For those who aren't, try the Central Turkey!!"}
{"text":"Local beer selection: superb. Vegan selection: DELICIOUS!! We live only a couple blocks from this place and it has become a staple in our diet! The sandwiches are amazing every time and we love being able to try a new local beer every time we stop by. Definitely worth a stop by to check it out!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last night.  Here's the scoop on Deli St...

Parking:  Deli St is located right off of Central Ave and there's a decent little parking lot for Deli St. patrons.  There shouldn't be any issues with parking.

Ambiance/Set-up:  The best way to describe this place is Common Market meets NODA Bodega with a twist of Amelie's.  In addition to the tables/seating they have set-up throughout the inside, there are tables set-up on the small patio just out front.  There's plenty of natural lighting with clear views to the patio and Central Ave.   

Food/Drink: They've got a little bit of everything - plenty of craft/bottled beer, a few draft beers, plenty of nonalcoholic beverages, a wide variety of vegan sandwiches, breakfast sandwiches, wraps, clubs, salads, tortas, burgers, coffee, etc.  This place really does have something for everyone.  I got the 2 single IPAs and the \"Commonwealth\" sandwich - turkey or ham w/cheese, bacon, and honey mustard.  Sandwich didn't blow me away by any means, but was good enough for the price I paid. 

I hope this place stays around for a while - if nothing else, its another great location to pick up and/or have a few local brews.  I am positive I will be back, in fact their grand opening is this weekend - May 11th-13!"}
{"text":"Hope this place thrives- great lunch, breakfast, snack and beverage options for vegans and non-vegans alike- every sandwich I have had here is super tasty. A must try."}
{"text":"I live near Deli St and was always looking to see if it was open yet. It opened one month ago today and it's pretty darn good. Today I didn't want to pass again without visiting so I popped in for two to-go sandwiches. 
First of all, there is seating inside and out and the place is dog friendly. Pretty sure you can even go inside with your pup. They offer two coolers full of beer/cider and some bottles of wine. They also have canned juices like Bai. 
Their menus show offerings of sandwiches, bowls, smoothies, fresh juices and you can choose from an array of breads. 
They also offer coffee and sweets like cake. 
I'd read about the torta so ordered that as well as the central turkey. Both hit the spot but the torta is special. Each sandwich had a bit of spiciness to it which I appreciate. It makes me sad to get a brown and stringy avocado but that didn't happen here. It was rich and velvety and just made the torta that much better. On the central turkey, enough meat, fresh lettuce and a spicy spread. Cilantro fresh end up the sandwich too."}
{"text":"All of the sandwiches look great, I decided on Cindy's Turkey and I had no complaints. Also, have a good beer selections and a few on draft. Looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches for the price!  I've had most of the non-vegan ones and they are all good.  Staff is friendly as well and I like their homemade Bollilo bread."}
{"text":"Family owned, good service. Good variety of vegetarian and vegan and options! Tons of beer, and drink choices. Great for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Hey , first time I tried it, I liked it. It's in Plaza Midwood area. It's dicey, but clean. They have a wide range of beers and snacks, and lots of health nut options , but basic options as well , so you and all your friends can come. 

There is a little bit of table seating , a store length indoor window seating , and patio seating in the front with plenty of shade.

This visit I ordered bacon, egg and cheese croissant ( breakfast served all day) and a caramel latte. I peeped the coffee was locally sourced and it actually tasted delicious. The sandwich was great too, the bread was particularly fresh and I could tell the bacon was center cut ( my family's favorite kind of bacon lol). 

Check this chill spot out the next time in Plaza Midwood."}
{"text":"Deli St is in a super random place on Central Avenue.  Not too close to the main drag of bars/restaurants, but close enough where you can still be ok with driving a few minutes out of your way.

They have a pretty interesting menu of sandwiches and smoothies.  I was really just expecting your run-of-the-mill sandwich shop, when I was pleasantly surprised at the interesting selection of sandwiches for vegetarians and meat-lovers alike.  I personally had the Cindy's Turkey, which had a spicy mayo, turkey, avocado, pimento and more lettuce than you can imagine.  It was awesome.  They have some coolers for local beer at some great prices, so you should seriously consider just heading here for a beer and sit on the front patio.

Loving this new sandwich shop!  I was getting a little tired of going to the same places, so it's great to have a new spot to put into the rotation.  Staff was so incredibly welcoming, which is great when you walk in and people greet you with a smile."}
{"text":"We tried Deli St this evening and it did NOT disappoint!  We ordered the St. Julien and Plaza Torta, both recommended by the nice gentleman at the counter.  We took it to go but you can sit and order a local brew on tap.  There are also several options for vegans and vegetarians. 
Very clean and welcoming- you can also call ahead for pick up!   I look forward to trying breakfast and coffee very soon as we are only a short walk away! 
Looking forward you being a long term part of the community.  
Dog friendly too!"}
{"text":"Very much enjoyed the Deli St breakfast sandwich.  Got it on the signature Bolillo roll and at $3.95 you simply cannot beat it.  There are plenty of options for any food preference which is awesome.  The coffee was excellent too.

They had several tables inside and out, as well as counter seating against the front window so there is plenty of room.  Parking should be fine but may get a bit hairy during the busier times.  They had excellent customer service when addressing an issue during my visit as well.  

A welcome addition to the neighborhood, I look forward to riding my bike here and trying other menu items in the near future (I'm looking at you, Plaza Torta)."}
{"text":"I've been keeping an eye on this place since it was a Mexican restaurant. It is now a neat neighborhood deli. It serves a lot of pastries and sandwiches. The advertising says it is a \"bottle shop\" however it doesn't have a wide selection of beer, I wish they had fewer six & four packs of beer and a wider selection of individual bottles of craft beers that you could make your own six pack from, that would be cool to have in the neighborhood! I also wish they had a few more low carb options, I would eat there everyday if that was the case. They are heavy on the vegan diet and I don't believe that is what most people who see the word \"deli\" think. However the sandwiches I have ordered there are absolutely AMAZING (for a vegan place their chicken is awesome). The service is super friendly and the owner is great! It's a fun place to walk to and have a glass of wine with a friend without having to get in the car and drive anywhere which this neighborhood really needed! I would highly recommend trying this place out, and while I know most people who go in there are probably not vegan or vegetarian you can add meat to basically anything they have, they are always willing to help you make something exactly the way you want it and their food is beyond amazing! Once their beer and wine selection triples in size and their wine pours become more generous I will basically be living there when I am in the neighborhood. I will continue to edit this review based on how I see this really cool place grow into its own. We should all be happy to have this in our neighborhood and I highly suggest you give them a try. Even with my criticisms I am not hesitant to give this place 5 stars because in my eyes it is a young 5 Star restaurant that is on the verge of becoming super popular!"}
{"text":"Popped in this morning to grab a cup of coffee and discovered their awesome food menu. I went with the Morningside Breakfast on a plain wrap and my only complain is that no breakfast sandwich will ever taste quite as good after tasting this amazing item! Stop on in the next time you're driving down Central - it's 100% worth it!"}
{"text":"Quaint place, used to be La Unica and many other Mexican restaurants. A good selection of breads and sandwich types. My Central Turkey wrap was really solid, but slightly light on the amount of meat.  I added jalape√±o pimento cheese which was fantastic. Pick some up for a party! The chocolate chip cookie looked like it might be average, but it was really good! Very soft, fresh, and plenty of chips inside. Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Perfect spot for a sandwich and coffee! I was skeptical at first since I know this has been several restaurants before, but I think this concept is the one that's going to stick. Beautiful patio, great food, cool atmosphere. They have an entire vegetarian menu but I like meat so I had the Torta and it was so awesome! Fresh ingredients including like, an entire avocado for one sandwich. I also had a latte that was out of this world! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Was really excited to see a coffee shop on this side of Central Avenue, but was sorely disappointed in the customer service. Stopped to get a coffee on the way to work this afternoon walked in and was not really greeted.  Asked if they had coffee the woman told me yes and proceeded to list all their syrups. Asked if they had a menu of their coffee, she says no. I order a latte which comes back $4+, tell her to change it to coffee because $4 was not what I was trying to spend today. A gentleman working there was super nice about it, but the two women were all attitude about the coffee and the milk. Wished them a good day on my way out and both just talked amongst each other. I would really love to have an awesome coffee shop ok this side of the Harris Teeter, but after today I won't be back. Would much rather go to Central Coffee Co. where prices are listed and the staff treat you like family."}
