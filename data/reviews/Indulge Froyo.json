{"text":"Good yogurt. Poor toppings. Weird smell in building."}
{"text":"Friday 9/29/17. Walked in and the girl that was working the register was busy chatting with her friends sitting at the table next to her. There was toppings all over the floor in front of the topping bar and the bar was mess. Walked back to the yogurt machines and the drip pans at every machine were a mess. Floor was a mess. Turned to my son who was of course excited for some froyo and I said \"we are out of here, their not getting my money.\"  Good luck with that."}
{"text":"Was there today. Very clean and lovely atmosphere. I have three teenagers that come often and now I will be joining them. Happy to have them close to home."}
{"text":"First time there today, good froyo, good toppings and clean.  Little hard to reach some of the toppings but nice variety!  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great choices on flavors offered, lots of good tasting NSA and GF options. Business owners are great folks too!"}
{"text":"Fantastic taste and flavors... especially my all time favorite cake batter and second best cheesecake."}
{"text":"We usually go to Yogurtini but decided to give this place a try since it's a locally owned joint. We will not be returning. First, the decor.... Second, the froyo machines weren't working properly. Mixed flavors weren't mixed at all, and a couple were just liquid. Third, we couldn't reach anything in the back row. When we commented on it the cashier just sat back laughing as we tried. Fourth, the cashier was not friendly at all. Fifth, the tables were so dirty and the employee was just standing there on her cell phone. So back to Yogurtini we go."}
{"text":"I was so excited to check this place out especially today because it's so hot. My first thoughts were how awesome and bright the walls and chairs are inside. It makes the place feel more airy and happy. It was a little confusing to find where they keep the bowls, and we had to walk all the way to the back of the building next to s trash can to get them. I wasn't too impressed with the flavors of yogurt either. There was only about 7  to choose from. Toppings selection was good for the most part, but was really dissolved in the quality of fruit. I love strawberries in my yogurt and they were all soggy and reminded me of something that would come out of a can. Sigh . I opted for gummy bears and cherries instead. If you are looking for a quick treat this place will do, but if you want to be satisfied and better and fresher fruit I'd open for yogurtini a few miles away."}
{"text":"I love this frozen yogurt shop, the prices are great and there are some of the tiniest flavors. The PB is the best, I've tried a lot of other places but this one is my fave. The owner is so kind. They have fun games you can sit and play while you enjoy your Froyo. They are great at giving back to the city and that's amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious!!!!!!! I manage the Great Clips next door and the owners and staff are so friendly!! All our stylists love having a yogurt place right next door!"}
{"text":"too many bobas. Stopped by with my girlfriend. we liked all the yogurts and the toppings were really cool."}
