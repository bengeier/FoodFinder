{"text":"I heard a lot of good things about this restaurant from a few friends and decided to try it out to see what the hype was all about.  The hype is justified ... this is one of the best new restaurants I tried in a long time. The staff was friendly and helpful and the food was prompt and very tasty.  We had a variety of dishes and my absolute favorite was the black cod. It was tender, juicy and absolutely delicious.  The jumbo beef rib was very good too. It wouldn't be a great first date dish as it's messy to eat but I'd still highly recommend it. We are already talking about when to go back."}
{"text":"Definitely recommended!! Great new sushi (and Japanese grill) place.  It's better than the usual sushi:  fish seems fresher and better and it's more unique than the standard sushi fare you find everywhere (which isn't a bad thing, it's just nice to have something different now and again).  Also the grill dishes are really good and also a bit unique. Casual atmosphere with a bit of edge."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant, it doesn't look like much from the outside, but once you cross the threshold you see a dramatic change.  The sushi is the best I've had in Calgary, presentation was fantastic, and the fish was fresh and the portions were generous.  I will definitely be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Went early afternoon and we were the only table in the restaurant. My friend ordered the Sushi lunch combo/special which he said was average. I ordered the Chicken Katsu and rice. The sushi came out first, when he was midway done his sushi his starter Miso soup arrived. About 5 minutes after he was finished and his plates were cleared I received my Chicken Katsu. It seemed over cooked/breaded. Once the food had been dropped we were not once checked on and we had to stand at the front door for a couple of minutes to get our cheque and pay. Experienced mediocre food and horrible service, for those two reasons I will not be returning."}
{"text":"The food at Ke was really good and high quality. The flavors were on point with a great selection of unique items on the menu. The service we really friendly and they have a roof top patio! Perfect for the summer season in Calgary. Defiantly will come back again!"}
{"text":"We are so lucky to be just a block away from Ke Sushi and Grill. Inside the inconspicuous white building is a beautiful restaurant with the most amazing Japanese food. It's on the pricey side but totally worth it!  On our second visit we had the beef yakitori which just by looking at it doesn't look too appetizing but the flavour is the bomb! We could order about 10 more melts-in-your-mouth salmon sashimi but we were already full from the the oishi sushi, chicken yakitori, lobster roll and bacon wrapped tomato yakitori that we had that night. Customer service is also very good! Definitely more visits in the future."}
{"text":"WHOA. Yum. Really great fusion sushi! We shared the yellowtail and ahi tuna carpaccio, wild salmon oshi sushi, spicy tuna oshi sushi, and a spicy crunch roll. The spicy oshi sushi was so fresh because of the jalape√±o peppers on top, a very lovely way to have raw fish! Will come back again. :)"}
{"text":"The best service I have had at any restaurant in Calgary. My GF and I were greeted warmly by the whole staff when we opened the door.  The decor was excellent, as was the service. The staff was attentive and friendly, and the manager even came over and gifted my GF a box of pocci. We truly felt welcomed and valued.  While we waited for our order they brought out some fresh cook edamame with with salt. Don't eat the husks, well you can but they are pretty fibrous, and it is not the custom. Something fun to munch on while you wait.  We ordered the fried mochi (pounded rice cakes) and it was exquisite, as was the fresh high quality lamb, served on a hot stone, to cook as you like. We also had some gyoza to round out the meal. The prices are very reasonable.  They serve drinks, some sake, and some local favorites. They also had a drink special, I don't know where else in town I could get a pint of rickard's white for 4 bucks.  We also had some sesame ice cream which was rich and nutty, and very creamy/dense.  We had fun on our date, and this is a place I want to take my friends."}
{"text":"Calgary needed a sushi place like this, reasonably priced, great atmosphere and quality. The decor is above average, you can tell that they put a lot of attention to every detail and perhaps that's the reason why the grand opening of this restaurant was delayed by so many months.  As for their menu, their oshi sushi are delicious (especially the spicy salmon and philly), and so are some other items like the deep fried mochi balls, grilled vegetables and beef cuts. They also have a decent selection of sakes to choose from. Nothing I've ever tried at Ke has left me disappointed, or underwhelmed.  Service is very friendly, and for quite an experience, make sure to sit by the bar for a view of the always-busy kitchen.  Also noteworthy, they have adopted the Kinjo-esque practice of giving away Pocky sticks to women and children every visit! Ke is definitely a welcome addition to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I just love this place. I'm a regular now. The service is so good and the food is great. Tonight dinner for 3 came to $45. (One cocktail). I just can't express enough how much I love Ke."}
{"text":"One of the better sushi places in Calgary - still not comparable to the the taste and quality you get in Vancouver but it's definitely in my top 3 for Calgary. They have a good variety but in terms of price, I have to agree with some of the other reviewers - it's in $$$ range. Prices don't seem to be too bad on the menu but given the tiny portions, you'll have to order lots so it adds up."}
{"text":"The place isn't bad, we went there for yakitori but they don't serve it at lunch to we had to make do if what they do serve.  The decor/inside is very nice.  Their sushi/sashimi  selection was ok.  We got one sushi and the rice was not made correctly... the sashimi was good (tho there's not much for them to do there) and the beef tataki was good, citrusy, it was good for a warm day appi.  They have a huge roof patio so that was a plus.  Overall it was good, I'll come back to try the yakitori and skip the sushi/sashimi."}
{"text":"We had marinated tuna tataki for starter which was followed by Wild salmon Oshi sushi, 5 piece KE set, Hatsu, Kawa, G-onion Maki, lobster tail, Ebi, okra and some sushimi, California Oshi sushi, the special scallops sushi. The yellowtail sashimi was the best I ever had. The sashimi bowl was awesome. The quality of the food was really good. Don't forget to try red bean mochi with some vanilla ice cream! It's magical! :) Kate was very polite and helpful. I will definitely go back there."}
{"text":"Irasshaimase! It is pronounced:\"ee-ra-shy-ma-say\"  Is the correct way to say this Japanese greeting upon entering. It means welcome, come in. What's funny to me, is not one person here says it properly. To a person who doesn't know the Japanese language or heard anyone speak it, I guess it really doesn't matter. IMO, they should at least make the attempt to say it and then say \"welcome\" in english. I think a good portion of people don't know what is being said to them upon entering. Now onto the food. We all started with green tea, and water. You then check off on a piece of paper all the items you want to order. I found that this restaurant takes similar cues from Kinjo's Japanese restaurant's. The greeting upon entering, the \"Magic Steak\", all the way down to the end where Pocky's are given at the end of the meal. The exception being that only the ladies recieve them. Not the kids or men at the table. They have Yakitori available after 6 p.m. which we ordered 2 chicken skewers. the chicken was fairly tasty with a hint of BBQ flavoring. Also at the table we ordered the beef ribs.(2 to an order), they were tasty but the meat was dry. California roll.(different presentation) rectangular with the avocado and crab on the outside.tasty nonetheless. Gyoza, same as anywhere else. Shrimp tempura (greasy) but tasted fine. Zucchini skewers (Spicy), but good. and a couple of bowls of rice. This meal in it's entirety came to $92. and change.  IMO, it's pricey but tasty as well. Will I be back ?   Probably not. It's not because we didn't like the food. It's probably because of the price and distance from our home. We eat inside Japanese restaurants at least once a week, and when dining out with a family we are more aware of getting more value for your dollar. For now, I'll stick with Menyatai, Muku's, or Shikiji's."}
{"text":"What a surprise. Close to my house, unique and well executed menu and not crazy expensive. Will be heading back for sure."}
{"text":"The sashimi is excellent & so are the oysters. This is a great hang out place with good ambience & lively vibe. If you want excellent service, go little earlier as the quality of service is not as great during rush hour.  We ordered two kinds of ice cream & they got one of them wrong. Small price to pay!"}
{"text":"We were looking to try a new restaurant and came across this conveniently located Japanese restaurant in downtown Calgary.  I was especially curious since it featured a number of unique items not often found in other restaurants.  Atmosphere: 4.5/5  Very unique and thoughtful decor.  I like the wooden furniture which gives a more 'traditional' feel, yet the lighting and flooring generated a trendy ambience.  We were seated at the bar since the upstairs was full so I also had a great view of the open kitchen.  Interesting uniforms worn by staff.  I was surprised that it was not hard at all to find parking along the side street.  Good noise level for a relaxed atmosphere to catch up with friends.  Food: 4.5/5  We were especially curious about the unique menu items and chose some of their specialties: lobster salad to start, Phillidelphia oshi sushi, mango roll, charcoal grill chicken w cheese and beef skewers, and oysters to finish.  I love the variety on the menu esp the different types of grilling - we ended up choosing their specialty of charcoal grilling and I thought the meat was juicy yet tasty.  Oysters were wonderful esp w the selection of condiments that came with the dish.  The two rolls were also very tasty and well presented.  Overall great unique dishes - would love to try their other types of grilling eg teppan, stone grill and even deep fried dishes.  Service: 3.5/5  Overall friendly and efficient; happy to receive pocky in the end =)  Price: 3.5/5  Overall reasonable for variety, uniqueness of food and ambience  Overall: 4.5/5  Great experience in this Japanese restaurant w an interesting and wide selection of tasty menu options and daily specials; I feel like the restaurant has enough variety that it would be a different experience depending on the company, time of day, and food / drink selection, making it a very versatile choice.  I am definitely curious to experience some of their other menu items!"}
{"text":"I travel for a living and I've had sushi all over the world. This place hands down ranks in my top 3 and that's including Japan! The lunch special are amazing especially the $9 try out plate, which I substituted the California roll for a Philly Roll. All the fish is excellent and extremely fresh! The Gyoza are cooked perfectly which is very hard to find outside of Japan. Lastly the Oysters and incredible and a pretty good wide variety of options too! Came here two days in a row and plan to come every time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Best place. Best service. Love it. Minimum once a week we come here! Skewers are fantastic. 5 dollar sapporo draft. Lovely servers. Nothing better.."}
{"text":"Unique atmosphere, great food. Good price for the quality as well. Would definitely come back again! Order the oshi rolls!"}
{"text":"Love the place and ambiance! I ordered the magic steak, beef tataki, salmon sashimi and everything was spot on! Service was terrific and I love how they give you a choice of chocolate, strawberry, or green tea pocky after the meal! Something different but cool! I'd definitely come back"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for awhile now and I'm glad I finally did! I love this place- it's very cozy, quiet, very good ambiance and of course the food was excellent.  There werent any windows which at first I didn't like but it was okay after we went in. I guess the idea is when you enter you'll feel like you've just entered Japan which I thought they captured.  Our lady server was nice and I like how she didn't have to make small talk and all that. She was attentive of our needs and packed our left overs nice too.  The food was great! Sushi/sashimi all taste the same to me but in here- i found it seems to have more flavor and I don't feel sick after. We only ordered 2 dish but it was more than enough for us. We even got 2 misso soup which we didn't expect! I had to have dessert even though I was already so full so we ended up taking it home!   I recommend this place for your sushi/sashimi fix and craving! The price was awesome too with want you get! I'll definitely go back here to try there bbq grill that starts at 6pm!"}
{"text":"It was my first time here with a friend.  We ordered the grilled broccolini, chef's choice sushi (16 pc), grilled miso black cod, 5 pc Ke set, and some beer.  It was pretty quiet in the restaurant as we got there around 5 and left just after 6 pm.  We were the only table when we got there and there were only two more tables with people when we left.  The service was good without being too intrusive, which some mainstream restaurants can learn from.  The food was of a good quality and well prepared.  Being a bit early, we didn't have the appetite to try more things on the menu.  That was too bad as I would have liked to try their oshi sushi and dessert.  For the two of us, the bill came to just over $100 including tips.  I look forward to trying this place another time."}
{"text":"This is a quality restaurant, and a great addition to Calgary food scene. It has a nice open kitchen concept with a modern touch. We tried several dishes, and liked most of them. The two dishes that particularly stood out were the chicken with herb skewer, and the miso black cod. My partner liked the chicken gizzard skewer. The kimchi sashimi was good too. Service was great as well! I thought the prices were very reasonable for the quality of food. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Magic steak was amazing. One of the best steaks I have ever had. Tempura was great but a little soggy and sashimi was fresh. Love this place"}
{"text":"Very good varied Japanese menu and very reasonable prices. Great friendly service and all items we tried were very tasty and interesting. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The truffle prawn roll is really good. I was disappointed by the portion of asparagus. The shrimp was cooked very well too. I ordered a side of rice and it was tiny for $2.50. Maybe because it was through DoorDash. Overall good food, small portions."}
{"text":"This was our first time here based on a recommendation and the four of us had a fantastic meal, just sorry it took me so long to write this review. This is a great restaurant with a modern take not only on the food but d√©cor and atmosphere.  There are black and white photos around the stairs that leads to the upper floor with a large dining area with extra seating.  The menu is extensive and lots to try including the different varieties of sake.  We got a bottle of the Ume sake and it was delicious.   Food wise, well there's so much to choose from and you can't go wrong with fresh oysters from the East and West coast and you're off to a good start.  They were fresh, served with an assortment of sauces including yuzu and you can't forget Tabasco sauce and a fresh squeeze of lemon.   Next on the menu is an assortment of rolls: mango roll, lobster roll, seared tuna roll and rainbow roll.  All delicious with different texture and flavour combinations and just the right balance of sushi rice, protein and ingredients.  Did I mention it all was fresh?   From the Yakitori menu we had the rib eye on the stone grill, followed by some lambchops, duck, lobster tails and because our eyes are bigger than our stomachs we also ordered the beef ribs.  Needless to say by the time this baby came out we were stuffed so they wrapped it up for us to take home.  It was delicious, so tender full of sauce and garlicky.    Everything was as expected, great service, food, drinks atmosphere and of course we were in good company."}
{"text":"What a fun place go with a large group of people!  I really enjoyed Shokunin and was looking for other Japanese restaurants that serve yakitori.  The yakitori portions were quite large and there's a big selection available on its menu but I found the yakitori to be much tastier at Shokunin.  The sushi was just okay.  Also, the service isn't the greatest.  The staff seemed relatively ill-informed.  For example, there were supposed to be muddled strawberries in my adult beverage, but it came without strawberries and I asked the server whether they brought me the correct drink and they told me there weren't any strawberries in my drink.  It wasn't until I showed them the menu description that they realized there were strawberries but they had ran out.  Little things like that.  It was a fun time but the food wasn't that memorable.  I don't think I'll return."}
{"text":"I have been craving sushi so baldly all day that I dragged my friend with me late last night. The circumstances of going out for sushi were it had to be a place we both had not tried yet.  I remembered this place always looking packed when I would visit other friends the live nearby.  So today was the day.  Snowy out I would be care full walking up to the door I almost went head first in to the door.  Inside was nice and cozy, seemed like a bit of a muddle to get to our table a little bit crowded. I could see why it always seemed like a busy place good bubbly music fun wall art. Was in the mood for rolls not so much the hot plates or bbq but all the food we did have was really good so I may have to come back to try the other stuff."}
{"text":"Although this place is know for grilling, we were looking for other dishes like sushi and noodles and to our surprise everything they had that wasn't grilled was amazing. We had ordered the spicy salmon oshi sushi, mango roll, seafood yaki udon, calamari, and chicken karaage. Everything came out timely and perfect. They service wasn't that great at first but once the food started coming they were very attentive and friendly. I would come back here next time when I'm in Calgary."}
{"text":"Let me start of by saying this is definitely not a $$ joint - think well into $$$ category, as dinner for two ran $80+ without drinks.   This place is fairly new and seemed to be well received so rather than hit up my usual (Nami, What Up), I decided to check it out. It looks like they put a lot of thought into the d√©cor, because the ambiance was spot on - they managed to turn a windowless building into a chic new sushi spot.   Our server was this adorable, bubbly Korean girl who made up for her limited English with her enthusiasm. The menu is an appropriate size, with a little less sushi / maki options that I had imagined - which is fine as long as you do them well. We ordered the Salmon, Spicy salmon, and spicy tuna rolls, as well as the Chef's Choice 10 pc sashimi, a selection of skewers, the miso black cod, and the truffle tempura roll.   First off - let me say, the raving about the miso black cod is absolutely warranted. The fish is so tender, with crispy skin and perfect flavor from the marinade. I mean, it was 10$ for a fairly small piece of fish, but man it was worth it!   The rolls..... have me a little perplexed. they are rectangular, which is fine, and they have fish inside as well as on top, which is really great. However, because they are rectangular the rice to fish ratio is quite high, which takes away from the quality of the roll. I would absolutely love these rolls if the rice layer was much thinner and the fish content was  a bit higher, but as it stands now I'd rather the regular circular rolls.   The Truffle shrimp tempura roll - wow. I usually don't bother with tempura rolls, but this one was topped with salmon and the truffle part intrigued me, and it was delicious! All the right crunch in all the right places.   The chef's choice sashimi was generously cut and fresh - exactly how it should be. the skewers were fun, and pretty tasty, but for the price, I may skip them next time.   This is definitely a fun place, but for $40 a person without drinks, the quality to price ratio puts this at a solid 3 stars. If this was more in the $25-$30 range, I'd be a regular!"}
{"text":"We ordered a bunch of items and everything just tasted okay. There wasn't that much flavour and the service was very slow even though the restaurant wasn't busy.  The yakitori wasn't as good as Shokunin.  We even tried the fresh oysters and even they were just okay. We really wanted to like this place but nothing stood out for us."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time. I must say it's in a weird location.  It wasn't very busy. We opt to sit outside until while waiting for our drinks there was way too many bees in the area to be comfortable. We get our drinks 10mins later, there was 1 server to 4-6 tables so service was a little slow.  The server was very nice. We have Cesar's and they weren't that good. The food presentation is very pretty and someone takes pride in it. All the food is fresh and very tasteful with flavor.  The music was too loud and it was a terrible mix between top 40 and very loud Japanese music.  The vibe was boring, took a length of times for things.   I'd say overall I had an okay experience, the food was great but everything was below average for the price.  For 2 ppl it cost $100 w/tip.   I'll try it again maybe closer to 7-8pm and maybe the vibe and service gets better, we did go at 6pm."}
{"text":"I was very impressed by this sushi place. Great decor and great food. My favourites were the magic steak and the truffle shrimp roll, they were absolutely delicious. I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food. I had two of the oshi sushi offerings- this is pressed sushi and a decent value as each order comprises four pieces. I had the wild salmon, which came with a fantastic spicy miso topping, and a spicy tuna with spicy mayo. Both were stunning. Even more delectable was the chicken karaage, which is made with de-boned chicken leg, not thigh as is more common, and it was just perfect, with a gorgeous spicy mayo on the side. Next to Marra's Way Sushi in Canmore, this is the best chicken karaage I've ever had in Canada outside of Vancouver- I could have eaten four orders of this one, just spectacular. The last and most expensive thing I ordered was the miso black cod from the grilled side of the menu. It was melt in your mouth fantastic with a dollop of Japanese kewpie mayo on the side.  Ke has things not often seen on Japanese menus in Calgary- it's not the bargain of Nami across the street but it's a different sort of experience. I loved every bite of my dinner and as a Bankviewite can see myself coming back here all the time. A blessing after months and months of delays in its opening and, cliched as it sounds, it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"By far the best service and best sushi I've had in Calgary. The staff was super friendly and the food was fast, fresh, and delicious. For a sushi nut, having this restaurant a few blocks away is going to be dangerous."}
{"text":"Our server Ren and the staff here, the ambiance, tea, sushi, grilled meat, fried meat and dessert were all very good here. There's a careful and personalized touch at Ke that is refreshing. Everything was art, from place settings to food presentation.   The meal was served with short explanations of the food, and bites tasted delicious and fresh.   My favourite was miso black cod, but I always order black cod when it's on the menu and it's always good.   The sushi rice was a great texture, fresh, perfectly seasoned so the sushi was enjoyable. The sushi here is pressed into rectangles using a mold. We did think the sushi was heavy on the rice though, not a lot of fish.    The kimchi sashimi was delicious, glad we tried that. The nachos weren't as great as they sounded on the menu, like something you'd get from Kinjo's, wouldn't recommend those. Overall, great solid foodie experience."}
{"text":"We came here with 6 japanese foodies and we were all so excited to see Ke open up. Unfortunately it was just ok to us. I think my favourite was the miso black cod (it was cooked just right and very flavourful). The staff told us the chicken karaage was a specialty of theirs, but it tasted a bit bland to us (it felt as if they were trying to imitate taiwanese salty peppery chicken and not necessarily japanese chicken karaage). We also ordered the saba and spicy salmon oshi sushi. Unfortunately, the rice was dry and the amount of rice was just too much for these pressed sushi. We ended up just taking the rice part out of the oshi sushi, which is sad because i love sushi rice. The magic steak  was a nice piece of beef (given we are in alberta) but it was just beef on a salted hot plate. I would recommend coming here in a group as the portion sizes are small and you should order a bit of each part of the menu to give it a fair try. In the end, I probably won't go back to ke for the sashimi/sushi but if I ever crave black cod, I might contemplate going back."}
{"text":"Great restaurant!!  I was waiting for this place to open with eager anticipation as their exterior looked like they paid attention to detail.  I took my wife and a group of friends here to celebrate her birthday dinner this past weekend.  Lively place, very attentive staff, GREAT and very reasonably priced gourmet food.  The interior was very nicely designed, with an open kitchen and an overall great atmosphere.  The staff are all dressed in yellow hats with rugby like jerseys complete with player numbers, representing their restaurant team.  The gentleman at the back with the red hat is Terry Ke, who I presume is the owner and head chef.  Aside from our regular server, the manager (Rey) spent time to introduce us to the restaurant and the menu, which sake to pair with which dishes and just took a lot of extra good care of us.  We had a group of 6 with one vegetarian so she hand picked our entire dinner, which included a wide assortment of deliciousness including charcoal grilled and seafood/sushi/sashimi.  She picked perfectly, not too little and not too much.  They also sent over a complimentary dish for us to enjoy.  I wish I remembered everything that we ordered, to better describe everything we had in this review.  However, all of the food were superb, as was the level of service and attention from their team.  Everyone in our group remarked that they will be back, to this excellent restaurant."}
{"text":"We like to order food delivered. Ke has been near the top of our list for quality Japanese food. Unfortunately, today's delivery order had us crossing them off our list for good. Either we got the \"B\" team chef, or they've changed management, because the food was incredibly bland. The noodle dish we ordered and the gyoza, were essentially flavorless. Nothing had the bold flavors we'd come to associate with Ke. The sashimi, while you could call it generous, was also not perfectly fresh, and was cut so big it was very hard to eat.  The tempura was packed thoughtlessly, so it arrived limp and unappetizing. Who doesn't know that you can't package a crispy dish in a tightly sealed plastic container -- all it does is steam itself soggy!   If you want authentic Japanese food with bright and succulent flavors, Ke is no longer the place to eat."}
