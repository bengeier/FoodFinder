{"text":"There is nothing i liked about this place at all, I came here because it was close by and had good reviews, however I am not sure why it does. I shared  four sushi rolls with my sister and only sort of liked one of them. One had so much mayo on it I felt like I was just putting a spoonful of mayo in my mouth (I think it was called the super spicy roll.) It is also a very tiny place. Tables are so close together it makes it uncomfortable to talk to the person you are dining with... also it took a very long time to get our food soooo yeah I would not go back!"}
{"text":"Nothing to go nuts about. Sushi was average. Environment is subpar. Service was uncomfortable. They speak quietly and don't greet you at the door."}
{"text":"Outstanding sushi and exemplary customer service!  I only wish I lived closer!  
I was visiting from out of town and was searching for sushi on my way to the airport.  I looked at the Yelp reviews and knew I had to make NZ Cafe a stop on my itinerary.  The sushi was amazing! The Wasabi Salmon Roll was one of the best I have ever had.  But the customer service really impressed me.  I lost my receipt and a week later called to get a copy.  The person who answered the phone took the time to search through their records to find it for me.  She was going to fax it to me, but their fax could not dial a long distance number, so the owner faxed it to me from her home fax at 1:30 AM that night when she got home.  I don't know many restaurants who would put that kind of effort into helping a one-time customer.  However, if I ever am back in Charlotte, I will be going back!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place. We come here when we want good sushi. My favorite will forever be spicy salmon but they have several great rolls. 

The place is small and can get super crowded but it's worth it. The staff is really nice as well."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. Great hole in the wall restaurant for sushi or any other Asian fusion dish. Best sushi in town and also best value, very afordable. Get there early as it has a small dining room and there are always lines out the door. Staff and owners are also great people and very friendly."}
{"text":"I finally made my first trip to New Zealand Cafe to find out what all the fuss is about and dang if you kids weren't lying.

We made it there just in time on a Sunday evening so that we didn't have to wait for a table and started things off with some edamame and a couple sushi rolls.  The edamame was extra salty (just how I like it) and the sushi was delish!

I ordered the Trio Special as an entree (I think that was the name).  It consisted of chicken, beef and shrimp in a spicy brown sauce along with your choice of brown rice or garlic noodles.  It is served with a small salad, with what seem to be a watered down shrimp sauce as the dressing, two crab ragoons, and two small chicken skewers.  All for $6.95, are you kidding me?

The service was excellent I considered deducting a star because the place is so small, but hey, I like it like that.  I had a to go box that did not survive very long and as others have mentioned the leftovers were awesome!  I definately recommend you check this place out and you can get out real cheap if you skip the apps/sushi/alcohol."}
{"text":"I'd just like to say as a born and bred New Zealander the only thing NZ about the place is the sign and some wine. I'd understand if this was listed under pacific fusion but after looking at the menu the name makes little sense apart from perhaps capitalizing off our image..."}
{"text":"If you are tired of trying to find the best Sushi in town, this is it. If your friends or family say different just stick to your guns on this wonderful jewel of a place. The best Sushi I've ever had, bar none!!! If you're not sure of what you'd like ask for Kathy and describe what texture and taste, she or her husband will nail it!!!
Everything is wonderful, been going here for over 10 years, nothing compares.
I hate to tell you about it because it's already busy without you!!!"}
{"text":"This is a difficult review. 4 star sushi & prices...ZERO for customer service & wait time..not our 1st time here..and every time is at least a 1 hour (don't take reservations) wait (if you're lucky)...tonite tipped the scale to never coming back..EVER!! Front of house was so far out in the weeds! After 40 minute wait time,  was told at least 30-40 min longer still wait time..Great spot that needs a much larger space for eat-in customers..judging by wait time for eat-in & volume of take out, they could easily support a larger place..sorry New Zealand, we are done with you"}
{"text":"Great sushi! I had an issue with an entr√©e I ordered but management took care of the issue and removed the order from my bill. 

Giving 4-stars only because my waitress was very nonchalant and had an issue with MY dissatisfaction with my meal. I only wanted what I ordered. 

Just hope her day got better. Will more than likely come back if I'm on this side of town but won't make an effort to travel across town again."}
{"text":"Love this place. awesome sushi for great prices. I've been ordering from here for years and it's still one of my favorite place to go out to"}
{"text":"Always friendly service and very good food. Good size portions and great quality!  Try the bento box...you won't leave hungry.  Great sushi and intimate atmosphere.   A must dine at in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Oh.my.God.

I've had this place bookmarked for almost a year, and when visiting family wanted sushi last weekend, I thought it would be a good time to try it out.  When we pulled up we were all very skeptical - it is not much to look at from the outside.  

Well, it was incredible.  Best sushi in Charlotte, no argument.  The two rolls I ordered -- the Big Boss (I think) and the Shrimp and Crab (I think - I can't remember) were perfection.  It is 100% worth the trek out there if you do not live nearby. Service was great even though they were slammed.  It didn't bother me too much, but you should know that many of the printed menus contain different items - so take a look at the 100 menus they give you.

I cannot WAIT to go back and I'm hoping it becomes a weekly tradition (or hopefully more often!)"}
{"text":"We have been visiting New Zealand Cafe since it opened.  Sad that I am so late reviewing it.  What can I say about this place?  It is one of the top sushi restaurants in Charlotte.  It looks so unassuming from the outside in a strip-mall but boy does this place deliver!  It is small so if you get there right in the lunch or dinner crush, be prepared to wait...awhile.  We have waited for up to 1.5hrs and it was totally worth it.  We try to get there early.  The food quality is superb and the menu is extensive.  Plenty of options for the sushi fanatic.  Our kids started on Kani years ago and have graduated to more exotic and spicier rolls.  Of course they still love Kani lol.  Very high quality for reasonable prices.  Chef and his wife are super people too."}
{"text":"I love this place. The BEST SUSHI IN MATTHEWS! They are very far price for their food and they have a really friendly staff . I would eat here everyday if I could."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Very good value for the money. Sushi as fresh as can be and the meal trays can't be beat."}
{"text":"My wife and I love coming here for dinner. We moved to a new house nearby and learned about New Zealand Cafe from the previous owner. The sushi rolls have always been terrific and the service is friendly. Don't be put off by the low key setting, you won't be disappointed. Though I've never had to wait when I've come here, I suppose it can get pretty crowded at peak times."}
{"text":"Hands down the best sushi place in town! And you wouldn't even believe that when you see the place, but its super yummy. 

I love all their sushi rolls! The prices are well price, quality is good, sushi is good and you will not leave being disappointed if you are a sushi lover!

The only downfall is that this place is so tiny, it only holds about 40 people. So if you go during dinner time there is usually a 20-60 minute wait. I like to go during lunch hour or before the dinner rush. But there has been time where I've waited for over an hour to get a seat. 

Recommended Sushi Rolls: 

Sweet Dragon Roll
Crunch Max Roll
Caterpillar Roll 
Spider Roll
Dragon Roll"}
{"text":"LOVE THE SUSHI...its always fresh and delicious....the only thing i hate its how small and over crowded always busy it is....if ur Starving...DO NOT go eat here.... bc u will most likely have to wait...other than that....its great!!!"}
{"text":"Great sushi at a fair price. Every pay day i drop in here for a delicious meal."}
{"text":"These people are very friendly and accommodating. The sushi is amazing. We get a lot of to go orders for a large group and they are always helpful and accurate on all our orders. This is definitely one of my favorite spots."}
{"text":"I came here with my wife and kids.  Upon arriving around 7:30 noticed there were a lot of people outside.  The wait was about 40 minutes and for a Friday night not bad.  With that said this place is worth the wait.  Service was excellent and the food was great.  I even got sushi to go.  My kids 4, 11, and 13 loved it.  The price is also a plus.  I would definitely recommend this place.  We will definitely be back to try some mire great sushi!!"}
{"text":"Sushis ok our server was really nice but we didn't like the caterpillar roll and we told her we felt really bad but we just didn't like it and we wanted to order something else our server was super nice about it and said she was just gonna let the manager know when the manager came up to she asked what was wrong and we told her that we just didn't like it and it wasn't what we were expecting and that we were sorry and she told us very Rudely that next time we should just get a piece  to try and not do that again and she was very angry and rude and when  we told her we would like to see the menu to get other stuff she rolled her eyes at us and angrily walked away and told our server to get us menus, after being treated like that from her I just wanted to leave don't think I'll be coming back and I hope she fixes her attitude !"}
{"text":"One of the best kept secrets in the Charlotte area for sushi! My favorite roll is the crunchy spicy tuna roll, but everything I've tried has been good. The restaurant is a little small, so get there early to avoid a wait. Amazing sushi for the price."}
{"text":"Great place with great service and sushi! Everything was very fresh and for very reasonable prices. I spent $56 on tons of food for 2 people that I would have spent double in most sushi restaurants. The place must have a lot of return customers bc the owners and staff greet many by their first name. I highly recommend this place and when I visit SC again, I will definitely make another stop here!"}
{"text":"Overall the place is fairly good.
The prices are reasonable (probably due to cheap rent) and the portions decent.

BUT, 4 stars is generous considering it was pretty dirty... the bathrooms, the sushi station, uniforms, procedures, etc.  And that's a big dinning turn-off, especially for sushi.  Also, maybe it was just the setting, but the fish tasted like a lower grade than other places I like around town."}
{"text":"its been all said already ,what are yo u waiting for, you want some good sushi or not. took one star off for the small seating area, foods is great tho, go go go"}
{"text":"This place is horrible. Horrible food. Horrible service. I have come here twice because this place has such great reviews and both times have walked away confused because I have no clue what people like about this place. I guess see for yourself. I mean, after all some people love olive garden and that lobster place. This seems like the sushi equivalent."}
{"text":"Another one of my favorite places to dine. Everything is delicious, from the Kami Nigiri to the Teriyaki Chicken Bento Box. I highly recommend eating here. Even when it's busy, service is still satisfactory."}
{"text":"Why am I just now finding this place?  We arrived early on a Saturday night thinking we'd for sure beat any crowd if a crowd was going to exist in the first place.  The only seats available were at the sushi bar - this little place was packed!  I later decided this was the best possible seat in the house because you get to see everything Jackie and his buddies are slicing up and ask all sorts of questions.

A ton of food.  High quality sushi.  Great service.  Cheap - Really cheap. We had a squid salad, 2 specialty rolls, a chicken and shrimp hibachi platter, and adult beverages....total charge was in the low $30s.

Can't wait to go back.  Even if it's for carry-out.  Diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"New Zealand offers the absolute best sushi in Charlotte hands down! There's not a lot of seating so expect a LONG wait if you want to dine in. They don't take reservations and that hasn't hurt them.  New Zealand is definitely one of Charlotte's hidden treasures.  Plus...show them your driver's license on your birthday and your meal us on the house!!"}
{"text":"First time dining here. My wife and I were both impressed with the freshness of everything we ordered. Quick and polite service. They sure keep this small place packed. I was also impressed that there was a continuous flow of people picking up takeout. We will definitely dine here again. oh!  I almost forgot; the prices are very reasonable!  Sushi dinner for two with soup and salad for under $50!"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi place in Charlotte. Man! It is a bit expensive but it it totally worth it. Close your eyes and randomly pick an item, you cannot go wrong.

Service was great. You feel like family when you come in. You can tell they truly appreciate your business.

It's only flaw, it's located in a strip mall and is very small. Seating is limited and the wait can be long depending on when get there. 

You can never go wrong with takeout."}
{"text":"The sushi here. Omg. Me and my hubby made our first trip here around 8pm they were super packed... We waited outside for about 20 minutes. Once seated we were immediately handed our menus and took our order fairly quickly. The inside is small and cramped and loud... That being said the food was AMAZING!!!! My boyfriend, and avid sushi lover said they had the best sushi he has had in Charlotte. I enjoyed their lobster roll, the ingredients were fresh, the food well made and presented beautifully. Not a great place if your in a hurry or dislike crowds, but for good food at good prices, it can't be beat."}
{"text":"The name, New Zealand Cafe, is quite misleading. We've never been to New Zealand (the country), and are not at all familiar with its cuisine. We also would not consider it a \"cafe\" per se. Overlook the name and get yourself to New Zealand Cafe at your very first opportunity. A very pleasant surprise awaits you. This is a real deal Japanese establishment. The centerpiece, at least for us, is the sushi bar although table seating is available along with an array of traditional non-sushi menu offerings. We go there for sushi alone, at the sushi bar, and have yet to take a table. I must mention that the sushi bar only seats 5, so you may have to wait during peak periods. Believe me, the wait will be totally worth it. If you are rushed or impatient, fret not, all sushi bar offerings are also served table-side.

Jackie, the owner and Chief Itamae, is an incredibly warm and engaging person. He's also very focused and most passionate about his establishment and delivers outstanding sushi, from his hands to your palate. His assistants are trained by him and he keeps a gentle watch over them, ensuring that we, his patrons, receive top quality at all times. We've been there in his absence, and the quality doesn't falter. His persona, however, is missed on those rare occasions.

We typically order a diverse variety of sushi and sashimi, so much so that it's served to us in a large wooden \"boat\" - an artfully tasteful and traditional Japanese presentation that never fails to garner the awe of fellow patrons. Our favorites include: Toro, Mackerel, Yellowtail, Albacore, Scallops (both regular and spicy), Uni with optional Quail Egg, Flying Fish Row with optional Quail Egg, Eel, and Baby Octopus. As starters for us, the Calamari Tempura, Spicy Tuna Roll, Crab and Shrimp Roll, Salmon Skin Roll and Tuna Tartare are all excellent.

I've eaten sushi around the globe regularly for 40 years, know it well, and can attest without reservation that New Zealand Cafe offers the very best sushi in Charlotte, NC. Just take a look at the numerous awards and proclamations proudly displayed on the wall behind the sushi bar.

What are you waiting for??? Go there, NOW!!!"}
{"text":"This place was okay. Sushi was basic - not bad but not the greatest. Service wasn't so great. The waitress was rude. We waited a while for the food. Wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"4 specialty rolls and 2 nigiri. $40 well spent. Don't be worried that their online menu only has like 15 rolls on it. Inside you are given 3 different sushi menus, all with tons of options. Favorites were the Volcano and Wasabi Tuna. Cheap, quality sushi!"}
{"text":"This is probably some of the best sushi I have ever had. Fresh, incredibly flavorful.  There is usually a wait, but as soon as you get the food, it makes up for it. If you are looking for authentic Japanese food, you NEED to come here!!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best sushi places in the area!! This place is hidden in the south east part of Charlotte and very underestimated. Fresh, quick and cheap."}
{"text":"I took a chance trying this place but I heard some people say that's the only place they'll eat sushi.  I had 2 pieces of sushi and they were very fresh but I was saving room for an entree.  They have a great selection of food and I was very impressed at the taste, presentation and quantity of food.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This was a little bit out of the way for me, but it was worth the drive. It's a cute little place, and I mean little--it probably seats 40 if all the tables are full. If there is a wait you have to stand outside, which is not so great on a chilly night. Despite the small size and large number of people waiting for tables, it only took about 10 minutes for us to get a table. This might have been because we were just 2, but they do seem to turn over tables efficiently.

In terms of food, the sushi was fantastic and reasonably priced. They have a tempura vegetable roll, which is a welcome change to the \"typical\" veggie sushi rolls that involve some combination of avocado, cucumber, asparagus, and carrots. They also have fried tofu nigiri, which is one of my favorites. The rest of the menu isn't super vegetarian-friendly, but there are a couple of options.

I will definitely be visiting again!"}
{"text":"Undoubtedly the best sushi around at an incredible price.  Best service in town . Small place & excellent food means they are busy.   Always a wait between 6:49 and 8:30...but well worth it."}
{"text":"Love love love love NZ Cafe. The best sushi I have had anywhere in Charlotte. I agree with those who say it towers above the rest. I've never had an experience where I felt any of my raw fish was less than perfectly fresh---- even on a Sunday, where the fish couldn't have been delivered that same day. My husband is a chef so we never get to go out Fri or Sat and I've learned that going out on a Sunday or a Monday is the true test of the quality of a restaurant. 

As for the \"complaints\" on the wait times and size of the restaurant I have seen on here-- that's part of the deal when you go out to eat! When something is good people take notice and sometimes, yes you have to wait for a table! 

I can't believe anyone reviewing NZ would write anything bad about the staff, as I have always felt them to be extremely friendly, attentive, knowledgeable, and generally a well-oiled team. People who do not work in the food service industry conveniently are unaware of the fact that restaurant staff usually have many things on their mental to-do list at one time and many hungry people to make happy and run around trying to remember everything and keep their heads above water when they are
 busy. That may have been a run on sentence but I wanted to make my point.

As for what I order our guilty pleasure is the Favorite Roll. Totally gringo but I don't care it's that delicious. Could go on and on about all the great rolls we've had there, as well as nigiri, and their cooked entrees as well. Looking forward to going back tonight."}
{"text":"Have brought friends and family here and they all agree that New Zealand is the best in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Everything is good. There is plenty on the menu for someone that doesn't like sushi. The sushi is the best I've had in Charlotte though. Always fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"AMAZING SUSHI!!!! Wonderful service! Only issue is, don't come super hungry because you will have to wait on a weekend as it is VERY busy. But it's only that busy because the sushi is so wonderful and so cheap!"}
{"text":"What a find this place is! Very good-toexcellent quality sushi. The Chinese/Asian dishes are very good quality, tasty and cheap! Most of their dinner entrees are under $10. Seriously, this place is wonderful, I highly recommend trying it out.

P.S. Place is small so you may wait, but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in town. Hands down. Just saying. =)

But no, seriously, for the price, you couldn't do better! People go for atmosphere these days rather than the quality of food and getting your money's worth. This is the place to be if you actually want good sushi!"}
{"text":"I love you, New Zealand Cafe. Wanna make a sushi baby with you. Don't go anywhere else in/around Matthews for sushi. Or else..."}
{"text":"Nothing to see here!  Move along, move along!!

(to my chagrin, this is a well-kept secret no longer....)


Very fresh, affordable sushi.  Tiny location in a strip mall, seating is very limited.  Best sushi option in the Matthews/SE CLT area, by far.

If you are doing take out, give yourself plenty of time -- they can get backed up, especially on the weekends."}
{"text":"I stopped by this place with my daughter and this roll was amazing!!!even though the line was very long it was worth it!!! Highly recommend !!!"}
{"text":"New Zealand Cafe is a neighborhood favorite. Menu is large and varied. Dishes are beautifully prepared.  Get there early as there is usually a line"}
{"text":"Awesome sushi great service   Never disappointed when I eat at New Zealand Cafe!!  Hidden amongst the Chain restaurants that litter the Charlotte landscape."}
{"text":"Food was just okay. Service was horrendous!  Waitress seemed to be hiding in the back.  We got there at 1pm on a weekday and didn't get out until 3pm. And the place wasn't that crowded. After waiting an hour, they got my order wrong."}
{"text":"Best sushi place in the Charlotte area! Only issue I have is the environment. Cheesy string lights, fake dusty plants and a cramped area make it less appealing. But, the sushi is soooo good. Crispy Eel roll is the BEST!"}
{"text":"When we arrived to the location, he said, OH OH, this is not going to be good, the outside look does not invite you to go inside, but this place was highly recomend for a friend, that we said, well let's try... Inside it looks much better...

The attention was really good, the ladies were really nice and check on us all the time.

The food, well, GREAT  food!! Fresh and tasty!!!! I highly recomend this place for a great sushi experience. I did not give 5 star because it took a while for them to bring our food."}
{"text":"I have been dining there for many years and even if I go 6 months between visits, they still remember my first name. I LOVE their sushi! It might be a small restaurant but it's got a big heart. Great food and service."}
{"text":"No doubt best sushi in town..Jackie rocks."}
{"text":"Worst sashimi I've had in Charlotte.  

I imagine this place has such high reviews because people get rolls with fried shit and spicy mayo all over it... so, of course it tastes good and masks not-fresh fish.

I had a sashimi platter and a bunch of nigiri a la carte.  It was all bad.  Some of the fish tasted frozen/half-thawed out, some of it tasted like it was soaking in water... watery sashimi? I don't know, that was a first for me, too.

My friend loved his salmon skin hand rolls, but I declined to try some because I was so over it."}
{"text":"I was one of those \"I hate sushi people.  Until I was forced to eat at new Zealand.  Delicious. I recommend take out because the restaurant is always packed"}
{"text":"I was very surprised by this place. It had a great selection of food and it was delicious. I will definitely be going back. Also, try the fried banana. I'm not usually a fan of fried bananas but my girlfriend made me get it and I'm glad I did."}
{"text":"Our favorite sushi place, despite the long commute (30+min on 485). Great variety of rolls and nigiri/sashimi. They have delicious uni which is a huge plus for us. We like the casual environment this place offers.

One of the waitresses knows us so well, the first thing she will ask us is if we'd like to put in our order for the Fantasy Shrimp bento and to give us a pen knowing we always order about 20 pieces of random fresh nigiris and sashimis. They take care of you here, if you give them a chance.

Our only complaint is that the place is tiny which means there can be a bit of a wait for seating and your food, but it hasn't stopped us from coming back. This place isn't for everyone, and we are OK with that. :)"}
{"text":"with all of the great reviews, I was hoping for so much more.  
There are better places near uptown Charlotte and surrounding neighborhoods. I found the sushi average at best."}
{"text":"I love this place. I feel that if they expanded, it just wouldnt be the same, I think the atmosphere is conducive to its size, and having a small wait at the door is perfect for this small little joint.
The sushi i ordered, Spicy Tuna Maki, Eel Dragon, Fire Cracker Roll and Shrimp Tempura roll, 4 orders total, came out on a giant boat, which made me feel like a pig, but after the first bites of each roll, I wasnt caring what anyone else was thinking. Service was friendly and attentive, and we got everything we ordered, and fast. This is s great spot. I look forward to doing it again soon!"}
{"text":"The service has gone down hill tremendously. We waited an hour for our food while everyone around us got their food. We were offered no apology at all and were never told that we would be waiting for a long period of time. Also, I am vegan and ordered vegetable sushi and it came with smelt Roe all over the rice due to lack of care. They brought out a replacement, but between that and the wait I was not pleased. The last four times I've been there my experiences have been similar and poor. It is sad because this used to be my favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"NZ Cafe is easily my favorite sushi spot in the area. I can't believe I haven't reviewed it before. Today's selection was a Rainbow Roll & saba. My daughter had the Queenstown Chicken with garlic noodles. We both ate every bite. NZ Cafe is consistently delicious & affordable. The service is always top notch."}
{"text":"I am very conservative on accolades on yelp.  Charlotte is devoid of a selection and variety of restaurants but this place is an absolute gem.  We drive 45 minutes across town to eat here.  Prices are fair, service is good, the sushi is excellent.  Presentation is great, the rice is perfect, and the portions are abot 20-30% more than anywhere in town.  Try the Ichiban roll!  Went on monday night at 7:00 and place was full, but only waited 5 minutes for table.  The dining room is small and a bit tight, but the food makes up for lack of elbow room."}
{"text":"The sushi here is absolutely delicious.  Never have I craved sushi until I ate here.  The service is slow compared to other restaurants but I suspect that is because of the quality of food you are receiving.  The Firecracker Roll is BY FAR one of the best things I have ever eaten.  The Dynamite Roll is very good.  The Hamachi Nigiri (farmed yellowtail) was delicate and delicious.  Their Unagi Nigiri is amazing.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The best value for sushi in CLT. Hesitant to write this review as if word spreads about this place, will never be able to get a table.  It is very small and just a shade above \"hole in the wall\" category.

The only place that rivals this is Enso, but prices there are 2-3x higher."}
{"text":"If you're reading this, stop it and just don't hesitate any longer to come to this place... what a deliocious sushi, it was worth the wait no kidding."}
{"text":"The best sushi in Charlotte, the best I have ever had, and it is not close.

I have been going to NZ Cafe for 5 years or more and it is great every ... single ...time.  I have tried many of the rools, but live the tuna avocado and spicy tuna rolls.  I go with soy paper over seaweed and that's easily done here.  Service is great and prices are CHEAP!  

I was a giant fan of Ru San in Dilworth for years.  Then Ru San picked up a poor score on the sanitary scale and that was the end of it for me.  NZ is always at \"A\", kinda critical for a sushi place (with a C, sushi becomes bait)."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place. This is our go to sushi place in Charlotte. The wait is always long but it is well worth it. I keep telling everyone I k ow about New Zealand and how amazing the sushi Rolls are. If you want great sushi come here. Best place in Charlotte in my opinion."}
{"text":"I just moved to the area and really, really, really wanted to like NZ Cafe. Based on the Yelp reviews, the typical lines and the fact I really wanted a good sushi place within a mile from where I live. So much so that I even went twice.

I should note I have only had the sushi, and I try to stick with sashimi and rolls without fried anything and I stay away from the entire fried rolls. Maybe their other stuff is better. I did like their bamboo roll, which is basically just fish wrapped in cucumber in a little ponzu sauce. Their eel isn't bad.

Everything else? Completely average at best. The rolls are way too large and have way too much rice. I popped the avocado off of a roll only to see a pencil-sized bit of filling in the middle of a giant wad of rice.

The fish seemed to be a bit fresher than average but I struggled to eat it or taste it around way too much rice. Some of the rolls are just bad. I couldn't manage to eat a grilled tuna roll.

I'd give the food about three stars (average), but the super-cramped space and the lines (why are there lines?) drop it down to about two stars. I'm regrettably driving farther for sushi now."}
{"text":"GO THERE! is all I can say! The food is delicious! I had it on Tuesday night and I am going back tonight to have this yummy yummy yummy food. I even had leftovers from Tuesday night and ate it as breakfast the next morning. I swear it tasted better, lol. Customer service is wonderful, although the place is a bit cramped... you can tell its becoming popular. I wont be surprised if they need a new location. I am so happy to have found a new place to eat out at, and close to home!!"}
{"text":"Long wait, but the fried oyster roll is so worth it!!!!!! The best sushi in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Still our favorite Sushi in town, have not been here for months just revisted twice in last month. Treated a friend from Raleigh this last visit. They were very impressed. We did have a wait, arrived during the busiest part of evening but well worth it."}
{"text":"Really great place. It's small so you'll probably have to wait to get a table during busy times, but that's really the only negative. The food is terrific, especially for the price. And this is the restaurant that convinced me that I like sushi. I've had sushi at several other places since but none of it is quite as good as what you'll get here. Recommend all the way."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here last night with another couple....this might now be my favorite sushi in Charlotte!! It's a hole in the wall sushi place within a strip mall. 

We split 7 rolls between the 4 of us and it was a TON of food. They even brought it out in a boat (ok, ok, we requested the boat because eating a ton of sushi out of a boat is just so much cooler than on a plate!!). We ordered the cilantro roll, valentine roll, dynamite roll, sweet dragon roll, wasabi roll, christmas roll, and volcano roll. All were absolutely delish! My favorites were the cilantro roll (just super refreshing and light....loved the lemon on top) and the valentine roll (soy paper and shaped like a heart!) No man was left behind on our boat!

Prices were very good. I think the final bill was a little under $40 a couple for all those rolls.

Just a note, this place is very very small. So, I would come early or later to avoid waiting for a table. We live in Uptown, so it is a hike to get to New Zealand. However, I think it'll be worth the drive when my next sushi craving comes around!"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff. There is limited seating (I sat directly next to where customers paid - they would sometimes lean next to my plate), thus the 4 stars. The food was worth it, though!"}
{"text":"Dont let the Dumb name fool you, this is a good sushi place with no \"New Zealand\" food or flair. It is a small little place with some good fresh sushi! This is the first place in Charlotte that I have actually really liked their food, as far as sushi goes that is. When you do go there, know that you will be sitting very close to other patrons and will be able to hear what everyone is talking about in the restaurant. The staff is very friendly and accommodating towards odd orders which is nice. The Spicy Mayo is very Mayoie or however you spell that word. Go there on your Birthday and you will get a free meal, 21 and over and make sure you bring your ID. I recommend this place as long as your in the area. I will be going back!"}
{"text":"Excellent choice for amazing sushi, excellent prices.
Went in Tuesday night and the place was packed.
Great prices."}
{"text":"New Zealand cafe is delicious, but Geez... it's time to expand your restaurant... it's SOO cramped in there. Just waiting for a to go order, they send you to the hallway to sit in a chair so you're out of the way of the servers... but then you end up awkwardly being squeezed past by patrons trying to use the restroom at the other end of the hall"}
{"text":"I've tried almost any and every place in charlotte that sells sushi and New Zealand has everyone of them beat!!! I've been going here for 10+ years now and have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Food was AWESOME and cheaper than I would've believed, with no sacrifice of quality.  I got a salad, an 8 pc roll and a piece of nigiri for just over $8.  The service was... polite and prompt, but rather less pleasant than I usually expect.  That being said, I'll happily overlook the somewhat mechanical service and come back for the food on a regular basis!"}
{"text":"I've only been here twice, but I AM IN LOVE with New Zealand Cafe. This place is tucked away in an nondescript strip mall and I'd say it's a hidden gem for sushi! 

The both times I've been here, we had to wait to be seated because it was busy and it stays busy (rightfully so because the food is so gooood). The restaurant is pretty small, cozy, and always packed with patrons so it takes the sushi chefs some time to get the sushi out. I can't complain though, their sushi is absolutely worth the wait!

I came with a party of 8-10 each time, and everyone just picked an order of sushi of their choice and then we all just dug in and shared. I've probably had 15+ different orders of their sushi and I can't complain about a single one! Their sushi ingredients are fresh and their rice is done right. Not only is their sushi DELISH, it's completely affordable and they're actually a pretty big size. The service has always been wonderful as well, the staff is so friendly and attentive. 

In summary, New Zealand Cafe is hands down one of my favorite sushi joints in Charlotte. I don't want to go anywhere else for sushi! Love this place! I'd eat here every day if I could but I'd rather not see a huge spike of mercury levels in my body."}
{"text":"The food and service used to be good here but now is horrible. I called in an order and was told 40 min and an hour and a half later my food was still not ready. They gave us food that was not ours and then realized they hadn't made our food. Was told we would be given a refund but then only received a refund for one item which was the cheapest. You also have to continuously get bumped into while waiting because there is no room. Until they make changes I will not be back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place in Charlotte! Words can't describe how happy I am that I have discovered this gem of a place. I wish the absolute best for the owners but sometimes, for my own selfish reasons, I hope they don't expand because most restaurants that expand, often don't do things the same. Such as, the chef's are different and the prices increase because of whatever reason... It's just.. This place is perfect and I don't want anything to change. And plus, I don't want any more people to know about this place because this place can get packed real quick. I'm just joking... Sorta.

The sushi here is spectacular and at a reasonable price too. The quality of the sashimi is just incredible and especially for the price. It's a bang for your buck!! And for my non sushi lovers out there, the bento box is great also, really good portions. 

Favorite dishes:
Big Boss Roll
Lobster King Roll
Century Roll
Sake Nigiri
Tuna Tataki 
Poke
Squid Salad
Fried Ice Cream"}
{"text":"I've been here many times and the food is always good. It may be too \"Americanized\" for sushi  aficionados and the decor inside is strange for a Japanese restaurant, but everything I've ever had here has been delicious! It gets very crowded on the weekends so, get there early. I don't see how anyone could give this place less than four stars. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Wow. Delicious! Stopped by randomly and the place was packed on a Sat at 12pm, so you know it has to be good. The wait was long due to it, but expected and well worth it. All sushi rolls were great, soup and lomein were great and they even have a kids menu. Def coming back!"}
{"text":"Average sushi, some creative rolls you won't see anywhere else. But it's SO crowded, we never go during prime dinner hours. And the strangest thing is there always seems to be at least six waiters, but service is always slow. Drink your drinks slowly, and ask for any extras all at the same time."}
{"text":"Maybe the best sushi I've ever had. Rolls & bento boxes were all so good, you really can't go wrong. Not only is the food itself SO GOOD, the price makes it 10x better. My family and I got 4 rolls (2 were the most expensive on the menu), 2 bento boxes, 5 nigiri pieces, & miso soup for $63. We're on vacation for a week and will no doubt be back before we leave. 

If you're looking for sushi, absolutely go here. It's a small place but it is absolutely worth the short wait to get in."}
{"text":"Great choices and reasonably priced- What more can I ask for! I will keep going back for my sushi 'fix'! Loved their salmon skin roll. Unagi!"}
{"text":"I have been on the hunt for good sushi places since I moved to Charlotte from AZ / SoCal. This is my all time favorite place. As close to west coast sushi as you can get and some of the rolls are better then what I get in San Diego. The servers are always nice and I sit at the sushi bar to bs with the sushi chefs. If I could give them more stars I would."}
{"text":"*Ding, Ding, Ding, Ding* I've found a winner! 

Ok, so for the past two days (June 7th & 8th), the hubs and I have been celebrating and partying like we were back in College. It was our 3rd Anniversay and my 27th birthday so we hit up a few places in Charlotte and we were not disappointed. After we checked out of the Sierra Hotel (which I will be reviewing in a lil' bit) the hubs took me to New Zealand Cafe for lunch. It's off North Sardis road in a strip mall type setting.

I was really excited to be having lunch here b/c all the sushi buffs I know have been saying this is the best sushi in Charlotte. AND THEY WEREN'T LIEING! At first glance I didn't know what to make of the decor, it's a hodge-podge of japanese design/nautical elements/viking-esque wall art. But I wasn't here for the decor, I wanted to inhale some SUSHI! We were greeted instantly and told to grab a seat, so we sat near the door as everywhere else was taken. I can't remember the name of our server, but she was very petite and wore a big smile. She took our drink order and handed us three different menus. The hubs told her it was my birthday and with that she smiled and said, \"Oooh you get a free meal today!\" I was estatic, I showed her my DL and she pointed out what I could order for free. I chose the Hibachi Chicken and Shrimp platter, I also ordered a Sweet Dragon Roll and the hubs ordered a Rainbow Roll.

It took about 10 minutes and I was in Sushi heaven...the sweet dragon roll was perfect dipped in my concoction of soy sauce, wasabi and mayo dipping sauce. Now on to the Hibachi Chicken and Shrimp platter that came out in a cute little tray. It was an assortment of crab-n-creme cheese wontons, chicken on a stick, broccoli, onions. zuchini and of course shrimp and chicken. It was sooo good! The sushi was so fresh, you could tell they use the best ingredients. The portion was the perfect size although I could not finish the entire roll but the hubs was on hand to polish off what I couldn't.

All-in-all, New Zealand Cafe gets five stars for it's friendly servers, mom and pop feel and quality sushi! :-)"}
{"text":"Great place and our kids loved it!  Excellent service. Worth the wait, because it is small and crowded."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Charlotte hands down. I've tried almost everywhere in charlotte, this is by far the best place. 
I've been coming here for years."}
{"text":"Best sushi in town for sure. Best I've had in U.S. Calamari to die for. Tuna Poki extra spicy.  Mot on menu but great. Cathy forgets nothing. Jackie is the best.  Eating here for 10 years. At least twice a month."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. Small place and very popular so we traditionally won't go with a party over 4 people. Bento box is the way to go for me. It's very well balanced with your entree, salad, etc. Service is always on point at lunch to keep the tables turning but I've never felt rushed."}
{"text":"New Zealand Cafe is the best sushi place in Charlotte, hands down! Especially for the price. It may be small and not as trendy as Nikkos (which I love as well), but it constantly delivers!"}
{"text":"Wonderful little sushi place...and I do mean little. I had the crab salad and the app with spring rolls, dumplings and shrimp...amazing! Found out my Sister & Bro in-law are regulars. Great food, nice staff...we will be back. I do wish they had a better variety of drinks though. Wine, beer & soft drinks only."}
{"text":"Sashimi Bento Box was good. It could be better but for the cheap price I paid it was worth it. Toro & Ikura nigiri were splendid! The food service was quick! The atmosphere here is great too... Very casual but good. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Only okay. Cheap sushi, garlic noodles were dry and tasted nothing like garlic. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Awful. Both food and ambience.
After a 30 minute wait (that's OK for a good restaurant) we were seated at a small table wedged into a cost efficient row of similar two foot tables literally inches from other diners. No way to avoid their conversation, and that's not what their website photo shows. 
The food was badly timed with my meal, Mayalasia Buttered Shrimp,  coming before we had finished our appetizers. It was dry and unmemorable. My wife's main dish--a large rainbow roll, didn't even arrive until after she remided the waitress and then I had completed my meal and needed to look anywhere but to the side so as to not stare at elbow-buddy fellow diners as my wife completed her forgotten and then delayed dish.

There are many good reviews but unfortunately we found nothing memorable in any positive way."}
{"text":"Place is small but it is GOOD! My new favorite sushi spot!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great sushi, great prices, only warning is you need to get there early as it is not a big space.  Place is always crowded though which should tell you something.  Best sushi I have had in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Our favorite sushi in charlotte! We always order take out because the restaurant is small. We love the crispy California rolls and vegetable tempura roll as well. Can't really go wrong with trying any of their rolls."}
{"text":"Yum! sushi is awesome. A lot of deep fried rolls, which I am not a huge fan of. But we ordered 4 rolls and they were all good. (I'm not sure if it was worth the 45 min wait for a table). They seem to have a quantity over quality mindset, when it comes to seating tables and doing to go orders. The restaurant is tiny though, so arrive early if you want want to go on a weekend."}
{"text":"The service is very slow do to having only one waiter wait on 6 or so tables. The sushi is very good tho so I guess it's worth the wait. We waited about an hour for a table and when we finally got a table we waited another 15 minutes just to order our drinks and food since we looked at the menu outside. Appetizers came around 25 minutes in and the sushi started coming around an hour later. In all the food was great we had grab ragoons and all sorts of sushi from the charlotte roll, philly roll, spicy salmon, wasabi roll and so on we also had the family chicken with veggies and brown rice which was the last thing served to us and 5 minutes later we got the check which was not very pleasing. They took a very long time getting our receipts back which was about 10 minutes. It was a good place for food but if you're in a hurry I don't recommend it."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Charlotte, hands down. The Valentine Roll is my absolute favorite and I order it every time. Even if I don't have time to stop and eat, I order it to go almost every time I'm in the area. They don't take reservations so if you're in a rush, make sure you're really early. The restaurant is TINY but the food is incredible. If you're looking for good sushi with knowledgeable staff that can make recommendations, this is your place!"}
{"text":"Good sushi for good prices! I tried the Dancing eel
Roll & Charlotte roll on different trips here and had fresh flavors both times. I think there are fancier sushi restaurants in town but this place had good flavors & service!  It can get crowded at lunch time. It is in a shopping plaza so look for the sign near Harris Teeter."}
{"text":"This is a very intimate space, with tons of good choices and a great value!"}
{"text":"Wow, just wow. For a hole in the wall restaurant in a strip mall who would've thought you could get this kind of quality sushi?? So the bad...the place is packed and you'll have to wait, once you get seated be prepared to wait some more. This place has a very high demand for take out, I'm assuming via phone orders...so even though they have a full staff making sushi non stop the wait for your food is going to be longer than what most people would be accustomed to. Now, why is this still 5 stars?? Because the quality and price for the sushi is unheard of! Excellent specialty rolls, high quality nigiri and sashimi and all for a very affordable price. Try everything you won't be let down!"}
{"text":"Not over the top amazing like some people are commenting. Not in my opinion at least. And the wait....the sushi is definitely not worth it."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi at an incredibly cheap price!  Having lived in Hawai`i for 9 years this was a pleasant surprise to find in Charlotte.   The Poki (poke for the Hawaiians) is amazing as was every sushi roll we ordered.   

This place is small and PACKED.  The take out orders and queue for being seated are ridiculously large.  Go early (6pm) or plan to wait!  Or, order take out and arrive when it's ready, it'll probably be a better choice than showing up at 7:30pm any evening."}
{"text":"Oh New Zealand, I wanted to like you for so much more than your wine from Marlborough, especially after the drive to find you, but unfortunately a 3 star s all I can commit. The place is small and quaint and deserves the \"cafe\" name. The menu is extensive with pictures (not a fan of pictures food on a menu as a norm) and the prices are CHEAP, which is the best part of the place. 

Had some steamed pot stickers for an appetizer and while good, they could use a bit more flavor. Then ordered 4 rolls, most recommended, and they came out on a funky boat which was cool. They tuna crunchy roll was way too hot and fried for my taste. My favorite roll was the pink roll and would order it again and again. Ichiban and Dynamite roll were good too, though the Ichiban could have used something extra. 

All in all, the price is hard to beat and I will try it again when I'm in the area and try a few different rolls."}
{"text":"We randomly discovered the New Zealand Cafe in this little strip plaza at the corner of Sardis and Monroe and noticed that every time we saw it, it looked quite busy, even during weeknights.  We decided to give it a try one Wednesday evening and understood why.  

They have a pretty extensive Asian menu, including a wide variety of sushi.  We tried a tuna crunch roll to start and I literally could have eaten about 5 or 6 of those for my dinner and been completely satisfied (not to mention very full).  The roll was so full of flavor and only very lightly fried.   Nevertheless, I also ordered one of their hot chicken entrees, the spicy Thai curry chicken, too.  It came in a bento box with the chicken entree, rice, a few fried shrimp, dipping sauces, a salad with ginger dressing, and a crab cheese wonton.  All for under $6.  At dinner.  Wow.  It was VERY delicious and well worth the price.  

What a find the New Zealand Cafe was!  We'll definitely be back for a very reasonably priced, hot, delicious meal.  I can't wait to try more of their sushi and hot entree options!"}
{"text":"This is my \"go to\" restaurant. I eat here at least once per week.  The food is consistently fresh and perfectly prepared.  In over 10 years, I've never had a bad meal here.  The staff is very friendly. I really love this place!!"}
{"text":"We love NZ! The food is always outstanding and the sushi is always fresh and tasty. The prices are reasonable. Hidden gem!"}
{"text":"YES. JUST YES. best sushi evvvveerrrrr. You can get an AMAZING philly role for just $5!!! Small seating so be ready to wait a bit on weekends. Very cool sushi bar that you can sit at!"}
{"text":"Small spot, but they are cranking out some amazing dishes. I am a big fan of sushi. This restaurant has some of the best presentations and rolls in the city. The prices are great and so are the portions. Great food, great value, great service."}
{"text":"This place had great sushi at affordable prices. The fish was fresh and the rice had good texture. The place is small but the service is good.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I was very confused when I first arrived not at all what I was expecting but my friend had been a few times and said it was good so I of course listened and met him there!

First off pretty small and we were lucky to get a table. I recommend to go on a not so busy time (meaning not 7-7:30) 

The food was pretty good we just did an assortment of rolls and some edamame and Pot Stickers. 

I was most impressed by the service they were very attentive and made some really good recommendations"}
{"text":"Hands down, some of the best sushi I've had. I had the Rose Roll and the Discover Roll. My favorite was the Discover. The presentation for all of our sushi (my husband and I ordered 4 rolls between us) was beautiful. I will definitely be back!

Pro tip: This place is small, so I recommend arriving early for lunch or dinner! It gets crowded -and fast!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi places in Charlotte, actually the best in my opinion! The prices are reasonable for sushi and the taste is excellent. We come here often and wait it out since there is always a wait. If you do a pick up make sure to call in at least 30 mins before because it usually isn't ready even when you come in to pick it up. They are usually always packed but it is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Best sushi (and best prices) in the area. This is a must try for anyone wanting sushi in the area. The restaurant itself is TINY, and you will probably have a pretty decent wait for dine-in. We normally do take-out and have always enjoyed"}
{"text":"I've had this place bookmarked forever. So I'm glad I finally got the opportunity to try it. 

We stopped by for dinner, when we arrived there was a 40 minute wait. It was worth it! 

I started with the vegetable spring rolls. They were pipping hot, crispy and delicious. For my meal I ordered the Discover Roll. Oh my goodness. It has all of my favorite things....spicy tuna, crab and avocado topped with spicy mayo! It was so good. It might be my new favorite roll. 

I can't wait to come back. There are so many more things that I'm looking forward to trying!"}
{"text":"Great sushi. Place is small but service is good and prices are right. Huge selection of food options."}
{"text":"I have come to live this place! Sushi fresh and flavorful, affordable price with a cozy atmosphere. I have averaged a visit every week for the past 3-4 weeks."}
{"text":"Adjusted for location, being a sushi snob from Marin county, California, I'll go five stars.  
It is not quite as good as my favorite place back home but better than my second favorite.  
Everyone says it's the best sushi in charlotte and I believe them.   Had an excellent lunch.  Couldnt wait for dinner the night previous because it was packed.  And only reason I got in for lunch was I showed at 1130.  Go early."}
{"text":"After hearing about this place from a friend, and seeing it previously on Yelp, I decided to check it out for lunch today.
Though it was a little cramped, and the service a little scattered, the sushi was very good and reasonably priced.  With so many mediocre (at best) sushi places in CLT, it's nice to find a quality place close to home.  I will def. be back!"}
{"text":"above average to good sushi at compelling prices. Service is....deliberate."}
{"text":"My wife and I have enjoyed dinner here several times and have never been disappointed. The sushi is excellent as well as the rest of the menu. The staff is extremely friendly and they make you feel welcome. The space is small but it doesn't distract from the New Zealand cafe, it adds to it. So go ahead give them a try, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Sushi in Charlotte!  Very reasonably priced for what you get.  Big, fresh, super tasty rolls.  This place is small and you will have to wait- sometime a long time.  I promise it is worth it.  Try the rest of the menu other than sushi- everything is excellent."}
{"text":"Tucked away in a strip mall, this truly is a gem of a place! I'm not what you would call a sushi expert, but absolutely loved the valentine roll, spicy tuna roll and salmon skin roll we'd ordered tonight.

Prices are very reasonable and staff is very friendly. I wish the restaurant was a little more spacious, but thats not a major complaint."}
{"text":"I've been going to New Zealand Cafe since they opened.  (Can anyone remember when it was a Sub Dudes? Yea.. Still amazed at how much of the decor they kept--but I digress.)

New Zealand Cafe makes you think you're going to be eating Kiwi foods, but you're not.  I still don't quite understand the connection in that light but it is what it is.  Now if you're looking for a great and fair priced Bento Box, Sushi, or a spread of menu items that are all quite tasty and again well priced then you are in for a treat.  We've roamed the menu over the last few years and while I often get Sashimi bentos or some collection of Sushi rolls, when I am hungry I'll grab a roll and a entree and still feel like I made out great.

The service is interesting; sometimes we feel like we're coming home--sometimes we feel like we need to wave for a glass of water.  Just go with a bit of room in your flexibility for service.  This also includes patience.  This place has got to be no larger than 800sqft of sitting space which translates into a waiting game if you go any time near dining hours.  We will always go early, or go late, but never go during dinner rush.

If you don't like waiting, and you really need to be doted upon there are many places in Charlotte that will charge you waaaay waaay waaay more for the same quality of food.  I'd rather afford a healthy amount of great food than pay for a store owners overhead.  You're going to have to make that choice.

So if you want some great sushi and bento combos head on over.  Hell you even get a free meal on your birthday--now that rocks."}
{"text":"great food! I order the teriyaki chicken noodles and it's always delicious, their ginger salad is great and I love their rice with shrimp sauce! my hubs gets the queens town chicken. we love this place. it fills up quick and is on the smaller side but it's worth it"}
{"text":"I love New Zealand Cafe... is by far no the best sushi in Charlotte, but is always fresh and good... it is such a great place to visit, that I will stop for a quick bite if I am in the area"}
{"text":"First went there asked hostess if they we're busy and had a table available she said no they were not and yes there was tables available I told her I was waiting for someone she said okay and nothing else the person came less than three minutes later we walk into sit down mind you I have a baby and a toddler she says oh we don't have any tables available it's going to be a 30 to 40 minute wait she said someone just walked in   why didn't you take my name and hold the table when I walked in there!  okay besides that we decided to eat outside so we only had to wait 10 to 15 minutes we got our food it was okay not excellent not bad so we get home about two hours later I get the worst stomach pains and cramps I'm pretty sure I got food poisoning I was in the bathroom most of the night my husband who also ate chicken also had extreme pains and was in the bathroom most of the night my daughter didn't eat chicken she had sushi when she woke up in the morning she was vomiting we did not all eat the same things but we all had pretty much the same symptoms of food poisoning I only had breakfast that morning so it was nothing else that I ate and I had a bowl of cereal my husband was at work and my daughter ate her lunch at school that I packed for her so 100% positive it was the New Zealand Cafe just glad that the baby didn't eat there. He was the only one not sick. honestly I just don't think that they handle their food sanitarily probably cross-contamination with fish chicken not cooking things properly or just plain dirty or not keeping things at a proper temperature. If you have a sensitive stomach I suggest you don't eat there and find a cleaner nicer not so cramped seafood place"}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi. I've only been there one but very solid. Really good service.its one of the best places in the area"}
{"text":"This is the best place for sushi in Charlotte... there is no room for argument... this is a fact. I live about a quarter mile from New Zealand Cafe, but I didn't know about it until a coworker of mine recommended it. It took me a couple of weeks to actually make it over there, but once I did I was hooked! I have been there 3x so far. It can get really crowded for dine in, so be sure to expect a wait.. a wait well worth it. Carry-out is also an option I have done a few times.

The sashimi bento box was delicious. The fish is very fresh and they roll the sushi right in front of you. They have $1 nigiri which is phenomenal and very high quality. The prices here are cheaper then most places and the sushi is better tasting and higher quality. My favorite rolls are the spicy tuna and the tempura rolls. I have a lot more to try! 

5 stars"}
{"text":"Great service! Plenty of choices. I wouldn't say five star sushi quality. However, the price and variety make it completely worth it!"}
{"text":"I've only gotten sushi and some apps here. Definitely one of my favorite sushi places. Knocked off a star because there is always a wait. This place is tiny but worth it."}
{"text":"After completing my first dining experience at New Zealand Cafe, it's no wonder this place is so highly rated and raved about. It look's a little dive-y / hole-in-wall from the outside, but inside this place is a real gem. 

I opted to go with the bento box so I could get a little taste of everything. The hibachi chicken box ($12.99) came with chicken hibachi, white rice, a California sushi roll, ginger salad, 2 pcs shrimp tempura, and a few tempura battered/fried veggies. What a steal!

The chicken hibachi was full of flavor and veggies. The sushi was fresh & the ginger salad had a great taste. The other sushi I saw coming out of the kitchen looked awesome, so I'll definitely give that a try next time. A real sushi gem the Sardis area."}
{"text":"My coworker recommend this place. She was right! It's the best sushi that I have ever had."}
{"text":"Love love love the food!  It's the BEST! But I really get claustrophobic in such a tight and always crowded place. I hang in though because their sushi us incredible especially for the price."}
{"text":"Best sushi in town!!!!! I almost didn't post this review bc I love it so much, I don't want it to get any busier. But it's totally worth the wait. Great food, awesome service.  Definitely try the hot and sour soup if you like spicy. You can't go wrong with the sushi- it's all delicious."}
{"text":"I'm a regular at this place because of it great sushi rolls and onion soup. The other evening on my visit my spring roll was cold when u bit into it. I didn't cause a commotion just requested another one. The owner gets a attitude because I sent it back. She took it upon herself to be a waitress for the remainder of the evening. OMG the service was dry, we were RUSHED and she didn't apologize nor said thank you after returning with my receipt. I don't think I'll be returning..."}
{"text":"Nothing special. They serve what most of the Americans call sushi. 
They make rolls with care, which was impressive.
The pictures on the menu looked disgusting and made me lose my appetite, though.

If you live close, it's convenient as Harris Teeter or Publix deli sushi."}
{"text":"I've cheated and swayed a few times but at the end of the day, New Zealand holds my heart. He has all of the qualities you would want in a lover: family-oriented, charming, comforting, original and dependable with a little unpredictable spice. He is simple, but knows all the way to please your palate. What more could a girl ask for?

I've sampled bits and pieces of the entire menu, but truly it is the sushi that retains me an addict, yearning for more. Despite the frequency of my visits, I still to this day have a hard time narrowing down conclusive favorites. There are so many innovative and delicious rolls on the menu that it always takes me the time length of 3 waiter/waitress visits before I decide. I do have one roll that I simply can not live without and that is the Century Roll! It comes with 8 pieces and 4 different \"toppings\" (2 tuna, 2 scallops, 2 crab, 2 octopus). The scallop pieces are what I live for! I also LOVE the Wasabi Salmon roll. It comes with this wasabi sauce that is creamy and oh so delicious! Plus, they have a $1 Nigiri/Sashimi menu! I recommend the spicy scallop, salmon, yellowtail and quail egg sashimi. They literally melt in your mouth because it's so fresh!  This is by far, one of the best gems in my treasure chest!"}
{"text":"Oh New Zealand Caf√©, I really wanted to love you...but unfortunately, I found you to be \"meh\".  

When I walked in around lunchtime the other day, there were a good number of people in the small dining area, but there were quite a few tables open, so I was seated immediately.  

Unfortunately, when I walked in, the place smelled fishy, not good. Based on the smell of the place, I was a bit worried about how fresh the sushi was, so I decided to pass on that.  

Instead, I ordered a shrimp & chicken hibachi which was served \"bento box style\" with brown rice, salad, chicken skewers, and some sort of 'cheese-filled ravioli' (odd!).  The shrimp & chicken was ok, but was a bit too salty for my preference.  The brown rice was oddly flavored, a bit greasy, and cooked with corn or something odd like that mixed in (WTH?!). The chicken skewers consisted of 2 small skewers with oddly reddish looking chicken that was seriously dry & overcooked.  The cheese ravioli thingies were also odd tasting and not especially good. Sadly, the salad was drenched in some sort of yucky salad dressing.  Overall, I was very disappointed with the food. 

On the plus side, the food was pretty cheap, and service was pretty good.  I just wish the quality & flavor of the food was better."}
{"text":"New Zealand Cafe is the place to go for some outstanding food! I've been going here for years and it has never disappointed me. Everyone must try the Tuna Poki but instead of avocado replace it with cucumbers!"}
{"text":"Years ago I was in this shopping center and I looked at New Zealand Cafe Sushi and I thought to myself that place looks like it would be sketchy.  It looked like it was a large space and would have a lot of televisions.  

Fast forward a couple of years, some good Yelp reviews and an invitation from friends, well maybe I should give it a chance.

The place is tiny, it has about 9 tables and 4 seats at the sushi bar with a bunch of televisions. Televisions are in the darndest places. The food is delicious.  There is more to offer than sushi, but I have only been twice and sushi is the only thing that I order.  I might go as far as saying it is my favorite sushi restaurant.  Every roll has been delicious, well, except for one. 

Tonight we ordered a California roll with tuna and the tuna was mushy on top, my husband said it was like cat food.  That was a bit disappointing, but not enough to make me deduct a star and certainly not enough to keep me from returning. 
My favorite roll tonight had diced jalapenos and it was burn the baby hot. It made me cry tears of happiness. Booooohoooooo."}
{"text":"I guess its true, you get what you pay for. Sometimes you get alot more then you paid for.

1st time I and my girl tried this place, The folks were very rude, but alas, we could put up with rudeness if the food is good.

We were both very far from being impressed. This was obviously not the freshest stuff...I luv sushi. I eat an awful lot of it, including on the boat with the Tuna's heart still beating (cant get better/fresher then that)

While not impressed at all, we gave it a 2nd shot. Went with another couple. All agreed it was not fresh with none of us impressed in the slightest.

But I guess we should be thankful that only 3 of the 4 of us got sick. Very sick. The only one who didnt get sick also loves sushi and after our extensive meal arrived, and being the expert he is, he chose to not even attempt to try it and ordered a chicken meal. While he wasnt impressed with it either, it was at least edible and he was the only one who didnt get violently ill. 

There will not be a third visit."}
{"text":"Food is great. A little salty for me, but I'm very sensitive to salt. So try it first! Sushi is great! I love the super Tom and tempura roll. Stuffed after! Very small space, so come early come hungry!!"}
{"text":"The sushi is on point. I had been hearing about this place for a while. Had the chance to stop in for lunch. I ordered the Itchibon Roll, it was over the top good!
I have been back 3 times since. Great staff also, GO THERE NOW! !!!"}
{"text":"This was, hands down, the best sushi I have ever had.  For that reason, it's no wonder locals tout New Zealand Cafe as having the best sushi in all of Charlotte!

The restaurant is a hole-in-the-wall in a somewhat dated strip mall.  It's very tiny with less than ten tables.  I went on a Saturday night and waited only two minutes before our party of two was seated at the sushi bar per our request.

Despite it's size and location, the sushi is absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Kudos to my fellow Yelpers that drew me here. New Zealand Caf√© is a small, cozy sushi joint tucked away in the strip mall. What I like the most is their wide selection of both hot foods and sushi. 

Maybe it is the Japanese hospitality, but the servers were all extremely nice. 

For sushi, I had a tuna hand roll, tuna, Iidako (baby octopus), salmon roe and tamago nigiri. They all lived up to my expectations. On top of that, they even gave me an extra baby octopus! 

On the benzo side, everything was very standard, well-executed. I would highly recommend the black pepper steak. 

Overall it was a good experience, and I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"I returned again - and I still think this place rocks - their rolls are huge their sushi is good and even though its small and crowded the staff is very attentive."}
{"text":"Superb!!!!!!!!
Hands down the best sushi place in town. Outstanding service too. Now... because they are good the wait time can be a little longer (30-60mim) on the weekends but it is totally worth it. So so so....glad I found this place.  I also see a lot of takeout customers because of the wait time but that also tells me they do excellent food here."}
{"text":"We used to enjoy coming here, but the last couple times have been disappointing to say the least. We waited almost an hour to be seated on Tuesday night, after our order, we had to wait another 20 mins. I ordered the bento box which was supposed to come with a california roll. Everything was overfried, chicken was bland and the california roll was pitiful and tiny and looked like it was made by a 5 year old. I couldnt even call it a sushi. 
We decided to get a take out couple days ago, figured we's skip the wait this time. We ordered the season platter which was supposed to come with postickers, shrimp and egg rolls. The potstickers were extremely small, as well as the shrimps(they also tasted raw and not grilled as described). The \"soy\" sauce that came with it was just soy flavored water. I had to toss it. The bamboo sushi was also 1/2 the size of a normal sushi roll. Definitely not worth the $22. 
Looks like we'll have to look for another good sushi place"}
{"text":"I want to give this place a bad review so people will stop going here so this place will be less crowded. But I think it's too late. Secret is out. This place is awesome.

Even though this place is very small and can be very crowded the wait for a table or food is never too long.

Sushi menu really delivers and the bento box are always a solid choice."}
{"text":"The dining space is a little bit small, but Jackie does phenomenal job with this restaurant. Make sure you get there early if it is a weekend evening. Been voted best in Charlotte many times and all you have to do is try it once to see why."}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall. I have been to many sushi places from NYC to Chicago even LA. This place is an awesome must try place. Very small cafe location but looks can be deceiving. Would highly recommend for someone looking for a casual dress sushi spot in Charlotte."}
{"text":"The food is good but the atmosphere is not so good. I think this is a good takeout place but I would not recommend if you're looking for a quiet, intimate or semi private dining experience. The tables are super close together and they packed 20 tables into a space designed for 10. 

Will try again when they expand."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place otherwise we never would have found it. Dont let the strip mall location turn you off. Its a tiny hole in the wall but the sushi is amazing and almost as good as RuSans! It is now our go to sushi place almost weekly! Rolls are creative and delicious... Try the favorite roll -ironically my favorite roll! Salt and pepper calamari and lettuce wraps are are good starters. Also good yo go with people who are not sushi fans as their dishes are really good too. If you go on the weekend go early... Gets crowded and its small."}
{"text":"Great sushi place. Very small establishment, only 12 tables and can feel very cramped and over crowded. I will definitely come back, next time I will order my sushi to go instead of eating there. We waited about 25 minutes for a table for two and about 30 for our food. The sushi was delicious and tasted great."}
{"text":"I've eaten a lot of sushi and this place is great for the price! Family owned and a Charlotte staple for years!"}
{"text":"I'm from Charlotte and can't believe I waited this long to try this place. I know it's been around for years. The sushi was delicious and so affordable! I came with friends and we all loved what we got. Service was great and we were lucky to nab the last big table during our visit."}
{"text":"Been three times. Steadily worse each time. Not another chance.
I expect frozen fish, this is Charlotte. I expect crowds, this place is tiny, and in a strip mall. I DON'T expect an hour to get 20 pieces of mediocre nigiri, even if it is on a nifty little boat. (Not sure how they are getting those CLEAN enough to eat off of, but hey, I don't work for the health department).  
It took 30 minutes to get two of us in, and 10 to get in an order. 30 mintes later, still just a beer, nothing else. Others around us just keep getting fed, we just sit. Better yet, when I have the audacity to ask what's taking so long, the waitress gets huffy and kept blathering that nigiri takes longer to make. Gee, I've never eaten sushi before, please guide me sensei.

Just admit that you screwed up somewhere. Cut the BS. Don't keep coming by and making excuses AFTER 30 MINUTES, 45 mintues, an hour.
Say something like it's on a slow boat...

30 minutes more, boat time. Ordered a small beer. Happy just to get my order in the end, but clearly some of it had been on the boat for some time. After saying so, one of the sushi chefs came out and apologized for the time taken and told me they would comp my second beer...so that's something, I suppose. 
$3.50 for an hour sounds more Chinese than Japanese, but I digress.
Two and a half hours I won't get back, and felt like a waste then and now, but maybe I can keep others from doing the same.
In sum, save your money and keep looking for better, it HAS to be out there."}
{"text":"Really excellent sushi selection - varied and delicious. This place is a tiny hole in the wall, but it is ALWAYS packed. The people are very polite and helpful. Non-sushi meals are delicious too! I get cravings for this place."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! I had never had sushi before coming here, but I'm glad I made New Zealand my first stop! The sushi is so delicious and affordable- they even have $1 and $2 pieces. I recommend the Crunchy Eel roll or the H.O.T. Roll!

They also have different meals to choose from that you would find in a normal Chinese restaurant and you get a lot of food for the price- I recommend the Queen City Chicken- which is their take on sesame chicken.

If they're busy, seating is a little cramped because it is a small space, and it can get a little loud will all those people in such a tiny area. 

I've been several times and the food & service are always great! Definitely will be my go to sushi spot!"}
{"text":"My friends and I stumbled on this place while in the area and looking for something to eat. This place was surprisingly good for a hole in the wall joint. I ordered a Big Boss roll and it was beautiful, fresh and delicious. The service was fast and curtious. I would recommend."}
{"text":"I am such a fan of New Zealand Cafe. My favorite sushi roll there is the Super Tom roll. It has shrimp and cucumber inside and shrimp and avocado on top. Simply delectable. I love it! 

Staff at this restaurant are very efficient and helpful. It never takes long for any food to arrive. I really have no complaints about New Zealand Cafe except that the restaurant is small. I wish they were able to expand, because some evenings there are so many people waiting outside for a free table. 

However, I usually try to get there before the crowd. Great food!"}
{"text":"I had been looking forward to visiting this place after hearing how good the sushi was but I found the sushi to be just ok.  The place is quite small so timing is everything if you want to eat in.  I had the family chicken with mixed veggies, rice, salad, 2 shrimp, and 2 crab rangoons for $6.95, great deal for all that you get and it was pretty good.  I also had a crunchy lobster salad roll which looked great but it was way too chewy and the crunch was actually wet and mushy........yuk!  So, I'm not sure if that means the seaweed wrap was old or what but it was not cool.  The service was nice and friendly and it seems like a popular place but I doubt I'll return for a second visit."}
{"text":"This might be my new sushi go-to in Charlotte when I want some amazing sushi for great prices!  The restaurant is small and usually very busy so you have to wait for a table, but it is so worth it!  The sushi is fresh and so good and doesn't cost you an arm and a leg, which is a nice change from many other sushi spots around town.  We could see that many people take advantage of the take out also since the line looped around the restaurant for pick up orders.  We've already been back a few times since trying it and will keep going back for more!  Drink prices are very reasonable, as well!"}
{"text":"Looking for fresh sushi? This is the place to go in Matthews. Fresh, tasty, generous portions. The staff, and owner, Jackie, are super friendly! It's always busy. And if you come in five minutes before closing, they're still eager to serve you!"}
{"text":"We've only eaten here once so far but it was by far the best of all the sushi places we've tried since moving to the area. The rolls and sashimi we had were very good, my only complaint is the very crowded, tight space. We went early (5ish) which is fine with us but by the time we left it was a packed zoo. Not very enjoyable. If the sushi wasn't so good we wouldn't go back but it was so we will. Will def consider take out though and will continue our search for delicious sushi AND relaxing environment."}
{"text":"The best Asian food in Charlotte
I've been eating here for over 10 years. Their meals and sushi are awesome.

Sushi rolls"}
{"text":"It is located in the Harris Teeter shopping center,next to the \"Chinese Food\" sign.
Tiny restaurant,the lightning is a little dark,limited seating and yes the tables are really close to each other. It feels a little uncomfortable. 
The sushi is really average, it taste like grocery store bought sushi,except it's not cold. Most of their rolls are deep fried. 
The quality of food and price are both lower compare to other sushi restaurants.
I would maybe just order take out from time to time if I'm feeling cheap and need a quick sushi fix."}
{"text":"Best sushi in town! Love it wish the place was bigger because there's always a wait list to sit down.. deff worth it though!"}
{"text":"So its our anniversary and my wife would like to get some sushi....living in Matthews that can be difficult. I had seen the restaurant in the past but was not sure. WOW - a great venue for sure. Very small - close in tables for couples and medium sized groups - lots of attentive waitrons - and a nice menu for any tastes. We went with three big rolls that did not disappoint. The house Vino Tinto was good for the price. Folks were cutting up and talking and having an all around good time. The food was good - fresh and tasteful - but everyone else around us was the cinch!"}
{"text":"Most amazing sushi in the Charlotte area. Truly creative, fresh and worth the wait. We go all the time!"}
{"text":"Best sushi you will eat. Ask for the cilantro roll it's not on the menu. I'd have given a 5 Star but it's also the worst service you will ever get. For take out order 45-1 hr ahead. They tell you 30 minutes and it's never that. They're not the nicest people at the counter either so you just got to suck it up and know the food is phenomenal."}
{"text":"Very good food that is inexpensive. Nice to find a gluten free spot near the movie theater."}
{"text":"Best sushi in town. I recommend and send a lot of people and they feel the same way! Cathy and Jackie are awesome!"}
{"text":"Always fresh here! Love the free birthday meal too! Small space so show up early if you want a table. Best to call in advance for take out too."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The best sushi ever and even if someone isn't a fan of fish they have many other items to choose from. Excellent value!!"}
{"text":"Great sushi but first time visitor's be warned. It is a very small restaurant. If you go during prime hours, you will be waiting a long time. It can also be very noisy and probably not the best choice for families with small children. That being said, go during non-peak hours with one other person and you can have a fantastic meal."}
{"text":"I've been sitting here for 1 hour and 25min and I just received my food. Great food, but order to go. They take priority in that."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to order takeout!  Consistently great food. Don't judge it by the strip shopping center location. Fresh awesome Sushi and great service."}
{"text":"Strange name for a sushi joint! The menu said that it was actually a chain that offered Asian and New Zealand cuisines. I'm not sure which items were more New Zealand-esce because I mainly saw typically Japanese dishes/sushi options. 

After getting past the restaurant name and confusion, I was able to concentrate on their extensive menu. As their sign outside indicates, they offer some sashimi between $1-$1.75. In addition, they have a lot of rolls to choose from. I got the spicy tuna and veggie tempura rolls ($4.95 and $4.55). Very good! The pricing was great!

Like others have indicated, the space is small with seating for maybe 12 in the middle, 6 high/stool tables on the sides, and a sushi bar to fit 3 at the front. The service is okay, but lacked on refilling drinks. When you go, be assertive or you may go without. 

This location is in the Harris Teeter strip mall area. It's tucked away next to a nail salon. I wish it was closer to where I lived because I'm sure I would go here more often (I get sushi cravings regularly). If you love sushi, try this place...all of the previous reviews are right on!"}
{"text":"The sushi here is amazing! I don't know what it is but its so delicious and I'm actually full after my meal. 
I'm a New Yorker and our sushi portions are so small its usually 6 pieces, not very filling. 
The atmosphere is nice and quiet. They even have seating outside and you can bring food out (you just have to pay first). 
The owner's really nice and friendly and clearly knows his stuff!"}
{"text":"We called this restaurant before we got on the road to eat here because we had a 25 mile drive to eat here and had heard good things so we wanted to give it a try. I informed the lady we had 4 small kids and would be driving a good 25 miles to eat there so I wanted to see what the wait time was. She said they weren't too busy and it would only be about 10-15 minutes. We immediately left and drove the 25 miles and when we pulled up we noticed a huge crowd outside. I called the lady again and she again informed me it wasn't too crowded and would only be about a 15 minute wait. We got our kids out and got inside, and the hostess at the front said oh no the wait would be an hour or more. I said what? We just spoke with a lady and she told me differently. She said oh I'll have to let her know it's longer. They were very unsympathetic and could care less that we had 4 hungry kids and just drove 25 plus miles to only get turned around and find another place to eat! I am very appalled by how their customer service was and the lack of sympathy or apology. I will NEVER eat here. I understand we came on a Friday night, but all they had to do was tell us the real wait time and there would have been no issues! No matter how good a place may be, if there customer service is bad, it ruins their whole business!"}
{"text":"This place has an amazing food, average customer service, cozy atmosphere. I had few issues with their sushi few years ago (which made me stop going there) but my recent visit changed my mind in a positive way again."}
{"text":"We love this place,  seating area is small so we don't usually order in.  We do alot take out and drive from Mint Hill.  Always good."}
{"text":"Stayed up the road and did a search for sushi.  Was concerned about the name but gave it a shot.  Small place, and no frills, but it was clear it was popular with all the people.  We got there at 5 and got lucky to get a seat.  A line formed soon after and lots of take out telling us it must be good.

Sashimi was good although slices were a bit small, and I prefer mine to be very cold.  Normally sashimi comes in 3 pieces per order and these were 1 per.  Rolls were excellent.  Everyone liked it and for where it is it was a nice surprise.  Again I prefer my sushi colder but it was tasty.  

Would definitely go back to try some other things."}
{"text":"Somebody PLEASE CLEAN THIS ESTABLISHMENT!!!!!

Absolutely disgusting, years of grime on the hallway walls, bathrooms, floors are corroding, rusted out doors. Really?? How is this place even open!!!!"}
{"text":"I went here last night with a friend to try out a new Sushi restaurant. IT WAS EXCELLENT!! I'm a fan of Ru Sans, but the past couple of times I had been there much was to be desired....and it was noisy 9/10 times. The NZC is in a nice spot, and although the place is small, it's cozy and you can actually hear a conversation. The waitress was polite and tentative, as well as the greeter. The biggest thing though- was the Sushi. I had a ginger salad to start (yum), then the Vegetable Tempura Maki roll (yum) and sampled some of my friends crispy Tuna Maki roll- also yum. I found a new Sushi place to go- goodbye Ru Sans."}
{"text":"Eat here with your eyes closed. The decor isn't THAT bad but you certainly don't frequent New Zealand Cafe for its strip mall ambiance. Don't let the fake plants and cramped dining room scare you off. The food is at least fifty percent better than you would think.

Service can be a bit slow so grab an app. Rolls are fresh, varied (tons of non-fried options) and affordable. Four rolls at dinner with beers ran us about $37 before tax and tip. This is a great spot for affordable sushi or try the bento box for a little bit of everything.

I wish they had more outdoor seating -only two tables- but this place is the only place in the area with quality sushi. It is packed for a reason."}
{"text":"Wow.....all I gotta say is Wow. You wouldn't think driving around in Matthews that this random lil strip mall would provide amaaaazing sushi. But yes I did. A friend of ours who had discovered this sushi heaven decided to take us Charlotte newbies for a real sushi treat. Coming from NYC where good Sushi restaurants are a dime a dozen....I was a bit skeptical. I mean there isn't a true shoreline here in Charlotte. How fresh can the seafood really get? very very fresh is the answer. The restaurant itself is very homey and the service is always polite and fast. The sushi chefs themselves are a bit very slow. Probably because its a father son duo doing their thing. But the wait is worth it. We ordered like 8 rolls and the 3 of us ate and ate till we couldn't eat anymore. the menu is extensive and well priced. But the sauces were the real winners for me. Most of the specialty sushi rolls come with this amazing spicy sauces and they are just divine. I didn't care for the rolls with roe in it because it was a bit too fishy for me. But the rest of the rolls were rocking ;o) Definite try for all sushi snobs and sushi virgins too :o)"}
{"text":"This place is great!!!! Never had bad service. It's very small but makes you feel cozy"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Charlotte, my personal choice for quality food and sushi at a cheap price, and I bring all out-of-town visitors here.  While their special rolls may be priced in the $10-13 range, standard rolls like spicy tuna run about $4, and my personal favorite, the Super Spicy Roll is $6.  

If you're in the mood for more filling fare, the bento boxes are the way to go, as they come with entree, salad, rice/noodles, and a small side item - all for $6.  My favorite is the Thai Curry Chicken, but I have tried almost all entrees on the menu and haven't been disappointed.  

My only complaint is that this place is small, with only 10-12 tables, so there is almost always a wait.  and, when they are particularly busy, it can be a little while before your food comes out.  but it is worth the wait, and like someone said before - thats a perfect time for a beer."}
{"text":"SO SO SO good! The sushi is always fresh & delicious and the wait staff is super friendly! Great sushi for spicy food lovers!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in charlotte. They also have a great selection of gluten free options. Ask for the gluten free soy sauce."}
{"text":"New Zealand Cafe is a small sushi and Asian cuisine restaurant tucked away in a small strip-mall near Matthews. The sushi is always super fresh, the rolls are creative, prices are a steal and above all the food is delicious.  If i lived closer i would be here at least twice a week. Easily. It's that good.
The space itself is pretty small so more times than not there is a wait to be seated. They do a decently paced turn-over on the tables though so its usually not too long and it is totally worth it.  To kill time I usually grab a menu and to read so when im in i am ready to order.
Everything i have ever had at New Zealand Cafe has been great! Ginger salad, miso soup, apps. noodles, chicken entrees, seafood entrees, sushi... all soooo good! The sushi is outstanding. Some of the best in town.  If you order enough of it it they will put it on a boat for you. Know someone who doesn't appreciate a good sushi boat? Well, their entrees are awesome too. For around $6-10 the entrees include- the protein (ex: Mango Chicken, Teriyaki Chicken etc) , rice or noodles, a house salad and then 2 of the following: chicken skewers, fried shrimp, crab rangoon. That's 5 items for as little as $6 and no they don't skimp on the portion size either. There will most likely be left overs to take home. It's almost hard to believe how good of a deal these meals are.
If your ever in the area, or hell-even if your not, I suggest a trip to New Zealand Cafe. It will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"New Zealand isn't the quickest place to get sushi, their restaurant is very small and compact, and it's seemingly always crowded from open to close. I've waited thirty minutes or more several times, but once you sit down and enjoy your first bite, you realize why they're so popular. It's easy to tell the chefs at NZ have a passion for what they do, the sushi is fresh, clean, flavorful, and has great texture. Just trust me and your fellow Yelpers, if you like sushi and you live in Charlotte, this is your place. 

I recommended NZ to a couple friends who never tried sushi, and had them try the eel and shrimp tempura rolls, a mild, safe bet for a sushi first timer. Of course they loved it, but I was surprised when they devoured the mackerel nigiri. I'm so grateful that I live near NZ, but if I didn't, I'd go a few miles out of my way if I had that hard to satisfy sushi itch, and once you try NZ, you just may too!"}
{"text":"Maybe I caught them on a bad, but their reviews do not match my experience. Sushi was not fresh and service was dull. I will give the waitress props for jacking my tip, I paused while putting my change in my pocket and she scoop my left over change about a 25% tip"}
{"text":"The only reason why I'm giving New Zealand Cafe four stars is because of the space. The owners should just buy both buildings on either side of them, knock down the walls, and expand! It's just too small!
Other than that, everything is wonderful. The waiters are polite. The food is great. Even the ambience is pleasant. It's just too small. If they would deliver, that would make everything a whole lot better."}
{"text":"I love New Zealand. Only downfall is it is always so crowded you can barely breathe. I wish the place was bigger. Their food is reasonably priced. Sushi is great and so is their garden salad with ginger dressing."}
{"text":"Never had sushi and never been to NZC. Food was amazing and atmosphere is great too. Really small hole in the wall, but truly great food. People were lined up to be seated as it's a very crowded eating area. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"You know there was a time when I didn't like sushi but this place really sets the bar high when it comes to the sushi.  I took a friend here last night and was impressed by Cathryn's knowledge, empathy and customer service while she took care of us.  The d√©cor and design could use a revamp.  They are usually quite cramped here just because of all the business they receive.  I will say their machine accepts Apple Pay, Android Pay, Samsung Pay, Microsoft Wallet and other NFC compatible payment services BUT GOOD LUCK getting the manager that usually runs the register to let you attempt to use it.  I was successful but she was like next time bring your card.  I won't be bringing my card because I never carry it on me so if they won't accept my method of payment which literally every other merchant will accept or at least attempt to accept then I won't do business at your establishment.  This is no reflection on Cathryn's service as she was trying her best to get it to work and was a star for hospitality and customer service.  You get a very decent amount of food here.  I was full and had to take the rest home.  This place really makes great food and fresh sushi.     

If I have cash I may stop back by otherwise if they don't want to let me pay how I want guess I can't eat there"}
{"text":"For visiting From California and looking at the reviews! Don't be fooled by the appearance of the Strip mall... always trust your instincts, worst sushi and terrible service"}
{"text":"So great! I recommend the Crab and Asparagus Roll. Everyone at the table agreed that it was outstanding. The other rolls that we tried and recommend are the Big Boss Roll, the Crunch Roll Max, Dynamite Roll, Firecracker Roll, and Sweet Dragon Roll. Don't forget to get some potstickers for your appetizer. They are also excellent. The red bean ice cream was yummy.  The fried banana dessert was ok but nothing special."}
{"text":"I am always pleased with this establishment. Portions are great. Service is fast. Prices are good. Fish quality is good. Rolls are tight and keep together. Roll size is large but not too large for your mouth. Great carry out and nice relaxed atmosphere for dine in. There is one middle aged skinny Asian waitress that will rush you for your carry out or dine in order so if you get her be warned. The other staff is fantastic. The middle aged sushi chief has been there forever and knows what he is doing. Be sure to tip him and look for his big thankful smile and genuine gratitude while he nods in courteous gesture."}
{"text":"Awesomeness! My only dislike is this place is tiny and so popular. Get here early so you don't have to wait. Other than that....OMG amazing!"}
{"text":"Great sushi. I'm obsessed with their tempura veggie roll! i've tried many others and have not been disappointed yet. Their entrees are alright, the best that i've had is their Chili pepper shrimp and that packed some serious heat. Their crab ragoons which they call crab cheese raviolli is disappointing and lacks flavor as well as substance. But if your looking for take out sushi this is your place, you can stay and eat but they are usually pretty busy and are tucked in a small space in a strip mall off monroe rd. and can get loud and crowded."}
{"text":"By far the best spot in Charlotte for sushi! Great prices mixed with great service. I don't understand how anyone could be disappointed."}
{"text":"The sushi here is great and I have been here many times but the last time I went the service was the worst I have ever experienced. Multiple people including myself were waiting on food for HOURS. After our appetizer it took 45 minutes for our food that wasn't cooked (sushi) to come out. Another note is that the restaurant was dead so it made no sense to take that long. I will never be coming back here I will take my business somewhere else. No one checked on us, apologized, nothing. Horrible service."}
{"text":"My one complaint about this place is that it's too far from my home :(  I used to live closer and this is my favorite sushi in Charlotte by a long margin.  They are super consistent with their quality.  I've tried most of the major sushi players and there are others that are great at times, but they just don't have the consistency.  If you love sushi and you haven't been here, make it your next destination and you'll be impressed.  The place is small, and it's not fancy.  They deserve to be on a wait every night."}
{"text":"New Zealand Caf√© came highly recommended by friends and neighbors around town. Labeled as \"a hidden gem of Charlotte,\" my expectations were set. I was ready to be wowed. I decided to make the 30 min trek out to Matthews to give this place a try. When I arrived, it was very crowded and we had a 30-45 min wait which seemed normal at a place with so much hype around it. Once we were seated, we ordered 2 rolls of sushi and toro nigiri. The sushi was very salty and had no flavor. I remained hopeful as we still had their infamous sushi boat on the way. Once the boat arrived, it was the same thing. Salty, no flavor, not fresh. This place was extremely disappointing. Not only was it under average sushi, it was the same price, if not more than some of the better sushi restaurants around Charlotte. New Zealand Caf√© is great for people who are not regular sushi eaters. Anyone who knows good sushi, is better off going to Jade or Ru San's. Also, be prepared for the dining experience to take at least 2 hours (even on a Sunday)."}
{"text":"New Zealand Caf√© is my go to place for Sushi for the past 8 years. They have never disappointed me in the quality of their sushi, taste or service. I love their cozy interior. Sometimes the wait is long, but there is always to-go available and they are always right and quick. They are amazing there! If you don't know what to get or are new to trying sushi the sushi chefs take very good care of you with their selections. They have other entrees available for the non-sushi lovers, but everyone that hasn't liked sushi, I have converted here. That is saying a lot! Love New Zealand Caf√©!!!!"}
{"text":"New Zealand was recommended to us by a friend and we are so happy it was. Hubs and I visited here a couple years ago and then went again recently with friends, and it's still amazing.

Don't judge a book by it's cover - the place is small and it's located in a strip mall, but it's one of the best sushi places in Charlotte. Depending on where you are located, it's a bit of a drive, but again, worth it. The inside is small but it's clean and cute. The staff are knowledgable and skilled; our waitress took our order for 4 people and didn't write anything down. Impressive!

The menu is diverse and they have bento boxes and other authentic dishes besides sushi. The variety of rolls is awesome and they are always FRESH. The prices are very reasonable too - 6 sushi rolls and a bento box costs us $58. This place is definitely a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat. I've been coming here for years! The food is great and you can't beat the prices. The place is pretty small so it's always crowded but it's worth it for the food that you get."}
{"text":"Got there at 5:50pm, waited 50 min for a table (was told 20) and then waited 1hr 10min for food. Crazy. Luckily I had nothing better to do. Ha! Almost nobody in the restaurant had food, yet it seemed that there was a steady flow of take out orders going out. This is not the first time this has happened while I've been here either. I guess I'll never understand why they don't suspend take-out orders while there are lots of tables sitting with NO FOOD for extended periods of time. That said, the sushi is great and the price is fantastic. I'll stick with going for lunch in the future."}
{"text":"Kind of glad i wasn't the first one to give it 3 stars. i did really dig this place for making a cool little restaurant in a standard looking strip mall. It was quite a trek out there for us, but looking at 20+ reviews of only 4 and 5 stars was convincing. 

Not being a huge sushi eater, i went with the H.O.T. rolls and something i knew i'd enjoy in the buffalo shrimp dinner. For non-sushi fans, the H.O.T. rolls really don't have any sort of gross sushiness to them, so a good choice in that respect. They didn't wow us all that much though. The buffalo shrimp came with rice, a salad and two sticks of chicken. The rice and shrimp were good and the salad was decent with a couple cucumbers, but the chicken on a stick was like something you find on a Chinese buffet.

My wife, the reason i frequently end up at sushi places was happy with the prices, but didn't think the sushi stood out from others (Nikko or Edomae) . She ordered the rainbow roll and the bagel roll. The rainbow roll didn't seem to have all that great quality of fish, some of it was chewy. The bagel roll was like a ground salmon that didn't have the typical salmon flavor she was expecting from sushi. 
She's still convinced that the quality of Nikko's sushi is still superior."}
{"text":"Aweful.  Worst sushi I have had anywhere.  The sushi is thin and skimpy and the other dishes were so terrible. I could tell the other patrons have not had real sushi.  It's cheap and the reason there are so many great reviews.  Quantity not quality here."}
{"text":"Wonderful sushi at a good price. Only negative was the overcrowded nicely decorated, clean, but small dining room without a decent waiting area on a cold night. Still five star food and service."}
{"text":"I've been to New Zealand Cafe several times and have never been disappointed with their sushi or service. In fact, this is probably the best sushi I've ever had. It is, by far, the best sushi in Charlotte (Yes, better than Cowfish). You can't go wrong with any of their specialty rolls. Love the christmas roll"}
{"text":"This place is snappy, fresh and has awesome customer service!

Every time I've been here around 6pm or later durring the week I've been seated very quickly.

I've gotten the Crispy Tuna Roll, Volcano roll and the New Zealand Chicken a couple times. All thier food is of very high quality and tastes fresh. 

The host, servers and all of the sushi staff are very nice, accommodating, and are very knowledgeable about the menu. 

You will not be disapointed. This place is so good and is a almost a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Delicious sushi! Great service. Most likely, best sushi in town. My husband and I go there very often"}
{"text":"We went based on what we had heard and read on Yelp. I'd have to disagree on the 'best' in town. Until the food was served, everything matched the positive reviews. There was a line. It was small and quaint. 
I order two different rolls. I think one I ordered was a H.O.T. Roll which was described as spicy tuna, cream cheese, with jalape√±o and lightly battered. The tuna tasted like it was from a can.  The other roll was a safe order meaning that it is a roll you could get anywhere and it would meet expectations.
I think, with anything, you must try a place for yourself to make your own judgement. Service was friendly but the food was nothing to get excited over. It's not a place I would be excited to try again."}
{"text":"I've been here many times so after having a bad experience I naturally wanted to try it again and make sure it wasn't just an off night. I tried it 3 more times and all were bad, the quality of the sushi has definitely diminished. The sushi smells really fishy and it doesn't taste fresh. The last time I tried it I got really sick. 

Rolls I've had: Big Boss, Crunchy, Supper Spicy and Charlotte Roll. 

I am really disappointed as this was one of my favorite sushi places :o("}
{"text":"This people are so nice I hate to leave it on that sour a note. The place is great, the service is great.  Please, pretty please find a better chef and raise dinner prices accordingly. Trying to serve a complete quality dinner for $6.95 today is ludicrous."}
{"text":"We were just in the Charlotte area for a night after an event. This was recommended to us and near where we were staying.  Glad we went! I had the Toro nigiri and a salmon dish. My bf had a chicken dish. The nigiri was SO good. The other food was good as well. I'd go back if in town again. Plus the prices are very reasonable. We thought it must be the lunch menu prices at first."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite sushi restaurants in Charlotte. They have an amazing selection of all different types of sushi and Asian inspired dishes. The restaurant itself is on the smaller side so there might be a wait if you come with larger parties. Prices are unbeatable, sushi is amazing, service is great..what more can you ask for? NZC definitely delivers."}
{"text":"I was skeptical about all the rave reviews of NZ Cafe's sushi. But they were spot-on correct! Best sushi I've had in the Charlotte area. Very fresh. Balanced flavors and textures. Also loved the seaweed salad. Our waiter was attentive and helpful. The tiny place was packed with a happy, friendly crowd. My new go-to place for Sushi."}
{"text":"Stuck alone in a new city driving around looking for a place to enjoy my lunch hour, a sign caught my eye in a strip mall.  New Zealand?  My mind flashed back to my college trip to the Kiwi Isle.  Back then I was determined to eat something New Zealand other than the fruit.  Everytime I asked where a good \"New Zealand style\" restaurant would be I ended up directed to a mediocre Chinese buffet.  Sorry, New Zealanders that is from China; the Maoris did not invent General Tso's chicken.  Perhaps my culinary quest was at an end.  I pulled in to the boring suburban strip mall and 'Sushi bar' was stenciled on the windows underneath.  Slightly disappointed I decided to give it a whirl anyway, though a bit skeptical that sushi in a southern suburb might resemble that in a King of the Hill episode that was derived from canned tuna.  Opening the door however I delighted to see a very tastefully decorated and quaint interior with what looked to be actual Asians and not disguised Mexicans.  I, of course, tried the local Charlotte roll which was an Avocado on top style, my favorite.  It was delicious.  I'm quite pleased with my strip mall gem.

Update: Since eaten here around a dozen times.  I've tried tons of their specialty rolls.  My favorites were the:
HOT Roll - jalapeno, spicy tuna, cream cheese!
Ichiban Spicy Roll - Spicy Tuna, Crab, Avocado, red sauce
Bombing Roll - Fried in mint leaf
Wasabi Salmon Roll (w/ out mayo, eeg) - it's beautiful
Rainbow Roll - Even more beautiful and delicious

Also, good is the fried banana 'sushi' (which is more than enough for one person), the red bean ice cream and the really good service.  It was a sad goodbye my last week there eating 5 times.  Thanks everyone there!"}
{"text":"Amazing!  Jackie never ever let's me down.  Ive eaten hear at least 50 times and it is always excellent.  I east sushi all over the country and this is some of the best I've found stateside.  

Tip:  ask for a spicy smoked salmon skin hand roll.  I eat two to three each time.  

Don't bring a large group but do bring patience as they are busy EVERY day during lunch and dinner.  Worth the wait!"}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is so slow. The restaurant itself is tiny so the time it takes for food to be made & brought to your table is ridiculous. Out last visit it took the waitress almost 15 minutes to bring us water and our food took over an hour. Once the food arrives it wasn't prepared as we ordered it. 
I noticed they do a heavy amount of take out and people were complaining  about their takeout orders taking over an hour. 
Management needs to get a new business plan in place because if they don't this place will lose its popularity and close down."}
{"text":"Don't let the name (or the strip mall) fool you. It's really a diamond in the rough when it comes to sushi places. Once you try it I guarantee you will go back for more."}
{"text":"There's a reason it's cramped and the service is sometimes a bit slow.  This is the best sushi for the price in a hundred miles.  I would love for the place to move close by but to a larger location but that is really our only complaint.  We have always had fresh delicious sushi here.  We also have young children and have been surprised more than once by an impromptu dessert of free sliced oranges for them sent over by Jackie the lead chef.  If you want to go to Center City and pay $10 for a California roll be my guest but the sushi here is worth the wait."}
{"text":"The sushi may be great, but I will never know because my husband and I left after waiting for our food for almost an hour.

Very small place with no ambience and takeout orders seem to receive priority status. If you cannot serve your in house customers you should really stop accepting phone in orders at some point."}
{"text":"My boyfriend likes this place a lot better than I do. But he likes sushi, and I don't. 

Very crowded when we went, ended up ordering our food for takeout. It was evident that people loved this place over the Chinese restaurant next door. 

I had the mango chicken, wish it came with more chicken and less mango. Hated the rice. Boyfriend loved his two huge sushi rolls but I forget what they were called. 

Not sure I would go back unless he begged me to get sushi, but I am glad we tried someplace new."}
{"text":"The place is always packed, and for a good reason. The NZ Cafe offers some amazing sushi for a affordable price. You won't leave disappointed. I have tried the Philly roll and I loved it."}
{"text":"Had take-out from here the other night... We were in the mood for sushi, read the reviews on Yelp and just decided to go for it. We weren't disappointed. 

I can't comment on atmosphere, (as we had take-out and my significant other picked it up.  I still haven't seen the place, but I am familiar with where it is. 

We had an order of edamame, and 4 maki rolls (Crispy Bagel, California, Crispy Spicy Tuna, and Crab Cream Cheese Avocado) as well as an order of their garlic noodles. Everything was delicious aside from the noodles... yuck. Won't bother with those again. 

The sushi was fresh and fabulous. We'll definitely be back, at least for take-out! Yum!!"}
{"text":"There is not a lot of seating so come early or be patient. It will be worth it. All food is prepared fresh. Sushi bar right up front with nothing to hind. Hot food comes out from the back. The best deal are the bento type meals. They include a whole  meal."}
{"text":"THE BEST SUSHI ROLLS IN CHARLOTTE. Having in mind that sushi calls for horse, cow and fish, ( THE FIRST TWO YOU ARE NOT GOING TO FIND IT HERE)this is , if not the best, a great place to indulge yourself  eating this beautiful asian dish!!"}
{"text":"I'm not really sure where the name fits in, but New Zealand Cafe has great Asian food. I admit, when we pulled up I struggled to put aside my preconceived notions about strip mall restaurants. The Yelp reviews looked pretty decent and my companions swore it was safe. I didn't get any sushi, but the sushi my companions ordered looked good (and it came out on a cool wooden boat!) I ordered the Queenstown's chicken entree which came with 2 fried shrimp, brown rice, 2 crab Rangoon patties. All that food for around 6 bucks! Great value! The chicken was crispy and battered then covered in sweet & sour sauce. It was really good. We were seated at a 4 person high-top as we arrived. The restaurant was kind of small, so I imagine it gets crowded quickly. Service was good, lunch was pretty cheap all around a great experience."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place, but it just didn't happen-at all. We got a to-go order of \"potstickers\", snow crab/shrimp roll, and a salmon tempura roll. We were told it would be ready in 20 minutes on a Sunday (about 8:30 P.M.)
     To start, the place is like a broom closet. As you walk in, the register is at the far end of the restaurant - with literally 2 feet between the counter and the drink stand. While waiting in line to pay, we had to maneuver around the 2 foot space 3x for the wait staff. 
     The chefs didn't even begin to make our order until 10 minutes after our 20 minute arrival time. After paying, we moved to stand by the hallway to the restrooms, still seemly in the way of everyone- it was very uncomfortable. On to the food:
     The salmon tempura roll was a sad sight, but tasted okay. The crab/shrimp roll: the shrimp and avocado were fresh, but the crab looked like little hairs and was poorly represented. The \"potstickers/gyoza\" were a pathetic excuse for their name. They were mushy and bland. Even the dipping sauce served with them was a pale representation of what it should have been. 
     I know of many others that are much better than this place. They can serve 1$ sushi all day long, but I'll never come back."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best sushi in Charlotte. Get the boat! You get an amazing amount of sushi for a great price. The only downside is the wait--the restaurant is SMALL."}
{"text":"Have only done takeout here but a great experience! This place is always swamped and there is a line out the door, for good reason. The sushi is all very fresh, the rolls are inventive and the price is awesome! It's hard to beat $1 sashimi, and $5 for dynamite rolls. 

On a related note, my kids love their ginger orange chicken, and it really is good!"}
{"text":"Just wanted to write a quick update - I am still crazy in love with this place. However, I've updated my favorite rolls - I am currently completely head over heels for the Big Boss roll and the Crunch Roll Max. I've tried almost all of the specialty rolls, and have really loved every one. I have noticed that they've been busier, so even lunch is packed now. For good reason. You can't go wrong here. And please let me know when you're going :)"}
{"text":"I decided to come here thanks to all of the raves on Yelp and I kind of regret that now.
 
My friend and I showed up around 5:00 on a Friday and we were able to walk right in and grab the last of two tables. As everyone has already mentioned, it's very small inside. There are six high top tables and then about four to five standard tables in the middle.  We were originally at one of the lower tables but a party of four consisting of small children came in and we were kindly asked to move to a high-top table. We weren't disappointed with that at all. The high top tables afford you some conversational privacy.

I ordered a glass of the plum wine (which was delicious) and then placed my order for a rose roll and vegetable tempura roll. The menu is not only sushi-focused, there are also bento box combos, fried rice, teriyaki chicken and steak, etc.

Our food arrived and it was decent although my rolls were wider than expected. What I will say about the sushi is that this is a good place to bring sushi newbies. They provide a lot of tempura options as well as rolls with mayo/cream cheese. The rose roll I ordered consisted of spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, avocado, cucumber and cheese sauce on the side. I didn't have any of the cheese sauce. The vegetable tempura consisted of fried broccoli, sweet potato, and zucchini.

The waitresses were great, friendly, and super willing to accommodate any needs. After we were done with our food, my friend and I both agreed that we've had better sushi.

Unfortunately, hours later (in the wee hours of the morning), I was struck with sharp stomach pains that led to me having to spend some time near a toilet bowl. I didn't have anything else to eat that night after leaving New Zealand Cafe so I'm utterly confused as to why my body reacted the way it but, needless to say, I won't be going back to find out."}
{"text":"I will begin by stating that I am far from a sushi connoisseur. I have been to some fine sushi places (nobu etc, cldc in Barcelona) etc. 

I got the lobster avocado shrimp roll and my date got the \"master roll\" 

The rolls very honestly very good and delicious. I especially liked the master roll. 

The reason I am giving it 3 stars is because the service is abysmally slow. 

The sushi took at least 45 minutes to get here. 

It took at least 10 minutes for the server to get my check back to me after I placed my card in the card holder. 


These wait times are simply unacceptable. This place could be even busier but they need to get the turnover higher."}
{"text":"Since I'm review #259, I'll keep it short-ish. The fella is a serious sushi-lover, and after the numerous places he's eaten, he still thinks Musashi in south Charlotte is the very best when it comes to sushi. After our first trip to New Zealand Cafe (thanks to Yelpers' suggestions), it just leap-frogged to No. 2 of all time. 

We started with the steamed pot stickers, which were fresh and delicious. I'm not a sushi eater, so I appreciated that they had other options. I got the chicken bento box, which came with chicken and broccoli in a delicious, homemade brown sauce, two fried shrimp, two crab rangoons, brown rice, and a salad. I also appreciated that they offered me a fork! He got a special roll - the Bamboo  - along with a few pieces of Nigiri. There weren't as many pieces in the Bamboo roll as he hoped, but that was the only bad thing about it. 

Service was outstanding, and since they were even more packed than usual and running a little behind, they brought us complimentary edamame. The only negative thing I can say isn't even their fault - their food is so delicious and their space is so small that it was a 30-minute wait at 5:30 on a Saturday with hardly anywhere to stand inside on a cold day."}
{"text":"New Zealand Cafe is a treasure hidden in an old strip mall.  The food is good and inexpensive -- a great combination, in my book.  Sushi is one of those things I am always hesitant to order (although I usually enjoy it once I do), so I have yet to try any of NZC's offerings in that area.  However, their bento-box esque dinners are delicious.  For $6-10, depending on your selection, you get the main entree, two chicken skewers, two crab rangoons, rice, and a salad.  It's hard to beat that value, especially when it tastes so good.  I especially recommend the Fantasy Shrimp (with a unique, delicious fruity mayonnaise sauce) or the Crispy Scallops.

The only reason I New Zealand Cafe doesn't get 5 stars is because the inside is cramped, which means that the lines can be long and the dining crowded if you don't feel like take out."}
{"text":"Best sushi.  Great staff!  Love this place.

It is small, so, you go during peak dining hours, be prepared to wait.  It's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I absolutely love New Zealand Cafe, a hidden gem in a less than stellar strip mall (with a name that sounds like it has nothing to do with sushi). It is some of the best sushi we have ever had at prices half as much as most other restaurants ($7-11 for a roll versus $12-16 elsewhere, for example). With that being said, we no longer actually eat at NZ Cafe. The restaurant is TINY. As in, I hope you want to have dinner with the strangers sitting next to you because you'll be on top of them and vice versa. Also, with only a few tables in the restaurant (maybe 10 tops), on busy weekend nights you might find yourself waiting for up to an hour. Once you're seated, the service is typically great (friendly, cordial) albeit slow as molasses so don't expect this to be a quick trip. One dine-in experience took about two and a half hours from start to finish.

As a result of the less than stellar dine-in experience, my fiance and I order takeout regularly instead. We call ahead (well before we are hungry because take-out can take a while, too) and pick up our sushi to enjoy at home. They have a nice variety and it is great quality as well. I would highly recommend this place for sushi takeout any day."}
{"text":"Small but worth the wait. Yes there are all your traditional sushi items on their menu but then there are some real gems. Unexpected, and crazy delicious. I wish it was closer for us..."}
{"text":"So we were a little skeptical about eating at what yelp advertised as a one $ sushi place but I must admit we were impressed when we sat down. The food is awesome and the ambiance is pleasant. Definitely a new favorite!!!"}
{"text":"Can you say over-rated?? The sushi, food, and service is all subpar. I've had much better sushi in this city without waiting 30 minutes for a table"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. I love their food - Asian-style, \"fusion,\" even. If you come at peak dining hours, be prepared to wait. It's a \"cozy\" joint, but well worth the wait. The sushi is ALWAYS superb, and there's always a chef's special of the day to try. There's a variety of Asian beers and sake to try (and I love hot sake). Everyone is very friendly and the service is fast (although, they get very busy at times, especially on the weekends, which can affect the speed a little). Everyone I know, who's been here loves this place."}
{"text":"We've only been in for sit-down twice, and carryout from a friend, once, but every time the experience, and food, has been just marvelous. Or last trip in November for our son's birthday was a party from the get-go. We had 2 ladies waiting on us - I think the hostess Sunny (who wanted to hang out with us after her shift! haha), and our waitress whose name, unfortunately, I didn't recall. But she was amazing! So funny and pleasant and sassy. A perfect accompaniment to our fun gang. She could easily do stand-up. I'm remiss in writing this review earlier because I really wanted to compliment them. I'm not ever sure what we ate (or drank) but I can guarantee it was delicious. If you have to wait to get a table, it's worth it."}
{"text":"This place has been one of my favorite resturaunts for over 10 years. Good quality sushi at great prices. They are always packed so you know they are doing it right. They are also very creative and come up with their sushi rolls. Jackie (head sushi chef) does a great job of crafting his own rolls. Also, go for one of their Bento Boxes as well. Generous portion and it comes with a lot of items for a good price."}
{"text":"Never enjoyed sushi before, but wife loves sushi, heard this place has some of the best sushi so took the Wifey for a date night.  They did not disappoint! Really enjoyed it, really small inside but nice setup, and food was great.  Started with the chicken lettuce wraps which were awesome then we had some spicy shrimp tempura rolls, now that's some sushi I can get into! Glad we finally discovered this place..will be back for sure"}
{"text":"This place has amazing sushi. It's a very small place, so I would probably recommend getting takeout and eating at home. We have only ever eaten there 1 time, and it took awhile to get a seat. 

Call ahead and order take out, and bring it home. I usually order the dynamite roll (which is only like $6), and a few others. Easily some of the best sushi in Charlotte."}
{"text":"The menu is huge!!! Tons of rolls! The prices are from 10 years ago! Everything was awesome! Hidden little jem!!! Very fresh inexpensive sushi. Bummed it took me this long to find it since it's 100 yards from my office."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how we discovered this place but I am soooo happy we did!
It's located in a strip mall kind of place but as others have said, don't let that stop you. 
They offer some of the best sushi I've had any where! It's also super affordable! Their rolls tend to be larger than what I've had but so delish! New Zealand also offers some original rolls (or at least new to me).
It is a small restaurant so don't be surprised if there's a wait. It's worth it! 
The staff are quick, efficient and friendly. 
New Zealand Cafe is in our list of must visits when we are in the area!"}
{"text":"Decent sushi but Im a bit weird when it comes to feeling comfortable in spacious settings and this place is way too tight for my taste.  Service was fine and so was the food (nothing to write home about) but I felt that I had about 10 people who I did not know all on my table because its so tight together."}
{"text":"We took a drive to check this place out after hearing about it from friends.  It is extremely affordable when it comes to sushi, hence the 4 stars.  The sushi was good, not amazing, but again, we didn't spent the normal $80 for two people which usually happens with my sushi-obsessed husband.  The best deal here are the meals!  For $6.95 you get your meal (we got chicken teriyaki) which includes actual chicken breast and fresh veggies, rice, salad and two small fried appetizers.  It's served on this giant tray- great value for the money!  If we are in the area we'd go again, but not driving the 20 minutes again."}
{"text":"New Zealand is one of the first restaurants I ever visited in Charlotte. I ate there before I even moved into town officially. 

And no, I'm not sure why it's called New Zealand, as it's clearly a sushi joint...but it's a GOOD sushi joint, and the prices are really good. I've eaten at a few sushi places around Charlotte, and New Zealand is one of my favorites.

I might not be the best sushi evaluator, as I won't eat anything that had a mother. However, I've never eaten anything bad at New Zealand, and I've frequented the place with pleased meat eaters several times. 

My favorites are the seaweed salad and the edamame. They've got some interesting desserts, like the red bean and green tea ice cream. I kind of like the tall tables, too...

One day, I'm going to order one of those giant sushi boats!"}
{"text":"Love it! Excellent place even on a Tuesday night at non-peak time every table was full. Went there a few weeks ago and the two girls serving were attentive and super friendly. Kind of a small place and tucked away near Harris Teeter but absolutely a top contender for sushi in the area!"}
{"text":"I don't know why I don't frequent this place more often, it's literally right across the street from me. Quick, friendly (sometimes a little scarily friendly) service, and inexpensive! Had an Ichiban Spicy Roll last time and it was tasty and spiced with sriracha. Also tried some sort of fried roll with a mayo based sauce, it was just aiite, and the Wasabi Salmon Roll that also had some sort of sauce that included sriracha, also, aiite. 

Overall, pretty good for a sushi place in Charlotte, and just right in the budget range.  

There can be a bit of a wait, even when you call ahead and are told there's no wait."}
{"text":"Wow! New Zealand Cafe at Sardis is a joke! We just walked out. We'd never been before. We got there around 6:45 tonight.The place is tiny and 3 people were ahead of us waiting. They said the wait was 25 mins. At 35 mins we started seeing people that came after us get seated. At 40 mins the host sat his buddies who had just walked up that were not on the list. When I confronted him & said we were leaving he said \"Can I have your name so I can take it off the list\" No apology. No I'll get you a table. I walked off. WORST customer service ever! People like that don't need to have service jobs. This place could have had new customers tonight, but not with unprofessional people like interacting with the customers."}
{"text":"I've heard rumors of a nondescript place around Costwold that served one of the better value sushi around.... they weren't joking. 

New Zealand Cafe is nestled in a strip mall, the dining room is small and the decor is not super inspirational... but when it comes to their sushi they don't mess around. Since it's so small, they only have one sushi chef and it takes them a while to be served, but man is it worth it. The flavors are succinct and as imaginative as some of the other 'fancy' sushi places around, but the value here can't be beat. They are an old friend that you can always come back to for a nice conversation and a good time. 

It's a very casual environment and the service is clean. During lunch try to come early because this place fills up to the gills... I'm sure to visit here again and again..."}
{"text":"What a great find!! This place has amazing sushi at a great price. It is a bit small but the sushi is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Raised in the South Pacific, I saw New Zealand cafe and in my mind I was immediately transported to the islands and I was consuming good ol' island grub. This however was not the case when I walked into New Zealand Cafe. BUT, I was not disappointed, for being from the islands I also enjoy SEAFOOD! And sushi is New Zealand cafe's forte. Great sushi nonetheless. Their service is a little bit slow, but who can complain when their absolutely divine sushi hits your tastebuds. Yum! It's small so you really have to hit it at lunch or early dinner or else you'll be waiting forever. Try the pot stickers and then make your way to the plethora of sushi choices!! See you there."}
{"text":"AMAZING sushi rolls. My favorites here are their tempura rolls or unique creations of the sushi chefs (they have 3 sushi menus...)

My favorites?
Thousand Island, Ichiban Spicy, Spicy Scallop and Supercrunch. These are prepared to perfection and served by their very friendly waitstaff. They know thier NZ sushi--ask them anything!

ALWAYS packed at night, but worth the wait. Small dining room with even smaller sushi bar... but you still get outstanding service."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a delicious steal! Their prices are so low, no wonder it's always packed! Great for a quick bite or take-out. Don't be deterred by the strip mall, the food is great."}
{"text":"*Poor Customer Service. 
They got the order wrong and refused to admit that our order was missing an entire roll when we called back insinuating that we were lying. Sushi was above average but the terrible service left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Cilantro roll is not on the menu but GREAT! Also their \"Thai Hot Sour Soup\" is to die for. Was not impressed with the Mango Chicken platter-- the sauce makes the chicken mushy."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for the first time yesterday after hearing all the hype around this place.  

Not sure if it was an \"off\" day but it was hands down some of the worst service we've ever had, despite ordering nothing cooked (all sushi).  Our entire meal took 2 hours.  There was a 45 minute gap in between our appetizer (soup/salad) and our main entree (sushi).  The restaurant seemed more interested in fulfilling the take-out orders rather than attending to the dine-in customers.  The sushi itself was okay - not totally blown away by it.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Such great sushi, but if you call an order in, double the wait time that they give you. Last time I was here, I overheard a frustrated customer say it was the 3rd time she'd had to wait and wait on a to go order. Now here I stand, about 50 minutes into what was supposed to be a 25 minute wait, crowded against the drink station and hoping my order arrives soon. Miserable! But at least the reward at the end will be good..."}
{"text":"Dropped in this evening for the first time after having a craving for sushi .  After viewing the menu online via phone, I made up my mind.  There were a couple people waiting/hanging outside.  There was a line but it moved quickly.  They take debit and split tenders with cash.  I was told the wait would be 30 mins after I paid.  I used the restroom and sat in a chair in the hallway.  Quickly 30 mins went by and a waitress stopped to ask if I was dining in and I told her I had an order.  I gave her the order number and she never responded back about it.  Yet, she came down the hallway often (backway to kitchen?), checked low drinks at tables, and seated two sets of people from the hallway.  I was sitting in the first chair in the hallway yet felt I wasn't as important since I had takeout.  Then 45mins went by and I got up to ask a waitress passing through the checkout line.  She grabbed my bag which seemed to have been ready for a couple mins or while.  Needless to say the meal was delicious even the Spicy Tuna which was a second choice for a little something extra to complete my meal of the Sweet Dragon.  I brewed some Oolong tea at home.  I will return for the Bento Box but I will call my orders in for now on.  Please call out takeout order numbers or have a waitress notify people when they're order is ready.  I will check for weekly specials and deals.  I hope they'll open a bigger location or second location.  Too small of the business is normally like this."}
{"text":"Get the Garden Salad (bigger salad) with ginger dressing. And any cool roll you'd like. It gets crowded. Perfect spot for that local feel. Its tight though, so watch out for toes and elbows. The younger team of girls seem to help each other. Take out at prime time is a must, really. Reservations; I would. Strip mall look. Miami sushi taste."}
{"text":"I love the sushi here.  It's a bit more expensive than your Harris Teeter fare,  but the taste is a world of a difference away!  I think you really get what you pay for.  The food is okay,  but the sushi is really what sells.  The place is a bit small and very tight especially during peak hours."}
{"text":"Not really a fan of this place it's very small the food isn't good always taste bland and old it's also noisy and dark I've only been here twice but I wouldn't spend my money here ever again"}
{"text":"Do you like eating sushi? Do you like eavesdropping on your neighbor's conversations? If you're looking to do both, New Zealand Cafe will be right up your alley.

Come prepared to wait. The place is small and it's become very popular over the past several years. The sushi chefs behind the counter are rolling like crazy, but there's only so much room. If you're dining as a twosome, you'll be seated in the center section and you'll be within elbow's reach of the diners next to you. If you're lucky, you'll overhear an awkward first date. 

The wait and the cramped quarters are generally worth it -- the sushi is great and it's very inexpensive compared to other places in Charlotte. 

The only thing that keeps me from giving five stars to New Zealand is the accuracy. More than once, I've ordered scallop nigiri (\"hotate gai\") but I've received surf clam nigiri (\"hokki gai\"). Not a complete dealbreaker, but it's an unfortunate repeat issue. 

Overall, this place is great and affordable. Worth a visit for sure, especially before or after going to the movies across the street."}
{"text":"This place has ruined me for all other sushi!! Everywhere else I go, I'm so disappointed that it's not as good as New Zealand Cafe. ;D Yes, the place is tiny and usually packed. (That's part of its charm.) Yes, there is generally a decent wait time for carry out. We call ahead and just add 10 minutes on to whatever estimate they give us, and the timing works out fine. And it is always worth the wait!! We order sushi for our at-home date nights, every time we have something to celebrate, and whenever we have had a rough time of things and need comfort food. Besides my husband, this is the only number I have on speed dial! There are a TON of other sushi options in Charlotte, but none will measure up!"}
{"text":"It might look like a hole in the wall but don't let it fool you-always fresh sushi when I lived in the area I dined here 5 days a week- the seaweed crab salad is always a favorite of mine love the golden crab roll and favorite roll- the plum wine is delicious as well as the fried banana!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Charlotte.  It also routinely takes all awards for it as well.  Not a fancy place.  Make sure to place your carry out order early as the line here can be crazy.  Wait for a table can be ridiculous but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"While the place was super busy and this is a great sign that the food is going to be great, I decided to get something to go. First time here waited at door until I was able to get my to go question answered. Went to register in back where I was promptly ignored by a early thirty thin Asian woman. She continued to ignore me while I waited for her to count money. Then she showed me she could indeed multi task by taking a phone order before she even said hello. 

Might still give it another go, just in case she  was having a bad night."}
{"text":"not happy at all... got my food home .no shrimp sauce and my rice was dry and everything else mushy...i wasted 16.00"}
{"text":"Fresh and fun and tiny and cozy.  Friendly service. Sports tv playing on the screens in the corners. 

Good food, good prices. 

I've had the mango chicken and the bento box with sushi. Very tasty chicken (along with sesame noodles, salad, shrimp, and crab rangoon).  Bento box was a winner as well...the sushi was fabulous and fresh.  First time had the NZ white wine, second time the Kikkoman plum wine. The NZ was especially nice with the mango chicken. 

Eclectic mixture of people both times. I love the mood at this place. Hard to define. Welcoming but not intrusive."}
{"text":"This side of town does not afford many options in terms of Sushi.  Fortunately, we have NZ Cafe tucked away across the street from us.   This tiny place is always packed serving quality sushi at a great price.   We usually get carry out as most nights there is a wait for a table. 

I recommend the spider and sweet dragon rolls.  Definitely two of our favorites.

Our only \"complaint\" would be the size of the place.  It would nice if they could expand a bit to give everyone a little more elbow room."}
{"text":"I loved the sushi so much that I'd like to give 5 stars....but that would be overlooking other factors.  All the chairs there are high...the kind that make your feet dangle over the side as they can't reach the ground.  This is painful for people with certain medical conditions.  My wife was in pain the entire time we were there.

Also, the place was very tightly packed.  The tables were too small to allow you to stretch out at all.

The food was pretty good but I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Amazing!!  Found this hidden treasure after searching for new places to try and I'm so glad we did!!  Fresh and delicious every time!  I drive 40 minutes so I can dine here!  Best sushi in town!!"}
{"text":"Great sushi.  Great prices.  Tiny building.  We ONLY get takeout from New Zealand Cafe, because the inside is crazy small.  Everything we have had has been great.  Salmon and tuna rolls, steamed dumplings, miso soup, and entrees from the grill have all been fresh and delicious.  I highly recommend... just get it to go unless it's like 3:00 on a Tuesday."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi spot in Charlotte. Great customer service super friendly staff!! Give it a try!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is WONDERFUL!  I have been here multiple times and have never been dissatisfied with my service.  My only complaint would be that they are always busy and the seating is very close to other patrons.  Despite this fact, I still love it here!

The food is amazing and hot, the waitresses are amazingly friendly, and they are quick!  I have tried several dishes on their menu and none have been dissatisfying.  My favorite on the menu would be the thai chicken curry.  

The prices aren't bad either.  ;-)"}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi I've had in the Charlotte area! Tiny place and tucked away in a strip mall but you'll be a happy camper that you found it. Very fresh, I know this because it took a bit longer than  most sushi places to get my order (wasabi  tuna roll and yellowtail maki) but well worth the wait. The fish was cold and firm, a must for me to qualify the sushi as \"fresh\"! Some places have \"wimpy\" green wasabi, not this place, it's the very dense kind with a kick. I love the \"sinus clearing\" effect, great pickled ginger too! Very reasonable prices and they have lots of specials and a huge selection of rolls, some are even on a picture menu for the \"novice\" sushi eater. I did not try any of their hot entrees but saw several and they looked like good portions and tasty. The service was excellent, I was kind of in a hurry to get to a movie, they got me my check and cashed out right away when I let them know. I will be back here again soon! Definitely worth checking out :-)"}
{"text":"I hate to write bad reviews, but I am literally blown away with how bad the sushi was from here. My husband has been wanting to try this place for a while, so we took the opportunity to order a bunch of rolls from here since we have family in town. 

First of all, when my husband called to place the order, they told him it would be ready in 15min....which seemed pretty fast for a Saturday night, but whatever. My husband shows up 20min later, only to end up sitting there waiting for the food to be ready for ANOTHER 55min (which means it was an hour and fifteen minutes from when he called, as opposed to the fifteen minutes he was originally told). Sadly, the odd wait and takeout situation wasn't even the worst part.

I've had really great sushi before (at a few different places in Charlotte), and I've also had really bad sushi. Now, I get that sushi taste can be sometimes subjective; but there are some things that everyone can agree are just bad. This food was one of those times. How do you screw up a shrimp tempura roll?? It wasn't even that it was takeout of a fried item, it was clearly WAY over cooked, and had brown avocado. Just nasty. And the rolls we had that contained tuna (or I should say were supposed to contain spicy tuna) actually looked like there was dried cheap canned tuna in them. When you spit a bite of something out, and throw the remaining entire roll into the trash, it's BAD. I've never been so embarrassed about our food choices before, but I was mortified that every persons sushi rolls were basically inedible. We ordered 8 rolls + a bento box...how you can have that bad statistical probability that all of it was that bad? 

Which brings me to my question: how on EARTH were they as busy as they were, and how do they have 4stars on yelp, if their food is this bad?

I'm lost. But you literally couldn't pay me good money to eat here ever again. Sad.

Side note: because I'm desperately trying to find something positive about this place, their side sauces were good. Also, the way that they packaged up our order was very nice."}
{"text":"Good sushi and Bento boxes. My wife is gluten free and always gets the Hibachi Chicken with gluten free soy sauce and substitutes the shrimp tempura with additional California roll."}
{"text":"Have been going here since 2007, sushi is consistently great! Excellent pricing! Love Cathy and Catherine, excellent service even better sushi. Love this place, the food and the staff. (Mexican roll, Favorite roll, Valentine roll...personal favorites)"}
{"text":"I had heard a lot of praise about this place and had been wanting to try it for a while. Unfortunately I will not be returning, as it took us(2 people) nearly 2 hours to complete dinner. We ordered crab salad to start and 4 rolls to split. It took over 30 min for the crab salad to come out and nearly 1.5 hours for the rolls. Being that the place is so small we could easily see the issue, they were filling every single takeout order prior to the dine in orders. We could clearly see the sushi chefs working on nothing but takeout orders. Orders should be filled based on when they hit the system and it blows my mind that they would neglect the customers that chose to dine in. After leaving I scanned the reviews and noticed that this seems to be a common issue here. It's truly unfortunate that they have such a poor system in place because the sushi was actually good and if not for this major issue I would absolutely return."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Charlotte!!! We just moved back from Europe and know fresh sushi. The staff is great too. Must get there early or you'll have to wait - but it's worth the wait!  Light on the rice and heavy on fresh fish :). Only thing I would like to see a change in is a better quality wine selection."}
{"text":"I am not sure where all of the 5 and 4 star reviews are coming from in regards to New Zealand Cafe.  We were told to try this restaurant by numerous people when we moved to the area, they told us it was the best sushi in Charlotte and that we would love it because we love sushi so much.  We tried it two different times, on two different days to be sure of our opinion.  It is not good.  Definitely not the best in Charlotte, or in the area for that matter.  The sushi is huge, HUGE. It is a serious challenge to eat without falling completely apart.  Most of the sushi is rice, not a lot of fish going on.  The salmon was good but the tuna tasted off so we didn't even finish those rolls that had tuna in them.  The restaurant is tiny. We were sat no more than a foot from the people on either side of us, so their conversations were basically our conversations the entire time. We did sit outside the first time but with people waiting it was kind of awkward to have people hovering over us while trying to enjoy the over-riced-over-sized bland sushi.  Other reviewers have mentioned it tastes like grocery sushi, that I agree with.  Maybe the prices draw people in and that's why they think it's great.  Most of the rolls are fried in some way, which is probably necessary because some of the fish simply was not fresh and we could not continue eating it.  The service was not great either time we went, if they change things, perhaps we will try it again, until then, on to the much much better sushi Charlotte has to offer!"}
{"text":"When I first visited Charlotte back in September, this was the first restaurant I visited (seeing its very close to Inner Peaks).

The rolls are cheap/moderately priced, the staff are friendly and the atmosphere is very homey.

The one thing that really stands out is the sushi chef's attention to detail and focus on ACTUALLY giving a dang about presentation. They're also relatively innovative with the rolls offered; my one friend had the Island Roll which was wrapped in cucumber strips rather than seaweed and rice. Pretty rad.

Yeah, I'm pretty sure I'll drop in here quite a bit whenever I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times and I can honestly say that this is a true hidden gem in Charlotte! Some of the freshest sushi and delicious rolls. The inside is very cramped and they are almost always on a wait but the prices are affordable and the the quality is good. Try the $1 Sushi pieces if you like Nigiri."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of my favorite sushi spots in Charlotte. It's easy, not stuffy, and consistent. My entire family loves New Zealand."}
{"text":"This place is great! I used to think it was my own little secret, but it is always packed...guess the secret is out! I don't like shshi, but if you do, this place is for you. They have all of the classics, and on Tuesdays its all $1. I love the teriyaki chicken,  garlic noodles, brown rice, and love the fries shrimp! I've never dined in, but get to-go often. The food is always fresh amd always meets my expectations. If you find yourself near the corner of Monroe Rd and Sardis Rd N, you should stop in! It is hidden in the Harris Teeter shopping center."}
{"text":"I love all the sushi I've tried here. It's a smaller restaurant but it's very good! Reasonable priced rolls!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love coming here for date night!! The food is cheap, fresh and delicious! If your looking to avoid the swanky restaurant scene, I would highly recommend coming here. New Zealand Cafe offers a laid back atmosphere. The staff is very attentive to customers with allergies. Sadly my husband is allergic to shellfish, so he switches ingredients like shrimp for Imitation crab. I'm happy to report he's never had an outbreak here, and he loves the food. 

I wouldn't recommend coming here for dinner, unless it's durning the weekday. Considering the restaurant is small, it's difficult to get a table. We typically arrive 10mins after they open, or order food to go.

I hope New Zealand Cafe opens another location one day!"}
{"text":"I have very mixed feelings about this place. I love sushi and think the sushi here is pretty good and the rolls are creative. However, the place is realllly small and cramped and the service dining in is mediocre. Take out service is awful, they tell you 25 minutes on the phone and you end up waiting up to (or even longer than) an hour. Last time I was here I waited for my take out order over an hour and when I asked for a second time if it would be much longer (politely, but I'm sure you could detect slight irritation in my voice) I was told very rudely that it would come out soon and to sit down and wait......like excuse me? At least apologize that I've been here for over an hour...or just don't snap at me! Personally, I would rather go somewhere with decent food and better atmosphere."}
{"text":"Who knew? This little gem is tucked away in the Harris Teeter shopping center in Matthews. It's small but apparently regulars know about it - there was a wait at 6pm on a Thursday! Chilly outside temps meant our table by the door was rather unfortunate with so many people coming & going & holding the door open for extended lengths of time. Brrrr!

Now, I should point out that this place is known for their sushi. I don't each fish - raw or otherwise, so I can't speak to what they're known for; other than to say my friends all raved about the Tiger Roll & Christmas Roll. I did, however, order the Daily Vegetable Special and the Vegetable Tempura rolls. This was my first time trying anything remotely sushi-related and my first time eating with chopsticks (they don't readily provide forks!! Well, they might if you NEED one and ask for it.) Our food was served in a very elaborate wooded boat, which was fun. The servers were very quick with our drink orders & refills.

I thought the food was flavorful & fresh. I'd skip the fried bananas & bananas sushi for dessert, but others seemed to enjoy the green tea ice cream for something unusual.

Next time, I'll probably try one of their pork or chicken meals for what seemed like a larger portion at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"We got a pretty good selection of different rolls - it was just OK it wasn't special and it definitely wasn't fabulous so I can honestly say we won't be back"}
{"text":"I'm going to give this place a 4.5 and an extra .5 star for the wait staff enthusiasm.  Have to agree with most of the reviews of this place since it is very unassuming and located in a strip mall.  The place has a lot of charm and personality and I am really glad it is in my neck of the woods.  I can totally see myself becoming a regular here.

I had the Tuna Crunchy Roll and the Sweet Dragon Roll which were both outstanding for the price.  We did have a little bit of a wait because there was a huge sushi order prior to ours... It was pretty amazing to see 4-5 sushi boats filled to the brim be delivered over to a 4 person table.  They ended up not finishing everything and having 3 full size take home boxes of sushi!  Maybe they were bringing them over to an adult baseball league afterwards...  It was a ton of sushi. 

Can't wait to go back and sample more rolls and maybe a bento box or 30.  The menu took a while to read through, but I'm sure all the options are just as good as what I ordered.

The wait-staff was very warm and inviting... one of the waitresses in particular recognized some regulars and it was hard not to be swept up in her enthusiasm.  Definitely hard to find positive people like that now a days especially in a tough position serving others."}
{"text":"My all-time favorite sushi place! I think they've been voted one of the best sushi places in Charlotte for a long time now. I'm never dissatisfied and it's always delicious. The only negative thing is the dining room is tiny but we always get takeout anyways. If it's on the weekend be ready to wait! They're good."}
{"text":"This is our go-to place. The sushi is always amazing. They also have really great chinese-style stir fries that are great for people who aren't fans of sushi. The staff is great, and it's a cozy place. Always busy so give yourself extra time in case there's a wait."}
{"text":"Best Sushi in Charlotte! Good for SMALL groups. Very very small restaurant, always crowded. But the food is so worth the hassle. I don't go anywhere else anymore. Be prepared to have a wait and to be sitting close to other people and have your taste buds blown away!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is remenicent of back alley food truck. At lunch the service is super slow, if you get your food at all. The sushi tastes somewhere between grocery store and buffet with the grocery store being the better of the two. Will not be eating here again and I hope I do not have food poisoning.
Just to update...my girlfriend and I both have food poisoning."}
{"text":"Guess they are so busy they dont need new customers. Took my daughter to lunch had our name on the list sat and waited for a table and they seat 2 tables who just walked in before us after waiting 25 mins. Really? Thanks we were looking for a good place but weather the foods worth it or not customer service is needed i my opinion."}
{"text":"Friendly service.  Americanized Indonesian entrees.  Average sushi with above average presentation.  Dressings and sauces 2 stars.  Not a bad place but not some place I would go out of my way to visit."}
{"text":"Teeny tiny, and in a strip shopping center...don't let that stop you from experiencing fabulous food. My neighbors from South Africa discovered it...my first clue that it was going to be great. They have excellent and out-of-the-ordinary taste in food. Good service in small space. Really odd atmosphere, but tons of delicious food. It will take you 10 minutes to read the menu and decide. It's extensive!! Sushi, teriyaki, stir fry, vegetarian, seafood, beef, chicken, platter...holy cow!!! We do a LOT of takeout. Best fried rice in town. You sit RIGHT next to your neighbor, kind of like a exotic neighborhood diner."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of state.  A couple of friends wanted to eat here. I thought ok. The waiter wasn't friendly at all. Didn't seem to know much about the menu.  Seemed to be annoyed because I wanted to do a substitute.  Food came out.  The teriyaki chicken was coated very well in the sauce.  I wouldn't comeback."}
{"text":"This place has gone down. From the mediocre place it had before. The food isn't good at all save your money and the time it takes to get in there."}
{"text":"I am always in search of a great sushi place with fresh fish and decent prices and I was really hoping NZ Cafe would fit the bill. We walked in and the place was absolutely slammed for a Monday, so that was a great sign.

The seating is a bit too close for comfort in my opinion- conversations next to us were distracting as I am sure we were to others as well. Service was poor and slow . We had two servers (I think?), my point is that I really had no idea who our actual server was.

we ordered four rolls:

christmas, sweet dragon, crazy, and discovery


We only really cared for two out of four (s.d and christmas) - disovery was one of the worst rolls I have ever had - very fishy tasting and honestly sloppy.I had an issue with the overall temperature of all the rolls - very warm and the avocado on the rolls was a mushy mess.

 We must have read the menu wrong because we thought we were getting three unfried rolls and one fried but two ended up being over-fried almost to the point where they lost any of the delicateness of sushi. Lastly I am a big fan of wasabi and tend to add quite a bit to my low sodium soy, but they must have super-salty wasabi paste because it was almost inedible....and not spicy enough. 

On a positive note the wooden boat displays were a really cool idea and certainly warranted us taking a few photos. 

Overall though, the distance and quality make this a no-go for me ..."}
{"text":"This may be the best sushi I've had in Charlotte. I stopped by with a friend for lunch and surprised to find the place not too overly packed. We ordered a few sushi rolls were presented well and tasted great. I saw some of the other customers order bento boxes for lunch. Will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"I have a confession... I'm slightly obsessed with sushi . 

My husband and I were in the area for dinner.  We walk into New Zealand and there is a line waiting to be seated.  This is on a Monday night.  That is a strong testament to how good this place is.

I was told there was a 20 minute wait.  I asked the hostess if I could place my sushi order so it would be ready when the table was ready and she said sure!!  She even brought drinks to us while we were waiting.

Our table was actually ready way quicker than she thought!

Our sushi took a while to come out because they were so busy!

Everything was delicious.  We devoured it quickly!  We ordered the valentine roll, the Christmas roll, and the favorite roll. 

My favorite was the valentine roll.  I highly recommend New Zealand if you aren't in a rush for lunch/dinner.  The prices are also very reasonable."}
{"text":"There is no better sushi in this area of Charlotte.  Period.

When we lived in Elizabeth on the east side of uptown Charlotte, we would sometimes drive all the way to New Zealand Cafe simply because the sushi is that good, and the prices are low!  If you live in this area or just happen to be in the area and surfing Yelp for where to grab a bite, you have to try New Zealand Cafe!.

Very good sushi and extremely great pricing."}
{"text":"This is the sushi spot I have been looking for since moving to Charlotte a year and a half ago!!! I am so glad someone gave my boyfriend a tip to try this place out. We went on a Sunday night and it was packed!! It's tiny and we had to wait for a table. I will say as much as we enjoyed the sushi, the dining experience was a little uncomfortable because the tables were so close we were basically sitting with two other couples and the servers could barely get around. 

The rolls are so cheap! I think the most expensive one was $11. We got four and enjoyed them all besides the hot tuna, just not our style. Favorite was the big boss roll! Everything tasted fresh and of good quality. 

Will definitely be back the next time we want sushi. You get twice as much for the money here than other places I have been in Charlotte and it tastes just as good, if not better!"}
{"text":"After all these years working in the area and living not far away, and even being told to make it to New Zealand, I never had done so.  One day, we decided to pop in, and who should be there but Julia S.?  Sometimes things just work out that way.

First, do not expect a lot from the atmosphere.  You are in a strip mall, after all, and you have to dig somewhat to find the place - but once inside, you get maybe a dozen tables, and it can get cramped since they get a bit busy.

Service is good, however, and the food is good too.  I really cannot comment on the sushi itself, as I am not much of an expert, but I find that it is better than some (Ru San's), and perhaps not as good as others (Osaka).  There are some cool options (the boat was a neat touch).  You also get a lot of food for the price.  Definitely worth checking out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Awesome food but I always have order to go because it is so congested and small! No comfortable waiting space either so I sit in my car until my food is ready... so unfortunate... if they get a bigger space,  I would definitely give them give stars because the food is THAT good!"}
{"text":"This was my second visit here , dont let the outside fool you its a hole in the wall lol The food is amazing you can get Sushi or Bento box an its much food an such a great price.  My friend ordered the sushi she loved it an I had bento box with sweet n sour chicken, crab ragon, salad, egg roll I ate it all lol  The staff is very friendly they also have a small bar. If your in the area make a stop you wont regret it."}
{"text":"We came to check out New Zealand Cafe based on the great reviews. I had my doubts once we pulled down a long road of dead strip malls. The restaurant was busy so I figured, \"hey, maybe it's ok?\" Turns out our rolls were nothing special and not worth the drive. They were big and hard to eat. The search for a place better than RuSan continues!"}
{"text":"I am a rookie to sushi, but this place is very good and has an great menu selection.  Don't let it's location in a strip mall fool you, it's a very popular place so expect having to wait for a table."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi place in Charlotte. The problem is there is hardly any seating and the wait is very long! However, it is worth it. They have a large variety of options! I wouldn't waste my time on anything other than sushi if I were you. Also, the prices are very reasonable. Be prepared, it can get quite crowded! It has a very \"whole in the wall\" vice though."}
{"text":"Worst sushi place I've ever been to. The service took so long , my toddler started getting uncomfortable because he was hungry and the food just took way too long to arrive. Ones the food arrived it was terrible , my sushi just fell apart every time I tried picking it up and they didn't set the table appropriately , we had to continuously ask them for napkins , straws and chopsticks. The service and food completely sucked. We were a group of 4 and we all hated it ."}
{"text":"New Zealand Cafe?  The name totally confused me when I visited a business a few doors down to get some signs made.  I thought \"what do they eat in Australia?\"  Then a friend suggested that I try it out for sushi.  I don't so sushi so again, went about life.  

Well, I've tried it now twice and while I haven't tried the sushi, the other dishes are great.  This place is pretty cool.  It's in a divey plaza wedged into the corner next to a take out chinese place and something else on the other side.  They have a sushi bar and about a hand full of high top 4 place tables and a few lower ones in the middle.  I've been in larger walk-in closets.  

The food is good...really good.  I ordered a lettuce wrap and it was exactly what I wanted.  Why can't more places do a decent lettuce wrap?

The hibachi chicken was a little unexpected.  It came in a bento box-like contraption with rice in the corner, the chicken the veg in the center, more chicken on skewers, salad in another corner and even two crab rangoons (I guess - who knows how it's spelled...and I know what you're thinking \"Why not just use google to find out how to spell it!...\"  I just did and it is rangoon\".

You sushi people, don't fret. I'm sure someone else had that and thought it was good.  If you order a lot of sushi, they bring it out in a boat which is pretty cool.  

I grew up thinking that Japanese food required a bunch of pageantry and pantomime but I don't want that.  I want some rice or noodles, some lettuce and veg that's crisp and some meat prepared properly.  This place get's it for me.  Definitely one to put in the rotation."}
{"text":"The space is very small and tightly cramped! I always get my food To-Go and call ahead. It's usually ready within 20 minutes. This place is always busy. The sushi is amazing and I've been here several times now. The prices are very good for sushi. The hibachi is also good!"}
{"text":"Don't let the 4-star review fool you, this is my favorite sushi spot in Charlotte. I've been here several times, and will say that this place stays consistently excellent. 

Although you may be tempted to go for the bento / cooked food - it tends to be way more affordable - stay true and stick to the sushi! The magic of NZC truly lies in their rolls. You can't really go wrong with whatever you choose, but my recommendations include the following:

-Negi Hamachi: Classic, delicious.
-Super Spicy Roll: Spicy yellow tail, tuna, salmon, avocado, smelt roe 
& scallions
-Favorite Roll: Tempura shrimp, snow crab, avocado, spicy mayo, wrapped in soybean paper :)

This place is boss, give it a visit!"}
{"text":"Definitely the best Sushi (so far) in NC. I've had amazing Sushi/Sashimi back in NYC so I might be a little jaded with what's here in NC. I will definitely say that this place is my goto for Japanese! Still very trendy and crowded, so plan to wait."}
{"text":"Loved the sushi. Very fresh and delicious. Great prices. Wish we had one in my hometown. I would eat here every week!!!"}
{"text":"After reading a ton of great reviews on this teeny little sushi spot, hubs and I just had to make the trip down to New Zealand Cafe. We're both sushi fanatics, loving (and eating) everything from yellowtail sashimi to creative maki rolls. 

NZ Cafe really is tucked away from the street - hidden in a strip mall off of Sardis Rd. The inside is interesting and super small. When we stopped by here we counted roughly 40 possible seats in the place - and that would be a tight fit! Regardless, we were able to grab a four-top and sit comfortably while we perused their menu(s). 

And what a menu it was! We were each given four different menus: one solely for sushi, one dinner menu, a specials menu and one other blue menu that I didn't even get a chance to look at. I was a bit overwhelmed! The service was attentive and friendly and our waitress was please to offer up a few suggestions from their specialty roll menu. Here is what we went with:

Steamed Potstickers (Pork): Six tasty postickers served with a nice, light soy sauce. These potstickers were nicely flavored, especially with the sauce. 

*I'm not a roe fan, so we chose to abstain from all fish roe from every roll. 

Dynamite Roll: Spicy yellowtail, crab and avocado. While I wasn't super impressed for this roll (a bit mushy and lacking flavor), it was $4.95. That's a steal in anyone's book.

Tuna Crunchy Roll: I really wanted to love this roll, but it was just way too fried for my taste. The outside was super crunchy, stiff and too heavy. Plus, the roll came out piping hot and I'm not a fan of hot tuna rolls. 

Pink Roll: Tempura shrimp, spicy tuna, cod wrapped in soy paper. This was a pretty good roll but HUGE! So large that I had to gnaw off half at a time. I'm sure that looked super hot. 

Ichiban Roll: Spicy albacore tuna, crab, avocado, topped with
spicy tuna and wasabi mayo with a dash of Sriracha on top. I liked the flavor of this roll quite a bit, as it's definitely got a kick. I wish it had a little more texture, though. Maybe some crunchies on top would help? 

While I definitely see the appeal of New Zealand Cafe, the cheap rolls, generous portions and creative combinations, it didn't blow me away like I thought it would. Considering it's a bit of a hike from my house, I'm not sure I'll be coming back often, but I definitely want to give this little gem another try in the near future."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite sushi restaurant.  The only problem I have with New Zealand Cafe is that I spend too much of my paycheck there and eat until I'm busting.  Food is great as well as the service.  Can't wait until my wife delivers the baby so we can get back to our weekly ritual."}
{"text":"We love this place. Hands down the most amazing albacore and hamachi nigiri. Their house salad dressing is to die for, delicious miso, the prices couldn't be better. We love everything we've tried. When we feel like sushi, this is our spot."}
{"text":"I posted a review about this place before, but after going last night for the 3rd day in a row... YES it's that good... I had to post more. 

I've come to realize that New Zealand will always have a wait when you get there, no matter what time of day. The reason, it's THAT good. People have waited 30 minutes or longer for a table at this place. I should know because I am one of those people, and I'd wait even longer if I had to just to get inside to eat. 

For those who are hungry now, call in a take out order, that way you can run inside to grab your grub and be on your way. I just love this place, and every time I've gone I've gotten the same thing. I order a tray with the honey chicken and shrimp & it's enough to make me start drooling at my desk just thinking about it again. 

Well, last night I decided to go to try the sushi after my friend twisted my arm a bit. She said, \"You can't go to New Zealand and not try the sushi!!!\" I informed her that, yes I could, and I did it often. But, she was right. 

I ordered a tasty roll, which is salmon, cream cheese, and some other concoctions lightly fried. I almost fell backwards in my chair and passed out because the taste punched me in my face. God parted the clouds and a beam of light blew up my taste buds when that sushi entered my body. I swear to you, I've NEVER had better sushi than this in my life... and I'm a gal who enjoys her sushi. 

I'm convinced that there is nothing bad you can order on their menu. It is just insane how good the food is here. The prices are beyond reasonable, the taste is fantastic, obviously and it's in a close proximity to my house. But if it weren't I wouldn't care, I'd drive an hour to eat here. Oh New Zealand, I heart you a bunch."}
{"text":"Hmmmm...I was hoping for better.  Much better.  It was lunch and the place was slammed.  So excited to try some good sushi.  Was rushed to the bar.  Was rushed with the menu.  Had some questions and was rushed through those.  Hmmm....not yet impressed.

No lunch specials really for sushi.  There are Bento boxes but they are about $13 for ones that include sushi.  So I ordered two rolls including a basic spicy tuna.  

One person making sushi....it took a while.  Got my order and the spicy sauce on the tuna was a mayo based sauce.  In 20 years of eating sushi I have never had a mayo sauce on spicy tuna.  Also it wasn't very spicy.  Also was rather warm for sushi.  Rice was good.  

I think this place may be a good intro to sushi but not for the seasoned fans.

Hmmm...I was hoping for better."}
{"text":"Great fresh sushi, over-sized meal options and great service. I lean towards the chicken and shrimp hibachi. The meal comes with a salad, rice/noodles/chicken kabob and 2 yummy crab rangoons. My husband always opts for the sushi and we share our meals. This place is always packed so we try to get there at non-peak times. Will always be back!"}
{"text":"Another on my list of \"how have I not reviewed this yet?\"

It's easy to pass this place, or to confuse it for the Best Wok next door. New Zealand Cafe is a tiny parcel in a crowded strip mall that is serving incredible Kiwi-inspired Japanese dishes at amazing prices. The bento box is by far the best deal. It's all from the grill (instead of the customary sushi), but you get an unbelievable amount of tasty food for about $10.

Speaking of sushi, they work wonders. They have a sushi bar, where you can dine in front of the chefs and watch them work - their grace and elegance is worth the visit.

Do be advised that take-out is usually be best option. It's very small and quite \"cozy\" inside - if you have one of the low, square tables in the middle, odds are good you'll get to know your neighbors.

Don't let that deter you though - great Asian-fusion at the Galleria!"}
{"text":"Not sure how this place doesn't have 5 stars. The sushi is hands down the best in town and they have the awards and praise posted on their walls to prove it. Not a whole lot of seating area and the place is small, but I think that is what makes this place just a cool little hole in the wall with 5/5 sushi."}
{"text":"The sushi here is always fresh and delicious.  Not crazy about there entries. There spicy tuna roll is jam packed with tasty tuna. Very good sushi bar."}
{"text":"i love this little place.  And I do mean little!! The menu is twice the size of the restaurant.  But it's a great place to load up on affordable sushi.  The servers are always super friendly."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch location - quick and really spot-on sushi and nigiri. The Century Roll and Unagi were particularly tasty."}
{"text":"I'm not an expert on sushi but this is the best that I have had. The other items on the menu are original and delicious. Friendly staff and good service. You should go!"}
{"text":"This is a great sushi place in Charlotte! I'm so sad I only discovered this place after 15 years of living here... Anyway, I wouldn't say this spot is a secret - it gets super busy. And by super, I mean a 2 hour wait on a Wednesday night. Well, technically it was like an hour wait to even get seated. Once inside, I realized that this place is pretty small and cozy, so seating is limited. We chose to sit at the bar because spots opened up. We ordered 4 rolls to share amongst 5 people. Our server was friendly but it still took a long time for food to come.. almost an hour I'd say. It was interesting to see the talented and very speedy sushi chefs crank out rolls, but at the same time it was sad just wondering if they were finally making ours and watching the plates being whisked away. I think they felt bad that we were waiting so long, so they put 4 of our rolls onto a sushi boat without us asking. I think my favorite roll was the big boss roll (it's their most popular one), and the discovery roll was also good. All the rolls were unique and flavorful. I never really tend to opt for the more traditional options so I can't really speak to those. Their selection is quite expansive. 
Honestly, this place should expand to a bigger space - I think that's their main problem right now. I would come back again in a heartbeat, but I'd advise coming here early or else you'll likely be hangry like us. Quite a few people called and got their order to-go, which is also a smart move."}
{"text":"Wouldn't have thought to go in here for sushi, but on the recommendation of several friends we tried it, and the food is fantastic.  Also, I personally find the small and slightly unfinished dining area welcoming, and for a Sushi place, very unique."}
{"text":"Had the lunch at new zealand cafe one Saturday lunch.  Sat in front of the chef at the sushi bar.  

After 10 mins of studying the menu, those pictures  does do a good illustration on their gigantic menu.  Tuna toro not available on the date we visit.

We order nothing but nigiri.  I hate rolls, especially those with all the sauces covering the rolls, that has no way to show the quality of the fish in there.

These are what we have strong comments on:

Marugai (geoduck), they gave us the tsubugai (conch).
Hotate (scallop) was yellowish in color and dried. 
Uni was bitter and brownish in color, very fishy smell.  (That indicates how long it has been sitting in their cooler)
Others are not memorable, but overall is below average in freshness.

The waitress (owner) shows no interests in talking or having eye contact with customers.  Had yelled at the wait staffs couple of times.

The whole experience should warrant a 2 or 3 stars review.

But, the worst part was I had the diarrhea in the next two days.

I wish there is one decent quality sushi place in Union county."}
{"text":"The tuna sushi made me sick. However overall it was great. I would advise you not to eat tuna sushi."}
{"text":"Best sushi we've found... Maybe ever! Big creative rolls & always great quality! The space is a little small, so there's often a wait, but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's my favorite sushi restaurant. It's small, but that makes it more intimate and not full of people. The food is delicious and the service is great. It can be a little bit expensive for me, but that's normal with sushi."}
{"text":"Their fresh, melt-in-your mouth Uni and beautiful Toro are always a favorite. The servers at this place are absolutely wonderful. The sushi chefs at this place really are artists!

The wait can be very long with no place to wait but outside because of the small dining room. Hopefully the owners will see their success as an opportunity to expand so the diners aren't so cramped. Also, the wine list really needs a makeover.

The Uni is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Waited for a long time but when the food came my spicy tuna sushi was very dry and not spicy at all. Pretty disappointed because a girl referred us to it. Plus my husbands sushi was not good and the spicy mayo is gross and thick"}
{"text":"Oof.  Came here on the high opinions of others, but found the sushi to be severely disappointing.

Buddies and I ordered a boatload of sushi and most, if not all, was not fresh.  It was on the cheaper Monday night and I'm assuming that the reason it's priced so low is because it is the leftover sushi from the high volumes they probably move on the weekend.  It only makes sense that they charge like a dollar for a piece bc the sushi isn't as fresh.

I probably won't be back bc I really wanted good sushi and didn't like it very much here.  If there are other recommendations, pls suggest away.

dmo out."}
{"text":"This place is great! We come here often, never had a bad experience. The food is consistent. The sushi is what this place is known for, but do not sleep on the bento boxes. They are under $8, for a nice combination of food.  New Zealand is really small, so get here early or be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Great spot for inexpensive lunch or dinner.  Try the combo bento boxes- hard deal to beat.  Great, fresh sushi as well and super friendly staff!  Come early or late, or be prepared to wait!  This place is no secret!"}
{"text":"We had been looking for a place that provides fresh sushi like we had back in our home state, and this place was \"close\". It is undeniable that New Zealand Cafe is a very busy and popular restaurant. But \"busy\" is not always a good sign; sometimes it just means there are a lack of other restaurants of high quality. Such is the case with New Zealand Cafe. It is a good restaurant with good food, but it stops there.

The food seemed fresh, but it was not like, \"oh my God this is so fresh!\" kind of feel. When you taste really fresh food, your taste buds will scream for joy! Again, food was good, but not \"OMG I can't wait for another bite!\".

I wanted to give this place five stars, but it fell short in a couple of areas: (1) service was fast, but not friendly; (2) if you like fake crab meat in your sushi, this is your place; (3) the soda dispensing machine is right next to the bar and some tables; this is constantly in use, inhibiting your privacy at your table plus the fact that constantly falling ice is noisy. It should be re-located away from the customers' dining experience.

I would not say the restaurant fell flat. Rather, it fell short of what we had hoped and read. If more sushi places were available, I don't think New Zealand Cafe would be as busy as it was, unfortunately."}
{"text":"There's absolutely nothing I haven't enjoyed here , fresh , tasteful, yummy Japanese . Love the Bento boxes and it's just the right amount to satisfy your craving ."}
{"text":"Hidden in a quiet shopping mall is a bustling sushi place that has boomed tremendously. I've always wanted this place to be my little secret but obviously its popularity has made it one of the best sushi places in the city. 

It's nearly impossible to get a table here for dinner on the weekends; everyone is waiting outside. Hence, I try to come here for lunch (since they offer the same menu anyways). I always get the same things: vegetable tempura, salmon skin hand roll, and the boss roll. Oh yeah, the boss roll is my favorite. Great flavors with lightly battered tempura shrimp inside that's still crispy when they serve it to you. They are also very generous with the amount of salmon skin that they give you in their rolls.

Would I come back here again? Most definitely. The service here is outstanding as well and even though they're very busy, they make sure you're enjoying your meal and your drinks are refreshed. While I understand it's not Jiro's or any other fancy sushi hotspots, it is one of the best in Charlotte. Before you leave, you must try the fried ice cream as well! Crispy on the outside but chill and creamy in the inside."}
{"text":"By far, the best sushi in Chsrlotte. In terms of variety, quality and price it TOWERS head and shoulders above the rest. Fyi, usually a wait at dinner time. Their quality holds up for to go orders as well.  2 people can eat very well here for around $40, which is a steal compared to some places and their $20 rolls."}
{"text":"This place is one of the best sushi restaurants in Charlotte, and I have tried a lot of them. It may look kinda sketchy on the outside, but it is mucho bueno!  The place is pretty small, and sometimes you have to wait a bit, but believe me when I tell you it's worth the wait. Recommend the \"boss roll\".... Yum, yum and yum. Everything I have ever ordered here has always been great, I am never disappointed. Service is ok, friendly staff. I highly recommend this place. Very fresh sushi ."}
{"text":"Sushi was really good.  The place is a little small.  The sushi was fresh, the service was pretty good.  There was a 5 minute wait on a Wednesday around 7:45.  I would go back again"}
{"text":"Plan to arrive early if you want to grab a table, particularly on a weekend, because New Zealand Cafe does great business. Yes, it is in a strip mall, and no, the ambiance doesn't draw you in, but the fresh sushi and range of rolls sure does. The pricing is more than fair although I can't say that I've tried the $1 rolls. Seems a little risky to me unless you are vying for a sick day from work. I'm a sucker for a good caterpillar roll always as well as anything involving unagi, and there are plenty of eel options. My mister tried some tuna sashimi when we were there last, and it was outrageously good."}
{"text":"I have NO idea why people are raving about this place!  It may be cheap, but it is NOT good sushi.  It is not fresh, it is not cold, it is just not good sushi.  It may be the worst sushi rolls that I have ever had.  I would not go back here!!"}
{"text":"I can't up sale this place enough. I love this place. Awesome sushi. Great owners. Never had a bad meal or a bad time. Even the ToGo food is on point. Always busy. Fish is always fresh and delicious. Great neighborhood spot. Always busy so plan accordingly. Jackie is the man"}
{"text":"We went here after eating (bad food...kingz) at another restaurant, the waitstaff immediately seated us and said hello, took our  orders, they are awesome, the food came out in a timely manner and everything was tasty and seasoned properly, great little place,only down side tables are close and hallway to bathrooms is tight"}
{"text":"If you are looking for affordable sushi, this is the place. With that being said, the quality is okay. You get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"I am a bit of a sushi-head and in my opinion they have the best sushi in the Charlotte area! I kind of like that it is a hole in the wall type of place but at the same time wish they would buy out the place next to them and and make it larger. My #1 place to go when craving sushi!!!"}
{"text":"Consistently fresh food--everything from the sushi rolls to the seaweed salad to my mom's chicken teriyaki entree--at awesomely affordable prices.

I have yet to try their sashimi, which I'm hesitant to order at new places, but based on quality of dishes thus far, I'm excited to explore unchartered territory on my next visit.

Bonus points for friendly staff and speedy service, even when New Zealand Cafe has been packed."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem!! I love the food, service, and prices!! They give you a free meal on your birthday! I will definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Sushi is great! But the wait is crazy long even if you call in for carry out. Dine in is hard because it's always jammed and you have to shuffle around people. If you have small children, you probably can't eat here because the tables are really jammed close together and they don't have booster seats available. Most tables are bar stool height, so it would be really hard to eat as a family here unless you have bigger children."}
{"text":"I love the sushi here. My two favorites are the bigger roll and the super spicy roll. Decent price for the two rolls. I dine in every now and then but its more convenient for me to order to go. Its always busy here so you have to catch it before rush hour."}
{"text":"I just wanted to update my review by letting everyone know that not only is this the best sushi in Charlotte but some of the best in the country. Jackie is the man at making mind blowing sushi creations. Don't let the strip mall that this place is located in or the size of New Zealand Cafe deter you. All the people you'll see waiting for a table should be a good indication of just how good this sushi is. If you don't want to wait for a table I would highly recommend going early (before 6:30) or later (around 8:30). It is definitely worth your time to experience some of the best sushi around these parts!"}
{"text":"I love their food, not a fan of their location. Its always super crowded and seating is just horrible. But I do have to say that the food is ridiculously amazing. I really do love coming here for the food and only for that reason. I wish they could relocate and get something bigger. You cant even walk in there. But everything I have eaten there is just to die for. Amazing food!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been coming here for about 3 years. We have only had one bad experience here and it was with a new and inexperienced waitress at the dinner rush. The food lives up to its expectations and is well worth the wait(sometimes up to an hour/hour and a half at the dinner rush). Staff is always friendly and helpful. The atmosphere is amazing and if you sit at a low top table most of the time someone next to you will start up a conversation. Some of our favorite rolls are: the valentine roll, the favorite roll, ichiban spicy roll, wasabi salmon roll, and spider roll. The potstickers and ahi tuna are great starters as well! Pictures of our various favorites(and other great rolls as well) will be attached!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here well over two dozen times.  The prices are great, service is fast and friendly, and the sushi is great.  When they bring you 3 menus for food, one a huge laminated menu with pictures of some rolls, you know there's bound to be something good awaiting your selection.  I notice that around lunch, if you are not seated by noon, it may be hard to get a table - so duck out a little early.  They have sushi and other Asian food.  I see a lot of folks getting Bento boxes, but I only eat the sushi so can't comment on them."}
{"text":"We have been here numerous times, the sushi is very good and the prices are fair. So why not 5 stars? 

While the food and prices are good this by far is one of the most uncomfortable restaurants I've ever eaten in. If you are seated in the strip of tables down the middle of the place you are literally shoulder to shoulder with the other people seated next to you.  Everyone is on top of each other, there is no room. It's so small people wait outside for their name to be called for a table. No big deal unless it's 40 degrees outside like last Friday. People stand there with the door open to give the hostess their name, people are constantly coming in and out getting takeout, the hostess holds the door open while calling out names to be seated and so on and so on. It's like sitting outside and it's ridiculous. 

As much as we like the food the actual setup of the restaurant is just plain awful to the point that it's just going to be take out from here on out."}
{"text":"Sushi is my favorite food, and being new to Charlotte, I relied on Yelp to give me some recommendations. Therefore, I gave New Zealand Cafe a shot, despite the already questionable restaurant name.

I suppose it is unfair since I am comparing my experiences to sushi restaurants in Los Angeles and Boston (hometown and schooltown), so I will just cover the things that should NEVER happen at a sushi restaurant just to be fair.

1. If you are going to be a sushi waitress, please pronounce the menu correctly! Tuna is said, MAguro, not maGURO. Please get the inflection right.

2. When ordering nigiri, it should not turn into an order of sashimi and rice. Nigiri means sashimi STICKS to the rice, which = not falling apart.

3. It is very unappetizing to see blood from your sashimi on your dish.

4. Green tea from a tea bag? Really?

5. If you offer fried ice cream (I'm assuming this is tempura?), why does it only come in vanilla when you have green tea and red bean on the ice cream menu as well?

See, I haven't even got into the freshness of the sushi (which not all of it was made to order since I sat at the sushi bar) or the sashimi, or any complicated standards that I usually have. I am sorry, if this is the best sushi in Charlotte, because it was the worse sushi I have ever had, then I suppose it says a lot about the food scene.

If anyone has any recommendations for sushi, please please please send me a message!"}
{"text":"This happens to be my favorite sushi spot in Charlotte! It's a small little place but it's definitely a hidden gem in this area! I always get the teriyaki beef bento box & philly roll! It's always perfect for me!!!"}
{"text":"This place has great Sushi at very affordable price.  I have not found other Sushi place that serves quality Sushi cheaper than this place.  Service is nice and personable.  The place is tiny so be prepared to wait (worth waiting) or order to-go (call in advance).  I have never had a bad experience at this place.  Don't let the location or the name to fool you.  It is a great place."}
{"text":"This was a win for us. We recently went here because it seemed like a good compromise for us (I like sushi and my fella likes more stir fry / Chinese dishes). We got there and were sat at one of the tiny tables in the middle of the restaurant. I felt really close to the people next to us but was okay with it. We got there just in time because there ended up being a wait and quite a bit of congestion with to go orders. 

We started with pan fried potstickers. Only one side of the potstickers were crunchy and the other side had a steamed consistency.  I liked them and my boyfriend thought they were just okay. For our meals, I ordered the tasty roll and big boss roll. My boyfriend got the fried pork chop meal. I loved the big boss roll and the tasty roll was okay but a bit too heavy for me and I only ate a few pieces. I don't fault the restaurant for that, I am just not the biggest fan of fried rolls. My boyfriend loved his meal and all of the sauces that came with it. He said he would definitely get it again. 

I took one star off because it's just sooooooo small and congested. That said, we really liked it and will be back."}
{"text":"We love this place. The food is great. But the service has gotten slower and slower. Granted, it's Sunday night of a holiday weekend at 8pm, but we've been waiting over almost an hour for our food. Seems that to-go orders are getting priority while we still just sit here. Watching to-go people come and go while we wait is VERY disappointing. Maybe they should treat their sit-down customers with a little more priority. I'm feeling we can't keep coming back here. So disappointing.

Edited to add: when the food FINALLY came, we told the waitress it had been over an hour and that we saw many to-go orders come and go, she said that it was because so many people ordered sushi?? What?? People ordered sushi at a sushi place?!? They didn't seem to care we were upset. :-("}
{"text":"I kind of feel bad for writing this review but I'm highly upset! After sitting at the sushi bar for a good 10 minutes after being sat. Nobody came to take my order after they gotten me my water. I've been coming here since 2007, service here has gotten worse every single time I come here. I'm a server myself at a local sushi restaurant in Charlotte. Maybe because I am a college student and they think I can't tip so they wouldn't pay me any mind...? Who knows. With 3 servers and under 10 tables during lunch, nobody can provide me any service?! My money is just as good as the next person.
The older Asian lady, I assume she is the manager gives the worse service especially when my friend and I came here for lunch. My friend who is also in the food industry agrees.
If you get great service from her than your probably a regular here or not of a minority group.
2 stars because I love the food and its close to my house but sadly, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Great sushi at great prices. It's a little hard to find in the strip mall but it's well worth it. It's small so go on off times or early. 

We ordered a lobster roll and tuna roll. Both were fantastic. Fresh. Crunchy. Flavorful. 

My new favorite sushi place."}
{"text":"It was fine, but didn't really live up to all the hype imo. I had a miso soup, which was good though I really wish they had more soup options. Then we shared 3 rolls: the Master Roll, the Sweet Dragon Roll, and the Lobster King roll. All were good, but nothing really blew us away. We agreed the Sweet Dragon was our least favorite, but we were split on our favorite of the three. Service was friendly, and took an average amount of time for everything. I would chalk this up as a good place when you don't want to travel far for sushi, but I've had better sushi in Charlotte."}
{"text":"This place has good food at reasonable prices, it's more of a Chinese menu, but very good."}
{"text":"Slowest service ever!! Arrived at 6:45pm waited 40 mins for a table for one. Ordered my food around 7:30 my order came out after 8pm AND IT WAS WRONG!!

I wanted Salmon sashimi. Thats it. No rice, no salad.  Just salmon. What I got was a sashimi combo plater of several other fish that I didn't want. After waiting over an hour for my food I just picked a few pieces, paid and left. My waitress clearly didn't understand what I wanted. 

I also ordered the poke which was good. However it was served in a martini glass so all the soy and delicious juice was pooled at the bottom of the glass and the top portion was bland. The glass is a cute serving idea but not good for the person wanting to enjoy flavor with their food.

I watched the staff fumble around and deliver the wrong food to many tables.  It was so small and cramped. The atmosphere was poor.  This place needs to be on that show \"Kitchen Nightmares\"."}
{"text":"Yummy! We have been here several times...sometimes busy but ALWAYS very tasty. We like the sweet dragon roll and the chicken and shrimp bento box. If you don't know what to get, then get that. Serves two. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Overall excellent sushi. As a NY'er and a foodie and a sushi snob I fully endorse this place.
Decent to good service.  Fresh fish.  Creative rolls. This has become my go to place."}
{"text":"Love this place! I got here for lunch from time to time because I love sushi and you can get some really good sushi for a very low price. Their other offerings, such as the Chicken and Crab Bento Box with a bunch of fixings, are excellent as well. Not one complaint or bad thing to say about their food.

The place is small but there always somewhere to sit. I love how the have the sushi chefs at the back wall of the restaurant so you can see all the stuff being made.

Great selection of different dishes if you're not into sushi and decent selection of standard Asian beers, wines and sake.

My only complaint is the wait time which is why they did not get the 5th start from me. It seems that every time I've gone it takes longer than usual to have our food delivered to the table. Not unreasonable but noticeably.

Aside from that you're gonna love this quaint little  place."}
{"text":"Fresh and yummy sushi. Great prices. Friendly service. I get a lot of take out though because it's always busy and the seating area is small."}
{"text":"This was a great experience for lunch, it was rather busy and the atmosphere was pretty hip. This is a small operation, a couple of waitresses and two people preparing the meals on the counter prep area and a lady who seems like the main person. Place came highly recommend and did not disappoint, platters seem like a work of art, are tasty and flavorful as well as the most exquisite presentation. Great place for informal and casual dining. Top nothc!"}
{"text":"NZC is absolutely hands down the freshest most delicious sushi this area has to offer!! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"As a front desk agent in a hotel, I just love great customer service. I am well aware that dealing in customer service is very hard.  However, the guest deserves a nice experience.  I had heard so much about this place and decided to give it a try.  The food was ok. I did like the mango chicken plate but the service was awful.  It was a Wednesday and the server obviously did not want to be there. She was so rude without even saying hello to us. Her first words were only two of you referring to my friend and I.  In a small nice environment, she made it even smaller and obviously did not want us there.  My experience was not great at all because of the service."}
{"text":"I love this place .. it's a tiny cafe tucked in the back of the strip mall. Don't be fooled by its looks .. it's usually crowded during lunch and dinner hours .. their sushi is delicious and prices are affordable.."}
{"text":"My frist time last night and it was excellent. The place is small and there was a wait, about 15 minutes which wasnt bad. We were a two top and were sat next to another two top where the guy talked non-stop about BS the entire time we were trying to enjoy dinner... the BF is the one who eats sushi, I do not (in fact I eat no seafood except the canned tuna)... he orderede the H.O.T. roll, he was in heaven... he convinced me to try and it was amazing. It was lightly battered and fried and had tuna, I think jalapenos too, I liked that it was slightly warm? I ordered the mango chicken with garlic noodles... the dish came with fried shrimp (BF ate and I asked if he liked and got an mmmhmmm) crab and creamcheese fried thingies (I ate one not a lot of filling but it tasted good, BF said it was decent)... the salad was bleh, cruddy bagged iceburg lettuce with some dressing, I passed. Garlic noodles super good and the mango chicken had really good flavor and a lot of peppers, onions and mangos in it, I perfected it with some hot sauce and ate away. BF had some other wasabi roll and he said that was really good as well. I would definately go back and try something different, I was eyeing the steak and pork chops but figured Id check out the chicken first. I think it would be a good place to order take out and I am looking forward to bringing my brother when he visits."}
{"text":"New Zealand Cafe is such a tiny place. The sushi is among the best I've had though. Great prices and a huge variety of rolls. Friendly service too!"}
{"text":"First visit today. Excellent sushi. All four rolls I tried were delicious. At 5:45 (!!) there was a wait so get there early. It's too far for my to get takeout from this place which makes me sad but I hope to eat there again."}
{"text":"THE BEST SUSHI I HABE EVER HAD! Always fresh and delicious. My only issue is that this place is super small. If you are sitting at the short tables you don't have any privacy because you might as well be sitting with the people next to you."}
{"text":"New Zealand Cafe is hands down my favorite sushi spot in Charlotte. They have the best prices around without sacrificing quality. Everything is fresh and service is always good but expect long lines during peak hours. My only gripe is the number of different menus you receive when seated (c'mon people, CONSOLIDATE!) - you'll see what I mean when you go."}
{"text":"The unagi don is about average, and sushi is okay too. Nothing suprising but nothing tastes bad. Good to have the option to take out."}
{"text":"Casual, crowded, yummy fresh food!
I want to cancel out of ghis rebiew  but the app wo t let me aaaahhjj"}
{"text":"The best sushi in Charlotte hands down. This place is amazing and I come here twice a week. When friends want sushi I bring them here. The wait is long but well worth it."}
{"text":"A bit on the small side for dining space, but don't let the small size fool you.  The delicious food, friendly service, and wide variety way compensates for size. Good things do come in small packages."}
{"text":"One of my favorite place good prices, good food, nice people and cozy."}
{"text":"Believe the hype .. everything is delicious.. I get the dragon roll .. and remember you get a free meal on ur birthday"}
{"text":"Awesome prices, attentive service, and great food. The mango chicken was excellent, and their sushi selection was wide and innovative. In spite of being in a strip mall, the restaurant is pleasant and inviting for dining in. The place is quite small, however, so if you come during peak dinner hours, be prepared to wait. It's worth it!"}
{"text":"By far, a sushi gem in Charlotte. We ordered the sushi boat and it was amazing! One of the best sushi spots, fresh, creative decor, and delicious. With that said, why not a five star review, unfortunately the service is somewhat slow and the location is small, so on a crowded night, there is a wait...with no bar or seating area. With that said, we will be back."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints - probably the best sushi place that I have found in Charlotte. 
And yes...gulp...it's in a strip mall. But the atmosphere is cozy and the wait staff is very friendly. The sushi is great and fresh - and there are a variety of options for those that aren't into sushi. They also serve beer and wine."}
{"text":"Affordable?  Yes.  Fresh?  Mostly.  Cramped?  Yup.  Slow?  Absolutely. Worth it?  Depends on how much you like sushi.

Those that rave about this place really don't know quality sushi.  Harsh perhaps, but true.  I went all nigiri here; I appreciate that all fish has its Japanese name, even though the server couldn't understand my white-guy pronunciation.  Anyways, some things I tried were fresh, some were clearly thawed from frozen.  Some items that I ordered were subbed out, (e.g. I ordered ama ebi, got ebi...that'd be like ordering raw tuna, and receiving fried catfish).  and some simply were not served (where's the hamachi)?  

It was by no means terrible, and for the price I would go again, but don't expect to get blown away here.  NZ cafe is affordable sushi in a strip mall, no more, no less."}
{"text":"Waited over an hour for soggy salty sushi. Super tight seating, unorganized waitlist situation. Never goin back"}
{"text":"We were on a mission to find an amazing sushi boat and New Zealand Caf√© delivered! Service was exceptional and prices reasonable for the quality of sushi. I love finding hidden spots in ho-hum strip malls."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Charlotte. Prices are fair. The only reason I gave it four stars is because of the cramped quarters and the wait, but trust me, it's worth it. Oh, and I really wish they'd condense their menu into one. They give you four different menus (but now I'm nitpicking)."}
{"text":"It has been a year or so since I visited this cafe.  I don't have lasting memories of that visit recalling only that the food was okay.  It is nowhere on my daily travels and I had not returned until today.  Yes, the place is quaint, but only three tables were occupied on this evening during a drenching thunderstorm.  In any case, I stopped in today for sushi and ordered:

1. Vegetable tempura (deep fried sweet potato (MY FAV!), zucchini, broccoli and potato)
2.  Favorite Roll (crispy jumbo shrimp, spicy snow crab, avocado soybean paper with a spicy flavored mayo sauce)
3. Chicken tempura

The sushi was fantastic!  I am a sweet potato lover, so the vegetable tempura with a bit of crunch was delicious (am I partial?...yes!).  The chicken tempura was good, and my favorite seafood roll was pretty darn good as well!  I will be back very soon to give it  another try.

Oh, and I also had Miso soup.  I have read of its 'healing' properties so I wanted to give it a try.  Oddly enough, my visit was Monday and I was pretty sick and stuffy on Tuesday :(  Maybe just a coincidence...  

If you haven't visited the restaurant in a long while, give them another try. Perhaps the sushi chef has changed.  If not, my taste buds have changed for the better!"}
{"text":"I love New Zealand Cafe. It is by far one of my favorite sushi places to go to and it is 'oh-so-close' to where I live, lucky me! The restaurant itself is small with just a few tables and decor that might not really make sense. But I'm not here to look at the walls, I'm here to mow down on some sushi...correct?! Correct!

Please try the Poke, it's delicious, and I love the lemon they turn into a snail with their garnish artistry. Eat this, and you won't be disappointed.

Normally I get 2 rolls, usually with eel or shrimp, those are my favorite types of rolls. Sweet Dragon is good, and if you like spicy for for Spicy Dragon. Take some time to try the single Nigri pieces too!

Can't have rice?????
That's okay, there are 5-6 rice-less rolls on the menu.
Try
Bamboo Roll ..............................................$ 10.95
Red snapper, tuna, salmon, flying fish roe, scallion 
wrapped with thin sliced cucumber & ponzi sauce

While sometimes there can be a line out the door due to is uber goodness and small seating area I will always come back to NZ Cafe!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place.  Tiny restaurant with a big heart and great food.  Great service from Kathy every time, all of the other ladies are great too.  Food is always fresh and so delicious.  Prices are very reasonable.  Do yourself a favor and check out these awesome people.  The place has about 10 tables so best to go for a late lunch or early dinner.  Rolls to try: Spider-Man, lemon salmon, bombing, sweet roll, crispy seafood, cilantro roll, volcano, wasabi salmon..... Just go, do it now."}
{"text":"There's almost always a wait here, and that's because it's sooooo good and so cheap! The main courses come with a TON of food and they are all around $8. Plus, the sushi is awesome. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was lacking- the wait was over 30 minutes and the air-conditioning was not working properly. The area was very crowded and left little room to move around or feel comfortable enough to relax. Sushi was pretty decent, probably would be good for a to-go stop."}
{"text":"Good food and decent prices! Best one around matthews. The only down side of the restaurant is being too small. Should always ask for the high tables if you want some privacy because the middle tables are way too close to one another that it feels like you are dining with strangers (and yes..they could hear all of your conversations)"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi spot in Charlotte. It's off the beaten track, about 15 minutes outside the uptown area. 

I cannot speak high enough of the quality of sushi from New Zealand Cafe. The food is always fresh and flavorful, the portions are big and the price is incredibly low for the quality of food you'll receive. 

Everything from the basics--tuna avocado roll, California roll etc. to the more complex played--sweet dragon roll, bigger roll etc. are fantastic. I couldn't even list my favorites because it would be the entire menu. 

Go!"}
{"text":"Pretty small place and it stays packed. Sometimes the wait is extremely long. Understandably because the food is amazing! I love the crazy roll, fried oyster roll, and the shrimp tempura roll."}
{"text":"After reading all the rave reviews about NZ Cafe, knowing I'm still on the search for my go-to sushi place in and around Charlotte, I had to give them a try. 

Per the suggestions of others my bf and I went for a late lunch during the week to try to avoid a crowd. We got there around 1:45pm and there were a couple tables open - no one is kidding when they say this place is tiny. But, that wasn't necessarily a shot against it - our waiter could see us from essentially anywhere in the restaurant so when we were ready to order it was super easy to flag him down. Speaking of which, the service in general was pretty good. My water was always filled and they checked up on us a couple times to make sure the food was satisfactory.

We ended up going with a few rolls and several pieces of nigiri. The fish itself tasted very fresh, I would almost just get nigiri next time, and I enjoyed the rolls but I have definitely had better. The prices are pretty much unbeatable and the list of options is fairly extensive. It seemed like many of the rolls had a lot of the same ingredients though so if you're looking for variety (and sans cream cheese) you might be looking for a little while. 

All in all, if I was in the area already I would definitely stop in for a late lunch again. But it's a little too out of the way (35min drive) and didn't knock my socks off enough for me to justify going regularly."}
{"text":"Go here for the sushi, it's awesome! The spicy salmon skin rolls are the bomb. Prices are great, service is great."}
{"text":"Don't let the exterior fool you. Sushi is absolutely delicious and some of the best prices around. Definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"If there was a 4.5 star option, I'd pick that one. 

Cons first: smaller space, longer wait. That's it.

Pros: WASABI TUNA ROLL. AND spicy tuna roll. And tiger roll. and... (you get it).

This place has some awesome sushi. I should know by now to not judge a book by its cover, but I was NOT excited when we pulled up to join some friends for dinner. 

There were four of us and we ended up completely destroying 7 rolls of sushi. I would have gladly had just one, but our friends couldn't make a decision between some of their favorites, and then we happened to score a free roll because of a birthday in the group (a banana concoction of some sort that I keep thinking about, days later- super creative and delicious). No rolls left. Every morsel of rice gone. 

I also appreciated the presentation aspect of this place. The sushi looked incredible- like something you'd find at a much more expensive and upscale restaurant. They also use these large bamboo boats to serve the larger orders on. Apparently that's a \"thing\", but I've never seen or heard of it. Nice touch. 

New favorite sushi in Charlotte. No contest."}
{"text":"Sushi and service is great. Jackie, sushi chef is sweet and is great at making sushi.  This is the best sushi restaurant in mecklenburg county. I've tried many other restaurants and they are good but they aren't consistent. Consistancy in restaurants are very important and this place got it down. 
Thanks New Zealand for great food, quick service, and customer service."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi restaurant of all charlotte. Great sashimi and my favorite roll is the spicy dragon roll one of the best rolls on the menu"}
