{"text":"This review will be a little more personal. So in high school (like 10 years ago) we would have special days where the school cafeteria would serve these little chicken buffalo sauced wings and drumsticks like 2-3 times a month. They were very small like about 3 inches long with a good amount of meat. I've always looked forward to these days, and i'm sure majority of the kids at this school loved it too, bcuz the lines would be krazy long with a capital K. Well the wings here reminded be of that cafeteria wings I had back in highschool lol. It was like a childhood flash back. I ordered 10 the first time. The following day, i ordered 20 and my bud ordered another 10 on top. Now i'm comparing these wings to the wings in a cafeteria in highschool, in LA. I really enjoyed those wings and I really enjoyed these. These were much more bigger in portion and it didnt come with the cateferia sides. Which was like white rice (for some reason), fruit, and milk. Try it tell, lmk if you think my high school cafeteria wings were bomb, or was my palate at a young age not developed. Or still hasnt developed LOL.

Oh I had their pizza also, it was aiite."}
{"text":"Come to this place and try the breadsticks with the cheese dip. It is amazing. The pizza is ok but nothing like the actual Noble Romans pizza restaurants that they have in Indiana. At least it says it is a Noble Roman express so that is what you get, an Express pizza which is not that bad for an Express pizza. Prices are a little on the high side but what do you expect it is located in a Casino. Another feature of this place is that it has a Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream there too. I did not try the ice cream but Dreyer's is a brand name and the ice cream looked very good and was reasonably priced. I did notice that the pistachio ice cream was not Dreyer's it was Thrifty Ice cream but Thrifty is still a brand name ice cream that is very popular. Anyways if you are in the area you should definitely check this place out for a bite to eat."}
{"text":"This is an all in one spot featuring Noble Romans, Subway, A coffee spot and Dreyers ice cream. While I was there, I saw guests ordering from all 4 brands so it was buzzing. I came for ice cream. Flavor selection is limited since they have to share the shortage of counter space but I was happily treated to a triple dip of toasted pistachio, rocky road and butter pecan. Yum! Service was quick, efficient and helpful. Dining area was a little dirty but it was busy"}
{"text":"Pizza is good for the price. Made fresh in 5 minutes!  Not a high end pizza but does suck up some beer. There is also a subway at the same counter in case you have someone wanting something a little more healthy."}
