{"text":"I had a really good lunch here today.  The steak special was a sirloin served with crab risotto that had real chunks of crab.  The sweet potato fries were nice and crispy, some of the best I've ever had.  The blueberry bread pudding for dessert was lovely, and my lunch date, who has recently lost some weight but has a Friday cheat day, ordered it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream that turned out to be three fantastic, house-made scoops of deliciousness.  Service was good as well (if a bit of a  downtown cliche: beautiful 22 year olds in Lulu Lemon tank tops).  It's a nice, high-ceilinged space with good downtown people-watching."}
{"text":"Good food, great patio, great service and fun atmosphere.   A friend and I decided to stop by this restaurant for a early lunch in the sun. The staff were fast and energetic and the manager and I hit it off over my Michigan shirt. What a cool spot. I will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Their patio is incredible! Its worth going just for that. Decent selection for wine and drinks too - their mixed drinks are lacking some punch. It's very much the suit crowd but that's to be expected.   Fish tacos are amazing! The sliders were good too but their wings are not worth ordering. The service was good, a bit slow but not a big deal."}
{"text":"What can you say when bad service and forgetful cuisine ruins an otherwise fun, energetic, yet cool patio scene? Good drinks! ...when you get them. Don't waste a dinner date here, unless you're eating around several cocktails and prepared to lounge - a while - between dishes.   SoT does offer you a vibrant, upscale, beach-style patio oasis - like Queen West's Ultra but without the 24/7 house reverberating through your skull. Though floods of larger parties keep the noise level very high here, even for the open outdoor setting.  This is a great place for cool drinks as the summer heat breaks. Enjoy the scene, some decent apps, then move on for dinner elsewhere if that's your priority for the night."}
{"text":"By attending South of Temperance you can finally answer the age old question of \"Where can I get a pint of domestic for $9 pre-tip\"? No joke, two Creemore and two Big Wheel for $34, totally reasonable. In fact Big Wheel is more than a domestic, it's a municipal. I suppose it's that long trip from Amsterdam (the brewery at Lakeshore and Bathurst, not where Anne Frank lived) all the way to Bay and Adelaide (2.9 km according to Google Maps) that makes it so expensive.   Oh, by the way, the food sucks.   The only thing keeping South of Temperance from one star is that the crowd is a little more eclectic than your usual Bay Street hangout."}
{"text":"Great joint for after work drinks. I'm not sure it stands on its own as a great restaurant, but it certainly stands out from the mass of irish pubs in the area. Foodwise, I had the fish tacos and was quite impressed - extra points for the plating, since the tacos come on a little stand!   Unfortunately, I didn't get to check this place out until after the summer patio season was over, but I will definitely be back next summer!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night for dinner and drinks with friends, and was surprised to find the place packed even though summer patio season was long over, which was when the hype first began about this place.  Inside, it had a 'warehouse' type feel with the cement ceiling, exposed pipes and side garage style door which apparently opens up to the patio.  Atmosphere was lively with upbeat music, and staff were friendly, occasionally checking on us and topping up our wine glasses.   Being a fan of chicken panini's, I ordered the Chicken Cobb Panini, which has guava aioli, apple smoked bacon, and mozzarella cheese inside it as stated on the menu. After a couple of bites, I thought I was eating the wrong sandwich when I realized that there was also a chopped egg inside the sandwich! It made for an \"interesting\" mix with the chicken (not the good kind of interesting) and would probably not order it again.  Sweet potato fries were yummy, especially with the garlic aioli sauce which is slightly spicier compared to the horseradish aioli sauce.   The crowd starts to thin out closer to 9 pm, so if you don't want to strain your voice or ears trying to have a conversation with the person next to you, then that's the time to go :)"}
{"text":"Horrible service.   Making a reservation was difficult. (Not because they don't have a table because they needed to ask the manager.)  It took 2 hours to have lunch during weekdays. Enough said. It wasn't even busy. There were other servers but they were all just hanging out. The waiter was too slow to get our order, bring drinks, and food. Many of us had burgers and some of the patties weren't cooked enough. When we told the waiter, the manager came and said they ran out of the patties they prepared the day before and the new ones they put together look like as if they aren't cooked enough but they are. (so if your patty is done properly, it's a day old patty wt...) When they brought back again, the patties were done properly. How about just saying \"sorry we messed up\"? This is BBQ country. Who doesn't have an experience bbqing a burger? We couldn't buy the excuse the manager gave us. Totally unsatisfied with the service and food but because we were party of over 8 people the gratuity of 18% was added to the bill automatically.   It's in financial district. If it wants the customers to come back, they'd need heck of a lot more than waitresses in mini skirts and tank tops."}
{"text":"I thought this place was ok. I was there for drinks on a Thursday night. The place was pretty packed but despite that, the service was good. The crowd on a weeknight/Thursday after work was just right for me: about 30s. The noise level was that of a large bar/restaurant filled with patrons really enjoying themselves. So I had to speak loudly to the person across the table from me but it wasn't impossible to have a conversation.  I really enjoyed their selection of drinks, especially the pitchers they had available. We had a pitcher of mojitos and a pitcher of spiked lemonade. Each pitcher was about the size of maybe 2-3 *small* drinks each and ordering like this certainly made it easier on us since the bar was so full.  We also enjoyed their menu. They had enough small plates and appetizers that it made it easy to order a few things and share among the group.  I thought the prices were pretty average. Maybe a tiny bit on the high side."}
{"text":"The patio is nice enough, set between the towering buildings of the financial district. The service was decent.   We came on a Saturday evening, not the wildly popular Wed-Friday evenings that are full suits and dress code. This was obvious as everyone in attendance was basically in flip flops.   Sat night drink specials included a Caesar, lemonade, sangria all for $5 with 17% autograt (read the fine print). After having a lemonade myself and tasting some friends cocktails, I am not convinced there was much booze in them. I switched to wine which cost $17 for a 9oz glass (what is WITH Toronto lately) so I was in for $50 on booze alone after our night out.  The food was ok. Nothing spectacular. Not sure at all why everyone raves about these fish tacos. They are fine, sure, but not at all rave-worthy.   No stockbrokers here, all early twenty-something girls clogging the Washrooms in clumps, teetering on cheap heels and milling about. When the dj broke out the dubstep mix, I knew it was time to go.   It was ok. Will not be rushing back to visit by any means. The highlight of the evening were the cupcakes that I brought in from Bobette &  Belle. Delicious."}
{"text":"Another day at work in the city, and a couple of friends and I wanted to meet up for lunch. Someone else chose the place, and I'm glad they did because I really enjoyed it. We went around 12-ish, prime-time on a weekday so it was packed. Be warned, if you're not here in a suit, you might feel out of place. At least my friends and I were all dressed up from work.   We got a table fairly fast, and the servers were very nice. Great service overall, although the wait time for our food was a bit longer than usual (reasonably understandable, considering how packed it was). Very nice d√©cor and ambiance - classy yet modern. And yes, all the servers are in black mini-dresses.   I went with the slow-braised beef short rib sandwich ($14-ish?), with a side of sweet potato fries. It was extremely good; just moist enough without getting sauce everywhere. The fries were well cooked as well; not too greasy and just the right amount of crispiness. My friend had the aio tuna salad, which eh said was good; the tuna was nicely seared and there were pieces of watermelon in it, fairly surprising.   So overall, it was a great place for lunch; the service was pretty good, the waitresses were friendly ever though you could tell they were busy, the food was great and worth the prices, and the ambiance was vibrant enough (for a bunch of business people having conversations). Definitely will come back to try their other dishes!"}
{"text":"Went in here to grab lunch with my mother the other day... Waiter was incredibly surly and slow (salad took 1 hour to arrive no apologies or updates from staff). When it did, my $20.00 salad had MAYBE 1 oz of chicken on it and a sliver of avocado.The credit card machine to pay my bill was pre-set at at a 17% tip post tax total which i didnt feel was deserving at all of the service or quality. I told the serve the salad was disappointing so he sent over the manager who snapped at me that he sells 200 of those salads a day and  no one hasn't liked it so it must be my problem! I would stay far far away!"}
{"text":"I like this place for a few reasons.  One, their patio is big.  Two, there's a lot to look at - if you like mingling this is the place to be.  Three, I live around the corner.  The service is decent and I've tried a few of their menu items.  The steak is great, a possible 7/10.  Fish tacos and seviche are fresh.  All yummy.  Prices are a tad more than normal, but fair.  This place is only good for the after-work crowd.  Overall 4 stars."}
{"text":"Had the Fish Tacos, Bereta Sliders and the lamb with Quinoa. Fantastic on all counts, the service was very good and it's got a fantastic patio. Looks to have a pretty regular Bay Street crowd.   The fish taco garnishings were obviously fresh and very tasty. Fare seems local and unique. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Can't speak for the food, as I was just there last night for drinks with a bunch of girlfriends from work. As others have mentioned, lots of suits which means I can't actually speak to the price of the drinks - that was nice.  Howeverr.... WHO DOESN'T HAVE SODA. A very friendly suit offered to buy me a drink and I requested a vodka-soda. What I got was a vodka-water. I asked him, and he told me the outdoor bar was out of soda. OUT OF SODA. I don't get this.   Otherwise, a solid patio and a crowd that is to be expected in the financial district. Food does look interesting, maybe I'll try brunch sometime.    Bouncers/door staff very friendly, no line at around 10:45pm and we weren't especially dressed up (I was in nice jeans, a nice top and flat boots) and we had no issues."}
{"text":"The suits have left the Keg and have migrated South...of Temperance!  If you are into the Bay Street crowd, then this is the place for you! It's PACKED. There's always a lineup.   If you're lucky, you can stand by the bar.  You can reserve a table though, just call ahead.  I didn't eat here, but the food looked alright, wings and calamari was popular for those standing at the bar.  After a bottle of wine and a few beers, this place is a really fun time!  I liked the: * Patio (it's winter now, but I can't wait for patio season) * Coat hooks under the bar * Bouncers were friendly-enough and there are heat lamps outside * Older work crowd, acceptable level of douchebagness  Douchebag Meter:   [|||||||||||||||||||||||||||                ]  Perfect for after work drinks and the venue is stumbling distance from Smokes, Burrito Boys, and Yuzu on Adelaide."}
{"text":"Went to South of Temperance for some after work drinks that turned into staying for dinner.  SoT has a bit of that sleazy banker/lawyer/general suit wearing vibe, but it is in the middle of the financial district, so it's excusable, and not the worst I've seen. At least it's friendly sleaze. =)  It's also good for drinks because they manage to pack a lot of people into the place, so you can always get in, but that also means it can get pretty uncomfortable with everyone standing shoulder-to-shoulder around the bar area.  At the risk of sounding old, it was also incredibly loud inside, with the music cranked to a level where everyone had to yell to be heard. And as the night went on and people left, they just turned up the music even louder. I swear I've been to quieter clubs.  The drinks were on par or even maybe even a tiny bit more expensive than other places in the area, at $7.50 a pint.  But the food was decent with okay prices, especially compared to drink prices.  I had a Temperance Burger for about $15 (2 drinks = 1 burger!) and I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"SOT is one of the best Happy Hour joints in the downtown core! I discovered this place last summer after the financial busy season (Jan-April) when I actually got to see daylight when getting off of work. I've been there on numerous occasions but mostly for a happy hour drink with some friends/co-workers as it's conveniently located in the financial district. If you're a suit like me, you'll fit right into the crowd here. Although there are some casual customers from time-to-time, the place is often swarmed by suits.  The best thing about this place; the outdoor patio. I know everyone raves about it but it's for good reason as there are few places that compare. The patio is fully equipped with a bar, tables and even a lounge area with stretch couches for larger groups.Nothing says TGIF in the summer like having a cool pint of beer while sitting out on the patio. And if it gets too sunny, you can always head \"inside\" where there is another bar and plenty of screens to check out how the game's going. The reason why I say \"inside\" is because the place is very open concept. There aren't many walls or doors to separate the inside and the outside patio so even if you escape inside when it's too sunny, you can still enjoy the presence of natural light and the breeze of fresh summer air. And for those of you who enjoy bar scenery, the waiting staff at SOT are pretty easy on the eyes.   Not only is the location/atmosphere great, the food at SOT is pretty damn tasty as well! I've only been there for lunch and for appetizers with some drinks but no one really goes during happy hour as a main source of food intake anyway. I've had the burger there and its about as good as you would expect at your standard bar and grill (3.5 stars). The fish tacos which come in a serving of 3 tacos, are a must have (4.5 stars)! The flaky fish tenders coupled with an exotic mix of slaw and grilled pineapple offers a fresh and exciting explosion of flavor that I rarely expect in places like this. Although they are a little pricey at $12, it is well worth it and is hearty enough to serve as a full meal. You can also add an additional taco for $4 if you're feeling hungry. The prime rib sliders and calamari are also a decent addition to the menu (3.5 stars). Definitely go with a few friends and enjoy a healthy mix of these appetizers with some drinks!  One of the downfalls is the wait time. Since the place is so popular, it's often very difficult to just get a walk in during lunch or right after work. So if you don't want to risk having to wait, call ahead for a reservation!"}
{"text":"Well the atmosphere is always great.  they have one of the largest patios in Toronto.  On a hot humid day like today you can enjoy it or still sit inside with AC.  Drinks selection is great with a full bar.  and the food is quite good!  Enjoy."}
{"text":"I think there should be two types of reviews for South of Temperance - one if you have had a chance to sit out on the patio, and one where you sit indoors. From reading previous reviews, it seems that mediocre food, horrible service and average everything else can be forgiven so long as you were in the patio area. However, with Fall fast approaching (if not here already), a group of friends that my boyfriend and I were meeting chose to sit indoors. And thus, the review of a pretty average, over-hyped restaurant begins.  Intro. Friday nights in any financial district restaurant would be busy, and South of Temperance is no exception. You basically walk into a LARGE, square room with akwardly placed tables all around and a bar area in the middle. Loud. Noisy. Bland. We inadvertenly walked in the entrance by the patio and was immediately told something to the effect of that way. We really couldn't hear so we walked in the direction of the lady's long finger and we found our friends. Amazing! She looked at us and knew who our friends were? Space was extremelyyyy tight - to give you a picture, my friend could not even pull out his chair to sit as the man from the other table basically occupied that space. Unfortunately, he was scum and would not move (and later on in the night, our server told us that he was a regular and was the type of guy who would place his order, than immediately after, follow her to the kitchen and ask if his drink was ready...barf bag please)  Food. The menu items are nothing outstanding - you can get burgers, pasta, french fries, salad etc...Bascially, dishes that you can have anywhere else. And then of course there are the drinks, which this restaurant has an extensive menu for: red and white wine varieties along with beers and hard liqour. I had a 9oz Cab Sauv for 10 bucks along with a cheesy and actually delicious poutine dish that I shared with my boyfriend.   Service was very slow, but I am not going to hold it against our server. It was basically her and another girl serving 50 people on our side of the restaurant. But, our server was still all smiles despite having to run around like mad. Management should have known that Friday nights would be busy so FYI - if you don't mind having no service for long periods of time, then this restaurant is for you. I would suggest you to order all your dishes and drinks at once when your server comes, because after that, you are pretty much on your own.  South of Temperance has attempted to surround itself in a rich veneer, but at the heart of it, this place is really nothing special. It basically is a dressed up watering hole for the men and women in suits of downtown's fianance and miscellaenous crew. But, that's what they like and I get it...sometimes you want to go somewhere that's not a pub. Sometimes, you just want to flaunt your wealth or the appearance of wealth and this place allows you to do that.   In my opinion, I would not come out of my way to eat here or even have drinks. But then again, I didn't get a chance to try the patio and perhaps if I had met my friends in the summer, my review would be much different. We were a group of 8, but I paid for 3 of my friends so I will leave it to you to judge the dollar value, but 1 red wine, 1 poutine, and 4 Scotch came out to $70 excluding tips."}
{"text":"This review applies to the drinks only and on a weekend visit (this place is really slow on weekends apparently). Wanting to grab something late (11:30ish) my friends GF suggested we come here as she is a regular here. I had passed by this place several times and always admired the nice patio.  We walked in and the place was almost empty and we are talking a Saturday night here. Needless to say they have drink specials to entice people to drop by during weekends as local beers and rail drinks are 5$. Sadly the kitchen was closed so we just ended up grabbing a drink here. Even though the place was almost empty it took some time to get the servers attention. I just had rum and coke and my friends had a baileys and coffee drink. My drink was watered down to the point that I was wondering there was any rum in it. My friends did enjoy their drink though.   For a place to grab and drink and some grub one can do a lot better in this area."}
{"text":"They're right -- the patio is great. Too bad you can't really enjoy it on a Friday night as the place is overwhelmingly packed and they don't take reservations. The food was surprisingly good, but the service was what you'd expect when you have people at tables and also standing between tables."}
{"text":"I think I can keep this short because I reflect the sentiments of most of the reviews here.  Charlotte W. gives the perfect details to Laily S.'s summary of this place:  \"I don't come here for food/service. Just drinks and a nice patio in the summer.\"  I would just amend the service part, as the server I had was actually great but just was challenged to cover the tables.  She had tables assigned to her across the entire restaurant so she had to run around the restaurant instead of working on an area (we had 8, another table had 20, etc...great for tips I'm sure but you really have to work for those especially if you are crossing the restaurant to attend your clients).  Layout was brutal, though I realize that this place is known mainly for the patio...which happened to be closed.  I guess in Canada you really want your best feature to be your outdoor patio where you of course have the ability to keep it open for 8 months of the ye....wait a minute, this is canada, its backwards here....  So hopefully the higher prices helps this place make enough money during our limited patio season to hire someone to rearrange the interior.  I don't want to end off with people feeling that I was overly harsh on this place because really my critique has been on management (i,e,  focus on a patio appeal as their main attribute, layout of the interior, etc).    The poutine I tried was greeeaaat! I never thought to mix ribs with poutine but now I can't think of how I ate it any other way.  The serving staff was good.  South of Temperance is a cool and mysterious name.  (FYI - the only Temperance I could find is 50 miles south of detroit so really South of Temperance is just the USA (which is their cuisine??...mystery solved I think...)"}
{"text":"If you ever need a spot to dock your aircraft carrier ...  Yeah. The patio is massive and everyone is beautiful, just like Andre M mentioned, so it was a good thing that I brought my most chic fingerstash with me, otherwise I surely would've been stopped at the door.  I actually stopped by twice last night: once around 7, but the patio, massive as it may be, was jammed, and then again around 10 for a few nightcaps.  Tip 1: If you're going to go, go early.  Surprisingly, despite its obvious popularity, ostensibly pretentious feel, and our less-than-fine garb, we were welcomed at the door and treated like kings for the night.  Tip 2: Don't be intimidated. Check it out.  The staff were friendly, efficient AND attractive. It's entirely possible that this was my first trifecta experience in the city.  Though we didn't eat, we did peruse the menu and it looked both reasonably-priced as well as extremely tasty. I'm definitely heading over for lunch or dinner next week.  Tip 3: You don't have to sell your aircraft carrier to afford it.  Colour me thoroughly impressed."}
{"text":"One day a senior partner and I went to lunch here. He had suggested this place because I had wanted somewhere TRES close to the office and vegan friendly to SOME extent (-I'm not so picky anymore, I can make anything vegan.) I'm not a lawyer and people actually give a crap about how long my breaks are. Office politics I tell ya, not fun. That's a main reason why I tend to make friends with people who are not in my practice group -they don't care about my work and thus, no drama and everyone's happy.  To my surprise, South of Temperance is JUST across the street from our building.  It was VERY packed in there when we arrived. The place was full of suits, practically everyone was a suit! I was with a suit! (Well, it was casual Friday so a casual suit!) Given the restaurant's close proximity to Bay Street, its types of patrons should be a no brainer, but if you are clueless like me, you might not have given that a thought prior to agreeing to having lunch here. Good thing I always dress up for work. It pays to adhere to dress code.  So back to the restaurant... we were seated immediately upon arrival as the counsel had made reservations ahead of time. (Thank God for that cos I thought we would be waiting with everyone else at the door!) The waiter took my coat and gave us adequate time with the menu. The service was surprisingly good for a place that was extremely packed, the waiter didn't even fuss when I changed my sweet potato fries to a spring mix. I guess it's true, 'you get what you pay for', though the prices weren't terrible.   I ordered a portebello mushroom burger with a side order of spring mix salad (changed from sweet potato fries). The burger came on a cross bun and had avocadoes and other veggies on the portebello mushroom, which was the \"meat\" patty. It was delicious, but very hard to bite into because it was very big and very messy to eat. Slicing it in half did not help either because the burger kept falling apart. But nevertheless, it was a yummy burger and I LOVE that it had the portebello mushroom as the \"meat\" and not some soy patty topped with a portebello mushroom.  I will most def come back here, but only if I'm with a suit, because this place is not for your regular Joes and Joannas, especially on weekdays at lunch. It may be different on weekends, because Bay Street is dead and no one dresses up for the office on weekends! It's casual by default!"}
{"text":"A decent place to have a few cocktails, but I would look elsewhere if you're looking for good eats, unless you're in the mood for random pub grub."}
{"text":"At first when h friends wanted to go to this restaurant I was skeptical. judging by the name is seemed like another over hyped, over priced, new yuppy hang out in downtown Toronto. However, after much insistence I went to the restaurant and have to say that I was pleasantly surprised.   This eating establishment is located in Toronto, surprisingly enough just South of a street named named Temperance. Which, I have to admit, is clever.  The service was very good. The servers were polite, helpful and good. They had a good list of mixed drinks. My only thing to pick on here is the fact that their beer list sucks. I mean if you want to be a serious establishment and have a bunch of beers on tap, why would you just have mass marketed beers. Is it really that hard to have some local beers? Maybe a Mill Street, or a Duggans?  The main reason why I give the restaurant a high rating is the food. They had CEVICHE!!!! I was totally excited when I saw this! Ceviche is a dish made from fresh raw fish marinated in citrus juices such as lemon or lime and spiced with chilli peppers. The citrus denatures the fish so it practically tastes cooked if done correctly. Here they served it with mangos, and it was done superbly. I really like it. They also had fish tacos, which beyond sounding like a metaphor were done really well. The tacos were BIG, and they were filled nicely, and plated well. Just by the plating of the food here, you can tell they really put some love into the food that they serve. This is a trait which definitely brings me back to restaurants, and makes me like them."}
{"text":"...and I thought I was well dressed.  Looked like Harry Rosen store exploded here.  Good for MBA/Business school students to observe natural environment behaviors.  Apparently we're the only ones that didn't bump into Associates coming out of work.  Date: Thursday August 9, 2012. Yes. It was a weekday workday suitday, suit up.  Otherwise, reminds me of a Moxie's.  Chicken Wings ($13) Manhattan ($8+)  2.5'd"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and I like it, but I also like the Bay Street crowd so if that's not your scene, you'll hate this place. It's all suits like someone mentioned earlier. I'll base this review on the time I needed service, since the first time I just stood around and drank.  I just got sliders and ceviche so I can't really judge the food. The sliders were awesome, ceviche was a little bland but otherwise good.  The service was bogus. The first bartender (blonde) that helped us was rude and condescending. Still boggles my mind when wait staff depending on others' generosity in the form of tips have the nerve to feign arrogance. Anyway, later on we were at a standup table on the patio where 4 or 5 different waiters/waitresses walked by us, made eye contact but ignored. We eventually got a busboy to pay attention to us who brought over a waiter that said \"wellll I'm serving the inside...\". Thanks for the info boss, can you please get us a waitress then?! This guy thought we wanted his personal services. God it was like pulling teeth with these people.   Anyway the waitress that wound up helping us for the rest of the night was great. Super sweet girl and very warm.   I don't come here for food/service. Just drinks and a nice patio in the summer."}
{"text":"First time here yesterday and was a bit disappointed in the service, the waitress or kitchen staff forgot my buddy fish taco order, so he had to sit there and watch 5 of us finish our meals before his came out.  In these situation you guys should at least pretend to feel bad and apologize instead of acting like nothing happen."}
{"text":"Great patio, good service- a watering hole for finance guys and gold diggers - but worth going to if you want a nice dinner or night of drinks. For a guilt free, delicious meal go with the apple cheddar salad with grilled salmon- you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Nice spot, waiters/waitresses are cool.  I don't know if that's particular to the establishment or if canadians are that way in general, but it was cool.  Crowd generally seems to be older but there's a mix in terms of age race, but mostly looked like suits.  A nice spot to hang out at for drinks."}
{"text":"This is a great patio restaurant/bar in the financial district of Toronto.  Beautiful well dressed people here and hot waitresses.  The food is mostly organic food i was told & the drink prices aren't as high as I thought they'd be.  Wish I could have re visited."}
{"text":"Decent food and a solid atmosphere. Can't complain."}
{"text":"A simple analogy to sum up my review:  Banana Republic is to Old Navy as South Of Temperance is to Hooters.  Yes I said it, this place is like a classy hooters with better food. The wait staff and bar staff (except for one dude) were all gorgeous women in black mini dresses.  Huge bar in the middle of the restaurant, surrounded by chairs, that incidently look like cheap plastic ballot boxes.  There is also a patio that gets busy in the summer.  Now onto the food. You have to trust a girl when she says \"go for the fish taco, its kind of our specialty\".     Fish tacos: $12 for 3 tacos.  Three fairly big tacos with crispy fish, onions, jicama, a mild avocado sauce, and a touch of coriander, all with a side of spicy chipotle sauce.  This is the only place I've been to that serves jicama, and it was my first time eating it.  Fish tacos were great, fresh, tasty, and a bit of spice if you want it.  Filling enough for a small meal.  Classic burger:  $12 with side of fries.  Thick burger, fresh bun, mixed greens, tomato, grilled onions, and a horseradish alioli.  I didn't care for the horseradish alioli too much. I would have preferred ketchup and mayo.  Either way still a decent burger.  Friend enjoyed the Temperance burger ($14) as well.  Short Rib Poutine: $10 or $7 upgrade from a combo. A poutine like none other I have ever tasted. Sweet potato fries, pulled beef short rib, curds and au jus.  It's almost like a dry beef and potato stew. The beef was tender, a bit light on the cheese, and tad too much salt for me.  A nice different poutine.  Other:  Soda - 2.95. I hate when a place changes 3 bucks for a soda and doesn't give you free refills.  This is not that kind of place.  I got two refills, as I arrived super thirsty - i wondered through the entire dinner if I had drunk $12 work of pop ... luckily I didn't.  Closing thought:  A little expensive if you take it out of context.  If you look at the whole picture it's not a bad value.  For a restaurant located downtown, in the middle of the banking district this place has decent prices, decent portions, and tasty food. 3.5 rounded up to 4."}
{"text":"Best patio in the financial district (huge). Good looking men in suits. Great summer atmosphere, prices aren't cheap but they aren't outrageous either. Don't show up after work between 5 and 6 because the line up is around the corner, but come 7pm you can walk right in and it's still a packed house."}
{"text":"The website says, \"Toronto's biggest patio\" and it just might actually live up to that reputation. If you're chic, attractive, finely garbed and well-heeled, this is the spot for you my Bay Street friend.   I power lunched yesterday. Granted, it was stifling hot on the patio, but it was not unpleasant. I confess, I did not go inside the restaurant, so I leave that to another reviewer.   We did not app, we went straight to the main course accompanied by some pretty standard draft on tap -- raspberry wheat beer and Rickard's Red. Nothing special there, but I suppose you have to have the obvious in stock.  Our meals came quickly and were delicious. I had the goat cheese ravioli in tomato sauce with mini boccaccinni chees. Perfectly cooked. My colleague had the naan bread with chicken which is a chic (never used chic twice in one review before..cool) way of saying personal pizza. Also, perfectly cooked.  The portions are small so app if your hungry.   The servers were attentive and hotter than Georgia ashphalt. I don't know how they convinced all those gorgeous women to wear those micro mini skirts and sexy tops, but wow. And, lets just say that most of the waitresses (and waiters) rank high in facial validity.  So, if you're in the Financial District and want to be seen, and want to impress, go to South of Temperance.  I look forward to other reviewers -- especially those who have been there in the evenings. I think this might replace Ki for hot hot hot in the city core."}
{"text":"Beautiful patio in the Finance district. The drinks are expensive as per that area, and the food is decent, though again, on the pricey side. But I do love that patio!"}
{"text":"2 1/2 stars.  Average, right down the middle.  Went here for a dinner with friends, originally wanting to sit on the (yes massive) patio but we were told if it started to rain they could not guarantee us a table inside.  We took a round booth by the wall.  The atmosphere was good, the service was great, but the food was just average, at best.  I had high hopes for the ahi tuna sandwich I ordered that came with jalapeno aoli.  Upon further inspection, the aoli was slightly spicy mayonnaise.  The Bay dip we got for the table was nothing much then a fancy cheese dip.  Other entrees, bland and average as well.  Overall every was like I said before, just average.  The only stand out would be the atmosphere of the restaurant and I could see how the patio would be great if the weather was cooperating but I don't think I would order more then drinks."}
{"text":"I had lunch there with a friend yesterday.  It was packed ... good thing we'd made a reservation.  This time I ordered a classic burger and fries ... the burger was good.  This place definitely caters to the suits crowd, especially men. All the servers are in black ... the female ones are in tight tank tops showing lots of cleavage and short short skirts.  Our server was very attentive and he came over a couple times to make sure we were doing okay.  The manager also stopped by to make sure that everything was okay."}
{"text":"Couple suits eating lunch  Smoking cigars on the patio is delicious  The waitresses are always beautiful  Watch for crowds between 12 to 1"}
{"text":"This is an old stand-by for lunch with a friend of mine.  She works in the area and we always love to meet for lunch here.  The crowd is reflective of the people who work in the neighbourhood (read: lawyers and other Bay St. folk) and being a cycling fiend and social worker, I barely fit in.  But y'know, I kinda like sticking out like a sore thumb.  The food... the food is ridiculously awesome.  It's so awesome, I wish I could order it in and have it at home every single night.  My friend always gets the Fish Tacos, which I've tried almost every time... they give you a lot of them so go with an appetite or share them.  I've loved the Cobb sandwich, the Lobster Mac 'n Cheese (seriously!) and the Grilled Cheese sandwich.  It's not your typical grilled cheese either... on crusty bread with a whole bunch of loaded, awesome things."}
{"text":"I have three words for this place: H-O-T.  Actually it's smokin' HOT and the food and service aren't bad either!  Seriously, this is a \"see and be seen\" type of establishment with an amazing patio right in the middle of the financial district for a late lunch cocktail or just meeting colleagues after work for a few.  Tables can be hard to come by (especially on the patio) so make reservations and tip the girls at the front door."}
{"text":"Wow, cool patio! Very unique and located in an area with absolutely nothing else going on.   We went on a Friday night. Now that the weather is getting cooler, it was less packed then mentioned by other reviewers. I'm guessing it's not such a hot spot in wintertime.   The interior is really spacious too. I didn't see many of these beautiful people everyone is talking about! It's definitely not a hangout for pretentious wankholes, it seemed like more of a business people/Bay Street crowd. So don't show up in jeans, but there is no reason to break out the glitter and stilettos either.  The prices were moderate. Wine list was pretty extensive but had a wide range of price options with bottles starting as low as $28.   Was a good place to start out the night and grab a drink, but didn't have enough going on to bother sticking around the whole night."}
{"text":"I've always assumed that South of Temperance, being a Suits bar, would be pretty snobby. but I am 100% wrong. The service and friendliness is ubelieveable. As soon as I stepped through the patio door, the manager shook my hand to welcome me and paid me a compliment on my dress. The server we had was funny, smart, and extremely helpful.   The food didn't wow me, but it was pretty good. The best thing about this place though, is their patio. Having a drink here after work with good friends on a summer day and friendly service is why this place is extremely popular."}
{"text":"I think I'm the only one in the group who despises this place. I feel it's lame. The only good thing about it is the patio and the central location. The salads are bland and watery, the fish tacos are OK.  I usually end up here about once a week just because it's literally right across the street from where I work. Other than that it's not great. My preference would be the Duke on Wellington's patio but it's a little further down the street."}
{"text":"Nice Patio!  Cocktails (Manhattan/Apricot Sour) are $8+ and only 1.5 oz small and weak  Awesome Patio!  Chicken Wings ($13) is expensive and hot sauce is meh  Huge Patio!  Services is slow and our drinks took forever to arrive, my friend almost fell asleep waiting for that  South of Temperance is only really worth 2 star but that patio worth that extra 1 star. If you into waitress in tight black mini skirt or suits and smoking cigars on patio is your thing, maybe this is a place for you! I have no interest in all the above!"}
{"text":"2-1/2 stars  I have been here a few times on very different occasions with mixed reviews. Located in the heart of the financial district the place is like an urban oasis. It's the only stand-alone restaurant in the area with a great expansive patio.  South of Temperance scored a long term lease so there's no need to worry that it will be torn down for a condo or office building anytime soon. The upscale Hooters comments here on yelp is a good analogy, which is not a bad thing.  WEDDING: I helped a friend with his wedding reception which was held here, and it proved to be a great venue, especially on a weekend where the area is more relaxed and is very quiet from the work crowd. Tom, which I think is the manager of the restaurant was very nice and accomodating in helping with the reception -- a pleasure to work with. The restaurant handled the food for the wedding flawlessly and the dinner was well prepared and tasted good -- I typically find wedding food to be rather mediocre, but not here. The little desserts that they offered was rather lack luster and seemed to be either from frozen or made off-site, no biggie as the star should be the wedding cake. The wait staff, looking hot as always, were attentive, friendly and upbeat. They made sure that water and wine were often replenished.  LUNCH: Forgo the patio on a windy day. With nearby construction, the downtown wind tunnel effect made for an unpleasant meal outside as dust, dirt and debris is thrown in all directions and the furniture gets a little dirty. Food was good. The fish tacos are great and I really like the cobb sandwich -- hard boiled egg inside a grilled panini is a tasty combination. Service was a tad slow with the hoardes of Bay Street lunch crowd -- best to go for an early or late lunch.   AFTER WORK: My last visit was less than stellar. The doorman at the entrance of the patio almost refused to let me in because of their dress code. I was dressed very sharp in all black (not out of place with the other people there), but the doorman noticed my shoes. I wore a pair of custom designed black and red leather Jack Percells, which didn't look too casual or like running shoes and I always get compliments everywhere I go. Unfortunately the doorman didn't appreciate my progressive style eventhough I arrived with a group of friends who knew this doorman.  He let me in with a warning.  Inside the restaurant and patio I did noticed a few people wearing canvas Chuck Taylors and one wearing flip flops amongst the sharp-, tired- and pretensious-looking suit crowd, so the dress code seems rather loose here. Ironically one of the waitresses complimented me on my shoes.  The place gets really busy after work and you could imagine the bar being packed with thirsty after work patrons. There is a bit of a wait at the bar, but the wait staff are trying their best to keep up with the crowd and applaud them for keeping a good attitude and being appreciative.  On the way out the doorman told me to wear better shoes next time. I didn't know if the doorman was playing with me or was being a pompous dick, but either way that kind of attitude is not acceptable to any of their customers. I knock off a star because of the ignorant doorman. West end hipsters be warned: best to enter through the main entrance rather than the patio entrance to avoid the doorman nonsense."}
{"text":"I think the reason for this place was to attract the Bay St. crowd who want to a) make use of the giant patio in the summer and b) ogle the waitresses.  This, and because of the location at Bay and Adelaide.    Staff are friendly here but food is merely average.  I ordered the fish tacos, and I liked the jicama slaw but the fish was soggy and so were the wrappers.  Disappointing!    The restaurant also has a distinctly chain feel to it.    In the winter time it's nice coming here with all the big windows and it is surprisingly not drafty despite it being all windows.  I will only come back for summer patio drinks, but beyond that not too exciting."}
{"text":"Checked out SoT one Friday evening. It was busy but wasnt too full (maybe coz it's January, who knows!!)  Venue: strategically located to draw the office crowds. Cant wait to check out their patio in the Summer B-)  Food: we just ordered apps and they were good =D  Drink: They have pretty much anything you can think of. The ladies loved their wine sangria while the gents their scotch!!  Ambiance: trendy and loud. Beautiful people type of crowd =P  Service: Friendly (and pretty) ladies. The only problem was the one bill per large group. I understand their tactic but it could be quite frustrating for people who come/leave early/late. Figuring how to split the bill towards the end of the night, after everyone was pretty boozed up, was, let's just say, a drag!!"}
