{"text":"I have a mixed review of this place. I visited yesterday and got the lunch special which was a grilled ham and cheese poutine sandwich  which was incredible. Also got buffalo wings and a salad...Also great. My drawbacks are the atmosphere. We sat in the front room which was very weird. We walked around after we ordered, because I am really into the atmosphere of where I choose to eat, and the other room with the fire place and the bar, which I thought was very North woods charming. I think that this place could be a mainstay forever...It truly has that charm. The menu is fantastic and I think the chef really thinks outside of the box. My main issue is the inattention to small details that really make a huge difference. We sat in the front room, in  a booth, and there were about 200 dead mosquitos in the window pane right beside where we were sitting. GROSS. I also think that if you are trying to have staying power, then make your own salad dressings. At least a couple signature dressings. Overall I would go back but the attention to detail and cleanliness is not here. BTW the ladies room was out of hand towels and I had to leave the rest room with dripping wet hands to find someone to give me a paper towel."}
{"text":"The poutine was so good I had to remind myself I was still in the south. Great little restaurant for a nice quiet meal. My meatball hoagie was delicious, and our service was prompt and courteous. I will definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"The omelet was very good but had a little too much grease on the plate. When I was eating and  I turned the omelet over, there was a piece of burn omelet underneath. Everything else was ok. The server was so nice and courteous."}
{"text":"Breakfast was blah. I had flavorless pancakes. Nothing about the place made me or my family want to try it again."}
{"text":"We had the daily special, and salad. It was very good. This is a sleeper. Most food appears to be made from scratch. Reasonably priced, and very good quality. All deserts seem to be homemade, and portioned right, so there's a good price value there too.

Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"I SO thought this was going to be awesome as I've heard great things. Don't know what happened but it was not good. My mother asked what vegetables they had to put in the omelette- LOLLL- and she was told they had nothing \"green\" when she inquired about spinach. So, my mom and I both ordered the chicken wrap and you can choose the sauce you want, we both got a teriyaki sauce. My wrap was served in a puddle of brown liquid- nasty. Neither of us tasted the sauce, maybe that was the brown puddle? The mac & cheese was tasteless too.  They're not cheap & sorry the decor is nothing short of tacky. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Food was good but me and my 5yr old waited over an hour for it.  People that were seated right before us got food and left before ours arrived.  Waiter was nice but only came to our table twice.  Had to go up front and pay bill and it's a pay at the table restaurant.  Bad first time experience..."}
{"text":"At. Had breakfast there yesterday for the first time. Food was very good. Service was excellent. Can't wait to try lunch."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast place!! Great customer service as well as homemade breakfast!! I definitely will be going back here!! You have to try the poutine... I know it sounds funny but it is delicious. French fries with brown gravy on top and cheese as well.  You will not be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"We love the Friendly Moose.  The staff is friendly. We like to go and get breakfast here."}
{"text":"Very good fish and chips, thick pattie melt, crisp tots. Our server was sweet and attentive. Nice outside area and we can bring our dog. Enjoyed."}
{"text":"According to website & posting on Facebook, the Friendly Moose serves breakfast until 2 pm on weekends. This weekend's special was \"Build Your Own Omelet\"...but apparently that is contingent on what the table next to you orders. While I admit that my first visit to the Friendly Moose earlier this month with my friend was an enjoyable one, today's visit with my children was not! I was looking forward to having the omelet special of the day, however, I was told that because the table next to us ordered burgers, I could not order the omelet or any other brunch item for that matter because the grill was full. Granted the table next to us had 8-10 people but to limit other patrons choices because of one table's orders? Furthermore, omelets don't have to be prepared on a grill. At home, I cook omelets on the stovetop in a pan. Very disappointing! We left and not sure we will ever come back!"}
{"text":"Portions seem either to small or to large. There is very limited space within the diner. This is more of an order and pick up place."}
{"text":"We had a very disappointing first meal at The Friendly Moose tonight. The meal was so-so, and the service, while friendly, not terribly good. I will not be back to give them a second chance."}
{"text":"I moved from Chicago to Matthews and this place can hold up against any of Chicago's burger joints. I've only had the Carolina burger (twice) but it was cooked perfect and promtply. 

4 stars until I dine in and can review further - i've only ordered take-out"}
{"text":"My favorite weekend brunch spot!! The first time we visited, I stole my husband's overloaded poutine from him and it has been my go to ever since!  Small place with friendly, attentive service.  They make you feel like family!"}
{"text":"Excellent local place to enjoy some great food. Service is always friendly and great. I have tried a few things on their menu, Burgers, Poutine, Philly Steak. All were great. The poutine is a must try! Also they serve some NoDa brews which good great with the food."}
{"text":"The poutine was excellent, even though that was the first time I had ever had it. My wife really enjoyed her burger and I liked my patty melt on marble rye. If you don't get poutine, I highly recommend getting an order of their sweet potato fries. They were very crispy and not soggy and soft like most sweet potato fries. Good location off Monroe Road, left on potters. In a converted house. Cozy atmosphere. Was a great location to take my family."}
{"text":"Didn't really enjoy their wings, but get the fish and chips!!! Delicious. And I usually don't use tartar sauce, but their's is scrumptious."}
{"text":"Food is decent but not worth the wait. Inexperienced and indifferent staff. Won't visit again."}
{"text":"Second time we've eaten there. I had patty melt once & blue cheese burger this time. Both times I had sweet potato fries. All food was very good."}
{"text":"Good breakfast at a good price. Wife really liked the pancakes. Serving was friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Just had lunch for the first time at The Friendly Moose.  Both food and service were good and prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"Good local place. Food is fast and fresh. Typical bar after breakfast/lunch not a place to take the kids for dinner. Nice wait staff and host - will come back for weekend breakfast."}
{"text":"Cool little local place !!  Great service and friendly staff.    Good breakfast not too crowded, no long waiting .  Great reasonable prices daily specials"}
{"text":"Food is fairly uninspired, but at least they do it right.

This is a bar that masquerades as a little restaurant.  Not that there is anything wrong with that.  The food runs the gamut of bar fare, a little bit of fried, burgers, salads, and soups.  I had the Carolina burger, with red cabbage slaw and a seasoned rather than spicy chili.  The burger was cooked to my preference, and was not from a bubba burger pack.  The fries were nice and the kid that was our server was on top of things.  I just wasn't a big fan of the industrial tables and the menu was just limited.  A little more adventure with that type of execution, the place would be at least 4 stars, if not higher.

But a good place for a quick bite if you just want a burger and beer."}
{"text":"What kind of breakfast restaurant has turkey sausage as a alternative but doesn't offer egg whites?!  The staff was overwhelmed with the crowd and somewhat unprofessional.  Very disappointed, 1st time and last time."}
{"text":"I have lived out in Union County for a long time, I have seen businesses come and go from this spot. I decided to give it a try, lots of cars in the parking lot. It was ok...mostly bar food.  Service was fair at best. They have GOT to get the AC to keep this place cooler. Maybe I would go again but maybe not. We had nachos, fish and chips and some wings. Just about the same as any other place like this. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Went to the friendly moose for lunch the food was excellent and the service was top-notch."}
{"text":"Wife and I saw good reviews on this restaurant and decided to give it a shot.  Very friendly service. Very good prices. Very good food. 

Recommend for anyone in the area."}
{"text":"Cheap booze, friendly bartenders, great food.  Not a bad place to spend time, and after a couple visits you honestly feel like part of one big Moose family."}
{"text":"Glad to see a local place make good food!

Good value, good service, surprising quality on the food. The home made potato chips were awesome, the chicken noodle soup was homemade and delicious, and the grilled chicken wrap was very good!  Deserts are over the top too! The moose tracks mousse is amazing."}
{"text":"This restaurant was extremely disappointing.  I had a hamburger that I ordered medium rare.  It came out raw and inedible with no garnish, no dressing, etc.  I asked for garnish and received wilted/rotten lettuce, the ends of pickles and a tomato.  My husband ordered \"The Beard\" which sounded great per the description, but unfortunately was not great at all.  The entire dish was microwaved so it was cold in the middle and hot around the edges.  He was told the gravy was made in-house but we found out it was powdered and it tasted like it.  We asked to speak to the chef/cook who came out and we explained our situation.  He said \"oh, sorry about that\" but didn't seem to care at all.  The waiter was very nice and said he wished we had said something before we paid and he would have given us a discount.  We normally wouldn't have said anything but we wanted them to know how terrible our meals were.  Unfortunately no one seemed to care.  We were not even offered a free dessert!  If we were, we wouldn't have accepted it anyway but it would have been nice.  I would avoid this restaurant if you are looking for fresh, good food."}
{"text":"First time here. I had the burger, fries and chili. Wife had the chicken wrap and fries. Everything was very good for the price."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service ....nice small bar where everyone knows your name hahaha we had a great server and the sandwiches we had were great ....the patty melt and philly cheese steak....sorry to say the chili was not great"}
{"text":"I was with my parents and my aunt and we were looking for somewhere in Indian Trail to eat for some reason every restaurant we went to were closed and then we came across The Friendly Moose and I'm really glad we did. Looking at it from the outside it just looks like an old house which I'm pretty sure it is however, once you get inside you will quickly notice that it is a moose inspired decorated restaurant.  I am a foodie, so I have seen poutine  before on TV but have never tried it so I was really excited to see it on a menu here in North Carolina as I know it is mostly in the northern states. and it did not disappoint, it was absolutely delicious the gravy was homemade the fries were crispy and the cheese just made the whole dish I also am an avid pot sticker fan, so I was super excited to see if they also had those on on the menu I ordered the pot stickers and a chef salad for my entree and my aunt ordered the fish and chips and both of my parents ordered a burger. The portions were huge and we were all more than satisfied the food was also delicious and you could tell it was prepared with care, nothing tasted frozen or like it came from a can it all tasted fresh prepared hot and delicious.  This will definitely be one of our new go-to spots in the Indian Trail area I cannot wait to try it again as soon as possible.  By the way, none of the actual burgers with the name moose in them are prepared with moose it's all ground beef."}
{"text":"The Friendly Moose is a hidden gem in Stallings. It's location is only a couple miles off the Matthews Exit of 74 right next to the Grand Asia Market. 

The food is fresh and home made including all the desserts (which most restaurants don't do these days...usually you get frozen and factory made stuff). 

I had one of the salads which was the \"Moose House\" Salad with sirloin tips and a side of blue cheese crumbles with a balsamic vinaigrette. Everything was very fresh and the meat was flavorful. 

My husband had the special of the day which was a prime rib sandwich with Sweet Potato fries which were dusted in brown sugar and cinnamon. Both were excellent. 

I especially appreciated the dessert: Peanut butter cream pie. The flavor was delicious and again tasted freshly made. As I said before was made in house but I especially was glad that it was in a 6\" dish and was only $1.95. I do not want to eat a 900 calorie dessert that costs almost as much as my meal, instead I want something that satisfies my sweet tooth and is well priced. My spouse had the Key lime pie which was the same situation: small, inexpensive and delicious. 

Cost wise it's a bargain. I had two glasses of wine, my husband had two beers, we both had an entree and a dessert and the total was only $38 before tip. I went to a chain restaurant last week, by myself, had an appetizer and a salad and two classes of wine and paid just a little less than this... and the food was only sort of ok, not really good as this place!

There is also free Wi Fi access through out the restaurant and the bar area has cell phone and iPad chargers lining the walls. 

The owner John, who also acted as our waiter, is from Toronto, and so if you happen to be a Canadian looking for a \"home food\" fix they actually have Poutine on the Menu (which for the uninitiated is a plate of french fries topped with fresh cheese curds and brown gravy... if you have never had this dish before you are missing out on a weird but very tasty culinary creation) 

My spouse had been here a couple times since this restaurant changed owners and had been trying to get me to stop here, but I had not gotten around to it. Wow do I wish I had listened to him earlier."}
{"text":"This place has to have the most friendly people to take you order on Saturday morning. Sherri was our waitress. I let her know this was our first time after passing it several times in the last 2 years since they have been open. We were there for breakfast 2 eggs and country ham and hash browns. Everything was plentiful and cooked perfectly. The restaurant was very clean. The outside may not draw you in .. But once  inside it will keep you coming back. The food and the people make this a place to go over and over."}
{"text":"This is a funny place:  It is located at a busy intersection on its own lot.  It is a house with a restaurant in it.  There is a large stuffed moose sticking out of the wall facing you and when you turn the corner you are greeted with the rear end of the moose.

Children especially get a kick out of the moose.

The food is very good.  The menu has the array of sandwiches, stews and salads and on some days they have a brunch/breakfast buffet.  What we had was excellent all around.

Service is warmly completed by an owner or child of owner, so you are actually eating their food in their house...plus the moose.

We were visiting my dad in Novant Presbyterian Hospital, just a couple of miles away, so this is a great convenience to hospital visitors looking for a good meal without fanciness."}
{"text":"So we've driven by this place for years. It was always the place my wife and I said, \"we'll check that out next time\". I cannot believe that we waited this long!!! It was so fun and delicious.
  To start with it looks like an old house(because it is)and you have no idea what kind of food they serve.  
  When we walked in, we were immediately greeted by a very awake and polite host that turned out to be our server. 
 The dining area is small , but not confined. A single open door  in the dining room is the entrance to a full bar area. ( local hang out for sure!) It could be a turn off for families coming to eat. The noise of the bar flys and TV's could be heard while eating. We didn't mind. 
  The menu was perfect for my wife and I . She is from Newfoundland and I am from GA.  One side of the menu you have poutine and the other is chicken and waffles!!! Perfect for us!!!
I ended up with a perfect black and blue burger that I am sure to order again. We also had chicken wings that were amazing!!! Several flavours to choose from.
  The decor is just fun. We sat underneath a giant moose head (fake) , when I went to the restroom , I saw that the other side of the wall had the other end of the moose sticking out. hilarious !!!  
  This may have been our first time , but will not be our last."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food and great prices. Definitely a unique place and usually pretty slow but overall I've only had good experiences! The meatball subs are soooo good! Good for lunch dinner or drinks."}
{"text":"Loved their wings, huge, juicy, and perfectly cooked. When I asked for mild. .. Perfect amount of heat! Their coleslaw is home made and again the flavor and texture were spot on. Bacon all I can say is WOW!! I want it for breakfast ( which they serve by the way) a snack or salad.  Hand made burger so I was able to get a medium rare and it was perfect! Moose Burger had tomato onion crisp,  lettuce and a fried egg on thick cut roasted bread that was a pleasure to eat on its own.  This place can't be beat in the area for quantity,  quality and cost for a fantastic meal! Love the waitress and didn't have to wait long at all.  Come on in! The vibe here is wonderful,  they have a really neat patio and a small bar in the back.  Would recommend this to anyone and everyone for breakfast lunch dinner and Late night.  The regulars end up coming here to work and they hang out here when they are off... always a good sign! Live bands and karaoke too. I like a quiet night so Wednesday worked for me.  I'll be back :)"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've visited and today I was reminded why. This place is near my house, so the convenience has brought me in multiple times. Breakfast isn't always the best and today was the final straw. I ordered an omelette (with cheese). The cheese was plopped on top and it was greasy and looked disgusting plus my food was cold by the time I got it. The service at this place has always been poor. Typically they are under staffed so you wait for a long time to place your order, get food and especially refills on your drink. I've tried to give them multiple chances but after today I'm done with this place. The prices for the quality of food are not worth it at all. I guess their bar business must do well because they continue to stay open, it's certainly not because of the food or service."}
{"text":"Great prices. Even better food. Attentive service. Try the pie."}
{"text":"For $7.00 the corned beef hash was a major disappointment.  One spoon of hash and they put the bread on the side so you don't see that you got 1/2 plate of food for exorbitant prices. Food was freezing cold. Sausage patties had weird taste that I cannot quite put my finger on. If you want a good hot breakfast,  you're better off GOING ANYWHERE ELSE!! BEWARE!"}
{"text":"My friends brought me here early on a Saturday morning and I was happy they did! The restaurant is literally in a house and you quickly feel like you are at home. The staff were amazing and the food was too! I got the breakfast poutine and the was amazing! The omelette's are huge!"}
{"text":"Came for Sunday breakfast. The food was good and the staff was friendly.  The food was served within 15 minutes of us walking in the door."}
{"text":"My rating is based on a one-time visit, but it really was a home run for us.  I came with 3 girlfriends for breakfast and we were all very happy with our food.  I thought the prices were extremely reasonable (the total for the 4 of us was just over $30), especially for the quality of food.  While their biscuits weren't the best I've ever had, they were very food. But it was the grits that knocked my socks off.  They were perfect, perfect grits.  Our server and all the wait staff we encountered were so friendly and accommodating.  She kept our beverages filled and was attentive without being over bearing.  On the subject of beverages, I really liked that they had French vanilla creamers on the table - it was like having a little latte!  The décor is kind of kitschy, but also clean and tasteful.  There are moose all over the place, but yet it's still pretty modern inside.  We sat under this huge stuffed moose mounted on the wall with a tv broadcasting a fire in the fireplace.  It was just hilarious and I've never seen anything like it.  I thought this place was a real find and I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Kind of just okay.  the waiter was obnoxious. He siad it was his 3rd day and when we told him it was our first time there he acted like we were an inconvenience. He tried really hard to hard sell us on appetizers and didn't let us sit and actually think about what we wanted to drink. When we told him we need a couple of min to look at the menu he stood there leaning on our table pushing apps. When we told him we were ready to order he said okay I have to go get my pad and walked away.  When the food finally came out (seemes like a pretty long wait) the poutine had about 3x the gravy it needed making it a soggy mess...the gravy tasted like cambells beef gravy... I ordered wings med and maple whisky flavored...the med were ok the sauce masked the dryness, but the maple whiskey were apparently dry rub...and very very overcooked. My husband ordered a black bean burger with lettuce cheese and ranch dressing, He got a very overcooked dry patty on a bun...when he said its supposed to have cheese and lettuce and ranch the waiter brought out a plate with a piece of lettuce a piece of tomato a slice of cheese and some blue cheese dressing. 
I think the place is very cute...but parking was atrocious. The stairs outside do not make it handicapp accessible and the fooD seemed just ok. some other plates that passed by us looked good...Meatball sub looked delish....so maybe try that if you go there. Don't really see us going back there, just not sure if it warrants another try."}
{"text":"Tucked away, unassuming spot for morning, afternoon or nighttime fun. Inexpensive  and good food, great drinks, the friendliest staff and fun outdoor patio (with occasional amazing live music) to fit all needs. A great neighborhood spot!"}
{"text":"Great service, fairly good food, and very reasonable prices. The place had a little bit of an odd smell to it (musty-ish) but not enough that I wouldn't return. It is a  drive from Charlotte but we happened to be close by so it worked out well, I am not sure I would make the drive just to eat.  

Perhaps the least-expensive wine I have ever seen on any menu - at under $4 a glass. We started with the poutine which reminded me of gravy fries (a  good  thing)- though I too would have preferred to sample the classic with traditional curds . I had the wings which were crisp, but the blue cheese & ranch ( I tried both) were not very good, and certainly not homemade as many people commented most things were. I wish every wing place would just use the classic Buffalo sauce base - Franks Red Hot, but hey that's just my preference.   I will second that their home made chips were great and I would love to try the pie if I return -our server said it's the best!  

All in all a solid 3.5 !"}
{"text":"Visited for the first time 2 weeks ago, had the burger and it was really good. Service was friendly, but soooo sloooow (I can't stand waiting a long time for food to come out.) Fries were good too. Nachos were a bit odd - they kind of just disintegrate as you eat them, crumbly, not crisp. Not a big deal, just personal preference. Picante sauce for the nachos was good (tasted like Pace picante sauce, which I like).  Went a second time tonight, as my in-laws were in town and they like good burgers (I had talked them up). Unfortunately, on this occasion everyone's burger buns were literally sopping/soaked with grease. I kid you not, it was as if the cook had used the buns to clean his grill before he put the patties on them - gross! I ended up just using a fork to eat the beef patty (which still tasted good), but the bun was so gross. The staff was very friendly, again, but the cook was very slow (again) and they weren't busy. I don't think I'll be going back, unfortunately, as it just wasn't a great night and on top of that, I was a little embarrassed that I had brought my in-laws."}
{"text":"The staff here is very friendly. It must be because they've been hanging out with the moose. Or perhaps it is the poutine. Not many places in the Charlotte area serve poutine, and all that gravy probably helps with being friendly. 

While the staff was busy being friendly, and the location is well-situated, the building itself is a bit odd - it's like an old home that was turned into a restaurant (not that there is anything wrong with that), because there is a front room where you walk in and... nothing. You just have to wait until someone realizes you are there, since all the action seems to be happening somewhere else. Things are just chopped up and so the flow is all wrong. Where are the feng shui experts to fix this problem? The moose out front is good, the flow inside is just not working.

Once the seating was worked out, and the food on its way, all was good in the world - the prices were decent and food came out quickly. Nothing fancy here, to be sure, and you probably would not expect it what with a near life-sized moose in front. But probably somewhere that you should not miss if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Our family loved our experience here (3 kids). The service was fast, the food was great, and we even had a chance to talk to the owner. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Great place! Best poutine I've had in the states period. And it's hard to impress a Canadian with that kind of thing"}
{"text":"We did try this place again and sadly it was bad the second time too.  My food again  was not cooked correctly but this time it was not done.  When it finally came back out, my husband was done eating and had to watch me eat.  Again, no apologies from management although this waitress did take my food off the bill.  Obviously, customer satisfaction and quality control aren't something they care much about!  Not going to go back for a 3rd bad meal."}
{"text":"My husband and I have seen this place on Yelp many times and finally tried it for breakfast! The good reviews proved true! I had an omelette and my husband had a breakfast plate. It was all very good! Homey atmosphere, outdoor patio area, and great service. We'll be back again!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch and had absolutely terrible service. The server was nice but incredibly slow. I ordered the breakfast poutine and it was awful. The toast and biscuits were so stale. Pancakes were also bad. Would not recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"Very good burgers, but unless you have a Groupon, you'll spend more than you might have planned. Excellent onion rings, but you pay a premium (not a regular side dish).  It's an old renovated house, so it's very noisy. You can hear all conversations around you, including uncontrolled children.  There is an outside patio, but have never been out there. No ambience, but again, the food is good and cooked to order."}
{"text":"Great food and environment. It felt like home when I was eating there. I ordered their fish and chips, fish was great but I think their chips can still be improved (some were crispy and some were not, a little bit too greasy for me, could be just my personal preference) Good restaurant to try out anyway."}
{"text":"The Friendly Moose is charming with it's strikingly realistic plush mooseheads all over the walls and authenticly sweet wait staff. Moose's breakfast is spot on; fluffy pancakes (splurge and order the chocolate chips), big portions, perfectly brewed coffee...I could go on and on. At these low prices I can see myself becoming a regular!"}
{"text":"Best beer - battered onion rings ever! Fried items perfectly fried on all three visits. Would be 5 stars, but menu is a bit cumbersome...too many items."}
{"text":"Perfect place to go for breakfast on a nice day - they have a very comfy open air patio out back. How can they serve such a great breakfast for under $4? I asked the giant stuffed moose but he just looked at me. Not friendly at all. Should be called The Mute Moose. Love this place anyway :)"}
{"text":"This is a bar and restaurant serving up cordial service and daily specials.  There is an inside bar area, dining area, and outdoor patio.  The space is large and there is ample room to spread out.  

The food is bar food, but there are some pretty tasty choices.  The nachos are my go to. They  are portioned large and include plenty to share with a few people.  They have always tasted delicious.  

The service is good, they can get very crowded on weekends.  I have usually gone around happy hour throughout the week and had no issues."}
{"text":"As a proud canadian I just had to try this place. Especially since I'm a mile away. Anyway, started with a classic poutine. Quite good really, just miss the original with curds instead. Tasty starter!  I had a burger and it was cooked to perfection, as was the steak my wife had. Overall it's good food and a good value."}
{"text":"Went here end of 2013 and will not be back.  Got the Poutine which is their signature item.  Its a Canadian classic, supposed to be cheese curds on fries with gravy.  This place used what tastes like Heinz canned beef gravy over fries with shredded mozzarella sprinkled on it.  Gross.  Too lazy to make homemade gravy and use real cheese curds?  Why even bother offering it then?  Thats like moving to Europe and opening a pizza joint and serving Totinos pizzas.  Got the meatball sandwich as well.  The meatballs were so tasteless and bland I couldn't believe my taste buds.  They taste premade and frozen.....and I say premade because I doubt anything that bland would actually be sold by a food distributor...so it has to be a homemade recipe but they taste like they have no Parmesean cheese or salt in them.....definitely no veal....just bland ground beef and bread crumbs.  We ordered some wings which  were okay but when we asked the waiter if we could get 1/2 one flavor 1/2 another he said \"well, you could....but it might piss off the cook, they dont like doing that\".  WTF?  I'm not trying to get my food spit in so....nevermind.  Got some sorta chocolate mousse dessert.  It ended up being chocolate pudding with chocolate chips in it.  Gross.  It was china buffet quality pudding....straight out of a giant refrigerated container.

This place is odd.  The building is like an old funereal home or something and the seating inside is weird.  Its almost like they must have something else going on to even exist.....like video poker or something in the back because I cant see how they stay in business with just the food.  Sorry =/"}
{"text":"Had a chance to check out the Friendly Moose for the first time last weekend. Great food!! Also very friendly staff, actually sat down with us for a minute and got to know us. Make sure and try the Poutine, you'll be glad u did."}
{"text":"Food was good but not a big variety of things to choose from. More burgers than real entrees"}
{"text":"Really great local Matthews bar. They have friendly service and awesome food for the value. Their inferno wings are actually really HOT!!!!!

They have a great outdoor patio too!!!"}
{"text":"This is such a unique place in somewhat of a random location--tucked between matthews and Indian Trail and Stallings.  It looks like an old ranch home that has likely been there since the early 1900's.  When you first enter you are literally greeted with a \"friendly moose\" that sits right in the front lobby.  The staff greeted us immediately and sat us in what would have been the living room of this home transformed.  

We were given both the breakfast and the lunch menu but opted for the breakfast.  I ordered the breakfast that came with three eggs any style, bacon and 3 pancakes.  All for the low price of $6.95.  You can't even find that at McDonald's!!  I expected the pancakes to be thin and flimsy but they were the opposite.  They were thick...almost too thick for my taste.  I couldn't even eat one!  They were so compacted I could hardly swallow each bite!  I guess that could be a good thing for others?

Husband ordered the french toast AND a Bacon egg and cheese.  He wasn't playing around.  The B,E &C could be served on a bagel, biscuit, white bread, english muffin, wheat bread, etc.  He went with the wheat bread and it wasn't the little piece of toast you get as a side at most restaurants, it was a full blown huge sandwich.  The french toast was texas toast battered and smothered with powdered sugar.  He enjoyed it very much.

The service was so friendly and the prices were amazing.  The atmosphere is pretty bootlegg and let's be honest, these ingredients are not likely super fresh, homemade or anything \"special\" in general.  However, for a nice hearty breakfast that is basic and still very good and very cheap....this is the spot."}
{"text":"Place was nice. Bartenders were friendly. They had a great, blonde colored stout! Loved it! 

What struck me as odd was the moment I walked in, the DJ came off as a bit racist, however. The moment I walked into the bar, the DJ was hanging at the bar. Out of nowhere he began asking me where I am from. When I walked away, it appeared as if he was making fun of me with one of his friends. Afterwards, he came over to our table and began saying words in Korean. I don't know if it was his intension to be offensive or whether he was drunk, but it made my first and so far, only visit to this nice place quite uncomfortable. What's ironic is this place is right next to an Asian market."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a Saturday. Would go back.

Pretty solid all around. Both sandwiches were first rate. I'll give it an extra star since they have some nice, small desserts that were tasty and inexpensive. Much better than some places that sell a piece of pie for $6.95.

Update - My wife tried chicken and waffles for the first time ever on a recent trip. Now, she gets it every time we go."}
{"text":"Omelets and hash browns are good. Though owned by Canadians, I would avoid the poutine - it's not the real thing. They can't get good cheese curds around here. Cute place for breakfast."}
{"text":"Breakfast in Matthews and the main reason I chose this cute little spot was because they were a) well reviewed and b) they have wifi.

As much as I've missed poutine since I spent a few weeks in the Great White North, I chose a classic American breakfast. My eggs were a little greasy but the rest of the meal (turkey sausage, tater tots and toast) was cooked perfectly. Absolutely delicious. Gallons of coffee.

I do love getting called \"Darling\" and \"Sweetie\" by the wait staff."}
{"text":"Now that I've been there five times, I'll put in my 2-cents.  This is a pleasant spot with friendly service, reasonable prices, in a clean environment.  The food is tasty, with a few, somewhat unconventional items for you to try.  I haven't taken advantage of the bar that's in a smallish, attached room with a nicely stocked bar and good drink prices posted on the board.  $2 for bottled Moosehead!
I have noticed that the service can be a bit slow from not having enough staff on-hand.  If you're in a hurry, you may want to ask."}
{"text":"A great place with good food, friendly people, and french fries with brown gravy. They got 4 stars just for that alone. Plus they are now on Groupon so you get to check it out and realize just what you've been missing. Remember the fries with gravy and finish with the pie!"}
{"text":"Great French fries with gravy and cheese. The onion rings were good too. I also had the mashed potatoes with cheese and pulled pork. I thought there was a little too much garlic but was still good. 

Great service too."}
{"text":"Normally enjoy breakfast here but not this time.   Slow service and the food was just not good.  The worst part was nobody seemed to care.  We were headed to another place but changed our mind.  Big mistake.  I can deal with ok food when people are concerned and try to make things better.     The owner needs to take a serious look at his/her operation.  And clean up the restroom, it's definitely been overlooked."}
