{"text":"We booked a celebration for 20 people.  The staff gladly met with us and we preselected items for the customized menu to suit all tastes. On the day the service was outstanding.  The atmosphere was cozy and warm with a piano player in the background.  The food - too good to describe.  The view is looking over the golf course.  A beautiful setting.  If you are looking for a European experience, this is it!  Everyone in our party commented on the food, staff, setting and restaurant as being wonderful.  Special thanks to Bronia and Martin who truly care about the customer. Also - not French food as listed but Czech."}
{"text":"what happens when you phone a restaurant to pre-order ahead and upon arrival no prep. Work has been done for you.  What happens when you call 4x and talk to too many and they give you assumption that upon arrival that a plate of food will be nicely done and you are famished on a late Friday, but yet again nothing was done.  You ask them \"why\", their rude, incomprehensible response is \" we don't know you and you eat when everyone eats \"  Since WHEN Does a restaurant has everyone eating at EXActly the SAme TIme!!!!!!  If you are not Czech or East European, you will be better off eating at a local burger joint with a friendly hello and much efficient hospitality and satisfaction.  Near full house, no happy looking faces and it was near/pass 7:30Pm., not in the mood with their low class off the scale inhospitable treatment, I left for others to fend for themselves esp. The 2 hostesses married but the wife did not side with me.  Much too stupid and lack of maturity to run a dinner club, wish it/she gets kick off the site, she has trouble getting people to rejoin her for other gatherings, it shows!  By the way, photographs displayed after their dinner were pathetic (A piece of overly cooked meat and a FEW PIECES OF CARROTS, CELERY, ONION.  I am not a trained chef, but even I CAN PRODUCE A FAB MEAL WITH SAVOURY SAUCE, UNBELIVEABLE HOW SOME RESTOS AS SUCH TRIES TO GET AWAY WITH THIS. )  Total WASTE OF TIME MONEY AND TOO MUCH HEALTHY AIR USED UP BY UNGRATEFUL UNDESIRABLES IN OUR BEAUTIFUL T.O. SCARB., ON.  HOPE public health puts final nail on this place.  Also, I had some difficulty finding place because it's local is at the end of a Dead end street, no signs visible, a somewhat friendly lady with her dog helped by directing me to, but she said this resto is all Czech, and then she smiled and left.  It was a sign that I should have turned around right away to leave instead of a total waste of my time. And starvation of madness!!!  They should know never cross a women in this fashion!!! .  Had to go back home 1.5Hrs. Later to order wholesome chinese food and destroy a perfectly restored pair of $150 Old shoes, sole and heel fell apart walking on their EXTREMELY POORLY PAVED STREET/DRIVEWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Brilliant food and service. Came here for a birthday party and I cannot get the wonderful tasting food out of my palette or dreams. We were served by a wonderful young ( and beautiful! ) girl who I think was named Emily??? -- At any rate she was so wonderful and took the time to explain all the dishes to us ( as we are west indian and had no clue )  I had the beef stroganoff and it was amazing. My wife had the cheese schnitzel and it was the BOMB.COM!!! My brother had the perogies and they even were so sweet to bring out a free dessert for him cause it was his birthday. Dinner for 3 with a bottle of wine, after dinner drinks and a beer was only $100 (before tax n tip) that is a steal of a deal, They have a wonderful outdoor patio/verandah that overlooks a grass valley of a golf course with nice views. I highly recommed this place and we will be back several times. Great food and service."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem... Came here on a cold January night and had an amazing Czech meal that warmed me right up. The perogies are on point!! The wiener schitzel was pretty delish as well, crisp on the outside but tender on the inside. And omg if you're trying to decide on desserts, please just order everything."}
{"text":"Just visited Prague restaurant after almost 10years. Lot of changes and fortunately all of them are positive. I would start with a new owner and very good services... that should be the main reason for everybody who heard about the place in past to come and give it a seceond chance.  I hope it will remain as it is now - friendly staff, very good Czech kitchen and reasobable prices.  For anyone new, who never heard of the Prague restaurant, definitely try it. Very good european dishes and great beer picks on tap."}
{"text":"Nice on a snowy evening - very remote and quiet - traditional Czech and Slovak food.  They know how to make very simple things taste great."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant, good food, nice set up and pleasant patio with a view on a quiet park. Good service."}
{"text":"The better variety of Czech food. The staff is very friendly and attentive. This is one and only restaurant with authentic Czech food in Toronto region."}
{"text":"Jak se m√°te? Impressive, huh? I know. Anyway, the Czech are not known for veggies or salads (I should know) - so really come here expecting to eat meat. You will be glad you did. First phone before you go because they often have private functions. It's a bit of a round about way to drive to, and you park next to the restaurant (you'll see this little sort of gazebo thingy next to the parking lot) pass that down the hill, to the second door for the restaurant entrance. There are coat racks there you can leave your stuff on. You'll be greeted by one of the two women who work there. They will seat you - and if you're in the in-crowd, you may even be fortunate enough to be seated with a view of the (actually much more scenic than it sounds) Scarborough Golf Club. Since we all know that Czech beer is the best, you need to order some. How? Pivo prosim (beer please). Then you should order the breaded mushrooms (you don't need 'em but they are tasty). Then, just go for the gold, get your money's worth and order the Bohemian Platter for Two ($29.50 - a great price). On it, you'll get:  Pork schnitzel, two kinds of roasted meat, two kinds of cabbage (zeli - the purple is my fave) topped with debrecine sausage and served with home fried potatoes and dumplings. If you're a suck (or skinny) just order the pork roast with purple sauerkraut (still zeli) so tender, juicy and flavourful, balanced by the crunchy tartness of the cabbage. Yum! Oh, and if you can manage - order dessert - get the crepes with apricot jam (although I do want to try to strawberry dumplings, I'm sure they'll be good too). Go for a nice stroll after dinner - you'll need it to work off all that yummy food!"}
{"text":"2nd time here with a group. Sizzling mushrooms excellent but service is slow & drink selection poor & stingy in alcoholic & non alcoholic. Menu says coolers, there are none. \"Manhatan\" was 2 sips. Diet coke was warm even with ice cubes in a tiny glass. Beef stroganoff had tiny pieces of beef, hardly any mushrooms, no noodles & thin bland sauce with no sour cream. It was mostly celery & green peppers. Schnitzel was the only generous serving. Cook & staff have let what should be a good ethnic restaurant run down. They even let the paper towels in the women's washroom run out."}
