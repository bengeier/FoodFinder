{"text":"This was one of the worst dining experience I have had in a long time. At the prices they are charging, and considering that there are LOTS of other very good restaurants in downtown Cleveland, I was very disappointed in the the quality and taste of the food. My husband ordered the roasted garlic boston strip and I had the lobster macaroni. The marinade they used on the steak was disgusting. The mashed potatoes they served with the steak was tasteless and the texture was telling that the mashed potatoes came straight out of the box. The lobster macaroni was flavorless. The sauce was kind of watery and very bland. It needed more seasoning like salt. If I could give it zero stars I would. I will never go there again and I would not recommend this place to anyone I know."}
{"text":"This was the only place open on a Sunday downtown.

The service was good, but the food was just plain.  Seemed a bit overpriced for the portion and the quality."}
{"text":"Somehow Waterstreet is the only casual eatery in the warehouse district.  Every other place to eat is either bar food or an upscale, and thus pricy, restaurant which makes it a critical element of downtown living.

I've done breakfast, lunch amd dinner each there a few times.  Waterstreet is without a doubt the preferred choice for a hangover breakfast for anyone who lives within walking distance.  Saturday and Sunday for brunch this place is pretty full of glazed-eyed 20 somethings who are there b/c they read their text messages from the night before and realized they had drunkenly promised 5 of their friends to do brunch at waterstreet the next morning

Katelyn B is right that the spinach and artichoke dip is really good.  Some of the salads I've had were good, as is the gnocchi, all of the breakfast wraps, the mussels and some of the pastas.

For dinner it's a good segue into going out as the beer is pretty cheap (3 for domestics and 4 for imports).  A drawback is that they don't have anything on tap."}
{"text":"very disappointed. Was recommended to us by a person at the hotel, and honestly I would not recommend going here at all. My girlfriends breakfast was swimming in salsa sauce, like they were trying to cover up for a lack of flavor. The french toast was OK at best. Our service was not the friendliest I have ever had either."}
{"text":"Had the gyro omelet. Delicious.
Went on a Saturday morning, and we were seated/served promptly.   Love the decor of the place.

Perfect place   to help you forget the fact that you slept in a cramped Durango in the parking lot next door.........."}
{"text":"Casual eatery with slightly inflated prices (due to its downtown location). I have always been pleasently pleased but not blown away with the food. I do remember they always  have HUGE portions. 

They have a nice rice bowl or salad selection."}
{"text":"Mac 'n cheese.  So good.  So tasty.  So cheese-blend saucy.  So rich & creamy.  So not from a blue box.
The mac'n cheese is nothing fancy but its penne in a real presumably roux-based cheese sauce with a kick of garlic.  it's perfect when you're in the mood for something really rich and creamy but totally comforting.  perfect with a dash of tobasco!
People rave about their brunch but I don't think it's anything great.  The menu is standard and fairly small - a few omelets, bagels (generic, nothing special), french toast, and maybe some heartier dishes, but nothing especially interesting or different."}
{"text":"I go to Waterstreet for one reason.

The spinich and artichoke dip. If you are a fan of this dish, run to this restaurant now. Now I realize that you can get this dish at basically any restaurant, but for some reason this one is outstanding. The fresh pita grilled pita that comes with it is an added plus, and I am intriuged at how it tasts so good. 

I can not really tell you about any of the other food, I had a southwest salad that was pretty typical, tasty, but typical. Word on the grapevine is that they have good breakfast. 

The place is cute, very old style downtown, I could have done without the TV at the bar, but I guess that is how they get business."}
{"text":"Breakfast - The WSG Little Boy ain't little!  It's fabulous and the $5.95 price is unbelievable!

Lunch - Soup n' Sandwich is the right move."}
{"text":"A \"take it or leave it\" kind of place, for sure. 

I'm a champion for any local biz around Cleveland, but some just don't really do it for me. I don't hate Waterstreet by any means, I just can't see myself recommending it to someone, especially since I only come here when there are no other options. 

We stopped in for lunch a couple of days ago (again, because it was just the easiest solution) and had another unmemorable experience. The tuna melt was relatively tasteless, although spot on with the mayo-to-tuna ratio, in my opinion. Nothing makes me gag worse than over use of mayo on a sandwich. This was basically toasted rye bread, a slice of melted cheddar and swiss and tuna salad with hardly any seasoning. Not bad, but no great either. 

The real winner of the lunch was the delightful side salad. I'm a huge fan of a nice, fresh healthy salad and this one had chickpeas. Yum! You rarely see this around CLE. There was no cheese, croutons or other calorie-ridden add on's and that was nice. 

Service? Well, the staff was very sweet and thoughtful, but that can't really save a restaurant, can it? I don't think so. We sat at the bar and the girl serving us was a peach. She did get our salad dressing wrong and forgot to give us silverware, but those aren't really things I'm too uptight about. Honest mistakes. 

Waterstreet serves a purpose for the Warehouse District I suppose. It's open when other spots in the immediate area are not (i.e. Sunday Brunch, late night, etc.) It's priced too high for what it is, but not fancy enough to merit a date night out meal. Overall I'd rather drive elsewhere to spend my money on a meal I thoroughly enjoy, but that's just me.

Oh, I almost forgot: they have cheap carry-out wine. Love that!"}
{"text":"Brunch: Food is alright, but ... service is terrible! It's sad, because it's one of the only reasonably priced brunch places downtown.  

If you want brunch, I would recommend going to Constantinos, buying some food, and saving yourself the misery of dealing with their wait staff.  If you are dining in, and want some more coffee - walk across the street to Phoenix, order there, drink it there, and walk back.  Sadly, you'll make it back to your table before their wait staff will have checked in with you. 

Dinner: Avoid - you can find much better food, at the same prices elsewhere."}
{"text":"I've eaten here for lunch a lot recently.  The location is right across the street from where I live.  That's really the only reason I've been back.  Food is nothing special, service was not great considering the place was practically empty.  I've had the pasta (big portion, but lacking in taste), the pizza (you're better off buying a frozen DiGiorno and putting it in the oven), the salmon gyro (surprisingly good).  Overall, nice people that work there, just nothing special."}

IN THE FORM OF GREATNESS
Sunday Funday (check), Blood Orange Mimosas (check), Lox no capers with an English muffin (check), sitting amongst hungover friends (check), wearing the same outfit as the night before (check), Bloody Mary bar (check plus).  Yes, take notes for this cornucopia is bursting with every ingredient imaginable, even some you pick up and ask your friend \"now what do I do with this?\"  Either way this Bloody Mary bar takes the cake.  Victory is mine (insert Stewie Griffin voice).  

MIXED FEELINGS
Nothing particularly noteworthy from a dining perspective yet I find myself here at least a few times a month.

BAD TO THE BONE
Yes, you caught me.  For I am the girl circling the block 6 times before I find a spot to park while shaking my finger and cursing at the parking attendant for trying to charge me 8 bucks.  For Pete's sake that's already half the amount I plan to spend IN the restaurant.  Poof.

peace, blessing, salad dressing

{"text":"Waterstreet is like a journeyman right fielder with a .220 average.  WS will get a hit once in a while, hit a couple of accidental homeruns a year, but is pretty average  (at best) in the food deptartment.  The decor is a bizzare mismatch of colors, lights and assorted crap that screams \"look what I found! ...lets put it HERE -wait- no- HERE... ... no - there...  oh look! A nail is here already in the wall... perfect!  

And I hate pre-cooked anything, especially  pre-cooked breakfast sausages, which they use.  

Weekend mornings are an interesting mix of hungover fratboys and woogirls walking bowlegged from the previous night.  

and for whatever reason, you get french fries with breakfast!?!?!?

Carry on."}
{"text":"I like the look and feel of this place, kind of like a \"Cheers\" feel to it. The manager and server were super nice. It's always nice to feel welcomed when you walk in the door! We started with the fried mozzarella which was surprisingly good. The marinara was fresh and definitely not from a jar as it had a true tomato taste to it. Nice. For my main plate I had the fish n chips. I have to say, although the filet's were 'cut' sort of weird (pizza slice shaped..it's true) this may possibly be the best fish n chips I've had. The fish itself had the perfect mild flavor and the batter was perfectly done. Not oily or too heavy in texture. Most other places I have ordered this serve 75% batter and 25% fish. This was the opposite and really done close to perfection. Honestly, I'm not sure how it could be done any better. The fries were ok but should have been cooked longer. Let me not forget the slaw. I am not a slaw eater at all and most of the time this is left on my plate but not here. It was creamy, crunchy and fresh. I liked it! 

My partner had the Patty Melt, what should be a classic. Not so much here. The beef was this huge \"pub\" burger. Cool, yeh? No, it had zero flavor. She had me try a bite to confirm. None! So after scrapping off the mushrooms (yes, they come on the \"Patty Melt\") she proceeded to eat with her burger in one hand and the pepper bottle in the other. Pour pepper, take a bite, pour pepper, take a bite. 

*Cool note; they have a treasure chest full of toys by the door for kids to pick a toy from. Really fun idea. 

We'll most likely go back, but not until we've explored all of the other spots in the warehouse district. This was our first venture to this area and I have to say I'm really excited to go back and explore!! We're already planning to take a day this summer and create our own walking \"Taste of Cleveland\" downtown. Food, cocktails, food, cocktails!! I'm in."}
{"text":"Yeah, I didn't really care for this place.

The restaurant itself is nice- nice tablecloths, nice overall look and ambiance of the restaurant. I felt a tad underdressed wearing jeans, a sweatshirt, and my Toms, walking into this restaurant.

Nonetheless, seating was pretty immediate. Their brunch menu is pretty good- lots of different omelettes and brunch options. I opted for the gyro. melt- provolone, onion, tomato, and cucumber sauce,  and I opted for it on pita.

First, I ordered the \"geee-ro\" melt. Let alone, I'm sure I don't even pronounce it right. The waitress was like, \"what? the Jyyy-ro melt?\" AAAHHHH. So wrong, so wrong! I thought maybe I heard it wrong. I asked her again.. and once again, she said \"Jyyy-ro\". AAAH!! At least say it right if you're serving it!

It came out.... a sloppy mess on pita bread. Well, I mean, it was at least wrapped in foil. The potatoes... or hash browns? weren't that great...rather greasy. It had two tomatoes with the cheese weirdly melted on the tomato...and then.... where was the actual meat? I found one to two very thin slices of meat. Bleh. The cucumber sauce wasn't even that great as well.

So, definitely not for brunch. Maybe the other meals are better?"}
{"text":"This is a good spot and a good choice for upscale bar food and casual dining.  The space itself is very nice with lots of exposed brick classic ceilings and a big bar.  However, I was surprised that the tv's were not plasmas.  I ate at the bar and the bartender was pretty good.  I was disappointed not to see a draught system and was served guiness in a bottle.  I ordered the french onion soup, which was super flavorful and served very hot, which is good.  I was a bit surprised that they were a little skimpy on the cheese.  This usually is not a problem with this soup.  I ordered a blue burger which was cooked perfectly.  I asked for medium and served with a nice helping of crumbled bleu cheese and mushrooms.  The burger was a very healthy 1/2 pound burger, I'd guess.  I ordered the sweet potato fries instead of regular.  Overall, a good option for casual dining and good food at reasonable prices."}
