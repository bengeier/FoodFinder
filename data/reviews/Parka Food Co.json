{"text":"Ok where do I begin.... the food is heavily over priced for the potions and the so called \"amazing\" (according to other reviews)truffle and mushroom Mac and cheese , was terrible. No flavour, super watery and just not good. As a vegan I've tried many of Toronto's restaurants and this one has totally missed the mark. If you are looking to try vegan food for the first time or are a new vegan I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Been eating their awesome vegan Mac and cheese for a long time now at the ROM Friday nights. Sooo goood. This is the favourite items from my friends and I. We always designate one ticket each to get their Mac and cheese.


The staff is always nice friendly and overall awesome. Now they have a store within walking distance from my place. Been waiting for a long time.

Congrats!"}

Restaurant hopping trying dishes everywhere that had graffiti art nearby this was one of my favorite spots!! Graffiti Alley literally across the street... made for great backdrop for many people exploring the area.

I wish I had four more friends with me so that we could have ordered the entire menu. This was one of the highlights from visiting Toronto. Ventured here with a couple of friends who GREATLY enjoyed the food and also enjoy meat and other food as well. We devoured everything and I can honestly say if we had not been restaurant hopping earlier would have tried more items.

*Mac-n-Cheese with Truffle and Mushroom was not chalky like some vegan mac and cheese can be. 

*Tomato soup which takes like vine ripened incredible tomatoes. Imagine drinking a dreamy red sauce... it's delicious! We tried dipping some of the cauliflower into it which was a hit! 

*Cauliflower was fantastic comes with a dipping sauce. If you are having any of the burgers you may want to grab some ketchup... this is an excellent substitute for carb heavy fries. There is also siracha for the daring hotttt fiends. Some mixtures of these variations were fun to play with. 

*Portobello mushroom burger heaven! Could have finished on my own with some cauliflower fritters if we had not stopped at a bunch of taco places in another neighborhood. The bun is fluffy and toasted perfectly their sauced and topping here are well done. 

The staff was excited that we wanted to try everything. They are clearly fans of the business you can tell by their enthusiasm. Will DEFINITELY be back again when I come to Toronto and highly recommend that you stop in even if you are not Vegan. This is a fantastic business.

{"text":"I've probably been here everyday for the past week, while the menu is small and simple - don't let that fool you. The quality of the food is awesome, my favourites are the eggplant burger, and the portobello burger, although I love all of their burgers to be honest. Unlike many vegan places which try to replicate meat, this place really works with vegetables to make something unique and tasty! A bit pricey-but the quality is great"}
{"text":"What a treasure find!!!  Had the portobello burger, truffle mushroom Mac and cauliflower fritter and they were absolutely delicious!!!  Will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"This place is top notch. The staff our super friendly and the space is very modern and clean. I had the eggplant burger which was awesome and fries which were good too! TI'll be back"}
{"text":"I had the truffle mushroom Mac and cheese and I gotta say it was one of the best if not the best vegan Mac and cheese I've ever tried. That being said whatever flavour the 'cheese' lacked, the truffles definitely made up for it. The small size is pretty small so I recommend the large. I also tried the chocolate dip donut and it tasted better than a normal donut! The only bad thing I have to say is that you should only go here if you're really in the mood for Mac and cheese or a burger since their menu is pretty limited. Other than that I loved it and the service was quick and friendly!!"}
{"text":"I was surprised by how much I loved this place. I'm lactose intolerant so I've never understood people's obsession with mac and cheese. I tried plant based mac and cheese once before at a festival and it was SO BAD I thought I would be turned off of the stuff forever. 

But wow, the mac and cheese at this place is amazing! I don't know if this is what real mac and cheese is like, but if it is, I've been missing out. I got the truffle mushroom one and it's on the pricey side (I think I paid $11ish + tax for the regular size) but it's really very good. The space is also nice, really clean and spacey and simple. I got a cup of tea this time but am hoping to try their sodas next time! 

Definitely recommend for fellow lactose intolerant people!! Your stomach will thank you."}
{"text":"Who would have thought that vegan burgers could taste so good! My partner and I enjoyed the potato and portobello burgers and they were both supremely delicious."}
{"text":"Fantastic new eatery in Toronto right in the heart of Queen West. We couldn't decide so we tried their Mac with sun-dried tomatoes and olives, the Mac with truffle mushrooms, the potato burger and the eggplant burger. I honestly couldn't decide on a favorite -- it was all delicious and the portions were generous. The space is really open and inviting as well, and the staff were super friendly. We also had their house made ginger and grapefruit sodas-- great complement to the food. I will definitely be back whenever I'm in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Although a limited menu, it is all vegan with some gf options. I had the tomato soup which was satisfying. Then I had a trio of the Mac and cheese, made with gf macaroni. It's not on the menu but you get the first three favours in smaller portions for $15. It was the truffle mushroom, caramelized onion and sun dried tomato/olive flavours. They were all fine but I did not love any one in particular. It's nice that the ingredients are all fresh and they offer water for free"}
{"text":"Omg.. truffle Mac and cheese!! Staff are very friendly and helpful. So great to have a vegan spot again on Queen West"}
{"text":"Really great, quick service. I had the truffle mac and cheese which was so tasty. It's always a great day when your mac and cheese noodles aren't mushy. :)"}
{"text":"Great new little spot near Queen and Spadina!  I don't normally give out 5 stars, but felt this spot was worth it.  The eggplant burger is my favourite and the mac (all variations) are really tasty.  Food is very fresh and well prepared.  Interior is very well-designed, feels like you're eating in an art gallery.  Oh and try the ginger soda - it was really refreshing and definitely a unique taste that I haven't experienced before.  Staff was super cool and nice!"}
{"text":"Amazing! We had the potato burger and onion rings (to die for) and coleslaw. 
It's true comfort food that's vegan and everything is made in house. Super friendly service too. 
We will be back very soon to try the mac and cheese and soups and the other burgers!"}
{"text":"I came to try their vegan truffle mushroom Mac and cheese. It was $10.90 + tax for the box. They serve you fast casual style; you order at the counter and they will call your name once it is ready. 

The cheese sauce is not as viscous and sticky as normal cheese, but the colour and taste is as close at it gets to the real thing! The mushrooms were a good topping. 

I think they are a great option for vegans or lactose intolerant individuals who want comfort food. Maybe instead of McDonald's, come here next time!"}
