{"text":"Grabbed a sun-dried tomato salad here after a bike ride. The flavor was good, but the salad was unmixed. That might be my fault b/c I asked for dressing on the side but I doubt it. The bigger issue was that I found four walnut shells in the salad. Two I them surfaced while chewing, which kind of pissed me off. I told the kids who work that there were issues and they promise to look into it.

Meyer lemon iced tea is very good. Nice touch.

Service was quick."}
{"text":"Service is great, good for a comfort food fix. Love the mac and cheese with grilled chicken."}
{"text":"Love the food. Great service. Clean and efficient food preparation. Great value for money."}
{"text":"I love this place. Food is amazing, afordable and service is awesome. Love you guys!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm giving this place 4 stars.  For some reason, I was convinced that this place was going to be terra-buh (as Charles Barkley likes to say).  My youngest daughter had been here once, loved it and wanted to go back.  She had received a free kids meal through her school and so I reluctantly went here, thinking that I'd survive the meal and then step into the delicious world of Elizabeth Creamery next door for a little ice cream.

Well, I have to say that the margherita noodles were really good.  Big portions like everyone else on Yelp has said.  I added three veggies for $1 and they seemed fairly fresh - broccoli, squash, carrots.  My wife got the chicken pad thai noodles and true to form, the Yelpers who said it's pretty good, were right.  The kids had buttery pasta - their drinks were free, which was a nice surprise.  Noodles were a bit too buttery - when I tried to pick one up, it moved all around like a slippery eel, and it ended up jettisoning across the restaurant.  

Staff was extremely friendly.  They even had a few interesting beers next to the usual Lite this and Lite that.  And they were under $4 (thank you).

Wouldn't come here on a regular basis but it definitely beats taking the kids to fast food joints like McRib's and it's a nice change of pace from pizza places.

Big shout out to Yelper reviews.  Once again, they steered us right and the items we ordered all turned out to be very good.  xxxoooxxxooo fellow Yelpers!"}
{"text":"I ordered take out.  My order was prepared and put on the rack.   They were busy and I was forgotten about.  Finally I asked and they gave me my food.  I ordered the pesto pasta.  The flavor was OK but there was so much cheese mixed in the pasta that I dared not eat much of it lest I pay for it later.  My daughter got the grilled cheese which had 2 thick slices of cheese, way too much in my opinion.  So neither of us ate much of our meal.  Maybe they should change their name to Nothing but Cheese."}
{"text":"Love this place. The Padthai noodles are delicious. The prices are good for your wallet also."}
{"text":"One of my favorites!! I love the Asian Thai peanut noodles. Its es spicy!!!! My husband got the beef stroganoff and it was great!!! The atmosphere is casual. Sweet tea is so good."}
{"text":"Great food and service.  The portions are large and the food is very fresh.  Took a couple months for new management to get the place running well and get their liquor license, but the place rocks now. Very good value and better service than the Rea Rd location."}
{"text":"Great food, fast and cheap. One of my favorite stops for a quick meal- they've got a great variety of pasta dishes and tons of ways to customize them (with different meats, veggies, etc). Also the servings are nice and big, so I always grab a box for the leftovers and heat it up the next day. Really can't beat the value!"}
{"text":"I love pasta and I love NBN! This place is wonderful and has such a variety. I want to try everything. My favorite and go to is the Spicy Cajun Pasta with Mushrooms and Zucchini/Squash. YUM! They are always so quick to get my order out. Today I was given the wrong order and before I even got to my car, the sweet girl behind the counter had chased me out to my car to tell me and allowed me to pull my car around to the back and delivered it right out to my car so I didnt have to go back in. Talk about customer service! How sweet! Their bread sticks are delish as well!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  My mom and I eat here at least once every time I'm home from college.  I'm a super picky eater, so the fact that they have \"buttery noodles\" on the adult menu is a HUGE plus.  I have to order off the kid's menu way too often.  I'm also 21. Their prices are very reasonable and the service is super quick! Check this place out!"}
{"text":"The food was good and good portions for the price.  But most importantly, the customer service was excellent! !"}
{"text":"This place makes an awesome simple salad. Asian salad has cilantro, carrots, crunchy noodles and an awesome sweet chili sauce. Full size salad is a big amount, half will probably suffice next time. I'll be making this a destination once a week for lunch in between classes! Be sure to use your student discount :-)"}
{"text":"Noodles, noodles, everywhere, and not a drop to...eat?

Surprisingly cheap and tasty, you won't be disappointed if you're seriously about your noodle noshing. 

I came for a Father Daughter Lunchdate, and we were on the lookout for some pho with a little ambiance (ie not an establishment where you put your face in your noodles, slurp them up onto your shirt and then dash).  We pulled up and I had reservations. Will this be a noodle place for sad people who think chicken balls are legit Chinese food? I want some intestines in my noodles, so that would be tres uncool.

ATMOSPHERE:
A wee bit like a cafeteria. Warehouse-high ceilings and big windows, plastic seats and tables. You ain't coming here for the ambiance my friends - you come for a hot lunch that will fill you up with empty delicious carbs, that's what. Definitely simple and kid-friendly, you could bring a pack of them with you and pull a few tables together. Not good for a date, nope.


FOOD:

Right on your right as you enter the door is the menu in quadruple size on the wall. Say what? Italian, Thai, or Chinese noodles? All under the same roof? Yes. I know what you're thinking. In a pan-whatever cuisine restaurant, something's got to give. 

Well, my Thai curry soup was surprisingly delicious. Not too salty, goopy or creamy (usually bad food quality and health signs). My pear, walnut and blue cheese salad was also surprisingly good - fresh pear slices, natural walnuts, and decent cheese on crunchy spinach. Dressing not too goopy or slathered on, either. My inner fitness nerd didn't cry her eyes out over this meal, despite the sodium. Mmm, delicious delicious sodium.

My father went with shanghai noodles with beef and they were also fresh-tasting and not too oily (anyone who eats Chinese on the cheap, you know what I'm talking about).

SERVICE:
It is a serve yourself joint. Place the order, grab a number, your forks, chopsticks, napkins, whatever else you need, and find a table. The server brings it out to you. The people looked tired but they were pleasant. The food wasn't exceptionally fast, but they made it to order, so no complaints.

LOCATION:
Right near Mount Joy GO station. For those of you in Toronto, that would be Near The Edge Of The Known Universe (watch out, you'll fall off!). For us GTAers, that means East Markham, in the developing area near York-Durham line. The plaza is easy to find, north of 16th and Bur Oak on Highway 48. 

OVERALL:
Come to this place for a quick and dirty noodle nosh on your lunchhour or for a casual weekend snack. Our tab clocked in at $16 bucks for both of us and we left well-fed."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of NBN!  It's one of my favorite spots for take-out now that Elizabeth Avenue is finally open and free from construction.  I usually stick to the Asian menu items and I am always pleased.  The food is fast and fresh (so making substitutions and/or additions to your dish is easy) and the grilled chicken is delicious!  Make sure you order a chocolate chip cookie to round off your meal...they warm them in the oven for you.  YUM!"}
{"text":"Tasty noodles with good portions. They don't skimp on the butter, cream, or oil. It really depends on the dish you order. We had the chicken pomodoro pasta and southwest chipotle pasta. Both were flavourful but the southwest was a bit oily. 
Most of the pastas come with a bread stick."}
{"text":"The whole experience was awful. Especially the part where I watched one of the cooks walk out of the bathroom without washing his hands and then proceed to handle and cook food items. Was it yours? I hope not...."}
{"text":"Great food at reasonable prices.  
Had dinner last night - kids had pasta & breadsticks, and I had pasta primavera.  Great flavor, veggies were fresh & still had a little crunch to them- not over cooked at all! My kids loved the pasta & breadsticks.  Restaurant was busy -it was 7:30pm Monday- but there was plenty of seating.  Noise level was loud, but expected in a casual, order & sit family friendly place.  Tables were cleaned immediately by staff, and the soda fountain area was also well stocked & clean.  
Desserts were really really good (cannoli & chocolate chip cookies), but I thought a little expensive (abt $5/cannoli).
Overall, a great place to eat!  Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"This place has never disappointed. Good amount of food for a great price. Spicy Japanese Noodle is great as well as the rest of the menu. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Went yesterday and was pleased.  Ordered the Thai Peanut noodles.  Lots of deliciously fresh veggies and the meat tasted great.  Plus, they were filling a huge catering order so the meal took a bit to get to me, so the manager brought me free breadsticks.  Most places don't even know you're there once you order and she sought me out, apologized, and brought me free sticks!  Great service!!!"}
{"text":"ordered the basil pesto and pad thai, not impressed. I won't be able eating here again... stinks out of both ends"}
{"text":"Pretty standard noodles place.  The food was good and the place was clean.  Nothing bad, but nothing I would write home about, either.  I would definitely come back because you get a lot of food for not a lot of money.  My $10 noodles was enough for two nights' dinners.  

All in all, pretty solid but not spectacular."}
{"text":"Its sad, because the food is really excellent when they want it to be.  And the people behind the register try to get the service right.  On March 4th we went to Nothing but Noodles for lunch after church.  This is where my children wanted to go eat, they love the place.  We ordered our food and sat down and started to eat.  Service was quick for a Sunday, we had beaten the rush.  About half way through my sons meal he started to gag and cough, seems he found hair in his food.  When I brought his meal to the register we were offered another bowl, which my son declined, instead we asked for a few breadsticks.  Well, they were out of breadsticks so they offered cheesy garlic bread, which we declined.  The cashier took the meal back to the office, explained our problem, and then never came back.  We stood there for a few minutes, while the staff behind the counter cooked and joked around, and after feeling foolish we went back to our seats and then packed up and left.
I would have expected to be offered something else, coupon for a replacement meal, money back on the meal we had, anything other than a sorry and then the back of the employee.  
We will not be going back to Nothing but Noodles, which is a shame, since my children like to eat there.  The lack of service in this type of situation is just awful."}
{"text":"I have tried to give this place a chance but they have failed every time.  The food is over priced and the taste is bland, greasy or just too much cheese.  The chicken parm is horrible and the cheese will choke you if you are not careful.  The Alfredo noodles are greasy and the shrimp scampi is bland and tasteless.  I paid $28 for scampi and was very disappointed.  The sauce they gave me was so hot it ruined my wife's food and I ate it bland.  What a waste of money and time.  Don't waste your time and money on this place."}
{"text":"Usually one to avoid the chain restaurant or any place that screams concept, I was pleasantly surprised by the wonderful experience I had this evening at Nothing But Noodles on Elizabeth Avenue near CPCC. 

After a very long week of work which ended in a very long Friday, my husband and I wanted a quick and painless dinner so after seeing a coupon in one of the weekly mailers (the mailers that usually sit on the counter until the coupons are expired) we decided to run out for a \"buy one get one free\" bowl of noodles.

We both ordered the rice noodles with peanut sauce and split some pot stickers.  The service was fantastic.  The cashier was very nice without being saccharine even offering to explain the menu and ordering process.  The restaurant was impeccably clean with a sanitation score of 101.5 and not a spot of dirt anywhere.  Even the back of house (although there is really no back of the house as the kitchen is fully visible) was shiny and orderly.  Someone on staff was cleaning the entire time we were there. 

After we grabbed our drinks and sat down a server/bus person brought out our pot stickers.  We ate a couple and then started on the noodles.   The noodle portion was enormous with a flavorful homemade sauce and fresh vegetables.  A must have is the Key Lime pie.  It has a great crust and although the flavor is obviously key lime the creamy pie does not leave you with a perpetual pucker.

We noticed that they also offer homemade cotton candy for the kids which along with the other very kid friendly menu options, non-smoking atmosphere, unobtrusive music and pleasant lack of TVs' makes this a very family friendly restaurant.

All of that aside it was the customer service and attention to detail that made our experience truly remarkable.  The owner of the establishment was present and working at closing on a Friday night.  He takes pride in his restaurant and has obviously passed that on to his employees.  It is really refreshing to know that a business owner cares. 

Thank you Todd and the rest of the staff at Nothing but Noodles for an unexpected pleasure.  You really turned what was supposed to be a quick bit to eat into a great evening out."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Sad that it had to close down. Everything that's been there has closed so I didn't think it would survive because it is in a bad spot but I hope that Showmar's will succeed."}
{"text":"the japanese spicy noodle is not spicy at all, and the teast is teeeerrrrible!ii

the noodle is very thick, seems did not cook through.

the price is high.  $3 extra if you want to add meat."}
{"text":"I don't know where all these negative reviews are from...I had the Pad Thai today and it was AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend this restaurant, very tasty noodles, prices are reasonable, and the environment is casual and comfortable.

We went in for Kids Night and they had Elmo and Minnie Mouse entertaining the kids!  It was only for that night for their Grand Opening week activities."}
{"text":"Pad Thai was excellent and my coworkers loved their alfredo as well."}
{"text":"I had the pad Thai noodles with chicken and it was awesome. I also appreciated the kids menu. Surprisingly good quality and quantity for the price."}
{"text":"I ordered the beef stroganoff which was pretty darn good but the sauce was watery which I would like it to be a little thicker."}
{"text":"The perfect place if you have several in your party who want a different type of noodles, salads, etc. The Shrimp Scampi is very tasty. The garlic comes through, and they put a slice of lemon on the side if you'd like to squeeze on more yourself. They don't skimp on the shrimp. The Spicy Cucumber Salad is my favorite. I add shrimp. Very fresh and tasty. Indoor and outdoor seating. Fountain drinks and tea are \"serve yourself\". Order, pay, and then take your number to your table to be served."}
{"text":"I've only been here once, and it was good. I had the noodles that was basically Pad Thai with added chicken. Yum!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here once at Nothing But Noodles before, pretty satisfied. Huge portions, decent Marinara, and leftovers for lunch the next day.

That was visit #1. Come visit #2.

I ordered:

    Fettuccine Alfredo w/ Roasted Vegetables. (Note the pic above is the basil pesto dish, but the grease/cheese ratio was pretty similar)

Problem: There was an exORBITANT amount of Parmasean, combined with the watery-collating nature of their supposedly \"freshly made cream sauce\". After a few swirls, the unevenly cut roasted veg started forming big, hardened chunks. I tried my best to separate and salvage the veg and pasta I could, but it really became a big, salty, creamy mess. Like untangling hair from a dirty pipe. Absolutely disgusting. I might as well have handed over my ten bucks.

Two hours later, I felt my stomach churn. I felt used and abused. Never again.

{"text":"So, I haven't written many reviews on here, mainly because, well, I can be lazy. There, I said it. But after reading through some other reviews I thought I should share mine. 

Let me start by saying this is one of my son's stand-by favs. And my hubby & I think it's not too shabby either. Quick, convenient, & tasty. While service has been sometimes spotty in the past, I noticed on our visit tonight that the staff went out of their way and were very courteous & accommodating. There are signs stating that they have new management & it seems to show (which is why I upped my star count to 4). Little man's regular dish is basil pesto pasta w/shrimp and mine/hubby's is the spicy Japanese noodles. I read reviews that the pad Thai is not spicy, but if you're looking for a kick, these noodles are the way to go!

All in all, if you're looking for a quick bite in the area and want to avoid \"fast food,\" then it's definitely worth a visit.

One last note for my thrifty friends, there are often coupons in the LKW magazine if you receive that in the mail. :)"}
{"text":"Went to grab a bite here with my fiancé a few months back. The wait wasn't long, food was delicious and the customer service was excellent."}
{"text":"We called in an order on Monday evening! We're used to eating over at the Elizabeth location. Having it back closer to home is amazing. Food is awesome. The service is quick. And the new decor is very nice. We will Def be back. Love Nothing but noodles!"}
{"text":"I really do like this place! I loove the pad thai! it's really filling and yummy! I don't care for the key lime pie, it's too sour for me. 

I also love the pear and  baby spinach salad, that's always amazing! I've been going there for a couple of years now and is one of my favorite resturants."}
{"text":"On another trip to Charlotte, my brother and I walked into Nothing but Noodles, after reading reviews, on Christmas Eve.It was moderately busy, yet we got a nice warm welcome from the staff.  It was our first time here so we needed a few minutes to take in the menu and make some choices.
    I decided on the Garden Fresh Salad, the half size, with the Roasted Garlic Balsamic, minus a few ingredients.  They had an \"add-on\" list posted at the register, which prompted me to quickly add 3 for $.99. I also had the option of adding those items to my salad, on the side, and either steamed,raw, or wok-tossed.  I chose Broccoli, Mushrooms and Carrots, wok-tossed, on the side.
  My brother went with the Spicy Japanese Noodles, add Beef.  At that time another staff member walked up and offered my brother a house salad, free of charge, as he had \"made an extra,\" my brother happily accepted.  We added two waters and our total came to $15.14.  We took our cups, and our number card.   It was self service as far as beverages, straws, napkins, etc.  We got our drinks, chose our table and the food followed shortly, within 3 minutes.  I was surprised when i saw my salad.  I ordered the half, yet this was not a tiny salad.  I cant imagine have gotten the regular order, then again, I wasn't starving.  I also got my veggies on the side.  My brother received a decent bowl of noodles, which smelled great.  
   My salad was crisp, fresh, and I loved the dressing.  My side of veggies were done well.  They were lightly cooked which softened them, yet still retained that crunch.  My brother was equally as pleased.  I am not a spice, or meat fan, but I did taste his noodles. They were on the mild side of spice, which I liked, and had a great flavor!  
    Overall, great experience at Nothing but Noodles, and will definitely return!  The staff were great and more attentive than expected at this style of restaurant."}
{"text":"Seriously don't even waste your time. I have never gotten home with a full order that is correct, whether that be the actual amount of food or the flavor...I learned to check and make sure that the meat IS ACTUALLY IN THE DISH now before I leave and 90% of the time it is not. Not sure why it's so hard to get an order right when it's printed right in front of you.

The reason I stopped going is the people that work there. When I open my bag before I leave to check it, I get a snotty teenager attitude. It's not like I'm asking them to go over each item with me, I know what I ordered, but I AM making sure it's right before I leave because there's no way I'm driving back. The kids they have working there are rude and I'm just over dealing with them."}
{"text":"We decided to grab lunch here the other day and were pretty happy we did!  They have different themed noodle dishes - American inspires/Asian inspired & one other category I believe.  My husband got the mac & cheese and it was really good.  I ordered the Japanese spicy noodles.  I really enjoyed my dish as well - it was perfectly spicy - not too much.  There was a vegetable medley mixed in with it as well.  Overall, we really liked our lunch and will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I was craving good pad Thai and have yet to find many places in the city that can do it right. Decided to try nothing but noodles because at least my kids would find something they liked there, unlike most Thai places. 

I was pleasantly surprised with the pad Thai! Good sauce, perfect noodles, veggies were crisp and delicious, eggs good, peanuts good! My only complaint was that the chicken was severely overcooked. Next time  I'll try a different protein."}
{"text":"We've driven by this location several times and I was excited to try it.  Turns out, I was confusing it with Noodles and Co.  I realized my mistake once I saw the menu, but since we were there we gave it a try.  I wish we had passed. 

Based on the appearance of the menu, I am shocked this is a chain.  The menu signs are poorly designed and look cheap.   The entire set up just isn't that professional looking. Nothing about the place screams fresh food.  

I ordered a Sesame Lo Mein.  It was ok.  Not horrible, but not good either. Kids both had Mac n cheese.  They liked it well enough, but I thought I was flavorless.  

The bizarre thing was my hubs'  meal. He ordered a shrimp pesto dish. He should have read the description more carefully.  It arrived as a big bowl of shrimp and pesto looking liquid -  lack of a better description.  This bowl was nestled in a big bowl of raw spinach.  In all my years of eating out, I just couldn't figure it out.  The pesto concoction wasnt soup and there was no dressing for the spinach, so it wasn't a salad - what in the world do you do with this meal?  We went and read the menu description thinking they must have forgot the pasta, but no, they didn't.  This item is listed as a specialty of theirs.  Just.plain.weird.  He ended up buying a bowl of noodles to mix the sauce into and it actually tasted ok, but what a pain!  We ended up taking the raw spinach home in two take out boxes - there was that much spinach!  Four hours to think about it and i still cant figure out what that meal was supposed to be.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"Great Value ,great food, Quick Service, friendly people. Owner came out to ask if we were enjoying our meal.  will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I had spicy Thai noodles - tasty, good-sized lunch portion, and not fried fast food. This location has ample free parking across the street."}
{"text":"I go to school at cpcc and this is such an awesome place for lunch. It's really spacious and clean inside so you won't ever feel crowded or feel rushed to eat your food so someone else can have your table. 

Stuffed shells and fettuccine Alfredo was pleasantly really good. Service was also great and if you're a student they'll give you a student discount! 

Skip out on the Lobster Ravioli, it's claimed to be spicy but it's just an overall weird overdosage of Cajun seasoning taste."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Went during the week not busy at all. And foods good. Especially the breadsticks :)"}
{"text":"Pros: Large portions, and good service - very friendly, sweet girl behind the register

Con: The food just isn't very good. The only flavor the Pad Thai has is salty."}
{"text":"This is the last time we'll come to this location. Too many incorrect orders, over charges and lack of good customer service. Just can't see any reason why we would want to come back."}
{"text":"I arrived at Nothing but Noodles yesterday about two minutes after they had closed.  

Some friends had already ordered and were seated at the patio having their meal.  Since I could not order, I went next door and picked up some food

When I brought my food to the patio area, the \"manager\" blocked me from entering and told me to get out.  I tried to explain that my friends were still eating and I would have happily ordered a meal from them as well if they hadn't been closed.  

He proceeded to argue with me and told me that I could not sit with my party and had to get out of the area because he just wanted to get home.  

Thank goodness for the excellent customer service at Earl's next door.  My friends and I moved next door and we were able to eat in peace.  

Sadly, I doubt I will ever come back to this establishment."}
{"text":"My little cousins rave about Nothing But Noodles, and beg to eat there most days after school. I was surprised how good my meal was from this VERY kid friendly place. I had alfredo and added 3 veggies (only $.99), can't pass that up! My little guest had the infamous Butter Noodles...I think thats what all the kids get. lol Nice place for a quick meal, can't wait to get back!"}
{"text":"Not sure why everyone loves this place. Being the carb-junkie that I am, I was so excited to try this place out. I got the shrimp scampi and my SO got the Thai peanut noodle. My shrimp dish was so oily and flavorless-- his was too ketchup/vingar tasting. I don't know. Maybe we just went on an off day, but definitely won't be coming back here again."}
{"text":"I had been to Nothing But Noodles once before, and really enjoyed the Pad Thai. I went back today after church with my husband. He ordered Fetticine Alfredo and said it was very good. There was a slight problem, and when called to their attention, the girl at the counter apologized, redid the order and refunded our money. My husband really enjoyed his pasta, and wasn't deterred by the mistake. He will go back. I got a Spinach salad with added chicken. It was fresh, and the spiced almonds and Craisins were just the right combination along with the creamy poppy seed dressing. The iced tea was very good as well. A good dining experience!"}
{"text":"so i had a bday giftcard but it was for another noodle place she signed me up and gave me a free dessert anyway (which was the peanut butter pie GREAT) when i sat down to dine in i made my drink and went to table (i was in front) but soon as i grabed  it it wasted everywhere the lady from back came over in .2 seconds and cleaned it up. gave me a cup and silverware but wet sign out and everything she was on it"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a great place for the family. My two boys (4 & 6 yrs.) both love it. They usually get the Mac&Cheese with broccoli added. Great way for them to get their veggies. I love their Greek Salad. I ask for wheat noodles & usually add a protien like shrimp or tofu. Love the friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"I don't know how I never been to one of this noodle only places but I'm happy I finally got to experience it at Nothing But Noodles. I bought a few Groupons for this place since any carb is a friend in my book and was excited to see what it was all about. I love the variety and how you can get Asian, Italian, American style dishes and add protein for only $2 and some change. I went with the Chicken Pad Thai since I'm an Italian girl and wanted a break from anything involving oregano and garlic. It was tasty (but not authentic pad thai like you would get at a thai joint) and a HUGE portion. I had a bowl for dinner then had leftovers today so even though it comes to about $9 a meal, it really can be two meals. They were quick with my order and it was only a 5 minute wait for carry out. And they have the big, clear to go cups (think Starbucks), I don't know why but those make me happy and any place that has those gets brownie points from me. All in all, a great place to check out if you're hungry and want something satiating."}
{"text":"Was excited to see Nothing But Noodles come back to our area, never got the chance to try them, but we finally did this month and it was fantastic!

I ordered the stuffed shells with broccoli and hubs ordered the pad thai.  You would think 3 shells would not be much, but they were stuffed big!  Great flavor, sauce was fantastic, especially with the broccoli and who can complain of more melted cheese on top!  Yum!  Hubs really loved his as well.  Both made for great leftovers.  Oh and the breadsticks were good too!

No issue with service, other than maybe checking in with us a little too much.

Only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because I save those for the best and my favorites!  Plus they don't have my favorite pasta dish - lasagna!  

We will take advantage of this place being close!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! Super great food and service. Casey and Allen were very attentive, friendly, and made sure I had a flawless experience. It's refreshing to see employees that care so much about their work and customers! I will be returning!!"}
{"text":"At first this place threw me off and i was quite confused but this place is a well hidden secret. Its good food fast at a great price. I usually order the lobster ravioli or the shrimp scampi with broccoli added and any kind of salad that catches my eye that night. It a great place for singles like myself to go to when you want the feel of a nice dinner out with out going a lone, I go here at least twice a month,"}
{"text":"Recently I attended the Nothing But Noodles at Stonecrest. I had an overall great experience including fast service and a tasty meal. One worker I interacted with was particularly social and interactive. Lauren at Stonecrest was a great server! Highly recommend this establishment!"}
{"text":"The food is okay, but evidently the management cares nothing about the comfort of their patrons. In summer, it is blazing hot inside. In winter, better bring a blanket. When all your customers are eating with their heavy winter coats on, maybe you can get a clue? Not a transient problem, it's been this way since the place opened. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Decent, but not my favorite! 

Pad Thai w no egg- pretty good, I'd order it again!

Fettuccini Alfredo- not a really good one. I ended up taking it back for the pad Thai"}
{"text":"The portion size and bread sticks was good. But they over slatted their food, and the open kitchen makes the restaurant very loud!"}
{"text":"Like the restaurant says, it's a primarily based noodle shop covering asian, american, and italian.  I didn't expect too much since it looks like a typical fast food restaurant that you see at a shopping mall.  Well, needless to say it really wasn't much. 

I ordered a Pad Thai when I first went there.  And it was tasteless.  Gave it a second try and ordered one of their recommended dishes.  It was better tasting than the Pad Thai, but not by much.  I pretty much bought a $11 dollar stomach ache. 

I'd rather heat up some cheap ramen in a microwave."}
{"text":"Slow business night apparently  and 8 employees just waiting for customers while standing around.   Salad with pear slices that you need to chop into eatable pieces in the spinach salad with whole chunks of walnuts and huge blue cheese chunks.  Dumpling appetizer was hot and crisp.   I think this is the same place that closed years back from across the street, maybe not.... nothing special and a bit over priced.  Fun tip, they have local made frozen Popsicles for sale."}
{"text":"Despite all the crazy construction on Elizabeth Ave that never seems to end, we ventured out to Nothing But Noodles for dinner.  We had tried the chain's other location in Stonecrest and enjoyed it much more than its competitor, Noodles & Company, so we thought we'd give this closer location a try.  Needless to say, it was definitely satisfying.  

I tend to steer more toward the Asian dishes because they're not something I normally make at home.  This time, I tried the Spicy Japanese Noodles.  The sauce was divine.   It had so much flavor and complemented the extremely thick noodles nicely.   And the portion size was \"just enough\" to fill me up without making me too full.   My partner tried the Southwest Chipotle Pasta.  It was very creamy and full of flavor, too.  He said it was missing something, though, so when I gave him the mushrooms from my dish that I didn't want, he discovered that's what it was missing, so it all worked out.  

The restaurant also had a great atmosphere.  It was very spacious, modern, and clean.  The service was fantastic, both at the register and at the table when the dishes were served and cleaned off.  This isn't a full-service restaurant, but they do bring your dishes out to you steaming hot (yum!) after you order at the counter.  

We're definitely going back..."}
{"text":"I usually get the basil pesto with chicken. For some reason the pasta is not cooked as always. 
One day had a lot of oil, I ended sick.
Last week I ordered the Alfredo with chicken. There were only noodles without flavor! Never ordering again. The stick bread is addictive. The place is really LOUD. Friendly staff, Restrooms and tables are not always clean. It's a meh..."}
{"text":"With all types of noodle restaurants popping up around the area, we decided to get our noodle cherry popped this past weekend.  We were in the area and gave Nothing But Noodles a try.  Visiting Target and/or the movie theater at Stonecrest, I always saw the sign for Nothing But Noodles, but never had the opportunity or an inkling to stop by.  Now I can gladly say that I've been and can add NBN to my short list of places to grab a quick bite at Stonecrest.  (My other options were Wendy's, Chick Fil-A, or Qdoba, so NBN is a welcome addition.)  

The best thing about NBN is that they have a variety of options to suit the taste of any family member and nobody has to bicker about what to order and/or make at home.  The kids all had spaghetti, my partner had angel hair pasta with veggies in a wine sauce, and I tried the Thai Peanut noodles.  All looked and tasted delicious.  It was a good, quick, hot meal and everyone agreed that the restaurant was a good choice for the future as well because nobody could ever be disappointed.  

I was pleasantly surprised to find that NBN also carried appetizers (including lettuce wraps -- one of my favorites!) and salads for those wanting to add a little something more to their dinner or go a little lighter than pasta.   It was a welcome addition for a \"fast food\" restaurant.  I'm looking forward to returning and trying different items all over the menu.

And maybe next time we'll pick up a big bag of cotton candy for the road for only $1!  Fun!"}
{"text":"Sitting in here right now. Had my food messed up four times. Went to the person I had dealt with everytime who had been treating me well and asked for a refund on my meal because I was growing frustrated with the wait and I wanted to go across the street and get something to eat at chick fil a. All of a sudden a manager who was in a dress not in uniform with no name tag or indication that she was an employee started to tell me about how the meal I ordered came with something. I had to argue and tell her 3 times I had asked for it without it and the meal I ordered didn't state on the menu what they put in it. Regardless of whether it was or not you don't argue with your customer who's pissed off about not being able to eat while his table feasts. Horrible and despicable service from a manager. I am 19 years old and can properly handle angry customers what a shame to see a great company with such rude and childish management. Also to the female employee who dropped the silverware on the table in disgust have fun working a low paying job for the rest of your life"}
{"text":"Spicy Cajun pasta is a must and bread sticks are almost on par with Olive Garden. Also saw Hornets star Cody Zeller here who makes Millions of dollars so its gotta be good if a millionaire goes here before a game"}
{"text":"This place has been hit or miss for me the few times I've been. The Caesar salad and pad Thai were both pretty good, but I wouldn't recommend any of the soups"}
{"text":"I was familiar with another Noodles establishment but I decided to give Nothing but Noodles a try. Although this place is a little more pricier, the menu is far more extensive, food tastes better and staff is very friendly. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I think my husband and I have decided that this \"fast\" food type restaurant is our favorite. Go up to the counter and take your number style like Jason's Deli. The food takes probably around 10 minutes and is delicious. I got the basil pesto pasta. It's bow tie pasta with a basil cream sauce, tomatoes, and mushrooms. It is very good and heats up well. It also comes with a bread stick fresh out of the oven. My husband got a salad and added steak, and we shared the tomato bisque and some more bread sticks. Our bill was around $20. 

They have outdoor seating and on Saturdays you can hear the band playing next door on the Flying Biscuit patio."}
{"text":"Slowly discovering my new stomping grounds.  First time here.   I sense i will be here several times a week.  I love my salad and my service.  My only complaint.  I am addicted to thus balsamic pear spina h salad with warm grilled chicken."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Nothing But Noodles and it will probably be my last. The problem was, I entered the establishment craving Pho. Now I was smart enough to know I wasn't going to actually be able to order Pho but I certainly thought what I did order was going to taste better than it actually did.

My husband and I both ordered the Spicy Japanese noodles with shrimp. Per the menu, the dish came with spicy noodles and an abundance of broccoli (take a look at my picture that I posted. Do you see an abundance of broccoli?) The noodles were like no other noodle I have ever seen. It was spaghetti on steroids. It was the Arnold Schwarzenegger of Spaghetti and they were gummy. Gag! The shrimp were very tiny and the sauce was so spicy, you couldn't taste anything else. Don't get me wrong I love spicy food but when the spice is all you can taste, it ruins the entire dish.

The place was crazy busy and loud and the table we sat at was sticky. I don't even want to know what went on at that table before we sat down. Images of toddlers smearing half chewed pasta into the table with the ball of their hands kept flashing before my eyes.

The only positive, the food came out quick."}
{"text":"As always, excellent food and excellent service! Love this place!! There's something for everyone. The food is cooked to your specifications too. I always take home half of my order, so it's like two meals for the price of one! Major deals!!"}
{"text":"This is a regular place for my husband and I. Their food is amazing and fresh every time. The staff is always pleasant and go out of their way to ensure the customers are enjoying their food. Today I ordered a bit more than usual and with a toddler I had my hands full. One of the employees came to my rescue and carried my order out to the car for me. What else can a person ask for? Great food, awesome service and amazing employees!"}
{"text":"New location. Great atmosphere, food and music.   A big shout out to Syed who gave us great service!"}
{"text":"Okay, so for the most part the food seems edible, however I wouldn't recommend getting the Asian dishes. You don't go to Mexican food place and get a burger, don't go here and get Pad Thai. First of all it was served with a lemon instead of a lime and the eggs were all in one big clump. It was as if I ordered scrambled egg with noodles. I wasn't impressed.  I might go back and try something else . . . if I didn't have any other options."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at Nothing but Noodles.  Previously, I had heard great thins about their food (especially their breadsticks) so I figured I'd finally give it a try.

While the restaurant was clean and their staff were friendly, my meal was just did not blow me away.  I ordered sesame lo mein with a side of breadsticks.  I can appreciate that my lo mein was healthy, but it certainly lacked flavor.  The breadsticks were the best part of my meal.

Overall, I wasn't impressed with my dinner at Nothing but Noodles, though I'm open to trying other things on their menu."}
{"text":"It's a strange concept - this place serves a variety of different noodle dishes from different ethnic cuisines. They have Italian food, Japanese noodles and Thai noodles.

I loved my pad thai and it's great that they bring the food out to your table when it's ready. But the potstickers are what gave this place its fourth star - they're possibly the best I've ever had. Stop by and try them!"}
{"text":"The restaurant I originally wanted to go to was closed so we decided to eat at nothing but noodles. I'm really glad we chose to eat here. It worked out well that the restaurant  is fast casual so we were in and out fairly quickly. I had the spicy Japanese noodles with shrimp. It came out nice and hot and cooked well. It had a nice kick but was not too spicy . The veggies were not mushy and the shrimp were delicious. I love udon noodles and that was the big reason I ordered this dish. It's served with lime which adds a good acidic twist. I wish they had a location where I live in Winston Salem."}
{"text":"I stopped here instead of the long line at Chic fila for take away. Sooo happy I did ! The Thai noodles with peanut sauce is delicious. I asked for extra sauce and the manager Danielle was quick to oblige. All of the staff were pleasant and helpful. Working their tushes off with a smile isn't always easy but they pulled it off and made my day. Will be returning to try other things on the menu. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, staff and location. The staff came out to sing happy birthday for my daughter. Amazing experience!!!!"}
{"text":"I really did not enjoy my experience here. I had the Three-Cheese Macaroni and it was soupy, watery and basically flavorless. We went in for a late lunch, and I don't know if they hadn't had a chance to clean up from the lunch rush or what, but it seemed quite dirty. 

Not impressed, can't imagine I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Nice for lunch. Serving size is a nice size portion. I dined outside on the patio and they still came out to check on me. I order the pad Thai and added shrimp it was missing a few key ingredients but was suffice for the moment. They have a gluten free menu and it's budget friendly."}
{"text":"I love how you can pick what kind of noodles, veggies, and meat you want. Basically, you create your own concoction of Italian food. 

Yummy yummy pasta indeed! However, although there is a lot of space, the décor is okay, and this place cannot come to par with some Italian restaurants. It's price is okay for a more casual establishment that it is. 

When it is packed, the wait times can be quite long and the staff doesn't try to be that friendly. But still, for great pastas and a variety of selection, I give it a four star."}
{"text":"I've eaten here three times now. The first time was great, second time was ok, third time... should have been \"the charm,\" but was far from that.

Ordered the gluten free shrimp scampi to go. Food was bland, shrimp was bland, even had a piece of the shell from the tail in my food. My dish was also not labeled as gluten free, so I have to wonder if it was even gluten free to begin with. 

Pretty disappointed in my dish and the shell in my food. Doesn't take much to end my trips to restaurants, but that will probably be my last at this location."}
{"text":"Ok this is my niece and nephew  favorite restaurant... Yes this place GREAT for kids...one loves the butter noodles and the other like the Mac and cheese.. The portions are good I got the Cajun chicken pene pasta which is delicious too. The bread stick they give you is so addictive... This is the place I go often when I have the kids on an outing."}
{"text":"This place is as the name suggest 'nothing but noodles'.  They offer several pasta dishes with different sauces and you have the choice to add meat to some dishes and others already have meat.  The combinations are nothing special and somewhat overpowering sauces.  The beauty of this place is that they sponsor many fundraisers for area schools, ETES being one and 25% of proceeds go to that particular school during that time which is great reason to support this place."}
{"text":"Very pleasant surprise. With a name like that I didn't expect much more than noodles. But to my surprise they have a very good menu. The place was clean and spacious. You order at the counter and they bring it out. I had the Lobster Ravioli which was excellent my friend hat the shrimp scampi which was excellent as well. There's good parking right across the street and no reason not to give it a try."}
{"text":"I am so glad that I just found out about this place now.  I am a breadstick lover and they sell breadsticks, 5 for 92 cents.  Delicious, delicious breadsticks.  

I ordered the mac and cheese, filled up my water cup, found a table and within a few minutes they brought my delicious cheesy pasta to my table.  That pasta was enough for two dinners.  

I will be going back here for the breadsticks, and the breadsticks and did I mention the breadsticks?"}
{"text":"For some reason I expected more from them. I came in around 5:35pm on a Wed night. All employees standing around giggling and joking behind the counter. 
I ordered the shrimp scampi with a few veggies and added a kid's chicken Alfredo with broccoli. Yes service was quick. But when I brought it home. I was not impressed. Everything was sooo bland. I'm thinking ok, this may have been me.. so I saved it and will try again the next day. Reheat it and try again. I'm not happy, everything was soo bland. I'm very disappointed. Maybe the employees would stop joking around and pay attention to the food a bit more than it wouldn't taste like they really don't care much about what they put out. I'm not sure if I'll come back!"}
{"text":"Very good food, and perfect portion size. Definitely worth more visits in the near future."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try this place every time I see it on visits to our son who lives just up the road. I finally went there with our almost 2-year-old grandson and we all loved it!  His and my tastes are simple, just buttered noodles (I added shrimp to mine) and a choice of 3 veggies (broccoli, mushrooms and zuchini for me) and good ol' mac and cheese for him.  Great finger food (grandson, not me LOL) and it really hits the spot.  Just had to take my younger son there last weekend and he thought his baked stuffed pasta shells were great, too!

Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Much better than last year!  They must have a decent saucier now. The Alfredo was right on.  [Oh my!  I just realized that their sauces must now just come out of a can.  I wish they'd tell us if they are freshly made.)"}
{"text":"Used to love NBN because of it's suited for everyone menu. We have been going here for more than a year (since we discovered it). 
This last visit was beyond disappointing. 

Firstly, they changed an ingredient and ruined the flavor of the dish. When i asked to have it made without it as i never eat it, they grumbled. The dish was redone BUT WAS UNCOOKED.  

So again i complained. The guy in charge was CLEARLY TOLD IT'S UNCOOKED. He replied he couldn't understand the problem. Seriously? 

I wanted to leave and wanted my money back. They refunded my part of the check not my husbands WHEN I CLEARLY SAID WE DO NOT WANT TO EAT HERE ANYMORE AND WANT A REFUND. He left his noodles UNTOUCHED. Still we paid for them. The worst is we asked for a FULL refund and were told we would be getting it. Yeah right? What a LIE.  

Is THIS how you 'resolve' complaints? Let alone an apology for such a negative experience, you didn't even have the courtesy and decency to refund the FULL AMOUNT for an order AFTER being told to do so.

Do you have a problem listening or is the command of the English language a challenge for you. Either way there is NO excuse for treating a customer with such little regard.   

Too bad there is nothing below a one star. Even that is a compliment for your terrible service. 
 
You are crooks!! You are Liars. And that's as simple as THAT."}
{"text":"Craving something good but can't decide between Italian food or Asian food? Then this is the place to stop at. Similar to Noodles And Company but more of a local twist that makes this place unique. Wide variety of foods to choose from and can be customized to fill your craving needs. Lots of space and service is friendly. Prices can range from $10-$13 average per person. Downside about location is that parking is curbside so be ready to look for parking."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mac and cheese!!!! I get it every time I am in town... And the breadsticks are killer"}
{"text":"This place is terrible.
I would never recommend it to anyone.
The two pasta I ordered Margherita Pasta and Fettuccini Alfredo  were tasteless. There were only a few pieces tomatos in Margherita Pasta, nothing else.
Even the most important ingredient: Pasta was not cooked properly.
People who work there have no positive energy at all. 
The cooks are really slow and don't seem to know what they are doing.
Each dish was about $7-10. Totally not worth that much money.
There is no meat in any of the pasta. You have to order meat on the side.
I would suggest you just stay home, boil some pasta and add a can of Campbell soup. It would probably taste better than nothing but noodles. Seriously, it is nothing but tasteless uncooked noodles."}
{"text":"The entrees are HUGE, I normally split an entire with my spouse because they are so large. The bread sticks are literally melt in your mouth. I think the price point is really great for the quality and combinations that are available. The restaurant is always very clean and orderly as well. They do student discounts for CPCC students!"}
{"text":"I wasn't pleased with the chicken added to my salad. I assumed it would've been grilled boneless chicken breast, but instead I received chopped up little bits of dry chicken. Overall just wasn't pleased with quality or portion for the additional money I had to spend. I ended up picking the meat out and just eating the salad which I have no complaints about. As this was my first visit, if I return I know not to add protein to my salad, or maybe I'll just try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"With an upset stomach, but in need of some dinner, I decided some plain old noodles may be exactly what I needed.  

Over past the Chick-Fil-A and next to Flying Biscuit, at 5:30 it was already starting to fill with families.  The restaurant is LOUD.  Even at first arrival, when there was hardly anyone there, there is a higher noise level than it would appear.  But since I don't have children, I am more aware of noise than other folks who have been deafened by the incessant rumble of crumb snatchers may not notice.

You stand in line to order and are given your drink cup(s) and a number to put at your table.  When your order is ready the fast wait staff whisk it to your table.  Everyone employed there that I encountered was smiling, friendly and helpful. 

I ordered the 3 Cheese Macaroni ($6) with a soft drink ($1.79) and COTTON CANDY ($1).  As another reviewer stated, the 3 cheese mac was pretty meh - the sauce could be thicker, as it really just seemed like pasta water with some cheese residue in it.  But it was fine - and it arrived to the table smoking hot.  The bread stick served with the pasta was DELICIOUS.  I could have eaten a 5 lb. sack full of just their breadsticks.  Sodas were self serve with Coke products and teas.  And the cotton candy, as silly as this sounds, was the highlight of the meal.  It's hard to find cotton candy and for whatever reason, this absolutely hit the spot as I sat at the table delighting in the blue spun sugar.  

It was fine.  I would go again when feeling better to try something else.  A woman sitting near me had a pasta dish with some tomatoes and something green that looked quite good.  Dinner was less than $10 and I left fat, full and happy, so it's all good."}
{"text":"I love Nothing But Noodles! It may seem pricey, but I always end up bringing home left overs and adding three veggies for $0.99 or two bread sticks for like $0.50 is awesome. I have enjoyed everything I've ordered (and tasted off of other's plate's) with the small exception of their Mac -n- Cheese. Capatelli Primavera, Spicy Japanese Noodles, and Chipotle Pasta are my favorites! Yummy! I'm usually here 2-4 times a month."}
{"text":"1st Time trying it was very good and reasonable.  It also filled us up. We will definitely be back as service was friendly and quick. If you like pasta this should be a place you try."}
{"text":"This place is great. If you like Noodles & Company then you will definitely like this place. This place is just better. I ordered the Spicy Japanese Noodles with chicken. This was my first time here and everyone was nice and patient with me when taking my order. Will definitely come back to this place again. Looking at what some other folks ordered I can definitely say that you can't go wrong with anything that you get here. They also have a gluten free options for their dishes as well."}
{"text":"Feel in love with this place in Charlotte. You can choose a wide option of items from the menu. I loved the Asian/ Thai flare that I could get here. No matter if you like Italian, Asian, or most any other ethnic taste....you can find it here."}
{"text":"Based upon multiple visits: best tomato basil soup in town! Made per order from scratch! Who does this? Awesome result!

Have only had the Chicken Parm entree. It was average for a chain restaurant. If I wanted the genuine Italian article, I would've gone to a genuine Italian restaurant.

As far as service goes, no complaints. Fast and courteous for a bunch of teenagers."}
{"text":"Although a noodle fan I don't care for their preparations which are mostly soy flavored.  I lived in Japan for two years and have worked in and out of Asia for years and am maxed out on teriyaki and other soy dishes.

I eat the bread and dumplings while those I am with go with their noodles.  I have been suggested to and encouraged to try the cajun pasta and I promise that I will.

That said, our son loves it.  It is his form of noodle heaven and he would live on noodles if he could.  He likes the varieties and the spicy dishes.  It is more than just a bowl of Asian pasta.

Drinks are self-serve, service is friendly and they will answer any questions you have.  And it is clean and maintained that way, even during the lunch crush."}
{"text":"We have gone to the NBN on Rea Rd for a quick pre-movie meal a few times.  While the food is definitely not outstanding, it is decent and relatively fast.  We went to the Steele Creek location yesterday and the food is the same.  My main gripe with it is that they nickel and dime you for everything for everything extra.  If you want chciken in your lo mein, it will cost an extra few dollars for only four ounces.  Same goes for their Italian style dishes.  Once you add it up, you can get better food cheaper at the local Chinese restaurant, or at the pizza place, for less money.  The only time we will eat here is if we have a coupon so it makes it more reasonable.  I have met the owner of the local franchises though, and he is a good guy that does a lot in community.  Oh, there are also a lot of kids running around in the place too.  One almost got ran over by an employee carrying food."}
{"text":"Nothing But Noodles is a big supporter of the fundraising Charlotte Citipass books we sell.  For this reason, they have some good coupons in the book, which makes eating here worth the price.  At regular prices, I would feel kind of cheated.  Most of the food is good, and the sesame lo mein, as at the other NBN locations, is on par with any I have had at any Asian restaurant.  The people here are also very friendly.  They make everything fast but fresh.  It's actually not a place I set out to go, but a place we may go before a movie because it's quick and inexpensive with a discount.  They get a star deducted because everything is served plain, then you pay an extra $2-3 for beef, chicken shrimp, lo mein, etc.  That puts their Asian dishes around $10, and you can easily get real Asian food for about $6 including the proteins.  There are also a lot of parents with kids in here as Ballanytne seems to have an abundance of soccer moms, but that's not always bad :)"}
{"text":"Bad, bad, bad... No breadsticks, no silverware, no clean tables. I think this place is gonna be closing it's doors very soon."}
{"text":"I remember when this chain was pretty new, and the location in Albuquerque served up giant bowls of hot delicious noodles with perfect sauce. The mac & cheese... to die for. It was like the Chipotle of noodle places... fast, easy, fresh (-tasting, at least) and delicious, enough food to last you for a couple future meals. 

But that was like, 5 years ago. And when I recently went to this location I was sooo disappointed. The portions have shrunk drastically. My alfredo sauce was chunky, the butter separated into a cold greasy puddle halfway through the meal. The noodles were a little too firm. And it was too expensive for such a lackluster bowl o pasta.

My boyfriend said the marinara sauce on his bowl was really good, and he's a marinara fiend... so that's the only reason it gets an extra star."}
{"text":"This popular noodle joint has been a family favorite of ours for the past 10 years. Lots of healthy menu choices (or not). My favorites include the Spicy Japanese Udon noodles and the Thai noodles but all types available, including Italian.

Fresh breadsticks are very tasty and accompany most dishes. If not, an extra five can be purchased for around a buck. (I dare you not to order extra.) It's not well known  but you can also purchase a side of mixed veggies for a buck. The dumplings are a great appetizer. Everything's prepared fresh in open kitchen. Economically priced kids meals but can be a bit pricey otherwise.

It is well managed  and service is consistently excellent. You order at counter and they deliver to your table. Drinks are self-serve including an excellent black tea. Expect long lines during peak dinner hours but things move along pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Wow this spot is great for a pre movie meal! They have tons of choices for the carb lover in you and some other stuff that I didn't even bother to pay attention to cause let's face it you want some pasta if you're coming here.

The restaurant itself is really clean and efficient, it's also freaking loud. I mean between the open kitchen's clanging pots and pans and all the people sitting around you talking it's just a hot mess. The food is pretty yummy though I got the lobster ravioli while my friend got the fettuccine alfredo and both came out super fast too. Just don't come here if you're hungover or have a headache and you'll be pretty happy."}
{"text":"Always consistent and fast. We love the beef stroganoff and bruschetta. Even when we get take out the food is always hot and yummy. 

This location is our fav as there is more parking and less congestion. Plus the staff is super nice."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick lunch or non-dressy dinner. Fast service, fair prices and tasty food. Not authentic Chinese or Italian food by any means. Think fast food for noodle dishes. 
The outside seating is very nice when the weather allows and comes with the added entertainment of watching people sit in the chikfila drivethrough for up to 45 minutes during lunch."}
{"text":"The food is ok, lobster ravioli was wayyyy too spicy for me.  I got the shrimp scampi too, it could have used a little more sauce.  The meatballs, right out of a bag.  I'll go back and try something different soon.  
Cashier always has an attitude, the rest of the staff are just stone faced."}
{"text":"This is one of the first noodle joints I had tried in Charlotte and have stuck with since the opening of many more around the area. 

I'll keep my review to the point. It has noodles from the major regions of the world and you choose the meat or veggie that you want. This location is a fairly decent size, but I wouldn't imagine bringing a huge group inside. 

The food I always end up getting is of good quality and freshness. I've never had a bad experience here, hence, the reason why I keep coming back. Their udon noodle and pad thai isn't too bad if you're looking for a quick fix, but not the best for sure. Fairly decent pricing, depending on what meat you usually get. Waiting staff is courteous and prompt and always willing to make things right."}
{"text":"Not too shabby. They do have an excellent binder available behind the counter with allergies and even a menu outlining which items are vegan or can be made vegan. 
I went with the Spicy Japanese Noodles which just had a hint of spice. i did enjoy the thick Udon noodles with mushrooms, broccoli, and carrots. The mushrooms and broccoli seemed a little sparse, they were all just small pieces mixed in. The tofu i added to the dish was done well, but again didn't seem to get a ton.
Overall, it's a good place to meet someone working at the hospital for lunch."}
{"text":"Really Good Food!! I eat here almost every week!! Best dishes are Spicy Cajun and Southwest Chipotle."}
{"text":"Not too impressed. if you are looking for fast food that's decent, and around $10, then it's ok. If you work close by, and need a quick lunch, then I imagine I would eat here. I would rather go across the shopping center to City Tavern though, or next door to Jo Jo Chinese Rest, which is ten times better than this place!
I had to go back and make sure my filters were set correctly, and this place still came up as #1 rated. This is embarassing for Charlotte to say a fast food \"noodle place\", chain restaurant is the best \"Asian Fusion\" place to eat in Charlotte.
I don't even know what else to say about it."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed AT ALL, I remember when they were in the Whitehall area and the food was great!. but when they moved I guess the recipe changed which it shouldn't. My Japanese bow had to many veggies, noodles were over cooked, and the spinach on the side was bland with no seasoning. I used uber eats and I wasted 26 dollars. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"i love this place , it is not to far from where I worked so I am in there a lot . i really love there pesto sauce and there pop sticks .witch I had for the first time the other day and next this time I go back I will be getting the pop sticks again . I also like the staff , not only that they are very nice some of the guys there are sexy as well.  so I go there for good food and sexy guys ."}
{"text":"This place just open up in my neighborhood, hubby and I  went there for dinner, I had the udon noodles and hubby had the Cajon pasta,  mine was good, but hubby was not good. A place where if you are hungry just to grab a bite. Customer service was excellent couldn't get better, great service. Beside most of the stuff comes vegetarian and if you want a side of protein you have to order it."}
{"text":"This was my first visit.. Took \"spicy Japanese noodles\" It was tasty but not completely cooked, hard to chew, not sure if its the nature of Japanese noodles.."}
{"text":"Tasty! Got take out and it was ready in 15 minutes. Loved how organized our containers were! We ordered quite a few things but they were all really good and packed well. Great service/food!"}
{"text":"Great variety of noodles and pasta. Quick service and like fast food counters. But looks like all the pasta and noodles are picked up from the freezer. Adding protein is expensive about 3$."}
{"text":"Just discovered this place and I was pretty happy with it. I had Pad Thai with chicken. The food was incredibly hot and really fresh with lots of little bits and bobs. I was surprised, however, by how expensive the meal was. Last night at a designated Thai restaurant my wife had a serving of Pad Thai with shrimp that was twice as large and definitely a bit better. Still, not a bad place to swing through if you want something above fast food. Everything seemed to be of very good quality (although there sweet tea was definitely not very sweet at all)."}
{"text":"I came here on a busy lunch hour with a party of 6. We ordered all different dishes: Japanese Udon, Capanelli primavera, magherita pasta, butter pasta, spinach salad and basil pesto. Overall, food tasted fresh, portions are plenty and service is friendly! The basil pesto was the best dish of all, I will say the vegetables were over cooked in all the dishes but the flavors are Very pleasant."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants, I wish they would expand and open up some more locations.....I always get the same thing, I believe its Southwest Chipotle with whole wheat penne then the garden salad with Balsamic....never disappoints....I get to snack on my gf's left overs which is always something different as well. I have never had anything bad from this place.

I've also never seen an entire staff that works so hard, everyone that works there is running around doing everything from cleaning windows, running orders, taking orders, cleaning bathroom....if they see something that needs to be done, it gets done.....They got extra credit on the sanitation score! 

Love this place....wish they would stay open later on the weekends though....I think they close at 8 or 9 on Sunday I'd like to see them open until at least 10."}
{"text":"Nice \"fast food\" style place for . It's a mix of Asian and Italian which isn't very common from what I've seen. Value is really good for the portion."}
{"text":"I have an addictive personality so once i find something I like I can't get enough of it. I found out about NBN at an office meeting that was catered by them. Ever since then it's been love at first sight lol. The pasta is fresh and made to order, not to mention there are so many options, from Asian to Italian dishes. All pasta entrees come with a breadstick. Portions are really good and so is the pricing. Appetizers are great too! I've had the tomato bisque with extra cream and it was delicious.Their salads are great too. There's plenty of options for kids as well. The space is pretty by so it's good for a group plus there is outdoor seating for sunny days. I've visited several times and it's turned into a family favorite. I've been pleased with every dish I have tried ( pasta campanelli, spicy Cajun pasta, pesto pasta, lobster ravioli, and the kids pizza - don't judge me lol. The staff is always friendly there's a points/ rewards system here so for every purchase you get points that ultimately result in 10$ of your meal once you reach a specific number (I'm not sure what it is) lol."}
{"text":"I eat here with friends nearly every Friday.
The food and service is great.  They understand taking care of loyal customers and it keeps us coming back every week.

I recommend the Basil-Pesto Noodles!"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!! 

Plenty of vegan options and other options you can \"veganize\" meat substitutes available (tofu) and additional veggies you can mix and match and add. 

The customer service is phenomenal!! Maddie was our server/cashier both times and was super patient and kind with our orders and restrictions etc. she even took the time to find a vegan menu! Management is always around to make sure service and overall experience is as pleasant as the food! 

Majority of the Asian dishes are already vegan or can easily be \"veganized\" 

I ordered a half spinach and cranberry salad, (which is already vegan) it was fantastic!! 

The portions for both the noodle dish and the salad are visually descent but surprisingly satisfying (the half salad was larger than expected, which is always a plus ) !! 

The atmosphere is very family oriented and very clean, friendly, and they support a local ice pop business as well !  

Would definitely return again!!"}
{"text":"We dined there Friday night. All 10 of us were happy with our food! I tried a salad for something different it was delicious and huge!"}
{"text":"WOW! I can not say enough great things about this place. My brother and I went there last night (11/10/12) before a show across town at The Fillmore. I was hesitant to drive across town and recommend a restaurant that I've only been to one other time. On top of that, he tends to be extremely \"'picky\", when it comes to food. 

Long story, short, we each had a meal and a salad. Mine topped with shrimp and my brothers topped with chicken. Everything was fantastic!

I would like to give a personal \"shout out\" to Luis (not sure on the spelling?) The past two times I have been to this establishment, his customer service has been above and beyond. My brother and I even had a chance to chat with him, after he cleared our table. The owner is blessed to have him.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Four thumbs up!!!!"}
{"text":"Okay, so I'm a little embarrassed to say this but I love this place so much that I have dedicated myself to working through the ENTIRE menu like an employee or something. I'm a super foodie so I'll try anything, and they have a TON to try. Super nice people behind the counter too! Oh, and it's all fresh and not pre made! Love the udon!"}
{"text":"They substituted canned tomatoes for the fresh diced variety, and the taste took a nosedive.
Unfortunately, the manager is clueless, and the issue was not fixed satisfactorily.
It is a pity that a place we used to enjoy has crashed out of our list."}
{"text":"This place is never open.  Multiple times have called and phone just rings.  Even during hours that it says the business is open.  If you are not going to be open, it would be nice for your business hours to reflect that.  This way people do not waste time searching menu for food only to call in and no one is answering the phones."}
{"text":"The selection of food was not just limited to noodles, being that I have eliminated carbs and meat for Lent, I was still able to enjoy a tasty, healthy well seasoned lunch. I definitely recommend the Asian salad and tomato bisque soup, absolutely delightful. I also had the lettuce wrap, no chicken extra veggies. Yummy! The staff's service was spot on, will definitely recommend and return."}
{"text":"I called ahead because I was placing an order through UberEATS and spoke with Lindsay. I asked about the spiciness of the sweet Thai sauce on the Pad Thai because I'm sensitive to spicy. She gave me confidence that it wouldn't be too spicy but suggested I just include in the UberEATS special instructions to have the sauce on the side. She immediately said she would intercept my order when it came through to make sure they got it right. Once my order was delivered I opened the bag to a thoughtful note to let me know she had included a Japanese sauce on the side as well at no extra charge just in case the Thai sauce was too spicy. I thought that was incredibly kind! The service of a take out order was cared for as if I went in to the restaurant and ordered myself! The food was great. And Lindsay was right the sauce wasn't too spicy! 
Thanks NBN!!"}
{"text":"I love pasta so i decided to try this place. My meal was great. The cashier offered me his suggestions and i tried one of his and added chicken. I think they are a little over priced but they are still good. The restaurant was clean and the staff was extremely helpful."}
{"text":"Great food and very efficient.  I've tried a variety of things from their menu and always enjoyed the food.

If you're looking for a quick dinner after work, this is the perfect place.  It's a very child-friendly place and has a somewhat loud atmosphere which also helps if you have a couple of kids acting like hyena's.

They have a nice variety on their menu from salads, soups, desserts to obviously, noodles.  They serve American, Asian and Italian style dishes and have a small selection of beers --for when the hyena's are in full swing :)

It's a cafe style setup with booths, tables --which can be joined, to bar arrangements."}
{"text":"i used to go to this place for lunch all the time! i absolutely love their eggplant parmesan! friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"We were out and wanted to find something quick beside fast food. Went here because we had tried the one in Stonecrest before. couldn't be more disappointed, the food wasn't good, very greasy and salty, doesn't taste like the one we had in Stonecrest, the table was sticky, not very clean, and the A.C was not working on a 90 degree day. The thing that bothers me the most is that I checked the nutrtion on their website, the calories and sodium of eating a bowl of noodle are a lot worse than eating fast food. I mean, a lot, a lot, it's a shocking discovery!!"}
{"text":"I had to visit twice before I wrote a review to make sure what I experienced the first time was real. Well it was.

Took my wife here for the first time, promising a tasty, healthy meal. She was not disappointed. The whole building smells incredible as soon as you walk in. With unlimited choices of combos being able to add any protein to any noodle dish or salad is great. Great local art on the walls, and a general cozy feel.

You order your food, get a number ala Showmars or McAllisters. They bring it out, very happily. All the workers genuinely seem happy, which is rare.

Great spot for lunch, although might be a bit pricey but for the quality, as well as quantity (usually 2 lunches worth) it is well worth a visit to this once ghost town of a road as construction all but shut it down for almost a year.

Something for everyone, even veggies, you're missing out for not having been here."}
{"text":"I am shocked to see a 3 star review and words like bland. This place is awesome. We have been several times since it opened up and the best thing  about our experiences has been the consistency. We've always had tremendous service and the food has been better than expected in relation to other noodle spots around the QC. If you're looking for a quick and tasty meal, you found it. Do the world a favor and drop off those t-shirts you've been hoarding in your closet while you're there( it's next to a goodwill). Enjoy!"}
{"text":"OK so your a noodle place...I did not see one sign of making the noodles or do they.? Had chicken lo mein but did not see the chicken I asked and was told its there.....Oh really   sure it is... And that and a  million dollars and you will win the Lotto.As I tasted the bowl of noodles there was a strong vinegar taste . Not sure if I have ever had Lo mein that had a Vinegar taste  still trying to figure that one out.
            Maybe pickles got dropped in the noodles?As you can see not many people for lunch but, there was a long line next door at Zaxbys?The King of fast food HUH?"}
{"text":"I have always loved everything I have ever eaten at Nothing But Noodles. However, the last time I ordered the pear spinach salad and the pears where hard and tasteless. All around, though, I really love it here. I will definitely continue to eat here! I love the Caribbean black tea!!"}
{"text":"Nothing but noodles is DELICIOUS. It definitely stands out in the Stonecrest area, and the food is very tasty. There are many noodle options and also non-noodle options. Service is quick. Maneuvering around and figuring out what you're supposed to do is easy if it's your first time. 

The only thing that keeps me from going is the nutrition facts for some of their entrees. You can find them here at this website: http://www.nothingbutnoodles.com/myfiles/pdf/nutritional_information.pdf"}
{"text":"LOVE the breadsticks!! One comes with each pasta, but we definitely enjoy getting a few extra ;)"}
{"text":"I really love the atmosphere of this place!  Was here last week for lunch and the menu has something for everyone, even tofu is an option for your bowl!!  YUM!  The concept is a bowl of noodles and you can pick how you want them, Italian, Asian etc etc. with add-ons like chicken or meatballs etc.  

I got the Spicy Asian Chicken bowl and my noodles were over done and the sauce was like peanut butter mixed with water...weird texture and flavor.  BUT my friend got the chicken pad thai and he couldnt finish it so I polished it off for him.....delicious!!!   

I will go again and try more things on the menu because why would I just go here for pad thai when I can get the best pad thai in Charlotte at the Thai House??  I wish I could give 3 and a half stars because even though it is a little pricey (16 bucks for two people WITH a bogo coupon???), the portions are pretty large, you could easily split a noodle bowl with someone.  All in all NBN is rounding off at A-OK!  :-D"}
{"text":"Wow. So many noodle options. I got the Japanese noodles, which were ok. Big portion too.

Seems like this is the kid/teenager hangout, so it's rather loud.

Don't forget the Yelp check-in for a free drink."}
{"text":"Sorry 'bout the empty bowl, I couldn't wait. This is my third visit here, we live an hour away. It seems that we always get something with shrimp. They have lots of other options which I assume are just as awesome. One day, I'll explore the menu! Cookies are top notch and the rest of the deserts look great as well. 
Dining area is open, perhaps a little on the noisy side. Plenty of seating inside and out. CLEAN, 97% RATING."}
{"text":"We were just in town for the weekend and stopped by on a Sunday... we liked the menu and as we were deciding what to eat, but staff started putting chairs on top of the tables... That seems kind of odd and then we realized they were closing down.

We must've walked in at about 1:55 PM and it turns out they close at 2 PM sharp on Sunday... Who knew? That didn't seem very welcoming with chairs and tables and employees shutting down so we left and will never be able to try this place because we are going back home tomorrow ... can't really rate it, aside from the fact that it didn't seem very welcoming... That's how I feel ."}
{"text":"Wow, does everyone come here for Pad Thai instead of just go get Thai?! Yeah, it was a little chilly, but the food was good and warm! This place wouldn't, though, have been what it was without one of those teenagers (who need a job too), Sydney. She was AMAZING! She was pleasant and polite, and overly helpful in making suggestions and recommending foods. She made sure we were taken care of, asked if we needed anything, didn't rush us when the time was getting near close on a Saturday night... The most disappointing part of it all is that this is the best way she knew of to thank her for a job well done. I was so glad this is where we decided to eat dinner so that it could be such a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"We tried this place on a sunday at lunch. It was not that busy and seemed pretty clean. It has a casual fast food vibe like chipotle or moes except everything is noodles. Italian , macaroni, asian, whatever. If its noodles they have it. I ordered the pad thai noodles and we had an order of pot stickers. The pad thai was surprisingly good and the pot stickers were decent. Food came fast and service was good. The only reason I cant rate it higher is the price. I think the pad thai is like $7.50 which sounds about right for a fast food place. A nice sit down restaurant you would pay $8 to $9 until you realize all noodles dishes you have to pay extra for meat, so $3.50 extra for chicken in your pad thai puts you at $11 for your bowl of noodles which is getting into almost $$$ scale at sit down full service restaurants. Decent choice if you are out shopping and dont want a lot of hassle but kind of pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"We LOVE NBN! My husband is obsessed with the beef stroganoff and I almost always get the paid thai. We love the lettuce wraps & dumplings, too. We had NBN cater our wedding and all the guests raved about the food, too. We definitely recommend to anyone. We have never had bad service, and even when busy the food doesn't take long to come out."}
{"text":"This place is down-right dangerous! I could eat here just about everyday. The service is great and super fast, staff is awesome.
Just get there before 12:30 to beat the lunch crowd."}
{"text":"Gluten free options! First timer here and it was delicious.

You place your order at the register, select a seat and they bring your food out to you. We selected the outdoor patio because it was dog friendly and our dog was with us. The staff was very friendly and helpful. They even brought our dog water. 

Beer and wine are available

We recommend the lobster ravioli!!"}
{"text":"I came here one night one a whim I had the pad Thai it really wasn't memorable it was just ok"}
{"text":"My husband & I have been coming to Nothing But Noodles since we moved to Charlotte.  I LOVE the concept of the place.  And (surprise!) they actually DO have more than just noodles (yummy breadsticks, meatballs, salads, soup...).  

I exclusively order the Alfredo pasta.  It is consistently AMAZING.  Always hot & freshly made.  My husband rotates between the Pesto, the Spicy Japanese noodles and the Capellini Primavera.  He loves them all and it's always a difficult choice.  

I can't say enough how much I love this place!  It's also a great place to meet a friend or group of friends for lunch or dinner because there is something for everyone!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. Yes, it's standard noodle place, but I eat here whenever I'm in Stonecrest. Its sit down as well as take out. I'm not sure why one $ is listed because a meal and a drink will run you above $10. So it's a bit pricey for what you are getting, but I can't find noodles as good anywhere else. I always get the Pad Thai noodles with beef. I've tried some of the american dishes as well but I always go back to my favorite. Definitely give the place a try"}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times since they have opened. The food is always fresh and delicious! Everyone that works there is outstanding! They are always willing to go above and beyond. The entire place is kept very clean. I wish they had a loyalty program of sorts! I love all the options they have. The next time I order, I will make sure to take a picture! :) If you happen to be in the area, you need to stop by and check this place out!"}
{"text":"My daughters preschool was doing a charity / contest thingy which is why I went with the family.  NB wasn't really on my radar, es specially since I've been on a gluten free kick but I have to say it was different than I expected.

Walked in not knowing what the menu was going to be like, but did notice the sign that they have gluten free options which was a nice surprise.  Upon entering, I forgot why I dislike the Stonecrest area so much.....the crowds and swarms of minivan driving moms were everywhere!  NBN was pretty full and very noisy!  After a long, hard laborious day at work a nice quiet restaurant would have been nice.  Luckily they offered outdoor seating which was more quiet.  The fried chicken smell from Chic Fil A right next door waifed over the entire time which was embarrassingly nice.

I ordered the Spicy Japanese Noodles with the GF Rice Noodles.  The portion was large and to my surprise, right tasty!  Al Dente, rice noodles with a spicy kick.  Kiddoes had the mac and cheese, and the wife had the shrimp primavera all were nicely done and there were no complaints.  Dinner was around $35.00 which is a bit high, like Chad E. said just for noodles.  It was for the school so not a huge deal.

Service was good, they had plenty of waitstaff and they were very attentive with refills and anything else we needed."}
{"text":"I used to love this place!!!! For years I would drive miles just to eat here..not anymore.  Quality of the food is way different and staff needs some adjusting.  Met my friend there for lunch today.  We got our food and there was a long black hair in her food.  There were two young ladies working near the food who had long black hair... I just think that if your near the food prep area you should have a hair net, hat or find somewhere else to be.   So gross...  I was trying to eat my sesame Lo mein  with beef.. It was bad enough that the beef was all fat and rubbery then I saw the hair in my friends bowl.. That was it for me... Won't go back...

Ps.  While we were there what appeared to be a supervisor or manager, yelled at an employee while he was having his lunch.  It was so obnoxious. All the patrons around him shook their heads in disbelief...you guys have gone down in food quality and staff quality...not good for business."}
{"text":"The noodles here are just too good!!!! I love them and they're so delicious!!! The spicy Japanese udon and fettuccine Alfredo is delicious. I'm going back there today to try a different type of noodles. Highly recommended! Great price and great portions!!!"}
{"text":"I don't always eat pasta, but when I do, I choose Nothing But Noodles. LOL!!!!  I usually opt for their Asian dishes, but I decided to try the fettuccine the last time I went.  It was good--a little sauce heavy, but good.  I added broccoli and it was a bit overcooked (I like my broccoli a bit on the hard side) but I still cleaned my plate so it couldn't have been that bad, right? Good service.  Good location. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great food for a great price. Never actually ate in but the to-go system is pretty good and the food is always delicious."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of being served by Niko, Matty & Saed. They were friendly & available as soon as I entered the establishment. The dishes that I tasted were fair & could have used more seasoning. I Objectively state that I probably eat seasoning more than the average person. So my fair rating may be a good rating to the average consumer.The serving sizes were plentiful and I had enough food to take some home. Also I was elated that my spinach salad have more Spinach than Pasta which is exactly what I wanted . They also have Otis Spunkenmier cookies. Bathrooms were spotless. A+ thank you Niko, Saed, Matty"}
{"text":"I'm thinking about a frivolous lawsuit due to their misnomer. They have a lot more than noodles! The lobster ravioli is fantastic, the pizza is molto bene! They have lots of great healthy choices, great tasting food and quick service. 
This is like a higher-end Noodles and Company. I like it better, too. There are American, Asian and Italian options. The breadsticks rock."}
{"text":"Nothing but Noodles has become our go to place with the kids. There is something for everyone. They take Mac and Cheese to a new level. My wife gets the Asian Salad or the Spicy Cajun Chicken each time. As a tip you can get extra noodles for a few dollars more. 

Do not worry about seating when you walk in. Service is fast and people will be done by the time you order and look for a seat."}
{"text":"This place is a small walk away from CPCC.

For a place that claims they have NOTHING but noodles, they had a pretty decent Greek salad. It was plated nicely, tasted pretty good (and fresh), and they added a little fusilli pasta to the top.

The atmosphere is open and quiet and the price is just right."}
{"text":"Extremely happy to find a cheap restaurant with a Gluten-Free menu. I was pleasantly surprised with the number of options that I could actually enjoy. Yeah for Mac&Cheese !"}
{"text":"Experienced an amazing display of customer service today. Stopped by NBN to grab a quick bite to eat after the movies and had my order taken by Steven Nguyen. He really paid attention to my order, offered to answer any addl questions I had pertaining to what I was getting and the food was piping hot & delicious. Highly suggested place to eat if you're ever in the Piper Glen/Ballantine area. 5 's!"}
{"text":"I wish I could have gone 2.5 instead of three.  

The cashier/order taker was being trained and was slow and didn't speak great English and didn't know how to count change.

The cooking of the food was slow as well.  Maybe I just expected it to be faster than it really is.  Staff were friendly.

The Beef Stroganoff is a bit bland, but I like things sauce-y, so I added some creamy marscapone to it when I got home & it really brightened up.  It could use a little more meat in the noodles, but the noodles weren't overcooked, which was good since I had to drive them home.

I just wanted some noodles without fuss, so this fit the bill for this evening.  Relatively easy to get in and out of except for the construction they are doing on Hawthorne, so you have to go around the block to get there... you can cut across Torrence from 4th (I think it's 4th).

Mangia!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Noodles were decent although a bit too sweet for my taste. We found it to be a bit pricey for the portions you get. Maybe I'm just spoiled by the all you can eat noodle places in CA for $10.

Service was good. They messed up one of our orders and gave us chicken instead of shrimp however when we let them know they redid it with shrimp and even took that one off the bill which was nice.

Overall decent place with big selection of noodles not just Asian style."}
{"text":"If we could give 10 stars we would. My husband and I are from CT and our daughter is in North Carolina. She recently got married and we had \"Nothing But Noodles\" cater the event and the food. They were FANTASTIC!!! From beginning to end they were extraordinary and helpful. So nice to deal with on the phone setting everything up and  outstanding the day of the wedding. They went above and beyond what we ever expected. Now on to the food..That was outstanding as well. They figured the perfect amount of food and it was absolutely delicious. From the appetizers to the salad to the main courses. We just can't say enough about them...I will not hesitate to recommend them or use them again in the future.
Do yourself a favor..Eat there...Cater with them...Anything...I guarantee it will be WONDERFUL!!!!!!!!
P.S. And the cost for all they did seems impossible...The amount we paid for our daughters wedding to be perfect, because of Nothing But Noodles, seems crazy. It was extremely economical and well worth the cost!!!!"}
{"text":"Walking in the restaurant was packed (it was a Sunday) the staff was friendly and very helpful. 
I ordered the shrimp scampi and the spicy Japanese noodles. I give a A+ on presentation for both. Japanese spicy noodle wasn't to my liking, the meat was very dry. The noodle it self was okay. Shrimp scampi was basically some shrimp and noodles tossed in melted butter. Both dishes lacked in flavor. I was very disappointed with this place.

At least they had clean bathrooms."}
{"text":"Grabbed dinner from here to go...took it over to the Visulite Theater for a concert.  It worked out perfectly.  Great food, quick service."}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie - I didn't have high hopes for NBN. I have a hard time beliving that one restaurant can master an array of cuisines and I generally tend to prefer places that specialize in one whether it be Chinese, Italian, Greek,  etc. That being said, when my co-worker suggested it I thought it couldn't hurt to at least try it out.

It is a fast-casual set up making it ideal for lunch. You order at the counter, get your number, and they bring it to you-simple and fast. 

I decided to try the spicy cajun pasta- I believe it was a VERY reasonable $7. A few minutes later and out came a heaping bowl of pasta. I could have easily split the portion into two meals for myself- but I did not have any leftoves because it was so good. I couldn't believe my taste-buds but the penne were perfectly al dente, the sauce creamy-zesty perfection, loads of slighlty-crisp red peppers and topped with grated parmesan. I honestly was shocked that this came out of a fast-casual place and cost so little. 

The restaurant itself appeared clean and pretty standard. It is ideal for lunch or a quick/super casual dinner. It also seemed very kid-friendly with choices like buttered noodles. 

I definitely will return- and am hoping it is every bit as delicious as last time!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food every time. Nice staff a little pricey for somethings but the quality is good and the place is clean.  Alfredo okay....but not very flavorful."}
{"text":"The Pad Thai has been good the couple times I've been. Fast and courteous staff is a plus."}
{"text":"I had another caterer back out the last minute for a graduation party I was hosting and desperately needed someone to cater our event.  I called Nothing but Noodles at the last minute and they came through!!

All the kids loved the pasta (Fettuccine Alfredo with shrimp, Three Cheese Mac with chicken, Marinara and Meatballs) and I couldn't have been happier with both the food and the great service from Kristen, Rachel, and the rest of the NbN staff.  My personal favorite was the Gluten Free Alfredo. The food traveled so well and was still hot and tasted great after 1.5 hours.  I was very happy with the entire catering process and will order from you guys soon again!"}
{"text":"Nothing But Noodles is pretty good. They have a couple vegetarian/vegan dishes, which is great for me. The only complaint that I have is the noodles are always slightly undercooked (al dente). Or at least they are in the Japanese Stir Fry, which is usually what I get. But the flavors are good, the place is very clean and the prices are really good. I also like the fact that you can order a small or large portion of their dishes."}
{"text":"I really dislike going out for noodles because they are so dang cheap. I mean really - you can't get ramen 10 for a buck any more, but still, even if you make a fancy dinner with the craziest, most decadent sauce you can imagine, you can treat your entire family for about what a single meal would cost. Unless maybe you put some sort of truffle on it or something. Even then, you always spend more eating out, and that's not really the point - noodles of any sort are just way worse than anything else.

At Nothing but Noodles, you can choose from all variety of noodles - you can get your Asian noodles or your noodle soup or your Italian noodles, so anyone in the family will be happy, and you can customize it to your heart's content."}
{"text":"This has easily became one of my go-to spots in Charlotte since moving here! No joke, some very good food for little $$. I got the Cajun Pasta once and it was great but the spicy Japanese noodles is by far my favorite!

If you are thinking about getting an appetizer grab the cheese sticks I promise you won't be disappointed!

Bottomline, good food, low price... Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"This needed an update!! It's been over a year since I gave one! Food here is good and quick and cheap!! I love the cajun pasta and udon noodles. Breadsticks are plain but good!! Service has always been good!"}
{"text":"Ate here again tonight with wifey. The service and food are top notch. IMO the good service you get here is becoming rare at a lot of businesses but so refreshing when you get it. As soon as you walk into Nothing But Noodles you are greeted with respect and a feeling of I'm glad you chose us for dinner tonight. When we left the restaurant I asked the crew can I take a picture of them for Yelp and they were more then happy. Please keep up the good job, good food and the excellent service you guys provide."}
{"text":"This place is Awesome, great food lots of cheese and SUPER FRIENDLY staff. My fave is Pomodoro Pasta with shrimp. Today I had the Bruschetta they provide it in a bowl separate from the bread so the bread does not get soggy. It was really good and they even gave me more bread to take home with me because I had leftover topping, I did not even ask for it. For the price this is a really great meal! I am so sad that I am moving and they don't have any of these restaurants where I am going."}
{"text":"Good and fresh served noodles. Will definitely try other items in my next visit. The noodles are delish with or without the protein, which cost extra"}
{"text":"I got the pad thai for lunch. It was delicious so I decided to come back the next day for another lunch. This time, I tried the magherita pasta, I was very disappointed. It was bland and watery. It tasted like boiled pasta with chicken and melted cheese on top."}
{"text":"I usually wouldn't leave comments but I really felt like I needed to because this place was a disappointment. It wasn't horrible but wasn't worth the $31 my boyfriend and I spent today. He got lo mien which tasted watered down (I could understand it's to make it cook faster but it didn't taste/smell good to me) , my pasta didn't taste fresh, and the thai lettuce wrap came with alot of chicken but not much variety of stuff to put in which I thought I would get more variety lol. The one at chesse cake factory is better. The good thing about this place was it was very nice, big, fast, and the people were friendly BUT just because of that I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Decent noodle dishes served fast. Kids love it. Good breadsticks and you control the pasta combos. Want pad Thai with meatballs? Have it. Great for takeout as well. Can get pretty busy on movie nights since the big Regal is across the parking lot"}
{"text":"They were closed and welcomed us inside with open arms. That's a business doing it right.

8:07pm. The roommate and I ventured here after yoga and errands. The door was locked because they closed at 8pm. The manager came running to the door and said please come on in and order. I worked in service industry a long time. I would've never made eye contact and walked far away from the door. I know, I'm awful. Heck, we were just turned away next door at Earl's because their kitchen closed at 8pm. 

There's a lot of options on this menu. The manager recommended choosing from the Asian or Italian section. He also thoroughly explained the dishes and answered all our questions. We went with the Basil Pesto (add meatballs), Spicy Japanese Noodles, Potstickers, Bruschetta, and the Spicy Cucumber Salad. Everything was good. This may sound weird, but my favorite out of all of it was the salad. I loved the flavors. 

Things to know: these are pretty good sized portions for the price. You can easily make two meals out of a bowl. Noodles has a gluten free menu and is also kid-friendly. During my latest visit here, you could get a free drink if you checked in on Yelp. Parking is available on the street and in the lot directly across from the restaurant.

That's pretty neat alert: Nothing But Noodles does a lot of fundraising efforts with local schools and organizations. They've donated over $240,000 in the last eight years."}
{"text":"After continuously passing on this place in favor of the other wonderful restaurants on Elizabeth Ave (I'm a sucker for Earl's and Viva Chicken), I finally stopped here for a pre-race carb load this past weekend. I thought the price and quality were just right!

I ordered the Pad Thai. Although it had a \"spicy\" icon next to it on the menu, I found it really flavorful but not hot at all (which was great for pre-race). The fella went tamer than me and got the buttery noodles, which were stunningly good given their simplicity.

The noodle dishes are all priced well for the quick service format of the restaurant. We ordered to-go and had two hot noodle dishes in our bag within 10 minutes of ordering. Would definitely consider stopping here again for a noodle craving!"}
{"text":"So we had been thinking about going to Olive Garden but ended up not going because they didn't have my Lobster Ravioli dish anymore. I was really in the mood for it so I searched different online menus & saw that Nothing but Noodles had it. Went in & got it & it was delicious.

The only negative thing I have to say is that the Lobster Ravioli has a really bold and spicy (which IS good! Don't get me wrong), but it covered the flavor of the lobster. I liked Olive Garden's sauce better. But that's just my opinion! 

Aside from the sauce, the food was top notch amazing! But husband loved his pasta dish - basil pesto that he added fettuccine pasta instead of the pasta it comes with. I also got a Caesar salad, which was bomb! I ordered a full salad and finished it all because it was so good. The Lobster Ravioli appears like a small dish, but it's filling. They all come with one breadstick so 

Anyways, main point: if you're want Olive Garden quality pasta for cheaper - look no further: Nothing But Noodles gotcho back!"}
{"text":"My son LOVE NOODLES almost as much as life itself.  SO......... we had high expectations.  This place did not quite measure up.  Cute theme, menu reads nicely but the food is average.  I had the Asian Salad, a miss!  it was bland and some of the ingredients were clearly older and had been sitting out with the edges of some veggies browning.  With that aside it was still an average salad, not  better than Wendy's or McDonalds new selections as  far as quality.  My son ordered Lo Mein, it was about the same. The look and theme of the restaurant lead you to feel as if you're in some sort of gourmet deli or café  - NOT THE CASE.  in the end the food did not taste any different than your mall or fast food offerings.  
would not go again.  I would not expect the chain to last, the prices lead you to expect better quality."}
{"text":"Great low key lunch spot. Fairly priced."}
{"text":"We always grab takeout from this location and the service is fast and great. Your typical fast food noodles joint, lots of variety. I enjoy getting a side of the chipotle sauce to have with my breadsticks and to sauce up the eggplant Parmesan. Pesto is one of the better ones with or without meat, you can always add extra veggies for cheaper! Taken down a star because yes it is fast food but there is always a ton of grease on the bottom of the cheesier pasta bowls."}
{"text":"I came here last Saturday after volunteering. My choice was the chicken Alfredo with breadsticks. Very pleasant, creamy taste. As soon as they finished preparing it, they brought it out. The downside to the place is the bus system. There is plenty of construction going around this area and I had to ask a passerby for help getting the bus. Therefore, I doubt if I will come back."}
{"text":"I love the food here, and really that is the true reason you come here.  They have a good selection of different types of pastas: america, italian, oriental, etc.  I recommend the margarita pasta.  It is light and still yummy.  If you are looking for something a little more indulgent, go for the stuffed shells.  Also, being vegetarian it is nice that they have tofu as a protein option.  

It is typically always busy in there and the acoustics really stink.  You can here ever whimper a child makes.  So if you are kid-skittish, bring some headphones."}
{"text":"I love love love this place! I eat here on a fairly regular basis and have yet to have anything I don't like.  The prices are great considering the huge portion size."}
{"text":"Hello friends,

Its moreso 2 Stars (Ok). Me and mine stopped by here for a quick lunch. Pretty nice layout. This was our first time here and really didn't know what to do. Finally we found out that its nothing complex at all. Read the menu and chose from it. Easy! 

The Tai Lettuce wrap thingy-majig Appetizer. ($5.99)

I ordered the Spicy Cajun Pasta with add Chicken (4oz for $2.49). My wife ordered Shrimp Scampi ($11.39) with extra Shrimp add on ($2.79). 

I found my food to be (2 Stars Meh, I've experienced better). Pasta cooked pretty well... Aldente. Nice sauce. The chicken was 1-2 stars in that it really had no flavor. It could have been tofu. The Stand out was actually the BREAD. GOOD googaly moogaly. I could (and maybe should) have just ordered the bread alone. 

Wifey really didn't enjoy her food as much as I wish I did and not as much as I did the bread. She said it was bland. Needed salt etc. so that helped me because that only means More food (unfortunately not the bread) for me and Grumbles. 

I would come back to try something else out... Maybe. With a tab of $30.00+ (food & drink) I most likely will go somewhere else. Or just come back for the bread. Did I happens to mention the bread was the highlight. 

TTFN"}
{"text":"Food was so good. I had fettuccine pasta, I asked to add chicken in it. And then I ended up having diarrhea. My stomach hurts. I'm still sitting in the toilet and taking dumps  I burped, still can taste pasta!"}
{"text":"My favorite! Inexpensive and quick. All the dishes I have tried are wonderful. I really like the Fettuccine Alfredo!   Also the bruschetta is great! Fantastic!"}
{"text":"I always enjoy this chain because....duh..I love noodles :)  This restaurant is very busy at most hours of the day and evening.  It is well organized and runs smoothly.  The staff is friendly and quick with orders.  

My food always comes out good.  The breadsticks are always fresh and warm.  Never had any problems or issues.  Never much of a wait.  There is a patio outside, but many little birds flock around, which is not my favorite thing so I just sit inside.  The only compliant I would have is that it gets extremely noisy most always.  So carryout is maybe best at this location."}
{"text":"Very good food. Very clean restaurant. Customer service is exemplary. Try the Thai lettuce wraps."}
{"text":"The pasta here is delicious. I like the pesto option. There are several different types of pasta to choose from. Service is very good and friendly. The cost is low given the quality of the food. I'm a regular here and will continue to be."}
{"text":"If you want a good spot to get a variety of noodle dishes and more, look no further than nothing but noodles! They have noodle dishes that expand from Asian to Italian, to American classics. They also have salads and apps, something for everyone in your family, including those with gluten intolerances! 

My usual go-to is their pasta primavera. It's loaded with veggies, so I feel a little healthier as I'm carb loading. The sauce that they put on here is delicate and blends with the vegetables nicely. I love the thinness of the angel hair pasta, and honestly, each bite is just really good. 

No matter what I get, I always start with an order of their dumplings. I don't know why, but they are just little delicious pillows and a great way to start your meal. The sauce has a few too many scallions for me, so I usually just go straight for the soy sauce, which is still a perfect accompaniment."}
{"text":"It's Me ... Mr.TramueL. It's been too long since my last review, in my defense I have recently subscribed to the notion of living within my means, even if I have to borrow to do so. So I've been forced to live off peanut butter & jelly sandwiches & I didn't wanna write about that. My case is a special one, I generally have to borrow a few McDolla's to enjoy a meal from the McDollanaire menu. I know you would appreciate my review of the uber delicious McRib and it's saucy, mystery meat but how many times can you (re)write about it? Don't answer, it was rhetorical.

Any who, I had a few extra dolla's thanks to the government's Making Food Affordable program and stumbled upon Nothing But Noodles && what I discovered is that they make noodles for the God's and now feature them here on Earth for us mere mortals. I ordered the Fettuccini Alfredo @ $6.89 & added 4 oz of Chicken for an additional $2.29. Good eatings GentleMen & GentleWomen. Good eatings indeed. I should mention that I tried to order from the kids menu but was unable to convince anyone that I was twelve standing at 5'12\" & a half weighing 230lbs, ok 250lbs ... you guys are impossible! 285lbs. I eat because I'm unhappy, I'm unhappy because I eat.

 \"Fettuccini pasta tossed with our freshly-made cream sauce. Garnished with parsley and freshly grated Parmesan and Romano cheeses.\"

There are a lot of great options on the menu; pasta, salad, soup, desserts and starters. The atmosphere was great, family oriented & kid friendly. Good food. I'll be back! Just as soon as I receive my final modification package for MFA (Making Food Affordable.) I think they serve beer ...

 I don't eat noodles a lot, but when I do, I prefer Nothing But Noddles ... stay hungry my friends.

Eat Well,

Mr. \"I should not have order alfredo sauce 'cause I'm lactose intolerant\" TramueL"}
{"text":"Delicious. The vegies were fresh and the noodles were good.
I was in the area and this was a good choice to try.
I am glad I stopped in."}
{"text":"Loved it!' Didn't think I would. I saw the menu and was gonna leave until bf said he'd try it. Glad we did. They actually have more than noodles and I saw Italian food on the menu, but that would be blasphemy as an Italian from New York to order that here. They suggest you look at menu and know what you want when you come up to counter to order. We decided to split the Pad Thai and you get a choice of meat, chicken, or shrimp to add if you want. We chose beef. We also ordered the Cucumber salad. We chose a drink and I picked a little bottle of Pinot Grigio and he chose beer. You pay, take ur number card and sit down. They bring it to your table. Let me tell you, the portions are big enough to split if you want. Pad Thai was delicious!! Perfectly cooked noodles, great spice and flavor, texture and the beef was tender enough to cut with a fork. Cucumber salad was huge and had carrots, red onions, cilantro, tomatoes, slivered almonds, and what looked like romaine, shredded mozzarella, (odd but ok) and iceberg lettuce and slaw. Dressing was Asian and light, needed a little more flavor but so good. I can't wait to go back! Great little place for fast, cheap, and flavorful."}
{"text":"I love this place and didn't think I would. Walk up to counter, order your food, take your number and its brought to you. I ordered the Pad Thai with Beef, Cucumber salad and I love the little bottles of wine. I sat down and a few minutes later my food came. First, let me say that the portions are big! My bf and I split both the pad thai and the huge cucumber salad. I'm Italian, so I wouldn't try any of those selections and figured I'd go Asian and my noodles were perfectly cooked, hot and fresh and my beef was tender. I love the cilantro, lime wedge, and crushed peanuts in it. The cucumber salad was cool and fresh with bold flavors like basil and cilantro. It had tomatoes, red onions, and topped with almonds and mozzarella??? That doesn't make sense and its totally unnecessary, but I didnt mind it. I love going for lunch here. Its now one of my favorite places."}
{"text":"good options to choose from. I love their concept. They offer delicious pastas. But, it is better to stay away from salads, as I couldn't enjoy it much like pasta. 
But, I wonder why these kind of places do not exist in Jersey city, NJ where I live. :( too bad."}
{"text":"Those are some tasty noodles! My first adventure into noodle land and it was a big success! My daughter suggested this place the other night, I've got to say, I think she's getting an extra gift under the tree this year for it!! All kinds of pastas to choose from and you can go veg or add some meat to it. I went with the Spicy Japanese Noodles. They use Udon noodles, my new favorite noodle! Damn, Udon, where have you been all my life. My daughter got the Mac & cheese, I liked it but the sauce needs to be just a bit thicker. The service was friendly and fast and the atomosphere is causal. I can't wait to go back, I want to try everything. By the way, the bread sticks get a 5 star all by themselves."}
{"text":"Great food. The breadsticks are a bargain and amazing. But the pasta's highlights are the fresh vegetables used in the recipes.

Good place to go after coming home from downtown. I drive here from the train station, and bring home food for the family once a week."}
{"text":"What a surprise!  Don't let the name fool you into thinking you're in for a boring meal a a bowl of noodles!  The menu is extensive enough to be confusing, and the dishes cross multiple cultural and ethnic lines.  Best of all - the food is outstanding!  I tried the place as a \"why not\", and came away with a new favorite, affordable place."}
{"text":"Since I come to this place weekly for their Seasame Lo Mein and Spicy Japanese Noodles, I owe these guys a good review. Every time I come the people are friendly, the place is clean, and I get my food quick, and I love my go to dishes. Reasonably priced if you don't add any meat as well. But even when you are craving some protein, you can keep it around $11."}
{"text":"Alright so here's the deal. Back home in Jerz, me and my gf found this phenomenal noodle place- Wild Noodlez. We go back one day, CLOSED. Our lives were a little less fulfilling without Wild Noodlez.

When I moved down to Charlotte and stumbled (and I literally mean stumbled, I fell on the curb walking there) across this place, it was like the sun began shining on my life again. I decided to wait until my gf came down for the summer to take her there. Needless to say, she was game the second she heard the title.

The place is a little bland. It didn't give me what I NEEDED. I feel like the menu OD'ed on different ethnic foods. I was simply looking for outrageous meals that include noodles, not so much just pad thai or pasta. 

I'd like to see a little less seafood and ethnicity when I check out the menu. The food is still good and serving beer (thumbs up)

Check it out if you are looking to try something new.

LBD scale- 6. Could be great with some minor menu touchups."}
{"text":"I really like the concept of this place. Primarily pasta dishes but with plenty of non pasta dishes available if that is not your thing. Real open layout and you place your order at the counter then they bring it out to you. Their menu really has a ton of choices. It's broken down into different countries or places of origin. There are American, Italian, and Asian sections plus others to choose from too. 

The prices are good for the quality and the amount of food you get. We went with the lobster ravioli and the three cheese macaroni plus an appetizer of the potstickers. Our friends ordered several other dishes and they all were superb. 

Customer service was awesome and they helped with any questions we had while we were in line. Plenty of room to dine in plus a nice patio to enjoy your meal on Elizabeth Avenue. Stop in and get some noodles and see for yourself!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for lunch and were starving. I got the shrimp scampi and it was delicious!!"}
{"text":"A suprisingly good lunch option in a Charlotte strip mall! Everything is made to order and always comes piping hot just the way you ordered it. There is never a shortage of soccer moms or screaming children in upscale kiddie clothing as this is indeed the side of town where no one is missing any meals and from what I know screaming children never killed anyone!

I like this place, I like the spicy udon noodles with tofu, so much in fact I've never tried anything else."}
{"text":"Meh, all the way. 

Greasy mediocre pastas, loud, chainish ambience. The food is so blah, I would only go back if I have to entertain a bunch a five year olds who couldn't care less about how their food tasted so long as it had cheese overload. 

The breadsticks were the saving grace which I munched on so I don't go to bed hungry. Service wasn't exceptional either."}
{"text":"3.5 Star for Lunch Specials Everyday from 11 am to 2pm!

Nothing But Noodles is a new franchise based in Scottsdale, AZ, with locations opening up in Ontario.

There is a good selections of Noodles and Pasta... and there are also soups and salads! Everything are prepared when ordered with fresh ingredients at a decent price.

Prices are reasonable from around $7 with most of them under $10 for pasta/noodle. Choices of Italian, American and Asian style, definitely something for everyone.

For lunch the Choose 2 meal Combinations at $7.25 cannot be beat!! A choice of Half Salad (I am forced to eat my green) and either a Half Noodle Bowl or Soups.

Pear & Balsamic Spinach Salad can be a meal of its own!! Loaded with Blue Cheese crumbs and tons and tons of walnuts!! Southwest Chipotle Linguine has a slight kick of spiciness with fresh pasta cooked al dente, and even has a bread stick on the side...

Nothing But Noodles has a self serve concept, you placed and paid for your order and the food will be delivered to your table.

Now I find another good place for lunch ...!!

BTW, stay away on Monday night if you don't have kids... because it is Kids Eat Free Night and that includes all the sugary soft drinks and cotton candies!!... Need I say more?"}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant. It's a chain, which would make you think the food will be crap, but it's actually very fresh and delicious. The dishes seem to be very well thought out, and the price is not bad at all. Also, they bring you the food really fast, so its a great place to go if you are really hungry."}
{"text":"Noodles, noodles, noodles. Rice noodles, wheat noodles, egg noodles. You name it, they probably do it. Things that aren't \"noodly\" but guess what? They are! Whether it's beef stroganoff or mac & cheese or fettucine alfredo.

But I didn't want any of those. Today was a \"Thai\" day and so it was the Pad Thai for me. Brought out to my table a few minutes later, it had all the visual requirements - bits of egg, a garnish of cilantro, peanuts and a sliver of lime. But where it was missing out was the zing spiciness I was expecting. It just... wasn't there. Plenty of noodles and they were cooked right. But it just didn't have the flavor I was hoping to have.

I'd recommend trying something else. Unless non-spicy is your thing, in which case, noodle on!"}
{"text":"I used to go here to only have the spicy japanese noodles... they are the best.. the other dishes are mediocre..also one of the few places where you get a cotton candy"}
{"text":"Om nom nom nom Noodles!!

I need to go here again, why doesn't my boyfriend like Italian!?! Is it the lack of meat? Por Que!!!??

Anywho-
I love noodles and went here with a friend who had a coupon from one of those giant books. Basically it's set up like a Panera, or American Roadside, you order, sit down with your number, they bring it to you.

They have a good variety including Asian, America, Italian,soups, salads, and a kids menu.

Our Order:

Stuffed Shells
Oven-baked pasta shells overflowing with slightly sweet Ricotta cheese and spinach, smothered in a tomato cream sauce topped with Mozzarella and fresh basil.

Lobster Ravioli
Ravioli stuffed with lobster meat, sweet Ricotta cheese and shallots.  Baked under a slightly sweet and spicy chipotle cream sauce topped with Mozzarella.  Finished with scallions.

I had the Lobster Ravioli, and OMG delicious, move over Olive Garden I'm going cheap tonight! Super delicious, and very filling. The food here is good...I need to go back for a good carb kick. The bread sticks are good too, and you can buy 5 extra or so for $1.00..which I did cause I love bread, and noodles - but do they love me? My butt says probably not. 

Anyway - try it out, see if you like it, try one of the above items both yummy. Then Yelp it out loud!"}
{"text":"Fast past dishes.i got some angel hair with balsamic sauce is good. Also their offer King pops"}
{"text":"I was not impressed with this place much.  It is nice that they offer tofu as an alternative to meat for add-on's in your noodles.  However, vegetarians beware: they cook on the same surfaces, and the tofu took 10 minutes longer to arrive than my other friends' chicken dishes.  The specials have decent prices, when you do a combo.  Otherwise, I think this place is over-priced and avoidable."}
{"text":"For some time now since i been living in the area i have been seeing this place and was always tempted to go but i knew  i had no intrest of nothing but noodles because i needed some kind of meat. Low and behold to my suprise you can add any meats and vegetables to the different types of noodles they serve. I had the pomodoro pasta and added chicken to mines.Nothing spactacular or to rave about but i would go back to try out other dishes.I myself was probly more in love with the breadstick than the actual dish. I also had the salted carmel cookie which i am a fan of the cookie maybe next time ill try one of the others they offer."}
{"text":"Talk about mouth watering oodles and noodles. The noodle dishes are the best! I ordered the shrimp scampi noodles. My food was so fresh and hot when it came out as well as my bread stick that the noodles came with. Nothing but noodles is located in a shopping center just a small sit down casual spot but don't be fooled because i almost felt like i was sitting down at a fancy restaurant as good as my food was! You may find me posted at Nothing but Noodles on the regular they have a repeat customer for life for sure."}
{"text":"This was my husband and I's first time coming to this restaurant.  At first we were excited about their pad Thai, but once we got to the register and were NOT greeted, we quickly wondered if it was a good choice to have come or not... We ordered. Were given our glasses and went to sit down.  As soon as I was about half way through my drink I noticed there was lipstick on my glass.  My husband took it up to the front to show them and get a different glass.  No apology, no nothing.  Just took the glass and gave him a new one.  The service here sucks, and I hate to say it, but it might be due to their staff which is all teenagers.  I wish young people had more respect for others.  

Needless to say we will not be eating here again.  

Oh, I gave them one start because their pad Thai was pretty good.  Not a lot of seasoning, but not too bad."}
