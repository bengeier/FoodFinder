{"text":"I visited this location around 430pm on Sunday.

The young lady working at the cash was rude and unhelpful. 

She spoke in a very low voice and would get annoyed when we asked her to repeat herself. 

Would not go back due to unsatisfactory customer service.

The burger was good but we couldn't enjoy it because of the poor attitude."}
{"text":"Downgrading because the last two visits, I've received my burger with incorrect toppings.
Usually missing important toppings I've asked and paid for, which of course you don't find out until you've gotten home. Now I'm hesitant to go as their service has gotten sloppy."}
{"text":"This Hero Burger location is terrible. They post their hours but are not open when they say. They close randomly and decide to leave early. One time I went there an hour before closing time and they had shut down and cleaned their fryer, cleaned and put their stools on top of the tables. As I walked in they made a face and begrudgingly served me. They told me fries and onion rings were not available. Ridiculous. Don't go to this location"}
{"text":"The food was great! The lady in the front serving customers very polite and helpful... there was quite a few customers the place was busy, and I got my food at a reasonable time. I recommend this location to my family and friends.."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday evening during dinner time around 7pm. There were no customers that as we pulled up and parked the car, we noticed the two female staff members just sitting and talking in the dining area. I guess they realized we were coming in since one girl walked to the cash and the other girl hurried to the kitchen. 

My boyfriend and I originally decided to come here since I had coupons. I was craving chicken strips that night and there was a coupon for chicken strips, so why not? My boyfriend ordered the egg burger. I wanted the chicken strips as mentioned, but unfortunately, they said they they didn't have them available for that day...weird (since I also read that some other people complained on this Yelp page that their preferred items were \"not available\"). Anyways, I just ended up getting the crispy chicken sandwich. Total came to about $25 for one combo and a sandwich.

We chose to dine in. When our food was ready, the cashier girl walked over to bring our food and told us which was which and picked them off the tray and laid it infront of us. I was pretty happy with my food. No complaints on my end. My boyfriend, on the other hand, wasn't too happy with his order. The peameal bacon was over cooked/kind of burnt, the egg was over cooked as it wasn't runny (kind of like an over hard cook), and there were some requested condiments missing (but was put onto the order as I double checked the receipt). 

Ontop of the disappointment of the food, the place was really dirty. There was a table where we wanted to sit but both the table and chairs were dirty so we looked for a different spot. Another 2 customers after us wanted to sit there too, but again, it was too dirty. The whole place was a mess to be quite honest. Not sure why they were just sitting around when we first arrived when the place could be cleaned. Crumbs and oil on top of tables, crumbs and food bits/chunks on the chairs and ground, plastic forks and cup lids laying on the carpet near the front door (will post picture). The staff didn't seem to friendly or happy either, especially when they both disappeared somewhere in the kitchen, no where to be found as us customers were dining. 

I probably won't be back to this location, especially with my boyfriend as he was so disappointed by this location. In his words \"it's not like it's even busy that you forgot about my food\" when we were the only ones at one point. I'm not sure if management or the franchise owner just doesn't care about the business anymore or if they have changed throughout the years, but this place has gone downhill in customer satisfaction since they opened awhile back."}
{"text":"If price isn't an issue, Hero would be my number 1 choice. This place is small but clean. Service is very good and love the pop machine with unlimited refills and choices."}
{"text":"The salmon fillet itself was quite tender though but on the bland side. The Low-Fat Mayonnaise or Pineapple Mango would have been better complements.

On the other hand, the condiments picked for the 4 oz Hero Burger were perfect. The juicy sliced pickles, fresh lettuce and tomatoes, ketchup, relish, mustard went so well with the beef patty. This batch of jalape√±os happened to be very spicy so it definitely gave the burger a kick of flavour.

I still preferred the hamburger over the salmon burger this time."}
{"text":"Been to a couple of hero burgers locations and it all seems to taste different from location to location"}
{"text":"Okay, first and foremost, I think they were logged into Yelp as well since I heard them speaking about reviews someone else wrote. I will be a little nit-picky as a result.

So I came here for lunch since they are around the corner from work. It's a small hero burger, but nice inside. Few crumbs on the tables (nit pick! muhahahahah)

I ordered a 6oz burger, with fries and a coke. The cashier was nice and took my order. I got coke and it was a bit flat (nit-pick). 

The cashier brought my food over to me, which was pretty awesome as I didn't expect it. The fries were scrumptious, and the burger was good, little dry (nit) but good (pick).

I like hero burger, but if you know me, I like anything \"hero\". Price is standard for a decent burger place, so I would recommend."}
{"text":"Just finished getting my nails done next door and noticed The ''blue moon' burger that had my name all over it.  Place was empty on a Friday of a long weekend, so not surprised it was empty. Friendly gal at cash, and I try (again, looking for good onion rings), order them well done.  The rings were just ok. Next time I'll try fries or poutine. The burger was yum! Juicy burger, fresh lettuce, tomato (see later), and mushrooms.  I decided not to sauce it up since it already had blue cheese (not even ketchup, new one for me). I don't mind waiting a few extra minutes for a FRESHLY cooked burger, I like the whole quality and raising of beef, etc - the 'social culture' I guess you could say... and for me, this alone, I don't mind paying a bit extra.  
What is the deal with complaints about condiment confusion? Is it that hard to read a menu? Don't you like the idea of choosing what you want?  
It costs more than the 'drive through' (any of them), but I will make Hero my choice over them any day.
My one beef (sorry, I had to :)) - is the tomato slice was so thin I didn't know it was there, I'll order extra next time (tomato is free topping) and a dab of mayo to mello out the blue cheese a tad.

**Manager/head Office - have specials like the blue moon on your website! Pls"}
