{"text":"Papa's in the house! I'm surprised to see a location pop up in Toronto because I always loved getting a bite when I traveled to the states. :)

The here is insanely fast and the quality of the pizza is much better than other chains like Pizza Pizza or Domino's."}
{"text":"I order a pizza online 10th March 2015 around 730 pm. On the website I did not see where you can remove certain topping on the website, I am allergy to onions so when I bit into the pizza I realize it had onions on the pizza. My girlfriend was eating the pizza so she didn't realize it so she eat a couple of slices before I had even ate a slice so when I took a bite I could taste the onions I called the store and explain my situation and the manager told me to just pull off the onions on my pizza. I felt like that was so disrespectful to tell a customers who is allergy to onions to just pull it off I ordered a hawaiian barbecue  chicken pizza. Instead of just sending one out to handle the situation I lost 23.59 to a company claims to have the number rating when it comes to Papa John Pizza. I order Papa John a lot this has caused me to think twice about Papa John. I feel she was not worrying about her customer satisfaction all I wanted was a Hawaiian Barbecue Chicken Pizza without onions. Thank you for listen to my concern I talk to a guy name Beck who referred me to the manager she needs more training on handling customers order I could've  being in the hospital if I just pick the onions off they are cut in little pieces please let me know if this can be settle thank you Papa John.."}
{"text":"We ordered pizza for delivery and were quoted 30 minutes to 1 hour to deliver it.  No problem there, but it took over 1 hour 30 minutes to arrive.  When we called to see what the delay was, they told us there was no order for our name or address.  The pizza finally did show up, but one pizza was for someone with an allergy to dairy and there was a huge chunk of cheese right in the middle.  Will not order from here again."}
{"text":"Have ordered pizza from here several times.  It's good.  Tasty. No complaints. Courteous staff.  Calgary South Health Campus nearby."}
{"text":"We order delivery from here often using the online site.  The service is pretty good, gets delivered in a reasonable time frame. We definitely wish there were were more veggie toppings available. The meat options are pretty wide though. Unlike some other brands, papa John's is not overly greasy which is a plus. 

One down side is that some ingredients that release water, like tomato and mushrooms are placed under the cheese which we find can make the crust a little soggier. The dipping sauces are also a hit or miss. Each pizza comes with the garlic sauce with is litterally just garlic flavoured oil. The blue cheese dip doesn't taste sufficiently like blue cheese, Buffalo sauce and honey mustard are alright but more suitable for wings, that leaves their tomato sauce is good and I wish that was the default.

Nevertheless, prices are good and this is a good option for a night when you are too tired to cook."}
{"text":"Friday night...thought we'd try a new Pizza Place for the family.
Ordered 2 pizzas on line...easy enough.
Received a confirmation email saying that it would be delivered in 55-65 minutes (we live 10-15 minutes away) fair enough.
After waiting 1 1/2 hours, I call the Customer Service line and it was stated that it would be there in 20 minutes or so.
So after 1 3/4 hours the pizza finally arrives. The driver begins to tell me that he was late because of the Roads and the bad weather...ok it snowed on Sunday and Monday...so the roads are considerable better than they have been.
When the driver gives me the pizza, they are STONE COLD! The driver knew that we'd probably be upset with the cold pizza because as SOON as we mentioned that the pizzas were cold, he said they were free of charge. Out of principal, we refused the free pizzas.
I called the Customer Care Center again to let them know of my experience (the people at the call center were wonderful) and received a call from the owner a short time later.
He explained to me that I should have expected a long time for the delivery as it is his busiest night.
Instead of listening to me (the customer) he continued to tell me that I need to be much more understanding...I mentioned had he or the driver given us a courtesy call that the pizza was delayed...I would have been ok with that..however being told that it is my fault that they are busier on a Friday...ummm no"}
{"text":"This is the worst place to order from ,you get burnt pizza and bad attitudes and poor customer service at best I wish I could give them less than one star. By the way I got no replacement pizza"}
{"text":"I used the app to order my pizzas. The wait time 31-45 minutes.I called the store. I was put on hold for 7 minutes. I called back explained that I was on hold & nobody returned. No acknowledgement that happened. The man on the phone just confirmed my name & delivery address & explained that my pizza was out for delivery along with 2 other orders. I said it's been just over an hour & the wait time was 45. Did he know where in the delivery order I landed or if I could pick up my pizzas? He said he couldn't do either. Just didn't speak after letting me know the system doesn't reflect true delivery times. That they were an hour to hour & 30 right now. Absolutely no customer service what so ever. Super disappointed."}
{"text":"My husband and I had our first Papa John's pizza a few weeks ago. We got delivery and it seemed like an unusually long wait time. Recently, I ordered on the app for pick up. I now understand the long wait time. My pizza was ready for me, but there seemed to be about 10-15 pizzas ready to be delivered and picked up! The one thing that bothered me was when I walked in, there were about 8 employees all working; they looked at me but no one greeted or came over to help me...not the best customer service. We enjoy the pizza though."}
{"text":"Good pizza but delivery and customer service sucks.
-1st order, went to St George st even though order said St Mary st with proper postal code. Driver called for directions and made it eventually... Pizza lost heat but was good.
-2nd order, arrived on time but drivers payment terminal had a low battery. Had to borrow money from the co-worker I was supposed to be treating to lunch.
-3rd order, scheduled a delivery time to coincide with the lunch hour. Driver arrived 40 minutes early so pizza would be cold by lunch break. 
Was told they would prepare a new order and deliver again. Are you sure it will be a new order? Yes. 
How do I know you won't serve me the same pizzas? We will throw them out. 
Why not give them away then? Sorry can't do that.
Needless to say I cancelled the order outright. 
Sorry Papa John's Dundas st... If you can't take care of the simple stuff and fail to follow up with complaints... How can we be certain everthing else is as claimed?
3 strikes and your out!"}
{"text":"LOVE Papa Johns so I was excited to have them move into our neighborhood!  When I picked up my pizza it looked smaller than normal and I asked the guy who was super super nice about it and he wasn't too sure because he was training. I had a coupon so I really can't complain but they shorted me an inch all around . Even tho they shorted me this time I'll still come back."}
{"text":"Honestly I didn't even know we had gotten a Papa Johns up here and like the person I am figured I'd have to give them a try. So I call up, place an order and when it was time go down to pick it up. Sorry, I'm not paying for delivery.

I get the pizza and it looks decent just about the same as any other chain's pizza. Take a bite and I'm profoundly disappointed. The tomato sauce tasted sweet. I mean sugar sweet. I get it that the best tomatoes out there are sweet but you shouldn't feel like sugar was added to the sauce. The cheese was also strangely tasteless. It had that bite that good mozzarella has but it lacked flavor. The veggies were good and the pepperoni was okay I guess but all in all it was a disappointing pizza.

Sorry Papa Johns, I'll continue to order my pizza from the Mom & Pop Italian place down the street."}
{"text":"I cant pinpoint what I dont like about their pizza, Im not sure if this location or if Papa John in general. I have never had Papa John and there a very few north of the border, I think other is in bloor west village.

It probably the sause or dough. It not undercooked but something with combo doesnt make it taste that good.... There garlic dipping sauce look like a liquid mustard, i though it was honey mustard but yeh it not, I couldnt finish the food, I tried so I dont waste but I manage to get only a few slices in. It rare to see me not finish food but couldn't.  I  would been better off going to pizza pizza, I though Papa John was more upscale pizza but I was wrong

The cookie is the saving grace kind of, it was good which is only reason I dont give them 1"}
{"text":"Since my last critique of this establishment, I'm pleased to acknowledge much improvement. In one instance I was dissatisfied with my order, and indicated such in the follow-on email, Papa Johns sends after each order.
I received a response back, promptly! The individual asked for my specific issue(s) and responded positively. He even gave me a credit on my order. The subsequent pie was what I had originally ordered.
The staffing has been consistent lately too, which is a good thing. I usually visit 1-2 monthly.
The pie here is not the best I've ever had, but it is the best in the area - especially notable since this is a franchise too. Stay away from the pizza joint across the street - they have no idea what an Italian pie is all about."}
{"text":"I always order from here because it's close to my work. I love it! The food is delicious every time and I never have to wait. It is always ready by the time I get there."}
{"text":"Ordered online. Pizza was cold and burnt. Customer service was horrible. Basically told me it was cold because I ordered online."}
{"text":"I went to PAPA's in Myrtle Beach on Monday the 16th of April.
After showing an email that PAPA's sent to me, 2 large 2 toppings pizzas for $16, the girl said I must go home and ORDER ONLINE!
My phone showed Promo code 82LG, but my dumb phone would not let me order. I asked again if they would give me the price, ANOTHER NO. 
So we went to Domino's, Paid $20 for 2 large pies and ate.
No customer service has me staying away from PAPA's forever!"}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty good,  I'd say almost as good as pizza hut(even though Pizza hut is greasy as f,  they still the best out there in terms of franchise)  
Papa John's was a bit more on the saucy side,  personally too much sauce for my liking,  I would have rathered more cheese,  but still better than most.  They serve with a garlic sauce which is really ODD rather than tasy,  practically just melted butter in a container.  Overall pizza is good lol."}
{"text":"I wanted to like Papa John's & had been waiting for an opportune time to finally try it. I was very disappointed. 

Papa John's is BETTER than- Little Caesars, Dominos & Pizza Hut- but that says very little, as they are all really bad pizzas.

Papa John's is worse than PizzaPizza- but that's far from an endorsement, as PizzaPizza is also far from good pizza.

I ordered a large, regular crust & sauce sausage pizza with onions, mushrooms (1/2 pizza), green pepper (1/2 pizza) & extra cheese for pick-up on a mid week evening around 6:15PM. Pizza was ready when I arrived & was as ordered. Pizza was also nice & hot.

My wife & I were able to eat a couple of slices each & I even had a cold slice the next morning. But we ate only because we were hungry. Their sauce is sweet- much too sweet. The crust tasted of nothing. Cheese was also tasteless. Vegetable toppings were fine & generous. Sausage was just so-so, but was also generously spread on the pizza.

If I had to eat a PapaJohn pizza ever again I would try their thin crust. PERHAPS that would make it somewhat better."}
{"text":"It is not a pizza at all. It literally a huge bread dough with some sauce on it. And it burnt. Don't recommend this location at all."}
{"text":"Great cheese and quick service. It is good if you are craving cheap pizza

You can get a personal (small pizza) for $5."}
{"text":"Really disappointed with the pizza, I have had PJ pizza from Dundas location and it is usually on point, looks similar to menu. This pizza looks nothing like what I ordered. The topping are very light, the crust is huge. The dough seems that it did not rise properly, as it was like a thin crust pizza. I wish I had the time to have them remake it but I did not, they should really not serve something like this. I won't be back and sadly cannot recommend this location. What makes this worse, it was my cheat night , and this is what I cheated on !!!! Beyond disappointed ! I've attached a picture of what the pizza should have looked like ...."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Placed an order for a large pizza. They delivered a small pizza instead. We called them to have it rectified. They offered coupons which we would have to come to the store to pick up. We were moving out of country in 3 days so asked for a refund instead for the inconvenience. They said we would have to bring the pizza and drive 20 mins to the store to prove to them it was a small. I told them this is terrible customer service and the guy said yeah well I guess you're just going to have to write a google review aren't you and hung up. Terrible pizza and service!!"}
{"text":"Never have I had such bad coustomer service.Got heartshaped pizza spical with brownie got charged full price for something that should of been discounted on feb 14 so not only was it way over priced it was hard and burnt they told me I would get my money back on my card never did you are better off eating a frozen pizza cause this store sucks."}
{"text":"Call on 12/31/17 at 9:28pm to place an order for (1) large pizza. On the first call, the guy answered \"thank you for calling Dominos...I mean, Papa Johns.\" He then asked if he could place me on hold. I said ok. I was on hold for literally 5 minutes before hanging up and calling back. Same guy answered and just said he needed to put me on hold. I waited another 4 minutes before hanging up and trying back. The third time I called, he just picked up and put me on hold. I hung up and tried again because I wanted to see what the heck was going on at this point. He left the phone off the hook. 

I live about 4 minutes away, so I just drove down there. I parked in front and there was no one inside. A saw a delivery driver leave and, at this point, it was about 10pm. Before I could get to the door, someone locked it and turned the \"open\" sign off. I went to the door and a guy in the back saw me, frowned and turned his back to me. 

Unbelievable. If this is what we have to look forward to from our new neighborhood pizza establishment, then I'll just go back to my older options. So disappointed! I've included screen shots of the calls I made so you can see that this is 100% true..."}
{"text":"Wow, I was blown away by the quality and taste of the pizza I ordered from this Papa John's! I have tried so many of their competitors and always ended up disappointed, but I think I just found my goto pizza restaurant in downtown Toronto! I got an excellent deal for a large pizza with 3 toppings (less than $10). The delivery was prompt, the pizza was hot and all the ingredients tasted wonderfully fresh. To top it off they give you a complimentary dipping sauce with each order. I would return here in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"-0 Worst Customer Service, After an Hour Of Waiting, I called an Some Idiot Answer Stating Pizza Had Just Left And Might Be another 35 Minutes. This is Why Places Like Little Ceasers Are Taking Their Business. Rather Spent 5 Minutes Driving Over Waiting For 1 1/2 Hour Just To Deal With Rude Idiots With No Customer Service at All. My 3rd Time Ordering From Here. Last Time They Brought the Wrong Order and When Finally Arrived it was Cold."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 large pizza. Staff girl assisted 2customer handling paper money turned around and started handling dough without washing her hands. I asked for manager and supervisor this girl on the red shirt loudly said : WHAT? With a big attitude sassy girl."}
{"text":"Will never go to this papa John's again I was sitting waiting for my pizza just looking around and the young girl in there thought I was staring at her and said to a coworker I don't know why the f$&@ she keeps staring at me and I was not even staring at her and when I told the manager what was said she acted like she didn't give a crap. They were not even in uniform all wore street clothes. I did not argue I just called corporate when I left store. Never again will I patronize this location. Warrensville and Libby maple hts whatever happened to professionalism"}
{"text":"Incredible frustrating experience from this pizza place. they were late around 2 hours of delivering my pizza and when it arrived..I didnt want it no more. I was forced to pay for a pizza that is cold and disgusting while I paid for delivery. completely ridiculous!!!"}

{"text":"I never had Papa John's pizza before. I placed my order online which I love that it gives the option of well done for the pizza there's nothing more disappointing than a soggy pizza. I always see commercials saying better ingredients... And it sure did seem so. The pizza was hot upon arrival and I really liked the garlic sauce, it kicks it up a notch. Ordered the cookie as well nice and hot.. Everything tasted fresh. Delivery was quick, the order process was easy... I'd definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"I went to Papa Johns restaurant since there was a 40 percent off special though the Papa Johns app and ordered two large takeout pizzas. I ordered the Ultimate Meats pizza and the Philly Cheesesteak Pizza . Both pizzas were delicious and my family enjoyed them.

We have been coming to this location for a long time because their pizzas are normally better than the Pizza Pizza, Dominos and other pizza chains in the area. Customer service can be uneven at times, but we never have to wait long for our pizzas."}
{"text":"Solid pizza for a reasonable price. HATE the neighborhood though, I feel like I'm gonna get shanked after dark around there."}
{"text":"Ok, so I stupidly went back.

I wanted to get a walk-in special for lunch. They offer a large, specialty pizza for $16.99 on their menu board.  I ask for that politely and I specify the type of pizza which I am reading directly from their menu board.   They guy gives me a total of $22.59, which is $3 more than the menu board.

I point this out to him. He is clearly incapable of explaining himself or problem solving. 
He attempts to tell me the special on the board includes pop and isn't the same one I think it is.
I say, great, you're telling me that for $16.99 + tax, I can get the pizza and some pops. 
He doesn't understand and I ask if he can look at the menu board to understand what I'm seeing. He insists that the specific pizza I want isn't part of that $16.99 deal. I can see it very clearly listed 3rd on the list.

I tell him to keep his pizza and that I won't be taken for a ride. 

To heck with this place!"}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmm, Papa John's. I order here at least once a week. It's close by other chain pizza places but honestly the quality of the pizza is so much better. You don't feel bloated afterwards. They are also not cheap with the toppings. It's just under the cheesy goodness. They are fast and the pizza and wings are to die for."}
{"text":"Everybody on here complaining... different strokes for different folks. Never had an issue with this Papa Johns. Only thing is, I wish their online carry out deals counted for delivery... but doesn't everyone? 

Called, had to hold, gentlemen on the phone \"Isaac\" very nice, communicated very well. I was on hold for a minute maybe. He took my order and was having issues with the system.. so after about a minute of frustration, he let me know he was switching to a different computer and reentering my order. (I've been in the food and beverage industry for 6 years now) I feel that he had very good customer service. My order arrived quicker than estimated.. I'm eating it now, it's delicious. AND HOT. I don't know, everyone has different experiences, but I've never had a bad one. Whether I order for delivery or go in and grab one, every person I've dealt with has been friendly. 

Can we talk about this pizza tho...."}
{"text":"We order pizza from here often and have never had an issue!  The pizzas are always tasty, served hot, and they typically have a good promotion as well."}
{"text":"This is the closest store to us, but are told we have to order from a store 3 times farther away.  We tried but received a luke warm pizza. Motto seems to have changed to \"better ingredients... Cold pizza\" It is chain pizza so is pretty much a fast food all the same choice. Will continue to just go to Pizza Hut as the customer service is just so much better

Pizza Hut's system did not recognize our address when the updated their database to order delivery online. They did not send us to another store 3 times away, but gave me his name to talk to personally to order delivery as well as a note if not there.  That is customer service Papa John's maybe you should take note."}
{"text":"Crust is a little thin and the topping selection is a little limited. But they are very quick on delivery and always toss in some dipping sauce."}
