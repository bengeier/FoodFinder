{"text":"I went to Plein Sud twice during the last month which might give you an idea about how much I liked it the first time I went there. It's situated in the Plateau-Mont Royal neighborhood, at a walking distance from the Mont Royal metro station.   Their Table d'hote for lunch comprises of a soup/salad, a main dish and a dessert. I opted for the cold soup which was excellent. It was more like a vegetable smoothie (albeit less viscous) than a soup but excellent nonetheless. The Onglet de Boeuf that I ordered was done to perfection and the petit choux dessert was very good as well.  We liked their cooking so much that we decided to go there once more to check out their famous Magret de Canard. They had cooked it in a Fig sauce with a gratin and a salad on the side. It was exceptionally good. The dinner Table d'hote doesn't have a dessert included, so you'll have to pay extra for if you need any. We opted for the crème brulée and found to our liking.  The dinner can hit your pocket hard if you add wine and dessert to your meal and you might end up paying approximately $50/person. But this isn't meant to be a criticism, it's only a heads-up to fellow Yelpers.   All in all a very good experience. I'd recommend this restaurant to my friends/family.  Table d'hote lunch: $15-18 Table d'hote dinner: $25-30"}
{"text":"Everything on the menu looked good.The waiter explained everything and was smilling during the entire service. honnestly the staff was really friendly and never looked bothered to repeat or explain. The food was really good and the dessert was awesome (chocolate and marshmallow fondant). I highly recommand this restaurant."}
{"text":"Ah you French ! You make such delicious food! Unparalleled greatly price gastronomy! Hidden gem on the Plateau. Look no further and enjoy! Quiet little restaurant. Quality is unmatched. Table d'hote is always a favourite. Vive la France!"}
{"text":"Belle découverte , beau menu pour le le dîner ,nous avons choisi l'onglet de boeuf  qui était excellent. Service courtois ,je le conseille vivement."}
{"text":"En mai 2013 , je suis allée chez Plein-Sud avec des amies pour le repas du midi .Tout est agréable : la bouffe (onglet de boeuf à recommander pour les carnivores ) , le service ( absolument charmant ) ,le décor (très bistro ) et les prix raisonnables tant pour le menu que pour les vins .Je me promets d'y retourner à la prochaine occasion !"}
{"text":"Great restaurant! The staff is really nice and the ambiance as well! The meals are very generous, so be sure you'll like what you order. Everything was delicious when we went and we'll obviously go back."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant de cuisine française, du Sud de la France donc, sur le Plateau pour des prix abordables, dans un cadre charmant et convivial, avec un service irréprochable. Je vous conseille l'onglet, un vrai délice!"}
{"text":"Cozy setting with a solid menu of crowd-pleasing French dishes. I had the lamb (a specialty of the house), and it was perfect, juicy, falling off the bone, accompanied by a sweet potato purée, lentils and haricots verts. My husband had steak and frites.   When we visited, the proprietor was also the only bartender and server, and he managed to do it very well, with friendliness and efficiency. Would highly recommend for those looking for a delicious, if not necessarily innovative, meal and good service."}
{"text":"I went a third time to this restaurant with friends from out of town and was so happy! I love it here! MUST GO! for everyone. Highly underrated!  I had the duck magret with cranberry sauce, it was exceptional!"}
{"text":"Amazing service from beginning to end. They did a great job translating the Special 3 course menu. The food was beautifully presented and tasted delicious. I will definitely visit again!! Merci beaucoup!"}
{"text":"There are so many placed in Montreal it is hard to pick. This is out of the main tourist area, and worth the trip.  As others have said, the Lamb Shank (one of the two specialties of the house) is fantastic. Not a ton to eat, so don't be scared to order it. Beautifully flavored and prepared. Served with some nice vegetables.  My wife had the veal stew with gnocchi. I am not sure which dish was better! Great flavor and perfectly cooked gnocchi.  When we walked in, we were the only ones there, so were a bit nervous. But not to worry, it was great. Just one waiter and a sort of waitress/bar maid. Maybe even the owners? The man made great suggestions on what to order. The Corsican beer was also good."}
{"text":"We had the leg of lamb and the pork with rosemary. Both were mediocre - not particularly moist. We enjoyed the sides more than the mains - both came with sweet potato puree, some vegetables, and lentils. The pork came w/ some limp sweet potato fries. Service was poor. Our waiter disappeared after taking our order to handle another section. We had to request that they bring the complimentary bread, and flag down some other waiter to request the bill. No water refill until we paid the check. We had some leftovers and requested that it be boxed up, but only the main dish was boxed; a nice piece of pork was discarded."}
{"text":"Update time! I recently returned for a loved one's birthday and we will definitely be returning!  I was very much impressed with the service. The hosts were friendly and casual yet professional. The menu was explained to us, the wine was brought, and we were given lots of time to discuss.   The food! Fancy yet homey. I had the hanger steak with blue cheese sauce and it was fantastic! Small pieces of steak bathed in a mild blue cheese sauce with a bowl of fries. The other stand out meal was the fish of the day, on that day cod in a mild curry sauce with a mix of veggies. The duck breast was nothing out of the ordinary, but deliciously tender nonetheless.   Pleun Sud has a nice selection of private import wine, at reasonable prices. We ordered both a white and a red, and were very satisfied with both.   Eating at Pkein Sud is a great experience. If you want to go out for a fun special occasion dinner, with delicious French food without the formalness and pretentiousness occasionally found in French restaurants, this is the place."}
{"text":"Generally speaking it's worth a second time visit. The owner was so nice, explaining the menu to us in English when he noticed that we don't speak French. I ordered a veal pasta and it was good. The salad was plain though. The after-meal dessert was a bit too moisture that made the texture went loose."}
{"text":"Awesome! A very nice date spot, classy and comfortable. Staff was excellent. My date and I both had the steak, which was as good as it gets."}
{"text":"J'y suis allé en 2013 pour Montréal à table, c'était très bon! La déco est sympa, le service est très bon, un bon petit resto dans le coin!"}
{"text":"We had a great time here. The gnocchi with veal was excellent. The meat was tender and the sauce was delicious. The Colomba beer was recommended to us and was quite good. Surprisingly few people were in the restaurant for some reason. The staff were all French (I think) and friendly. Recommended!"}
{"text":"Plein Sud c'est un peu l'exemple typique de l'intégration de Français au Québec qui ont su tiré parti du meilleur des deux cultures. Ce charmant couple de gens du sud proposent un menu original car composé de plats de chez eux mais accommodés avec des ingrédients d'ici. Vous voulez un exemple? Alors goûtez leur magret à la sauce canneberge! Le reste de la carte sera à cette même image : coloré, original et savoureux. Les assiettes sont bien remplies, le service est très bon, le rapport qualité prix très bon. Enfin, l'ambiance est très sympa. Bref, quoi dire de plus quand il n'y a rien à redire?"}
{"text":"A hesitant 4 stars.  A very nice place with lots of potential.  Not busy when I was there for mid-week dinner.  Family run it seems.  I hesitate to give this 4 stars because I kind of felt that the entree was just not 'great'.  Good simple food but the jus tasted canned and the frites were okay only.  Service was great.  Would go back again.  Maybe not tomorrow though."}
{"text":"La Corse s'invite au Québec et elle le fait très bien!  Une carte de très bons plats de l'île et quelques classiques. On peut agrémenter le tout de l'inévitable Pietra et d'une sélection de vins.  Accueil chaleureux, terrasse très sympathique l'été et décor chic et simple comme on aime.  Poire belle Hélène et Pascal Paoli au menu du dessert."}
{"text":"SO GOOD! And not only was it good, it was very reasonably priced. Our waiter was kind, attentive, and funny. He was also taking care of a large group (I assume a birthday celebration, but my French is too rusty to know for sure!) and he seemed very personable with them, too.  My companion and I did not have drinks, but we each had an entree (the Duck and the Lamb Shank) and a dessert (Creme brulee). The dishes were beautifully plated and focused heavily on the meat; it was in the center of the dish and the \"side dishes\" were very small and surrounded the meat. They served their purpose of enhancing my lamb, and I wouldn't have really wanted more to eat. Both meats were tender and flavorful - the duck came with mushrooms and a brown sauce that worked really well together. I was so excited when my dinner came that I forgot to take a picture!  The desserts were modest, but tasty. I was less impressed with them (compared to our dinner, but that's going to be difficult to counter!).   All in, we spent less than $100CAD and it was worth every penny."}
{"text":"First time visiting Montréal, and staying in the neighborhood - I am so glad to have found Plein Sud nearby on Yelp. After a long travel day, our group loved the laid back vibes of this small, chic wine bar. With wines and foods inspired by the south (\"sud\") of France, we were excited to try a variety of tapas plates. Nothing disappointed. Armed with a full bottle of Syrah to share, we dove into the stuffed calamari, pesto gnocchi, meat and cheese plate, and speciality toast. Unflinchingly, my friend declared that calamari to be the best squid she has every had. I could say the same about the gnocchi... I ate them so slowly because I never wanted them to end! The variety of meats and cheeses were, of course, also delicious. And the seasonal special was a nut/raisin bread with prosciutto, cheese, and strawberries. The quality of food and wine for what was only $35 (CAD) each is absurd. Needless to say, we are so thankful to have stayed close by so that we were able to find Plein Sud!"}
{"text":"Excellent service --- the gentleman who greeted us when we walked in and explained the menu to us was extremely enthusiastic and loved what he was doing.  Service was attentive; no complaints.  The atmosphere was relaxed, great vibe.  Good wine.  We ordered: lamb shank: this was the favorite: Very tender, the meat melts in your mouth in a \"can i have more please?\" way duck margaret with cranberry sauce: very tasty, very good veal and pasta: reminded me a little of stroganof, also very good but hard to match up against the lamb shank steak and french fries: also good  The soup was zucchini soup which was fine.  Pepper gives it added flavor, but it comes with a light spice on its own. The salad was good, sprinkled with a light vinegrette; preferred it over the soup.  All in all a great experience."}
{"text":"Came here for a lunch because of the great Yelp reviews. The service was exceptionally well. We ordered both the salad and the soup. The soup was too salty and the owner gladly exchanged it to a salad.  I got the medium rare beef and my bf got the veal pasta. My beef wasn't very flavourful and the fries was ok. I personally prefer crispy ones. My bf's veal was a little tough to chew, but the sauce was a great company to the pasta. The dessert was a small piece of pear cake, dense, moist and tasty.  Overall, this ain't a restaurant that I would visit again, but the lunch was only $20/person. It was a good deal."}
{"text":"I just finished diner here and couldn't wait to write this review.  Its a mom and pop shop and was fortunate enough to meet the family and chat for a bit about their home in southern France.  They were very warm and suggestive and the food was amazing."}
{"text":"Stop here and eat. Don't hesitate. What a delightful waiter with a charming smile and dancing eyes!  We all cleaned our plates. My lamb shank was one of the best I have eaten with the meat falling off the bone.   My family also ate the duck breast, the fettuccini w coppa and pork. And don't forget the dessert profiteroles: 2 small ones that were just the right size.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Montréal hidden jem. This place is an awesome place if you are looking for French dishes in reasonable price. Good menu selection. The duck breast was AMAZING. Love it!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Decent service. Servers were very warm and friendly. Very reasonable prices. Good, solid French cuisine."}
{"text":"J'y suis allé dans le cadre d'un souper-conférence avec mes collègues. Nous avions une section à nous pour l'évènement. On s'est très bien occupé de nous. On sent que la restauration c'est une passion. J'ai adoré la nourriture et le menu. Le service était excellent. Mes collègues ont aussi adoré. Je vais certainement y retourner.  Beau petit restaurant."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best dining experience I had on my recent trip to Montreal. Proper, unpretentious French food with exceptional service.  Everything is prepared well and plated to perfection. The veal, the gnocchi, the risotto, the ratatouille... I don't have a single complaint except that I wished I was in Montreal for longer."}
{"text":"Un des meilleurs restaurants français de Montréal. Les plats sont tous délicieux. La cuisine est faite avec des aliments de qualité. Les patrons sont vraiment gentils, ils seront là pour répondre à toutes vos questions :) Je garde un très bon souvenir de toutes mes visites !"}
{"text":"Cute little family-run restaurant! The staff was super friendly, and the food was great and reasonably priced!  I had the veal with gnocchi - and it was so nice I almost cried. The perfect comfort food on a rainy night in Montreal. The menu did not have any vegetarian options, but the kitchen made a delicious meat-free pasta dish for my friend. Although we were quite full, we decided to try their profiteroles for dessert. Yummy!   We will be back!"}
{"text":"You'll feel like you're in a quaint French town as soon as you walk in.  You'll be greeted by incredibly nice staff as soon as you enter. Service is quick, the food is tasty and the atmosphere is very cozy and romantic with the background music. I'm not the biggest lamb fan in the world, but the lamb shank here was as good as I've ever had. The meat melted right off and was tender and tasty.  One minor criticism was that the parfait dessert I had was quite hard. I'm not sure if it's supposed to be like that, I was expecting something a bit softer. It was difficult to eat with a spoon but it still tasted quite nice."}
{"text":"On a dîné là avec mon petit ami récemment, et on a été très satisfait !  La pissaladière était excellente : pâte croquante, oignons parfaitement fondants. Le foie de veau était aussi très tendre, pas sec du tout, et la purée de pdt l'accompagnant semblait faîte maison, hmmm... Le magret de canard aux cerises était très bon aussi, cuit correctement, et la petite purée de patates douces avec était vraiment crémeuse. J'aurais aimé en avoir plus.  J'aurais cependant apprécié que le magret soit un peu plus relevé, par example avec une touche de gros sel. En dessert, les profiteroles étaient très bonnes aussi.  Hôtes très sympa pas stressés  Mon petit ami n'étant pas français, j'étais heureuse de pouvoir lui faire découvrir une authentique atmosphère du sud, qui reste quand même pleine de simplicité. Je recommande sans hésiter."}
{"text":"Not what I expected from the reviews I read. I had the duck and my gf had the gnocchi. Both were over cooked. And the duck plain. We loved the Colomba beer and the basil creme brûlée. The waiter was also very nice! It was a bit overpriced for what we received though. Overall we were a little disappointed."}
{"text":"Super bon diner à Plein Sud hier soir. Une carte variée avec des produits de saison. Les plats sont très parfumés, bien assaisonnés,  et avec des prix bien raisonnables."}
{"text":"Absolutely a wonderful dining experience. We went for late lunch and risotto and the salmon were world class. Great atmosphere amd great service as well."}
{"text":"Super service et nourriture délicieuse. Ça vaut la peine, largement."}
