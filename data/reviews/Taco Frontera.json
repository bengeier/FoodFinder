{"text":"It was traditional Mexican food in a fast food environment. For me and my kids, it was almost  $60. That wasn't the worst of it, we all got sick throwing up, before we even got home! Will not be going back!"}
{"text":"We ordered carryout and the cashier was very nice and was helpful with the menu. My wife had the enchiladas and I had the lengua tacos which was so awesome that I found authentic tacos!"}
{"text":"This is.a gem in a part of town where you will have a hard time finding fresh, delicious food. Taco frontera scores on all fronts. Great selection of real Mexican food, prepared fresh and fast. My very picky eater 11 year old son loved the quesadillas and wanted me to rate it a 4.5! I had the carne asada. Very nice, but I regretted not having tried the tacos or Cubano. Will definitely come back if we are in this area again. Loved the fresh tamarind drink. I'm holding back a star only because I'm comparing with great Mexican fast food sampled all over the country, especially from San Diego."}
{"text":"The food is very good. it's odd to see no cars at times but the food makes up for it. I guess it's in an awkward location."}
{"text":"There tacos are one of the best and most authentic I have ever had in North Carolina.. I ordered 3 asada tacos that we delicious. The red sauce they give you with them has great flavor but was way too hot for me. I will come here again and continue to get the tacos."}
{"text":"Wow, wow, wow...amazing REAL mexican food for crazy cheap! Came here from out of town and I wish we had one where I live. Staff is super friendly and the restaurant is really clean. Impressive to say the least!!"}
{"text":"This real traditional Mexican  not Tex-Mex at all. You can order to go or sit in. My husband had the nacho supreme it had a nice spicy flavor, lots of cilantro, they could use a bit less if the sauce they use to cook the chicken in nachos because it made the chips soggy. He also had the mango quesadilla with steak they used fresh mango and very great tasting steak! I had the beef burrito which had rice and beans, it came with quacamole and a side salad, the salad was a bit to spicy with lots of yummy cilantro, the quacamole was made fresh and tasted like the one I make at home! Portions were great, the dining room was nice and simple but very clean. The servers were friendly, helpful with all my questions and accommodated a quesadilla for my 4yr old. Kids friendly most def."}
{"text":"When you walk in, you may feel a little strange due to the set up of the menu, but fear not!  Tacos, Nachos, guacamole were all wonderful.  Actually best tacos I have had in a long time. Everything tasted fresh made, not out of a bag!  Wow!!!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for something quick to eat and thought we'd give this place a try. It looked very empty in the parking lot, but when we ate the food we couldn't understand why. This TeX Mex food is soooooo amazing. It's fast Mex food but leaps and bounds above taco bell quality. Its tastes freshly made, thing s that are supposed to be crispy are very crispy, and the beans are creamy. Do yourself  favor and try this place next time you're craving some Mexican cuisine."}
{"text":"Ate here last night with my wife and daughter.  We all thought it was excellent.  I had chicken, steak and fish tacos.  Terrific.  The red sauce that accompanies it is HOT, which I love.  My wife had chicken,  steak and carnitas tacos, while my daughter had a chicken quesadilla.  We all raved about the food.  My son and daughter in law live in San Diego, and we've missed the food they have out there.  No longer!  Give these people your business, you won't regret it!  Edit:  Other reviewers say this place is dingy - I don't see that at all.  What it needs is more customers.  Concord Mills is loaded with chain restaurants - we need to support the local ones."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! The $4.95 lunch special is such a great deal! So much to choose from, and everything is made fresh! The only things packaged in the store is the cutlery and ketchup! Authentic Mexican food for prices lower than Taco Bell! If you love fresh authentic Mexican at wonderful prices and great quality, and served to you quickly, look no further than Taco Frontera!"}
{"text":"Almost a little too spicy but great food. Their asada fries remind me of being home in California. The place looks like a trashy place which made me miss San Diego even more. The guacamole was on point."}
{"text":"The most authentic Mexican I have ever had. Very simple menu, not like big Mexican restaurants where they have too much that you don't know what to choose. Made to order so everything is fresh. I got a chorizo, pork, and chicken taco. All three were awesome with the chorizo being my absolute favorite. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"We had an Entertainment Book coupon for this place but when we presented it they said they didn't sign up to give coupons for them. When we mentioned going somewhere else they honored the coupon but said they wouldn't again.   The location is in an old Arby's and the remodeling job was poor. The place is looking dingy too.   The food was subpar. The taco shells and chips weren't fresh and the guac way too spicy. There are way better choices in the area for Mexican food."}
{"text":"The food was so good we were so surprised that the food was fresh and delicious. The best fish tacos on concord mills blvd."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is really nice for a fast food restaurant. It looks as nice as any sit down Mexican place and is very clean. The food is a bit salty (and I love salt so that is a lot coming from me!) but it's definitely the closest to authentic Mexican that I have had in Concord, NC so far..including sit down restaurants! The staff was friendly and very accommodating as well, even after our toddler poured her entire drink all over the floor (again..sorry about that!)  Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Food was quick, tasty, and cheap.  A great family ran business with excellent customer service'"}
{"text":"Wow! Made my day today finding this wonderful place!  We relocated here from Colorado Springs, CO a year ago and I have been searching and searching for Mexican food like I'm used to from home. I finally found it. Amazing!  Baja Cali style street tacos with wonderful carne and al pastor meats (my husband had the chicken taco and he said that was also really good). Also tried the Nacho Supreme and the guacamole was to die for! They even had a chicken quesadilla that my almost 3 year old and 4 1/2 year old actually enjoyed (amazing considering toddlers are some of the most discriminating food critics).  I was very sad that there weren't more people in the restaurant when we dined there. Hoping to get the word out to keep this place alive! So, all of you out there looking for a taste of the Baja, please please please eat here! Affordable prices and amazing food!!!"}
