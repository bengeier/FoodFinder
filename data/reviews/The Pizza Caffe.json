{"text":"Looking for a great place to have some pizza and coffee?  Of course you arent what a bad combo huh?  But this is what this place has and they are both really good.  It also has excellent gelato and good italian dishes.  

It seems over priced until you take a look around and think about how much money it cost to put marble here or tile there.  I really cant imagine how they could make a profit considering how much they must have spent on tables and such.

The service staff doesnt really know what they are doing but they are all sweet and friendly which works for me.

Not worth a trip but head and shoulders above anything else in this area."}
{"text":"We had dinner at The Pizza Caffe on Saturday night and really enjoyed it!   We were driving by, and thought \"hmmmm , let's try it!\" and we are glad we did.  To our surprise, we were greeted by the whole  staff when we entered the restaurant, which was very nice  The atmosphere is pleasant and welcoming overall.  The menu is very good, with choices from sandwiches, panninis, salads and pizza to full traditional Italian entrees including some really interesting items.  The staff was very helpful and attentive!  We were served a nice flatbread w/ olive oil and balsamic while we reviewed the menu and ordered drinks (the drink menu is very nice w/ wines by the glass or bottle, beer and the usual softdrinks. ."}
{"text":"My son & I have been here twice and have to say The Pizza Caffe has the best shrimp scampi & I love their spaghetti & pizza. I am just sorry that the economy has forced them to cut back on their hours and now are closed Sunday. My son was disappointed that they no longer sold gelato. They do have an amazing Chocolate Calzone which will put you into a chocolate coma, it is so rich. The only downfall is that they are located on the complete opposite side of town but worth the trip even in rush hour traffic."}
