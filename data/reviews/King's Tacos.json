{"text":"Echoing what has already been said here, King's Tacos is delicious and great value. I have been here multiple times, and have always left super stuffed and/or with leftovers. 

This place isn't fancy, but it is delicious! I noticed how the subtle flavours of spices really show through, instead of just being salty (full disclaimer, I do love salty things!). The sauces that come with the free chips are very flavourful, and I add them to my tacos!

One star off though, for the service. The staff are lovely, but for a large group sharing, they only brought enough corn tortillas for one per person."}
{"text":"Just came home from King's Tacos and I wish I could have eaten more. I had the Arrechera tacos which is seasoned beef strips. Arrechera is suppose to be a very flavorful beef and it was. Very moist easy to chew seasoned to perfection. I wish I could have had more. Will definitely be going back soon again. They had really great service and the food came very fast. I'd recommend to anyone who love authentic Mexican food or in need of some flavor in their life."}
{"text":"I thought this place was great.  Very friendly service, lots to choose from on the menu!  The tacos were great, my 10 year old loved them too.  The baked potato was literally swimming in butter - not something Id feel proud about eating every day, but it was SO DELICIOUS!
I don't really understand the previous review - they said they had a pina colada, but when we were here, this restaurant was not licensed, I think maybe they have the wrong place!
That baked potato is calling to me...."}
{"text":"I opened up a Yelp account today to write two reviews, and this is one of them.

Check out the reviews on blogto.com (mine the 1st), and you'll see the glowing reviews thus far!

King's Tacos took over another Mexican joint about 3 months or so ago.  The latter seemed only to be in business for a year or so - it was OK, but my wife and I went just once - obviously not good enough to bring us back.

But I'm here today to talk about King's Tacos - the sign says \"since 1983\" and I thought that was strange as I had never heard of them.  I checked google to no avail, so I asked the owner the first time I went there.

It is a chain in fact, but they have 4 restaurants in Chihuahua province in Mexico - this being their first Canadian operation.... good initial sign!

The restaurant itself is casual, not somewhere that you'd sit for 2 hours - I don't even think they are liquor licensed (maybe I'm wrong), but people come here for the food!

I can attest that I live somewhat close so I pass this place 2 or 3 times a week.  To start, I used to see a steady 3 tables of patrons there, and then 5 or 6, now its full.  Not lineup full like some of the \"popular\" spots in Toronto, but by all accounts should be!  The tables are frequented by mostly Latinos which is another good sign!

I've been to many of the \"popular spots around town, for example: El Asador (If I would write a review it'd be 3 or 3.5 out of 5)  El Trompo (similar), Grand Electric (4 stars) - No this isn't the \"authentic\" taco that everyone has been looking for - but they do taste good nonetheless, and the drinks are a bonus.

Now, on to the food at King's Tacos - in 3 trips, Ya vas (mixed meat) do-it-yourself tacos, La carnitas (pulled pork), enchiladas, quesadillas are among some of the items purchased.  I personal favour the tacos dishes that I've tried, but that is just a relative thing as I think all are good, tasty, authentic, and very generous portions.  I've had to bring home food every time I've been.  Also, the amount of REAL nachos that they give you (like a 1/2 bag of Tositos in quantity) with 3 excellent salsas for free is amazing, the guacamole is pretty good as well (I am partial to my wife's though!)

All in all, this will be a spot I can see myself going for a quick bite once a month or so - well done King's Tacos!  Looking forward to sampling some other dishes......."}
{"text":"Very delicious food. Great tortilla chips. Seems family owned. Very courteous staff. Try their Mexican pop bottles. Also try their home made rice water cinnamon beverage! Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Please hurry up and reopen!  I can't wait much longer!  King's Platter and Zarape are amazing.  This is one of my favourite places to go out for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I cannot express how much I love King's Tacos.  I found this place when I first moved to Toronto 2 years ago and have been hooked ever since. Is it the best Mexican in all of North America?  Definitely not, but it is as good as it gets for Mexican in Toronto.  Definitely among the best, if not the best in the city. Good prices and large portions.  My boyfriend always gets the King's Platter and I always get Zarape.  You get a \"welcome service\" for free which is a basket of tortilla chips and 3 salsa varieties.  Next time you crave Mexican, I implore you to skip the trendy, over-packed places and try this authentic hidden gem.  My only complaint is that it is a tad greasy, but it's a given considering most of the dishes are very meat-heavy (although they do have a few vegetarian options as well), however the flavour is so amazing that it is totally worth it to indulge."}
{"text":"I had the Gabacha tacos, marinated pork topped with cheese, and it was fantastic! Very flavourful, and nicely spiced.  The pork was served on a bed of grease, with the tortillas served separately in a warmer, along with a variety of sauces and chopped onion in side dishes.  Generous portions too, I had trouble finishing.  

My girlfriend had the Barbacoa, roast shredded beef.  I found her dish to be somewhat bland compared to the Gabacha, but she seemed to enjoy it for the most part.

Complementary guacamole and tortilla chips were good, though i would have liked some pico de gallo with them - but it was free, so I really shouldn't complain ;) 

Service was good overall, and the staff was friendly.  The restaurant was clean, nothing fancy in the decor department though, it had a serve-yourself look, despite the waiter service.  Unlicensed, which is a shame, they might be busier if they served. 

I'll be going again."}
{"text":"Had the chicken tacos. A little bland but over all pretty good. The sauces are delicious!"}
{"text":"Just returned from another great meal at King's Tacos... I can't believe I have not written sooner. Probably due to the food coma that a visit usually results in.

       I love a place that is simply about feeding people good food in a friendly and honest manner. I cannot count how many visits we have made to King's; today I noticed their mission statement behind the cash for the first time. It is written in Spanish. Which should give you an idea of the target audience here. Now I don't necessarily read Spanish, but I know enough to understand that they are dedicated to good, fresh food prepared by hand in an authentic Mexican way.  The observation that on every visit the patrons are predominantly Hispanic would seem to provide some measure of their success.

       Tonight I had the Bistec & Encebollada tacos and K had the Vegetrianos (she almost always gets this, while I change my choices on each visit). The food always arrives fast and hot and is simply satisfying. Simplicity and necessity could be the defining guidelines for King's Tacos. This is not a fancy place with \"Mexican\" decor (not a sombrero or mariachi poster in sight) but rather a place where the people and the food make the environment. The folks who work here are genuinely great. The food is fresh and flavourful, and really does remind me of some of the local places we ate in during our trips to Mexico. 

       When we first started eating here we were often the only non-Hispanic patrons; it is still predominantly Hispanic but there has been more diversity in the past year or so. This makes me happy, 'cause success means that King's will be around for a while yet. Still no liquor licence, which I think really contributes to the family atmosphere here, and reinforces the primacy of the food. This is a place to eat great food and feel at home. Go. Go again."}
{"text":"About a year ago my wife and I stumbled into King's Taco for dinner while strolling St Clair West. Going in without any big expectations, we were completely blown away by the flavour and quality of the food.  At first glance King's Taco looks appears to be your run of the mill Mexican chain restaurant, but looks are be deceiving.  

The menu offers a variety of standard Mexican dishes, from quesadillas to enchiladas but the real winner is the shared plate where you choose from a selection of grilled meats and sides. What arrives is a large tray filled with meats, vegetables, rice, baked potatoes and as many fresh corn tortillas as you can eat. The menu says it feeds 2 (there are options for larger groups as well) but 4 people could easily split this and be more than satisfied.  They also provide a complimentary bowl of fresh tortilla chips and a few excellent (and very spicy) sauces to each table.

We've returned several times since, for take out and dine in experiences and have never left hungry or with a bad experience. Definitely great value and a nice change from the sub-standard Italian fare around St Clair and Dufferin."}
{"text":"Hmm, I shouldn't trust most of the reviews from Yelp as I had high expectation about this place. At the end, I was disappointed, this place is exactly like other Taco restaurants in this city, overpriced. It's not their fault, other Yelp reviewers were guilty of false marketing.

I ordered their \"specialty\" King Taco - a combination of various meats, for $14.90 (before tax and tips). The portion was so small, just enough to cover the small plate. They gave me 6 pieces of Soft Taco, not filling at all. I asked for refill, they wanted to charge me more, I refused. In terms of taste, I was thinking, ... maybe \"they're going for quality, instead of quantity\". Hmm, not really, it's just salty, couldn't taste any spice at all.

Well, there was something that I like, the \"free\" appetizer of tortilla and 3 large condiments. The condiments are nice, although they're super super hot. They should reduce the heat level by 50%. Not sure whether it's really normal for Mexican/South American for this level of spiciness.  I have eaten many other ethnic food which are famous of being spicy - ChongQing HotPot, Sri Lankan dishes, etc. I didn't sweat for all others, except for this one.

For the Taco, it's 2 star for me - I can increase to 3 star if the price is $6, instead of $14.90. Maybe next time, I should just get the free appetizer, and order $2 items from their menu. Be critical when you read other reviews, the Taco is not filling at all. I left the shop bloated from drinking the water, as the condiment for the free appetizer very hot."}
{"text":"Great place that we have been going to for a while. Excellent service and portions are very generous. 


Also excellent place for a weekday lunch with your kids in tow.  The resturant is spacious enough that it is very stroller friendly."}
{"text":"They've re-opened this week!  We drove by and saw the tables filled for dinner one evening this week.  Happy dance time, and a rushed drive to St. Clair for lunch the next day!

The new space is actually highly similar to the previous space in terms of the dining room layout.  I guess the old layout worked for them?  It definitely works for us!

Upon ordering (and yes, we ordered like pigs because we soooo missed this place), we were given a basket of chips, three different salsa/dips and limes and onion/cilantro mix for the tacos.  We especially like the chipotle sauce and can drink it like soup.  It's excellent!  Then we waited.  We ordered a half guac;  a queso chorizo, and we opted for the make your own tacos options of Zarape and Hawaiianos.  

It was great to see that the menu items have not changed, but I think each item has gone up by $1-2.  Our order above came to almost $60 incl tax, before tip...but admittedly, two of us ordered enough to feed 4+.

The only disappointment is that the basket of chips came with some tortilla chips that were not fully crispy.  Since we're so happy they've finally reopened, we didn't point this out to the staff.  If this is the case on our next visit, it'll definitely be pointed out, and a star deducted.

Welcome back King's Tacos!!"}
{"text":"We purchased the carnitas & barbacoa tacos ( pulled pork & pulled beef), the portions are generous, however the meats are extremely fatty.  Not good for me. 
We also order a soup with chicken and vegetables, it was pretty good. I would go back but will try something different."}
{"text":"My friends and I were in the mood for Mexican so we tried this place.  I had remembered a Mexican woman say to me that in order to tell if a Mexican place is good make sure there are lots of Mexicans earring in there. She recommended this place to me. Let me say that I really enjoyed the food. The chips at the beginning. The refried  beans yum. The toppings are fantastic. It's unfortunate that there is no alcohol because a corona or a sol is all that is missing from this great meal"}
{"text":"Such a great place!  The complimentary Tortilla chips and dips are amazing!  The tacos al pastor are so tasty. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We started with the guacamole, it was ok, meh nothing special. Also ordered the grilled green onions which were great. For the Tacos we shared the Pastor, It was delicious and came with grilled onions, jalapeno and three sauces. Overall food was good and the atmosphere is nice and clean. A bit pricey, but if you're in the neighbourhood and craving tacos, it gets the job done!"}
{"text":"Had the munchies something fierce on a Wednesday night so decided to check this place out

 Food was fantastic and great portions.

This place is best to go with a few friends so you can get a few different dishes and share them.

Will definately be heading back soon !"}
{"text":"This is an amazing taco place! They start you off with chips and 3 different salsas and they are so good! The food is amazing here and we cannot wait for the restaurant to re-open again!

We've had better guacamole elsewhere--always feel it lacks flavour, but everything else is great!"}
{"text":"REAL mexican food. Proper tacos. Been here about 15-20 times and it's good every time."}
{"text":"I tried Many Mexican Restaurants in Toronto and I was very disappointed by not finding a good Mexican Restaurant. I was deciding I would never try Tacos if Kings' Tacos would not be good. Then I tried King's Tacos and I was glad I tried. Finally I found King's Tacos. King's Tacos gave us tortillas separately and I made own Tacos. I really liked it because people in Mexican TV shows were always taking Tortillas and putting ingredients to make own Tacos. I felt like I were in Mexico. I ordered King's special and menu said King's special was famous. It was good. Including tax, it costed $20 and it had good size of meals.  I would definitely come back King's Tacos because I lived on St.Clair."}
{"text":"Stopped in as a fallback since the place we wanted to go to was closed, and now we're glad we did, because we've discovered another great family-friendly eatery in the neighbourhood. I had the marinated pork tacos, which were very tasty, my husband had a burrito that he all but gobbled up, and our 3.5 year old was thrilled that she could have quesadillas -- her favourite -- although she wasn't into trying one of their many varieties (with chicken, steak, veggies, etc.). The sauces that came with the complimentary (house-made?) tacos were excellent, and I heaped my favourite one onto my tacos, along with the chopped onion/cilantro and spritzes of lime (lime shortage be damned!) for an extra flavour hit. We left having added another local resto to our roster. 

Plus they were showing the World Cup and it wasn't insane with drunken fans -- just families come to cheer on their home countries (it was the Honduras/Ecuador game). Lively but laid-back and comfortably casual."}
{"text":"I normally don't give 5 stars to a place with very ordinary decor. The food however makes u overlook that short coming.

From the nachos to the rice to the meats to the salsas. Everything was awesome. 

I would highly recommend to families and larger groups as it is more economical."}
{"text":"Very good place to have mexican tacos and quesadillas I haven't try the whole menu but today I had the gringa with pastor pork and let me tell you that it was amazing. The pastor pork was very rich and the portion was what I was expecting but half on it I was already full. They gave us chips and salsas before the main to snack very tasty treat. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I am Mexican and I can say this place is very good for Mexican food. I haven't been in a better place for Mexican food in Toronto. The only bad thing is that they don't have drinks and some Mexican traditional dishes, but almost every thing there is good."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to kings taco on the weekend, and it was not very busy. service was pretty slow and they don't have a liquor license! 
We ordered enchiladas and they were okay. Not a lot of flavour truthfully, I believe we ate more of the chips and salsa than our entree. Sub par, will be looking for a New Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"The best of the Mexican restaurants I've tried in the general area (others are Cantina, Revolution, and Asado). Prices are reasonable and portions fairly generous, and the food is very good. I had the beef and mushroom tacos, and my partner had the shredded pork. His tacos were made for him, and I made my own, which I really liked, because I could control what went in them. They give you nice fresh chips with three dips for free."}
{"text":"The best taco place in Toronto! No contest! I've tried them all!

I've literally hunted out taco places in Toronto for the past 5 years. And although there are some good contenders (e.g. Tenoch, Mexican Salsas,  etc).

But sadly most are disappointing and or strictly cater to the Burrito style of 'mexican food'.

Long live the King!"}
{"text":"Our new go-to Mexican place!  Recommended by a friend who's married to a Mexican and loves great food.  

Every meal starts with a basket of addictively crispy tortillas & 3 delicious sauces (the chipotle & hot pepper are amazing). We started with the queso & chorizo which is served with perfectly thin & soft, warm tortillas and had an astounding anount of meat compared to far more expensive/trendy restos downtown.  I had the veg enchilada in green sauce which is supposed to be spicier than the red sauce but I couldn't taste any heat at all (disclaimer: I'm a hot pepper junky).  The veg filling was a bit too oily but decent flavours. My sis had the enchiladas sub w/ carnitas (pork) instead of beef which was delicious!  1 order = 4 enchiladas literally smothered in cheese + rice + salad.  The rice is delicious but the salad was more of a garnish (not very appealing). 1 meal would have been enough for us to share, but that's ok we had our leftovers for dinner the next day"}
{"text":"I freakin' LOVE this place. Probably best that they don't deliver, I would order it 3 times a week. Huge portions, reasonably priced, and the staff is super friendly and quick. Come hungry, but don't fill up on the free tortilla chips (a challenge in itself as they are amazing). 

Tortillas are fresh and warm. A selection of sauces of varying degrees of heat are provided with the free tortillas. Also, should you choose to order the guacamole, you only need the small. Trust.

No, they do not have a liquor license. Be brave. They have a great selection of mexican soda and other drinks. I'm sure you can deal with having one meal without booze. If not, get some help."}
{"text":"3.5

When you walk into King Taco, You'll feel like you just entered a fast food joint from the 1980's. All a glow in red and yellow, the place offers little in the way of ambiance. But the tacos are solid and the amount of food you get for the price gives them points on the value scale.

I ordered the Barbacoa, which was good, but I thought it lacked any depth of flavour and my boyfriend had one that I can't remember the name of but it was pork with cheese. His was delicious-- greasy and bursting with taste! The tortilla chips and salsas that arrive almost instantaneously were abundant and fresh. However, the salsas left a little to be desired-- for me, anyway. My boyfriend liked most of them, but we both agreed that the 'hot' one was not really very spicy. I'm also taking half a point off because I asked for extra extra hot sauce and the waiter didn't bring me any. I'm not sure if he was insulted that I told him the hot sauce wasn't hot enough, but he wandered off without saying anything and didn't return. I was left holding my next taco for a few minutes to see if he would come back with something spicier, but he never did.

I also took half a point off for the lack of a liquor license. I would love this place mucho mas if I could have some tequila with my tacos. I guess that's what take out is for.

I'd definitely come back here with a bottle of Chimay in my pocket to amp up the spice a bit. I'd also like to try a few more things off them menu. King Taco is an excellent value and the food is really good. Is it authentic? I'd say so. different areas of Mexico have many different ways of doing their salsas. The ones here seem to be more from the northern region of Mexico-- very mild and not spicy enough for me. But the serving style of the meat on the side and make your own taco is quite traditional and the flavours are there.

Definitely worth the trip. I might recommend a picking up some of this food for a backyard party or a picnic."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim with the Hubster and was quite happy with our meal.

He ordered the King's Monster Torta and I ordered the carne asada tacos.

He LOVED his sandwich. He planned to eat half (it really was monster sized) and eat the other half later, but ended up eating most of it in one go. My tacos were fine, but needed salt (which was on the table, no problem.) I haven't had a great experience with beef at a restaurant ever, and this was no different. They were fine, but not great. Next time, I'll likely get pork.

Service was very good and the place filled up very quickly during dinner time. One big table had some family-style meal thing going on, which is what's going to happen next time we visit, and there WILL be a next time.

Note, this place doesn't serve booze."}
{"text":"After hearing rave reviews about this place from my brother, who loves food more than I do, we finally had a chance to feast on the delicious tacos from here. For 6 people we ordered a large guacamole, refried beans and 3 orders of the special build your own tacos (king's special, chorizo and beef with onion). 

When you arrive, they bring you unlimited nachos and their three sauces, mild, medium and spicy. The mild was my favourite! I can't really describe it but it has a nice smokey flavour and orange in colour. The medium is a green hot sauce which was equally delicious with a nice kick. The spicy was my least favourite. It was kind of spicy, but flavourless. 

The guacamole was delicious. It was perfectly mashed and not too chunky or too creamy. 

The refried beans were yummy, but really heavy so I didn't have too much of it. 

My favourite of the three meats we tried was the kings special. I loved the mix of all the flavours of beef, chorizo and bacon mixed with onions. Yummmm! The beef with onion and the chorizo were good, but for some reason, saltier than the kings special. Also, all these plates are extremely greasy, so keep that in mind because you won't be able to stop yourself from stuffing your face until you can't breath. It's just that delicious. The only downfall was that I felt really crappy for the next few days. The food here is really heavy and oily and it will be coming out of your pores. 

The service here is great! They're quick and friendly. This has been one of my favourite taco experiences in Toronto thus far!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. The basket of chips and dips they bring you is heavenly. The tacos themselves are fabulous - the meat is flavourful and moist, the tortillas are really good as well. Every time I'm in the neighbourhood, I stop by. There's live music on Sunday afternoons, so it tends to be packed around that time. There's always a lot of Spanish being spoken by staff and guests as well, which is always a good sign.

I often get the gabacha, my boyfriend tends to get a steak-y onion-y thing whose name I can't remember. So delicious."}
{"text":"I felt like I was part of the family in this quaint restaurant. The food was fantastic and the people are great. They came out singing with an accordion and saxophone for someone's birthday."}
{"text":"I'd been meaning to go here for a long time, and then they closed while transitioning to their new location, so the wait (and all of the great reviews I'd read) maybe built up the expectations too high...  Came here yesterday for dinner with my teenaged son, and the place was busy, but not full (due to the rainy day?).  

SERVICE:  We waited for at least 10-15 minutes at the front of the restaurant while servers in yellow shirts and bus-staff in red shirts flitted around.  Not one greeting or acknowledgement.  Finally, a server noticed us as she was approaching another table with their food, and nodded her head over to a 2-top by the door to the washrooms.  Seating ourselves at the table, we surveyed the fresh new digs and they are not fancy--that's fine, but with all the talk of great service, we were shocked that we sat for another 15-20 minutes without a single approach, menu, or anything.  Finally, I asked someone bussing a table if we could have the menu from the table she was clearing.  Finally able to share at least one menu, my son and I perused the menu.  Great, authentic options.  We settled on the gabacha and fortachon \"You make your own tacos\" options--based on what we'd seen at other people's tables, we figured it would be more than enough for us (and it was).  Another 10 minutes passed before a server finally came over to take our orders.  Things started to get a little better after that.  After ordering, I had to sneak out to add more money to the parking meter, as we'd been in the place for over 35 minutes before being able to actually order, and I figured we'd be there for some time.  I got back, and our drinks were on the table, as well as a basket of complimentary chips and the salsas, cut lime wedges, and onion/cilantro combo we'd be using for the tacos in small ramekins.

Luckily we had those chips, as it would be at least another 20-25 minutes before the tacos arrived.  We were watching the Olympics on one of the large screen TVs, and I think we saw at least three entire boxing matches and part of a football (soccer) match (live, not highlights) in the time since we'd been seated.  By then, we'd polished off most of the chips.  

FOOD:  Chips tasted freshly made, a bit greasy but well paired with the trio of delicious salsas.  Gabacha (pork) was well seasoned (but not spicy), covered in cheese and in massive quantity--our favourite of the two.  The fortachon, a combination of beef and chorizo sausage (also covered in cheese) was also in ample quantity, also well seasoned, but heavier on the beef than the chorizo.  The heated tortillas in the round stay-warm container were plain and plentiful (at least a dozen in there!), a good base for the food (and they stayed SUPER hot throughout the entire meal!).  Drinks:  we settled on an orange Jarritos and Sprite, as I was interested by their mango juice and horchata options, but neither are made in-house--if that had been the case we would've jumped all over that!!!  

As we began to eat , we noticed that there were zero napkins on the table, and none had been brought with the food.  It wasn't until we were three tacos down each that I managed to flag someone down to get the napkins.  How does a table get bussed and then served with this omission?  I mean, I didn't expect fine dining, but this is a taco place, you're going to be eating with your hands!!!  Looking around, there appeared to be napkins on pretty much every other table except ours.

Honestly, if this was based only on the service, I'd have given 1 star--VERY disappointing.  The food and pricing is a 4/5, so to be generous and chalking it up to some re-opening service kinks, I will give it a 3.  IF we come back and the service doesn't improve, there are lots of other authentic  Mexican restaurants out there..."}
{"text":"I arrived at 8:PM.  I am not hispanic,so you are getting a review with canadian eyes.   I ordered the King Taco, and my friend ordered a taco plate called Ya Vas.  The Quality was good...nothing looked cheap.  Service was quick, and I noticed there were quite a few hispanics there..so am thinking the food was pretty authentic.  Staff were friendly.  Recommend."}
{"text":"As close as it gets to the real deal, consistent, typically good service when owner is around, and yes it's greasy  sorry but that's just go it goes! 
Favorite thing to have is the gringas and tacos al pastor!!"}
{"text":"So much delicious food.  The staff is friendly. The decor is plain but perfect because it creates a very relaxed atmosphere. 

The King's special are glorious. The red sauce is incredibly hot and spicy, so be careful. 

Bring lots of friends so you can try a large variety of dishes; relax; plan to stay for a long time.  Try everything."}
{"text":"From the outside this restaurant looks like a fast food joint but they produce high quality food.. which is pretty close to authentic. It's priced well and the portions are generous."}
{"text":"We gave this place another try after a lackluster first time.  The tacos are a little different and underwhelming but the quesadilla and rice were very tasty and the burrito had a lot of value.  It gets very busy - we've been for lunch and dinner - so expect friendly but bustling service."}
{"text":"On a rainy June day in Toronto, my boyfriend and I went for a stroll along Corso Italia trying to avoid the rain, while also filling our bellies with food! We spotted some great Yelp reviews of this place and tucked in, just in time, to get some grub.

One thing I will warn you about immediately is that the portions are very generous! Especially for those used to the meagre portions found in other Mexican places in the city, this place does not leave you hungry and waiting for more. We made that mistake when we ordered delicious tacos and the vegetarian nachos and we had to leave half the nachos behind! The reason is that each table gets complimentary  tortilla chips served with 5 different bowls of toppings. Three are different sauces, a bowl of limes and a bown of diced fresh onions and cilantro. You've already started and you didn't even know it yet! The tacos come with at least six flour tortillas and enough meat and veggie to OVERSTUFF all six of them and still leave some on the plate to shovel off with your forks!

The ambiance is that of a family-owned/run business. Patrons are strangers, family and friends and when we went, there was a children's birthday party winding down (that is, the adults were winding down while the children were running wild) it's definitely a louder atmosphere since there are lots of families, but the staff are super friendly and the food came really fast. They have a great selection of sodas, flavoured water and other beverages as well.

I'm going to reiterate what I said earlier, come with an appetite and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Seriously good tacos.  Really friendly servers.  Great prices.  What else do you want?!"}
{"text":"Ok, I was worried there for a minute or two.  But, on my second trip there for lunch recently, THEY ARE BACK TO FULL FORM.  So glad.  Everything tasted like it used to.  Service was good.  And the new restaurant is a pleasant upgrade.  Thanks KT!  You were missed.  And I'll be back.....regularly."}
{"text":"A disappointment for vegetarians. I'd read about King's tacos on Yelp and on some Facebook discussions and expected to be pleasantly surprised by their home-style serving style and innovative veggie options. Sadly that did not happen. 

We ordered the veggie tacos and were excited to try the welcome chips and salsas. Turns out at least one of the salsas has chicken stock - why!? - and the rest were just watery meh. 

The veggie tacos were fine at best. Pretty oily and just boring. And, finding a meat piece in the veggie mix was the final straw. Definitely won't be back and still in search of a decent veggie taco in Toronto. Tips welcome!"}
{"text":"nice food and nice service. definitely some authentic tasting food which they boast.  i had the enchiladas which I was warned about the spice level and I guess I misheard my waiter when she told me it didnt matter if the green/red one was spicier than the other. i had the green sauce one cause I like mexican cuisime verde sauce and was hoping for some heat but nothing. fucking tasty though and the chicken inside was perfect. i dont know how to describe each side dish that went with it cause it blended well together. definitely yummy"}
{"text":"Simply delicious food, beautifully presented. Friendly and helpful staff that seem genuinely happy to have me there, even on my first visit, even though the place was pretty busy.

Amazing tacos with a great selection of toppings.

Food comes with a generous side of nachos and a selection of hot sauces, onions/cilantro, and lots of lime (gotta have lime!)

Love being able to grab a Jarritos on occasion.

Good alone, better with friends to order lots and try everything."}
{"text":"It's baaaaack! The menu doesn't appear to have changed. Great Tacos. I like the tasty and spicy Tacos Mexicana."}
{"text":"This is a simple yet satisfying Mexican restaurant with not much fanfare but really authentic and delicious food. 

It's real fresh too which is a big plus in my eyes."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food! Generous portions and the complimentary chips & dip are what make me keep coming back. And if you love spiciness, then anything classified as \"spicy\" on the menu is sure to fulfill your adventurous tastes! Glad to have this in the 'hood."}
{"text":"If you want good Mexican food in a nice clean place at a fair price then come here. The food is abundant. The staff are super sweet. And the experience is totally Mexico meets Canada. We ordered the dinner for two. It starts with fresh tortillas with three salsa dips. Then the bean soup came out. It was so good. Then the meal begins. We had a large platter filled with a choice of two different meats. Two sides. And roasted onions. The corn tortillas were hot and supple. We ate our faces off. A must for those soft taco cravings."}
{"text":"Seriously delicious food. We got the 2P platter which comes with two meats. Roasted onion and jalapeños, two sides, tortillas, and really amazing bean soup filled with sausage and pork. The table comes with freshly cooked tortilla chips, various dips, onions, cilantro, and lime. The prices are really good. And the portions will knock you on your butt."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch got there around 12.30 and it was really empty, just my table of 2 and what I am assuming is the family of the staff eating lunch. There is pretty much no decor, and it was unfortunately a bit cold inside and really cold everytime someone opened the door. And  for some reason it sounded like a bad trumpet band was practising from the kitchen (it was very confusing)

We ordered the nachos, King special tacos and another with avocado and peppers. Each table gets a complimentary basket of chips and 3 different types of salsas and sauces which were delicious. The red one was really spicy and the green one was super creamy. The nachos were just meat and cheese and a giant scoop of sour cream. 

The tacos were build your own which makes the meal extra fun! The tortillas come in the cutest basket - they were so warm and soft I wanted to wrap myself in one like a blanket. A plate of food may not look like much but it is very filling. For two people you could share a plate of nachos and order 1 taco meat plate and you will be stuffed."}
{"text":"King's Tacos is one of my favourites. Located on St. Clair Ave W, it is a nice distance towards small boutiques and makes for a good stroll. The atmosphere inside is great, and the servers are very welcoming. A bit on the pricey side, but the food is filling, and requires a bit of interaction (think of make your own tacos), which is a nice touch. Reminds me of homemade cooking which I really liked. I have not tried their vegetarian menu yet, but the meat was well cooked and the sauces added a great touch. Nice authentic taste. Really enjoyed the experience. Perfect for a get together with your girlfriends."}
{"text":"Live in the area so decided to try this place because it had good user ratings on here. What a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. Food was horrible (meat tasted like it was made with instant packets) and the service was even worse. waitress had asked us 3 times if we were ready to order within 2 minutes of sitting down. Entrees came out within 5 minutes of receiving appetizers and then waitress disappears. They need some lessons on hospitality and serving!!! Stay far far away from this HORRIBLE Mexican restaurant"}
{"text":"Amazing tacos!  The portions are huge and the flavor is authentic as it gets!

The chips are homemade and the salsas are great!

No liquor license but the food is well worth it!"}
{"text":"Was with 3 other couples and we all shared tacos..I loved that they put all the taco filing on a huge dish so you can put on your own tortillas, but the Hawaiian was by far my favourite, the meats and veggies all tasted sooo good"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time and will definitely come back!! We tried this place on a whim because our regular taco place was closed.  Had found this on yelp and it had pretty good reviews so we decided to give it a try.  As you can see by the pictures is looked great, but not only does it look great it tastes great.  I have never been to a Mexican restaurant like this, basically you make your own tacos. And by the portion size they give you, you can make about 5 tacos. The staff was friendly and nice as well.  I would very much definitely come again.  I just wish I didn't have to pay for street parking."}
{"text":"It had been a very long time since I've eaten Mexican food and I was given the opportunity by one of my foodie groups to dine at King's Taco for a Mexican Independence Day theme dinner.
It was definitely a worthwhile experience and the dishes spoke for themselves.
The complimentary I'm assuming fried-at-home tortilla chips were very crisp to the bite yet light to the taste. Also part of the complimentary condiments are three very distinctly colored sauces, a red sauce (the spiciest out of the three sauces), an orange medium sauce and a pastel green colored sauce which was mild and which almost everyone at the table mistook for guacamole. The amount of heat in the latter two sauces were altogether absent that no matter how many times I tried them I couldn't tasty anything that hinted of chili peppers in them.
The menu was filled with what I can only recognize as Tex-mex style meaty dishes, the amount of 'carne' in each picture seemed to push themselves in your face as you looked them up and it was rather hard to make a pick because they were all asking to be tried. In the end I picked the dish with a name that stood out, the 'Montado Chihuahua' with the re-fried beans and the shredded meat. The filling tasted well-seasoned which went well with the crispness of the tortilla. The only one concern that everyone at my end of the table agreed on was that the fillings could have done with more spice in them,
The one eye-catching feature for the dishes that came with tortillas was the baskets in which the tortillas were served. Each basket had a similar flower motif on them which was colored different on each basket, quite fiesta style looking!
And even though the staff seemed abit overwhelmed with handling our large party they carried out their work professionally.
I'll definitely try out this place again when I'm the St Clair West area."}
{"text":"Was debating between giving this 4 or 5 stars. The quesadila was delicious and the best i've ever had. The salsa it came with were awesome too. But it was a bit greasy so definitely not the healthiest. One of the best mexican places i've been too!"}
{"text":"My favourite Mexican food in the city. The jalapeño dip that they serve at the beginning of the meal? A+! I could drink it. 

It doesn't try to be trendy or fancy. Just really delicious food."}
{"text":"So from the outside I'm not really impressed by what I see....actually I'm more  impressed by Ginger's signage then what I see (which is a book on its own)l but , never judge a book by its cover and experience has taught me that lots of pretty places are shitty and lots of not so pretty places are diamond.

I go in.
Pleasantly surprised at the cleanliness (I was expecting dingy) and the cozy atmosphere. It was not fancy but I'm rarely fancy so that suited me just fine. 

Service? oh am gee,  awesome. Our waitress came checked on us at the most perfect time and was SO NICE... I really just wanted to give her a hug because that sort of service you don't see often anymore in restaurants. I teared a bit, I really did.

Food.
Well. This is my first Mexican food. I was not prepared at all.
But I loved that there is 3 bowls of sauces, freshly diced onions with my favourite - Cilantro - which is a uber thumbs up in my books.
the fresh tortillas came in a little quaint pot with hand painted lid (another uber thumbs up). I really can't describe how PLEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASED I was to see all these little considerations. Like the zillion air freshners in the washroom, the painting on the wall...
Food was so delicious and made me realize how low my spicy food tolerance level has dropped....but perfect in every way.

I simply cannot give it 5 stars because I have nothing to compare to. 

Maybe it was just that I was with good company. Maybe its my honeymoon stage with this place - I'm definitely gonna have to go back again..."}
{"text":"The food is quite good but its too expensive"}
{"text":"These are the best tacos in the city!

I don't spout things like this lightly. I have seriously not had a better taco in Toronto. Yes there are lots of excellent gourmet tacos to be found, but if you want straight-up delicious, authentic Mexican tacos, this is the place to dine.

From the outside the place doesn't look like much. Inside however, the decor is nice, though simple. Everything is in great repair. There's a dozen tables which are spread out nicely so you're not crammed in next to the table beside you. The staff were great during my visit. There's a little bit of a language barrier but nothing to stop them from providing great service.

Now on to the best part...the food! Every table gets a complimentary basket of tortilla chips and 5 bowls filled with delicious sauces and toppings. There were three different sauces, of which I fell in love with the smoky chipotle one. You also get a bowl of limes, essential for any taco, and the last bowl is a mix of cilantro and diced onions. The tortilla chips must be made in-house. They're ridiculously fresh, unsalted, and have a hint of oil.

To drink I grabbed a couple glasses of horchata during my visit. The drink was a very milky white compared to the cinnamon brown that I have come to expect in past experiences. Never-the-less it did not disappoint.

For my main course I went with tacos of course, though there are other options like burritos and soups on the menu. Being my first visit I decided to play it safe and went with what I knew. I asked if they would split the carnitas and barbacoa plates in half so that I could try both, which they happily obliged. The tacos come bare, just the meat in the soft corn taco shell, and are served with a side of grilled onions. There is no other word to describe these than \"perfect\". The meat was juicy, with a little bit of fattiness, and nicely shredded. When topped with the chipotle sauce they put on the table, I am left speechless.

For two glasses of horchata, 4 tacos, and a bowl of chips, the bill came to less than $20. I was left stuffed and extremely happy. You need to check this place out."}
{"text":"Nice, clean place. Delicious food. Though the guacamole could use some more salt and to be less cold, at least that's what my Mexican experience has taught me. 
The tacos al pastor are so far one of the best ones you can get here in the Toronto area though they're not 100% made the original Mexican way (al trompo).
Horchata was as good as it can be for a Mexican drink prepared outside of Mexico.
Attention is really good. I was really hungry and my food was ready on my table within 8 minutes of crossing the entrance door. Keep the good job Amigos!"}
{"text":"Amazing tacos. Had the king taco which was mainly meat. Flavor was good. Not to salty. Wish it has come with lettuce and tomato's though. You are basically just left with the tortilla and may. Still a good meal."}
{"text":"I almost want to give it 5 stars.

I've had trouble finding sublime mexican food in Toronto, and I've gone to a lot of spots throughout the entire city.  

You're going to get generous proportions, average cost and little frills at this spot.  Usually they nail the flavours, and sometimes not, which says something about how many times I go there.

I wouldn't take a romantic date there, but I'd certainly take a bud."}
{"text":"My spouse and I absolutely love this place , it's definitely our go to place for all food Mexican, the tacos el pastor ( marinated pork) in our opinion is the best in the city, so flavourful. Today we decided to have lunch at kings and it did not disappoint , I ordered ( I forgot the Spanish term) but basically a giant quesadilla cut into two filled with tasty barbacoa( Mexican braised shredded beef) cheese, lettuce, tomato and avocado .....then heated on the griddle... awesome !!! My spouse went with the usual tacos el pastor which is served on 4 house made tortillas along with grilled onions and a grilled jalapeño . They offer a complimentary totopa chip basket along with a trio of home made sauces ( mild,medium, hot) each time you sit in their restaurant ( family owned by the way and owner is super friendly and passionate about his business) we are so lucky to have a place like kings taco just down the street.
If you decide to go on a weekend go early as this place gets busy,for good reason of course."}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant in Toronto.  I've tried the majority of them and King Taco is truly the King."}
{"text":"I ordered the pastor tacos and they were just ok, a little bland, and did not contain all the ingredients shown in the menu photo. Service was ok, not overly friendly, not sure I'd return."}
{"text":"Mission accomplished!  This is the best Mexican food I've had in Toronto, and it probably ranks among the best Mexican food I've had ever in life.  That's saying a lot, since I used to live in Los Angeles.

The place looks non-descript from the outside, but it's spacious and clean inside.  We had great service from a young man with braces, who was super friendly and attentive.  The food came out very quickly, starting with a hefty portion of home made tortilla chips with three kinds of (delicious!) salsa.  I love Jamaica drink and it's generally hard to find.  They have it here and it's good, it doesn't taste like powdered crap.  We ordered guacamole, and it came with its own large portion of chips as well.  We ended up adding salt to the chips and lime to the guac, but that was fine since both were at the table.  I had chicken enchiladas with green salsa, it's the same delicious green salsa that comes with chips, quite spicy and oh so yummy.  The dish came with two sides, I chose the rice, which was great, and salad, which was basically just lettuce with a tomato slice on top.  Next time I'd probably opt for something else in place of the salad.

My boyfriend ordered both a shredded pork burrito and tacos el pastor.  Both were amazing.  I had to take home a doggy bag, since it was just soo much food.  King's Tacos' flavours are authentic, portions generous and it's all quite well priced.  We went home and passed out in a happy food coma.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  Great prices, authentic Mexican food too! Definitely will return!"}
{"text":"This is now the best mexican restaurant in town IMO. I generally measure a place by their pastor tacos, and this place's are extremely tasty.

Also tried the beef dishes and they are excellent. However, the one thing I would avoid next time are the dishes with chorizo. This tastes more like kolbasa sausage to me (and not my favourite).

You can tell this place is the real deal because everyone who works there is mexican as are many of the patrons.

Great atmosphere.. there was a large party there when we went and some live mexican music was busted out for the occasion.

Excellent service and the owner was vey friendly and told me all about how the restaurant started in mexico with 4 locations and then migrated entirely here.

Last note: no booze here. Only non-alcoholic drinks.

I'll be back. Recommended."}
{"text":"Fantastic fresh food at a reasonable price. Very authentic and delicious. The service was fast and friendly. All around it was a great experience."}
{"text":"Love love love Mexican food! And this place was beyond amazing. The portion were much bigger then we expected. We later did feel like we had ordered too much. The chicken was very well seasoned, no dryness at all, the chorizo for the \"make your own tacos\" was a bit too greasy, but was extremely tasty! I would highly recomiendo the chicken enchiladas. I think there should be more toppings for the tacos, and some more cocktail options. The service was great, and everyone was super helpful."}
{"text":"Ordered the Guacamole + tortilla chips, and the King's special (different types of meats, pork and beef, cheese and comes with 6 tortillas) for take out (was feeling lazy) - it came to about 26$ and was delicious, I shared the plate, and we didn't finish, it lasted us for lunch the next day!

I can say all was great. I regret not sitting in, as I hear the tortillas would have been complementary and they give you tons of sauces.

I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Its a crying shame that the manager does not know how to deal with clientele, is racist and thinks that he is managing a restaurant in some backwater town in mexico. 
I'd had beef tongue tacos as take out prior to visiting the restaurant ... And they had been so good that I went back for more. This time they were dripping with oil , although still tasty. I call the server over and told her I wouldn't be eating them as the oil had dripped down my forearm as I took a bite of my taco, and that I would like the menu to order something else.  The server was nice and polite handed me the menu and left with the oily tacos. My husband us sharing his soup with me and the manager shows up... Blonde blue eyed man. He asks me what do I want to do with the oily tacos..should he pack them so i can take them home? I say no thanks. 
He mentions that he will be charging then on my bill.
I tell him.. They are inedible.
He says they are not and that he will charge then to my bill.
I tell him.. \" no you won't charge them and if you do I won't pay for them\".
He tells me that it's not fair for the server to absorb the cost, therefore I should pay. I said no... Not fair I should pay for something inedible or the server.
my husband at this point is not even finished with his meal and is hearing  this poor excuse of a manager argue over the oily tacos , standing over out table. 
When he saw that I was calmly nonchalantly saying no, things escalate ...
\" I will call the cops if you don't pay!\"
Wow... I couldnt believe it....he not only threaten to call the cops once he did it a few times until i asked for the owner. How embarassing having to walk the stretch if the restaurant while everyone sat there looking at us walk over to the owner. The cook the manager and the owner.. All involved over the damn  oily tacos! I go on to explain again and I let her know what poor excuse of a manager she has...and at the end she says...  I am sorry, that shouldn't have happened. 
My poor husband didn't finish his meal, yet after the owner apologized there was the bill for the food minus the the oily tacos. I paid the bill and walked out...my husbands food barely eaten. 
I regret to see this happen because some establishment s where immigrants are the basis for the clientele, use intimidating tactics to get their way, just like the idiot manager. 

Side note: no liquor license, no A/C during summer time."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst Mexican restaurant I've been to. You know what it tastes like; a Mexican place not ran by the mexican culture. 

I ordered a quesadilla that completely fell apart, the taste wasn't awful but could have been better. Had to ask for sour cream and salsa for dipping; which I would have expected it to come with.

My partners beef tacos was very dry. We expected even some lettuce and tomatoes to add to it not just these dipping sauces meant for the chips. When asked about the salsa and tomatoes they said they had none but would check for salsa. She brought some out afterwards. What Mexican restaurant have you ever been told, there would possibly be no salsa?! A lot more condiments should be brought with these foods.

The best part of my meal were the fries (which were ordered separately) that's it. The appetiser of chips were bland and sauces nothing special. If you want bland tacos this is the place for you. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Love everything about this place! The food is always very fresh and the portions very generous. You can spend like a peasant and eat like a king!  I think my favourite thing is that this is a very well run and proud restaurant.  The servers are very friendly and always take care of you and the manager is always around making sure you are having a good time.  More restaurants should be like these guys!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The food is delicious, reasonably priced, and the portions are generous. The decor and service are low key, but clean and efficient. 

We've been looking for authentic Mexican home cooking and King's Tacos is it!  It's the first place I've actually considered NOT reviewing because it's that awesome.

For 2 of us we split chicken fajitas and a small guacamole and were stuffed. The chicken was white meat and perfectly cooked. the fajitas came with chicken, rice, salad, (with sliced avocado!) and warm corn tortillas. The three complimentary house made sauces and salsas were super spicy and delicious. You also get complimentary homemade tortilla chips. 

I grew up in the southern U.S and routinely went to small hole-in-the wall super-cheap authentic immigrant run Mexican places that are ubiquitous in Southern states. This place finally reminded me of being at one of those, not the fancy, trendy overpriced Mexican fusion which is typical in Toronto. 

Can't wait to try everything else on the menu!"}
{"text":"Yummy tacos! Decent portion! Surprise they don't serve alcohol here though! The guac & chips is awesome! Shared the kings special which came with 6 soft flour tortillas, added an extra order of 3 more to finish the meal.
Ordered this whitish drink thought it looked like coconut water, turns out it was this rice and sugar drink that tasted like cinnamon!

The condiments it came with wasn't hot! Could use extra spicy!"}
{"text":"I've been here on different occasions and I've never been disappointed. Everything is made fresh and tasty, not spicy or over seasoned, just right. It's perfect for large groups and families."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible!

I spent several years living in California (as well as New York) in addition to travelling to Mexico.

While that didn't make me any kind of expert it got me used to a certain quality and \"authenticity\" level of Mexican food.

The Mexican food I've had thus far in Toronto (with the notable exception of El Trompo) is like what an Italian Canadian fast food cook thinks Mexican food might taste like. In other words, inauthentic and bland Italian chain restaurant tasting. Just sad, really.

Great (and FRESH!) Mexican food. Good prices. Good service.

I would be happy to take any of my old American friends (who know Mexican food) to this place with pride."}
{"text":"Better food writers and chefs than I have often said that the hallmark of a great restaurant is consistency. 

Anthony Bourdain himself argues that restaurant food is less art than craft; meticulously reproduced plate to plate, visit to visit, month to month. 

I imagine it's a tough feat to accomplish. Restaurants pay poorly. Tastes change. Staff come and go. Longevity and quality are tall orders. 

So I wonder whether I caught the wrong end of the King's Tacos curve. 

But first, some context: a few weeks ago, I took my wife out for dinner at KT to celebrate her new job. We both love Mexican food, authentic or not. I'd read great things about this place, and as I review this they still sit above 4 stars on yelp. 

I understand that they moved a little while ago, taking over a former Burger King on St. Clair West, just past Dufferin Street. It's not the prettiest commercial strip, but that's never discouraged us. 

The restaurant itself was half-full around 7:30 on a Saturday night, but hard tile floors and bare walls made noise reverberate like we were in da club. We were seated immediately, and offered a small bowl of fresh chips and a trio of hot salsas ranging from polite sting to full bowel evacuation. 

I mostly opted for the middle-a creamy green with just enough heat to keep me interested; an errant dip into the bowel evacuator while I was pitching woo to my sweetheart was an unforced error. I still ate the chip, to my eternal regret. 

Service was polite but distant and unhurried; we had to call random servers over for cutlery, and napkins, and water, and order-taking, and payment...they did bring the food without our specific request, though. 

Sadness: we attempted to order quacamole to share, but were advised that there was insufficient avocado to mash us up some. There was enough avocado to place inside or mains, so I guess they were rationing the few precious fruits granted them by the corrupt Gobernador. If only I had thought to call Zorro for relief. 

Mains could be summarized as follows: If the left one don't get you, the right one will. My wife ordered a chicken quesadilla. She got a cartilage quesadilla. It went back after a few unexpectedly crunchy bites, replaced by a vegetarian version which was tasty, but something one can make easily enough at home. I ordered enchiladas smothered in more of that green salsa. Mercifully they were free of cartilage. Less mercifully they revisited me throughout the night, seeking egress by any means necessary (I puked. A lot). 

I would never claim authoritatively that I got sick at a given restaurant, but I have small children and thus do not eat during the day, so the list of potential culprits is pretty much dinner or a nature valley lunch box granola bar. 

I award King's Tacos two stars because poor service, problematic food and possible sickness aside it was still a night out with the girl I love."}
{"text":"I love this place.
The pico de gallo is my favorite, and usually me and a friend will split an order of tacos and purchase extra tortillas.
Service is always friendly and helpful - although it can be a little slow when they are super busy., and the food is always really delicious (so long as you like spicy).
I go about once a month."}
{"text":"The new location is a little loud but the service was great and our meal awesome as always. Free fresh chips & my favourite Carnitas in the city. So so good!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and even better food. This Mexican food is actually as authentic as it gets. Just like the best places in Mexico that offer amazing home-cooked Mexican cuisine, this place isn't exactly decorated to be beautiful and 'mexican'. It is a simple and clean decor. The food, however, is simply delicious. I love this place."}
{"text":"My GF and I make it a habit to try out any of the new restaurants that open in our neighbourhood. Generally we go once or twice before something newer opens and our attention is diverted. It takes a pretty solid place to keep us coming back time and again. 

King's Taco is definitely that place. 

The first time we went, we thought we'd split chips and guac and a quesadilla as a starter, and then also ordered a burrito for me and tacos for her. At most places this would have been a normal meal. As soon as they started to bring out the food we started to feel ridiculous at just how much we had ordered. Chips and three kinds of salsa to start, then more chips and a large bowl of guacamole, followed by a large quesadilla, a large burrito, and a plate of tacos with fires on the side. 

We should have packed more of our meal up, but everything was so tasty that we left uncomfortably stuffed and still had half our meal in take-out containers. 

And all of this came to under $40. 

My only small complaint is that the food does seem a little fatty making this a more occasional indulgence for us."}
{"text":"Overpriced, flavourless, all brown slop. I ordered lunch, spent over $10 on one taco, left hungry and wont be back"}
{"text":"A couple of months ago, my brother and I decided we wanted to find the best Mexican food in Toronto.   We wanted real Mexican food, with real portion sizes.  

We didn't take this task lightly.  We didn't just find BlogTO, see their number 1 and go.  We checked out a ton of different online sources (BlogTO, Yelp, Reddit, Etc...) and poured through not only the articles - but the comment sections as well. 

We tried a couple of places (or had already tried them before our official search), ranging from corporate chains, local chains, small independents and upscale joints. 

Finally we went to King's Tacos.   

Loved it. 

Awesome service.  Probably my favorite tasting Mexican food I have had in Toronto, and the portion sizes were unreal.  I left food on the table - look at my profile pic - that doesn't happen. 

At one point my brother knocked his pop off the table (the food took up so much space) and within seconds two servers had it cleaned up and a new pop for him. 

The three sauces that came with our meal were totally on point.  We got some huge plate of different meats that you use to make your own tacos.  They kept the warm delicious tortillas coming!   

I for one can not wait for this place to reopen!"}
{"text":"I love love love this place! Always get their tacos ya vas, and try other stuff too. Always delicious and the service is friendly and attentive. I can never finish a whole plate for my self, but I do not mind I love tacos for leftovers! 

Their guac is average, and the chips in my opinion need more salt.. but I do like an excess amount of salt on everything."}
