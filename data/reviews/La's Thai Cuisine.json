{"text":"Eat here fairly often and food is always consistently good. Casual dining room and also great for takeout."}
{"text":"I had a vegan Red Curry (hot), with extra veggie rather than tofu, along with spring rolls and it was excellent.  Additionally, the girls working at the front counter were incredibly congenial and pleasant to talk with.  I would definitely make my way here if you want some nice Thai food."}
{"text":"First time here. Thanks to Yelp we found this new little gem! The Creamy Crab Puffs were so delicious & the Yellow Curry was full of flavor. The waitress was so sweet & the service was great. This is my new go to for Thai food for sure!"}
{"text":"Great service & amazing thai food. Just glad a super yummy Thai food finally in the neighborhood !! Go try it you'll be glad you did. All veggies fresh & flavorful. And friendly service. Met the daughter of the restaurant she was pleasant & very involved in making this place a success!!  Loved my red curry & fresh rolls along with hot & sour soup was just perfect in flavor & just the right level of spicy!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit. I ordered the barbecue chicken over vegetables. It was lukewarm and the chicken was dry. My husband ordered the wings which were small and fatty. We were disappointed in the quality of the food. I guess they need time to get their act together."}
{"text":"La's Thai has consistently good Pad Thai, has never messed up my order, and has a friendly staff.  Their other dishes are good too, but I keep returning to the Pad Thai.  The only thing I don't like, but you might, is that the yellow curry has pumpkin in it.  As I eat at La's a few times a month, I'm rounding up their rating to 4 stars.  If I get La's Thai cravings, they must be doing something right."}
{"text":"By far the worst pad thai I have ever had. This place is anything but authentic. I have been sick since I ate it. Pad Thai is traditionally made gluten free if its authentic, after four of five bites I could tell their pad thai was not authentic (god knows what was in it) and I am suffering the effects of eating it a few days later. I am allergic to wheat and never have had an issue as I always order pad thai it's a safe go to dish. Maybe there other dishes are decent but man this pad thai was just awful. I wont be back, there are much more authentic and better thai places in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Great Pad Thai, highly recommended. Surprised by the low price and large portion. I haven't tried other dishes but the pad thai was authentic and tasty."}
{"text":"I know good Thai food And this place is awesome. My husband got the yellow beef curry and I got the red salmon curry. It was very tasty and the waitress was really sweet. I will definitely go here again. The fried banana with coconut ice cream is great too."}
{"text":"Yummy - best way to describe the food here. Fairly authentic and they will spice it to your taste level if you ask. My favorite dish is the Red Curry with Beef (spice level 8) while my family loves several different stir-fried noodle dishes. Very friendly owner and staff. Service is fast and efficient. Wonderful neighborhood restaurant that is highly recommended for both eat-in and take-out. One of the very best Thai Restaurants in the Phoenix metro-area !!!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this new location. Longtime customer of their first restaurant (Hayden and McDowell) and very happy to have this second option. Food is delicious and freshly cooked to order.One of very few places that will actually spice it up to your level. Have always found the wait-staff to be efficient, courteous and very attentive. All our friends who we have introduced La's to have also loved the restaurant and is now amongst their favorite places to dine in or take-out. Can't wait to go back!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Having lived in Bangkok and living with a Thai partner, I have to admit I'm a bit picky when it comes to Thai food.  I came here one night with Alex C and we ordered an insane amount of food.  The deboned and stuffed chicken wings were definitely the highlight.  Everything else was above average compared to other Thai places in town.  Portions were generous and the quality of ingredients quite high.  The Spicy Basil would have benefited from more basil to compliment the perfectly cooked tender beef.  The BBQ chicken was disappointingly bland and the sauce it was served with was too sweet and not what's traditionally used.    I was expecting the food to be spicier after reading the previous reviews.  Next time I'll have to ask them for Thai spicy."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant craving mainly Thai iced tea. Luckily they just started being open on Sunday's for lunch! Had Thai iced tea which was perfect, as well as the green curry with beef and the Orange chicken. The green curry was very tasty, a little more on the spicy side (I asked for mild) but still felt like it was quite hot. So I take it as if they're more authentic with their spice. Orange chicken was nice and crunchy and flavorful. The service was attentive and friendly. I would definitely come back to this place and recommend to others."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and stopped here on a weeknight.  I eat Thai food a lot and this was excellent.   Pineapple curry was delicious, with beautiful chunks of salmon and pineapple and carrots. Vegetables and tofu and garlic sauce had a really great, light and flavorful sauce.   Tom kha kai was perfect.  Service was smiley and quick.  If I lived here I would be a regular."}
{"text":"Their food is great, both dine-in and take out.  Speedy service for the people that have a short lunch break.  I really enjoy their sweet nut curry.  Their kung pao, cashew nut, yellow curry are good too.  Look forward to going thru the rest of their menu.  Very nice people working there too.  Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Food was good! Service was bad.   Pad Thai was really good. Pretty large portion. The level 3 spice was good if you like spicy."}
{"text":"La's Thai is one of my favorite restaurants. This is some of the best Thai food in Phoenix/Scottsdale that I've ever had. Customer service is always great and you can't beat their lunch specials!"}
{"text":"Perhaps the best Thai food I've in phoenix. Their red and green curries are strong and leaves you craving for more. The noodle dishes are also good. Affordable prices (around 10 bucks an entree) for a healthy portion of spicy, invigorating food. It is a small place, family run, with calming interior decor, not fancy, but intimate and down to earth."}
{"text":"Are you looking for authentic Thai Food? This is the place! I am so happy to have found a tasty, thai restaurant in North Scottsdale. We tried 3 appetizers - all of them are delicious! Thom Yum Soup, stuffed chicken wings, calamari salad - a burst of flavors. Cashew chicken was also fantastic. I can highly recommend this family owned reataurant. Btw. They have their liquor license now :)"}
{"text":"Just ate at La's Thai food. The staff is very nice and even on Friday night it was empty. Why???? We ordered two dinners and both were ordered spicy as we enjoy spicy Thai food. Both had no spice at all. The server said, \"Sorry, I wish I could control the kitchen but I can't\" She then brought us out spices to add to our meals. There is a reason the restaurant is empty! There are so many choices we have here in Scottsdale that finding a place with good food and control over a kitchen should be included! Stay away"}
{"text":"First time at La's & it's my new favorite Thai place. Unpretentious inside, but fantastic, freshly prepared food. Best spicy eggplant dish I've ever had. Also ordered pineapple pork fried rice (sister loved), a chicken & veggie dish for the unadventurous eater, & a shrimp noodle dish that was terrific. Veggie roll appetizer was crisp, piping hot and not oily. Our server made us feel as though our Thai mom was making our first home-cooked meal after a long absence from home. Getting takeout tonight & will be bringing everyone we know. Best restaurant find in ages."}
{"text":"This restaurant is simple but very clean.  The staff is very friendly and prices are reasonable.  The food we ordered,  for pickup,  tasted great!  I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken red curry...delicious...great little thai place hiding in a dead strip mall."}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite Thai place in Arizona. Great food, generous portions and a very friendly staff. Dinner for two for $22 with enough leftover for lunch the next day. I go at least once a week and consistently fantastic. This is our go to Thai place."}
{"text":"La's is my go to place for Thai food, and come here at least every other week or so. I'm a fan of the spicy noodles, but I like all their rice/noodle plates. Also I know someone who can't get enough of their rice noodle soup. It's a family owned business so it's always the same people working, and they're all very friendly and nice. It is a pretty casual place so they can be a bit slow taking your order sometimes, but once you order the food comes out pretty quick. It's usually never crowded so that helps, but they seem to have a lot of pick up orders. I'm also really happy they're open on Sundays now!"}
{"text":"Uneven service. Fried noodles ordered mild spice was on fire! Needed cold water after every bite. Curry salmon was awful, not fresh."}
{"text":"I came because of the pretty good reviews, but it was average in my opinion. I ordered the pad Thai, which came out pretty thick and too sweet for my taste. It's definitely doable in a pinch for Thai cravings, but not my favorite."}
{"text":"Called for take out said it would be ready in 15 minutes, get there said it will be done in a few minutes. Had to be back to work in half an hour, food took about 45 minutes to finish. Food was good though. Don't go if your on a time limit"}
{"text":"Very good thai food. Prices are good, portions are great. We had the phad thai, yellow curry and pad see ew family style. Everything was very tasty and our waitress was very nice and helpful. The restaurant is very small but is great for sit-down as well as take-out. Will be back!"}
{"text":"We love this place! Panang curry is fantastic and loaded with fresh ingredients. My kids love the fried rice. The Thai iced coffee is wonderful! The staff is friendly, and we always get great service."}
{"text":"I was visiting Scottsdale and after a year in Africa, was craving Thai food. It was great. But hot is hot. The staff was very friendly. I will be back when  visiting Arizona."}
{"text":"This is mine and my boyfriend's favorite thai restaurant. We get takeout from here quite often. Love the girls that work there, always nice and friendly and the food is great!"}
{"text":"This little hidden gem of a Thai restaurant on the southeast corner of Mcdowell & Hayden roads (next to the Subway) is simply fantastic Thai food (some of the best I've had in the States, and I've spent considerable time in Thailand), and the we go every two weeks or so. I've never had anything that has been anything other than fantastic.  To start with, the salads are excellent...Larb salad (odd name, I know) is good, the silver noodle salad (the clear noodles really add to the salad), and shrimp salad is our favorite, very simple, but excellent dressing and the shrimp are flavored/grilled to perfection. The pad thai, the most standard Thai dish, was excellent as expected, but the Rad Nar is my favorite noodle dish from La's. For curry, the red is what I see other people ordering the most when there, but my favorite curry is the sweet masaman, and La's makes a good masaman. The pineapple curry is good too, and if it's the available, the seasonal pumpkin curry is unique and delicious.  As to the other dishes, they're all good... but without a doubt, the highlight of the rest of the menu is the spicy salmon dish...spicy salmon, NOT breaded, with vegetables in a dark, spicy sauce is simply amazing...not enough words to describe this. The salmon is crispy, and holds the flavor of the dish. The vegetables fantastic.  To wash it down, the Thai tea is a great deal...$2...where other places it's $3 or $4.  Lastly, the service is good...just a standard little unpretentious Thai spot, with a couple of very sweet little Thai ladies working there... they're friendly and the food is out quick, whether for dine in or takeout.  Great spot!"}
{"text":"Cozy, comfortable, consistently a pleasure to eat here. Oh yes, and the food, it's delicious! A real gem. Check this place out."}
{"text":"The Thai food here is pretty good. The service is your typical Asian service :/ and the Thai iced tea is a great deal. It comes in a big glass and is delicious! For only $2!!  I'll be getting take out from here often."}
{"text":"Excellent service and delicious meal - She was very attentive to the table. Ordered the Basil chicken and Thai chicken soup. Large portions, was able to leave with 1/3 of meal. Makes for a happy lunch tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Wow! Ran across this place as a happy accident. The service was amazing (Lisa was very friendly and helped me with my vegan needs) and the food was outstanding. Everything was very flavorful with just the right amount of spice. I could tell the veggies were fresh and didn't taste like mush. Seriously will be back! Don't pass this place by!"}
{"text":"Food is always good and so is the service. If you didn't know it was there you might miss it."}
{"text":"The staff or owners? here are really nice, service was good but sorry I just didn't like the food.  I thought it was bland and seemed to be made with cheap ingredients?  I would rank this at the bottom of every other Thai place I've ever been to in town.  You can tell when you walk in also.  No one here.  Go to Thai House close by and you will have trouble finding a table."}
{"text":"There's a reason they call them \"pot stickers\".  You're not supposed to deep fry them!  I showed the server a picture of what they are supposed to be and we recommended that they change the special to read \"DEEP FRIED POTSTICKERS\".  Traditional Thai dishes here are ok but chef is taking liberty and stepping out of bounds with the deep fryer.  Made us pay for his snafu that we didn't eat, so we won't go back."}
{"text":"Craving takeout food, this is our go to place.  Curries from the red to the sweet are delicious.  Noodles, my kids love Pad See Ew with beef, Pad Thai and even the Chow Mein.  I really have yet to try anything here that my family and I do not enjoy. And prices are reasonable. Staff is friendly, helpful and service is fast. Should you choose to dine there, the place is well maintained and clean."}
{"text":"I love thai food. Especially curry. I also love trying new places. But this place is not that great compared to other places I've been. We started off with the chicken satay. Which was decent definitely had better. I of course got the green curry. Very very bland. There was actually no flavor at all. I regretfully sent it back because I only had a couple bites (literally two bites no exaggeration). My boyfriend had the chow mein and he enjoyed it.   Our server was very sweet and attentive. However when we got our bill they charged me half price for a full bowl of curry that was barely eaten. I had to talk to the owner because (even though I hate sending food back and causing issues) I thought it was a bit unfair to charge me at all. They eventually honored that and we left a good tip for our server.   Needless to say, I won't be coming back to feed my green curry addiction."}
{"text":"The service was very good - the 2 stars is for the food. I was really looking forward to a great noodle and shrimp dish. Unfortunately the food was very bland and the the shrimp was rubbery with no flavor at all....no spices...no garlic or anything. I hope they will improve."}
{"text":"Great Curry's ( I love their red and peanut curry), the spicy eggplant is excellent. All in all I have not had a bad meal here."}
{"text":"We love this place. The curry is the best, portions are huge and the staff are so friendly. We order from here 3-4 times a month and have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"It was dead when I got there. There was only one couple in the restaurant.  I was about to do a 180, but decided to try it. I love curry and didn't expect much here. I was pleasantly surprised. The yellow curry had a great flavor and you can tell they have fresh ingredients. The carrots still had a slight crunch. The waitress was nice and very casual. Next time I am in town, this will be my go to spot."}
{"text":"Great Thai food at reasonable prices. I've only eaten here once, alone, and got the Panang curry and fresh rolls.  Rolls were crispy and, well, fresh and the peanut sauce was nice and tangy. The dipping bowl was a little small, but they had no problem bringing me more when I asked.  Panang was very flavorful, and at 3/4 on the spiciness level, very spicy. Just enough for me to break a sweat and feel some burn but not so much like I felt I was participating in the One Chip Challenge.  Service was very attentive without hovering, although at 2 on a Saturday there were only three tables of customer.   I'll definitely be coming back and sampling other dishes!"}
{"text":"We were in town visiting and were looking for Thai food. We were pleasantly surprised by this place. Friendly staff, reasonable prices & a lot of food! We didn't wait long for our food at all. If we are ever back in the area we'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is an outstandingly good Thai restaurant. I have eaten here about 3 or 4 times now, and every time the food has been delicious and well prepared. The use very good quality meat and other ingredients in their dishes. It is, in my opinion, the best quality Thai restaurant in the area. I compare it to those really first rate Thai restaurants one finds in Los Ángeles. It's that good. And the prices are reasonable!"}
{"text":"I ordered the pad-see-ew which is like pad thai but with really wide noodles. I found it to just taste peppery and didn't like it much. I'd give it 2 stars for that. But my wife ordered the penang curry and that was mighty tasty. I'd give that 4 stars.  So, I'll just split the difference and give it 3 overall.  A tip: Soda is just a buck, but they bring you a can with a cup of ice instead of filling a cup from a soda fountain."}
{"text":"Just left after being completely ignored. It was 8 PM and they close at 9 PM. We walked in and we were completely ignored. The cook was washing dishes and noticed us standing there. He just ignored us.  I used to eat here all the time but I will never return after being disrespected."}
{"text":"I really like the green curry.  The staff is friendly and prices are reasonable.  The restaurant always looks clean.  It's nice to have a good Thai restaurant in S. Scottsdale."}
{"text":"If you like Thai food you will definitely make this one of your favorite restaurants. Very inviting atmosphere. Dinning area is clean and open. Staff is very courteous and friendly. Food is delicious and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"So glad this is here! Fresh, healthy, and well-priced. Great lunch and dinner spot. Super clean. Friendly service."}
{"text":"The food was excellent! I had the yellow curry and it is one of the best I have had in the valley! I would give then five stars if it was not for when I asked to have my leftovers to go the waitress bought the bag and containers to me. At first I didn't think much about it because she was kind of busy and the only waitress.  But then I realized she was rushing to sit down and talk to her boyfriend."}
{"text":"Love this place -- our go-to for takeout. Our favorites are the spicy noodles w/shrimp or chicken, or the massaman curry."}
{"text":"I'm conflicted. This place is super close to my house, the staff is super friendly, and they always have my to-go order ready when they promise. They've never messed up an order and the food is always fresh.   The problem is I always end up with a headache after eating the food, so they must be using the dreaded MSG.  So if that doesn't affect you, you will totally love this place...but it does affect me, to the tune of raging headaches.  I always get the red curry with extra vegetables and no meat, medium spice. If you're a vegetarian, you'll see they don't have any meatless appetizers, except for the Thai egg rolls (good, btw), with plenty of sauce included for to-go orders."}
{"text":"Great food ambience and service! One of the best Thai places in the area !!!   Will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"If I could rank them lower than 1 star I would. I have a wheat allergy, i figured I'd give them a try since Thai food usually uses rice/rice noodles. I ordered the green curry, asked the server again of the noodles were rice, took a few bites ... The flavor was great, but the noodles had an awfully soft texture. I called the server over and and again asked if the noodles were rice and she said let me check. Whoa!!  She came back out of the kitchen and said they are WHEAT noodles, not rice like it says on the menu!! The she says \" ya, we need to change that.\". YA THINK!  I walked out, hopefully I won't get too sick. So far my face is swollen and numb, my neck and shoulders are numb and I can't wait to see how I'm feeling tomorrow!  I am so angry!!  Huge mistake, a lot of people can get sick from eating"}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service. Panamanian curry was perfect! Ginger pork was excellent! Great service ( thanksLisa!) Will return for sure"}
{"text":"This place really is great -- but it is HOT!  The medium is not for the faint of heart.  My sis and I went Friday -- got the Larb (which I will agree should be ordered w/out the fish sauce) and the spicy basil chicken and green bean dish.  Both were great, and the medium pretty much burned off our tastebuds, and we love spicy!  I would most definitely recommend this place -- just be prepared if you order your food medium and up!"}
{"text":"This place has such great food and portions! I had their lunch special and I had to box half the food home. The chicken wing appetizer was so good and so was their pad Thai-spicy (which was actually spicy unlike other Thai restaurants). Their Thai tea was also delicious! The waitress is super nice and attentive and their decor is also so beautiful! Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Absolutely blown away by the great service and delicious food!!! Will be sure to come again soon:)"}
{"text":"La's has the best Thai curry in Phoenix/Scottsdale.  The veggies are always super fresh and the owners (one big family) always offer friendly and fast service."}
{"text":"Any cultured individual will enjoy La's Thai Cuisine. Only egocentric and ill-mannered people will label this mom-n-pops restaurant as inadequate, because their provincial ignorance cannot comprehend authenticity in comparison to commercialism. The meals are deliciously fulfilling and the staff are sincerely benevolent toward their customers. TIP: order the yellow curry with chicken, Rad Nar with beef, and don't shy away from requesting a second bowl of sticky white rice. Simply put: divinely delicious!"}
{"text":"I found this wonderful little restaurant a few months ago and enjoy stopping in when I'm in the area. Their peanut curry is delicious and so are their egg rolls. Service is fast and you can be in and out on a lunch break."}
{"text":"Delicious and clean thai food. Very nice people who own the place. Decor was clean and well appointed. We loved the Pad Thai, the Coconut Milk Soup, and their Green Papaya Salad. There was virtually no one there so service and food was fast. We will definitely be adding La's Thai Cusines as a new favorite!"}
{"text":"I practically live within walking distance of La's, and enjoy getting takeout a handful of times per month.   My favorite dish is the peanut curry (panang) with chicken. I'm a wuss when it comes to spicy, but I always order at a medium spice level. I'll be drooling by the time I'm finished, but it's just so darn good!  I've also tried the red curry, green curry, spicy eggplant, tom kha gai, and pad Thai, and everything is great. The portions are definitely large enough to make two meals/servings.   No matter what time of day I call, my order is always ready in exactly 10 minutes. The girls who answer the phone and work the counter are very sweet and polite."}
{"text":"Las Thai has been my goto take out for the past 6 years. Love this place. I'm pretty picky about my Thai food since my mother in law is Thai. It's almost a 5 though My favorites include the chicken larb, chicken satay, huge fresh spring rolls, basil beef, and seafood stir fry.   The service is extremely fast. 10-15 minutes tops to get your food.   All the employees are very nice and have been for years."}
{"text":"The Thai food was definitely above average and the service was excellent!  The restaurant is large and probably the most modern of any Thai restaurants I've been in, but the food seemed authentic.  Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I am so excited that my favorite Thai restaurant, LA's Thai, finally opened a restaurant in North Scottsdale.  I had the eggplant and chicken dish, which was the best food ever! My husband had the yellow curry with pumpkin which he loves. We will always default to La's Thai in north Scottsdale from now on!  How could you go anywhere else!?"}
{"text":"We just came upon this place by accident,it's not the best location in terms of drive by and seeing it but it's worth finding! The service was amazing and the food was just as good , prices are very affordable and good size portions. The pad Thai chicken that was delicious and my wife had BBQ chicken on a bed of steamed vegetables, that was so good. If you like Thai Food I would definitely try this, it's seems to be a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Huge fan! The Panang Curry is my favorite. I graduated spice level the more I went in. Thai spicy is now a must! Soups and appetizers are really good as well. Priced well and the staff is always great."}
{"text":"Searching for an authentic Thai place and I think I found it.  It was a very clean environment so much so that I could smell a veiled hint of bleach when I tried to sit at the table by the window (enter, left)  I moved to another table but I least I knew that they follow proper sanitation procedures.  I also noted that the male cooks had hair nets on--- a good thing since hair in food is not a good thing.   It was an attractive setting and the young lady who greeted us was super friendly.    We ordered the fried tofu as an appetizer which arrived with a delicious peanut sauce.  Tofu is pretty cheap so a $6.95 sticker price for tofu was a little high or am I the one being cheap?   We also ordered the pineapple fried rice with chicken.  We ordered it Thai Hot which is the Super Bowl of hotness!   They let you pick a number to reflect the degree of spiciness.  Once you are in the Thai Hot zone, there's no going higher.  (I don't think!)  I ordered number 26 (or 27) which is ground chicken with green beans and veggies.  It was really good.  Everything was delicious and perfectly cooked.   Service was attentive and friendly.   This is the place where I am going to get my Thai fix from now on."}
{"text":"First time here, lady was supper nice...I'll let u know how good it was later...But I'm hungry and if it's good I'll be back...I tried spicy eggplant and fried banana with coconut icecream...All the people are are very nice, so I hope the food is good too.."}
{"text":"You're right G! You did find a goodie...  It's a great little joint with FANTASTIC food. The service was fantastic and while it's definitely in a \"shady looking\" strip mall (what's new we live in AZ) Everything from the salad to the entrees was delicious... although yes, it was a tad much spice when we ordered the medium level of spicy... Definitely check it out. It's yummy!"}
{"text":"I have visited this restaurant a few times now and it has always been a great experience. The Thai Fried Rice with chicken is the main dish I always get, and it is delicious. The only area for improvement I can think of is regarding the service. If the restaurant is super busy, the service can get really slow. The staff who works here is always pleasant and friendly though. If you're looking for a great Thai restaurant I would definitely recommend checking out La's."}
{"text":"this place is awesome - both the green and yellow curry are great, and i love the thai iced tea!"}
{"text":"La's is one of our go-to Thai restaurants in Phoenix. Their Pad Thai is some of the best I've had in the area.   The place is relatively small, I wouldn't suggest bringing a large group here (more than 8-10 people). The service is usually quick, and the owner & her daughter Lisa are very sweet! We end up chatting with them almost every time we come in."}
{"text":"Ummm. One word delicious!  Authentic and fresh. My husband and I went on a rainy day and sampled a few items on the menu and enjoyed each bite. I recommend the yellow curry and silver noodle salad an absolute must along with anything else they are dishing up."}
{"text":"This place is so damn good! Seriously the best peanut sauce and fried tofu I've ever had and the peanut curry was outstanding. All this was complimented with a very personable waitress with a sense of humor, Lisa! I will definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"My first time eating Thai food and La's Thai Cuisine and it did not disappoint!   Thai food has always been on my list but I never was intrigued enough to go out and try it until now. I'm glad I did because its absolutely delicious! We went during lunchtime on a weekday afternoon and the place was packed! After eating, I can see why. The portions are huge and cheap. What more can you ask for?  We were given an ordinary salad (ice burg, carrots, and tomatoes)  with a very sweet tasting vinaigrette. Didn't really enjoy it because it was too sweet for my liking but it was free so I shouldn't be complaining [: It took us a long time to order because I am a very indecisive person and everything sounded so good. They had Chinese type dish on their menu which I try not to want because I want to try Thai.   We end up ordering a peanut curry with chicken and pad thai with tofu. The peanut curry came with rice and the pad thai came with a mix of lettuce and cabbage. Both came with a vegetable eggroll. We asked for medium spicy which was a little bit too spicy for me because I can't tolerate it too much but medium was enough spicy for my friend. Next time, I would definitely go mild.   How it work is you pick your dish then they ask you to pick your protein. I think its between beef, seafood, chicken, tofu, or vegetable. Then you pick your spice level.   Oh and we ended up ordering mango sticky rice for dessert. Sweet sticky rice topped with coconut milk and a side of mango. It was delicious! My friend said it tasted like the one he had in Thailand and when we spoke to the owner, he said he makes the sweet sticky rice fresh everyday [: (I liked the black sweet rice more and my friend likes the white one but whichever one you order should be fine cause they are delicious!)  Overall we enjoy the food very much. I can't wait to try other Thai dishes from here. Only downfall is I live so far away but I found out the owner lives near me out in East Mesa. Poor guy. Commuting must be a pain. I would definitely recommend this place. Now I think I'm brave enough to try other Thai places.  Thanks La's Thai Cuisine for giving me such a good first experience!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here on a Sunday evening around 7 after seeing reviews on Yelp and we were both pleasantly surprised. Im not sure we would have come here because of where its located and getting into the parking lot is not the easiest. You either need to enter from the back of the plaza or u-turn at the light and turn into the gas station next to it.  We were greeted and sat as soon as we arrived, handed our menus and ask if we wanted anything to drink. Only 2 other tables were occupied at the time so service was very good. She promptly came back and took our order. We ordered the Egg Rolls, Coconut Soup, Green Curry and the Pad Thai. Everything was great and very tasty.  The only thing I thought was that the Pad Thai was a bit too sweet and over cooked.The reason for the 4 stars. My boyfriend loved everything.  We are both looking forward to coming back so we can try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Ive had two things from here.   Spicy Basil Chicken: Meh.  Didnt really taste like basil at all, save for when I actually got a basil leaf in with my chicken bite, which was like three times.  Flavor lacking, but it was definitely edible.  The chicken was cooked wonderfully. Peanut chicken:  Fuck you, La's Thai cuisine.  It was chicken rolled in peanut butter.  I am not kidding.  I ate a glob of peanut butter with chicken.  It was chunky peanut butter too.  No other seasonings could have been involved.  Pretty sad about it, drenched it in Siracha and soy sauce to no avail.   I will not be eating here again."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time the food was terrible I ordered a steak and vegetable dish that was mostly celery and cabbage it just tasted like celery. I tried to send my food back and order something else. The owner wanted me to pay for both dishes. He threatened to call the police if i didn't pay for the awful food he served me. DO NOT EAT HERE!. There are plenty of thai restaurants in town go to one of those"}
{"text":"What a great surprise, Came in for a quick little lunch and I was wowed.  No Scottsdale has missed  a good Thai restaurant and I think this bills that space"}
{"text":"Having just moved to Scottsdale, I decided to try a couple of nearby places. My cousin (sweety) was in  the mood for Thai, and on this stormy night, it was close to where we live. A cute little place in a non-descript stripmall, The first thing we noticed when we walked in was the heat. As in temperature...nothing gets the meal off to a bad start when you can't dine in comfort. Even though I'm hot (lol), I ordered the Tom Yum soup. for 4.25 its a big bowl with 2 shrimp swimming in a zesty, SPICY broth. I ordered the soup Med-hot and that was plenty hot. YUM!  After sipping the soup, our server took requests for dinner, we started with another appetizer: Larb. The flavor was very good, just the right amount of mint and other secret spices....but the mountain of lettuce it is served on was perplexing. Every Thai restaurant I've been to serves Larb with Iettuce leaves, so one can make it a wrap, this was a nice twist on the presentation, but I prefer the more traditional style.    Here is one of my pet peeves at a restaurant....Why, for the love of God do servers find it necessary to bring out the appetizers followed immediately by the main course???? By the time I'm finished, the main entree is cold! Common sense, folks!  The green curry was the best dish of the meal, fully of artery blocking coconut milk, this baby had ooomph!  Hot, savory, filled with tender beef and lots of veggies!  The pad thai was average at best, I sensed no love in this dish, just a pile of noodles...no distinct veggies, no crunchy peanuts on the top...no scallions either. The taste was better than the looks, I'd give it a C+ if i was forced to grade.  Good news is that they are open until 9 and take plastic, bad news; no beer/wine is served. We brought our own sensing that we would be out of luck in the beer/wine dept and were told we were not allowed to drink it as they don't have a BYO license. I didn't know there was such a thing. Phoenix is nothing like Chicago as for as a preponderance of BYOs. I wish it were. Oh well that is another discussion for another day.  The service was efficient, too efficient in my opinion.  I would definitely come back, but ONLY for take out, where in can eat at my own pace, have a beer with dinner, and dine in the air-conditioned comfort of my own home.  There are other Thai restaurants in the area, I'm anxious to compare."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, never been disappointed.  My first time, I told them I wanted my curry dish spicy....never again.  Tasty but I was sweating like crazy after wards.  Very good thai food for the buck.  A side note: the dipping sauce the spring rolls come with is fantastic.  Overall very delicious place."}
{"text":"An unassuming storefront Thai restaurant that is small, but quaint.  It was my first time here but have passed it many times.  I will return for the flavor alone.  I usually judge thai restaurants based upon pad thai (if you can't make that dish well), but could not pass up drunken noodles.  I arrived at 7, only one server but food arrived hot and fast.  There was a clean bathroom and good cooks.  I will return to try again"}
{"text":"Authentic Thai food. I've never had any better. It's a small, non-chain restaurant. Try it. I have eaten here for years."}
{"text":"Very good & authentic! Some of the best curry I have ever had. You will like this small family-style place."}
{"text":"This is only the second time I've eaten here but it was great. I got the Pad se ew, a friend got the pad Thai and they were perfect. I ordered it 2/5 spicy and probably could have gone 4/5. I though I could spice it up later with chili if i wanted. The service was great. While busy the food expediter lady spent a few minutes talking went over and above with her hospitality and service. My friend ordered a Thai tea and it looked so good I got one to go. It was the best I've had.  I highly recommend everything."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times and it never disappoints. Started with crab and cream cheese wantons and excellent choice; so hot (from fryer) could barely pickup, but couldn't wait for the goodness. Second was the Thai fried rice with tomatoes and cucumber - excellent as were the pan fried noodles. If all that wasn't enough, we order TWO orders of orange chicken (our favorite) and it came at the end which was perfect, since it's as much a dessert as an entree. Sweet and perfectly fried with a light batter that is golden and delicious. Will continue to return many times as it always meets expectations."}
{"text":"Very friendly. Excellent service. Excellent Satay with peanut sauce!! Yellow curry was really good too!! OMG the fried bananas with coconut ice cream and honey sauce was divine!!We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"A friend (westside) and I (north) met at this La's location, hoping we'd found a good split-the-difference spot on the way to a southeast valley event. We did, but it didn't turn out to be La's. Read on.  I presented a Local Flavor certificate. The manager insisted it was only for the other La's location. (Funny, the address on the certificate was 1495 N Hayden Rd, Scottsdale, AZ 85257. Didn't even mention the other location.) But wait, there's more.  He also insisted it had to be printed out, not presented on my phone app. (Also funny, this wasn't in the \"fine print\"--invisible rule?) Keep reading.  So we left without ordering and went next door, to Queen Greek. Had a lovely meal and friendly service. Agreed we had found an ideal meeting place for heading southeast. It could have been La's. But it's not."}
{"text":"I love this place. I have seriously eaten here once a week for five years. I always tell everyone you have to try their version of Yellow Curry. (It has pumpkin in it!) and a Thai Iced Tea. The Staff is super sweet.  - Jason ;)"}
{"text":"In town on business and stopped here for lunch based on prior Yelp reviews. Friendly service and a lightening-fast salad starter helped mollify my tummy when the lunch itself ran a tad slow. But BOY! This is one of the best Thai currys I have had ANYWHERE! I had a red curry/medium spicy chicken with pumpkin (seasonal) that was just the right spiciness and creaminess, without being starchy........you just wanted to keep eating after you were full.  I was truly bummed that I couldn't take the leftovers back to the hotel with me. Sigh.  Will come here again if I am back in the area.  Or just dream of that curry sauce......"}
{"text":"Great Kung pao. We were well taken care of by all the employees. Will try the \"tai\" level of spice next time. Glad we found this place."}
{"text":"I like this place. Their to go portions are pretty small in comparison to their dine in plates. If you're going to eat here dine in!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is always excellent and fresh.   The red curry is my favorite item and I find myself craving it all the time. The curry has a perfect balance of sweet and spicy and the veggies always have the right amount of crunch. I also love the chow mein, orange chicken and spicy fried rice. The restaurant is very clean and you can see into the kitchen which also looks clean. My food is always ready in about 10 minutes for take out and the service is very friendly."}
{"text":"Chicken coconut soup had great flavor but way too much cabbage. Yum Woon Sen wasn't anything special. Probably won't be going back for seconds..."}
{"text":"This place is FIRE. My girl loves coming here for comforting Thai food. She gets the spicy noodle soup and I get something different every time. We also always get fresh rolls and extra peanut sauce... because it's all that good. Anyway, we've never been disappointed. My girl is the most particular about the quality of foods and after reading the reviews we thought to give it a try. Now we go pretty frequently."}
{"text":"Wowee! I can handle spice but my spice level of 3 was high! Yikes. Both Pad Thai and red curry was good but spiceeee! I ordered it to go and the service level was low.  The owners must be out of town. Maybe I should have waited until they returned to eat my Thai food. :("}
{"text":"Always great food, service, clean and friendly. I have tried many items from their menu and have been very pleased. Stop in and give them a try!"}
{"text":"Within the immediate area this is the best Thai spot.  We've tried many dishes and keep coming back for more.  The ingredients used are always fresh.  I would recommend their papaya salad or larb.  Also have tried their tom kha gai, which is a chicken coconut milk soup. My favorite thai soup.  The service is always so nice and the owner is very sweet."}
{"text":"Great Thai food!  We got the Spicy Noodles with Beef, Yellow Curry with beef and the spring rolls. phenomenal!   They only have a spice range of 1-3. We got two and they were inconsistent with the spice level but still good. I wished my spicy noodles were actually spicy.  Thai iced tea was great too!"}
{"text":"Everyone is right, in that for Phoenix,  La's delivers some decent Thai food.  I had green curry shrimp ~ and was careful to ask for \"little spicy\".  Even then still had some kick.  Went there for lunch and the food came out very quick and fresh.  All in all it was good.  I'd go back."}
{"text":"This is the BEST THAI FOOD EVER!!! Seriously it is. (Written by my son, he is eight and enjoys authentic Thai food)."}
{"text":"This is one of the best thai places in town! I work nearby and I know plenty of colleagues that come here for lunch--its always packed! Despite that, the service is great and I never have to wait long to get my spicy chicken red curry on! I love the portions of food for the prices. Lunch specials range from $5-$8--very reasonable for the amount of food you get. I've tried the pad thai as well and its very tasty! The fried rice is excellent as well. I love that their curry never tastes watered down like other places I've tried--theres loads of veggies and can be customized for spice level--though I usually order medium heat."}
{"text":"My husband and I have takeout from here far more often than I care to admit.... Chicken pad Thai!!! Yum! I'm not a big Thai connoisseur, so I cannot speak to the authenticity of this place, but I love every bite and eat takeout from here probably once a week. The lady who owns it is super nice and friendly. They are a small shop so don't come here if you're in a big rush. Overall I love La's and will continue coming here and enjoying the food!"}
{"text":"This place is great!  After many failed restaurants at this location, we finally have a winner.  I've tried all the coconut milk curries and you can't go wrong with any of them.  It can get busy during lunch time.  Reasonable prices and friendly service."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a great little hole in the wall. I've been there 4 or 5 times now since they opened (i think earlier in the Summer of '08). They did a good job of giving the place a face-lift. They are always very friendly and welcoming and the food is fantastic.   So far the green curry is the best I've had, and the portions are huge and the price is reasonable and doesn't get to crowded. I think its a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Best Thai food place I've been to yet! Been coming here for about 2 years now and the family is so friendly and knows exactly what we when to order! The coconut soup with fried tofu is amazing, so are the spring rolls!"}
{"text":"The food is great I have come twice and they just opened so yes the food is really good.   However they seem to be having many service issue that I really hope the figure out quickly.  I will continue to come here but I am not sure for how much longer unless they get it fixed"}
{"text":"I get carry-out often. I love their chicken Panang curry. Very generous portions which allow for leftovers. They are also very fast and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Very good food and attentive staff. Food was fresh and was presented nicely. Will definitely go again.!"}
{"text":"I've been in once.  I had spicy noodles with tofu.  delicious.  I also got a red curry to go.  It was also very good.  My mother had pad thai and took a pineapple salmon curry to go.  win-win-win.  And another win for the thai iced coffee.  Four meals and two beverages for less than $50 and it was all delicious. The portions were large too. I will be back for more."}
{"text":"It wasn't really busy when we walked in but it's after the dinner rush.  Place is very clean and I love the decor.  Server was very nice and the water with lemon was divine.  I ordered the wonton soup and the crispy noodles.  Both dishes were great.  The crispy noodles is on the sweeter side in comparison to other places.  Mind you I'm from Hawaii so a lot of dishes can be sweet but I'm surprised that this crispy noodles was that sweet.  My friend ordered the papaya salad. He loved it.  He gave it 5 out of 5.  I will be coming back. :-)"}
{"text":"After nearly six years of eating here, today was a shocking experience.  I ordered papya salad, and it tasted OFF.  Too fishy, not enough zing.  I sent it back after a few bites, declining for another plate.  Much to my surprise, THEY MADE ME PAY FOR IT.  That's the last of my dollars you will ever receive!  Didn't even TELL me.  Just dropped the check and said sorry the owner says you have to pay becuase you didn't get anything else.  What?  I was afraid to order more after receiving what appeared to be turned shrimp?  So I have to pay for your food I didn't eat?"}
{"text":"This little hole in the wall is quite charming and tasty!  I stopped in on a week night with my mom because she had heard it was good and it didn't disappoint!  The interior was really warm and inviting.  It had a refreshing and clean mix of traditional Thai and modern decor.  The service was also warm, friendly and attentive as one would expect at a traditional Thai place.  The menu had many delicious options for experienced Thai-goers and plenty of more simple options for the faint-of-heart newbies.  We had Curry puffs to start...YUMM!  I tried the Yum Neua, one of my favorite thai dishes.  My mom had the King Prik.  WoWza!!  The food tasted amazing and had a spectacular presentation, with lovely sculpted veggie flowers and pretty plating!  We were very impressed.  My Yum Neua was tasty and refreshing and the beef was lean the way I like it.  The King Prik was prepared in a particularly unique way that gave the dish a special aromatic lemony flavor that really made it stand out.  I can't wait to take my husband to try it!  My mom liked it so much she went back a few days later to have it again.  Although I am visiting from out of town, I hope more people give this place a try because I want it to stick around.  I can't wait to try the Laotian salad next time."}
{"text":"When you can take home Thai food and it still taste like it just came out of the kitchen, that is a 10 for me. The seasoning was perfect on the Thai basil chicken and the Garlic and Pepper beef. Staff was polite."}
{"text":"I feel bad about this, but why, I'm the one who spent Friday night throwing up!    I walked in to pick up my to-go order of Red Curry Chicken with brown rice only to find a woman ordering the very same thing.  She enthusiastically praised the red curry and said that I would love it.  After that and the mostly good reviews on Yelp, I thought I was in for a treat.    The funny thing is, it was really good.  I thought that I found a great little gem.  The curry had tons of veggies and they even had brown rice, I was pleased as punch.  Skip forward to the next morning and I was feeling nauseous, by the afternoon I was in flat out pain and well, I won't tell you the rest.  I can only equate it to that meal, all I had before it was fruit and a piece of toast for breakfast and a Lean Cuisine for lunch.  I started feeling slightly ill that night after my dinner from La's and it progressed steadily from there.  I feel bad because the meal was good and obviously the lady who so enthusiastically recommended the curry hadn't experienced this before.  I wish I could call her and ask her if she got sick too.  Maybe this was a fluke, but I'm sure as hell scared to try it again!     So, if you wanna know if the curry was good- yes it was.  I would have given it 4, maybe even 5 stars, unfortunately ruining my weekend brings it down to 1 star.  I feel compelled to say that the place seemed clean and the employee who helped me was nice, I am sad that I won't be going back.  Just don't say I didn't warn you.  Maybe just stay away from the curry?"}
{"text":"I tried this place for lunch, and don't think I'll be going back.    I love panang curry, and was really dissappointed here.  I liked the heat this curry packed, but the lemon zing was wayyyyy too overpowering.... so much so that I didn't even eat the left overs  (and I always eat leftovers)!!  Furthermore, this place was pretty pricey... for lunch I paid 10+ just for the curry and brown rice!  Try Thai Basil if you're in the Tempe area, their curry is to die for!"}
{"text":"Excellent Thai. I cannot sing enough praise about this find.   The cucumber salad was cut into chunks and was fabulous. Although I love this salad. Normally I find tris salad has red pepper flakes in it. I did not miss them in This salad   Barbecue steak was so tender and the vegetables steamed to perfection. The cilantro jalapeño sauce had me licking my fork. I wish I could buy this in a bottle  Crispy noodles rad nar presentation was amazing.  The vegetables were plentiful and also steamed to perfection   Will come back. I was so impressed with the food I texted photos of what was served."}
{"text":"Wow, that is great panang curry!  Impressively wonderful smell too.  It is criminal that I've not managed to make it back in a while.  It just isn't on my normal route."}
{"text":"They must have changed their cook as what I got were nothing remotely close to what the reviews said or looked like the pics posted here.  I got Thai fried rice and pad Thai.  They were both dry and it almost seemed like they were made/fried without any oil.  Besides that, they didn't taste like Thai food at all.  If they keep up with that kind of standard, I can tell you they won't be around for long.  I'm being generous to give two stars.  I'll say one star for the big portion but really, it defeat the purposes.  If the foods taste bad, you wont eat them anyway.  We threw away ours!  I won't go back for sure."}
{"text":"In a scramble on Valentine's Day, La's Thai managed to save dinner.  The plan was for Hottie to pick up Tottie's on his way home... which apparently is closed on Mondays! La's had received good reviews, so he decided to give it a try.  He ordered me the Green curry with Tofu and brown rice, and chicken Panang curry for him. My curry was very tasty, with just the right amount of heat. My only complaint is that I have so many bamboo shoots to poke around it was annoying.  Hottie seemed to be pleased with his curry as well.  I guess my dilemma here is that it was good, not the best I'd had, but certainly decent.  So, do I score them a 3 or a 4? Ugg, this is when I wish yelp let you give  1/2 stars!   Based on the sheer genius of some of their competitors' curries, I'm going to have to go with a 3.  But for what it is worth, in my mind it's a 3.5."}
{"text":"This is a great Thai place.  I enjoy the food very much.  I've tried the curry as well as the spicy noodles.  I can't wait to get back there."}
{"text":"Love the Pik King. And the restaurant staff was so friendly and the place was nice and quiet. I could enjoy my conversations. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Great to have La's up closer to our part of town!  I've been to the orignal store (Hayden and McDowell) and have always enjoyed the food.  Since our favorite Thai place just closed down, we've been needing to find a place to get our Panang fix...La's fills the bill nicely!  One word of caution:  whatever spice level you normally order at a Thai restaurant, subtract one here - I usually get a '4' most places, got a 4 once at the other location - let's just say I'm not as young as I used to be...I get a '3' at La's, and it's fabulous!  Great food.  Great people.  Get you some!"}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food.. love the yellow curry.. I have them add red and green bell peppers and it's perfect"}
{"text":"Very good.  Friendly service.  We always get it to go, so can't say too much except it's always ready and correct when we get there to pick it up.  South Scottsdale staple Thai restaurant.  Delicious Food.  Spring Rolls are really good."}
{"text":"A nice little surprise - glad I gave it a try! Though it's in a strip mall in south Scottsdale, it's actually quite charming inside: nicely decorated with a warm, inviting staff. And since I'm a Panang Curry fiend (seriously I order it most everywhere I go for Thai, especially on a first visit -- it's kind of the bar by which I measure a Thai place), I ordered it here. And I was pleasantly surprised! At first when they told me there were only 3 levels of spiciness, I was a bit worried. I usually order 8 out of 10, because I love it spicy but sometimes \"Thai hot\" can be just a touch too spicy for me. But too bland is dull, so I went with option 3.  Not only was their Panang curry (I got it with shrimp) at least as good as anywhere else in the Valley, the spiciness was deliciously complex, and had a little something I don't recall tasting in other Thai, which added something special to it. Kind of an aromatic nut-like spicy flavor -- just a hint of it -- within the typical Panang curry flavor. The balance of spices and heat was perfect. I would definitely eat here again - though I live on the other side of town. The atmosphere and decor are on the elegant side of casual -- so it's not really a date night kind of place, but would be great for a casual lunch or dinner with friends or even a casual business lunch. The Thai tea was good, too!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Scottsdale area hands down. Chicken & Shrimp Pad Thai and the spicy fried rice are my go to dishes. Super awesome customer service at both locations!"}
{"text":"I'm still new to the world of Thai food, but following a friend's suggestion I opted to try the chicken satay and red curry (beef). The service was very friendly and fast, the restaurant calm and clean, and the food pretty good. They have lunch specials Mon-Fri from 11a-3p, and the portion is pretty large. I went around 2pm and they were not crowded so if you want to sit down and enjoy your food that'd be fine... but you can always get it to go and not have a long wait. I'll definitely be going back and trying to Spicy Basil!"}
{"text":"I have to genuinely give this business a 5 star review. My boyfriend & I were not expecting to walk in to such a noticeably clean, highly modern little hole in the wall when we arrived to La's Thai Cuisine. From the moment we walked in, to the moment we walked out, the service was so homey & caring. The food was fabulously plated & the flavors were all there. We could not stop raving about the service, food, & restaurant cleanliness from the moment we were severed & to the time we got back into the car. Thank you La's Thai Cuisine for thee unexpected exceptional service! Keep it up - we will back!!"}
{"text":"Really good Thai food at an affordable price. Only downside is that the chicken is rather dry in their Tom Kha soup. Otherwise everything is good."}
{"text":"this place is fantastic!  A family run joint with amazing food and huge portions.  La is wonderful, it's her joint.  Her daughter Lisa is an amazing server and aspiring Nurse.    If you know ANYTHING about Thai culture or food, this is the real thing!  I can't recommend this place more highly than the five stars YELP allows!  Keep in mind that level 4 (Thai hot) is HOT!  I like it that way, but if you don't have an iron stomach, stick with 2 Medium!  They don't serve booze, but the Jasmin Tea is served in it's own pot, and is authentic and worth trying, even if  you don't like tea.  The wontons are unique and delicious.  The yellow curry is something you order extra portions just to take home with you.  Park in the back as there is plenty of room.    This place is on the top of my list.   You leave full and feeling good!"}
{"text":"Finally a really good Thai place in the area. There are a few others, but they bend in the direction of Chinese to appeal to the mass. So far tried a couple of the curries - great, traditional flavors. A standout, and you should seek this place out for the amazing fresh (summer) rolls. Great textures, super fresh and perfectly chilled ingredients with a really tasty peanut sauce. Seriously, it's really good - crave-able in fact and worth a trip to try.  The location is a little tough that it's kind of off the beaten path, but easy to find so try them out. Worth it - and I want them to make it for selfish reasons."}
{"text":"This place is close to home and very convienent for me. I have never dined-in and usually grab food to go.    The place is clean and has a good amount of seating.  I haven't dined in, not because it ever felt that I could not, but rather because its close to home and so I prefer to grab and go.  I would try having some food here, maybe to meet a friend if we are on our way somewhere else for the day. =)   I always see a steady flow of people at this location and the food has always been very fresh and made-to-order.  I've had a few of their stir-fry dishes and have enjoyed them all.  They are not the best Ive ever had, but they are tasty and fresh! The portion sizes to go have always been generous and I can often share an entree with my hubby.  I haven't tried the curries, but I plan to soon.    If you are in the area and want some Thai food, I would give them a try.  There are some places north of here that are WAY more expensive and lack some of the authentic flavor you get from smaller mom and pop type Thai places.    Before I forget, I like food hot, however they can adjust or omit heat, simply ask. =)"}
{"text":"Excellent Pad Thai and Yellow Curry with chicken. Had  dinner here for the first time and it was a good experience."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant! The food is awesome, but its the service that puts this place over the top. It's family operated so you know they care about each and every customer. I will not go to any other Thai restaurant in AZ, La's is my absolute favorite."}
{"text":"Much like their South Scottsdale location, this one is great as well.  I always get the Pad See Ew or the Orange Chicken, both are excellent dishes.  Service is phenomenal as well, since its a family that runs the place and really cares about the customer!"}
{"text":"I just moved a few blocks away from this restaurant. I love Thai food and curry is among one of my all time favorite foods.  I decided to try it after reading the mostly good reviews. I got my food to go but stepping inside, it was quaint and smelt delicious.  I ordered the yellow curry mild.   I have to be honest, it didn't knock my socks off. I've had some phenomenal yellow curry and the yellow curry at La's was just okay. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. I definitely want to try some of their other dishes but I won't be rushing back for their curry anytime soon."}
{"text":"Fantastic hidden treasure in Scottsdale. Great food, wonderful service, and a place we will be back to."}
{"text":"It was my second time here last night.  We had the friend wontons w/ sweet and sour sauce for our appetizer, spicy noodles and salt and pepper beef.  I liked the first two dishes but the last one didn't have much flavor.  It didn't help that my bf ordered it spicy so it was a bit too hard to eat.  I really liked that red curry which is what I ordered the first time I came.. the beef salad was good as well but I had better beef salad somewhere else.  All in all, decent food, good service, and I will definitely come back to this place."}
{"text":"We have gone to this restaurant three times in the last year. We had the Pad Thai and spicy basil pork. The Pad Thai (5/10) was very ordinary and the shrimp added a tinny taste to the noodles. The spicy basil pork was very good(8/10). Went Fri night at 5 PM and it was deserted. PROS: clean but simple building, large portions, comes out fast and hot. CONS: Food is delivered to table with no followup. The few employees there, were chatting in the kitchen. No Alcohol of any kind."}
{"text":"Love their fresh tasty food and friendly service. I ordered a delicious Pad Siew with beef and the rice noodles were perfect and tender. We also ordered a very spicy green curry that was creamy and yummy. The Thai basil chicken was perfect. They even do a sweet and sour chicken (not very Thai but super good) where the breading on the chicken was crunchy and tasty.   Was in with friends last night on a very quiet Tuesday night. Only one other table there. Didn't stop us from having a good time. Kop khun kha!"}
{"text":"I eat here once or twice a month. I love the red curry and soups. Never had a bad meal and I've tried a large portion of the menu. Service is top notch and the waitress always remembers I like the red curry and a root beer. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is their inconsistency with the spice... I order medium spicy and sometimes (not very often mind you) it I'll be melt your face hot, haha. I still eat it, I like spicy, however my stomach doesn't care for it much in my old age."}
{"text":"Frendly staff, quick lunch service with average flavor and quality. They obviously prep the food ahead of time for fast service buy I would rather wait a little longer for fresh food. The prices on their website are not current so expect to pay a bit more.   For this place to stand out they either need to lower their prices or prepare each order individually."}
{"text":"Yummy, fresh and authentic Thai food. Atmosphere is lovely too!  Had the yellow and green curry. They were both delicious. This is our new Thai favorite!"}
{"text":"Solid Thai food near my office.  Haven't been here in a while ordered the stuffed chicken wing appetizer it was boneless and was actually a great dish.  Also the beef pra-ram, it was decent, a little heavy on peanut sauce.  Good service."}
{"text":"Great Thai food in south Scottsdale. Excellent grilled thai beef salad (Larb) and the standby chicken panang. As spicey as you want it!"}
{"text":"I have ordered take out from this place three times so far. Great quality food for the the price. Their chicken spicy noodles and wonton soup are delicious."}
{"text":"Ordered take out for first time right before closing. It was really fresh and delicious. I ordered the wonton soup and spicy noodle with tomatoes...loved it. Will definitely be ordering again, highly recommend."}
{"text":"LOVE this little place!   So fresh and spicy... The food is always delivered hot and fast. We stopped in at 1pm before going to the airport and we were outta there by 1:40.   GO THERE!!  It's a must!!"}
{"text":"Ginger Delight, Silver Noodle soup, Red Curry, and the Basil-Chile sauce dishes are all good."}
{"text":"I ordered the Massaman Curry. Wow. This is the best flavored peanut curry that I've had. The peanut paste/flavor is apparent and I haven't been able to find that for awhile. The spice was just right too, not too hot but a little kick. So satisfied with this, I would come back just for this dish. Expensive but big portions."}
{"text":"Great food and staff was very friendly. We ordered the green curry , fried rice and orange chicken. Delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food in large servings, plus the free small salad was a nice touch. I was hoping they served beer so I could get some Leo or Chang but still a good lunch."}
{"text":"I love La's. The food is always bomb, the owners are so nice. The musamun curry is my favorite!"}
{"text":"The staff was pleasant and the food was decent, but the service was sloooow. We arrived at 12:30 on a Tuesday and waited about five minutes for a table. It was another five minutes till someone came to take our order and bring us plates of salad. They were 1) out of coffee and 2) out of spring rolls. Ten minutes passed until the waitress brought our drinks. Our food arrived at (no exaggeration) 1:15. I'm not a big fan of waiting 45 minutes for just-ok Thai food. We won't be back."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai restaurant in Scottsdale. I eat here 2-3 times a month and has not yet had one bad meal. Thai fried rice, drunken noodles, and pads thai is amazing. The crispy egg rolls are not too greasy. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"La's occupies the former Pho Tay Do space though they have done a great job of updating with wood paneling and paint. The Mr and I love Thai food so it's been on our radar for some time. So after finally trying it we've decided it's our new favorite Thai place.   The elements are working to their benefit.. friendly service, great prices and large portions of high quality ingredients. We started with 2 salads, huge mistake. The salads are so large that we could have just split one but no.. we ordered the Larb (ground meat salad) as well as the Yum-Woon-Sen (ground meat and glass noodle salad). Just a heads up, if you don't like fish sauce be sure to ask them not to use it. We also asked for them to be hot.. you'll have to love spice cause these are HOT!!.. I had tears running down my face, it was so spicy! Awesome!! Both salads were tasty just make sure you ask about the fish sauce.  We also tried the Fresh Rolls.. you know the drill, rice paper housing noodles shrimp etc.. these were very fresh and tasty though the peanut dipping sauce was phenomenal! Then paired with the roasted chile powder added a complex smokiness to each bite.. Ill be going back for these for sure!!  Entree's.. the Mr ordered Pad Thai, while very very good it was still just pad Thai.. I ordered Kang-Kra-Ri which was a yellow curry with tofu, coconut milk, pumpkin, potatoes and onions.. oh hell yeah! This was one of the best curries Ive had in a very long time! Silky smooth creamy goodness!   You know us.. we over ordered way to much food which was alright here cause now we have lunch for tomorrow! Woohoo! Im such a porker!"}
{"text":"La's was a \"hole in the wall\" type restuarant with a quaint atmosphere. They give you chicken and shrimp with pad thai- typically you just get either or. The lady who served us was so nice and everything was delicious. They gave me so much Pad Thai- I have leftovers! I plan on going back sometime soon!"}
{"text":"This is a nice alternative to the nearby Thai restaurants in the area. The ambiance/decor is great as well as the food. I really like that the lunch menu has a variety of choices and can't wait to try more of them out in the future."}
{"text":"I've probably eaten at 20 or 30 thai restaurants in CA, AZ, and TX. This is as good or better than anyplace I've been, including 5 star places in LA's thai town. Crazy good food, outstanding service, and really authentic recipes. I highly recommend the green curry, papaya salad, and spicy noodles."}
{"text":"The reason why i gave them 4 stars is that I called to place an order for pick up at 11 am, when they opened. I just ordered sticky rice and they told me it would be done in 15 minutes. When I got here 20 minutes later it still wasn't done. I was waiting there for about 15 minutes.   The sticky rice was perfectly cooked and it is refreshing to because of the mango slices it comes with. The Thai ice tea hit the spot in the Arizona  heat.  The staff was friendly. The proportion size was good. It was enough to make me full, I even have left overs. The food is priced well, I spent  $6 on sticky rice and thai ice tea amd got 2 meals from it."}
{"text":"Wanted a some good Tai close to house. This place is really good. Coconut soup was very good, pineapple fried rice was tasty and spicy. If you like spicy get medium, I like a little spice and medium was too much for me. But the I think Del Taco hot is super fiery. Prices reasonable and everything was made to order coming out piping hot. Wife got chicken curry, very tasty.  This will be a regular stop for us so close to home."}
{"text":"This is a nice local dive place. I pick up food here about once a month/ pretty much always the peanut chicken curry (amazing). They always ask \"how spicy\" and I always say NOT AT ALL- it's still ALWAYS SPICY. So if you can't handle spicy- don't go here! The portions are huge- one meal usually feeds me for 3 meals- so it is a great deal. I never stay to eat there because it's super small inside.... like I said \"local dive\" feel. It's not fancy but has a lot of character. Everyone who works there is SUPER friendly!! I would say it's some of the best Peanut Thai I have had. They're known for their pad Thai- but I personally wasn't thrilled with it. It's worth a try- but don't make it a first date kind of place ;)"}
{"text":"What a surprise!  Had lunch special today...Pad Thai.. spicy...food was very good...large portions with Calamari ..  the spice was perfect... abundance of vegetables...I will definitely be a regular.."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try La's for a while, and I was pretty excited when they opened up a new location not too far away from my apartment. They have a good variety, standard Thai restaurant stuff! I got one of my all time favorite meals, tofu with red curry. The peanut curry sounded good too, but I decided I'd rather have red curry!  It was very tasty curry, I am not too picky when it comes to red curry, but sometimes the tofu is too tough or too mushy, it was just right at La's. I got it mild, there was the perfect amount of spice for me. Not too terribly spicy, but just enough spice. It was really flavorful too. I gobbled it up so fast. I loved the pot the rice came in too, it was cute. Not bad prices either, standard Thai food prices. So glad I have another nearby Thai restaurant to visit, going to take some will power to not get take out every week."}
{"text":"My first experience here and it was lovely. The quality and flavor of the food was amazing. I had green curry and pad Thai and I couldn't decide which I liked more. The server was friendly, helpful and sweet and the ambiance is clean and charming.  Can't wait to return to try more delicious dishes."}
{"text":"Just did takeout for the first time here. Salad rolls were fab. Pad Thai is extremely bland. They also didn't put the Thai custard in that I asked for 3 times when I called to order, again repeated I had ordered that when they handed me my bag when I showed up. It's okay, wouldn't go out of my way for this again though."}
{"text":"Scraping the bottom of the barrel! That's how I felt whilst having lunch here.  My pet peeve is when chicken emanates this rather undesirable flavor that comes from eating chicken that has been through a process of freezing and thawing.  My meal was exactly that. I ate a portion of the chicken and then abandoned it.  This experience was further exacerbated by service that was pathetic at best.  So, Sayonara!!"}
{"text":"I've loved everything I've ordered so far at this new Thai restaurant! The staff is great and very accommodating to our wishes.  So far I've tried their Pineapple Fried Rice, Spicy Eggplant, Red Curry and Mixed Vegetables with chicken and tofu. All Delicious!!! Give this place a try... you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"The larb is so, so good here. Very spicy (upon your request) and not oily or greasy at all like other Thai joints. Everything I've ordered here has been stellar. I only wish there were more veggies in the spicy flat noodle dish, but they don't skimp on the meat!"}
{"text":"Their food is consistent ON TOP of delicious and that goes far in my book. They have one of the best larb salads and their red curry is sooooo good when ordered Thai hot!   Be careful when you ask for Thai hot because they'll trust you know that you're asking for a delicious but fire burning dish.   I also love their noodle dishes like pad se ew and drunken noodles but the noodles tend to be over cooked or something because they break apart when you go to grab them with chopsticks.   FYI I've always taken out so that might affect the food a bit."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years. It is consistent. I have always had pleasant experiences. One time I brought my mother here and she wanted fried calamari for an appetizer. PROBLEM. Fried calamari was not on the menu. The waitress was accommodating  and prepared my mother her special request. I always get the fresh rolls. I love the taste of the crisp basil and the delightful dipping sauce. A great change from the deep fried rolls. I suggest the red curry seafood with rice noodles (instead of plain rice). YUMMO!!! And it's enough for 2 meals!! If this place delivered I would be ordering weekly!"}
{"text":"I'm pleasantly surprised that La's is still in business... they are usually empty when I come in.  I've ordered mostly take out from La's over that last few months... and I've been extremely happy with quantity, quality, an cost!  My latest order was the mixed veggies, add eggplant, light oil, and medium spice - yum!  I also had one order of the fresh summer rolls with shrimp.  Yum!  I love both these dishes because they are tasty and light... I will continue to order from La's again and again... I hope that one day on a future visit, they will be packed.  They deserve it!  Craving thai cuisine?  Head over to La's!"}
{"text":"The short: Tasty Thai, very friendly service, and a clean, well-lit, comfortable, and quiet strip mall space.  The long: La's Thai is just south of the gas station on the southeast corner of Hayden and McDowell, and there's plenty of parking in front and behind the complex, with a handy backdoor if you're in the back. We were greeted by some very friendly young women and told to pick a table--plenty to choose from at 7 pm on a Saturday as there were just a couple of tables taken and a couple of people ordering takeout (more came in as the night went on). Decor is a little generic, but comfortable and interesting, with a few of the tables sporting some pretty woven cloths and some carved wood art on the walls.   We had the fresh rolls, satay, stuffed chicken wings, Pad Thai at medium heat, Panang curry at medium heat, and white sticky rice with mango (purple rice was an option, but our server said she favored white, so we went with that). The fresh rolls were going to be my step-daughter's entree, but she's allergic to cucumbers, and I was a bonehead and forgot to ask if the rolls used them--of course they did, and our server offered to take them away and bring something else for her. We decided to just have her eat the satay as her entree while the rest of us used the fresh rolls as our app. We ordered a Thai tea, iced tea, and young coconut drink (it came in a tall can that served two) to drink. All the beverages were tasty.  All the apps came together, including the spring rolls kiddo had ordered as her entree, which was fine because we switched her meal around, anyway. Everything was very good, although I was a little baffled by the big scoops of either cabbage, lettuce, or both that accompanied every dish except for the stuffed wings and Panang curry. I initially wondered if the stuff was a garnish, but there was way too much of it. It was fine with the satay, and we ate bites of cabbage with the chicken and the delicious peanut sauce it came with, although that sauce strangely started to congeal a little bit as the meal went on. That didn't affect its flavor, though. The satay chicken was wonderful--tender and moist, slightly sweet and aromatic with spices. The lettuce scoop didn't make sense with the fresh rolls, which were already stuffed with greens. The peanut sauce that came with the spring rolls was even better than the satay's, and yay, it stayed completely liquid! Neither of the peanut sauces were sweet (I swear some places use Jif peanut butter), and they had that nice umami flavor with a slightly sour edge that I love in Thai peanut sauce. The fresh rolls were, indeed, fresh--lettuce, pops of flavorful herbs, glass noodles, crunchy chopped cucumber, and fresh, chewy wrappers. We were divided on the stuffed wings. An interesting idea--a dense pork filling in boned, fried, full-size wings (not drummettes!). It was well cooked and the chicken skin had a nice crisp to it, but the filling, and thus the whole dish, was just underwhelming.  I liked the Pad Thai, although it was lighter on veggies than I'm used to; but it's exactly as described in the menu: \"Small rice noodles stir-fried with shrimp, chicken, egg, green onion, bean sprouts and peanuts.\" La's is a very noodle-centric dish, but the noodles were perfectly cooked--not gummy, clumpy, oily--a good chew without being undercooked, and loose so each noodle came up separately. The proteins were also perfectly cooked--not dry and over cooked like a lot of Pad Thais I've had. As for the heat--I couldn't find it, so it was more mild than medium. I think the Panang curry got all my chili.  The curry was thick, rich, and packed with peanut flavor, again without being too sweet, and overall tasty. The veggies were cooked well with just some crunch to them, and the chicken was again tender and moist. It came with a big side of rice--plenty to make at least two servings of food.   We all loved the sticky rice with mango. Such a beautifully simple dish--a generous serving of sweet rice coated with coconut cream and two big hunks of sweet, fresh yellow mango; this was one of the best versions we've had--every component just right.  Overall, while there are plenty of good Thai spots in the area, I wouldn't pass La's Thai if I were in the area."}
{"text":"We went to this place for lunch and we're definitely fans. I ordered the Green Curry (dinner portion) with seafood combo and my partner ordered the Red Curry (dinner portion) with seafood combo. We both loved it! Great portion size for a decent price. It came in a bowl loaded with seafood and veggies (I don't understand when restaurants serve curry on a plate...). It also came with a small salad (lettuce with a tomato slice... a little lame but a nice thought) and big bowl of rice for us to share.  Overall, awesome experience. The ambiance is casual and the service is friendly. We'd go back... but we'd also try other places in the area.   They lose one star because the seafood didn't seem fresh. But then again, we're in Arizona.... Also, that little salad...  A solid 4-star experience and a great choice if you're looking for some yummy Thai food in the area."}
{"text":"There chicken yellow curry is to die for. Be careful on asking for the hot spice level. It was super spicy. I could barely eat it but the taste was so good, I stayed tough to finish it. Ask for medium spicy so it would be just right."}
{"text":"This place is freaking awesome. Amazing quality food, and great service. I am so tired of sub-par Thai restaurants that just add peanuts to some type of noodle and serve it. This place is a welcome addition to the Scottsdale Thai food options."}
{"text":"Finally a great Thai restaurant in the area! My wife and I really enjoyed our dinner! This is a family owned and operated business with very nice decor the best Thai food in the area. Would diffidently recommend giving them a try!!"}
{"text":"Without YELP, I would have never tried this place.    In other words, thank god for YELP!!  This is seriously one of the better Thai places in town and it's worth the drive from N Scottsdale.    The last time I had Thom Kha Gai soup this good was in Thai town near Hollywood.  The coconut broth was a serious harmony of flavors:  sweet, creamy, sour, tangy..  OMG, it was sooooo good!  I asked for it spicy & I loved they way they added sliced thai red peppers to the soup instead of chile powder as they would at other places.  I did the 'tilting' of the bowl to get the last spoonful.  Yes, it was THAT good!  I had a hard time choosing my entree, but ended up with the Spicy Wide Noodles with Shrimp..  The one thing I noticed is that everything tastes good because the flavors are blended together so well, like they put care into cooking a delicious spicy dish, rather than  just a flavorless spicy dish.  Anyways, the noodles were perfectly cooked and the shrimp seemed fresh and abundant.    Anyways, I'm hooked & can't wait to go back.  It was empty when I was there last time so I hope my 2cents will help to get the word out!"}
{"text":"What can I say .... LOVE, LOVE THE PLACE! Food is delicious. I get the yellow curry there when I go. I have brought many friends here to try it out . They all equally loved it the same."}
{"text":"I have been here several times, love it! typical Thai food, great service and good prices."}
{"text":"Love this place. Service and food are always on point! This has quickly become a regular spot for us."}
{"text":"Fantastic, fresh and very clean. Much better quality than Thai house across the street. I cannot stress that enough- you cant just go anywhere for Thai. My only complaint (if there is one) would be that I wish they used a different assortment of mushrooms in the thom ka, not just Bella mushrooms. For me, that makes the soup!"}
{"text":"We stopped in on Friday night on a whim and it was a great spot. Service is quick and the food is fresh."}
{"text":"Best Thai we have experienced in the valley. We ordered basil chicken and Pad See Ew with shrimp. We loved the flavors. Totally balanced and delicious. I did feel the amount of green beans in the basil chicken dish took away from the flavor of the dish. I will ask next time for less green beans and add in a different vegetable. The restaurant is very comfortable. The service was fine. There was one other table of people at the time. We plan on returning and will bring friends."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in the East Valley for my money... I've always taken it to go and it's always phenomenal.  Green curry, red curry, yellow curry, panang... You really just can't go wrong.  Plus, once received some sage words of wisdom from the owners daughter, bit like a scene out of a rom-com, but I wasn't mad at it."}
{"text":"I'm eating it right now!! So good!!! Thai hot spicy sauce, peanut sauce, noodles, chicken, veggies...damn, it's like a cornucopia of amazing flavor just having an awesome party on my plate! Two nights in a row. I give this spot my highest recommendation. Also, the girl up front, Lisa is SUPER cute! A+++"}
{"text":"I came to visit to this Thai restaurant because I was nearby and starving. I decided to place an order for pickup: beef curry, chicken pad se ew and shrimp rolls. I wasn't a big fan of the rolls because they were literally a full size shrimp wrapped in an egg roll wrapper, but the curry and noodles were good. I recommend to come and visit if you are in the area. The employee that greeted us was really really friendly too. I always appreciate friendly service."}
{"text":"I've been to La's Thai a few times, since I work within walking distance, and haven't been disappointed with anything I've tried. They have a large menu with good lunch specials, friendly staff, and the food is good.  My benchmark for a good Thai place is Massaman Curry and La's version is excellent. If you like peanut sauces, this is a definite must try. The Thai iced tea is delicious as well.  It can get pretty busy around lunch time, but I've never had to wait too long for a meal. The dining area fits more people than you'd expect and manages to still feel like there's enough room.  I'm working on getting some co-workers to try it out next time I go; one can only handle so much cafeteria food."}
{"text":"La's is a family-owned and operated Thai place in the Commerce Center retail strip. The owner and her daughter and super friendly and accommodating.  The food is always hot and fresh. I have had better Thai, but this does rank pretty high among east valley Thai spots. The pad thai is decent. A bit sweet, bit still tasty and spiced to order. The Thai iced tea is a little bit wimpy, but still good.  The panang curry is nice.  Spiced to order and with the protein of your choice, this is one of my favorite dishes.  I will continue to come back to La's often."}
{"text":"Horrible service at this restaurant. We went in after looking at the yelp review but was really disappointed. Lisa, the owners daughter had an attitude serving us and would not pay attention to what we asked for. Initially we were okay and nice even though the service was so delayed. We asked for a lime for the beer and it took her more than 10 mins to bring it and it came with the appetizers. We had to take the lime out of our water glasses and put it in the beer. Moving on to the food, the ice tea was \"different\" which we told her that it does not taste like ice tea and the response from Lisa was \"our things are different\". Then the food came and I would even give food 1 to 2 stars and we still had SMALL appetizer plates. We started eating and realized that we need larger dinner plates so we asked Lisa for larger plates and she said \"okay\". 5 mins later we still waiting for the plates while the food has been sitting there and we look at the counter to our surprise Lisa is doing something on the calculator.....totally ignored what we had asked for or they forgot what we asked for. We went up to her and asked for plates as the food has been sitting and she had a lot of attitude with worse customer service saying \"I was caught up OKAY, we are BUSY\". We asked for the owner and Lisa response was \"I am owners daughter and my mom is in the kitchen....she is busy she cannot come\" ..... she was very rude very unprofessional and no courtesy or customer service ABCs what so ever..... if you don't want to ruin your Friday night or any meal......please don't go there. They don't care about their restaurant or food quality or customer service. Can't believe how they are still in business."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today with my wife.  Really enjoyed it.  Great food and the service was excellent.  Would have liked the chicken to be a little more moist but other than that it was great!"}
{"text":"I truly love this place I have only been here a couple times, but they have the best Pad Thai that I have ever had! Also the server Lisa is amazing!! This place has the best atmosphere and food"}
{"text":"Good stuff! Friendly service by La. Clean restaurant. Ordered Pad Thai with Chicken/hot very good and not greasy. Tom Yum = yummy! Will eat there again."}
{"text":"Excellent food and customer service! We've been here twice and the dishes we ordered each time have been so tasty! The waitress remembered us from the first visit and was so friendly and personable. Highly recommended and we'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Best authentic Thai in the area. Lots of vegetarian options with tofu subbed in. Curries are delicious and so are the noodle dishes! Thai tea can be subbed with coconut milk for a vegan option. Good size lunch portions.  So good...flavors are wonderful!! Our favorites here: masaman curry, pra ram, sweet and sour, pad Thai, prik king, and yellow curry!"}
{"text":"The best Tom Yum soup!!! The masaman, Panang, and pad Thai is incredible as well! GREAT food!"}
{"text":"I stopped here today after hearing so many good things about this place from my fellow clinicians.    It is solidly decent Thai food. Nothing that blew my socks off, but still quite tasty.  The lunch prices are better elsewhere, but I wouldn't let even that stop me from going back to try it again.    I would have given it 4 stars, but I'm still holding on to it until another dish on their menu is as good as I've been led to believe."}
{"text":"My experience was... interesting. Let me start by saying (for the people who wont read everything below) that the food is good, is it amazing/best I ever had? No, but its solid Thai food. & I would probably come back again (partly because there isn't great thai food in Scottsdale IMO).   Food ordered: Pad thai -- no shrimp, only chicken (medium spicy), Mixed Vegetables w/ chicken (medium spicy), order of chicken fried rice (medium spicy), order of egg rolls (comes with 4 -- & they're actually spring rolls, no meat) = $42  Anyways, so I call on Sun night 6PM at Sky Harbor parking lot for carry out & they say 15 min -- we get there 10 min later & wait inside. Inside there are two couples & one group of 4 sitting & also a couple in front of us at the counter waiting for carry out. While we are waiting one of the women sitting at the table was just furious that that the lady who was doing the take out -- bagging the orders & cashier was also taking care of all of the tables (they must be under staffed) so she was yelling out loud \"PUT THEM ON HOLD\" to the employee every time someone called for take out... it was just so awkward. Then when this lady finally got her food she was like \"OH MY GOSH ITS RAW, THE VEGGIES ARE RAW\" and mind you, this is a tiny place, you can pretty much hear everyone's conversations if you wanted to. So this is so awkward, my boyfriend & I were like errrrrrrrr get us out of here ASAP. So this lady was out loud complaining, the female lady who apparently worked the whole restaurant was running around like crazy, it was just a busy place. So our food took more like 25-30 minutes rather than the 15 min we were told.  But at the end of the day, the food was good. We had enough to get a few meals out of it. But the experience was interesting, I don't think I would ever eat in because I can just tell service is slow, unless you come not during the dinner rush. And for carry out, allow more than enough time. Also, it was a little pricey.. 4 tiny spring rolls were like $8? Should have been like $5 max,"}
{"text":"I give 3 stars for the service and 2 for the food.  The phat Thai was very blend it's really need more seasoning and it would be nice if they add peanuts and fresh cilantro to it to bring the flavor together.  My friend had Kung pao vegetables and it was good, but not great.  The Thai ice tea was good (I requested not to sweet).  The waitress was very nice and friendly which is good.  I like the overall decor is very nice and rustic look, it's a potential."}
{"text":"It is a little bit small of a downer, but the service and the food was outstanding! Our waitress, Alba, did a great job! Our food arrived in good time and was full of flavor. I will definitely be going back,"}
{"text":"Here over 30 minutes for lunch and still no food.  I came in and it was half full.  Now it is full.  I ordered coconut soup and chicken curry.  I specifically requested the soup first.  Everything came out together.  In my book this place is a disappointment based on service alone.  The coconut soup was bland. The chicken curry was supposed to be mild and is spicy, with a unique flavor unlike most other Thai restaurants.  Personally,  there are many other Thai places that I would go to."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely horrible. We arrived and said that we needed to be seated. Then the girl said let me clean up some tables and I'll be right back. Another girl came up and tried to seat people ( who arrived after us) before us which was annoying.  Then I went to go to the bathroom to wash my hands and you could tell that the place had not been cleaned. There is a gross stench. When I went to wash my hands they had soap that was watered down as if they were too cheap or lazy to go out and buy new soap. Then when I went to dry off my hands they're out of paper towels which tells me other people probably were washing their hands as well. But there was a roll that I found eventually.  I go back to sit down we're looking to the menu and the waitress walks up and just says \"ready?\" Not \"good evening\", not \"hi there\", nothing. Just, ready? I asked for some waters because those hadn't been brought out. She came back I asked her a question about the menu and she says I honestly don't know. You can tell that this place should not be opened yet or at all. So I go to order and the people that were seated after us, ordered after us with another waitress. Their food came out, and that we were still sitting there for a good 25 minutes after their food came out. All in all we were seated waiting for food for 45 minutes until we finally got up and walked out and told the girl just scrap the order. I don't know how a place like this is in business and if I had to bet, I give it a month and a half before they're closed. It's very unfortunate because there is very lackluster Asian food in this area."}
{"text":"IVE BEEN SEARCHING FOR A GOOD THAI RESTAURANT! THIS PLACE IS AMAZING! Their curry is absolutely to die for! Super clean inside, and super friendly employees.   Highly recommend to all thai lovers"}
{"text":"Worst Thai food and service I have ever had. Pad Thai had no flavor what so ever. Was only person in restaurant, should have known better. You have been warned!!"}
{"text":"The food is so so good. The Tom Kha soup is delicious and I'm picky with how curry is cooked. It's clean and relaxing and staff is friendly. I would recommend coming here. I'm coming back to try their wings. Yummy!"}
{"text":"I'm torn about this place. I got their lunch special the other day that includes a small egg roll/spring roll of some kind and for my entrée I chose the red curry with pork. I also got an order of their cream cheese wontons - I think it was around 8 to an order. I got take-out so I didn't sit down but from what I could see, it looked like a really nice/clean place with a good ambiance.  The red curry with pork was AMAZING. So good. So yummy. Exactly what I expect and want from a red curry. Their vegetables were cooked the way I like them in curry - borderline mushy. The pork was flavorful and tender. 5 stars for this dish.  But - both the egg roll that came with the lunch special along with the cream cheese wontons were awful. Just like... Plain awful, nothing about them was remotely good. The cream cheese wontons were the biggest let down. They were supposed to have cream cheese and chives in them, I believe? I couldn't taste any of that though... Just a TON of wrapper and barely any filling. I wouldn't pay 50 cents for 8 of those, but alas, unfortunately I paid around $7 or $8.The egg roll was similarly disappointing and also their dipping sauce wasn't good either.  So long story short - the entrée was phenomenal, the appetizers were terrible. Proceed with caution!"}
{"text":"Came late afternoon. Only a few people in the place but tons of take-out occurred while we were there. Really great Pad Thai, they put it on a bed of cabbage which I stirred all up in and it was fresh and crunch and flavorful. Salad rolls fresh and excellent. The soup was really \"milky\" with coconut/cream. Different than I have had for Tom Ka, but it was okay. Just not the norm, no big pieces of cool roots, mainly some chicken and mushrooms in milky coconut broth, no steaming fire bowl (sigh).  Staff really helpful and friendly, older lady in the kitchen checked in on us. Lunch specials a good way to try everything."}
{"text":"I honestly enjoyed everthing I have ordered here. Pad Thai comes in a huge portion and isn't too sweet. It leaves a good aftertaste. Pad see ew is good and isn't too oily. I have also tried the red curry and thought it was delicious. Keep in mind that many of the curry dishes have coconut milk..so steer clear of these dishes if you aren't a fan."}
{"text":"So I Door Dash this place all.the.time! Oh my gosh, it's amazing. I always get the red curry and it's so good that I don't want to get anything else. I did try their chicken satay which was phenomenal. This is the best Thai food I have ever tasted. The portions are decent and the prices are main stream. I've been meaning to actually sit down and have a meal here but it's great with my busy schedule that they offer delivery. Try this place- you won't be disappointed :D"}
{"text":"I've been for lunch several times. Very flavorful curry. Pleasant staff. They seem to do a busy carry out business. Lots of close parking. Doesn't look like much from the parking lot, but nice inside. I will definitely be back to explore other options on their menu."}
{"text":"The food here is a 5star!!!   The spring rolls are fresh, delicious, and frankly the best I have ever had!  The #19 for lunch (peanut curry chicken) was delightful!!  Great to get a salad then lunch portion that fills you up completely!   I took off one star for the unfinished window area....  no window coverings/looks incomplete... now I know they just moved in 3.5 months ago and this will probably get fixed but it will not stop me from visiting frequently!  Oh and difficult to find....  but worth the effort!"}
{"text":"There is a really great Thai place a little closer to me than this,but it's a little pricey.  So I was curious to see how this place is.  It's well worth going about 1/4 mile further than the 'other place'.    Same sized portions, same delicius flavor.  Is it as 'nice' on this inside?  No, but both are located in little strip mallish areas and are great for a pop in lunch/dinner or especially takeout.    I got my old stand by:  Tom Kai Gai soup and it was delicious.  I'm not a fan of mushrooms and they kept them outta there!    Chicken Panang.. outstanding.  I asked for 'medium' heat and it was just that. There was enough there to give a little kick but not enough to be uncomfortable.  I don't like my nose running when I eat.  The portions were enornous, enough so for two more meals and all for $14!"}
{"text":"Sat down with a reservation for 3, then waited 69min for appetizers. We graciously moved from our table to another table to help them make room and seat larger groups (TWICE). After 69min we received our two appetizers, shrimp and tofu, both fried dishes which take 3min to cook (forget the fact that we asked that they be served with our main meal).  To be fair, the appetizers were pretty good, but we were starving which probably made them taste even better.  Since we were told 4 times the food was \"coming right out,\" we waited another 13min (82min after we ordered) for our four dishes, but still NO FOOD :(.  We then politely asked for either our meal or the check, whichever was ready, and they QUICKLY brought the CHECK!!! (LOL)  We paid $23 for the soda, 2 waters, refilled once, 2 apps, and a 20% tip because we don't blame servers for poorly run restaurants.  No discount offered on the check, no visit to our table by a manager or owner, no coupon for future use to encourage our return.  Yes, we heard a few \"I'm (so) sorry, food is coming right up.\"  The only food that came right up was for the large tables of 6 and 10, that we got up and made room for.  I would have expressed all these FACTS to either a manager or an owner, but we never saw one.  So, if you go here, and things start to go long or wrong, and you want to eat, then either: 1) DON'T be the patient, gracious, and nice guests we were, or 2) Go next door to Pastries N Chaat, which looks really good!!"}
{"text":"I am so happy I can finally say I have found my favorite Thai restaurant in Arizona.  From the moment you enter, you are greeted with friendly smiles and kindness.  Their sticky rice was perfectly steamed (my mom and I have always struggled to steam sticky rice just right, so we know a good batch when we eat it).  They had green mango salad, which I had not seen anywhere else.  It was perfectly spicy, sour, and delightfully gingery.  Unbelievable.  It could even make me forget about my former favorite, papaya salad.  The pad thai is very flavorful, a more traditional dry-ish sauce than the wet, sticky messes you get at some Americanized places. I could be wrong, but I thought I even tasted a hint of shredded dried shrimp in the sauce.  My husband loved his yellow-curry marinated grilled half chicken, which was a steal at only $10.  We can't wait to go back, even if it's a farther drive!"}
{"text":"I recently offered to treat a co-worker to lunch and asked him for a suggestion. He highly recommended this restaurant and, since I had not already tried it, I was eager to do so.  I ordered two curry entrees with chicken, one red and one yellow, two full portions of rice, and two orders of Sticky Rice with Mango.  Pros: The portion sizes were generous, as was the quantity of chicken and vegetables, and probably more than enough for one person.  I had the yellow curry and the chicken and vegetables were tender but not mushy. The consistency of the broth was rich with good depth of flavor, very satisfying, and the seasoning was perfect for me.  I ordered Spicy Level 2 on a scale of 1 to 3. Were this curry to be served in Thailand then I expect the Spicy Level would be a negative number because I found it to be relatively mild. However, considering this restaurant is located in Scottsdale I think their scale is adjusted appropriately.  The Sticky Rice with Mango was among the best I've had in southern Arizona. This was due to the fact that the portions of rice and mango were larger than usual for local Thai Restaurants I've tried before and the rice was very good.  Cons: The only concern I had was the tab for lunch came to about $20 per person, which I thought was a little pricey.  At the same time, I did order plenty of food and considering that Thai food in southern Arizona is often somewhat disappointing I would say it was worth the treat."}
{"text":"I've been to Thailand, and in my opinion this was the best thai restaurant in Scottsdale. My husband and I used to come here and do take out at least once a week when I was too tired to cook dinner, aka make a giant mess.  We would have never thought of to come here on our own if it wasn't for yelp. It's a very small restaurant, in a small strip mall. The kitchen consist of two Thai ladies and the counter is worked by one of the lady's daughter.  Just order these dishes and you'll be good. They do have more daring dishes but I'm pretty vanilla.   Thai Green Curry with Tofu  Pad See Eew - Beef  Drunken Noodle - Beef or Chicken Green Papaya Salad Chicken Satay - Well done Orange Chicken"}
{"text":"Regular here - pad thai wth chicken and shrimp is consistently an 8/10.   Today they heard 1X order instead of 3X over the phone but managed to rush two more orders in a matter of 5 minutes upon arrival!  Highly recommend adding this Thai restaurant to your weekly rotation."}
{"text":"I love their Pad-See-Ew so much! I love when noodle dishes have a 50/50 split between noodles and veggies/meat. So delicious!  Also the pineapple curry with salmon is a really unique treat that I can't stop ordering. La's is my favorite spot for Thai take out."}
{"text":"I'm glad we decide to try this place.It's just around the corner from where i live and the food is Great.We generally order take out from them, i have never had any complains.The food is Fresh and ready on time.The portions are a good size and everything is reasonably priced.  Some of my favorites are  Pad Thai(rice noodles with shrimp, chicken, egg, green onion, sprouts and peanuts)  Chow Mein(egg noodles with meat and mixed vegetables) Yellow Curry(shrimp/chicken in a yellow curry paste mixed with coconut milk, onions, potatoes, carrots and pumpkin) Garlic and pepper Shrimp Fried Shrimp(batter fried served with a sweet and sour sauce some carrots and broccoli)  I think they also have a few lunch specials.This place is definitely worth a try if you have some Thai food craving on a chilly winter evening.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"This location has always been some sort of Asian-inspired restaurant for as long as I can remember. They never seem to last, and quite frankly they've never really been all that good. It seems like FINALLY this has changed with La's Thai!   I'm not sure how long La's has been here, but mom has been ordering takeout from this place pretty regularly for quite awhile now and always has good things to say about it. A couple months ago when I was home for a visit we tried ordering from here, but discovered they were closed on Sundays. When I was here over the Christmas holiday we tried again (the day before Christmas Eve) and were successful.   My mom suggested that we split some spring rolls and Panang curry. Now, I'm a big eater and was skeptical about one appetizer and one entree being enough to split, but my mom insisted this would be more than enough food, and per usual she was correct! This place gives you a TON of curry...and it's delicious! Split between two people we still had leftovers. There are a a lot of vegetables (that taste fresh) and the chicken was tender. The spring rolls were yummy as well, and surprisingly not too greasy.   When I went to go pick up our order the place wasn't that big, but I actually thought it looked pretty nice and I wouldn't hesitate to dine-in with a few friends. The food is affordable and if the other entrees are the same portions as the curry, you certainly get your moneys worth.   One thing I have to say about this place (and for me this isn't a bad thing at all), is IMO the curry is a bit on the spicy side (but I like mine spicy!). I generally find Thai curry to be less spicy than Indian curry and I ordered \"medium\" (with the other options being \"mild\" or \"spicy\") to balance things out for me and mom (who has been know to find \"mild\" salsa to be spicy), and it had a good kick. She later informed me that she normally orders mild from La's, but she was able to handle it.   When I'm back visiting the 'rents, I'll definitely come back to La's Thai!"}
{"text":"This is a cute little Thai restaurant in the Savers plaza. The interior is warm and inviting, and the menu offers various curries, rice dishes, stir-fries, soups, salads, and noodle dishes. I tried the green curry with tofu. It was made in a short amount of time and was well seasoned with plenty of vegetables and tofu. The sauce was the right consistency and had a lot of flavor. After talking to our server apparently they put spinach in the curry sauce which makes it healthier! The curry was served with a lovely fragrant jasmine rice.  Service was warm and friendly. If I'm in the area this is a good choice for Thai food."}
{"text":"Take out.  Pad Thai needs oomph.  Crab wontons we're not as good as in the past.  Maybe Sunday night is not our night.....m"}
{"text":"I had the yellow curry (medium) and my wife had the spicy basil.  Excellent food. Lunch special brought us salad and a small eggroll. Flavors are outstanding and the meals came extremely quick. A+for service and food prep!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Thai place.  The inside of the restaurant is gorgeous and very clean.  The staff is friendly and attentive. And the food... it's beautifully presented and tastes even better than it looks! We will definitely be repeat customers."}
{"text":"Great classic Thai food done right. The hot and sour soup and wonton soup were both great, as was the pad thai.  Lisa was our server and she did a fantastic job. really sweet and great service. it's pretty hard to find good Thai in Scottsdale so we're stoked about this place!"}
{"text":"Pad Thai was super good! Service is so nice and I just like how little the place is and how they all multitask as servers and cooks."}
{"text":"Orange chicken and beef with broccoli is the best! Also, the sauce with the chicken satay is the best!"}
{"text":"The food wasn't great. There was too much cabbage in everything. The customer service was horrible. The waitress brought us our food and never checked on us because she was eating. We had to go up to ask for our check and she gave an attitude. Then we had to go back to actually pay because she wouldn't come get the check because she sat back down to eat and had an attitude when we payed. I would never recommend this place to anyone that values customer service or Thai food that's not loaded with cabbage"}
{"text":"First time having Thai food and it was amazing! La's Thai Cuisine was definitely wonderful restaurant. The decor was lovely, it was very clean, and the food was good. One thing that I feel should improve to make this a 5 star restaurant is they need more staff. Another server would be great to help with drinks, food, and etc. Other than that I would definitely recommend this Thai restaurant to anyone looking for good Thai food."}
{"text":"What a find! Pleasing decor, delightful staff, and superb food. We tried the whole steamed fish, stuffed and covered with mushrooms in an oyster soy sauce. With a side of steamed rice it was more than enough for two and really fairly priced. Can't wait to come back and try other dishes."}
{"text":"Do not let the logo fool you. This is restaurant dishes up quality Thai flavor. This place is probably one of the better Thai places that we have dined at in the Phoenix metro area. Granted, they might not serve Tom Yum in a hot pot (that I saw anyway and if they do then I must try it) but their dishes are superb. The flavors are distinct and authentic. Our red curry was delicious with a pleasant Thai basil undertone. The Mahi had a unmistakably bright lemon grass kick which made it clear to me that they must marinade their fish (quite well). Don't forget to try the mango sticky rice after your main course. We will definitely be back often since this is the most authentic in flavor that we have experienced in the Scottsdale area (aside from Cha Da). The service is great as well! My taste buds give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"The yellow curry is a MUST HAVE! Just enough sweetness, but didn't overpower the other yummy flavors.   The ambience was relaxing and calm. The service was a bit slow, but the food made up for it!"}
{"text":"Best Thai I have had in the valley. It is a small place and you would miss it if you weren't looking, but definitely go out and find it. The staff was friendly and the food was great and flavorful.  You won't be dissapointed."}
{"text":"Good Thai! And very reasonable prices, orange chicken is delicious.  This place is great for dine in and take out"}
{"text":"My nieces, siblings and others were in town recently. I heard of this place on yelp so we came here for dinner one Tuesday evening. I ordered the seafood red curry and it was a good choice. The shrimp and everything about it was great except for the pieces of squid. I've had squid numerous times before and sometimes it's hit and sometimes miss. The portion was enormous and there were gargantuan bowls of steamed rice with it.  The curry sauce had so much flavor, and I had to take half of the meal home in a container. All the family members really enjoyed their meals as well. The server was very friendly as well.. The following week I went back for their lunch, but found lunch is hectic there. The server is in a hurry with all the tables and so I wouldn't recommend it during their lunch rush."}
{"text":"This is gold! Everyone cooked perfect, nothing is soggy, and the ingredients are fresh! The red curry is to die for as everyone else already mentioned, and the pad see eiw has so much potential but could have used a bit more sauce..but it was cooked perfect and had the perfect amount of meat veggie noodle ratio. Probably a fluke. Love this place though! Ambience to sit in was cute too. I opted for take out though."}
{"text":"Love the pad thai. Love that it's walking distance from work. Little pricey but too good."}
{"text":"Finally found a great Thai spot! L O V E! Ordered the papaya salad Laos style extra spicy and it was amazing. No complaints. Order was ready when I arrived. My stuffed chicken wings were a bit over cooked, however it was still pretty good. Definitely recommending this place!"}
{"text":"This is good, solid Thai food - not the best I've ever had, but it's very good, for a casual meal. I've never eaten on the premises, but we've gotten take-out from there several times, and the food is always good, inexpensive, and the staff is friendly.  I have not one bad thing to say about La's and definitely recommend it for a quick meal, or take-out."}
{"text":"Picked up takeout from here tonight. They were very nice on the phone. We ordered fresh rolls, papaya salad, chicken red curry and chicken green curry. He really liked the rolls and salad. We both really liked the green curry more than the red curry. He ordered his curry 'thai hot' and it was REALLY spicy. I ordered mine medium. It was prefect for me."}
{"text":"I'm going to keep this short and sweet... I don't like Thai food that much. Not a huge fan anyway. I am giving it 4 stars because that's what it already has. The spring rolls are excellent - very fresh and crispy. A little more flavor would be my only complaint if you twisted my arm to come up with something to complain about.  The summer rolls are good as well. I had some pad thai, but the peanut smell prevented me from enjoying it. It's probably good if you like that sort if thing. I couldn't tell you. I will try it again - it's really close. Next time, I'll have a look at a menu and actually pick something out."}
{"text":"My first time here.   Great hole in the wall Lao style Thai restaurant.    I ordered paht ki mao lao style hot, drunken noodles.   First off, the portion is huge and its tasty.   I'm particular on my spice and they nailed it.   The waitress was helpful.   I will definitely come back to try their Som Tum, (green papaya salad) and other entrees."}
{"text":"I really love Thai food and we decided to try one of my bookmarks. Been bookmarked for awhile so I was excited to try La's. When we walked in it wasn't too busy and very interesting. Had a little Asian flare to the ambiance.   We started out with Fresh rolls and potstickers. The fresh rolls comes with two rolls cut in half. I really like these fresh rolls a lot. Had cabbage, carrots, and little shrimp inside. I could taste a slight taste of vinegar. So this was really good. Really enjoyed it with the peanut sauce.   We also got the potstickers. You get your choice of pan fried or steamed. We go pan fried which is basically deep fried. I thought they were ok. Not great and a little small in size. The sweet and sour dipping sauce was really good.   I ordered the crispy noodle rad nar with added chicken. The dish was displayed really well but seemed like there was more noodle than anything else. I think there was cabbage, carrots and chicken. It was pretty good. Soaking the noodles in the juices really helped the dish.   My wife got the Chow Mein with chicken and I was able to grab a few bites and it was pretty good. Not great but good. My son got the beef and broccoli. He noticed that there was more broccoli than beef but said it was okay. Someone else in our party had the Pineapple Curry and said that it was pretty good. He says that he judges Thai places based on their curry so he thought that it was pretty good.   Our server was very friendly. She was very helpful too. Making sure our food is okay and filling our water glasses. Funny thing is she recognized some of the people in our party and basically goes to school with them. So that was pretty cool. I would have to say that the kitchen was pretty slow. Seemed like it took them an awful long time to get our food out. Not sure why but it is what it is.   So we enjoyed our meal. I enjoy going to a mom and pop places. Just don't have really high expectations but remember it's the food that counts at this place. Enjoy and we will be back to try other items on the menu"}
{"text":"I have been going here for years they are also very good to me. The egg rolls are my favorite as well as the panang. But everything you get from here is delicious and very fair priced."}
{"text":"My mistake for ordering orange chicken, 90% batter 10% chicken, I thought Panda Express was bad, half the pieces were deep fried and rock hard. I always order their basil chicken with green beans which are the bomb! I love this place but this dish needs work!!!!"}
{"text":"I have gone here over 100 times in the last year for lunch. The food is fresh and always good. The service matches the food. I am always in and out at lunch in 45 minutes.   Strongly recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"My wife and I eat here often. La, the owner, has always been friendly and accommodating. The food is VERY good.  I highly recommend you try it out!"}
{"text":"Having lived in San Francisco for 8 years, I know good Asian Cuisine. And finding high quality options with authentic flavors in Arizona at reasonable prices has been tough. This place is fantastic and we order from here AT LEAST once/week! They are family owned and operated...and turns out that due to their success they are opening a second location right off Hayden and 101 on January 4th! I highly recommend the red curry salmon (spice level 2)."}
{"text":"We were visiting from California and staying at a nearby hotel.  My son was craving Thai food so I turned to my Yelp app and found this place. The restaurant is pretty spacious, clean, and the decor was nice & modern. Our party of 4 ordered the papaya salad Lao style, shrimp spicy basil, chicken pad see ew, chicken spicy noodles, and of course Thai iced teas.  Our servers were really sweet & attentive, the service was fast and friendly, and the food was really good. The owner even came out to say hi and she was Lao just like us.  What a pleasant surprise & a nice personal touch! We will def be back the next time we visit."}
{"text":"First time here, had the chicken Penang lunch special, the portion size is nice but the flavors were only average. The dining room is well decorated and spacious."}
{"text":"I am torn.   I used to love this place. It is right by work, so it is super convenient and their grilled calamari salad is so flavorful and filling, that once I take a bite, I crave it for the rest of my AZ visit.  Here is my problem: their food is great and I have really enjoyed everything I've had there, but the last time I was there I got the WORST food poisoning of my entire life. While on travel for work, sick as a dog, not able to even drink water for days, stuck in a hotel room, and losing critical days of onsite work time - my stomach is still not 100%.  So how do I rate this place? On the flavor, I'd give 4 stars easy. But, I can't offer my recommendation in case someone else gets sick. (I had the coconut soup and the fresh spring rolls when I got sick). I did call them the next day and let them know, and they apologized, but that was it.   So... if you want to risk it, and stick with fully cooked food, you may get a nice Thai meal. Or you may go on what I am now calling \"The Salmonella Diet\".  :-X"}
{"text":"Great Chicken Curry. Just be careful if you get the spiciest of the spicy because they don't play around. The fresh rolls are really good to, and they're giant, in fact both portions were real big. All in all I'm a fan and am excited to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Best Thai I've had in S. Scottsdale. Far better than a local competitor who loves Basil in everything. Fair prices as quick service."}
{"text":"Horrible experience! I ordered a mild doh, I hate to complain, as I have been a chef for 30 years, but it was so hot, I couldn't eat it! I had to get up and ask them if they could remake it, I gave them a chance to make it right, they gave me a new dish, without the chicken, that was supposed to be in the dish! When I told  a woman, behind the counter, our waiter said I asked for medium, he didn't speak English, nor did he come back to check to see if everything was ok, very unprofessional, they should have gotten a  clue, when we didn't ask for a to go box, to add further insult, they wouldn't take it off our bill,apparently they aren't interested if their customers would return or not! We will not be returning to their horrible little restaurant! Beware of waitstaff that doesn't speak English! Super dissatisfied! I don't"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Just had it for the first time.   I had Panang and Pad Thai, both dishes were very fresh and tasty.  The service was excellent as well. I highly recommend this small gem.  Take out is available."}
{"text":"Satori to Kaigen! (Enlightenment and Spiritual Awakening!)  1st review.  Nervous and working on an empty stomach, with the only exception being the half loaf of French bread and herb-butter I had consumed prior to dinner. Thinking Asian all day and being an incapable decision maker, I rely on Yelp and the assistance of a small list and a single 6 sided cube with dots on it.  I jotted down 6 prominent businesses, held my breath and flicked a wrist.  A \"2\" brought me to La's Thai Cuisine!  Peeped the website and open til 9:30, score! My eye spotted closing time was at 9:00 though!  Arriving on the scene at 8:49, poorly reverse parking my Honda in two spots because I was worried that they were closed.  They weren't, I was met by a Thai beauty introducing herself as Lisa.  I humbly asked for takeout, my adventure begins with the opening door...  Smells are incredible.  Having thought they were closed, I had forgotten what I was going to order! I rifled through the menu, feeling as if the whole kitchen was watching (they weren't) but she instructed me to take my time; So I ordered a soup, a salad, an entree, a dessert and a side of brown rice. They kindly ask me for my preference on the degree of heat, on each item, I asked for not the hottest but close to the top.  #17  Mixed Vegetable Soup: Stellar  Culinary Thought: Clear, piping, spicy and vegetable packed.   Ninja Eating Plan: Gently lay over white and brown rice, alternately.   # 9   Papaya Salad (Som-Tum): Phenomenal  Culinary Thought: I got shrimp on the side, due to allergies.  This was probably the most awesome experience of the evening.  They even \"fenced in\" the shrimp within a Masai-esqe cage of cabbage, to prevent their oceanic brine from invading the delicate papaya, sprout and carrot forest. Spice and crunch with every munch. Beautiful.  Ninja Eating Plan: Try not to be seen scarfing this down in front of a date, it's that awesome. Fortunately, my sister was only present and she knows I can eat like a pig and sound like one, too.   # 53 Peanut Curry (Panang curry style, comes with rice!): Umami  Culinary Thought: I don't like coconut. I do now. The lemon and coconut milk rises through the savory peanut curry.  Tofu was my protein option, it was done perfectly.  Green beans provided great consistency in this masterful crescendo.  Ninja Eating Plan: Laid over rice, alternately brown and white rice, interrupted by the occasional, gorgeous, curry-only spoonful.     Coconut Ice Cream: Yum  Culinary Thought: I was reeling at this point but I wanted to continue this experience.  As I stated earlier, coconut is not my thing but I believe in giving things a fair try, so I did.  Coconut ice cream is delicious. Coconut pulp, or meat, I still have a texture issue with, but the honey swirl throughout the ice cream made this delectable.  Ninja Eating Plan: Use the cooling ice cream energy to return your body back to normalcy. Perfect coda for the culinary symphony.  I will be back.  I plan to have every dish vegetarian style.  Family-run places are truly number 1.    Overall experience of the Culinary Ninja: PAVLOV  Do you hear the sound of a bell chiming?"}
{"text":"I really like La's Thai, their food is consistent, portions generous, and heat level perfect. They are a bit lacking on atmosphere and lighting, so it's not romantic, just functional. We usually place our order to go. The girls at the register are very accommodating and sweet. This is our go-to place for Thai to go."}
{"text":"Was looking for a good Thai place for lunch while on business. La's has good reviews so we decided to check it out. I went with the Spicy Basil chicken - with the \"spicy\" designation, just down from Thai hot. It wasn't hot at all and it was more like a plate of watery green beans with the strangest pieces of chicken I've seen. Edible but not worth going again. Service came and delivered the food but never came back. There is better Thai here."}
{"text":"Great new Thai restaurant and they do spicy right! (And not spicy if that is your preference). We ordered take out: Fresh Rolls, Egg Rolls, Fried Tofu, Yellow Curry with tofu (Thai hot), Pad See Ew with pork (Thai hot), Orange Chicken (Mild), and Thai Iced Tea with boba. Compliments across the board. We will be returning! They manage to make it spicy and still keep the flavor - impressed!"}
{"text":"I love Laotian dishes, and I was able to get one of my favorite here.  Waitress was great and recommending and pointing out what I might like off the menu. The papaya salad prepared super authentic and delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Good authentic Thai food.  Their menu isn't as extensive as Thai Elephant, but their prices are cheaper, and they are much closer to my house!  Great place to grab some takeout, or bring a friend and eat in.  Good spring rolls, and excellent Chicken Basil."}
{"text":"My fav place!  Delicious curries!  Very friendly staff.  It's casual dining, but I don't require fancy atmosphere in order to have good food."}
{"text":"A very pleasant place with lovely waitstaff, soft music, and accommodating kitchen. The pork eggrolls with tofu skin wrappers were outstanding. They were out of eggplant so we couldn't get eggplant with duck; settling instead for barbecue pork on sauteed vegetables. While the pork was excellent and the peanut sauce we requested was the best I've had, the veggies needed more time in the pan to get some flavor. Certainly worth returning."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Sunday early in the day. Place was clean and quiet. We were immediately greeted and attended to. We ordered cashew chicken and pad Thai. Food was served quickly and was prepared nicely. The pad Thai was definitely the better of the two dishes, the cashew chicken tasted a little more like Chinese food than Thai food. Overall, I give this place four stars for ambience and service but food was average."}
{"text":"I would have gone with two stars but after gagging on the pad thai that smelled like garbage and was so hot it was inedible, I asked for it to be removed and removed from our check.  I was told I had to pay half price for the food that we ordered mild and was served hell-hot.    The restaurant smells of ammonia or bleach or something pungent upon entering.  The waitress was very nice.  The fresh rolls were pretty good but the peanut sauce tasted syrupy sweet.    We won't be back."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch today and had the chicken and eggplant dish as well as the red curry.  Both were very tasty! We are so full because we kept eating away.  Definitely the best Thai in Scottsdale! I love eggplant dishes and they do a very good job cooking it. Some place tend to over cook it and drench it in oil. Theirs isn't oily at all. I think they use Japanese eggplants too! My fave. Red curry was very good as well. We only did 4 heat because I'm a wimp and it was perfect. For me plenty spicy enough.  I like to keep my tastebuds intact :).   The price is also super reasonable. So here's to picking up food more often! This will be one of my go to places now to grab a quick bite or take out some food :)   It's tucked away next Euro Rhythm Dance and Savers center.  Super cute and clean-very sweet staff-family mom and pop business...mom in the back cooking up a storm!  I that!"}
{"text":"Amazing place! Great food, very natural and authentic. Interior is beautiful, the owner spent 2 months decorating himself! The food presentation was nice as well. I was surprised at how empty it was, we were the only ones eating. Will absolutely come back. Newest favorite Thai spot!"}
{"text":"Thai basil chicken is amazing. Officially a regular for takeout. Fast service. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"We are from out of town and just happened upon this awesome Thai restaurant. Nice people, quiet, fast service. The food is amazing. If we lived here it would be our go to Thai restaurant. We had Tom Ka Kai soup. The broth is terrific and the mushrooms were perfectly cooked. We also had Salmon Pineapple red curry medium spicy. My lips are burning and my stomach is happy. Very tasty. The mixed veggies is garlic sauce, also medium spicy, was yummy. The garlic sauce tastes and smells wonderful, and it is a really good mix of veggies. Can't say enough good things about this place."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to the one in Tempe which was not very good so we were hesitant to try this location out. However, we were surprised by how much nicer this location is and the food quality was much better and much better flavor. We will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"I've tried quite a few of the Thai restaurants in Scottsdale and think this is one of my favorites. After living 15 minutes from LA's Thai Town, I got a very good taste of Thai food. I will keep going back here when I have the craving and have recommended it to a few people."}
{"text":"Yellow curry and pad thai were on point. Spring roll and wonton apps were tasty too. Lady who took my order was a sweetheart. My new takeout thai place for sure."}
{"text":"Clean, friendly, nice little joint. Great menu with lots of choices! Food tasted fresh & the Thai iced tea was delicious. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"La's Thai is hidden away in a strip mall behind the Costco in North Scottsdale. It has a cute interior and the employees working that day were very nice and helpful in answering my veg questions.   For an appetizer, I ordered the Curry Puffs. You get 3 little pastry puffs (aka empanadas) for $8. They were delicious! Golden crispy pastries filled with savory curry flavored potatoes and other veggies. You won't want to share this one!  The Vegetable Fresh Rolls, Fried Tofu, and Edamame are other vegan-friendly appetizers.  I was informed that the egg rolls, although the menu description says \"vegetarian rolls wrapped in tofu skin,\" are indeed brushed with egg as a binding agent, so they are vegetarian but not vegan. DD got the Egg Rolls and she thought they were really good.   For the main course, I tried both the Tofu & Vegetable Red Curry and the Spicy Noodle with Tofu & veggies (omit the egg to make it vegan).   Red Curry was delicious! I ordered it Spicy and it was perfect. The vegetables weren't over cooked so they were still firm and nutrient dense. The tofu was firm as well.   The Spicy Noodles were very good. This dish is served with flat rice noodles and lots of veggies were included. I also ordered this dish at the Spicy level (spice levels are mild, medium, spicy, and Thai Hot) and although it was flavorful, it was not spicy to me. I'll try this dish in Thai Hot next time to see if I like it better.   DD got the Chicken Pad Thai and she thoroughly enjoyed her entree.   Service was excellent. Our waitress was very nice and attentive. My only complaint is that the prices are on the higher side. There's a comparable competitor less than 1/2 mile away whose dishes are $2-$3 cheaper."}
{"text":"Dropped in here for a quick bite to eat. Ordered the fresh rolls (without avocado) and chicken pad Thai. I loved the fresh rolls; they were excellent. I could taste the freshness of the ingredients. I requested my pad Thai to be spicy and it did have a little kick to it but not too much. Granted, I have been eating spicy food ever since I was younger so my palette is pretty desensitized lol. The only thing I wasn't crazy about the pad Thai was that it was too heavy on the fish sauce, the smell of it was overwhelming. I will ask for less fish sauce next time, and also want to try their green papaya salad and spicy basil. Service was excellent too. All in all, it was a great experience."}
{"text":"Wow! This was our first time ordering takeout from here and we were beyond impressed. This place is a small Thai place that makes amazing dishes. We ordered the chicken pad Thai a little spicy and the Tom Kha soup with shrimp. My hubby wasn't feeling good and the soup definitely lifted his spirits. He said it was a very very tasty soup. I can't wait to come back and order the wonton soup (one of my favorite Thai soups) and Kung Pao dish in beef.  Thank you so much La Thai! We are going to be coming back a lot more often now"}
{"text":"Decent Thai food in Scottsdale. Of course, where I'm from, La's wouldn't last. This is Scottsdale and for that, La's was good enough in my books.   After 3-4 days of non-Asian food on Spring Break in Arizona....we were in need of some Thai food bad. We found La's less than 2 miles away from the Scottsdale Stadium area.   The service was good, plenty of parking and credit card ok. Pad Thai...good and decent (a bit on the sweet side), Pad See Ew was good and then basil mint ground chicken (graa-pow) was decent. We were able to quench our Thai food thirst."}
{"text":"I came to La's on a Saturday night with a friend at around 7. It was completely empty, which should have warned me, but we had already driven here and decided to stay. The food was less than amazing. I had the yellow curry, which was very soupy (no thickness to the curry) and my friend had pad see ew, which was dry and not very flavorful. The prices were on par with other Thai places (about 10$ pp). The food wasn't tasty enough to warrant a return trip."}
{"text":"Everything was awesome, fresh rolls were great, papaya salad and peanut curry were great. The family who runs it is great."}
{"text":"Wow!! Where have I been?  La's was a fantastic experience from start to finish.  My partner and I had a hankering for Thai food and decided to head in for dinner. We're overjoyed that we did. From the moment we entered, I could tell that we were in for a treat. The staff was amiable and our waitress provided amazing service with a smile. The atmosphere is casual and the cuisine is top-notch. I ordered an appetizer off the \"special board\" (though it was hard to choose just one, everything looked delicious) and started off with the Tod Mahn (fish cakes with a side of pickled cucumber and sweet & sour sauce) and a round of Thai Iced Teas. For our entrees, I chose the Chicken Red Curry and she picked the Mixed Vegetables with Chicken. Thai food, in general, is so well balanced. This was a step above. Perfectly sour, sweet, creamy, salty with a touch of heat..the portions were large but I didn't leave anything on my plate. It's THAT good. Great service, wonderful food, comfortable atmosphere.  I've found my new favorite spot for Thai food in the valley. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim, the place was not busy but food was very good and service was very attentive and quick. We got the coconut shrimp- good sized and flavorful. I got the green curry which had great flavor and plenty of veggies and protein. Mom got the spicy eggplant and she said the sauce was rich and the eggplant cooked well. I would be happy to come back here!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place. Maybe because im from Los Angeles and we are spoiled with many Thai food restaurants. Overall the food was good and the service was excellent.   I guess this is family owned so the daughter and mom were the ones serving. They were very kind.  I must admit the portions are a little small, but again the food is delicious."}
{"text":"It's not fancy, but I really do enjoy their food. The service isn't always the fastest, but it's a nice place, and I always leave having enjoyed my meal. Whenever I have family visiting, I do take them here, because I know it will be an enjoyable experience!"}
{"text":"OK if there is nothing else.... food is edible but not great... service is horrible, almost always has my order mixed up with someone else's..."}
{"text":"Fantastic curry and thai tea! If thats not enough the staff is friendly too and you need to do a pick up to go order? No problem! You order and get there it is done and done right! I love this place and it is my go-to for Thai food in the Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"Delicious red curry. I loved all of the vegetables in it. The only thing I would change is the bathroom experience... went in and door handle & toilet seat were wet. We were the only customers, so I know it was an employee that left the bathroom that way."}
{"text":"Amazingly poor experience.  No onions in Pad Thai?  Rice and chicken with some seasoning?  Your Thai grandmother would be disappointed.  We used Grubhub and the driver was literally yelling at my wife because he had to wait 5-8 minutes for us to reach him when he was at our door.  I had fallen asleep and didn't hear the phone.    Grubhub is now deleted off my phone, and I still seek a great Thai place in Scottsdale.  Yupha's in Tempe remains the best we have experienced."}
{"text":"I stopped in to La's on a day when I was desparate for Thai after a long road trip. Although I chose to order takeout on this visit, I have to mention the decor inside. It's a roomy--yet cozy--thai house with lots of room for big parties and small tables perfect for a dinner for two. I ordered the Pad See Ew which is one of my two favorite Thai dishes, and my SO ordered the green coconut curry (both with chicken). Everything we ordered were superb! Perfectly spiced, fresh, and a good-sized portion. I will definitely head back here when I have a noodle craving. Plus, they have hours on Sunday which is hard to find for a sit-down Thai restaurant in the area!"}
{"text":"New Thai place in the neighborhood. Much-needed new spot. Kind of bored with the other one or two choices for Thai food. Place is clean attentive staff and food is fresh and tasty. Will definitely be back. Only thing I recommend for them is to get a website with their menu and details. I will post some pictures of their menu for them. I got the number 19 Penang / peanut Curry lunch special. Comes with salad white rice and a mini egg roll."}
{"text":"Cute place with very friendly staff.  My wife and daughter have significant food allergies but they have been very accommodating.  My wife is vegan and cannot have sugar (she gets incredibly \"loopy\" and just doesn't feel good).  Daughter has nut, dairy, and wheat allergies.  Not only did the staff accommodate, but the food actually tasted good even without the sugar that usually accompanies Thai dishes!  Wife had avocado salad with tasty no sugar dressing and eggplant with soft tofu.  I had the grilled beef salad and pad thai which was great. We always go here when we are in the Scottsdale area or not!"}
{"text":"Still giving it four stars and I've eaten here four times since the first time I reviewed this places.  I really like everything I've had, but my favorite is one that my husband got the last time: sweet curry with nuts. He likes nuts, but whatever.  It sounds lame, but it's incredible. Spicy and sweet is such a great combo and I ate more of his, than my own spicy noodles. My dish was good, his was great.   It's cheap for dinner; around $20 for both dishes, and is plenty of food for a second meal, later.   La's: it's what's for dinner."}
{"text":"La's is a very cute place, I stopped in last week and got a pick up order. The pad thia noodles and fresh rolls were so good I'm back again. Very friendly and so far the foods amazing with exquisite presentation."}
{"text":"Pros: Quick Service Pretty good portion size! Affordable I have only gotten takeout from here, but I always get the Red Curry Shrimp.   Cons: The spicy scale is inconsistent.. I was told it was out of 5 levels, so I ordered level 4- spicy but not death. Well nah too hot. So then I ordered a level 3 another time.. this was so weak.. as if there was no spicy taste at all. The next time, I ordered 4 again.. and confirmed it was out of 5 levels.. but then was told nope, only 4 levels.. so I mean, some days it is out of 5 levels, and sometimes out of 4 I guess, sometimes the taste of firey death, other times weak sauce. Another con- the appetizers are legit garbage.. I ordered the wontons.. $9, for burned pieces of pastry with cold, frozen shrimp in the middle.. Took one bite, threw them out. Ordered the fresh spring rolls, they were bland, and tasted just not fresh.. lastly, I have ordered the egg rolls- tasted like a mix of everything in the kitchen, cut up, and rolled and left in oil for too long.   I think the burned pastry taste is old oil.. reused, reheated, etc..   I think overall, if youre dying for a quick fix for some thai food, and on the way home, really hungry off work- yeah order a solid entree and youre golden.  I would not drive out of the way, or write home to mom about the meals tho.. I am moving in a few months, and when I visit Phoenix, not a place I would be dying to get a taste of."}
{"text":"La Thai and Lao Thai are almost similar in name, and they are also very close by in location.  I am not sure if the owners are the same (something I probably will ask next time).  Nevertheless, La Thai is another spectacular authentic Thai cuisine.  I didn't dine here, but the seating space and size of the restaurant is a little smaller.  It is a coincidence that I ordered for take-out.  I ordered the Pad Kra Pow Spicy Basil Chicken and Larb Chicken Salad.  I was very pleased with both dishes.  I ordered medium, and the food was a little mild.   I have to probably say spicy or specify that I am Indian and have a Thai best friend.  Nevertheless, the flavors were tangy and flavorful like many of the Thai restaurants I have been to in LA."}
{"text":"La, la, la, la, laaaas. Hear me sing the praises of La's. I may be biased because it's my 'hood, but since discovering La's, it's my Thai joint of choice for when I'm craving curry, spring rolls, or Thai iced tea. To name just a few of the goodies featured there. La's is reasonably priced, you mos likely won't have to wait a century for a table and the food is generously portioned and actually tastes good. You know, like Thai food should!"}
{"text":"Had the red curry with beef pretty sensational not gonna lie. Asked for it to be level 2 spicy. I figured that would be right in between \"am i sweating?\" and \"I thought i asked for spicy\" and boy did they nail it. Only reason I'm giving it 4 out of 5 is because they do sodas by the can. Now that's not a problem to me but what I didn't like was that all the soda boxes and other cutlery boxes were out on display too but that's just me nitpicking. Overall good food, not bad price, and huge menu"}
{"text":"We absolutely love La's Thai Cuisine. The food is always fresh, hot, and flavorful - filled with choice meat/tofu and veggies. Their curries are dynamite and their rice dishes are so good. We have never been disappointed, and the service is always friendly and quick. Dine in - take out... your choice."}
{"text":"Found this new Thai restaurant on Yelp. Two of us went on a Thursday evening and it was pretty quiet. As others have said the location is a little off the beaten path for evening traffic, but worth looking for. Our server was friendly and knowledgeable and helped guide us in our choices. We started with coconut shrimp, which came with a very nice dipping sauce.  We tried the pad Thai, peanut curry, and pineapple fried rice. All were delicious and we had leftovers to take home. Their food is great, I think their biggest challenge will be the location."}
{"text":"Love this place.  I crave the red curry all the time, though I like a lot of their stir-fry dishes, too.  Everything I've had there is good.  The service is prompt and very friendly and the price is right."}
{"text":"If you're craving REALLY delicious Thai food (both spicy and not spicy), with prompt, friendly service, then get over here! It's tucked into a strip mall but conveniently located. Everything my family and I ordered was fantastic!! Lisa, our server was exceptional!"}

{"text":"Great Thai place that's a bit hidden in a quiet shopping complex. We got the Larb and one of the curries. Both were quite flavorful and spicy. Service and atmosphere were both good."}
{"text":"This is a tiny dine in restaurant.   So I would not go with a large group.     The typical Thai curries are served,  red and green.   They offer nice lunch specials.   The service is nice and timely."}
{"text":"I was a big fan of Char's on University and Rural. After they closed Char's, I had to search for another Thai Restaurant where food is not sweet.After quite a few disappointing trails, I finally decided to trust in random picks. That's when I googled for Thai food and found La Thai. After the first visit, I knew that I am going to be a regular. The first time, the food was tasty but not spicy and I had to spice it up a bit to match my taste. The cook/waiter remembered that and when I went there next time, they made sure that my food is extremely spicy... that's when I realized that my search is finally over. Now I have a thai place where I will be eating at least once every week!"}
{"text":"Came on their opening day, food was delicious. Came out quickly, good prices, perfect for lunch. Best Thai I have had in AZ."}
