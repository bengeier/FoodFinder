{"text":"Just got back from Rose Blanca and I am giving them 3 stars for Effort--not for what I actually received tonight. I am being gentle because I was made aware that there was a new waitress on staff, as well as being short staffed for the night, nothing was expected to be perfect.  The chips and salsa was excellent, I really enjoyed the red salsa, which was just spicy enough. I asked for more!  I ordered 2 Carne Asada tacos and 2 chicken tacos with traditional rice and black beans. My tacos arrived very awkwardly on two separate plates, one for the Carne Asada, one for the chicken. I got the green rice instead of what I ordered, and black beans.   The carne asada was not the best I've ever had, my dad's carne asada is 100% better. The meat was not crisp or flavorful and the cilantro/onion relish lacked enough onion to give it the proper \"bite.\" The green sauce drizzle didn't do anything for me or the tacos. I kept looking around for that red salsa so I could spice things up.  The chicken tacos, on the other hand, were delicious. But, because they were so small and I started on them second and they were spread apart on the plate, not grouped together to stay warm, my chicken tacos were quite cold when I started to eat them. Oh well, they still tasted good. The chicken was very flavorful, savory and moist. I could have done without the onion relish, however, it didn't really have much flavor.  The new waitress had recommended the green rice, and I had ended up ordering the traditional , but by mistake got the green rice. Well...the green rice was bland with an odd smoky flavor I couldn't place. Not really my thing. The black beans were excellent though, and I would order them again.  I think some major tweaking needs to happen with the prices and plating. I went on a $1 Taco Tuesday night. Normally they are $2.95 a taco, and believe me they are TINY. Any other day there's no way I would spend $2.95 per tiny taco. I know they like fancy plating, but they should figure out a way to plate the tacos together when someone orders multiples of each kind (like I did, and my dinner companion did), instead of separating everything out.   I'm really rooting for this place, because the atmosphere is very comfortable and eclectic, with lovely Day of the Dead decorations and soft lighting. I will come back, but will have high expectations!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at countless Mexican cafes around the globe. None have served me a really green, really fresh, really tasty salad. Especially a salad that is a whole meal! The Chicharron de Queso Ensalada Especial fit that bill. Though it has cheese I also considered it a Vegetarian entree....something else I have trouble finding in Mexican eateries. Those of you who are Vegetarian know that standard cheese enchiladas, and quesadillas are just not going to cut it....why would you pay good money for something you could heat up on your stove at home in 2 minutes....right? Also, I normally don't care for the green chile salsas I come across, but the one Rosa Blanca serves with their homemade, extra toasted tortilla strips was heavenly! We asked for more! My husband had the Mole' Pollo Especial, and he said he could actually taste the chocolate! We topped off the meal with a shared Rosa Blanca Peach Flan. Over the course of our near 30-year marriage my husband always says \"don't have the Flan....it's never good.\" Good thing he stuck to his guns, because know we both know what Flan REALLY is. And it is wonderful! RBs is made with real, whole fruit....not some nasty jelly/jam, and topped with a wonderful light sauce, and fresh mint leaves. Bottom line; if you visit the Valley...don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"Sorry folks - went there this weekend (my purchased some livingsocial.com coupons) and the placed was CLOSED.  Like for good.  They really ought to update their webpage, FB, etc.  :(  We made the trip for nothing."}
{"text":"The gorditas here are amazing. The corn masas are delicious, and there is a good amount of heat without being overwhelming.   This place serves truly delicious Mexican food, and the chef is also the owner, which in my mind bodes well for quality control. My only complaint is the chips served with the guacamole were a little too greasy for me. I wish this place was nearer to me, as it far outshines most of the Mexican food places in my area."}
{"text":"Tried Rosa Blanca on a whim because we had a Groupon and the website (and reviews here) made it seem like an interesting choice. I am so glad we went!   The food was so....special. Extraordinary, even! Everything was unexpected and fresh, obviously handmade and perfectly prepared. I am a home cook, and I can appreciate the art of home cooked food, which is rare in a restaurant setting.   We had the pleasure of speaking with the owner/chef and I was delighted to hear some of the nuances of his recipes and his cooking philosophies. You could really tell how much pride he takes in his craft and even if I hadn't had the joy of hearing it firsthand, it certainly shows in the food!  The carnitas were the best I've ever had and the beef soup was AMAZING! Every single item we ordered was prettier, tastier, more interesting than I expected- and I admit that based on what I'd read, I had very high expectations for this restaurant!  This is definitely a new favorite and will replace Cantina Laredo for nights when I am looking for an \"upscale Mexican\" meal. The service was perfect, the atmosphere was vibrant and relaxed and the food was truly beautiful and delicious.   I agree with others that the prices are surprisingly high...but the quality of the food is obvious and as anyone who cooks can tell you, good food isn't usually cheap. You get what you pay for- and this meal was worth the price tag. It will be an indulgence that I look forward to in the future! Thanks for bringing this creative and fantastic cuisine to good 'ol Gilbert!"}
{"text":"On a lazy Tuesday morning my girlfriend and I wandered to this corner of Val Vista and Elliot, intrigued by the statements of \"artisanal, seasonal, authentic Mexico City cuisine\" proclaimed upon Rosa Blanca's website, yet sitting in the middle of bland suburbia.  This was one of the first results that popped up under the new restaurant tab for this area is Rosa Blanca, so I was hoping that breaking away from the usual rotation wouldn't leave me disappointed again (that's NOT what she said, I swear!)  Walking in was extremely startling, with a very trendy decor but very pleasant airy openness.  If I remember right there is probably seating for about 50, with a booth along one wall, tables scattered about, and a bar area, with a view of whats going on in the kitchen as well.  Also of note is the President's Award the owner got as well as picture taken from when he served in Afghanistan.  We were promptly greeted when we entered, seated, and took our drink orders of water for the g/f, and Hibiscus Pomegranate($3)agua fresca for me, which was ridiculously good and was the perfect rejuvenation for a warm day.  We took a long time ordering, with our server checking in at respectful intervals.  The tamale crisps ($8) were calling out to me, with 2 tamales deep fried and cut into halves, topped with Mexican crema and salsa.  1 tamale was pork in a spicy red sauce that I preferred, and the other was a chicken in green sauce which while also quite tasty, didn't quite match the heights of the red.  The interplay between the meat, masa in a deep fried format is something that I intend to indulge in repeatedly- one of the wonders of this dish was the fact that I didn't get an oily feeling at all.  Still feeling peckish and not quite ready to commit to an entree yet, I also ordered a side of Green Poblano Rice ($3), which was described as rice simmered with herbs, poblano chilies, chicken stock, topped with crumbled queso fresco and corn kernels.  The queso fresco didn't add much to this dish I felt, but I still thought this was a wonderful appetizer and a delicious rice dish.  I also ordered Black Bean Soup ($3) black beans served chopped onion, cilantro, and olive oil, which was tasty but nothing spectacular.   Tortas dominate the menu, so we decided to go with them.  My girlfriend ordered the La Ranchera ($9), which was steak, poblano strips, grilled onions, melted Chihuahua cheese, and lettuce smothered in a smoky borracho salsa.  This was absolutely one of the best tortas I've ever had, with the filling being supported by wonderful bread as well.  I'm sure the Taliban put up a pretty tough fight against the owner during his time of service, but I battled an even fiercer opponent in my girlfriend when I tried to get a 2nd taste of her sandwich.  Although I think my forearm will be scarred from when she stabbed me with my fork, I judge that as a fair exchange for a second bite of that torta.    My torta was less of a hit, as I wanted to get away from my comfort zone and ordered La Chilanga ($9), which was barbecued pork strips served with an interesting citrus mayo spread, pineapple cilantro relish and arugula greens.  The pork was tender, but the torta was too sweet for me, but for others with a greater appreciation for sweetness in meat this torta would be wonderful.  I only ate half of my torta, so I also decided to order a beef taco and a carnitas taco ($3 each).  The beef was very average, and the onions + salsa that came with it didn't save it from being too dry as other reviews have stated.  However, the carnitas taco was excellent, with the pork being as moist as pork could be, although once again the onions and salsa were too quiet as accompaniments.    Overall, I was impressed and satisfied with coming here, despite spending about $55 on lunch, although it was $41 pre tip.  If I had ordered a torta more along the lines of what I know I like I probably wouldn'tve ordered those tacos, and the sides I ordered on a whim- so I would say that you would normally be in the moderate price range per Yelp standards, at about 10-15 per person.  For tortas and tacos you don't normally expect that price, but for the quality of this restaurant it is a fair exchange.  I look forward to returning here, hopefully this week!"}
{"text":"One of the biggest dining disappointments I've ever experienced. After hearing a glowing review from another trusted Yelper plus a Groupon, I was psyched to try this place. It's just a few miles from my house, and I love patronizing independent restaurants.  Not considering price, presentation, ambience, or service, the food is bad. My husband got 3 different types of tacos (salpicon, carne asada, carnitas), and he thought the meat was dry and flavorless in all of them. He was also disappointed that they didn't come with any fixings, just a whisper of onions. The beans were ok, but the poblano rice was awful. So bland!    I got a specially made vegetarian torta which was comprised of refried beans, cheese, and sauteed onions/poblanos. The torta bread was good, but it was pretty bland overall. I've had MUCH better tortas elsewhere. Where was the avocado that I specifically requested? Trying to keep food costs down I suppose. They served it with a side of mango salsa which was very good on its own, but it did not go with the dish at all.  The only great dish was the red salsa that came with the chicarron appetizer. It had a great smoky flavor from chipotles. Unfortunately, we weren't offered any salsa with our food (and they certainly don't give you complimentary chips and salsa) so we had a wait awhile for to ask our server for a side. Please note, there were two other occupied tables (a two top and a four top) besides ours.  Once you consider price, the dining experience at Rosa Blanca borders on obscene. Street tacos are $3, the chicarron app is $7.50, and the torta was $8.29.   But the BEST part? They weren't accepting the Groupons because \"Groupon hasn't paid us.\" Unreal!   We will never come back here. Hopefully when Barrio comes to town, we'll finally get some great Mexico City style food in Gilbert.  Updated later this evening (5/17). A message sent by the owner (edgar m.) Kinda funny since I was raised in my dad's Mexican restaurant.--- \"Stephanie, unfortunately you have had a bad experience somewhere else, and wish to bash our fine restaurant to compensate your lack of knowledge of fine Mexico City cuisine. If you want oily orange cheese, dried beans, and old iceberg lettuce go somewhere else as you won't get that here. We strive everyday to bring this community what it so badly is starving for....great tasting entrees at an affordable price. We also noticed that you ordered items that are not on the menu, and our staff did our best to accommodate you....We are a new business and understand we have to be flexible. However, we have to be consistent. Our menu and our products are top drawer. Our preparation is solid. Seems you also had a problem with how to pay. Perhaps you shouldn't eat out if you expect things to be discounted and still can't afford it. ( FYI) cilantro and onions is how street tacos come.... ( \" for all the fixings \") go Filiberto's....\""}
{"text":"Closed.  After I posted this, I received the following message from the owner of this establishment.  I have a daughter with down syndrome, hence the \"retard comment\"  What a great guy, no wonder his business failed.  Seriously lady what is wrong with you. have you nothing to do but to  complain and give a small business a hard time  i get it Your over weight and unhappy. Know this ,when you look in the mirror this type of behavior is why life gave u a retard and your over weight and unhappy. karma karma karma   Signed by the owner. ."}
{"text":"The food was excellent! I had three different street tacos, about $3.00 each, all were delicious. I was hesitant about the pinneaple salsa as most restaurants that have it can serve it too sweet, but the flavors were really well balanced and complimented the meat very well. The sides were all a la carte as the below reviews mention but I didn't find the prices too be too extreme. The owner came over and asked about the food and was very friendly and polite. The place is byob which is even better! I went for lunch so didn't get to drink, but the food is such high quality, I would definitely recommend taking a good bottle of wine to compliment the flavors. Oh and don't forget to order a side of the tomatillo salsa. I nearly licked my ramikan clean after trying it!"}
{"text":"What a daring restruant for the neighborhood, and it's in MY neighborhood, what a lucky gal I am!  Don't come in here expecting Red Burro's and Ground Mystery Meat Tacos or you will be let down, DO come and expect awesome tortas (that's all I've tried so far) and a great fresh selection. I read some reviews about how they charge for the chips and salsa, honestly if I went to most 'mexican' restruants and they offered FRESH chips and salsa for a fee, I would pay for it rather than eat the store bought nasty vehicles for salsa and salt that they offer for free.  My husband and I both commented on how we felt like we were either downtown or in Tempe just from the vibe inside this place, defiantly don't judge a book by its cover. Very nice and helpful staff, I can't wait to go back! (Today actually)"}
{"text":"We tried RBC tonight because we had the Groupon (and had no problem using it) and because we love supporting good independent restaurants.  How refreshing to find something different in Mexican food!  First, no chips and salsa, and that's ok, because I always eat too many and can't enjoy the main course.  The restaurant was fresh, appealing, open.  I didn't see many vegetarian options on the menu (quesadilla and salad are pretty much it) but the waitress offered some off-the-menu possibilities, including chili relleno, which is my standard for judging good Mexican food.    We started with the black bean soup, flavorful and beautifully presented.  Husband's La Tingona Torta held a generous portion of pulled chicken with chorizo and onion; he was fully satisfied.  My chili relleno was a happy surprise -- it was stuffed with potatoes, onions, and a bit of cheese instead of the huge gobs of gooey cheese I usually eat around, and the breading and chunky tomato sauce were quite tasty.  The poblano rice had a slight kick.  The chef obviously has an artistic flair, and he was noticeably interested in our experience.  He was at the table as we ordered, again after the main course was served, and later, to see how we liked the food.  Service was over the top ... sweet waitress.  There are no desserts on the menu.  I wish I'd known to ask for the flan.  We WILL go back ... I'll get it then."}
{"text":"The chips and salsa/guacemole starter is fantastic, esp the red sauce. I could lick it out of the bowl. Tamale app is also very good.  Chef/owner came over to talk to us, totally nice and even sent a couple things from the kitchen we didn't order so we could try (we were the only ones in the place but it was like 4:00pm). VERY good agua fresca, hubby wanted the whole jar.  Flan is ok but strawberries and crema (OH MY GOSHSSHSHSHS) really stole the dessert show.  We will be going back soon and we'll be taking the kids, the friends, the family, anyone who will come. We want this place to do well because the red salsa needs to live on."}
{"text":"A much needed East Valley alternative to the Monterrey Jack soaked Mexican options that dominate the area.  They do an excellent job of making Mexico City street staples such as Tortas, Chicharron,  and Tacos Al Pastor fresh and upscale.  You can eat like a real 'chilango' without having to worry about being kidnapped or being run over by a Bocho cab. I hope that the area appreciates this place and that it continues to thrive and grow. And, yes, they do a Taco Tuesday, so that's your excuse to try this place."}
{"text":"We had a horrible experience. The food was flavorless and over priced. The staff was rude with no personality.   I was unaware the dish I ordered, chili rellano, included nuts. After explaining that I was allergic to nuts, our \"server\" said ok and asked if I wanted it boxed up. Of course, I did not need it boxed up since I could not eat it.   I did not want to wait for another dish since everything was \"made to order\". Especially since my husband received his food first and he was finished eating by the time my food came out.   When our bill came, the chili rellano was still included. We questioned the server. He told me he was sorry I was allergic to nuts. Since we were charged for the entree, I ended up taking a flavorless cheese chili rellano to go. The two bites were a complete waste of calories and it ended up in the garbage.    We were really hoping for a quality restaurant since we live around the block."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!!!!  We tried this place after reading the other yelp reviews, and it absolutely went above and beyond our expectations.  We ordered the chips and guacamole to start, the guac was clearly freshly made, but what really got us was the chips! Strait out of the fryer to our table, and oh so tasty.   I ordered a special they had for the night, short rib served over polentas  with a mango salsa. It was served with a steak knife, which seems to be purely for aesthetics , as the meat was so tender, if I had bumped the table it would have fallen apart! The owner let me know that they slow cook it for 2 days!  The mango salsa was not your typical gooey mango chunks, but shreds not drenched in sauce, which complemented the meat as opposed to drowning it. All this plus fantastic polentas = phenomenal!   My husband had 3 of the tacos. These are small so you can mix and match any of the taco selection to your hearts desire.  When they arrived he feared looking at them that they might be a bit bland, but was pleasantly surprised with a huge pop of flavor! Again super tender meat! These would be a great option for anybody watching there portions, as each taco is small but super satisfying !   The icing on the cake was the service! Very attentive and knowledgeable staff who are happy to describe the selection, as well as recommend their favorites. The owner made a point to introduce himself, check in, and ask for our feedback, which I think is important for a new restaurant.   The only disappoint was that they were out of flan as we arrived quite late in the evening. I guess this means a trip back in the near future... Darn! Ha ha  Truly a pleasant locally owned gem in an area filled to the brim of run of the mill chain restaurants!   Eat here!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, awesome presentation! I liked the fact that they make everything from scratch. The food there was light and healthy, not at all typical restaurants in the area. No greasy food at all. Horchata is to die for! My husband and I will definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Note: I am giving Rosa Blanca 5 stars prospectively in that they have applied for a series 12 liquor license. Currently there is no beer or wine and that is a bit sad in that they have created such sophisticated flavor profiles that they cry out for wine, in particular. The aguas frescas are great, though.  Rosa Blanca blew me away. I had assumed that it would be one of the predictable and safe Sonoran joints that are scattered around the Valley. Not so. Anyone who has ventured past border towns and tourist traps in Mexico knows that there is a whole other world of food that is very complex and exciting. Rosa Blanca is that  kind of food, in the style of Mexico City, to be precise.  The owners have pride in their work and it shows. The meats are all of higher quality than the norm and their plating is beautiful: not what you find in steam table driven mexican restaurants. Everything is cooked to order, even the rice (par-cooked, then finished). The salsas are not the typical, either and are matched to each dish.  Some standouts: the tortas, gorditas, and any of the specials. There are 8 tortas on the menu ranging from the milanesa (which they call La Culeca) through pork carnitas (La Cochinta). The bread can make or break a torta, even if the assembly and the meat quality are perfect. At Rosa Blanca they use the right bread and butter griddle it to give you the crunchy counterpoint to the rest of the bun and the fillings. The gorditas are available with all of the fillings from the tortas.  Specials that we have tried include chicken mole, chicharon de queso salad, and carne en su sugo. The mole was rich and complex and the chicken perfectly cooked. Chicharon de queso salad is a wrap of griddled cheese with watercress, preserved lemons, marinated onions and a citrus vinaigrette: outstanding. Carne en su sugo (meat in its own juices) is grilled diced flank steak in a broth of veal stock, finely diced vegetables and beans. One fishes out the meat and makes tiny soft tacos, followed by devouring the soup. BTW: If you have room for dessert, we loved the flan with poached pear.  We are huge fans of Rosa Blanca. Sadly, we saw folks who were expecting the Sonoran standards come in, read the menu, and leave. It is certainly their loss. Do not let the strip-mall facade fool you: this place is a gem."}
{"text":"We used our Groupon here and were actually really surprised! The strip mall it's located in kinda gave us a different expectation, but this place has the feeling of downtown, trendy new restaurant. We were bummed they don't have their liquor license yet as it's a bit hard to get used to not having your Corona with your Mexican food! I had the Chicharron Salad and while a bit pricey, it's def worth it! This thing is like a work of art and by far the most intersting mixture of flavors I have ever had! Super fun to look at and eat! For dessert I had the Shattered Brownie and again, so much fun to look at! It's a brownie with mint chocolate chip ice cream and crystalized sugar pieces. Hard to explain, but easy to eat! We LOVED the decor and art and will def be going back!"}
{"text":"We live around the corner from this restaurant and when we got a flyer with the menu on the door my husband and I wanted to give it a try.  We both enjoy authentic mexican style cuisine and he was dying to try their Tortas.  So a couple weeks later I see it on Groupon and had to snag it.  All I can say is I'm glad I didn't pay full price for this meal.  It was all around terrible and we found nothing redeeming to bring us back.    We got there about 7 pm on a Friday night.  It was myself, my husband and our 11 year old son.  We were seated by the owner who was a little less than welcoming - not rude just doesn't seem like a \"people person\" - and were seated at a table despite the waitress openly protested to the owner that she \"already had other tables\".  The waitress turned out to be OK.  Polite and offered a quick run down of the daily specials.  I looked around and noted at least two other parties there with Groupons.  The drinks were brought promptly and our orders taken.  There is a very limited menu and none of the usual free salsa and chips with the meals.  I ordered \"La Tingona\", chicken simmered in a chipotle tomato sauce, in a gordita.  But guess what?  They were out of gorditas.  I ended up ordering two tacos -one carne asada and the other the chicken - and I should have worried when, after turning down adding a side of rice and beans (all items are a la carte btw), the waitress asked \"so all you want is just two tacos?\"  My husband had \"La Culeca\" torta and my son the kids cheese quesadilla and beans.  A few minutes after ordering the owner came by and introduced himself then explained that they were busy and apologized for the wait.  An offer f free chips and salsa would have been nice at this point given he knew they were running long ticket times.  Long wait is an understatement.  It took easily upwards of 20-30 minutes to get our food.  You could tell the kitchen (an open show kitchen) was struggling - yelling from the line to the owners and obvious confusion.  The owner was apologizing to one table next to us while the waitress was doing the same at another.    When our food finally arrived I was shocked at the size.  Yeah, I know what street tacos are but for $3 each I guess I expected a little more substance.  They tasted OK but honestly they weren't much better than Baja Fresh.  My husband's Torta was a larger entree size.  Regretfully the chicken was so overcooked it was a shade shy of black and super dry and so overcooked on the edges to be inedible.  In addition, the bread was dry and falling apart making the sandwich impossible to eat in one piece.  The kids meal was OK (how difficult is a cheese quesadilla?) but even that was on the skimpy side.   We didn't even look at the deserts so I can't comment there.  By then we were ready to just be out of there.  All in all a bad experience.  Over priced, slow and poor quality.  Sadly I think they are an example of a place that shouldn't use Groupon - too new and can't handle the volume so many people (like us) will never try it again."}
{"text":"UPDATE 9/20 - CLOSED!!!!!!  Went here for a date night at 5pm on Saturday (left the toddler with a sitter).  We came because we got the Groupon and wanted to support a local business and live nearby.  The place was empty the entire time we were there 5-6:30 Saturday.  My husband mentioned that the bored staff was staring at us a lot (I was sitting with my back to them so I didn't see).  We were told right away that they would not accept the Groupon because Groupon hadn't paid them yet and they couldn't pay their food suppliers and this is a business blah blah blah so unprofessional to tell us their restaurant woes.  Owner told us we could use the Groupon later or get a refund from Groupon.  What an awkward way to start a date night with not honoring a Groupon.  Why pass on your stress and dilemmas to your customers/guests?!!? - it ruins the VIBE and experience of dining there.  We decided to stay (we were on the clock with the sitter and didn't have a plan B).    We got the agua frescas after being offered samples which was nice.  They were good and refreshing but I thought the fruity sweetness clashed with the rest of the meal.  We got the appetizer recommended by our server, chips and 3 salsas, 1 torta and 2 street tacos.  They tortas are big IMP and the street tacos small.  I thought the tortas had too much bread - I ate mine without the top piece of bread so I could actually taste the meat (pork)."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try Rosa Blanca since the first review.  I am always looking for good mexican food.  It has been on my list for some time now.  I had not revisited the yelp reviews for awhile when I found myself in the area and it was lunch time. It was a Wednesday at lunch time and the place was empty.  I thought that was rather odd and sad at the same time since I hate to see any local business struggle.  I ordered the taco plate special.  Two tacos and a drink for $5. The tacos are street tacos.  They were delicious.  I had the carne asada and the chicken.  Both were tender and tasty.  I think the carne asada was my favorite though.  I could have eaten 3 more.  I could imagine being in a tiny town in Mexico and stopping by a street vendor for a snack and having these wonderful morsals.    Since I was the only one there I asked the owner how business was and he said they were having some difficulty.  He also said they do $1 tacos on Tuesday and Thursday.  Now that's a deal!  So, when I got home I thought I would write a review.  I pulled up all the review and started reading the positive and the negative.  I'm sad to say that I didn't like what I was seeing in terms of response to people who did not enjoy their meals or service at the restaurant.  I know that running a restaurant is not easy.  It's hard work and often thankless.  The customer isn't always right but it's not  a good idea to reply back when you don't agree.  Take the criticism gracefully and ask what you can do to make it better. Serving the public is not easy and not everyone will like what you do but if you attack them it can be the kiss of death.  The owner was nice and friendly to me and I enjoyed my meal so I agonized over what to write  My experience was good and I will go back.  Why didn't I give it 5 stars?  I want to try some of the other menu items first. And I would hope that there is a lesson learned here and that is to read reviews and try to adjust without stricking back."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant several times since it has been opened and each time is better than the last!  Every time I come by the restaurant is fuller, so the staff is still adjusting to volume, considering that they have only been open for about 3 months now, but none-the-less they are hustling and working hard to please each customer. The staff is very pleasant and the owner is fantastic! It's nice to know who the mastermind is behind such a great restaurant. He made sure everything was more than exceptional with my meal and loved an honest feedback.   The colorful inside decor is much better than the bland, strip-mall outside and the food blows the expected mexican cuisine out the door!   The presentation of the food is creative, colorful, and worthy of posing for a few snapshots!   The prices can be compared to that of olive garden, but the dishes itself could be a great competitor of elegant dining. You definitely pay for the flavor and not the portion. So if you're expecting some large mediocre burrito that will make you feel overstuffed and sluggish, then this is not your kind of place. I would HIGHLY recommend trying this place out before they realize that they can charge more for their mouth watering dishes!   The braised short ribs is so far my favorite dish here. I could taste the flavors that were emanating from the short ribs before I even put it in my mouth! The dressing of the mango salsa added a slightly sweet and spicy flavor to the ribs, but it was definitely the perfect combination for this dish. Kudos to the mango salsa! This all laid on top a bed of green rice that complemented the flavors of the braised short ribs and mango salsa.   Tacos Tacos Tacos!!! I have had the spicy shredded chicken taco and the pork taco, yet again the flavors that enriched these meats could be tasted before it hit my tongue! When you go, you MUST take a moment to enjoy the flavor combinations of their dishes. I believe their tacos are only $1 on Tuesdays, so if you don't go for anything else, go for Taco Tuesday!!!  And to drink I always enjoy their refreshing Strawberry Pineapple juice and to spice things up a bit a glass of Horchata every once in a while.  All in all a wonderful restaurant that will definitely be battling it out with high end, elegant cuisine in no time!"}
{"text":"It's probably not fair to review a restaurant within a few days of an establishment opening their doors for business, but if the food is this good within just a day or two, I look forward to revisiting when Rosa Blanca has worked out a few of the kinks.  While the decor is sparse, the atmosphere is cheery and bright.  I was a little disappointed that chips and salsa were not complimentary, however when the large plate of freshly made tortilla chips arrived with a delicious guacamole, a spicy red salsa and a totally addictive tomatillo salsa, it was definitely worth the price.  As much as we love Mexican food, my husband and I rarely eat it because we try to eat a low carb diet and most mexican food hardly falls into that category.  That's why I was so excited to see a unique, \"virtually no carb\" offering on the menu.  The \"Chicharron De Quesa\" is Rosa Blanca's take on the cheese crisp, only without the tortilla.  It's cheesy, crispy and totally delicious.  The shredded cheese, which is flown in from Chicago, is crisped on the flat grill and served with a side of fresh guacamole and salsa.  It's offered as an appetizer, but it's plenty big enough for a meal.  I'm hoping they can add a little chicken breast to the dish and also offer it as an entree.  I also tried the Hibiscus Pomegranate beverage which was equally tasty.  They had several flavors from which to choose and other flavors will be available depending on the season.  The owners are trying to use locally available ingredients as much as possible.  I'm looking forward to returning soon to try a few other interesting items like the \"Tamale Crisps\", homemade red pork tamales deep fried and cut into appetizer portions, topped with Mexican crema and salsa."}
{"text":"I bought a Groupon for this place and thought it would be nice to try something new. I'm sure happy I did. The place was nice with fun bright colors on the wall, the staff was friendly and the food was great. They also allow you to BYOB since they don't currently have a license to sell alcohol.  If I had anything bad to say it is that the prices are a little on the high side for the portions but the quality of the product makes it worth splurging every once in a while. I was also a little confused about them being out of the Chicken Enchilada special before 7pm. I guess since they have only been open a couple of months, they still need time to estimate the quantity to prepare for daily specials. All in all, I will definitely be back as soon as I can to try more of their delicious food!"}
{"text":"Finally, an authentic great Mexican style restaurant and it's in my neighborhood!   Don't expect your average greasy burrito or refried beans here - you won't find it.  Rosa Blanca is the newest restaurant in Gilbert - and it's amazing!    We sat at the bar - and the owner explained that his specialty is Mexico City Street style street food.  He buys only local veggies and meats and everything on the menu is prepared from scratch in the restaurant.  We ordered the carne asade tacos, tacos al pastor, chicken green chili tamales, guacamole, fried cheese and a unique fried tamale appetizer.   To drink we had fresh strawberry lemon water and  hibiscus tea.  For desert we split the (French?) creme brule.  Everything tasted fresh, homemade and made to order - even the drinks!  Next time we'll go for one of the dinner specials.    I've had a lot of Mexican food, but after Blanca Rosa Cafe I have new respect for the cuisine."}
{"text":"I'm shocked that there have been favorable reviews on this place. The gentleman who has presented himself as the owner, was nice but not very well put together. Poorly served food, so-so service, dirty tables as well as a bathroom without toilet paper. The girlfriend of the owner was wonderful and did an excellent job explaining the menu. We've been here 2 times - we wanted to like it given that it's in our neighborhood but it's horrible. The food was also very bland & served cold. I'll give them 3 stars for their chips but less than a star on the rest."}
