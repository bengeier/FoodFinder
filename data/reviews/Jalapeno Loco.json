{"text":"The service here is absolutely horrendous!!! We sat for over an hour and waited for everything!! Don't come here unless you want to grow roots in your chair. It would be more convenient to drive to mexico to get food. I hate this place so much that I may avoid the entire street just so I don't have to pass by this place!!!  If I could give this place a thousand negative stars I would!!!!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food.  I am from the southwest and this food is made from scratch.  No cans of sauce or salsa!  Everything is made fresh daily to order.  If you want great food that is not \"gringoised\" try it out.  Most people around here don't know what real Mexican food is supposed to taste like."}
{"text":"Having moved here from San Diego it's been hard to find a place that serves the Mexican food we are used to. These guys went out of their way to make our food was made San Diego style. Miguel was our server and I can't say enough about him. Great place, great people, great food."}
{"text":"Had the lunch burrito (chicken). The chicken was tasty, the rice was properly cooked, the refried beans were nice. The best part of the meal was the chips and salsa, chips freshly made, and salsa had a flavorful mix with a 6 out of 10 spicieness."}
{"text":"We like this restaurant for well-prepared Mexican food and always good service. Prices are very good too. We just came back from AZ, and did not find a Mexican restaurant better than \"Loco\"."}
{"text":"I would not recommed Jalapeno Loco to anyone. The food was horrific and caused  some upset stomachs. My friend had chicken fajita and it was burned with poor seasonings. I had a combination plate with a taco, quesedilla, and burritto. The taco meat was horrible, the quesedilla was made with the lowest quality cheese and the tortilla was not toasted and crispy. It was soft and cold (not too mention it didnt come with sour cream or tomatos) and the sauce on the burrito was very bland. Overal, the food quality was poor. It was a little scary to think that we placed an order for 5 people and approximately 5-8 minutes later our food was ready and served."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I agree with Chris L.'s review.  El Porton is inexpensive but tasty Mexican cuisine and a good option for anyone stuck in Mentor.  We ordered the shrimp/scallops/chicken/beef/chorizo/pork fajita plate for 2 ($28 including soda, tax, and tip) and could not have been happier.  We felt quite full and even had a good amount of leftovers to take home."}
{"text":"Good food, friendly staff and quick service. What else can you ask for?  The Atmosphere is more comfortable and cozier than when it wasn't the previous location."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went there recently, what a waste of time.  We ordered two margaritas and couldn't even finish them.  We didn't even order food due to the place looking dingy.  Would not recommend and we will not be going back."}
{"text":"My wife and I typically come here 3-4 times a month.  Best Mexican food in the area with good service to match.  Food always comes out quick and is piping hot."}
{"text":"I'm sure you have been to a place like this. You order a combinations of burritos, tacos, chalupas, beans, rice, whatever, by telling the server a corresponding number.  It all comes out the same, on a Fiesta ware type platter and it's usually pretty good.  I never really know what I'm ordering because I don't know the difference between a chimichunga and a chalupa, but everything tastes deliciously bad for me, so I don't really mind what I end up with.  As long as there are rice and beans on the plate, too, I'm happy.  The bathroom is INCREDIBLY trippy.  I am too nervous to try their margaritas because I think I wouldn't be able to handle the bathroom after I consumed any amount of tequila."}
{"text":"My husband and I go here at least twice a month. The staff is always friendly and food comes out quickly. We always order the same thing (chicken fajitas) so I'm not sure about any other menu items. They are the best fajitas around and their cheese dip and guacamole is always good! Also their diet coke is up there with Mcdonalds pop! It's always so fizzy! Lol"}
{"text":"It's okay. Not the best out there. Service is ok. Food is ok.  I've had better Mexican food"}
{"text":"Honestly, I am so sad to have to write a bad review. When my friend and I first walked in to try the place, the smell was a little off (didn't really smell like your typical Mexican place). I ignored it and hoped it would be good anyway.  The manager led us to a table, looked tentatively at it, shrugged, and sat us down there anyway. We said thanks and sat down to discover that it was dirty. There were straw wrappers and sugar by the salt/pepper shakers, and there were many obvious stains on the table. We asked the manager to clean off the table and he nodded like he knew it should be done (why he didn't just do it is beyond me).  We waited a while, and then someone came for our drink order. We asked to order, too, since we'd been waiting a while. We both had sangrias and both ordered fajitas. When he brought the drinks to us, her glass had a really think, really obvious lipstick stain on it. I tried the sangria and really thought it was subpar. We looked at each other and called the waiter over and cancelled our food order.  Our waiter got a replacement sangria but didn't take it off the bill. In fact, since we cancelled the food, the price of the sangrias went up from $3.49 to $5.49 each. We had to wait forever to get a check, and the waiter became very passive-aggressive with us. He was like, \"It was just lipstick. I promise that glass is clean.\" But after a dirty table AND a dirty glass AND the lack of trying to make things right, we didn't want to know how the food was.  We left, and the waiter turned his head away from us as we were leaving. I will never go back there."}
{"text":"Pretty good.  Nothing special.  Salsa wasn't hot.  I asked for something hotter and the waitress, (I believe she was a manager or owner,) said \"ok\" but never brought me any back. She actually seemed bothered by having to wait on me.   Back to the food- I ordered a seafood burrito, $13.99.  It was filled with imitation crab meat and I think I saw some tiny shrimp in there, but they might have been Sea Monkeys- too small to tell.  The burrito was covered with cheese sauce- delicious, but not Mexican.  But that's ok- I was in the mood for fake Mexican food. Something with beans, rice and cheese, and with \"Loco\" in the name- like \"Burrito Loco\" and \"Choripollo Loco.\" Or \"Doritos Locos Tacos!\" Yes!   They had Carne Assad on the menu but by the description, it was prepared wrong- using ribeye steak.  Same with the chili verde- the use of strip steak when it should be prepared with pork butt.  The prices were $14 and up for these items.  If they were prepared traditionally, they'd be delicious and a third the cost.  And if they added a Mexican Pizza to the menu, they could pass for Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Margaritas here are good but sometimes uneven on the booze levels. The fresh chips and salsa is very good, the choripollo is VERY good. Been here a bunch and pretty happy with all the meals. The help is not what you would call welcoming, but not rude."}
{"text":"Not much to really say. The wait staff were friendly enough. The food tastes like all Mexican food. Place was clean and prices were moderate."}
{"text":"Always delivers fast, great service. We are probably here once every two weeks. Their frozen margaritas are amazing and food always tastes great along with great prices."}
{"text":"The food was very mediocre and not pleasant. The only good thing about this place is their pitcher of margarita."}
{"text":"\"Jalape√±o Loco is so authentic that they've been raided by INS twice\" is the joke, and I can't say I don't believe it. The food is affordable, the portions huge, and the staff is awesome. Drinks aren't particularly expensive and the bartenders make good micheladas if you ask them nicely.   These guys are within walking distance of my house, and I don't take advantage of that as often as I should."}
{"text":"Food was decent at best ... Service was subpar .... We ended our meal and had to wait 20 minutes for them to clear our plates ... And I had to go and ask them for the check ... I'd rather go to jaliscos"}
{"text":"Great service and great food! It's hard to find Tamales just anywhere! I'm from outta town so I came upon this place from Yelp. Authentic cuisine with a great bar to sit at if you want to be casual."}
{"text":"Our whole family loves this place and the lovely family that owns it! SEEN YOU TOMORROW! Good food"}
{"text":"I've  driven past this place a million times and was in the area and consulted Yelp.  I saw the 4 and 5 Star reviews and thought I would stop. Not sure if it was a bad day but we didn't get the great food and great service that other reviewers did.  We visited at about 7 o'clock on a Saturday night the restaurant was sufficiently full, and we were seated but weren't warmly greeted.  We walked past quite a few empty booths and tables and the server or host took us to the back area that was full of people, it was congested, it was dirty.  He didn't seat us properly and didn't tell us that a wait person would be with us shortly, just kind of dropped the menus and kept it moving. I asked one of the other servers, if we could sit in one of the empty tables in the front part of the restaurant and he said it was okay.  My daughter, grandson and I proceeded to order.  I had the fajita platter, my daughter had a quesadilla and my grandson had the burger and fries.  My daughter and I also ordered margaritas.  The chips and salsa arrived but with no water or anything, the salsa had a bit of a kick so water would have been nice.  The fajitas arrived a short time later with no accompaniments and no entrees for my daughter and grandson.  The fajitas were less than sizzling as described in the menu and the portion was much smaller that I've received at other restaurants, the rest of my meal arrived a few minutes later along with my daughter's entree and my grandson's, at that point the fajitas were sitting and getting colder by the moment we all proceeded to eat our food, our drinks arrived and the underside of my margarita glass still had salsa on it probably from a previous customer. My grandson's hamburger was dark, dry and unappetizing, wrapped in foil like it came from a gas station.  Also had to request ketchup.  The fajitas had no seasoning and the ratio of onions/peppers to meat was way off.  My daughter commented that her food was just ok.  We requested the check and left.  I won't return.  There are too many other good Mexican restaurants within 5 to 10 mile radius"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexico Restaurant.....with awesome salsa and chips. The food is great....you won't find black beans here but you will find very quick service and the price is just right. I had 2 pints of Negra Model with my combo meal of chicken burrito, chicken enchilada, rice, beans and sala.....price includes 20% tip was $20."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food! Chips and salsa are good and the chicken fajita quesadilla is great too! There's never a wait to be seated and the service is fast. Great Mexican restaurant in mentor!"}
{"text":"Food and service are great. Family owned very nice people. Spicy burrito is my favorite. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Ok, this place is a joke, food is stale and flat completely flavorless and tasteless, I would rather spend my money at Macdonald's, this is a total disgrace for Mexican food, pity the people who actually enjoys this, my food was completely covered in onions and 2 shrimps for a seafood dish this is unacceptable, kids menu is only chicken fingers and obviously they come from a box, fries tasted like rancid oil, fajita quesadilla was 2 lbs of green peppers. Horrible horrible experience this place gives Mexicans and Mexican food a bad name, total disgrace."}
{"text":"The typical stick-to-your-bones, comfort food, Mexican joint. Cheesy, spicy, fried goodness that will stay with you like a brick in your tummy all day. Fantastical!   Conveniently located in a shopping plaza in Mentor, this place screams cheesy with lots of bright colors. Not the kind of place you want to come to hungover for fear of decor induced dizziness, but perfect for a festive meal.  The never-ending bowls of fresh tortillas chips and salsa typically fill me up before the food even gets to me, which of course happened to me here. But the chicken and mushroom fajitas were so good that I had to make room. I didn't even need the flour tortillas.   Just keep in mind that you have to bring your check up to pay. My beau unknowingly handed our server the check and he stared at him blankly for about 30 seconds not knowing what to do. Whoops.  Overall, a great greasy meal served super fast for almost nothing. How can you go wrong?"}
{"text":"Oh gosh how I miss this place.   I used to have dinner here every weekend with the fam before I moved. The staff knew all of our drink and food orders by heart and when we left they would jokingly say \"see you tomorrow\" but then part of me would silently think \"Wait, what am I doing tomorrow... can I come back?\"  Cozumel chessesteak is my first pick. It's huge portions. Have it for dinner and then take home half of it home for lunch the next day. Chips and salsa and margaritas both are awesome and arrive quickly at the table.  Friendly service. Definitely recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Very good mexican food without a fuss.  The dishes tend to be heavy and should be considered a dieters nightmare, but with choices like fajitas, one can eat relatively well.  The special fried burrito on the other hand may not be good for the waist, but is quite good to the taste!"}
{"text":"I used to go here at least once a week, and bring people here, get take out but the food started to take a downward trend and there customer service while good is off on the reasoning on some things.  The enchiladas' used to be good but they stopped deep frying the tortilla's  so by the time you finish the first one the tortilla's are mush. I used to spend about 4K a year there,  drink the $8 Chili Margarita's one time I asked for pinto beans instead of black and the bartenders face turned red and he said no,  after I put up fuss they did let me get pinto beans ,  one time there was a Empanada's special with rice and beans and I asked if I could just get the Empanada's (maybe knock off a buck),  they said no,  last straw was about 2 weeks ago,  when we were walking out the door and the waiter came running out say we did not pay which we did,  when they double checked they found that we did pay,  no apology or even a free drink chip,  so they are loosing 4K worth of business over $1 worth of rice and beans (I am going to miss the Chili Margarita's)"}
{"text":"Our server was very friendly we went on a Tuesday I think I'm not sure though it was $3 margaritas.  The margaritas were strong AF especially for just $3.  Didn't get food because I had just ate but overall this place was excellent"}
{"text":"This place use to be called Jalapeno Loco and was at the location where \"Melt Bar and Grill\" is at now.  I was pretty much a fan of the place when it was at the original spot. I mean it's just your typical around the area mexican food, but this place in my opinion always had the edge on others in the area.  The staff here is insanely friendly and the place looks more up to date compared to their last spot.   They've got a nicer bar and it's actually quite spacious inside .    The food here always has more flavor and is never bland.  Their kitchen made hot sauces and salsa are always delish (make sure u ask for it).  The food always comes out on a hot plate and comes out in a pretty fashionable time.  The Margaritas are a little on the light side, but/or maybe i'm just a heavyweight drinker? LOL.    Recommended? YES.  Why? Great food, service, alcohol, Chips starters, and Goooood salsa."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Friendly staff, fresh food, a little taste of Mexico in Ohio! Would definitely come back for more! Ask for their ceviche or shrimp coctel (its a type of soup). 10/10"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, delicious food.  We visited for the first time this weekend and we'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"So after my photoshoot, I decided to take myself out to dinner because I was looking real good in my makeup.  This restaurant is in the same plaza as the studio.  It is a cute litte Mexican restaurant with great d√©cor, a full service bar, and 3 TVs.  The service was very friendly, though it took a while for them to take my order (but that was the only down side to it),  As I mentioned before, I am a \"flex vegan\" so today I was really learning on my flex part.  When they brought out my chips in salsa, I wanted something more with it.  So I noticed they offered a bean dip.  Which in my mind it would only have beans.  Nope!  It was mixed with some yummy cheese!  So I was very satisfied with both the bean dip and the salsa.  The salsa had a nice little kick to it, which I LOVE spicy things!  For my meal, I order the vegetarian fajita platter.  It was so much food that I ate on it for 3 days!  The flavor was amazing and it had carrots in broccoli in the mix, which I appreciated.  I think this was a great decision for me to treat myself here after my photoshoot.  I would say it is a great place to bring kids to or just you and some friends if you are craving mexian and/or a margarita."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT!!!!  Say goodbye to El Rodeo.  We will be coming here from now on for our Mexican fix.  Delish!!!"}
{"text":"En route home from upstate New York, we were looking for dinner and happened to find this place.  It was easy to find, plenty of parking in front.  We walked in, got seated and reviewed the menu.   Waitress asked us what we wanted to drink, water and beer and later the waitress brought us chips and salsa.  Typically, most Mexican restaurants have both mild and hot salsa, but this place only had one kind - mild - but it was great!  I went with Poblano Stuffed pepper with chicken, which came with refried beans and rice and my niece went with beef soft tacos.  I got my beer and I ordered Dos Equis but they brought another kind, but beer was beer and need beer in me.  We enjoyed our chips and salsa while waiting for our food and it didn't take long. maybe five minutes?  The poblano pepper was piping hot, but I wasn't a fan of the chicken.  Nothing wrong with the chicken, but after eating few bites, I regretted going with chicken, should have gone with the beef.... the refried beens were salty, but the rice was great, especially with the salsa mixed in.  The taco meat - beef - was cooked perfectly, bit on the salty side and they stuffed the soft shell taco with ton's of meat... and the only thing you should be putting in the taco the chopped onions and cilantro that comes with the food.  We ended up taking 1/2 of our foods as we ate too much of the chips and salsa.  We ended up taking the leftovers. Personally, I would order the taco instead of Poblano peppers or try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"Jalepeno Loco is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in the area. Even with all of their restaurant relocations, they've maintain the same atmosphere, style and quality for their patrons.  I'll admit, it doesn't take much to please my Mexican food cravings, but believe me, I've been to places that can fail to meet my simple expectations. Luckily, they meet all of my standards for a Mexican restaurant - delicious queso dip, filled-to-the-brim tacos, and free chips and salsa. My friends both got enormous platters of food, both took half home because it was just so much food! And my total bill came out to be just under $10 with tip. You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Pretty good, but standard Mexican. The spicy burrito (which I had with chicken, rice, cheese, and fresh jalapenos) was pretty good. It actually had a pretty good spice. But overall, I'm not sure I'd prefer to go back again but we'll see."}
{"text":"This is our go-to Mexican restaurant on the East-side. My husband and I have been going to Jalapeno Loco for over 15 years... since it opened in the location in Points East Plaza now occupied by Melt. The first time we went, we were college students home on a holiday break. The menu and margaritas reminding us of restaurant near our college that was very popular. We were hooked, and have been going ever since. We continued to dine here when their name changed to \"El Porton\", and we were there to vote to change the name back to Jalapeno Loco. I had a margarita at their old location after \"saying yes to the dress\" wedding dress shopping, celebrated multiple birthdays over the years at this restaurant, and have made countless other memories. Needless to say, I'm extremely attached to this restaurant.   Their food never disappoints. This is a trustworthy restaurant that serves reliable, consistent food. They sometimes seem understaffed, but the service is none-the-less incredibly friendly. The salsa is of the thinner variety, but always delicious. The chips and salsa are never ending. For meals, my husband is a big fan of their Grande Burrito and the Burrito Loco. I usually get the Chimichanga (on the Especiales menu), but this varies. I've honestly never been served something I didn't like. Mom is a fan of the fajitas. Dad orders, \"whatever he's having\", and points to my husband - it's become quite the family joke. The portions are large, and we always have enough to take home for a lunch at work the next day. The margaritas are reliable and consistent, and are only $2.99 for 12 oz. on Mondays.  You can always find a coupon in a local flyer.   The restaurant is usually pretty quiet, even when it is crowded, which makes it easy to converse with your date, friends, or family.   This review maybe a little biased because I am extremely sentimentally attached to this restaurant, but it is one of my favorites on the East side.   Jalapeno Loco - THANK YOU!"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout and the meal was excellent. Easy to communicate and was on time as expected. I'm looking forward to you making a visit for the full dinner experience. Excellent food and service so far :)"}
{"text":"I just got done working out in then neighborhood and was hungry for some lunch. Came in during lunch hour. They have an cheap lunch menu items you can order from. I got the chicken taco salad. They don't skimp on the chicken that's for sure! I thought for the price I paid it was a good amount of food. It was delicious and tasty. They also serve free chips and salsa when you dine in. Their salsa is really good, to me had a small kick to it which was nice. I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great Chips & Salsa!! Great Steak Fajitas!! Great place for lunch! Great service from a nice Mexican lady! I want more Mexican food!!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Best cheese dip.  All the servers are so friendly.   Large margaritas.  Some of the best Mexican I've had.   Crazy affordable.   I don't go anywhere else for Mexican."}
{"text":"I have never once had a bad experience here. This is my favorite place for Mexican food in this area. I always regret trying new places because nothing is as good as Jalapeno Loco! The prices are good, the food is always hot, and the sauces are great."}
{"text":"Great food. Miguel was our waiter and he was very attentive, courteous, and handsome!"}
{"text":"GREAT meal!! Osvaldo was our server & he was fabulous! So much bang 4 the buck! Always great food & service!  That other reviewer was being LAZY! Some jerk that thinks yelp is gonna make her a professional restaurant critic! Lol. I was there on mothers day as well, and it was packed & there were plenty of employees! Also, like MOST mexican restaurants...you pay at the cash register...not at your table.....THAT is why it took ages for her to pay...being lazy & probably rude! She says food & drinks were good...but complained about service, when it was HER that was too lazy to go pay her own check!!  Smh! I think loyal customers KNOW that ladies review is garbage!   Always great food, personable employees & clean!  Muchas gracias Osvaldo y Jalape√±o Loco!"}
{"text":"I have been to JL dozens of times. It's our friendly neighborhood Mexican restaurant. The tortilla chips they serve are always fresh, the salsa is unique and the majority of the staff is either the owner, his wife and their kids. All good friendly people.   The food is good and I always enjoy it but it really depends on what day you show up. For me, the problem is consistency. On the good days the food is fresh and well seasoned and on the bad days it's as bland as hospital food and that makes me sad.   They have a card program that is useful, seven visits and you get a $6 off your next meal. Not bad. And they have my favorite drink pineapple Fanta! Good place."}
{"text":"I went back last Friday and as bad as it was on my last visit, it was great this time. It appeared that they have added to their staff. Usually at most there is 2 or 3 hosts. This night there was at least six. The food was excellent too. We were seated and for a table of four we were given two bowls of corn chips and salsa instead of the customary 1 bowl for four guests. The salsa was also very much improved from my last visit. With nice size chunks of tomato and fresh cilantro...it was great. I am so glad. For at least 5 years this has been my Mexican restaurant of choice, driving over 20 miles to eat there.  Pleases folks keep up with the latest improvements. I'd hate to have to lose you."}
