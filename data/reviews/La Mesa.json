{"text":"My family and I love this place. Friendly staff. Great service every time. Quick service, great meal. Gotta love the cheese dip! Yum yum"}
{"text":"Really the best mexican food around!  We've been back many times and always have a delicious meal.  My favorite is the molcajete - its absolutely delicious!  I highly recommend this little gem."}
{"text":"Hummm!! You may want to pass this one by - unless of course - you want to go fast track with CABG! Food greasy. No atmosphere whatsoever. Tried it once and hubby got sick. Thought we'd give it another chance. It's now on our \"do not repeat\"list."}
{"text":"Our wait to be seated was the ONLY good thing about our visit on May 5.  The utter chaos of all staff was immediately apparent.  The waitress took over 10 minutes to greet us at our table and to get our drink orders.  Everything was SSSSSSLLLLLOOOOOOWWWWW.   Our order was incorrect.   The food was cold.   The rice was over cooked and lacking flavor.   We had to add salt to our salsa.   Will NEVER go back."}
{"text":"GREAT service from a lovely family. Delicious, authentic Mexican dishes - the carnitas and baked pineapple are my and my husband's favorites. The restaurant is clean and well-maintained. We have made this a regular spot."}
{"text":"not impressed. chips weren't fresh. salsa was just okay. meals were ehh. I'd rather drive the 10 miles to go to El Palenque any time."}
{"text":"La Mesa is your quintessential no-frills, neighborhood Mexican restaurant that makes up for a lack of decor with really good food, friendly service, and margaritas that will knock you flat on your ass. Carlos, the owner, always goes out of his way to please the customers and is willing to make anything the way you like it. The menu is extensive, but not ground breaking, and the sides are your standard rice, beans and guacamole. The entrees stand out though, and I recommend the mochahete or just some chicken tacos. Yeah, this place ain't gonna end up getting a Micheline star anytime soon, but the food is good, the prices are right, and getting a margarita the size of a small child to wash it all down with doesn't hurt either."}
{"text":"nice little place to eat during the week. cheep good food great marguerites!!!! don't forget the cheese sauce!!! it is a must have when going here. if you like Mexican this is as good as any other in mentor and half the price"}
{"text":"I must say that the other reviews were a bit harsh as Carlos the owner really takes great pride in his restaurant and the quality of food is as good as it gets for mexican.  My wife and I have been to many Mexican restaurants and this one is one of the best.   No it isn't your typical large scale restaurant but a very down home feeling with excellent food.  Tonight we had bean dip made with cheese and My wife had tacos which blow away taco bell for only 99 cents each, but far better.  Wow, not to mention the excellent margaritas!  Carlos and LaMesa is now our go to Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"La Mesa is the best spot around for Mexican food in this area. Hands down.  Not only is the food fantastic  (the carnitas rock), but the atmosphere is always friendly and the margaritas  are always cold. Carlos is a warm and friendly host. Going to his restaurant is like going to a friend's house for dinner. I will always recommend his restaurant to anyone who wants a homemade Mexican feel and meal."}
{"text":"Two words, bad shrimp.  I ordered a seafood burrito and the shrimp was bad.  I don't go back to places that serve bad seafood, just a rule of thumb."}
{"text":"I will make this short because i do not want to be reminded how dirty and horrible this place was. The food tasted like dog crap. I am more mad at myself for paying for the little bits we ate. Please do not go there"}
{"text":"Stumbled on this place just driving by so we stopped in, although we where the only people in here (3:30pm on black friday) we still felt giving it   A try was worth it. Let me tell you it is clean and friendly the food was quick very hot temp wise and for the price extremely well portioned. I truly recommend popping in this place even if its a little off your path, tasty fresh and by far better then anything along mentor ave."}
{"text":"The moment the cultural dish of your choice touches your tongue, an explosion of amazing flavor is set off. This restaurant gifts your mouth an unforgettable experience from start to finish. Never again will your body accept at other Mexican food, besides the quintessential dishes that are on La Mesa's menu. The food is modestly priced, completing this symbiotic relationship between the vendor and the customer. Buen trabajo, la Mesa. Buen trabajo."}
{"text":"My family and I get take-out from here occasionally.  Good tasting Mexican food, though very similar to other Mexican restaurants in the area.  Prompt and friendly service.  Nothing to write home about, but certainly solid.  Low prices make it an appealing place."}
{"text":"Wonderful little restaurant people are extremely nice.  The food is incredible you will not find better!  Carlos the owner is wonderful and treats you like family!  Go here love the food then tell your friends!!"}
{"text":"My family has a tradition of going out for Mexican food once a week minimum. It's fun to try new places when they open in the area.  The owner of La Mesa comes from Jalapeno Loco in Mentor (another spot we frequent). The food and menu is similar. Mine was good, but not outstanding.   They were having problems making frozen margaritas when I was there. Our waiter crushed up ice to make mine instead so I didn't have to wait any longer so that was a bummer.  It's not our most favorite, but we'll be back. Good option if you're local."}
{"text":"Visiting here from Southern California, this was a GREAT Mexican restaurant. Appears to be family owned place and prices were very reasonable. Salsa was fresh and very good. Guacamole was a little salty. Service here is very friendly. This place is better than most Mexican places in Southern California. Definitely will come back if I am in the area again!"}
{"text":"Hours posted didn't match what we saw. We showed up hungry during what the door even said was open time. Yet no one was there? Seems strange. Is this place still in business?"}
{"text":"I love everything about this little local Mexican establishment. Prices are great. Food is fantastic and very authentic. Great flavor and spices on all their meat dishes"}
{"text":"Very friendly and welcoming service. The food is delicious and comes very fast. Also i think they have the freshest chips around. Very clean as well."}
