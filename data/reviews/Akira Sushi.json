{"text":"Went here for sushi because all the other places were packed, at prime time this place was empty ( we came at 7pm), we were the first patron.  We ordered a few dishes, sushi, and teriyaki dishes, sushi was alright, could've been better, but the teriyakis were really tasty. I recommend the ribs, salmon, and eel sushi.   Food came out quickly, and they do have a very big variety of items. Big plus!  The service, however, is spawn from hell. This place has the worst waitresses I've ever seen. Slamming dishes and cups, pop served without glass, dirty looks, unfriendly and unwelcoming environment. The other waitress also lectured my girl about not eating all her rice, and \"It's dinner time, we have sashimi, if you order rice you have to eat all your rice\"- our less rude waitress.   I was going to give them a better rate but the service killed it. Service makes up for food, in this case, I'd rather go get my own food and serve myself."}
{"text":"Worst sushi ever!  Rice made up 90% of the sushi.  This place is a rip off.  On top of that, the service was slow and the people that work there seem to have an attitude problem.  Would not go back nor recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"This AYCE sushi place has taken over what used to be the Yaki Kushi Bar, which was a fairly good place.  Akira, however, is a real let down.  We had two maki rolls which were ok, but nothing special. Their cooked dishes were all disappointing. The hargow wraps were thick and stodgy and the miniscule shrimp fillings were all dried out.  Karaage chicken consisted of small, tough, overcooked pieces. And the vegetable tempura included large pieces of inedible taro slices.  Not sure why such a mediocre Japanese restaurant has once again opened up on this strip of Bloor St."}
{"text":"Sitting here and eating... It is so bad and we are forced to eat sushi that's filled with a shit load of rice .......   Horrible service as well, no wonder no one wants to eat here."}
{"text":"DECENT SUSHI, BAD SERVICE  This AYCE's sushi here is good, but anything else besides the sushi & green tea ice cream is well below average.   The first time I went, I mostly only ordered sushi, which was great. The second time, my friends ordered other things like chicken teriyaki, sausage, dimsum (har gow & siu mai), beef teriyaki, beef kabob, shrimp kabob, and various other things were either cold, bland, frozen microwave food, or just badly cooked. The exceptions were their icecream, most of the sushi, fried milk, and fried rice (which my friend loved).    The service was just terrible. The waitress had kissed her teeth, and was impatient. I thought she was having a bad day the first time I went, but the second time was just worse. Another waitress came along, who was much friendlier and informative.   Overall, 3 stars for good sushi, especially their dynamite, black roll, red roll, eel sushi, fried rices and green tea icecream. I don't eat live salmon on my sushi, but my friend who did, did not enjoy it. So stay away from the salmon rolls as well! If you're going to come here, come here solely for the AYCE sushi at cheap rate of $20 for dinner and expect nothing else."}
{"text":"I'd come here (AYCE) for the sushi pizza, as well as a few of the rolls and ice cream.  Decent for the price. We didn't get a few of the rolls in our order, but we were stuffed anyway so it worked out okay.   The good: Green salad, mango salad.  Agedashi tofu. B.C. Roll Red Dragon Black Dragon Sushi pizza Bloor St Roll Eel avocado roll White Tuna roll  The bad: Chicken wings Sweet & Sour Chicken  The so-so: Squid tempura (mostly breading)  Beef teriyaki  Nigiri sushi (salmon, white tuna, snapper, mackerel). Mountainous rice piles."}
{"text":"Was taken in by the 20% discount, and all I have to say is, I would not go there again even if it was 50% off.  The staff looked miserable and unfriendly. We had to ask twice for our water.  The food was below standards of sushi, very unfresh (especially the avocado + salmon roll).  The seats were extremely uncomfotable- wooden tables and stools."}
{"text":"I'm not sure about the previous reviews on Akira Sushi, but the Akira Sushi we went to yesterday was Amazing!  Walking in the restaurant, we were surprised by the cool decor. I really love the wall they had, and the wooden seats/benches and tables really added on to it. I did read the previous reviews stating that the seats are uncomfortable, I guess if you are wearing something that would slide you off the seats, that would be the case.  The server greeted us and everyone else that walked in after us nicely and with a very nice warm smile. I get the whole language thing, but it was really not hard to understand like stated in the other reviews. She explained the difference between the regular menu, lunch AYCE menu and dinner AYCE menu, so this time we tried the lunch AYCE menu.  I have to say that the food here had blown us away, not expecting the food to taste that good because of the price.  Having tried many of the sushi places on Bloor Street, I have to say this is now one of my favorite spots.  My friends and I are definitely coming back to try the dinner AYCE menu. I added the sushi rolls we had as well as the wall that I really really loved.  Would definitely recommend to others! Thankfully we tried the place prior to seeing all the previous negative reviews.... I would have kicked if I didn't check the place out because of the negative reviews."}
{"text":"this place closed down recently, but it had really good beef fried rice and tempura. If it ever opens up again try them!"}
{"text":"I was on Bloor St. with a friend looking for a filling place to eat, and saw that Akira was having a grand opening 20% off on AYCE, so we decided to give it a try.  The selection was pretty decent in my opinion, and we were told there were no limits on the pieces of sashimi we could order (due to our server's broken English we could have interpreted this wrong). We didn't test this out as I personally don't enjoy sashimi much and my friend couldn't eat a lot by himself.  The food was of average quality; nothing too special, but at the same time I wouldn't complain for an AYCE meal that ended up being just over $20 incl tax. As I mentioned, the selection was quite varied and some of the fried dishes were quite tasty.  Our service was quite disappointing, however, as we had to ask the server many times for food that didn't come, and in the end there were a few dishes that never made it to the table. Although she wasn't rude, she also wasn't the most attentive.  The seats are also very uncomfortable as they are little wooden stools with no where to put your bag/coat.  For the price, I would consider coming here again, provided they hire some more servers who can speak/understand English better (this is not a jab at people who can't speak English - there was legitimately a problem in communication while we inquired about the menu/ordered our food)."}
