{"text":"Went with two other people, ordered the General Tso's chicken and the Spicy Braised Fish with the intent of getting a third dish if we were still hungry.    The fish came with an option to substitute fried rice for white rice for $1.50, and I requested that.  The fried rice came out way too fast for it to have been fried to order.  It tasted like steamed rice seasoned with soy sauce, and there were maybe 5 carrots/peas in the entire bowl.  It was too salty for me to enjoy, but I kept it on my plate hoping that the sauces from the main dishes would cut some of the salt.     Spicy fish and chicken came out, neither had even the faintest spice but both were horribly salty.  In addition they were overcooked to the point that I couldn't tell which meat was which, and had to rely on the garnish to tell the two dishes apart.  The chicken was the worse of the two, because in addition to being salty and overcooked it was cloyingly sweet and buried under a thick (ketchup-consistency) sauce that was impossible to eat around.  I told the waiter that we wanted to exchange the chicken for a different dish.  He said that this was impossible, and that this is how General Tso's chicken is supposed to taste.  I started to argue, but decided it wasn't worth it since even if we got a replacement, we'd likely be trading one inedible dish for another.  We picked at the fish some more, and left hungry.  When we got the bill, it turned out that we were charged three times for fried rice, even though we only requested it with one dish."}
{"text":"Order the hot and sour soup to start, to share or as your entree. Just be sure to order it. It's my favorite H&S. The service is always great."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout from this restaurant today: Orange Chicken and Crab puffs..The food was good....Portions huge.....The pieces of chicken were cooked nicely. They could have been a little crispier. The orange sauce was good and plentiful.  The crab puffs were cooked perfect, and the filling was great..  My only not so great comment is that the inside of the restaurant smelled like old moldy feet...I don't think I would like to dine in."}
{"text":"Don't get take out during dinner. $10 for medium sized sweet and sour dish. It doesn't even come with an eggroll.  Their lunch dishes are cheaper and have more food! What a ripp off."}
{"text":"Ordered take out tonight 7/22/15. Garlic shrimp is heavily breaded and soggy. The shrimp are very small and have the tail on them still. Lemon chicken was awful. It was breaded, dry and tough. The lemon sauce came in a separate container and is really awful. Tastes like the smell of lemon pledge. Thankfully the spicy fried rice and vegetable fried rice were good or we would have had to order a whole other dinner from somewhere else. I probably won't return. If I could rate 0 or negative stars, I would, but 1 was the lowest available."}
{"text":"Great experience. Nice staff.. very QUICK and DELICIOUS. A little pricey but portions are HUGE!"}
{"text":"This place is the best Chinese food around by far. The staff is so friendly especially David, he is a server. I'm a college student on a budget and the prices are great for the amount of food you get! Yes the furniture is a little out dated and at first I was so skeptical but it is VERY clean :)"}
{"text":"My family and I love this restaurant. We've been coming close to 20 years. Our ten year old grand daughter has been coming with us since she was 6 weeks old.  Her favorites are crab puffs and mu shu pork.  My favorite is General Tso's chicken, but I will eat anything they make as long as it doesn't have green bell peppers in it.  My stomach cannot tolerate them, but there are so many great choices, it has never been a problem."}
{"text":"Yummy Chinese food. We have enjoyed this local place for takeout several times on 2016. Everyone is personable and service is quick. It's your local old fashioned Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food, service, and value. I have been eating here for over 10 years and it is still as good as ever."}
{"text":"Not good orange chicken breading was mushy, and the chicken was dry and tough. Could not finish. Brown rice had one pea in it and no carrots as described by the waiter. Save your monies"}
{"text":"My family dines here at least once a month. It is slightly expensive for Asian food, but we still feel it's worth it. We actually CRAVE their sizzling rice soup - when my daughter isn't feeling well, and wants something yummy with lots of flavor (- in a mild way, hard to explain the savory goodness!) she always asks for sizzling rice soup!    I am surprised by some of the negative reviews- but I've not ordered those dishes... Our standby dishes which are great every time: moo goo, garlic chicken, chicken mushroom. Tempura shrimp, egg rolls.   I recommend this place for sure!"}
{"text":"The worst Chinese food I ever had. I am born and raise in China, this restaurant have nothing connect with Chinese. The food are bad, taste bad. the waiter's attitude are bad, he just showing a Chinese what Chinese food is and what he showed is totally wrong."}
{"text":"We love this restaurant, our favorite, there food is superb.... My husband and I love their mushroom appetizer in garlic butter....  he also loves the chicken enchiladas in their delicious red sauce.... I love their Shrimp with those same mushrooms,what ever you choose you will be delighted.... The service is excellent, they are so friendly.... It gets pretty busy when there is no road construction for the light rail....  Our friends and Dave and I can't wait for it to reopen.... That road construction is taking forever....  I would love to get on their mailing list and find out the minute they reopen.... waiting impatiently...."}
{"text":"I went to Yen Ching's for the first time last night with my mother. I was probably several decades younger than the majority of the clientele as well as the decor but don't let that fool you. This was probably some of the best Chinese food I have had in quite a while. I'll be taking my husband (he's very picky about Chinese food) here soon so he can try it out too! Thanks for a great meal (and tons of leftovers), Yen Ching!"}
{"text":"Great food very nice atmosphere. Love the fish we have been going here for over 15 years. Friendly service   We go at least twice a month"}
{"text":"I had the Kung Pao2 (Kung Pao with shrimp and chicken).  It was very good.  It came with white rice ($2 more for fried rice seemed too much).  The rice was cooked well, not too mushy or too crunchy.  The amount of food seemed a bit small, maybe enough for one person, but definitely not for two.  The price seemed a little high.  All in all, it was good food and service and I'd go back again."}
{"text":"I have been going exclusively to Yen Ching for the last 5 years and only once before did i have any mistakes on an order, until now. I placed an order for myself, my wife and for my mother in law. I asked for a dinner sized chicken and broc in WHITE SAUCE. When i got home the chicken in broc was in the brown sauce, since Yen Ching closes between 2:30 and 4:30 i had to wait 2 hours to call in the mistake. When i managed to get ahold of someone i was informed the woman that took the order was not there anymore that day and had to call e back. When i did get to speak with her she argued that i never once said white sauce, it was my fault an they would do nothing bout it. Our room mate is still bitching at me for the order mistake and for a simple $10 dinner i can not recommend anyone go to here since if your order is messed up they will do nothing for you. Sad, i have spent thousands of dollers here inthe last 5 years and now, i will never buy from Yen Ching again."}
{"text":"This review is in regards to the quality of the food only. The service was amazing and the staff was extremely attentive despite being so short handed today.   I order the shrimp chow mein, beef with broccoli, and Mongolian beef. I really, REALLY wanted to love this place because I've had the hardest time finding decent Chinese food in Arizona.   Basically, the food was super bland with very little flavor and the portions were super small for what I paid for. It was around $29 for all three entrees and they didn't even come with soup. The portion size is still bothering me. It was literally maybe one big scoop or entree drowning in sauce. But it's mostly the terrible taste of the food. I couldn't even swallow the Mongolian beef. Unfortunately, I definitely won't be returning."}
{"text":"Terrible, I felt like.... \"Hurry up and buy!\" This ex-strip club now Chinese food is terrible. Don't ever...ever.... everevreverevrever. Ever.  Come here!! All bad, sweating, please turn up a.c. Left half my food.. Kept repeating myself....smells like doo-do."}
{"text":"We've been going here for years. Great food and incredible hot and sour soup. Have never actually sat down. We always get take out. Always recommend!"}
{"text":"Found this little gem on a recent family trip. Great service and the food was amazing! Our order came out super fast. Great place for sit down or take out. Highly recommend this restaurant. The only negative aspect of our visit was that we had to wait a bit for our check but they were very busy and we weren't in a hurry so even that wasn't such a bad thing."}
{"text":"The staff is super friendly and you get good service for in restaurant and for take out.  I think they have a harder time with large parties, as that was my only mediocre experience with this restaurant.  All other times were good.  Favorites:  Hot and sour soup Minced beef with cilantro soup Moo-shu chicken"}
{"text":"Well let me start that this place has been around for forever, so they must be doing something right. I remember going here with my family after all my silly plays in elementary school and I still go here, I'm now in college. The food is really yummy  and the price is inexpensive. The restaurant decor is a little funky but I don't go there for that. The people who work there are super nice and will take very good care of you. They have weird hours on Saturday though, which is my only complaint. They open around 4:30 pm but the food is so worth it."}
{"text":"On the menu for us was General Tao's chicken Chicken Lo Mein Kung PaoToo ( chicken and shrimp) Fried rice Crab puffs Everything came out fresh and hot and very delishish!! The service was fast and very attentive ! Portions are huge! The cost for dinner was $40.00 bucks not bad for great food and great service!!"}
{"text":"Two of us arrived at about 1 pm. The parking lot was full. Walked inside to nobody at the desk. There wasn't a sign staying \"seat yourself\", so we waited. There were two servers helping people, and they both made eye contact with us, yet nobody acknowledged us. We waited about 5 minutes, then left. Had someone just acknowledged us, that would have been fine, we would have waited.  On a side note, the metal stapler at the front desk is beige, and it is filthy. If they can't clean often-used items, I have to wonder about the cleanliness of the rest of the place"}
{"text":"The service is always great here. I love the sizzling rice soup, and chicken. The whole atmosphere is so relaxing."}
{"text":"Nasty. Better off going to Panda Express. It's just sloppy, greasy, and bland. Not to mention that they forgot an entire entree for our take-out order, which we didn't find out until we got home. The old folks around superstion springs probably love it - cheap and bland."}
{"text":"My entire family loves this place. The decor is outdated, but the food and the staff are awesome. My Husband introduced this place to me 10 years ago, and it is by far our favorite chinese place to go to. I prefer to there rather then take it home. Even though the decor is not awesome, I like the atmosphere and the staff."}
{"text":"Ive been coming here for almost 20 years, and the quality of food, staff, and decor have not changed one bit.  Please, please, PLEASE check their hours before stopping. They tend to change. Now, when you get here, DO NOT be put off but the pink and blue 80's decor. The food is worth it. So, so worth it.  Everytime we come here, we get the same older gentleman (who really is the *sweetest* guy) serving us. He's always prompt, attentive, and more than cordial.  We always get a Bo Bo platter (also called a Pu Pu platter), tea, and 2 side dishes. The platter (for 2) comes w/ an egg roll, deep fried shrimp, crab puffs, foil wrapped chicken (one of my faves), spare ribs, and beef on a skewer (complete w/ a flaming platter to crisp it up). This place is one of the only places in AZ Ive found that serves this platter w/ flames.  The tea is always delicious and hot. We opt for chicken fiend rice (some of the best in the valley) and chicken chow mein (crispy noodles), along w/ an extra order of crab puffs. Its enough food for take away and it's as delicious the next day.  Be sure to as for some real hot mustard to go and enjoy some of the best Chinese food in the valley!"}
{"text":"This place is always good - we've been coming here for many years and they have always been consistently good.  David the waiter is always friendly.  The decor is a little tired, but don't let it fool you - the food is always delicious!"}
{"text":"I love this place and have been a loyal customer for over 10 years. I always joke to my friends of if I have one last meal , it would be here. I could eat here every single day and not ever get tired of it. My favorite is the sweet and sour chicken. I love the staff, they get my order right every single time and remember it before I even tell them. I love love love it!"}
{"text":"Good service, egg drop soup was salty but wasn't bad and you get a chicken wing dipped in brown sauce with a cream cheese dumpling. The lunch menu is pretty large and has an entree with a side of plain fried rice. I asked that the vegetables be well done and they weren't. The sauce on both our entrees was so strong it was almost uneatable. I had to mix it with the rice and a couple spoons of sweet & sour. Neither of us was able to finish our entrees. Best I can say is Been There, Done That"}
{"text":"This place has been around forever. I remember it 25 yrs ago and it hasn't changed.  Nice, with a touch of old fashion elegance. Table cloth and soothing soft music in the background.  Kick ass cocktails. Good service. Guys in bow ties. The food is better than most places out this way. We will be back."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Chinese food in Mesa. The day service is impeccable and very friendly. The food was absolutely delicious and authentic. The potstickers are a must especially when they put the sauce on for you and the vinegar really brings out the flavors!   We ordered: Potstickers appetizer  Cashew Chicken platter Orange chicken platter Lo Mein White rice"}
{"text":"Outstanding service and food. The owners ( Ruby and Tom) are the sweetest people and take great care of their customers. Sizzling rice do up was delicious, as was the chicken with vegetables and Kung pao chicken.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Terrific food!  Great drinks.  Usually very busy but will worth the wait!  Nice place white table cloths even!"}
{"text":"In Mesa, we enjoyed Yen Ching for dinner.  Very clean restaurant to enjoy liunch or dinner er.  I had Mongolia Beef the position was very plentiful.  was so delicious I enjoyed 2 plate full.  Service was very good, ample time to look over the menu & to enjoy watching the fish in their fish tank."}
{"text":"Went with 7 other couples.  I have traveled around this country and consumed many cuisines.  I have to say this was the worst Chinese food I have ever experienced.  The Orange Chicken was awful,  egg rolls-terrible, service was bad.  There were leftovers and I did not bring them home.  Wait staff was horrible!  Did not deliver what I ordered and tried to convince me to take what they brought which I refused.  Had to beg 3 times for a refill of my ice tea.  Old, not clean front door was dirty...a hint of what was to come."}
{"text":"We're searching for a \"really good\" Chinese restaurant in Mesa, and decided to give Yen Ching a try after reading the usual mix of reviews here on Yelp.  I'm in the \"meh...I've had better\" crowd...  I ordered the sesame chicken combo dinner, which came with egg drop soup and chow mien.  Soup was excellent (and temperature HOT), but the sesame chicken was tough, and if not for the sauce, would have been flavorless.  The chow mien was equally bland.  My brother-in-law ordered Korean ribs for an appetizer and shrimp in lobster sauce for his dinner.  He liked the shrimp dish, but we both agreed the ribs were tough, and again, not a lot of flavor.  The good?  The staff works their tails off, and tries very hard to please!  Nice people serving so-so food.  The restaurant has been there a long time, looks clean inside and appears to have a strong group of locals that support them.    The search for a really good Chinese restaurant in Mesa continues..."}
{"text":"The General Tso's chicken lacked crispiness and flavor with a heat index of pre school. I had the Garlic chicken on a previous visit, and it was pretty tasty."}
{"text":"I was sadly disappointed with this place. I had the chicken chow mein and it had way too much teriyaki sauce. I felt crappy afterwards too. For the price I expected it to be much better. There are better Chinese restaurants in the area that are half the price and much tastier."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time yesterday.  The water was good no chlorine taste.  Rice fluffy  Food was good but we ordered the orange chicken, it was ok I wouldn't order it again but the spicy chicken dish was good and pork  fried rice was good.  All in all I would go again."}
{"text":"Open letter to the owner. It's been quite a while since I ate here -- and I'm not sure I ever will again -- because the waiter/manager guy would not give me your contact info. Or give you my contact info. I made a nice polite suggestion that he quickly said no to. And then asked if he could check with you about it, which he also said no to.  I hope he's not running your restaurant to the ground."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place. The chicken lo mein, and pork fried rice was excellent. The greeter was very busy when I walked in, and he even didn't skip a beat, he acknowledged everyone in the room, with a smile, while performing his job. I was very impressed with his customer service. This place was packed. That means, good food and service, we'll be back..5 stars!!"}
{"text":"We ate dinner here tonight. Service was friendly but short handed and the waiter actually answered the phone while taking our order.  Our guest also didn't get her glass of wine till well into our meal. There were four of us at the table and we all ordered something different.  The wonton soup was totally delicious but the rest of the dishes we ordered were just so so.  Very very small portions and very bland tasting, fresh but bland.   Definitely not worth the price either.  Too bad the food wasn't so good because the atmosphere was very nice. We may try it again someday but still looking for good Chinese in the East valley."}
{"text":"Been coming here since the 90's, David is always so personable and fun every time my family eats here or gets food to go! Food is consistently good and we've never had a bad experience!   If you are looking for good ol' American-Chinese food, this is the place to go in East Mesa."}
{"text":"Went in and asked for Sweet and sour pork. Pork wasn't seasoned and vegetables were way to large to eat."}
{"text":"This is a great little old school chinese restaurant.  They have pink linens, fake flowers, etc...it feels like a 1980s NY style chinese restaurant.  Aside from the decor, the food is good.  I enjoy their hot and sour soup, yum!  They are affordable and the portions are a good size."}
{"text":"Our party of five visited the restaurant on a Friday night, and we were seated promptly despite a fair number of guests.  The service was outstanding and professional...we never had an unfilled water glass, and our waiter was friendly and efficient  The food, however, was bland, most likely because Yen Ching is located in a retirement area and they know their audience.  I can't say that anything was particularly fresh-tasting.  All five dishes we ordered were swimming in mild, salty sauces.  It's no wonder that this is my 80-something year old father-in-law's favorite Chinese restaurant.  Also, they need to lose the dusty artificial plants and the generic muzak, otherwise the atmosphere was okay.  There are much better Chinese restaurants around town for food, but you can't beat the friendliness of the staff."}
