{"text":"My kids and I ate here yesterday for the first time. The ice cream was delicious and the pizza might be the best that I've had in the area. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Love the calzones, especially meatball and pizza here.  Also, even though it is listed as a seasonal item, a must try is the ice cream sandwich.  Super yummy homemade stuff.   Great for take out or eat in.  Friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood place, we always feel at home in the cozy dining room.  We like the subs, chicken wings/fingers, cavatelli bowls and especially the pizza squares.  But - I have to mention the ice cream - it's the BEST!!!  Just be sure to order a child size, it's more than enough. :)"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful local pizza place. There is a decent verity of pizzas as well as other food. It is a great place to eat with friends and family."}
{"text":"Soooo im disgusted by the way i revieved my drunk!!! Really!!!!???? You put a dirty can of pop ontop my ice iny cup!! REALLY!!???"}
{"text":"I came and ordered just a simple small cone with crunch coat expecting something small of course. Seems reasonable and I get this massive cone that is humongous and delicious. It honestly surprised me for the price I payed.  The customer service was also great and very very friendly. They don't take cards unless the order is over 5$ tho and since it was packed there wasn't a lot of seats. All in all I'd recommend to a friend :)"}
{"text":"I love the pizza but everything is delicious. Good prices and a friendly staff too!!"}
{"text":"Nothing too fancy. Just a great little neighborhood joint with great pizza and people who care about how it's made."}
{"text":"once, a few years ago, president bush was speaking at the kirtland farm park.  there was this big hoopla and all these people flocked to little ol' kirtland.  en route from the freeway, the motorcade had to pass angelo's pizza.  angelo's pizza had decked out the front of the restaurant, in support of president bush and the war.  i have never eaten their pizza since.  ...yep.  i'm *that* girl.  *addition* this angelo's is not affiliated with the angelo's that everyone loves out of lakewood.  different pizza joint.  end addition."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service, friendly staff.  We had salad,  deluxe pizza, pepperoni rolls and cheese pizza.  All was great! .  Only suggestion would be on the salad.  Mostly lettuce and cheese.  One cherry tomato and one slice of cucumber. Aside from that,  everything was great!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place doesn't get better reviews, as it's the best pizza in Aurora. The pizza is a thinner NY style, not as doughy as the other places in Aurora. I really like their sausage- no gross cat food pellet-style pieces but actual crumbled Italian sausage. I've had a sub from there before and it was decent too. Not the best pizza place in the world, but the best in Aurora."}
{"text":"Solid pizza for Ohio, Napoli's in Canton is yet to be dethroned as true NY style pizza in Ohio (as far as I have found - I lived in NY/NJ for 35 years) though, but this place is respectable.   We went here on a whim while we were at Aurora Farms doing some shopping.  We ordered a large pizza with mushrooms and onions and 2 waters with lemon.   The server was friendly and did a fine job.   The pizza was ready in like 10-15 mins max and came out piping hot.  Overall the pizza is good, better than a lot of the chain places for sure.   True NY style pizza, no but I give them a solid B- which for this state is pretty incredible because the pizza scene in good old Ohio is fairly weak.  Prices were good and the bill was cheap as far as I am concerned.   The place was clean and everyone was friendly!  I would definitely go here again and I would certainly encourage everyone to give them a try and reach your own conclusion.   Admittedly, I am a pizza snob, so some may feel I am being a bit hard on them."}
{"text":"I love the pizza here and the salads are great. My favorite thing on the menu? The chicken cutlets. We've ordered them for parties and they are always the first thing to go."}
{"text":"They claim to use the freshest ingredients far from that when asked if they make their pizza dough on site no it is frozen when looking at at their sauce they use comes in a can. Just not good very disappointed what a shame in a small town and can't get it rite Walmart frozen pizzas are better . Take the few extra minutes to go to Chesterland to guidos or go to Chardon to congins."}
{"text":"Friendly place, and good food. Pasta is good, pizzas are pretty good and calzones are good.  Salads are lettuce, couple of tomatoes, couple slices of cucumbers and a ton of cheese. But for sure, save room for the fried dough with powdered sugar."}
{"text":"I love Angelo's pizza.  I have patronized both the Kirtland and the Aurora restaurants and love them both.  I live in Bainbridge so I frequent the Aurora location more often and for carryout pizza.  It is the best pizza in this area for sure and it is also some one of the best tasting pizzas I have had. The owners are also very nice people!!"}
{"text":"Honesty alert - I've never made it past ice cream.  I want to I do - serious pizza lover right here - but when a small sugar cone is $3, massive and so creamy and rich - you never get inside.   Pumpkin is my favorite but only seasonal so the cookie dough becomes my go to...and if you have the room they literally serve the worlds best banana split - they even ask how you want it - traditional or sub out flavors for the ice cream - do the traditional and thank me (just after you thank them)."}
{"text":"WAS excited to try this pizza, but now I feel like I could've gotten mediocre pizza from dominoes or Pizza Hut. they charge 1.50 for each topping (we got a large pizza), whatever, but they skimp on the toppings. The service was meh, and when we got home to eat, the pizza tasted much like one of the frozen ones you'd get at a grocery store. It was also super greasy. I could only eat two slices after forcing myself to eat the second one. Probably won't finish the pizza so it's probably going in the garbage...Definitely do not recommend."}
{"text":"Very nice little Italian place. I usually only come to get ice cream but the pizza is good too. The service is rather slow especially because there were only 2 other people there besides me. I got a salad but when she gave it to me there was no cheese. I didn't say anything though. But... when I tried to order a pizza they said they were out of cheese. Seriously how do you run out of cheese!! So now I know why my salad had no cheese.  So now I basically couldn't order anything on their suuuperrr small menu so I left."}
{"text":"First you'll notice there is nobody eating inside.which says a lot about the food. Went to use a certificate that we got for Christmas,the owner was mad at us instantly,I guess he had a falling out with the company that was selling his certificates. I've had the pizza,it's not that good. The owner is a azzhole! Please go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Came in for a quick bite. We ordered a veggie calzone which I enjoyed a lot. Good marinara and plenty of cheese! Marietta is a welcoming, friendly server who makes you very comfortable to be there! Perfect sundae to top things off! Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Was here with a party of 16 recently and we all shared some pizza and salads.  The house salad was very good...so good we needed to order additional servings.  I thought the pizza was just okay....not bad but definitely didn't stand out either.  Our service was excellent as well, as 1 server handled our entire group and did so with friendliness and efficiency.  I would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Terrible. My wife ordered a chicken salad, day old chicken was over cooked and dry, they didn't put any dressing in order.  Pizza was damn near burned, I ordered a chicken Parmesan dinner, did not get my dinner salad,garlic bread was so over cooked it was hard and cold. Daughter had chicken wings and they were dry, and looked burned, but that is what happens with dirty oil. The only this was prepared good was the fried dough. Wasn't looking for anything Free. Just wanted to try and correct the orderCalled to complain and the owner /manager was arguing with me on the phone and basically called me a liar. He Only offered to give me a free pizza (small). Did not offer the dressing, or to make the order right. Will never come back."}
{"text":"I thought this place was a cool spot! We ordered calzones and drinks. I have to say these were probably the best calzones I've ever had. Freshly made dough. Lots of cheese, pepperoni and sausage. Yum yum yummy!! For driving through town briefly, It was especially great for on-the-go.  The staff was nice and efficient. You order inside and eat outside."}
{"text":"Good thin crust pizza. Great prices! Great music!   Cool Rat Pack decorations. Friendly staff.   University of Dayton flag? A bit out of place."}
{"text":"This is a local family owned business that our family frequents about a dozen or so times a year. They do deliver, and if you're in the mood to dine in, they have a basic checker tablecloth environment that's clean and not unpleasant along with a very limited beer and wine offering.   For me, the pizza is just a little on the boring side, but my kids and wife prefer it and they'll choose Angelo's every time (my wife's Italian, I'm not, she loves it, just an FYI). We tried a few different things tonight instead of pizza; Italian Sub, Turkey Sub, and ravioli.   Everything was good and the price in line with what we got. We also got a couple of salads which are made with Iceberg. Why not use romaine? Charge a little more, ya know. But the salads were simple and tasty, and their house made Italian dressing was lights out good."}
{"text":"Great NY style pizza! My family and I were out shopping and looking for a pizza place for a snack. We dined in and ordered a full on meal with cheesy bread and a cheese pie.  Delicious. Also I liked the decoration of the place with the old school movie posters.  Extra points for pleasant and friendly service."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and trying the local pizza joints.  I hate to say it but this one has been the worst.  We got a deluxe pizza and wings.  The pizza was so bland!  I like that it had thinner crust, but is was floppy with no crisp.  We asked that the wings be extra crispy and they were.  Overall they were ok but found it odd that the sauce came in the side.  Maybe it's just me but my pet peeve with pizza a canned mushrooms and that's what they used!!  Gross!  I just think for the price \"mom and pop\" places charge for pizza they should use fresh mushroom.  Won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Always great service and food! Love having it so close to home.  The food is always delicious, and I am a sucker for the ice cream in summer!"}
{"text":"This was a very last minute decision on our part as we are camping in the area and wanted pizza.  Hmmm....I am super on the fence...we got a thin crust deluxe on a Saturday around 3:00. Truth be told, it could have been more crispy (as ordered). The taste resembled Jets pizza. Since we only have pizza to eat until we get home, it's fine. Otherwise, I would not go out of my way to come back. Sorry."}
{"text":"I went with my boyfriend because we had a free pizza certificate and I paid online but there was no promo code on the certificate so I just brought it with me. I was very disappointed in their service. They refused to even try to refund one of the pizzas and told us to use it next time except it expired in a few days. They were just very rude and not accommodating . Additionally, their pizza was equivalent to a frozen pizza. We got white pizza and a sausage and banana peppers. They were very skimpy on their toppings and the sausage was like little sausage crumbles. Overall it was a disappointing experience which is surprising because it is hard to mess up pizza."}
{"text":"We were there with a group of 20 people. The service was excellent and the food phenomenal! The pizza flavors were delicious and the toppings were quality ingredients. I live an hour away and thoroughly enjoyed the drive up and the meal. Will be making a trip out again and Angelo's is on my list!"}
{"text":"My family loves this place. Great people and great food.  We love the pizza and the ravioli. They have great desserts as well. This is seriously a place where even picky eaters can be happy."}
{"text":"I've ordered a single large pepperoni pizza and an order of cheesy garlic bread to-go every time I've ordered from here. Super friendly staff and consistent speed and quality. The pizza is a New York style, larger and thinner pizza that most Midwest shops. Sauce is on the sweet side and the pepperoni has a little pop to it. The cheesy garlic bread is a split French bread hoagie that's been sent through the oven. Don't under estimate its simple composition, it's tasty.   If you're looking for a friendly place with pretty good pizza then you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Great food and wonderful service! We love it here and will keep coming back. Best ice cream and pizza in town!"}
{"text":"Great pizza place! Friendly staff, good pizza! Sauce is on the sweet side. Toasted ravioli is yummy. Good Italian dressing. Cute spot to eat!"}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. This location is a house that doubles as a pizzeria and ice cream Shoppe. There is an attached dining room but we ordered our double pepperoni pie to go.  Price wise a large 8 cut is right on par. The slices are bigger than most pizza restaurants. The pizza is thin crust, and the sauce is thin, acidic, and watery. The toppings slide right off of the pie. My husband and I did not care for this type of pizza.  An order of wings included 12 breaded fried wings. Definitely the type of frozen wings from Costco type stores. The mild sauce was in a container to pour on yourself. Angelos is nothing special. It reminded me of gas station or grocery store pizza. It could have been better."}
{"text":"The best Pizza in town, pick up or sit in. Nice patio too, staff is very friendly and attentive. Calzones and baked subs are the best."}
{"text":"Food was very good. When I went to pickup I noticed the kitchen was not very clean. Lots of flies and seemed like it could use a good scrub down and vacuuming. Staff was very pleasant."}
{"text":"If I could give it negative stars, I would. The absolute worst service of all time. I can't speak to the pizza because, after waiting 45+ minutes for our pizza, the waitress asked us if we had ordered a pizza. I told her yes. She came back and asked what we ordered. There were only two other tables seated in the entire place, both of which had been served their food already! And she wrote down our order! I WATCHED HER! She came back again and just muttered something about not knowing what happened but they didn't make our pizza. I asked for the bill for our drinks and salad and said F the pizza.   One star for the stellar, giant bowl of iceberg lettuce garnished with two slices of cucumber and a couple grape tomatoes. They call this exotic dish \"salad.\"  I've never left a restaurant more hungry than when I arrived before now. Maybe the proprietors should screen potential service employees by asking if they've ever set foot in a restaurant. This young lady clearly hadn't. (I've spared some of the annoying details, trust and believe this \"server\" was the portrait of incompetence.)"}
{"text":"Great pizza and very friendly service.  We have been getting pizza and calzones from Angelos for years and have never been disappointed.  The \"small\" made-to-order calzone is two meals for me and awesome when I reheat in the oven.  Pasta is above average and marinara is good.  Salads could use some improving but I am very picky about good salads.  Overall GREAT local place!"}
{"text":"My two stars here does not indicate bad - just very mediocre. I was pretty excited to head over to Angelo's with my son because it is close to my house and there were decent Yelp reviews. As I walked in I was greeted by a super nice lady who ended up ringing me out at the end. The Pizza was well constructed and looked great....but it wasn't. The crust was okay, the sauce,was okay, and the toppings were okay. There was nothing exciting about this pie and I probably won't return as most chains are just as good or even better. Sad because I prefer to buy from locals and not chains. Ah well..."}
{"text":"Went for lunch - $5 for pizza salad and pop. Friendly waiter served me. Has the feel of your Italian aunt and uncles house.   Delicious house dressing and very tasty pizza. I was told the fried dough is a local favorite but skipped this time. Will try next time I go"}
{"text":"Got a Chicago style a few months back and asked for it again and received a thick crust pepperoni. Good pizza could of got anywhere really wanted the CS. They make it real good or did  Gem"}
