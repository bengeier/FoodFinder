{"text":"Chose this place for lunch cuz it was a good mid-way point between BofA buildings and my friend who was working from home in the 4th Ward.  Also figured it would be a quicker alternative to QCDiner.  Sure enough, the sandwiches took about 15 minutes to get (it was just us 3 in the store), and the one person who ran the place forgot about one of my friend's orders / got confused who ordered what with what bread, etc.  So an awful place? Nah, the sandwiches were pretty good - almost great. Got a Korean, Bulgoki Beef Sub which was almost worth the wait/effort.  The tomatoes were super fresh, and there's as much of a drink variety as you could ask for since it's also a convenience store.  I probably won't frequent the place, but eh, maybe I'll swing by if im hungry for a korean sandwich and in the area.  Also there's no seating, but if you're fine without a table, ther're chairs across the street in the old cemetary."}
{"text":"I came here the other day to try the hyped up Korean food I heard was coming from a small little market on Church. The market smelled yummy inside but the food was okay -- didn't live up to the talk. Really friendly staff though!  It wasn't as crowded as I was expecting, which was great, but the wait was a bit long as there were only two people making orders behind the counter. There's a few things on the menu -- 5 or 6 -- so it's pretty easy to pick what you're in the mood for.  I ordered the Bulgogi Sub and my friend ordered Bap. The sub meat reminded me of Greek Gyro meat, which wasn't bad, but it was smothered in Mayo and melted cheese so it was a bit heavy with the sub bun included in the mix. The first couple bites were great but then it got to be too much. My friend said the Bap was pretty bland, but I never got to try it.  I would come here again to try different menu items but this place is no healthy lunch depending on what you get, so it'll be when I want to splurge. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here but if I was in the area again I might give it another try!"}
{"text":"I was brought here thanks to the posting on Charlotte Agenda's instagram page a few days ago. I work in Uptown Charlotte and after some mishaps with the lunch I brought from home, I went back through their post and decided on the new Avenue Market takeout. I believe the Korean Takeout is a recent addition to Avenue Market but done very well. Though the options are not extensive, they are very good! I had the Bulgogi Dupbap. I have had bulgogi before so it was  a familiar taste and done well. The portions for the take out plates are also very generous and in addition to the bulgogi you get a nice salad with ginger dressing and rice. You can order ahead and pick it up but it also only took about 3 minutes to get my food without pre ordering.  Needless to say, when I returned to my office break room there were many interested faces and I definitely had the best lunch :)"}
{"text":"I've driven past this place a bunch of times on my way to work. I had been craving beef bugolgi for a few days but didn't want to be overcharged like it's so common in Charlotte. You wouldn't expect it, but really great quality korean takeout in minutes. Also very nice people. 10/10"}
{"text":"Go here for great Korean lunch all under $10. The bulgogi sandwich is super tasty, and the rice plates hit the spot as well!   Great little mini grocery/market as well!"}
