{"text":"This is the first time I've ever been to Sammys and all I can say is wow! Delicious, fresh, great service! I wish there was a Sammys in San Diego. Def a great place for lunch!"}
{"text":"Well, this place is disappointing. Since the ownership change, the quality of food has gone down (portion size = smaller, price = same, lacking attention to detail, and uninterested employees). We visited here twice, and both times we felt let down. It's too bad because we used to eat here frequently (before the ownership change) but we won't be going back."}
{"text":"I should have know when I saw not a soul in this place on a Sunday afternoon, it wasnt a good sign. The menu is loaded with speciality sandwiches that its almost hard to pick out what to order. I ordered a #60 and there was still a full page of sandwiches left to choose from. We were told about how their bread is fresh daily, and they had a variety of meat selections (even vegan options). After ordering my sandwich i was greeted with a look of unfamiliarity. In fact our preparer had to grab a menu to find out what it was. While ordering, i was asked numerous times what i wanted on (lettuce, tomato etc). To which i replied i would like it as it comes. Again i was asked if i wanted lettuce etc...to which i replied no just as it comes with the spinach etc. Clearly he had no idea what was on the sandwich either. My daughter had a similar experience with her ordering. Not a good start. While waiting she was asked again from the preparers if she wanted the avocado that came on her sandwich. So frustrating!! As we left we were given a paper with their most popular sandwiches on it, that lead me to think those are the ones they know how to make. Once we got home, my sandwich was clearly not on fresh bread, the lettuce and spinach were both so wilted and old that i ended up picking it all off and the turkey was in shreds. Unlike any turkey i have ever had and not described that way on the menu. On a positive note the staff was friendly and i am hopeful that they can work out the bugs. I wont be going back and wont be recommending it to anyone. Good luck sammy shop!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely terrible! I ate here the other day and my sandwich had unripened avocado as well as extremely dry borderline stale thick bread. Never again!"}
{"text":"If you haven't tried this place you are missing out. The sandwiches are Amazing!  The flavor combinations are uniquely delicious. Try the Honey Badger, it's my new favorite."}
{"text":"I'm very happy to have rediscovered this place!!  Dylan suggested a Pastami, Bacon, Sourdough sub.  I asked for full size and it fed me for two meals!  Totally gourmet delicious.  The chip choices are ok, the cookies are amazing.  They should offer potato salad, lentil salad, cous cous, coleslaw, or pasta salad to go with the sandwiches.  How about a raspberry iced tea?  I want to support my local businesses and this one ranks high.  Delicious.  The service inside was exceptional.  Dylan and a young lady and a fun looking guy in a clean Mohawk all greeted me and I felt appreciated.  The place welcomes the hungry with care and a delicious product!  Good luck guys.  I recommend the place."}
{"text":"Advertised coupon was not honored. We ordered online and upon pick-up we were told \"you ordered the wrong thing\".  The sandwich was super dry, driest turkey I ever had, and the thick, stale bread was just gross.  $16 for a bad sub is just ridiculous.  We won't be visiting here again."}
{"text":"Today I ordered two sandwiches through grubhub. Sandwiches came faster than I anticipated, which was awesome. The food was really good, and generous portions even on the kinds meals. The sandwiches remind me of this awesome place in Tempe I usually drive out to when we need a sandwich fix, but now I know I can get my Gluten free sandwich right down the street. Awesome food."}
{"text":"I tried to place a to go (call ahead) order over the phone and the woman I talked to was impatient when I tried to go through the veggies options of what they offer on their subs. I would have understood if I called at a bad time, but when I went to pick up my food there were no customers. Not only was she impatient and unhelpful, but my sandwich did not come with anything I asked for and it came hot when I wanted it cold. My boyfriend's sandwich came as ordered because he did not add anything, but the pineapples and bacon on his \"diamond in the rough\" sandwich were so bad he had to take them off. I didn't get what I ordered and it was over priced for the quality of the sandwich. Seriously disappointed..."}
{"text":"I just came in here for lunch to get a sandwich to go and had the best customer service experience I think I have ever had. It's kind of sad that this kind of service is so rare these days. I watched them take care of a few other customers while I was in there with the same type of service as well. Just got home and the sandwich is pretty good. Reasonably priced and they have a lot of choices on the menu too. I will certainly be back."}
{"text":"3 parties in the place and it took a looooong time to get our sandwiches (we were the 2nd of 3 people to order).  Great guy taking orders, making sandwiches but that's the problem, there was only one person working there.  Sandwiches were average, certainly not gourmet.  It's a clean place, friendly service but they need to figure out how to make sandwiches faster and truly make them gourmet...too many other good choices around for less $ I'm afraid.  Good luck!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what happened with this shop, I'm assuming it changed ownership but I'm not positive.  First we got to the show and the guy working there and another guy were sitting in front of the shop smoking. (Didn't even know he was an employee because he wasn't wearing anything that would make you think he was, and was outside). 

Anyways, he followed us inside and got behind the counter. His breath and him reeked of cigarettes. Which is not something you want to smell by the person making your food.

Took about 8  minutes for our two sandwiches to be made. We got them. Went home. Took a bite. Gave the meat to my dogs and threw the rest away. 

There goes 21 dollars and 20 mins of my life."}
{"text":"We can't get enough of this place. My husband would come here everyday if I let him but we only eat out once a week and this place has been our choice for weeks now.  There are SO many vegan options for us so we try something new every time and it's always SO good. The bread is so perfect and the flavor of everything is incredible, especially the customer service. The guys and owner are super polite and helpful. This is how customer service and yummy food should be!! They make each sandwich so perfect!!! I am so glad we live close by :)"}
{"text":"Update 2: The owner, Joe won't quit. Received another nasty message calling me a liar, disrespectful, and rude. Someone can't take criticism. Lol. Aye. Some people need to get a life and shouldn't own businesses. Hope this place goes out of business. 

Update: Don't give this rude jerk your money! Since posting this review (which started out as 3 stars) the owner reached out to me via private message and was rather rude to me. If you read the response to Mrs. B's review on here he was rude to her too. What a jerk! Anyway, he accused me of asking for a refund, which I didn't and blasted me for not tipping the driver (which I planned to do after the fact providing the service was good--it wasn't). In so many words he said that delivering to me was too difficult and too far (not sure why it's offered then). He also blamed me for the type of sandwich I ordered saying that I ordered one with no veggies and no condiments...ok, granted but if you're going to offer a sandwich like that, be open to feedback and to possibly changing it up. Some people should just not own businesses or deal with the public. It sucks because I need a reliable delivery place for when I get bogged down with work and don't have time to go get food. I thought this was it...but not if I'm going to receive rude messages from a jackass. Bye Sammy Sandwich Shop! 
--
Ordered this for takeout again today and this time I was less than pleased. First off, the delivery took a really long time! I placed the order at 12:45 pm and it didn't get here until almost 2:30pm. C'mon, if you're going to charge $4.00 for delivery, make it fast! 

I got the vegan club sandwich and it's currently not agreeing with my stomach. I really hope it is vegan and they didn't make a mistake or there is something on there that they think is vegan when in reality it contains egg or something. Anyway, the avocado they used on the sandwich was not even close to being ripe and was really hard...almost crunchy. Disappointing since I paid like $12 for this thing. The sandwich itself was extremely dry as it didn't have any mayo or mustard on it, just vegan chicken, vegan bacon, vegan cheese, and avocado. I feel I paid $12 for a $6 sandwich. 

My order was complete this time, which was nice. I think next time I'll go to the actual location to scope it out and try a different sandwich."}
