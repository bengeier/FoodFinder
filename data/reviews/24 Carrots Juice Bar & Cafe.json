{"text":"My first impression was very disappointing. Ok, to give them the benefit of the doubt, their register crashed causing their disorganization. There wasn't a lot of people though and the four of us only ordered juices/smoothies. How hard is that?! I also ordered one of their chocolate balls from their bakery. 
They forgot it, so I had to go back up to the register to ask about it. The guy was apologetic and said he's bring it right over, which he did. 
Everyone got their smoothies and juices but me. I remained patiently waiting until my friends finished their drinks. I realized they forgot me again. I went back to the register and notified the girl there that I never got my cucumber cooler. She apologized, they made it right then and there and gave it to me. 
I was a little annoyed at all this.. So much that my review so far is solely based on customer service. 
While waiting I did have a sip of the Good Juju and berry smoothie. They were both delicious. This is the reason I might come back, but if the service is the same I certainly won't."}
{"text":"Best place to grab a quick snack!  Or come in and sit down for a nice meal in a calm relaxing environment.  Sasha and Amanda are amazing!  Amanda is one of the best vegan/vegetarian chefs EVER!! They are always helpful in picking out new items to try and have new items every week!"}
{"text":"Spent a whole night puking my soul out, and could literally feel the life returning to me as I drank one of their protein smoothies and a minestrone soup."}
{"text":"If you are vegetarian coz you actually like veggies, this is the place for you.

You can actually taste the vegetables. And the food is fantastic. It rivals True Foods and is priced much better. 

Sasha is such a friendly person, loved talking to her.

And if you cant tolerate vegetables and have given up hope, this is the place for you ! 

They actually promote local, organic and healthy eating. They conduct events like classes from time to time. I have had the pleasure of attending a class as well.

Amazing food and philosophy !"}
{"text":"No. No no no.

It's places like this that give veganism, vegetarianism, and frankly vegetables, a bad name. 

We went here for Mother's Day and boy was it a mistake. 

We ordered the hummus to start which had about 1.5 tablespoons which wasn't even enough to dip all the vegetables we were given. Also it wasn't good. I had the BLT which was bland and had a weird taste. I also ordered the apple soyrizo hash which had no soyrizo in it and when I asked I was told it's just the flavor. Well then don't put that in the name of the item and also then where is the flavor coming from?? 

My brother had the avocado quinoa bowl and it was tasteless and missing items like black beans and my mom had the blueberry French toast... The toast was literally just toasted and there were barely any toppings, in fact she had to ask for more to make it edible. Also the free mom-mosa that was to come for my mom took 45 mins: ridiculous. 

Apparently the smoothies are good so my recommendation is - make it a smoothie bar... Smoothies, coffees, dessert.. That'd be great.  But don't do food. I cook vegan food and it can be delicious. This was not that. And it was way overpriced for what it was. 

Someone did come over to ask us how it was and when we told her she offered to refund us, which we declined, or give us a gift certificate which we did accept.. But that's always like cool your food was bleh gimme more! We may return to try something else but well see. Not in a rush. 

We got Baskin Robbins after. Can't go wrong there."}
{"text":"What a great local joint! 24 Carrots is exactly the sort of business Chandler residents need to support. My first long overdue visit was extremely satisfying. The owner Sahsa was extremely helpful and gave us a little insight into how 24 Carrots became what is it to day. You can tell she is really passionate about the food and drink she dishes out to her guests. 

My girlfriend and I went in for lunch this past Saturday and were able to get an extremely satisfying meal for a fair price. We tried the French toast (which was a special) that had kiwi, pomegranate seeds, cashew cream and real maple syrup on it. All 100% vegan and 100% percent. We also tried the eggs benedict which came with homemade vegan bacon, avocado, vegan egg (it even had a \"yolk\" and aioli. Definitely a stunner. 

Our Peachy Keen smoothie was also a healthy and delicious way to start off our meal. 

For the price, the portion size, the quality, the friendliness and atmosphere I give 24 Carrots a 5 out of 5 and look forward to coming here again be it for breakfast, lunch or just to grab a fresh juice."}
{"text":"I go to 24 carrots very often because I love their fresh, healthy, unique dishes! One of their servers is also extremely nice and helpful! The reason I am here writing this review right now is because multiple times I've gone to 24 Carrots, the service has been absolutely terrible! Today when I went there was the straw that broke the camel's back! We ordered two sets of pancakes, but when we got them, they appeared a bit burnt. It wasn't until we flipped them over that we saw how really burnt they were! How can you even serve pancakes that burnt to your customers?! It was obvious that the cook had to have known he had burnt them too! He just tried to hide it! Then when we asked if they could remake them, the servers were very apologetic and understanding, but as we watched the servers tell the cook about the mistake, he raised his hands in the air above his head in annoyance! Why should HE be mad that HE made a mistake and now has to fix it?! We ended up getting new pancakes that were better and weren't burnt. I love 24 Carrots so much, and it pains me to write a bad review, but after several instances of bad service, it gets old, and something needs to change! I didn't pay $20+ for burnt pancakes! I hope things change for the better because I don't want to experience this anymore."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite vegan restaurant! Their smoothies are to die for, they have so many juice options, and their food is creative and delicious! I was very happy with their service. Our cashier was smiling and happy to answer my questions and our server was prompt and polite. I plan on coming back as often as I can."}
{"text":"It took me 25 minutes to walk out the door and almost late to work.. with two \"smoothies\"...There was only one other person waiting for theirs in front of me and I waited for that long just for two smoothies. There were two people \"working\" behind the counter. I regret that I paid almost six dollars for some juice put in a blender and mixed up. WORST smoothie I have ever had in my life. I've made better smoothies out of my own kitchen. I will never ever set foot back in this place. HORRIBLE slow service, OVERPRICED and the smoothies did NOT make up for it at all."}
{"text":"24 Carrots is terrific.  The juice, food, and atmosphere are great.  Sasha is always working on something new.  Today, she told me about a new veg style Thanksgiving sandwich she's working on.  I'll be sure to try that out once available.  Love it!"}
{"text":"After a long hike we found this place on yelp. We arrived during happy hour, great prices!!!  Delicious choices good for both us and the environment."}
{"text":"If you're looking for vegetarian restaurants in Phoenix that are also vegan-friendly, you're gonna love 24 Carrots Juice Bar & Cafe. Read my recommendation: http://directory.veganish.org/vegetarian-restaurants-in-phoenix-24-carrots/"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! I have been a vegetarian for over 20 years, and it is nice to finally see so many vegetarian/vegan restaurants sprouting up all over the valley.  I ordered green juice (I forget the name) and mushroom quesedillas.  They were very tasty with fantastic texture and flavor that just popped in your mouth.  The owner of 24 Carrots goes around the valley each week talking to different local farmers to see what products they have.  Their products are the epitome of locally grown, which I really appreciate.  The food is a bit pricey, but I am willing to pay a bit more for local, organic, healthy food.  My one complaint was the noise.  Of course, I have accepted the sad reality that noisy restaurants are \"in,\" with their glass and stone surfaces and nothing to buffer the noise.  However, because smoothies are so popular at 24 Carrots, there was an almost constant din of blender in the background.  I would suggest that they make the smoothies in the back kitchen to cut down the noise."}
{"text":"I highly reccomend this place. The food/drinks are so pure. You leave here feeling good about yourself and what you've put into your body. I have a gluten allergy and am vegan on top of it so finding places that I can eat at is a challenge and finding places that are friendly as well as accomidating is even harder...Sasha, the owner is genuinly interested in your diatary needs and will adjust accordingly and is happy to do it. From changing an ingredient to baking completely custom granola she has been wonderful in making me feel comfortable that my needs are met. ...and on top of that the food/drinks are delicious!!!!! I can't get enough of this place! Everything I've had has been amazing...but I highly reccomend the apple ginger juice and any of the soups. Wonderful place!"}
{"text":"Sorry but this place has horrific customer service and subpar food. 2 stars because we did finish the food, but wouldn't come back. 

We got the Buddha bowl, cauliflower wrap and carob maca latte. The latte was pretty good, cauliflower wrap was ok- mostly just because it was a bit spicy. The Buddha bowl tasted of nothing. Needed salt and more curry spices.

When we asked to switch for something else, they laxadasically asked us what was wrong with it. Then it took ages for us to get our replacement of a BLT, which was ok. I wouldn't rush back to have it. Their food is also quite overpriced for the portion size. 

I have worked for probably a decade in food/hospitality and I was extremely disappointed by the service we received. First of all, the guy who served us at the register was the least enthusiastic person I have come across this year. Unfortunately we did tip, and now I wish I could take that back. We asked what was good since it was our first time coming in, he essentially told us to just read the menu. 

Secondly, when you aren't happy with food, it's not nice to be questioned as if it is our taste buds that are wrong. And then when you ask to switch to another meal, that meal should be expedited. It clearly wasn't so one of us finished food before the other, not a great experience. 

Lastly, when we got our replacement BLT we were given it in a to go box. If I was working and someone did that, I would tell them to put it on a place. It comes across as very rude. I couldn't wait to leave and actually headed out as I was taking my last bite. Didn't feel welcomed or like the service was in any way genuine. Maybe this is how you guys roll in Arizona, maybe I'm just used to California.. but I just hope this isn't the best that vegan food gets here. 

The guy who seemed to be in charge did admit that the curry sauce wasn't quite right today- people, this is why managers do line checks and taste sauces daily. Overall I just really felt like no one particularly cared to be there, to cook, to serve, etc..

Yelp, you let us down."}
{"text":"Love this new-ish local eatery and juice bar. They just moved and are already running smoothly. Great food. Family friendly. Loved the Cucumber Cooler juice and the BBQ unchicken and lentil quesadilla. Also got the raspberry coconut bread pudding yum! Most of all love the people. Thanks 24 carrots!"}
{"text":"NOTE: This review is only about the smoothies/juices

Sadly I really wanted to like this place, because I've been looking for a decent local juice bar...and I apparently still have yet to find a good one! I decided to order 2 juices. but couldn't find one that screamed ginger (I love ginger), so I asked the girl behind the counter what she would recommend and she mentioned that they can add ginger to any of the drinks. I decided to get the Pucker Up! and Berry Me Alive, both with ginger. I was hoping to get a small to try, but the size didn't seem worth it for $4.50 plus extra for ginger, so I got both in a medium size. 

The Pucker Up did make my lips pucker but not in a good way. It was bland and sour and I could feel my stomach acids churning. The Berry Me Alive tasted like a cup of frozen berries. Yes, I know frozen fruits are practical in such places, but I've never had berries that tasted so lack-luster. Also, I don't know how much ginger I get for 50 cents, but it wasn't enough because I couldn't even taste it.

For 2 medium drinks plus ginger, the total can to about $13. So not worth it! Don't plan to ever waste my money here. I'll just drive to Thrive in Gilbert for now."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place, but truthfully i'm not sure it's worth the wait and the money. I've been here quite a few times, but my past experience may be the last.

 My frustration mostly arises from stopping by at 2:30 on mother's day for some juice. The place was packed, but mostly from people waiting for their lunch. I saw a lot of angry customers waiting more than an hour for their food. My mom decided she didn't want to wait for food and we both order juices. IT TOOK 30 minutes for the juice. JUST JUICE!! The lady making our juice didn't look like she had a clue how to make the juice in the proper portions, tossing veggies and fruits in there like an experiment! It took her 3 times to get it right with her wasting time running back and forth to the back to grab more veggies. Not only does this NOT make sense, but it's a HUGE waste of time. Plus the veggies did not look washed at all. First of all, get a formula down so workers know just about how many veggies go into a drink. Second of all, keep them somewhere close to the juicer! DUH!!! During our wait we saw MANY frustrated customers, complaining they received the wrong orders, or things were missing, and asking why their food was taking so long. People, the food is pretty good, but not worth a 2 hour wait. In this day and age, time is crucial when considering where to go grab a meal. 24 carrots really needs to figure out a way to maximize the time or motivate workers, because honestly I was frustrated by their staff. No organization, and streamlining the food and juice making process needs to happen. 

By the time we got our juices, I really didn't even enjoy it. The time and money we wasted waiting, sweating--does their AC work at all?? --was just not worth it. Sorry 24 carrots. I've given you 3 chances. I'm not looking to be disappointed any further."}
{"text":"My first time here and it was great.  Service was good.  We had a breakfast burrito and quesadilla that was substantial and filled with very tasty fresh harvest vegetables.  For vegans, this is the place, a full vegan menu, not just options.  Forget the chain restaurants around the corner. This is the real fresh thing.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I don't normally eat raw or vegan but I had the raw tacos and they were awesome. My friend had one of the sandwiches and really enjoyed it. The deserts for the day were raw and gluten free. This place is perfect for those with dietary restrictions. The service was a bit slow but come to find out everything, including our iced tea, was made fresh. 
I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! Every time I go the food is delicious, fresh and so flavorful!!! Going more plant based eating isn't so hard when you have an awesome place like this to eat and learn from!! The staff is very kind an knowledgeable!  Can't wait to go back!! Ginger"}
{"text":"Love their smoothies (Ultimate recovery-my fave!) and juices (field of greens)  Happy hour= 1/2 off drinks.  My kids who roll their eyes at the thought of eating vegan, love their vegan burgers, and quesadillas.  Great tasting food, healthy, and great service.  Food is made from scratch...this is not fast food, so expect a small wait.  Food that you can feel good about eating."}
{"text":"I used to frequent several of the vegetarian/vegan/raw/organic establishments in NYC and now back in Arizona, I was hoping to find comparable fare. Let me say that this place holds a candle to absolutely all of the places I had been to in NYC, and without the inflated prices and ostentation I had encountered out east. Nutritionally conscious Arizonans should consider themselves lucky to have an establishment like this which provides foods sourced locally, ethically, organically, and most importantly for me, THAT TASTE OH SO GOOD. The food here is just straight blissful---whether you're a meat-eater, vegetarian, vegan, raw-curious, any of the above--they really make an effort to appeal to all of the palates, I noticed. The tastes and colors are so vibrant and every dish I had was done with care and craftsmanship. Everything came together on the dishes; nothing seemed to clash--a sign that there is a good deal of culinary ingenuity behind the restaurant concept. I oftentimes wonder why people even need meat or dairy when vegan food can be made to taste this irresistible. So far I have had the Juevos Rancheros, the Smoked Bacon BLT, their house veggie burger, and a special of the day, an enchilada dish. I honestly don't understand any of the negative reviews; they seem trifling and unsubstantial. Recognize the overarching reality that you are getting some of the very best quality nutrition possible prepared sooo yummily. To me, that's all that matters. Like I said, I would recommend this just as enthusiastically as some of the best vegan/vegetarian/raw/organic establishments in NYC, and that's saying something. I salute you 24 carrots, and I wish you luck in your continued awesome output of cuisine. Count on me to be a regular!

Note: Being a tall male, I have a voracious appetite and sometimes I will order two dishes, but I have no problem with this. People have different requirements and I don't criticize their portions as being meager. They are appropriately sized portions."}
{"text":"The staff at 24 are really sweet and give great recommendation. I had the raw nori rolls they were a 4/5. Quite gArlicy but the lemonade with ginger wad so good. They r such a small restaurant, not fancy at all. Go for lunch thou not din."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegan or vegetarian but this place is AWESOME! They have very creative vegan dishes. You won't miss the meat or cheese. The produce they use is fresh and crisp. The service is a bit slow but it's worth the wait!
Great breakfast burritos!"}
{"text":"While I found everything to be satisfying, it wasn't very memorable. The only real problem is that they don't serve coffee. They are not allowed to because they are next to a Starbuks. That's some b/s on the part of Starbucks, but nonetheless, I wouldn't put a breakfast spot next to one."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stumbled across 24 Carrots this past weekend while in Tempe and thank God we did because this place is amazing! The restaurant itself is super cute but their extensive menus are the best part! Sasha, the owner, came over to our table to introduce herself and was hands down one of the sweetest, most passionate people I have ever met. I just.wish I lived closer to this restaurant so I could visit more often!"}
{"text":"It was so nice finding this unique alternative for healthy eating in Tempe. I do not have any diet restrictions but a close friend of mine does, so finding places to eat can be difficult. I enjoyed their grilled cheese sandwich, which taste great but not really liked grilled cheese. I would still tell you for try it though as it was very tasty. My friend loved her soft tacos. So far I would recommend for people who are trying to eat more healthy but also have family/friends with diet restrictions like no dairy/gluten. I wish their was more places to eat like 24 carrots."}
{"text":"Delicious food, tasty drinks, phenomenal desserts and friendly staff.    Love this place"}
{"text":"I was on my way to Starbucks next door but this place caught my eye and decided to take a look - boy I'm glad I did.

- I recommend wholeheartedly the Pitta Pizzas and the Pomme Zinger Juice (freshly squeezed apple juice and ginger).

- It's got free wifi so I spent the afternoon working there and got to know Sasha (the owner) - she's lovely!

- Don't expect Subway-style fast service. The food and the juices are made from scratch and this takes time (give me good food over fast food any day though).

I'm now a regular and I plan on going through everything on the menu."}
{"text":"This is my first time eating here though I have had their food at various festivals, and have always been impressed. I can't wait to come back and try everything! I highly recommend this place.
Everything was clean in the restaurant and bathroom. The woman taking my order was very friendly, and the food tasted so fresh. Everything had a lot of great flavor. 
It's a very casual and bright atmosphere with indoor and outdoor seating. I could see meeting friends here for some relaxing conversation and great food."}
{"text":"I love places like this over the chain restaurants that dominate the Valley.  The food is fresh, unique, and best of all healthy.  I'm not a vegan or even a vegetarian, but I always find something great to eat here.  Their strawberry lemonade and pina coladas are my favorite!  I love their vegan cheeseburgers and zuccini spaghetti.  

I recently cut dairy out of my diet due to some food allergies and have had a difficult time eating out ever since.  It's so nice to be able to walk into a restaurant and have the employees know exactly what is in the food they're serving you.  It's nice to tell someone you'd like your food to be dairy free and not have to elaborate beyond that.  I stop by here as often as I can whether it's for lunch or a quick smoothie."}
{"text":"The food here is wonderful and I am never disappointed! The owners are so friendly and the food is soooo flavorful. I was also happy to learn that they cater! I loved the vegan eggs benedict and the chicken salad sandwich is delicious. One time I had a tomato soup that was to die for. I am so happy to have stumbled upon this restaurant and plan on spreading the word!"}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and found this place by searching 'Vegan' on yelp. I'm in heaven! Ordered a carrot / pomegranate / kale / cucumber juice and it was delicious.  The owner is super friendly. We're here a few more days and will be back to try some of the food."}
{"text":"AMAZING food and service!!! Yesterday I tried the Spicy Buffalo Wrap for the first time and absolutely loved it. The food is so fresh, flavorful, and extremely filling. My food came out within 5 minutes, the fastest I've ever been served anywhere. 24 Carrots had a fresh and welcoming atmosphere. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"My first experience here was not good but a I gave it another shot. The food is ok not bad and not great just ok so nothing to go out if your way for its also very expensive for what you get. I got the vegetable scramble from the breakfast menu and was disappointed in how oily everything was, barely any vegetables and ofcourse my order was messed up. The reason I am giving it such low ratings is when I asked twice when ordering whether a dish was GF and was told yes several times. When the dish came it had toast which was a main component and I again asked and ofcourse it wasn't. They then told me they could switch it for GF bread but I would have to pay for it even though it was their mistake! Good thing the nice guy at the register probably realized how ridiculous this was when I tried to go pay for it and told me to not worry about it. Sad to say I won't be going back as it just doesn't deliver in any aspects."}
{"text":"I am going to update my review since the owner sent me a nice little message and explained the reason for the microwaves. I totally respect the amount of work she puts into her food everyday, and I really appreciated that she took the time to explain all of her cooking processes and limitations in her kitchen. I also appreciate how kind she was about it. I have seen posts from owners from other restaurants bashing customers for having an opinon. Its refreshing to see an owner who does the exact opposite. Knowing now that the microwaves are used only to boil water I feel better knowing that what I ate was not cooked in the microwave. I will definaly be back to try out all of your other breakfast dishes!     4/26/11

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I came in here really wanting to love this place. I am always looking for more vegan places to eat because my ultimate goal is to go completely vegan sometime in the near future. We came in at around 8:30 on Saturday morning. That is one thing I have to say about their Saturday hours. Everywhere except their Facebook page says they open at 11 on Saturdays, and even the sign outside of the store says they open at 11, but they actually open at 8 on Saturdays. We might have been the first people in there because of this. And nobody came in after us until about 9:15. Maybe people are confused about the hours? I don't know. But from the reviews on this place I expected it to be jumping. I know every time I go to Pomegranate Cafe this early its packed. So maybe update your website and sign out front? Just a suggestion. 

Anyways, so we walked in and ordered. I got the vegan eggs benedict, and my husband got the tofu scramble and one of the smoothies. So we sit down and wait for our food to come out. Now I don't want to be picky, but this is one of the things I notice when I walk into a place. Its small, yes. That doesn't bother me. It just didn't feel clean to me. Most of the tables had stuff all over them and weren't cleaned right. There was dust all over everything. And a giant dead mosquito watched me pretty much my entire breakfast from the window where he was caught in a spiders web. For a place this size, there really shouldn't be any reason why it was a dirty as it was. Maybe that doesn't bother some people, but I was put off by all of the dust. 

The other thing I noticed that really bugged me, is how many times I heard them open and close the microwave. Aren't restaurants supposed to use pots and pans? I don't think I heard the sound of a pot clanging one time. And I have stopped going to restaurants in the past because I found out they use microwaves. If I want to use a microwave, I'll go home and cook myself. I didn't come here to pay ten dollars for breakfast, for it to be made entirely in the microwave. Honestly, I would rather wait an hour for breakfast so it can be made on the stove, than to have it done in ten minutes out of a microwave. 

So after about 15 to 20 minutes our food comes out. It is a lot more than I thought it was going to be. I had two pieces of toast with four pieces of tofu bacon, then topped with two tofu \"eggs\" with avocado and garlic aoli. It was served with a salad and fresh fruit. The salad was a little odd for breakfast, but it tasted good. I liked the dressing and sunflower seeds. I really liked the eggs benedict. It had a good flavor and even for as much food as it was I ate everything on my plate. My husband also liked his scrambled tofu which came with toast and jam, fresh fruit and two pieces of tofu bacon. For ten dollars you really do get what you pay for. 

I really want to come back here because I did like the food, however I don't know that I will knowing how much they do use the microwave. Maybe some people don't care about that, but I do. Perhaps, I will just have to come back and try their raw options. But really, get rid of the microwave!"}
{"text":"this is definitely my favorite vegetarian place near phoenix. it's 20 minutes from my house, but it's well worth the drive. the food is fresh, and although it will take a bit of time to make (if you get something hot), it's worth it. the smoothies are also to die for... i usually get the strawberry fields forever with a protein boost. in addition, i would recommend getting the arizona bowl or the eggs benedict, i love them. however, if you want to be daring... they have a daily menu on a board."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place! Yum Yum! Sasha is lovely to chat with - great with suggestions! Highly recommend the specials...like the yummy burgers..."}
{"text":"RUDE EMPLOYEE!!!!! I went into this juice bar one morning in a hurry. First impression, EXPENSIVE for a juice and you needed glasses to read the tiny written menu. The smoothie I ordered was $7.50 (quite a lot I would say). I ordered from the girl standing behind the counter, then the phone rang. She proceeded to take the call to discuss daily sales and how much the shop was making each day with the person on the other line. She did not apologize or excuse herself while taking this call. As I waited she walked around cleaning things up while on the phone. (No, not starting to make my smoothie, just talking on the phone about how much money the place is making, REALLY?) The person with me never got to order, we both walked out, no time in my day for that. Better tell that owner they just lost 2 smoothie sales that day and possible repeat customers."}
{"text":"Just ate there. Food was bland and flavorless. We had to go and get a menu to verify what we ordered, as the menu claimed it came with certain things and toppings which did not make it to our plates. The burger has like warm mush that faintly tasted like potatoes. Salad unimpressive as well unfortunately.  $30 down the drain. Tempe and Phx has better options out there we hope..."}
{"text":"The only reason I am not giving this restaurant 5 stars is because of the amount of oil they used. The food and coffee was so delicious, but oh my goodness, the oil was extremely overwhelming. I eat gluten free because I do not like to feel heavy and weighed down after a meal, but that was not the case today with my burrito. I ended up giving it to my husband who doesn't mind oil and it was even too much for him. 

Loved that they have books to read and toys for kids to play with. 

Will definitely go back. I will just be sure to order something without oil or request that they don't use it."}
{"text":"Best vegan/vegetarian place in Tempe! Everything is great on their menu! However my favorites are the Incrddible Hulk smoothie, their pastries, and jalepeño poppers. You won't be disappointed with anything though!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love, love this place. From great customer service to quality food, there's nothing to complain about, really. Except maybe I wish there's membership to this place so I can just eat here every single night. If you are in a mood for an amazing vegan food, this is the place to be. If you're not really crazy about vegan food, this will make you want to change your diet and just be 24-Carrots fanatic like me! PS- don't forget to try their desserts because that will just make your experience even greater."}
{"text":"Veganism (let alone raw vegan) isn't nearly as trendy as it used to be, so options in the Valley are consequently dwindling. I'm thrilled 24 Carrots is carrying the torch! Nothing in Whole Foods (where I usually go for such dishes) compares to what I could eat here--for example, the raw vegan cheesecake is fresh, creamy, and packed with flavor; the ones at Whole Foods are waxier, likely because they aren't as fresh. I also loved the pineapple express: totally fresh, which far exceeds cold pressed, bottled fare sold for the same price in health food stores. 

The food is absolutely fantastic, and the portions are massive. The prices are a bit high, but well-justified given the freshness, quality of ingredients and portion size. I can't complain about the price. 

I had the Arizona bowl and it was big enough to serve as two separate meals. It was lovely, filling and nourishing food. I also had the raw vegan carrot soup. It had a good bite and nice flavor profile, though it could have been creamier and richer. This could be achieved by nuts, but even just by blending a Vitamix for a bit longer.

The only complaint was that it took a little while to get my food. The deliciousness and freshness was worth it but such time can be hard to bear with a baby in tow. Props to the kids corner stacked with books and toys though. Very cool and rare to find in restaurants. 

Excellent food all around. I can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Am not a big fan of their food but I love love love their smoothies.

Maybe they should just focus on things that they are good at. 

Why not just keep to smoothies and carve out a niche in that."}
{"text":"Today was the first time I tried this restaurant and I loved the food!  The service was quick and the place was clean and spacious.  I'm looking forward to eating here again."}
{"text":"Bad service, small portions and overpriced! Just go to pomegranate cafe instead, it's pricey too but at least they give you what you pay for."}
{"text":"I stopped in and enjoyed a Berry Me Alive. Excellent smoothie and without all of the fillers most places put in (but still just as creamy and good!). The owner Sasha was super friendly and informative.  

The menu looks amazing and I can't wait to go back and try them for lunch!"}
{"text":"Finally a vegan restaurant in Tempe!  I love their food.  They have a vegan breakfast burrito with bacon (tofu bacon that is), carrots, cabbage, sweet potatoes, tofu, cauliflower. I know, it sounds a little weird, but it is really good.  They also have lunches, juices and vegan desserts."}
{"text":"Good yummy healthy vegan food!"}
{"text":"24 Carrots Juice bar is not only a very clever play on words, but truly symbolizes the high quality, freshness and purity of the juices served at this brand new store! This little store hopefully will make ripples in this community with high quality organic drinks, low fat foods, an eco conscious attitude, and passion to serve the community.

Many folks initial reaction when they initially hear about this is \"Why is this different from Jamba Juice\" or any xyz run of the mill place? What they don't realize is that owners of 24 Carrots have created a true line of \"All FRUIT\" juices which has NO ice, no concentrate, and no junk in it at all, unlike most smoothies that carry 2/3 ice, cost almost as much, and are not nearly as flavorful, fresh or good for your health! Plus, you never get the watery taste in your juice no matter how long you take to sip and enjoy it - it stays fresh, fruit and tasty till the last drop!

Like try out their  mango drinks with the freshest mango fruit blended in each cup, or their signature carrot juice which is beyond what your taste buds imagine of a carrot juice as its blended with several fruits that leaves you craving for more!
 
Beyond the juices, try out the owners secret homemade receipe of granola which has become an instant hit in my family and workplace because not only is it much better tasting than most granolas out there, it has less oil, fat, its organic and best of  all there are no pre-toasted ingredients! Everything is made from scratch and made with love! You are what you eat they say...

The owners of 24 carrot make you feel welcome, will blend your drink to your liking, and provide a comfortabe relaxed ambience at their store with pleasant colors, comfortable sofas, and access to a free internet connection while you sip your heavenly fruit juices or enjoy a taste of true homemade indian teas. 

But you know what, don't just take my word for it, go out there and check out the juices, granolas, and tasty yet healthy goodies for yourself!"}
{"text":"I want to love this restaurant. That's why I kept trying to go, even after I'd been disappointed several times. I like and want to support small businesses-- especially vegan businesses. 

Unfortunately, the time it takes for food to get to me has always been too long (even at the old location). I absolutely agree with another yelp review that noticed that the prices are getting higher or staying the same while portions have been greatly decreased. The food is just ok. 

For the same price I can go to Pomegranate and not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Friendly service and incredible, healthy food! I was driving through Chandler on business and was looking for a non-chain restaurant to grab a quick bite. They were kind and welcoming, passing out smoothie samples and asking how my falafal burger was (very good.) They revamp the menu every week based on what fresh ingredients they've bought at the local Phoenix farmers markets. I was they had a location in L.A."}
{"text":"One Word sums up this place- AMAZING!!! I don't care if you are a carnivore or a vegan this place has something for everyone and everything is DELISH!! It does take a little longer than most places but its worth it. Small and quaint with simple ambiance, but a little gem that offers a nice variety and daily specials - Also, their RAW desserts are insanely good and good for you!"}
{"text":"Went there yesterday and loved the caprese salad with mozzarella, tomatoes, mixed greens, and pesto dressing. Delicious! And they are always so incredibly friendly here. A little pricey but worth it because you can be sure you are eating healthy food made with high-quality, ingredients many of which are locally grown and/or organic."}
{"text":"First time I get to 24 Carrots and the place was closed for interviews.  Next day I showed up at 11:30 a.m and the place was unkept, the pastry case was empty.  I asked if there was any pastries.  Sasha, stated busy morning...........really! you have a business and you don't have any back up for your pastry case? WoW, first impression counts and we are not going back.  It's early and they are out of pastries!  I keep thinking they were just having a bad day, but the place didn't have a sign outside.  It just didn't look like they didn't care.   So I'm a newbie at raw dishes, any suggestions? Nope, don't expect to get any at this place, you will be on your own.  You grab the menu from a stand and figure it out yourself.  It is nothing like the beautiful pictures on the website or facebook...........very deceiving. So, I ordered the Taco Supreme which took forever to get, and it was missing the avocado which states on the menu avocado etc.....didn't get it.  This place disappoints big time.  Our recommendations for starters, get pictures next to your dishes on the menu or an overhead sign with prices and keep your pastries stock 24/7 remember, first impression counts. The water jug with cucumbers, stock cups next them so people don't have to ask for them.  Finally, you need to make up your mind what hours you are going to keep the business going.  You keep changing the hours.  You advertise on your website 8 am. to 2pm but you change the times making it  impossible to ever make it when it is opened and some of us drive from far to experience your food and last but not least  keep it clean and groom well, Sasha and her employees looked sweaty and  disgusting.  This is a restaurant everyone should look clean and presentable.  THE FOOD PICTURES ARE DECEIVING!"}
{"text":"Place is hippie, almost too much so.  The dining room and bathroom need cleaning. Otherwise the juices are tasty and made fresh, there is also amazing art on the walls."}
{"text":"Just had a terrible experience here!!! Server served soup with 3 fingers submerged in my soup.....He was oblivious to it.  We could not eat our $54.00 lunch.  I went to counter complained to the same server that I was completely grossed out and asked for soup money back... He gave me $3.00 back and said, \"roger that\".
Subsequently called asked to speak to owner and left message.  Disgusting!!"}
{"text":"How is it this place takes what is standard fare elsewhere and turns it into absolutely mouth watering deliciousness? Case in point quesadilla chock full of veggies, chick peas and a vegan \"cheese\" sauce that is to die for. I don't even like quesadillas...but loved it. Hats off to 24 carrots for high quality delicious and healthy food!!"}
{"text":"Best juice bar in Chandler.  The ingredients are very fresh, and smoothies are filling.  The menu has a lot of interesting drinks, and new ones are always being added.  The owner is very knowledgeable about what she's selling you, and the seating area is very inviting.  Try the carrot juice, it's amazing."}
{"text":"The food was decent, but waiting 27 minutes for a bowl of soup, muffin and one smoothie doesn't mean the food is spectacular, it just means this place is run poorly."}
{"text":"24 C is the ultimate restaurant. Everything on their menu is delish. And for what you get considering that is organic the price is really reasonable.  I've had multiple great satisfying meals here and keep comimg back for more. This place is a true  culinary inspiration."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegan nor a vegetarian, yet I love this place!! So far I've had a green smoothie and three brunch items - Arizona bowl, breakfast burrito, and carrot pancakes - and they are all so delicious! The carrot pancakes are especially delectable. They are so flavorful it's unreal, they almost taste like a cinnamon bun. It is a little pricier than I would typically like to pay (though not outrageous by any means) but it is worth the price; everything I've gotten has great flavor and is a pretty good portion, not to mention the ingredients they use are all local and natural/unprocessed. The place is adorable and pretty quiet and I enjoy going there by myself sometimes just to read.

The only cons I have are the price (but again, what I've had has been worth what I've paid) and every time I go I have to wait about 15 minutes for my food, no matter what I order or whether there are other customers in there or not. 

Overall, great place! I have come back a few times and I will continue to!"}
{"text":"This is new in Tempe and I am glad it is right around the corner! I love that the food is fresh and they try and use the best ingredients possible. The atmosphere is great, I love the decor and how they serve you water in your own individual glass bottle for the table. They have a little seating area with couches and board games that would seem to be fun to hang out at night or on a weekend afternoon. With the hours I work it is hard to get there when they are open so I hope with the more business they get, the longer they will stay open!"}
{"text":"I had expected from a place that specialized in them. We ordered brunch items, and they were good, but quite over priced in my opinion. We spent $75 for breakfast for my little family of four. I would say our meal was worth about half that. It took over 45 minutes for our food to be served after we ordered. The server wasn't very friendly our helpful. Overall, we were excited to try this place, but in the end we were quite disappointed and we won't be visiting again."}
{"text":"Went back again yesterday and had their mango limeade special - it was perfectly cold, tangy, and sweet on a hot summer day. It's easy to see why 24C is doing well. The people like working there and it shows in the atmosphere and quality of their food & drinks! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Maybe it's because I recently have become vegan, but damn, this place is poppin! I take my family there when they wanna eat out with me, but I would rather not be constricted to just one item on the menu. My little sister who is 12 (and almost vomits at the site of vegetables) even loves this place. All around great environment, great staff. I have never been disappointed. Sasha I hope you never need to leave. I love this place and will recommend as a first choice to just about anyone. Vegan or not!"}
{"text":"Andrew Weil better watch out. 24 Carrots' food is the epitome of what raw/vegan food should be. The care and love Sasha infuses into her food is evident in the unmatchable flavors. She so obviously cares not only about her menu, but about her patrons and their health. I will be visiting again soon and often!"}
{"text":"This place was the most terrible food place I have been to in the last 5 years. Overpriced, small portions, bland mediocre at best food, terrible service, long wait times during non-rush hours. The best thing they have going for them is the cafe is cute on the inside.

The service was absolutely horrible, we were in line (mind you not a very long one) for at least 20 mins. We waited at least another 20 mins for any of our drinks to come out, 3 smoothies and two plain coffees. Then my wrap arrived and it was another 15 mins before our friends' food came out (they ordered before me), a wrap and a basic sandwich. 

I love wraps, rice and grilled veggies, but my wrap was not good, the best part was the few bites with avocado in it (paid an extra $1 for maybe 1/4 or 1/2 of an avocado in it). The chips with salsa was decent, but came with a tiny amount of salsa.

Even the vegan in our group didn't really like her meal but was more okay with her boyfriend's sandwich. No one really liked their meal. 

The smoothies were just ok. Mine (triple acai threat) had a good flavor but was super thin (more like juice). The dreamsicle flavor had a weird aftertaste and the peanut butter/chocolate had no chocolate flavor in it to be found.

All and all a real dud, we will never be back."}
{"text":"I love this place  I go to it every time I'm in Chandler.  Fresh food, friendly people and a gem of a find in a strip mall."}
{"text":"This place is awesome if you're on a health kick. The food is unusual, can't say I've ever heard of a butternut burger before. But for someone on a Paleo diet, it's great to have options! My favorite is the avocado smoothie, which is creamy and sweet but has no added sugars or dairy. They have a lot of GF options as well."}
{"text":"This was probably the best vegan breakfast I've ever had, or at the very least it is tied with some of the \"famous\" vegan places I've been to in Portland and Seattle.

First of all, it's obvious that 24 Carrots started off as a juice bar. They use all local produce when they can and have thought up some delicious combinations. I had something off the menu that the owner recommended. I believe the main ingredients were kale, cucumber, and pineapple, and it was very very good. I also noticed on the menu that there are some very unique add-ins for juices and smoothies such as herbs like fenugreek and turmeric.

The chocolate coconut french toast was divine. It was cooked to perfection and topped with just the right amount of coconut cream, dried coconut, chocolate chips, and strawberries so that it was decadent but not overly done. Even the strawberries and oranges that garnished the plate were juicy and organic. 

As a vegan I typically don't eat imitation meat - it weirds me out a little bit. But after learning that their \"bacon\" is made from tofu that they make in-house, season, bake, and then grill to order, I just had to try it. I was never a huge fan of bacon pre-veg anyway, so I didn't really have any expectations. It had a great flavor and was actually quite good. If imitation meat was my thing, I would be all about this stuff. The owner did say it is a huge seller for them.

If I lived in Phoenix I would be a regular at this place so that I could try everything on the menu. Everything sounded so good! The owner was also very sweet and I chatted with her quite a bit. I'm so glad I went, and it was definitely worth every penny."}
{"text":"I believe this is their new location. I ordered the triple threat açaí smoothie and it was refreshing and full of flavor. Unlike a lot of smoothies I've tried, with each sip I was able to identify all of the different fruits in this drink. $14 for two medium smoothies, a bit pricey for drinks but I made sure to sign up for the free rewards program. They texted me a voucher for a free iced tea for my next visit which is a plus! Will be coming back to try their food next."}
{"text":"When you first walk in, you see nothing but the two juice menu blackboards (smoothies on one tablet, fruit and veggie juices on the next) on the wall. The owner told me they do EVERYTHING out of a freaking microwave and toaster oven, since the place merely started out as a juice bar. 

While I knew I wanted to try a veggie juice, it was kind of hard to choose. Mainly because it still had a large amount of fruit, I chose the Voodoo Child juice. Its contents included: apple, carrot, grape, cucumber, celery, beet, lime and Dragon Sauce. Honestly, I had no idea what Dragon Sauce was, but ordered the juice anyways. Well, Dragon Sauce is actually a very spicy hot sauce ha. At least the cashier let me know about it before they put it in my drink. 

Initially I wasn't sure what to think. It was warm and I'm used to cold juices, so that took a few sips to get into the groove. However, the more I drank, the more I enjoyed my fruit and veggie juice! It was refreshing and light and tart all at the same time. Something I will definitely come back for! While a little on the expensive side, I felt good about splurging on something healthy while also supporting a local eco-friendly business. And I will come back; there are so many juices I am curious to try!"}
{"text":"We are vegans, so we have visited most vegan places while on our trip in Phoenix.  We came here while on vacation for breakfast and it was the best meal we've had our whole trip.  I only wish we would've came sooner on our trip, so that we could return for lunch!"}
{"text":"Beyond 5 stars. Such a fun, fresh place for Vegan and Vegetarian options. Reallllly good food!!!"}
{"text":"I used to go to 24 Carrots at the old location. I'm not vegetarian or vegan but this is a great healthy place to grab a bite to eat. They have a great selection of juices, smoothies, and coffee drinks as well as pastries! They've definitely grown over the years! The food itself is usually very good but sometimes it can be hit or miss with the unique recipes. One thing that seems to always be consistent is the amazing people who work here. They are very helpful and polite and always offer great customer service. May not be my go to every night but it is definitely on my list of regular visits!"}
{"text":"Finally made it in. This spot just wasn't for me. The openness, lighting, and color options made me feel as if I were in a hospital cafeteria. The staff was appallingly monotone and straight faced as if their lives couldn't get any worse. Behind upset employees - there's usually a subpar leader. My smoothie was straight up an over priced cup of fruit purée at room temperature. I don't plan on returning. Ever."}
{"text":"We went here based on the rave reviews of a co worker. The original location seems to have been in Chandler on Chandler Blvd, but that placed closed so we had to come here.

I ended up getting the nachos, my co workers got the quesadilla and one of then got a protein soup. When the soup came out it was deep purple! However my friend reported that it tasted fine... my nachos were decent but tasted more like Indian chaat than nachos (fine by me). 

They have a large selection of smoothies and their menu changes frequently. I'll be back if I'm in Tempe again."}
{"text":"I LOVE the BLT that's what I get every time I go,( I have sampled a lot of the other things they offer and its all good but BLT is my favorite!! its a very long drive from where I live but worth every second, the gf carrot cake is awesome as well...my only complaint is I wish they could be open longer in the evenings or open longer on Sundays and serve the BLT'S on Sunday my whole family would go if it were."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by a friend because I wanted to stop eating out during my lunch hour at food places that weren't so good. I figured with itthis place being healthy and vegan, it would be the new place for me. WRONG!

My co worker and I got there before the lunch rush and ordered. We waited 30 minutes for our food as shortly after we placed our order, the lunch rush came. The workers are young and look very lost as they're walking around. They moved very slowly with no energy. I wouldn't put it past them if it turns out they were all stoned. Customer service is not a priority for them. Even the food wasn't that good and overpriced for the quality. I won't be back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here last night to celebrate his birthday and it was our first time coming to this restaurant. Not only was it completely vegan-friendly (my boyfriend is a vegan), it had a cute atmosphere, the food was EXCELLENT, and the service was even better. We will keep coming back here as often as we can! Very highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"This is the second time now that I have tried coming here for lunch that they're not open when their website says they are,  and since I only have a 30min break I miss my lunch. Either be open when you say you are or update your hours!."}
{"text":"Our first time here, our first time trying vegan  food. What a great place!!! Cashier/waiter was super helpful in recommending what items to try. Carrot soup was so flavorful and rich, my tastebuds were happy. We had nachos and quesadilla to share. Both were so tasty! Definitely a fan of the nachos! Quinoa bowl and Dan Dan noodle bowls were a table favorite. We will definitely be back!
Thank you Check Please Arizona for the recommendation!"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast spot for vegans.  The vegan eggs & bacon taste just like the real thing.  You'll pay a bit more than your average diner, but aren't you worth it?  Amazing pancakes and stick-to-your-guts oatmeal."}
{"text":"My husband and I love the food here! It's always fresh and great tasting. The buffalo cauliflower wrap and the quesadillas are my favorite.

The only thing that kind of sucks about this place is their service... It's hit or miss. I literally have ordered a juice from here and by the time I got it, I was finished with my food... What the heck? Not cool. 

BUT, I'm giving this place 5 stars because the food is bomb. I hope the owner reads this and lights some fires under the employees' butts to hustle."}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere here; the mad hatter style seating, the cozy library, and the local artist's paintings all made this restaurant aesthetically appealing. I had the \"My Favorite French Toast\", gluten free-afied, and it was delicious. The roasted oats gave it a nice texture while the berries, cinnamon banana, and coconut cream added a sweetness that I could enjoy with out feeling guilty. This place left me smiling! I will be returning and recommend that others give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Vegan  heaven 

Had tacos of the day and iced tea

Met my cousin who I had not seen in 6 years and spent over 3 hours there and never once did anyone try to give us the boot 

Nice people"}
{"text":"I'm traveling and stayed a few days in Tempe. Once I discovered 24 Carrots I went back several times. The first time I got the El Vampiro juice - it was pretty much perfect! A little sweet and tangy with the shocking red of beets. Then I tried the quesadilla which was ok, liked the filling of black beans and kale but I've never been a fan rice wraps - too dry. And I think the guy at the counter was standing in for someone because he got my order wrong in two ways and it took a while. I went back for the wifi the next day and had the tres leches cupcake - this thing is divine!! Perfect texture and taste, not sickeningly sweet but decadent in all the right ways! I ordered the dandan noodles and that was amazing: crunchy veggies fresh spinach, delicious sauce with a touch of heat - I didn't need sriracha. Noodles get tough if you wait and eat it later so eat it fresh! The next day I got the mango cayenne cupcake - terribly hard cake and no spiciness but the mango cream/frosting was ok. I ate the black rice bowl for lunch and liked the flavors - had to add salt even though I usually don't eat a lot of salt - in this case it had zero salt and some added salt enhanced the flavors. I got the burger and carrot cake for dinner. The chickpea patty is nothing to write home about but the bread was very hearty and good. The side salad is yummy too and colorful, the balsamic vinaigrette is solid. The carrot cake was perfectly succulent but too much cream cheese frosting - wayyy too much! Could have gone without any of that. I give this place five stars because of so many vegan options that are gluten free as well, including deserts! Love it! And wifi!!!! Service can be slow and about half the people are friendly, the rest seem unhappy."}
{"text":"Loooove having a delicious juice bar and vegan restaurant so close to my place! I'll definitely be back :) my only complaint is that they're closed on Mondays."}
{"text":"We visited here on two separate occasions on a recent trip to Tempe as it's very convenient to where were were staying.  The food is delicious and fresh.  I ordered an imitation crab sandwich the first day and breakfast burrito the next visit.  I've been craving that burrito ever since!  One star removed because the service was very slow.  Make sure you're not in a hurry if you come here."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time and it is delish. I got the sweet potato quesadilla and it's super yummy. Def will be back again to try more things."}
{"text":"Awesome! Had the Voodoo Child fresh juice and the buffalo cauliflower wrap... very very tasty! Little expensive but isn't all good food? I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"It's been a couple of years, but I remember the original location and my first time ordering raw tacos and poppers. It was the best thing I ever had. After being stationed in CA and Southern AZ, I made it back to the east valley and stopped in for an iced mocha. It was like none other. Choocolate made from scratch...it had to be real raw cacao powder, it was the best mocha I've ever had. Awesome to be able to have the cleanest and tastiest version in my area!"}
{"text":"I was simply looking for new eats in my neighborhood, and unexpectedly and luckily stumbled upon my new fav caffe. Plenty of healthy offerings here. Can't wait to go back to try their juices and desserts."}
{"text":"Little did I know he lady grilling was the owner. Great food!  You won't be disappointed with anything with I'm reason!"}
{"text":"Great juices and lunches! I'm not in the area often but would go out of my way just to come back!"}
{"text":"I have been slowly transitioning to a plant based diet and was excited to see this place wasn't too far from where we live. Their food was phenomenal! I got the southwest wrap with a side salad and my husband got the hangry tacos. We both left very full and satisfied. 

My husband (who loves meat) said \"I never thought I would get full from a vegan meal.\" Win!

We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for something healthy, vegetarian, vegan, or even raw this is the place to go! it has something to satisfy everyones needs and flavour to boot! if you are a big meat eater, this is the place to try. Seriously. It will change your mind about eating vegetarian or raw. All the meals are bursting with flavour, and the portion size is good. The price of this place is also on-par with what you get. If you are looking for fresh, farmers market quality stuff, 24 carrots is the place to go! I drive 30 minutes just to eat lunch here. Wish more of these places would pop up! Atmosphere is very inviting. It's very Portland/Coffee shop feel with a nice lounge area and books to read while eating. They also have some kids toys for the little ones which is a nice touch!  I have eaten at a few veg friendly places in the valley and 24 Carrots is the best!

Oh- and I see they have new hours. They'll be open for dinner now which is great! Next thing I'm hoping for is delivery! :)"}
{"text":"I am a big fan....For 2012 I am going to really try to eat healthier so I will be in here more often. The food is always tasty and unique. I love the happy hour because drinks are half priced."}
{"text":"Was pretty good. I just think they need to consider changing the music. And maybe the front cashier lady be a bit more...engaging. And get rid of the flies...and the dead cockroach..."}
{"text":"Happy to have found this place during our recent trip to Phoenix. My husband and I stopped here several times during our trip. Everything we tried was wonderful. The Arizona bowl and gluten free carrot cake pancakes were our favorites.  We wish we had a restaurant like this at home in Houston."}
{"text":"I finally found this place again after they moved!  It's a bit hard to find actually.  I had driven by it for weeks until I made the effort to figure out where it was.  They only have a banner in the window and the door is hidden behind an alcove on the end of the shopping center so it makes it pretty hard to see driving by.  They are in the Trader joe's shopping center on the opposite end.  Hopefully they are getting a new sign so that people can find them.  I will have to say they are 100% better in the new location.  The staff is super friendly and helpful, there is plenty of room and the food service time has been really fast the four or five times I have been. They keep the web site updated with their menu since it rotates from week to week which is always nice to be able to check before heading over.  Keep up the good work.

Try:

- Raw \"PASTA\" Marinara"}
{"text":"Wow, phenomenal food, fresh, healthy and delicious.  Nachos are amazing, the collard green wrap is delicious, . And the carrot ginger soup made right there in front of you is so tasty!  A definite favorite!"}
{"text":"5-star food, 1-star speed. plan to wait for a long time, but it's totally worth it. the food is fresh, healthy and delicious. gluten-free carrot cake pancakes were bomb, but the owner literally had to mill the gf flour. worth it dot com, but it takes awhile. just sayin."}
{"text":"Like the new location!  It took us a while to come back after they moved!  

We've been here twice in 2 weeks and have been very pleased!  

Pros: 
Much bigger menu - lots to choose from, from more \"junky\" vegan to raw vegan.
Tons of smoothies and juices
Good coffees and teas
We've had 6 different menu items - and we've been happy with them all.

Cons:
Lots of chalkboard menus with squished writing - bring your glasses!
Extremely laid back atmosphere, we're cool with it, but strange for people who aren't.

Note:  Food does take a bit to come out - we actually like this - that means they are cutting up everything fresh to get to you!"}
{"text":"Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!  Everything I have ordered here has been great!  Plus I I LOVE the juices and smoothies.  Sometimes, I have had to wait 15-20 minutes for a juice or smoothie, but it's because they were busy.  I've tried so many delicious things here.  Love it!"}
{"text":"Tasty sandwich.  Thanks for gluten free options. Love the fresh and local fruits and veggies."}
{"text":"Love love love it. Wish they had one near me. Nachos were amazing. Hummus delicious. Fresh ingredients. Great juices."}
{"text":"This used to be a 5 star from me as the food is usually very good and completely vegan with gluten free options that are cooked to order, not the typical gluten free default breads and tortillas that other places use.  

The reason for this review though, is that the place has really been off their game lately.  This is so sad because I want to love them and I keep giving chances almost weekly! All summer I have been going there, but more than 75% of the time they are closed during hours that their website and yelp state should be opened.  This is beyond frustrating as they are across town for me and also I have tried to bring a few different friends from out of town only to get there and have to find another place.  

usually when I get to eat there, the food is phenomenal; however, I have noticed portions getting smaller and smaller and when the owner is not there they always \"run out\" of gluten free bread (which is made to order so read: don't feel like mainf it).  Finally, I went yet again today to order my favorite thing, the \"BLT gluten free\", which I have ordered for four years now, and it was literally about a quarter of the size that it used to be.  I could have eaten it in 3 bites and it was $12.50!! I never usually complain but I did ask if I could either get more or be charged for a half order, since that is what I got.  They were nice and gave me another micro mini sandwich but they both were completely undressed and very different from the usual deliciousness.  They were mediocre at best.  I'm really disappointed and after 4 months of really unfortunate disappointments, not sure I want to keep giving chances to this place... Ugh there goes one of the few vegan options I have... Really hope they get it together Bc I miss 24 carrots!"}
{"text":"It doesn't get much more vegan-hippie than this, but I dig it. I understand this is typically the demographic that healthy/vegan food cultivates. Initially I did not have much interest in checking this place out because of its overly-hippiness, but I went as per recommendation of my brother and do not regret it! My husband and I both had the vegan breakfast burrito and I got mine with a side of chips&salsa, and he got his with a side of fruit. Be prepared, although the burrito is a good portion size, the 'sides' are miniature. I believe his came with 5 pieces of fruit, and mine was 5 chips with a dollop of salsa. But, I would recommend going with the chips&salsa so you can use the salsa on the burrito. It took a while for our food to come out, but we did go at a peak hour. Also, their juice maker is in the front of the store and is extremely loud...so it was a little annoying to be trying to have a conversation only to be interrupted every 4 minutes by a jet engine. Regardless, I am still giving them 4 stars because I know I'll be back to try their nachos (we saw the table next to us give them and they look huge and delish!) and I like what they stand for. I'll always be an advocate for places that promote healthy and ethical eats!"}
{"text":"Today I ordered a delicious Carnival Enchilada at 24 Carrot.  I was so impressed because vegan Mexican food dishes are not easy to come by and difficult to pull of.  Instead of a red tomato sauce, they used beets to accompany a delicious homemade cashew cheese sauce!!!  It had that authentic Mexican food taste but it was super crisp, clean and refreshing in a raw foods way. The staff could not have been more kind hearted and compassionate as well.  What a beautiful experience!"}
{"text":"I love that they are trying to use local produce, but it shouldn't take 30 min to make a smoothie. I'm not being hyperbolic... 30 minutes to make my smoothie. No they weren't very busy at all. Maybe one person ordered before me. This is the slowest service in the world. Only come if you have plenty of time to kill."}
{"text":"Really love this restaurant. All vegan and really colorful food. It's a cafe style order at the counter restaurant. Have been here for brunch, lunch and dinner. So far I've tried the harvest quesadilla, bountiful burger, pancakes, carrot cake, pumpkin chocolate chip cookie, pumpkin pie smoothie, and Pb&j smoothie. It's crazy their smoothies are no sugar added but they taste like milkshakes! So delicious and good for you. The staff is super nice and helpful when you ask about menu items. They have actually tried most of the menu because they sincerely love the food so much themselves. I've always loved everything I've had here and have a good experience. I keep coming back for more. Whether you're looking for vegan eats or not this is a good place to check out."}
{"text":"Healthy and delicious food plated beautifully. Good service. My favorite is their southwestern quesadilla, but their soups and their smoothies are also wonderful."}
{"text":"Good food -- delicious, actually. Slooooow service -- I was the only customer and it still took 20 minutes to bring my order. I'm guessing there's an attitude issue in the kitchen. Or maybe it starts at the top, because their website doesn't offer any option for sending in feedback. If it had, I'd have sent this directly to the management instead of posting it here."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times and I have to say I love their juice bar options.  Sasha is awesome in that she knows the particular things that particular people like.. ie, she has an array of smoothie add-ins (wheatgrass, veggie protein, etc).  I would say the only complaint is that both times I've ordered to-go here, it's taken forever (even for a smoothie).. so I've resorted to just calling way ahead.

Her sandwiches are big and are wholesome and have interesting mixes and only once have I had an issue (I had expired carrots), but that was just once and the other times I've had no issue.  I've seen her with farmer's market bags of produce, so I know she gets her produce as local as possible.

The decor is very relaxing and invites you to hang out a bit longer.  A few times she's been in the kitchen running her mixer and pops out with some dessert topping or filling she's making that she'd like us to try and tell her what we think of them - they've always been good.. especially because she has to be creative to make them vegan and tasty.

Her to-go containers are all compostable and she is very cautious about re-use in her dining utensils (ie. no styrofoam or plastic cutlery).

I support this establishment because they are commited to whole food, customer satisfaction, and the environment... and she makes Hella good desserts, smoothies, and big yummy sandwiches."}
{"text":"Cool, relaxed vibe with a great staff . I had the BLT it was delicious."}
{"text":"This place looks like a vegetarian cafe.  If you've been to a veg cafe, you know what I'm talking about.  It's a super chill place, with plenty of comfortable low-key seating, and a menu chock full of juices, smoothies, salads and deliciousness.  There's a refrigerated unit with some fresh veggies for sale.  There's also a display case with gluten free and soy free desserts.

As you order some food, you'll probably want to order more, because the menus are delicious.  If you like juice, then you're set.  If you like smoothies, you're set.  If you like vegan desserts, you're set.  Their entrees include wraps, tacos (!), sandwiches, salads and raw delights.  So delicious.  I was impressed with the number of raw food choices they had.

I'm bummed that I didn't get to have the breakfast - gluten free carrot pancakes and french toast.  A dream come true for those who eschew gluten!  The entrees here are delicious.  Just watching what people were eating was so exciting.

My favorite raw sushi nori rolls ever were here - I was impressed by the delicious selection of ingredients tossed together into these tasty treats.  I would order them every time I went there, hands down.  So delicious and fresh and flavorful and not overly salty (usual downfall of raw vegan sushi rolls).  The veggies are so fresh, I was so happy.  The zucchini noodles were also so fresh and deliciously sliced to a thinness that gave zucchini noodles a new definition.  Delightful.  So exciting for my tastebuds, because I love zucchini noodles, but I never realized how they could be done so perfectly.  Give me more!

All in all, this place is a veg paradise, and if it were open Sunday night, I would've gone back in a heartbeat.  Fresh, tasty and healthy - what more does one want in an eatery?"}
{"text":"Great place to eat real food Sometimes service takes a little bit but it is worth the wait. If you are a lover of peanut butter, please ask for a PB& B that is one of my favorites. Also there are some tacos and enchiladas, they taste really good. It is 10 42am and I am drooling. Maybe it is time for breakfast. Anyway, they have fresh ingredients and their deserts are good too. Give it a shot whatever your diet is. Enjoy and I am looking forward they keep up with the same taste."}
{"text":"Thanks to the foodies on Yelp, I was able to at least find the correct corner of 24 Carrots new location!   The house vegan blt was tasty.  The bread was toasted just right and the beet soup was vibrant in flavor!  I would order this again!"}
{"text":"Ehhh .....a little bit too healthy for me. Okay - I admit, I just finished 90 minutes of hot yoga and just sweated buckets of water weight. So I thought why not try something healthy. Decided to try 24 Carrots and picked out their Smokey BLT Club and the Pesto Pasta. For you meat eaters I don't think this is the place for you but doesn't hurt to try. ;)
Smokey BLT Club - you're thinking bacon, right? Wrong! It's their \"house vegan bacon\" which pretty much is warm firm tofu with some sauce on it, along with avocado, tomato, red onions, greens and aioli sauce covered by a multi grain sandwich bread. Also came with a side of hummus and carrots. If the \"bacon\" wasn't warm then the sandwich wouldn't have been as decent. Content. 

Pesto Pasta Primavera -- uh didn't realize that I think I ordered something completely different. Their pesto pasta says it has \"Asparagus, carrot, red peppers, cabbage, kale, but free basil pesto, drizzle cashew cream\" I ate whatever was on the plate bc I was so hungry. I'm looking back on the menu and confirmed I was given the Zucchini Noodles. Wow!! Totally missed that one. Didn't get asparagus. Didn't get red peppers. Didn't get carrots. What??!! Haha - mental note: should have realized there were missing ingredients. Ate it anyway since it was considered healthy. 

Overall content but got hungry later. Lesson: look at the plate for missing veggies!"}
{"text":"SO GOOD! I was so excited to find out there is a good all-vegan restaurant here in Tempe! As a new vegan, I'm still learning about all the great types of food there are, and 24 Carrots is a great place to try new things. I took some friends for breakfast and we got the breakfast burrito, Arizona Bowl with cauliflower, and the french toast. Everything was flavorful, fresh, balanced, and DELICIOUS!  I am a total caffeine addict, so I also got a soy latte with date caramel- Holy deliciousness! Really rich and decadent. They also do fresh juices and smoothies.

The cashier was really helpful and knowledgeable when I asked him about some of the dishes and their ingredients, and the staff checked in often to make sure we were enjoying our meal.

The limoncello cookie sandwich was amazing as well, we all split it for dessert. A great, casual place to bring friends and have an amazing healthy meal. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I am so grateful to have found this amazing restaurant with yummy raw food options. I had the tacos...they were so delicious!!!! And the owner was so sweet to make me a decedent raw chocolate mouse for my birthday!"}
{"text":"Very few times Yelp has let us down when selecting a new restaurant to try but unfortunately this was one of them.  I do not know how this place can have 4 stars!  I am beginning to think these reviews are by people that do not know what good food is supposed to taste like.

First of all, both Yelp and their website states that they open at 8am. They open at 10am.  We live in Tucson so we were excited to try this place out on our way to Scottsdale. Not cool that they weren't open at 8am like stated. 

My husband ordered the Vegan Breakfast Burrito and I ordered the My Favorite French Toast. We also ask if the jalapeno poppers are indeed jalapenos (not sure why my husband asked this question but I guess he had a feeling) and we were assured that they used jalapenos.  We also ordered a side of the apple Soyrizo hash.

Our food arrives and I wish I had taken a picture of my plate.  The description of my French toast reads: Creamy Coconut Custard| Berry Coulis| Cinnamon Sugar Bananas | House Granola Seasonal Fruit Side.  Yah right!  There was no sign of creamy coconut custard only two slices of barely buttered bread with a smear of berry and an entire whole banana with no cinnamon sugar laid across the dry bread.  It had no flavor, the whole banana was weird (should have been at least sliced) and was just not good.

The apple Soyrizo hash was soggy apples, soggy sweet potatoes and soggy white potatoes with no Soyrizo whatsoever.  This \"hash\" had zero flavor and after two bites, I couldn't force myself to take another bite.  

My husband's burrito while looked like it should taste good was not.  He said he didn't know how they could have all these ingredients and not have any flavor.  He ate half of it because he was hungry but the rest of the day his stomach hurt.

The \"jalapeno\" poppers arrive and it is some sort of mixture on top of quartered red bell peppers! Now I am very allergic to bell peppers so we tell the server that we do not want this dish and since she had taken our order my husband reminded her that he had asked if they were in fact jalapenos.  She said \"Oh yeah! I'm sorry. I can refund your money\" and we took her up on that offer."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. I ordered a carry-out but the dining was very appealing. Had I not been in a hurry I would have stayed. The Masala Chai (hot) Tea was really yummy. Even for a 100° day.  Ordered the zucchini noodle salad but received a zucchini salad. It was still good, just not what I ordered. I tried the gluten free lemon and cookies and cream cupcakes. (I believe both kind were gluten free) For a dollar you can't beat it. They are soooo great with tea... Just dangerous Bc you can eat a million of them. I also couldn't help myself and ordere the gluten free carrot cake. OMGGGG it's so damn good! Everything was so good I don't even care my order was wrong... I mean I do care but you get it. (Posted a few days after visit)"}
{"text":"Very good unusual combinations of ingredients but the food is amazing and the staff is very helpful. I will defiantly be back for their special pho night"}
{"text":"I love the ambience in here and let me tell you, the juice is amazing. I've tried a couple of different ones: Carrots over easy and the Blueberry Pom Bom, both are AMAZING. I've been looking for a juicing place all over Tempe and this one is so great. The staff is always nice and friendly and all of their food comes from local sources. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone because they have something for everyone!"}
{"text":"I got the burger and it was not as hardy as I thought it would be. It basically tasted like a lentil patty. On the side there was a small salad, for dessert I got the lavender chocolate cake which was decent but the slices were very small. Nothing really special on the menu and it is overpriced."}
{"text":"Go if you haven't tried it yet. Everything is delicious at this place. Super sweet employees. I love their desserts. Try the carrot cake."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food, the dish I had was good, but maybe a bit more salt/seasoning could of been added. The soup was super yummy, and it came out quick. Prices and portions are decent as well, I'm not accustomed to being full at a vegan joint, at least not for this cheap.   I'm excited to come back and try some other dishes."}
{"text":"Food is not organic. Workers lied about the food, they said they used organic house vegan milk but they didn't. They used conventional processed milks. We had stomach aches from their tea. Their raw food are not 100 percent organic which causes more problems in human health. Increased pesticide use in the conventional produce will make us sick. So this place sucks."}
{"text":"Good place for hanging out at nighttime to enjoying a goodnight with friends and loved their foods and drinks! I was hanging out a few times with a few friends that I enjoyed a lot and have a very good time! I planned coming back here in the near future! I highly recommended!"}
{"text":"After seeing the owners story online we decided to check this place out. Needless to say, we will never go back. The restaurant was completely empty with two staff members chatting behind the counter. We didn't get a hi, hello, welcome not even a waive. Even with that poor customer service will still decided to sit ourselves and look over the menu, after about five minutes with anyone coming over to check on us we politely put our menus away and walked out. Smh, where's the customer service, my biggest pet peeve.  24 Carrots! You've made the list, owner check your staff. That was horrible !!! ZERO CUSTOMER SERVICE !!!"}
{"text":"This place is so cute! good vibes and amazing food! I also took home a piece of carrot cake, it was to die for!! So decadent and tasty"}
{"text":"Wow, where to start where to start.  after completing culinary school I realize the challenge in cooking vegan, its very easy to over season or under season items.  The owner seems to have vegan cooking down pat.  I have stopped by twice in the past week spending way more than I planned on spending simply because I was tempted into testing out the flavors offered.  As an example...... Her bacon..... She first makes Tofu from scratch, then cuts thin slices, bakes those slices, then finishes on a grill with some seasoning, it doesn't necessarily taste like bacon, but the taste is intense and delicious.  The juice bar is also very extensive (some items are not even on the menu like my favorite... the Grinia Colada....) The Grinia Colada has got a handful of greens juiced alongside a few fruits coconut milk and lime.  Mindblowing!  If you are looking for a spot to fill up without the guilty, \"I should run a 5k after this meal,\" feeling, stop by 24 carrots."}
{"text":"EX-SQUEEZE ME, how is it that I didn't know sooner that this lovely cafe exsisted?? I had not seen it before on my many trips around the corner to Changing Hands Bookstore. It's tucked away like a secret, but this one is meant to be shared. A hidden hole in the wall of flavor and serenity this will quickly become my go to place! 24 Carrots is filled with vegan options for breakfast or lunch, gluten free goodies, coffee, tea, fabulous concoctions of fruit & vegtable juice and smoothies, friendly service, books and even a cozy corner to curl up and read in. They offer an irresistable shelf of books where you can take one home free with the promise if you take one you leave one. I enjoyed the Blue Pom Bomb a sweet mixture of blueberry, pomegranate, strawberry and apple juice and the potato leek soup,that came with a kick of spice, loved it! I'll definitely be back, not just because I owe them a book but there are so many delecatable delights to be had. That pumpkin smoothie is whispering my name.... I can't wait to return to this sweet escape of a cafe..."}
{"text":"I've been coming to 24 Carrots (old and new location) for over a year.  The food is consistently fantastic!   Always fresh and seasoned amazingly!  You might expect vegan food to be bland, but it's not when done right.  It is amazing the flavors they get out of things.  The creams you eat would make you swear they are cream from a cow..

Today I had their tacos with a side salad and carrot soup.  The shells and contents were very, very good.  (see my picture I posted).   I ALWAYS order the carrot soup when I'm here too.  This is my favorite item on the menu.

You also can never go wrong with the quesadillas.  They've been good with every variety they have offered.

Ok, the parts people might complain about:  

1. The wait.  Yes, it takes a fairly long time to make fresh vegan food.  Usually I get my food within 10 mins though.  Once during a very busy time it did take 30 mins.  That is pushing people's patience for sure, but this isn't McDonalds.  If you don't want to wait, you can order ahead and pick it up when you arrive.  This works great for quick lunches.

2. The prices.  Yes, it's not cheap.  Again, fresh, organic food is expensive and takes a lot of labor to prepare.  I think the prices are reasonable for what you get.

3. The hip kids working there.  There are some kids working there that have kind of a hippy vibe or tattoo obsessions or are pierce-aholics.  This kind of goes with the territory though of these types of places.  As long as they are clean and handle my food properly, I'm fine with it!  If you judge people on looks, you might be taken aback though.

Overall, great place that i love to eat at."}
{"text":"I always forget to take pictures! Have been here several times and always enjoy it! Most recent visit was 6/29/17. Some dishes we've tried: Dan Dan Noodles, jewel kale salad, Buddha bowl and garden burger (daily special varies) the bowls (Dan Dan & Buddha) are really the stars of the show here. I'd recommend starting there. Salads are good. Burgers, honestly I'd pass on them. Desserts, smoothies and teas are all great! Husband especially likes the PB & B. I like how big the Iced tea selection is. Last visit I had the cookie bar with salted caramel icing. Yum but super rich! We've exhausted the kids menu, but unfortunately my toddler won't touch it. I think that's more about her than the food. I've tried her meals and they're okay. Customer service here is excellent! The space is a good size and they have a play area for kids, which as parents of a young child we love! I haven't been in for breakfast yet, but based on the pictures I need to make that happen. Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"This place provides such a variety of vegan options. I got the Dan Dan Noodles and it was absolutely incredible, I would highly recommend this place to anyone who has a vegan diet or is interested in trying it out."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere of this place and I really hope it thrives long-term. I also think this section of tempe is a great location for the demographic they are catering to. That being said, the three star rating is on here with my willingness to return and hopefully update my review and increase stars.
My experience on the customer service side was overall pretty poor. I arrived, and was a little taken aback by all the options and I had limited time so I went with soup and a hummus/veggie plate. They had two soups listed on the chalkboard but they were out of one. Which is fine.... But its a chalkboard, so just erase the unavailable soup. I even suggested it, but was either ignored or maybe she didn't hear me.

I get my soup and its the one they originally told me they were out of. Luckily I was hungry and they both sounded delicious so I went with it. It was a ginger coconut carrot something or other. Very good!!!! It was sweet and I'm thinking with coconut milk and extra agave added and some apple juice (as she explained was part of the soup base) - might be vegan but probably high calorie and definitely high sugar. Very gingery but also very good. Was just puzzled at the mix up that they never quite admitted to.

Anyway..onto my hummus/veggie platter. I was one of two patrons there. My hummus platter (hummus and veggies) took about fifteen minutes. It was bewildering. I was so hungry and didn't want to continue eating the high sugar soup so I just waited and waited and listened to the several staff folks just banter with each other. I was very frustrated. Even if the hummus is prepared fresh per order..it still took about ten minutes longer than it should have. 
It was good, full of great veggies and portion of hummus was generous which made me happy. 

It was the inexplicable long wait and weird inaccurate communication about the soup that drops this review from four to three stars. However I am excited to come back and hopefully be proven that this was a one-off. Luckily the food seems great so I'm optimistic that customer service concerns are resolved."}
{"text":"24 Carrot is a very bright and enjoyable addition to the area. They specialize in fresh juices and vegan meals and baked goods. This is the second time I've been here in 2 days. The staff has been very pleasant  and the food is very fresh and tastie. I am not vegan nor am I vegetarian for that matter, though I try to maintain a healthy diet and am always looking to cut back on my meat consumption. I recommend the Southwest Wrap and both smoothies I have tried (Tropic Thunder & Berry Beet Up)  have been quite good. Expect to spend around $20 for a meal and smoothie together."}
{"text":"Love the environment in this little place. They have an adorable library section with a leave-one-take-one book section. Their juices are delicious and super fresh too. Definitely a great place to go, relax, be healthy, study, etc!"}
{"text":"I'm going to start off this review by saying that I am not Vegan, Raw, Vegetarian, or anything at all. I guess I could also just say that I eat bacon. Lots of it.

With that being said, I LOVED 24 Carrots. Definitely a place to check out even if you don't always eat Vegan or Vegetarian.

Boyfriend and I started with the chicory Kapi, a green peace smoothie, and cold brew coffee. All awesome. Boyfriend was particularly pleased to have multiple banana-less smoothie options, since he has a banana allergy.

Split a few dishes with friends. Tried the Dan Dan Noodles, Quesadilla, and the Buffalo Cauliflower Wrap. Dan Dan noodles had a ton of flavor and a good amount of spice. Part of the magic for me was the various ways that they prepared fruits and veggies to add flavor to the dishes. The seasoned jackfruit in the quesadilla was amazing, as was the yummy buffalo cauliflower. I would eat any of the three as a stand alone meal.

Ended the meal with the raw chocolate peanut butter raspberry cup and a lavender cupcake. Both were bomb.

All in all, I would go back in a second and definitely plan on it if life brings me back to Phoenix. Thanks for a truly tasty introduction to what Vegan food can be, 24 carrots!"}
{"text":"24 Carrots is a rare commodity in the modern world of restaurants, where most food is factory farmed, highly processed, and prepared using nutrient stripping, unhealthy methods.  

I have been eating their fresh and ever-changing food creations as well as drinking their fresh juices and smoothies for several years, dating back to their original location in Chandler.  

It is really nice to see them expand into this new location in Tempe, where they are growing and getting the exposure they deserve.  They offer healthy, delicious options for raw, vegan, and gluten free eaters.  

Sasha, the owner, took time to sit with me and give me valuable tips and suggestions for choosing to go on a raw cleansing diet.  Very warm, knowledgable, and hospitable.  She even let me try a raw dessert on the house!  

I give this restaurant five stars and would love to see it continue to grow and succeed.  It may be slightly more expensive than your average lunch spot, but the quality is noticable if you know what's good for your health."}
{"text":"My husband, kids and I went here on a Friday night and they seemed to be pretty slow. This was our first trip here and I've been wanting to try it for a while. The decor is very eclectic and bright. When you first enter there is a little seating area with some couches, toys, and a ton of books which my kids were thrilled about. I'm sure these toys get a lot of use and many of the parts were missing but it didn't seem to bother my 3 and 5 year old. They were just happy to go to a restaurant with toys! We were able to order right away and the girl who took our order was very nice. We ordered a BLT and a Philly sandwich with chips and salsa on the side. My kids ordered the macaroni and cheese which came with a salad on the side. The food took about 10 minutes to arrive. The BLT was our favorite! It was satisfying and fresh and would have ordered another if I wasn't so full. The Philly was also good but my husband and I both preferred the BLT. My kids were not huge fans of the macaroni and cheese but my husband and I really liked it. It comes with broccoli and spinach mixed in. I was a little disappointed there were not more chips on the side but the salsa that came with it was fresh and delicious. For the three meals plus a small tip we walked away spending around $45. As good as the food is and as much as we appreciate everything about 24 Carrots we do think it is overpriced. On our way out we grabbed a slice of raspberry pistachio cake which was ok but we wish we would have tried a lemonade Cooke instead. We will return to 24 Carrots for the BLT and friendly atmosphere but will be skipping the cake and be going on a pay day."}
{"text":"Most amazing vegan vegetarian café! Very clean, very tasty, and the service is off the charts perfect!"}
{"text":"24 Carrots was my last vegan stop during a recent trip to Arizona.  I was hoping to try one of their weekly lunch offerings, but arrived too early!  I settled for a couple of their brunch options and they did not disappoint.  I ordered the Carrot Cake Pancakes and Arizona Bowl.  The pancakes were a great - fluffy with chunks of carrot and pumpkin seeds.  I also had a side of tofu bacon with them and it was really flavorful and had a great texture.  The Arizona Bowl was delicious - a mix of tofu, soyrizo, veggies, spinach, and avocado.  I think that my bowl was missing the cheese and beans, but it was still filling and really tasty.  I also tried a piece of almond coconut chocolate cake, which was yummy as well.  I was there the day after Easter (for which they were closed) so the baked goods and desserts case was empty, they were out of maple syrup, and my bowl seemed to lack a few components.  I understand that it was the day after a holiday, but really wish they had a bit more to offer.  I will definitely return the next time I'm in Arizona with the hopes of trying out more of their offerings!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing and the people really care. We came for a cooking demo and it was so informational! Lots of gluten free options!"}
{"text":"I really love this place. The food is fresh, creative and excellent. I love the Smokey TLT with avocado. The tempe 'bacon' is made on premises and is crunchy and delicious. There are also wraps, plates, bakery items and more.

Their juices are interesting combinations of fruit and veggies that are delicious and filling. 

The owner, Sasha, came to our table to greet us and insure all was well. Very nice lady who is dedicated to healthy eating and quality organic ingredients. 

Great place for vegetarians, vegans, raw foodists, gluten intolerants and many others with dietary restrictions or preferences, and it tastes good for \"regular\" folks too. 

The only two downsides are probably unavoidable. Number one, it is rather noisy with the blenders going to make the juices and smoothies, and no soft surfaces on the floors or walls to absorb the sound. The other is the price. This is not a cheap place to go, but you get what you pay for and I believe the value is there.

Best to luck to 24 Carrots in its new location!"}
{"text":"I'm completely obligated to support vegan-friendly businesses so I went to 24 Carrots. 

It was definitely only a 3 star place. The high school kids working behind the counter were super enthusiastic but not very knowledgeable. I mean that I'm glad I do my vegan research.

$10 for a Vegan BLT. 
Vegan Bacon was tasty and house-made not the typical Fakin' Bacon standby. Thank god. 
Bread wasn't toasted, unfortunately, so I could taste how mediocre it was. Other than that, the sandwich was pretty dry and I ended up tossing half of it. 
The side carrots were haphazardly thrown in my to-go container but a welcome and cute addition.

I wish that I could have tried a smoothie but after the expensive sandwich, I couldn't justify it. 

I hate to say it, but I left 24 Carrots craving something more. I'll give it one more chance - I'll order a smoothie next time. It's impossible to not love a peanut butter/banana soy protein shake, right?"}
{"text":"I am absolutely blown away by the high reviews this place has. The service is horrible! They usually only have one person taking orders AND then doing the food prep. You would think that they would hire maybe 2 people?!

I have gone there 4 times thinking it must just be bad timing and I really wanted to give this place the benefit of the doubt,  but this last time was the last for sure. While we sat waiting an hour for our lunch, we noticed on the table next to ours was a cockroach happily dining on a dirty table. When I told the owner she just  laughed it off an blamed Subway next door. Ewww!

The food is \"ok\". Definitely not worth the wait and definitely not worth the bugs.

Check their inspection report on Maricopa.gov"}
{"text":"Surprisingly REALLY good! Had a \"carob maca latte\" drink. It was so delish. Now, I'll be more open to try some actually food next time."}
{"text":"I came from Oklahoma to visit my dance teacher who lives in Phoenix and she took me to this wonderful vegan restaurant. She knows the owner Sadhana and her family. 

The owner is super creative and their menu is always changing so on their website they have a \"weekly menu\". Many of the ingredients that they use are what vegetables are in season and are in plenty at the time. Since it is Fall, there is a plethora of pumpkin dishes!

My dance teacher and I each chose a dish and a juice: 

Food:

*Roasted Quinoa Veggie Bowl* basil- roasted seasonal veggies, organic quinoa, lime tahini dressing, cranberry, sunflower seeds, and organic greens. This dish was SO delicious!! It came in a stainless steel bowl. The dressing was just enough, and the roasted veggies were warm, and so appetizing.

*Zucchini Noodle Salad* This bowl was huge! Two people could eat it. It was so yummy but I could not finish the whole thing. Made with zoodles (zucchini noodles), field greens (I had spinach), seasonal veggies (I had beets and carrots with my zoodles), seed medley (pumpkin seeds and sunflower seeds), lemon tahini dressing. So healthy, crispy, and refreshing!

Juice:

*Carrots over Easy* this juice was sweet, but not too sweet. made with carrot, pineapple, strawberry, and apple. Absolutely delicious.

*Beet It* made with carrot, beet, ginger, cucumber, celery, and apple. You can really taste the ginger in this vibrant red juice. Super great for digestion and not bad tasting either.


I highly recommend this cafe to eat something healthy and hearty. There are a variety of foods from wraps, sandwiches, burgers, quesadillas, taquitos, and SO MUCH MORE! Sadhana and the chefs also prepare delicious baked vegan goods. I spied some pumpkin cookies and some kind of a cream cake in the dessert window! Your stomach will not be disappointed by this gem of a place. Go. NOW."}
{"text":"Saw the owner on Sonoran Living and the food looked so good we had to try it out! Very good!!! We had the tree of life salad the pasta marinara and an orange creamsicle smoothie  everything was fantastic and so flavorful  and quite filling!  Staff was very friendly and informative would love one of these closer to us in queen creek
*its been a week since we ate here and I gave to say I've thought about the Tree of Life salad everyday! Soooo good!!!"}
{"text":"So good we ate here two dinners in a row while in Tempe on business. Vegan, with hearty options that can satisfy non-vegans too. The peanut butter smoothie is great (especially with cacao nibs added, you have to ask for this, not on menu). Fruit smoothies are great too. Black bean burger surprisingly delish. Owner operated. Sasha, I think her name was? She came and greeted us. Very friendly and attentive staff. Not super fast at prep, so avoid if your in a hurry. Great place to relax, talk and eat!"}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the best places I've ever eaten at, and it's one of the healthiest!! I can't say enough good things about this place, and I can't wait to go back again. 

Tip: the GF chocolate coconut whoopie pie is insaaaane. I could eat it for every meal!"}
{"text":"Take 3?  In the middle of a craptastic day, I decided to order my lunch ahead, since I wasn't going to have time eat out. Hoping to get a 4 star  meal from 24 Carrots, I placed my order online, and as directed by the site, I arrived promptly 30 minutes later to pick it up.  I had a to wait a few minutes in line, but once it was my turn, I was disappointed to hear that my lunch wasn't ready.  I was told that there was a big party that came in before me and the kitchen got behind but my order would be ready in 5 minutes.  She offered me a bite size chocolate cupcake with peanut butter frosting, which was fantastic! At that point I thought things were starting to look up.  About 15 minutes later, I am told they had some confusion on my order and needed clarification.   Almost 55 minutes after I placed my order it was ready.  Unfortunately I had a meeting at 1PM, so their delay caused me to have to leave my sandwich to get soggy in Aioli.  When I finally got to eating my lunch, I was disappointed to see that they forgot the cucumber on the sandwich, and the avocado and pomegranate in my salad.  I don't mind spending almost $11 on a  1/2 sandwich and side salad, but don't forget to give me all the ingredients!  All in all, what I received tasted good, and would have probably tasted better if I was able to eat it fresh, not an hour after it was made."}
{"text":"Great vegan selections.  Very tasty and well presented.  Loved the colorful plating.  The smoothies were out of this world.  Can't wait to go back a soon again"}
{"text":"Incredibly impressive customer service. Sasha and crew worked all day on a gluten free carrot cake for my sister in-law.  Sasha worked extra hard even after I arrived and walked the cake out to my car to ensure it was perfect. I had a smoothie while I waited, which was also delicious. Thank you Sasha and crew for your outstanding work!!! :D"}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever been so happy that I forgot to bring my lunch to work! I stopped at 24 Carrots on a whim because I wanted something that was healthy, but wouldn't break the bank. I'm so glad I stopped in. 

The staff was friendly and was able to help me narrow down exactly what would satisfy my craving for curry. I was even being helped by a regular customer that drives 30 miles just to come here! She convinced me that I NEEDED to try their dessert & k caved! I wish that I took a picture of it, but it was a cute mango, coconut & cashew cream parfait that was seriously the best thing I've ever tasted! It was the perfect amount of sweet! & the best part? No sugar added! 

Back to my meal, I ended up choosing their Buddha Bowl. It was EXACTLY what I was wanting. Perfect amount of spice & the curry flavor was just what I was craving. It's also a generous helping. I easily saved the rest for tomorrow's lunch. 

Bottom line, this place is definitely worth a try & I'm so happy I stopped in. This will not be the last"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place several times I went. The staff was pretty friendly, but very relaxed. So relaxed they didn't seem to concerned when I called to tell them that I got sick after the noodle bowl.. I hate leaving terrible reviews but this is the case when it's fair. It took me exactly 4 hours to start feeling nauseous after eating there and after a night of sickness and stomach pain later I feel better."}
{"text":"I love local small cafes like this. Everyone was super friendly and even educated me on some great vegan teas and coffees I'm excited to try the next time I stop by. Great food. Great vibes. Great people! I would highly recommend and already have to some of my coworkers! Vegan or not you'll love this place!"}
{"text":"Impressive! I am a coffee person and it's hard to imagine how good is their brown sugar latte. Bonus is it's dairy free! I also ordered the raw jalapeño popper, which was beyond expectations also! 
I love the chilled vibe, friendly staffs, and their large variety of desserts. Definitely going back~~"}
{"text":"This is my favorite vegan restaurant for brunch. Their menu is small but every options is bomb! I've been there for dinner a few times and their food is pretty good."}
{"text":"I've been to 24 Carrots twice now.  The first time was a slow Monday afternoon in mid-December.  The place is cute and very welcoming.  I like that you can sit at a table or at the couch.  They were out of carrot cake, so we bought a carrot muffin instead.  It tasted good but was a bit on the dry side.  We ordered two smoothies: strawberry fields forever and orange dreamsicle.  Straberry fields was yummy, but the orange dreamsicle tasted like a bland berry smoothie (where was the orange?).

Our last visit was this past weekend.  We ordered the hummus plate.  The hummus was good (though I wouldn't call it \"SUPER addictive\"), the pita was fresh, and veggies were crisp and tasty.  We tried to get a pumpkin pie smoothie, but they were out of pumpkin.  Then we ordered the chocolate pie and were told they were out of vegan yogurt.  We said that was fine, could they add some peanut butter?  Sure.  It came to us as a liquidy drink...not a smoothie.  It was like chocolate milk...we didn't order vegan chocolate milk.  We commented on how liquidy it was and were then told that, oh by the way, they were also out of vegan protein powder, which would have made it thicker.  We asked him to add a banana, to which he obliged.  He returned our drink, and it wasn't much thicker but did have a bit more taste.  Not something I would ever recommend.

If I go here again, I'll have to try an actual meal, because I haven't been impressed with their smoothies.  Tip to the owner:  offer one or two green smoothies (spinach) or spinach as an add-in in addition to the veggie green juices."}
{"text":"My favorite place to. Get healthy AND delicious breakfasts and lunch. The new location is wonderful."}
{"text":"I love the food here and I crave it often. Usually, I order 2 items because I can't decide between the new, delicious menu items that rotate each week. The juices are great and I love the \"happy hour\" they have from 2-5 on some days of the week. They use local, fresh ingredients from nearby farms. However, the service is incredibly slow. Generally, there are only two people working: one person running the register, answering the phone, and making juices, and another person making ALL of the orders in the back. Even when the restaurant is almost dead, I wait for over 30 minutes for a to-go order. One time, the girl behind the counter answered some questions about the menu for me and ended up recommending an item. When my order was up 30 minutes later, it was a totally different dish. She said I never ordered the other one - even though she recommended it to me! Then they told me they were out of the ingredients for the dish I ordered. I wasn't even upset about that - I know that they order fresh ingredients from local farms and they are bound to run out of something. But, I was there for over 45 minutes waiting for a simple raw dish. The owner was very nice, but the service was slow and she wasn't behind the counter helping, she was closing out for the day and working on her computer. Meanwhile, people were waiting a ridiculously long time for their food."}
{"text":"This place is healthy.  I knew that going in and that is what we were looking for.  I did not know that it was vegan.  I don't think I would have gone if I had known.  Since we had driven out of way to eat here we stayed anyway.  Tried two smoothies - Green Peace and Tropic Thunder.  I really liked the Green Peace with avocado and spinach.  The kids liked the Tropic Thunder - I didn't get to try it.  Also had the buffalo cauliflower wrap... with a regular tortilla and with a gluten free tortilla.  It was very tasty and different.  Was impressed with the gluten free tortillas until they get hard, then they are hard as a rock.  Didn't care for the hummus... too chunky and thick.  The salad was very basic as a side to the sandwich.  Tried the Dan Dan Noodles and really liked them, even the fake meat on top.  My kids refused to eat the food so I can't imagine I will be back very often."}
{"text":"Best vegan nachos I've ever had! The cashew nacho cheese and cilantro jalapeño sauce is so good! And the sweetness of the beets works so well together! Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"The food was okay but nothing special. The staff was friendly. I may consider visiting again but I'm in no rush to return."}
{"text":"Hello everyone!



Ok, here we go.

I have to admit that I am going to struggle with this review because I had such a great experience my first time and i wanted to enjoy again, but?

I have been thinking over the last couple of hours about how i could just not say anything and let it go but i cannot. After all i do say what is on my mind even if people do not like it.

All I wanted was what I had the last time, an tofu scramble sandwhich with blt and siracha. At the time of placing the order I was told the tofu scramble now comes with cranberries mixed in. Not so good.

(In a conversation with Sasha about this review I have been informed that the \"egg salad\" which is actually a different kind of tofu scramble is the one that comes with cranberries, not the tofu scramble which comes with sauteed veggies. Being vegan I regard \"egg salad\" as \"tofu scramble\" which is what was on my original sandwhich which I mentioned with very high regard in my first review. This sandwhich is available and is delicious. I have agreed to update my review because of this information and am sorry for any misunderstanding. I have changed my star rating from 1 to 2 stars, however the remainder of this review will remain unchanged)

So i move on and decided to split a burger w/ the wifster. All is ok. I will try something new, and save some calories too. Her decision 

Veggie Masala Burger 
Spice Infused Veggie Burger, Romaine, Tomato, Cucumber, Red Onion, Cheddar topped with a Jalapeno Cilantro Pesto, plus bacon,minus cheese, Veronica style,w/pineapple carrot slaw. $9.95 plus$1.50 for 2 slices of bacon.

Total bill w/tip $15.00

Last time the \"homemade\" bacon was unfricken believable. By far the best I had ever had. Thick, chewy, kinda crunchy, yum. 

So i beg and plead for them to show me how to do this, or at least give me some pointers and i got the resounding and very hob nobby \"UH- no\". And even this is ok, I understand that they wish to keep thier secret. I am here to tell you that todays bacon was not even close to last time. thin and soggy with no flavor. kinda like, Morningstar Farms in looks and taste. Far from \"homemade\". 

On to the burger. Gross man! Could not even finish it! Cannot even describe that flavor but E double UU! I did not taste ANY jalapeno cilantro pesto at all. And yes I know what this tastes like I make it for a pizza sauce at home. Super dry and crumbly. All i could taste was cinnamon.

Even my wife had a hard time finishing hers.

The pineapple carrot salad was not my favorite. I only hope the ton of white stuff mixed into it was Veganaise. 

What happened to a good ol dill pickle. Sorry just not my fav, and for $15.00 clams my expectations are higher. 

I left so hungry I had to get a Clif bar at Trader Joes so I at least could make it home. \"I came all the way from Maricopa for this\" is what I believe I spat out of my mouth when I got in the car afterward.

Serverly dissapointing!

Review time!

Curbage: 10 (love it)
P factor: I dunno, but all is very clean and this is awesome
Ordering; 10 (quick)
Waiting time: 9 ( much faster this time)
Food: 3 (Nice try just gross man)
Food Value: -10 (couldnt even finish half of a $15 dollar burger
Summary: 5 ( I am on the fence today, kinda dont know to sum it up so I have to ponder further, and hope that next time will be better.)

I want 24 carrots to work for me bad. It represents most of what I am looking for i a restaurant meal.  Today unfortunately did not, and with the changes that I saw on the new menu, I am unsure of returning, therefore I have to give only 1 star today quite simply because I could not even finish one half of an overpriced vegan burger. Sorry 24 Carrots todays meal just does not cut it for me. 

Late 

Gordo

ps I will keep 24 carrots on my Best Vegan Eats for now but....."}
{"text":"Anytime you can find a delicious and truly healthy dessert, you tell the world about it. That's what I'm doing. This is the place. I would give five stars, but the prices are pretty high. Yes, it's a specialty restaurant, but it's almost empty every time I go. I don't think it's just me who would eat there more often if it was less spendy."}
{"text":"Delicious and healthy juices, awesome music, excellent customer service. What more could you ask for? Kendell was super friendly and provided great service!"}
{"text":"So excited to have found this place.  My teenage daughter is vegan and we struggle to find a restaurant she can eat at.  We had the apple quinoa and oats for breakfast.  Delicious with lots of fruit and oats had great texture.  Staff was super friendly too.  Can't wait to try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"Vegan. Organic. Tasty!! Food, smoothies, juice, coffee. Really enjoyed the butternut squash taco!"}
{"text":"Between Starbucks and Subway sits something natural and organic to eat and drink. The owner Sasha couldn't be nicer and more friendly. She is very knowledgeable about fruits, veggies, and other health related topics. I asked for something wheat and dairy free and she whipped up a special veggie drink for me that had some bite (ginger), some sweet (carrots), and some healthy greens (Kale, cucumber, etc). I highly recommend 24Carrots. All the drinks I've had and even the vegan chili she made one day are great."}
{"text":"Sasha and the crew have done an amazing job with the new place, and the food just amazing as it was at the previous location. I'm excited for them and I'm excited to have 24 Carrots closer to my work. Thank you Sasha, Amanda, and all the rest of the crew (both new and continuing)."}
{"text":"Really amazing food. Fantastic fresh juices and smoothies. And the service is very personable and great.  The staff are always welcoming, friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I feel like I'm Eminem coming out of the funk of two years of a drug addled depressive yet transformative roller coaster. 

Man, what a wild ride. Everything is a process. But my head is clear and this is a Yelp that's been demanding to be written for a while.

Yesterday, Amber W tweeted something very insightful. She basically said, I can't believe in the year 2010 or whatever year this is people still 1) smoke 2) believe in God in the traditional judeo christian sense 3) eat meat. Now I can imagine someone who does all three, or hell, any of the three, must believe that Amber and I and our cohort are pretty fucking stupid to think that any of those things are going away. For you, Sir, for you, Madam, I just hope you live long enough to see it because it's coming and true morality, true Golden Rule style living, will rear it's pretty little head. 

Sasha is someone who could give Damon B of Green fame a run for his money. She's creative. She's talented. Everything is delicious. There's no titanium disulphide in my food. It's fresh. Sometimes it's raw. It's local. It's largely organic. Did I mention it's delicious. She's experimental. She's kind. She's generous. She's all the things that we look for in a leader of the righteous food movement. BTW, there's no way she'd endorse that statement. That's all me. 

I get the vegan delight pizza. I get the masala burger. I often get the specials. The fruit smoothies are the best you will ever have. Seriously. Do something you can feel good about. Support this local business putting out the very best product at a very fair price... I promise you will not be disappointed no matter what your thoughts are on vegetarianism or vegan living."}
{"text":"I finally had the time to get to 24 Carrots today, only to find out they're not open on Sundays. Very disappointing, so I drove a few miles to Piicazzo's (NE corner of Kyrene and Warner) to get my organic juice. I'll try to get to 24 Carrots another time, but Sundays seem to be my out and about day."}
{"text":"First and foremost I am not a vegan or a vegetarian, but I do eat as healthy as i can. I had 90 minutes to kill on a Friday and I was hungry and I'm slimming down for my Mexico trip in a couple months, this seems perfect for dinner. 
Hipster little place, decor and staff. The kid behind the counter, was NO help with the menu telling me \"I really haven't tried much on the menu\"......great I'll have to wing it.
I ordered the jalapeño poppers, jalapeño hummus inside a small red pepper over a giant plate of lettuce. Also the the Tu-No salad, tuna flavored quinoa over some greens. then I had a green tea. It was good and different for me, I'd come back if I was in the area.  I felt a little on the pricey side, my meal was $21 for those 3 things."}
{"text":"I am not vegan or vegetarian, but the freshness of 24 Carrots' dishes and ingredients is what drew me in, and I was not disappointed! I ordered the carrot cake pancakes and they were to die for! Yes the meal was on the pricier side, but knowing my food was all natural made it worth the price, and I could definitely taste the difference. It's a shame I don't live in Arizona anymore; I look forward to going to 24 Carrots the next time I am out there and trying something new- or just ordering the carrot cake pancakes again!"}
{"text":"New location, new menu same name.

First off this is a cafe and juice bar as the food is not just some second thought. There are vegetarian, raw and vegan dishes, salads, burgers wraps quesadillas and more. And now there is ample seating for all. However the patio has yet to open.

My BLT burger was decent, but the patty itself was a bit too carby and dry for my tastes. We also got the browned coli-flour rolls and they were amazing, Great flavors.

Portion size for the prices is a bit small but this seems to be the norm in this segment.  

Hopefully they will stay open a bit later for dinner."}
{"text":"The black Forrest mushroom quesadilla was one of the best tasting items I have had in a long time anywhere. As for my other dish it was decent but I am just not the biggest fan of \"raw\" food.

Despite the name this place is much more of a cafe than a juice bar as they have solid food and not just snacks. 

Each dish is $10-13 a bit pricey for what it is but this seems to be the going rate for local veg cuisine. 

As for the food I had the \"ravioli, which was really beat slices with a creamy vegan sauce and some salad. It was good and a bit rich which is surprising as it was raw, for me the flavors were not varied enough. We also had the aforementioned quesadilla which was amazing large chunks of sauteed mushrooms and a few other items in a green tortilla. 

Now if they could just be open for dinner."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying I haven't eaten here yet, but I have picked up some of their green juice drinks which have always been awesome! Love their Field of Greens drink - not bitter, not sweet, Just riiiight! I always forget about this place except when I'm thinking of where I can get an awesome juice drink. I saw someone order their tofuizo (tofu chirizo) and I was going to order one had I not had a bizillion things to do today.  I'm coming back and I hope they have the tofuizo next time I'm there(getting hungry thinking about it now)"}
{"text":"The service is really slow. I waited 50 minutes for a PB&B smoothie. In between that the guy who was making my smoothie decided to stop and answer 50 questions about the by ingredients of a cupcake for a customer who came in after me. When it finally came. It tasted funny and I decided to throw it away. Wasted 7 dollars and 50 minutes."}
{"text":"I wandered in here early morning while doing errands.  I was craving for some veggie juice but didn't have time to make my own at home.  They offer smoothies, fruit and vegetable juices and healthy breakfast.  The cucumber cooler made my morning.  I can't wait to try the rest of the food offerings."}
{"text":"This place is BOMB. The beetball sandwich, tacos, and the peanut butter candy bar were all heavenly! Love the vibe, atmosphere, and people. Laid back, fresh, and friendly. I absolutely recommend this place to everyone!!"}
{"text":"Came in to eat today with my GF, and my first impression was the open area of the restaurant. We both tried their special which was a Cajun garden burger that either came with chips and salsa or a salad. The presentation of the burger was great  but the sides were not appealing. I ordered the chips in salsa which looked like they had served me the crumbs from an empty chip bag you buy at Costco. The burger itself was not that good that even my gf did not finish. 

I would not recommend this place until they improve their brand and prices.'"}
{"text":"I cannot believe it has taken me so long to review 24 Carrots. I have been going there regularly for years! The reason why I eat there often is because the food is AMAZING. Sasha is the owner and she puts so much love and creativity into her meals using the freshest organic ingredients from local farms. They have weekly specials and the menu is always changing. 
The flavor profile of her food is so great with such depth. The desserts are to die for and the coffee is great too. My favorite entrees are the carnival butternut squash enchiladas, breakfast burritos and raw pasta marinara, but really you can't go wrong with anything you order. Their carrot cake is my favorite dessert. 
The location is great too. It's in the same strip mall as Changing Hands book store and Trader Joe's."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times now and I think it's fantastic.  I had an enchilada burger and I had me some \"bacon\" the last time I was here, both times to much satisfaction.

Dude, one time my girlfriend ordered \"eggs\" benedict, and it even had a runny yolk and everything.  The lady who runs this place is a fuckin' magician with vegan food.  So, so delicious."}
{"text":"I had a breakfast burrito here this morning and it was so good that I was sad once it was gone because I wanted to keep eating it. It was amazing. They have a cute little library in there as well."}
{"text":"I had the Buddha bowl, and hummus and veggies. The Buddha bowl was decent, the veggies were plentiful, but the hummus was tasteless, and it had somewhat of a \"runny\" consistency.  Also, it took them more than 20 minutes to get my order ready, which normally wouldn't be so bad, but everything I ordered was raw and the restaurant wasn't particularly busy. This is my first experience with 24 Carrots, and I am unimpressed."}
{"text":"Ohhhh yum. Traveling to Phoenix I found 24 Carrots and had the most delicious lunch - gluten free, Golden Chai Latte and took something to go for my flight.  I couldn't have been happier. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Really can't get much better. Had the vegan tacos. Could of had just a bit more faux chik. Soup tasty and healthy. Corn tortilla outstanding along with all taste and presentation. Gal and guy up front nice smiling and seen happy. That is nice. Clean and pretty big menu. Thanks"}
{"text":"Chose the vegan breakfast bowl and WOW do these folks know how to serve up LOVE in a bowl !! They are strong supporters official produce and proud to showcase that to the patrons. The vibe is laid back, cozy, clean and spiritually inviting- while still modest and natural. Prices are very reasonable on the higher side but with due respect- I feel if you want good for you food that tastes like it should - it's worth it! I can't wait to turn my loved ones on to this tucked away little Tempe gem"}
{"text":"OMG I loooove this place!! I used to go to Chaco Canyon Cafe in Seattle and I missed it so much. So I was delighted to find this place. I got the raw tacos. AMAZEBALLS! I also got a slice of raw lemon creme pie. It has coconut \"cream\" on top. Wow... incredible. The carrots and hummus are delish too. Presentation was great (I am visual and food looking pretty is great!) The staff was really friendly. I couldn't ask for a better experience. I can't wait to come back again. :D"}
{"text":"Came for the special quesadilla but they were sold out, so I opted for the vegan cheese steak. It was so delicious! Everything tasted fresh and that cheese steak definitely lived up to my high standards. The manager was also super nice. I'll be back, Hopefully to finally try a quesadilla!"}
{"text":"24 Carrots is what a small business should be! Friendly staff and you can tell that the owner Sasha is very passionate about the food and smoothies they serve.
 Me and my boyfriend have come into the shop about 4 times now and everytime  we haven't been disappointed!  It's the perfect place for vegan, vegetarians, or anybody who's open to fresh organic food that's delicious! They only use what it's in season and I love the breakfast items. They are always making new things and having specials so make sure you add them on facebook or follow on twitter to find out what new dishes they have! The menu is impressive, with lots of items to choose from which makes it hard to decide but keeps you coming back for more!
Our first time there we had their vegan french toast(delicious) with 100% maple syrup and fresh strawberries and kiwi. To go with the french toast we got their vegan eggs benedict which they made an \"egg\"  out of tofu and actually had fake yolk, on a toasted bread w/  slices of avocado, and their homemade tofu bacon. A perfect breakfast combo! Another mouthwatering breakfast dish we've had before is their breakfast burrito with tofu scramble, squash, and other veggies, also filled with tofu bacon and a salad on the side.  I also recommend their mushroom burger and of course their smoothies! All natural and delicious! 

Another awesome thing about 24 carrots is that they also use biodegradable cups and straws made of corn. You can tell they're a compassionate business that is serving healthier food and using earth-friendly products.  The shop itself is quite charming, not a big place but a nice place to bring a few friends and play a board game, chat, and get delicious food. The prices are reasonable if it is over 10 bucks they give you a lot of food and me and my boyfriend end up sharing it or getting two things and they're happy to split it on two plates for us.  For all the whole and organic ingredients it's definitely worth paying the extra dollars for a fullfilling meal. 
 I love this place and that's why I keep coming back :)"}
{"text":"Received a gift card from our thoughtful son and daughter-in-law and they met us here for delightful lunch. Being the only vegan, I was concerned if they would be okay with the food. They were more than OK and look forward to returning again soon. I had the raw tacos and they were delicious-  Filling, wonderful combination of ingredients and visually appealing. This place has a quirky atmosphere that is welcoming and friendly. I also enjoyed the Voodoo fresh juice- a hint of heat that blends perfectly with the other ingredients."}
{"text":"I was traveling to Tempe and am so happy that my sister and I went here. It is an absolute gem--from the friendly workers to the delicious, nutritious vegan food, this place is as good as it gets! Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Well, 2nd time trying to get a smoothie from this place. Today they were actually open this time. But I took a menu and sat down to 15 min but no one came to take my order. Didn't see a register or order taking bar either. Back to Zumba Juice 4 times a week."}
{"text":"I guess the only reason you would want to go there is if you were a vegan since there doesn't appear to be a lot of vegan restaurants around.  Otherwise, stay away, it's not worth the slow service or price of the food.  The food was so-so, lunch for 2 was close to $30, and the help. . .well, not a lot I can say about the help.  For starters, I wanted water with my meal.  After ordering and sitting at the table, we were brought our food and my friend got her tea, but no water for me.  I went back up the cash register where 3-4 employees were back in the kitchen area.  I was able to get someone's attention and told them I had wanted water with my half sandwich and small salad.  When it was brought to the table, I was told I was supposed to get it myself.  Huh?  Okay, I'm going to ignore that.  I eat my meal, it was okay, but I'm still hungry an hour later.  We get up to leave and head to the door and are instructed to go back and clear the table and put the dishes in a bin.  Really. . .?  I guess if you're used to the routine there, okay, but first time there and your multiple employees behind the counter aren't doing anything?  And that sucks because I left a 15% tip up front when I ordered.  That will be the last time for me.  I'm not sure how they manage to stay open.  I guess it's the juice bar which I didn't try."}
{"text":"It's like a pit stop in heaven for vegans. Plenty of options.
Ordered -
Laughing Buddha Bowl : tasted delicious. Cooked to perfection, ingredients blend together to give you mouth watering tastes. Served not too cold not too warm. 
Cucumber Cool: obviously cucumber juices are my favorite things. Tasted good with parsley etc.

Why 4 stars?? I feel price is too much for the quantity. I could easily get ~2.5 meals outside for the price (not vegan obviously), but I'm also comparing it with other vegan restaurants."}
{"text":"This is absolutely my go-to vegan breakfast joint in the Phoenix metro. The tofu and cauliflower scrambles and their various combinations are UNREAL, the huge variety of pastries are yummy, and unlike at many even vegetarian restaurants, you can actually get VEGAN chai. So for a solid, delicious, and reasonably priced breakfast and lunch, this is your place."}
{"text":"When I first went raw I was worried it meant that I would never eat out again so you can imagine my excitement when I found out about 24 Carrots. I went for Raw Wednesday (although I believe they have a raw option everyday) and had the \"Cheese Burger.\" It was so delicious that I ended up ordering the other raw option on the menu to take home for dinner. The atmosphere was casual and welcoming and the staff was willing and able to answer all of my questions.  This is one you should add to your list whether you are raw or not!"}
{"text":"First of all, I'm not vegan or vegetarian or a healthy eater. So to plain out state it, I love meat and anyone who knows me knows I'm pickier than a 3 year old when it comes to food. I don't try new things and order the same thing at every spot. I hate change. So...when I saw them advertise smoothies, that is one thing I will try because I LOVE smoothies. I was skeptic due to the fact they're on the vegan side of things but let me tell you...I was shocked to find at the end of my ordered meal it was all gone, and not in the trash. I actually ate it all! Their smoothies are fresh and delicious and definently don't taste all sugary like those artificial places. I live 5 minutes away and between leaving the cafe and getting home my smoothie was gone, literally. I got a BLT but opted with no bread and had them mix it into a salad which was some kind of spicy but good house dressing. Their bacon wasn't real pork but still quite edible. I opted for a few of their gluten free treats as well which were actually quite good considering it's hard to get a good gluten free dessert right. While I can't say this is my first choice, but I most definently will be back, especially for their smoothies. As for the service, the guy taking my order was super nice and my order was brought to me in a reasonable time."}
{"text":"The Pumpkin Enchilada Stack for $10.75 is fun, delicious and a little spicy.

They have several raw dishes."}
{"text":"I'd heard good things about the place from a couple of people so I wanted to give it a try and I wasn't disappointed.  Nice vibe in the place, friendly people and tasty food!  I went with the intention of picking something up over my lunch hour but I ended up making a new friend and we sat and talked about food.

I believe it was the owner up front, she was friendly and passionate about the place.  I went with the 1/2 Mediterranean veggie sammy and 1/2 Wanted Panda salad (they were out of the Mediterranean bean salad).  The sammy was plump full of fresh & tasty veggies, homemade hummus on a nice toasty grain bread.  The salad was big and also very fresh, loved the tangy/sweet dressing - with a proper serving size of about 2 Tbsp THANK YOU!  (hate having a nice salad dripping with 1/3 cup of gooey dressing)  

I thought both items had a nice amount of flavor and the veggies tasted like they'd spent a good amount of time in the earth as they should. I finished off with a Cliffs of Dover fruit juice blend, was a little sweeter than I expected but that was just fine with my sweet tooth.  $15 total for my lunch, and I was full & satisfied for the entire afternoon.

My new friend went with the falafel burger and it looked so good, nice and moist and she loved the sauce.  Another customer asked her what it was because it looked so tasty.  I'd just made falafel the day before or I'd have gone with it - oh well, next time.  The other burgers sound great too!

I noticed some reviews commenting about 24C being out of different things, as they were when I went.  With a varied daily menu with fresh ingredients its hard to anticipate so I don't fault them for that.  

I'll definitely be back again.  Yes it's a bit pricy, takes a little longer and the food might be a little different each time.  And thats fine by me.   This place reminded me why we don't like chains and delicious food and great conversation go so well together."}
{"text":"Food was fresh and flavor combinations went well together. Have to try the nachos! Omg they were so good, they were better than expected. The \"Good Juju\" smoothie was so yummy, banana and nut butter. The dining area is open and friendly not matchy matchy. Overall I definitely will be coming back here."}
{"text":"The food here was so very delicious! I went for Sunday brunch and had the Good Juju smoothie and the Arizona bowl with cauliflower scramble. The good juju was ok, I'm not a huge fan of the cinnamon, but the almond and coconut combo was nice. However the Arizona bowl was *phenomenal*. It's a little bowl but packed with fresh veggies and flavor. At first I thought the bowl was too small but then I couldn't even finish it! It's a rich, dense, and saucy bowl of cooked veggies. The service that day was pretty mediocre. Every one was exceptionally nice and kind but they messed up different aspects our order three times (!!!). If they weren't so darn sweet and charming I might have minded but I enjoyed the staff's company and didn't mind sticking around a little longer chatting with them. Plus I got a delicious and nutritious meal at the end.

I really hope they open up one of these in downtown Phoenix! Green is so unhealthy, and Bragg's needs a friend who makes smoothies and juices! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I had the breakfast burrito, so hot n tasty. Full of flavor, large enough for 2 meals or hungry hungry hippo."}
{"text":"The service is awesome. The food is delicious. If it were closer to me, I'd be there a lot more frequently. Great vegan spot! And I love that they have juice and raw food. Yum!"}
{"text":"We live in the area and decided to try it....I think it is WAY over priced for what you get.  Compared to other places around Tempe and the area like Delish or Greens where main items are between $6-$9, 24 Carrots is charging $11+ for the same items also their juice prices are way to high for the amount!  I went ahead and ordered a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for my kids.  They charged me $5.00 for 1/2 of a sandwich and a few pieces of fruit. It was truly pathetic that they think they can get away with charging that kind of money for literally 1 single piece of bread with about 1 teaspoon of jelly and peanut butter on it that cost them about 20 cents to make.  I don't mind paying for my kids food if they actually get food but if I have to spend $10.00 for 1 full PB&J sandwich then I have to express my concern.  My beet burger was good....not $11 dollars good, unless they lower their prices then I fear they will not be around for a very long time. I went recently to Daily Dose and spent the same amount on a HUGE vegetarian burger and order of kids cheesy pasta for my two small kids to share...we both had leftovers, but not at 24 Carrots we all left hungry.  I should of know by the sign that is posted in the front window that says \"no outside food or drinks\" that others must of tried to bring in cheaper items because they too didn't want to pay for over priced mediocre food either. ;-("}

{"text":"Moved here from Chicago. I am a nutrition major and have a particular (vegan) diet. This place is awesome....everything is unique, fresh and tasty. Although it is pricey, they have some of the best pressed juices and smoothies. I highly recommend their beet detox juice or their almond banana smoothies."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place and Dan Dan noodle bowl sounds and looks really good (on Yelp pics) but when I got mine, it shocked me, in a bad way. The picture I took was before I had my first bite. But the noodle looks much darker than other pictures here. And it was EXTREMELY salty! I thought to myself it's okay just drink water because I don't wanna bother them... But after three bites I can't stand it... :( I'm sorry I really want to like this dish, but it's just too much for me. It was nice tho they made me another one with soy sauce on the side so I can add it myself. It's much better.... I would recommend you get soy sauce on the side and add it to your taste. Other than that things are good. And I may try some other things here again. So 3 stars."}
{"text":"So delicious! Hard to decide what to have, but ordered the vegan \"BLT.\"  It was SOOO good, Bread was yummy and toasted, veggies crisp and fresh, \"bacon\" was smoky and tasty, dressing was a delicious addition.  Served with carrots and fresh hummus. Reasonably priced.  Only negatives: staff could be friendlier, and they were out of a few items before the dinner rush. So many smoothies and teas (all made to order) to choose from. Desserts looked delicious, but was too satisfied to indulge in one of them (pina colada cake - I'll see you next visit)."}
{"text":"So I decided to give 24 Carrots another try since the first time I had gone there I left without ordering due to the rude attitude of the workers. I ordered a hummus plate to go. Simple enough. When the menu says \"seasonal veggies\" I assume it means not veggies I receive with my chicken wings (I got carrots, cucumbers and celery). When I received my food before I even touched the box I asked if they could switch the cucumbers and celery for more carrots since I dislike them. They said no. So I figured I could overlook that as long as the hummus was good. I got home and realized the \"pita bread\" was nothing more then cracker wafers. And the big kicker is the hummus tasted like bland baby food. I called to complain and the manager, Amanda, proceeded to tell me I was wrong because their hummus is the most popular thing there and that the pita bread was lavosh bread. I worked in customer service for a long time so this really pissed me off. The proper thing to do would be to offer for me to come back and then replace it with something that might have more of what I was looking for flavor-wise. I had just had a great workout and wanted some fresh, flavorful food to eat for lunch. I will never go back to this restaurant, which is sad because I really do enjoy eating healthy and I have also advised my friends to avoid this place as well and to head to Pomegranate Cafe instead. At least that place has friendly staff, better food and they won't have to wait an hour for their food."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful!  I am not a vegan, but if I was it would probably be the only place I would ever eat!  I went in and ordered a juice (carrot apple orange).  It was fresh and delicious, but I am dying to come back here to try their food though.  Everything on the menu looks really yummy and the place has such a laid back atmosphere.  I am from Chicago and places like this usually get a bad rep for being super snotty and judgmental, but the servers are friendly and not afraid to strike up a conversation.
The only thing this place is missing is great hours.  I am a teacher and I would LOVE to be able to order a fresh juice in the morning instead of my usual Starbucks coffee which never comes the way I order it, but they open so late that's a definite no.  They also aren't open late either so after school is out of the question if I decide to stay late.  Come on 24 Carrots!! Extend those hours!!!"}
{"text":"First time visiting this spot in Tempe and I got the BLT with hummus and carrots was $10.99  and my husband got the Gardeners Tofu scramble with potato hash, vegan bacon and fruit $11 with cheese for and extra cost. The food was good but for the price you do not get much for example my husbands plate looked like a kids portion. I am not sure that it will be put in our regular vegan rotation but I would return again if I am in the area for nothing else but to try one of the juices."}
{"text":"I love this place but the service is incredibly slow.  Like mind-numbingly slow.  I took my sister there for a \"quick bite to eat\".  It took nearly 30 minutes to get two smoothies and one quesadilla out to our table.  It looked like there were 3 people working (1 in the front running the register and 2 in the kitchen).  The smoothies were delicious but the guy making them was eating bits of fruit while he was dropping the ingredients into the blender for our smoothies....I was a bit concerned.  

The quesadilla was amazing but it just took forever.  The first time we went was just as slow as the second time. So I don't see the service time improving but the food is still good.  

I always think about going there but I just never like having to allot extra time for waiting around forever.  It always seems like the people calling in their orders get priority service.  Maybe that's the way to go?  I'll have to try that out sometime.  During our last visit a person called and placed a phone order just as we sat down at our table.  Before our food was ready she had time to drive down to the restaurant, her food order was prepped, cooked and boxed, then she came in to pay and left....all before we ate.  :( I don't know how much food she had ordered but they gave her a big bag."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for awhile but its a little far from my work. I got the hummus and enchiladas and they were amazing. Worth the drive! I took it to go however the restaurant is clean and staff is very friendly. I would definitely recommend and the desserts look great!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Everything is super fresh and healthy. Their green drinks are great. Their salads are pretty good too."}
{"text":"Buffalo cauliflower wrap is great! Has kinda a Cajun tasting spice to it too. Definitely would recommend. This is my first visit but I'm excited to try more options for dinner!"}
{"text":"Very tasty had pumpkin latte made with real
Pumpkin nothing artificial and chickpea burger.
Both were enjoyable and gluten free. House made bun I think it was potato rosemary... very nice to see not store bought but made on site.  Everything is made fresh onsite.  Got a gluten free cookie bar for later. Friend had a green smoothie made fresh with no powders.  Lives up to its reputation of fresh vegan vegetarian mostly gluten free. The pricing is right on track with other restaurants using organic and fresh ingredients.  The staff used food handler gloves for gluten free 

The only thing that was distracting was a very loose dress code.  I'm not up for booty shorts by restaurant personnel it's very unprofessional even in a casual restaurant.  I'm paying for atmosphere and food, so I don't know if I'll be back."}
{"text":"I worked down the street from this place for years and finally went in because I was doing a detox and needed a fresh fruit drink.  Much to my surprise they have a huge menu with great food, drinks, baked goods, and desserts.  I never walk away from this place with a heavy feeling and I know that I am eating much better.  They only use fruits and veggies that are in season so be open to trying new things.  

They always have a veggie burger special and make sure you get there early before it sells out.  My favorite is the fruity almond toast and pumpkin pie smoothie.

Make sure you go to happy hour between the hours 2-5 Monday through Friday when the drinks are 1/2 price."}
{"text":"My co-workers and I decided to try this place for lunch.  I was slightly skeptical to begin with being the carnivore that I am, but I figured I'd branch out beyond my typical lunch spots.  The ambience was as I expected a vegetarian/vegan cafe would be with a spiritual/yogi vibe.  When we got there, a few people were seated and it was far from what I would consider busy.  We placed our orders and took a seat while we waited for our food...and waited...and waited.  My colleagues ordered smoothies and a salad and I got the portabello cheese steak sandwich with a cup of the spicy roasted tomato vegetable soup.  All items that you would think could be put together and be in customer's hands within 10 - 15 minutes tops.  From placing our order to having food in hand, this quick 'to-go' lunch stop ended up taking almost 40 minutes! 

Although I thought my food was flavorful, my sandwich did not stay in sandwich form for long.  With every bite, more and more of the sandwich kept spilling out the sides.  At the same time, my soup was more of the consistency of chunky mashed potatoes.  Unfortunately for my co-workers, their salad left a lot to be desired and they resorted to tossing it out.  For the time our adventure took and the price (forgot to mention that you should probably be ready for some sticker shock), I probably won't give this place another attempt."}
{"text":"Well, I see this place bought a ton of Yelp advertising, which included the decent of the Yelp minions, again, coincidentally ALL thought this juice shop in a Tempe, Arizona, strip mall, is a 5 Star place.

Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against 24 Carrots Juice Bar & Café, but 5 Stars? Just look at the photos.

To me, this place is 3/5 Stars, but I love their big helpings of fresh veggies, their local do-good story, and their HUGE DETERMINATION to succeed. 

I love the \"Do whatever it takes\" can-do attitude.

24 CARROTS JUICE BAR & CAFÉ: THEIR STORY

7 years ago, Sasha got thirsty. Really REALLY thirsty. And so, she began on a quest to quench that thirst. But everywhere she looked she was faced with the same problem. Drinks, juices and smoothies filled with artificial ingredients and excessive sugar.

Realizing the serious need for a healthy and tasty snacking alternative, she came up with '24 Carrots.' In 2007, she was joined by her best friend and cousin, Shyam, who brought with him a wealth of business intuition and a very discerning palate.

THE STORY & SERVICE EXPERIENCE 

I was first introduced to this place because of my trainer.

My trainer is IN LOVE WITH JUICING and LOVES this place.

When we went in, I was nonplussed. It just doesn't seem like a place where I'd usually hangout. That's just my personal bias though. The fresh treats refrigeration display only had a 1/2 of a carrot cake and was storing some ingredients that weren't for sale.

The menu is on a chalk board. I ordered the Voodoo Child juice.

It took about 10 minutes to receive two juices and a piece of carrot cake to-go. We subsequently tasted the carrot cake and it didn't taste that good to me.

My juice was served room temperature/warm. Maybe I'm too picky, maybe I don't like my juice warm, but it made it difficult to drink. In the juice's favor, it was JUICE juice, not a smoothie, meaning it's made with REAL food, not with sherbet or excess sugar fillers.

CONCLUSION 

I've been several times, mostly because it's close to my home, I love their commitment to healthy food, and I do love supporting deserving local business.

4/5 RECOMMEND

*Plenty of parking out front.

{"text":"I love this place.  I had the raw green papaya salad and it was amazing.  I love how they use local ingredients in everything.  Will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian, but i strive to eat a 90% whole foods diet and 24 Carrots is the only joint in town where i can get wholesome food made to order, from scratch, with locally and organically grown produce.  I frequent 24 carrots often (5-8 times a month) and I have tried many of the dishes/smoothies on the menu... never to have been disappointed.  However, the true gem is trying Sasha's (the owner) fresh daily specials.  They are as amazing as Sasha is herself!!! If you visit, make sure to say hi...you will fall in love with her and her restaurant!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was great!  Had the Arizona bowl which was sooo yummy!  It's a cute, but small place and the wait to get your food is long, but worth it!  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went in around lunch time. There was literally no one there and no one acknowledged that we were there for several minutes. There was only one item in the entire glass case. We stood around awkwardly until we saw the laminated menus in the holder on the wall. 

We decided to try a juice before we ate so I ordered a carrot-orange juice. It was about $5 and came out luke-cold. I felt pretty disappointed at that point to we left. 

It is a really cool looking place but the service and food seemed really sub-par, especially for the price. I see a lot of positive reviews so I may try this place again but my time there was definitely a 1-star experience."}
{"text":"Had been to this place since my friend was insisting. The moment I entered the cafe, I was awestruck! Pleasant ambience, aroma of the organic food, soothing music, tasty yet healthy food- all that I could've asked for!! I sat on a couch next to a book shelf, where they also having some coloring books with crayons.. it just can't get better than this :)"}
{"text":"Food was expensive and just okay so I was disappointed. Not my favorite vegan place in the area."}
{"text":"The food here NEVER disappoints. Delicious and creative. Absolutely love this place. Recommend to EVERYONE. Vegan and non-Vegans alike!"}
{"text":"I love this place so much!!! I would eat here every day if I could afford to. Prices are good for decent portions of super high quality, fresh, healthy food. They change their menu every week, which keeps it exciting (although I've been longing for the Zucchini Noodle Alfredo to come back ever since I tasted it). My mom and I are addicted to their cashew cream sauce and anything made with it, although unfortunately they make more tomato-based items.

I've had Raw Tacos, Stuffed Tomatoes, salads and breakfast items and LOVED them all. I want to try every single thing on the menu. Oh and don't get me started on the dessert case! Incredibly delicious vegan desserts. As someone who tries to follow a natural, plant-based diet, this place is a dream!

The only negative thing I would say is sometimes service isn't great, and they'll let you stand at the counter for a while without acknowledgement. But some of the people there are sweet. Their juices and smoothies look great, but I make that stuff at home so I haven't tried them. And when I took my sister here, she stated that it was \"too healthy\" for her. That said, this is still a 5-star review because this place is fantastic."}
{"text":"The juice I ordered was grainy--like the produce wasn't cleaned. I'm more than willing to try more there but I was disappointed by the quality of the juice seeing as it's so expensive."}
{"text":"I honestly felt healthier the moment I walked in the door, so after giving myself a little mental pat on the back, I scanned the menu :)

I was there for a quick to-go lunch & their menu was very detailed, the smoothie menu alone was long enough to publish as a short story, lol. All of it great information, so I plan on going back on a weekend. I went for a simple Strawberry fields smoothie. It was HEAVENLY. Thick, creamy & you could taste the agave honey :D

I also asked for Hummus. It was very good. You could taste the lemon & garlic :) It came with cucumber slices, baby carrots, pita bread & celery sticks. It was all packaged in a to go brown box. I was worried that on my drive the hummus would somehow leak from the box because it was scooped straight into the box, no liner. All of my worrying was for not! I'm not sure what that box was made of, but it was beyond sturdy :) No stains or leaks in my car OR on my desk at work :)

I hear they make their own Chai & I can't wait to go back for another visit!
My only complaint would have to be that there was only 1 person working & I had a bit of a wait. When I was on my way out another employee came in, so maybe it's because I was there at 11 am?"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Arizona is lucky to have such a great vegan dining option. We could use a local in TX. The end!"}
{"text":"love this place ! great veggie food.and fresh juices"}
{"text":"So good! Watermelon pizza. Raw deserts. So much delicious fresh food. Go there. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"This was my first encounter with 24 Carrots.  We did takeout.  The person who answered the phone was rude and tried to rush me through the order because they were busy.  I brought her rudeness to her attention because I have a low tolerance for bad customer service.  I hope she didn't spit in our food.  Anyways, we ordered the Zucchini Noodle Salad and Dan Dan Noodles.  The Salad should just be called Zucchini Salad because there were hardly any noodles.  The dressing was flat and tasteless,  needs salt or some over seasoning to bring out the flavor.  Adding red onion to the salad would be a good idea too but I know there are a lot of people out there that do not like onion.  The Dan Dan Noodles were excellent...bravo!"}
{"text":"Over priced for the size of the food servings, but I love that it is all vegan!!! I read multiple reviews about the staff being not so great and slow, but I didn't not have that experience at all. They were friendly, but not in your face. They were also very timely in serving the food. Will be returning for sure."}
{"text":"If \"5 Stars\" is \"as good as it gets\" then 24 Carrots is well deserving of that rating. Because this place in its new location at Guadalupe Rd and McClintock Dr (just west of Baskin Robbins) is nothing short of phenomenal! The new venue boasts of a much larger dining area; is brightly lit (thanks to the entire north wall consisting of windows); has Vegan, Raw, and Gluten-free bakery items; as well as a cutting-edge Veg and Raw menu that consists of innumerable items that will absolutely-positively knock your socks off with flavor!  

One thing that stands out at 24 Carrots, in comparison to other Veg restaurants of this type, is the freshness of the ingredients. Picture produce from local farms. And imagine that same produce being handpicked by the 24 Carrots' owner that very day. Then think taste explosion with each and every bite! As this isn't just a once-in-a-while sort of thing, 24 Carrots changes their menu weekly to reflect what's available from their dedicated local suppliers.

But the food at 24 Carrots is much more than just morsels as fresh as the morning dew. That's because 24 Carrots' redwoods-among-spruce reputation can be found in the sheer uniqueness and creativity of the menu items themselves. For this is no ordinary Veg food consisting of fake-meat sandwiches on vanilla-white bread or bland, grossly-overpriced rice bowls. Instead, you're getting is a bumper crop of culinary originality, food created by climbing mountains that other venues of this type have not yet dared to scale. And just when you think it can't get any better, 24 Carrots routinely tops themselves with some new flavor sensation that will curl your toes and shake, rattle, and roll your taste buds with utter delight!

Also, the new location has a much bigger staff, yet equally as friendly (thanks to greatly-expanded kitchen space having abundant room for more help), and that means they can now crank out their culinary masterpieces in short order.  And there's even comfy couches and chairs to sit on for people waiting for their lickety-split orders. Though, if time is not an issue, feel free to just hang out and sample one of their hit-the-spot juices or smoothies while you surf the web (and, of course, the Yelp website) on 24 Carrots' free Wi-Fi.   

Overall, my two thumbs are up, waaaaaaaaaaaaayyyy up(!) for the new 24 Carrots, which is setting the bar awfully high for outstanding Veg and Raw food in the southeast Valley of the Sun. Bravo!"}
{"text":"If you want to go somewhere that you will be welcomed like family, remembered as a friend and valued as a customer then 24 Carrots should be your next stop.

The Cafe is cozy and comfortable, I feel like I'm going over to a good friends house every time I stop by. 
You can sit and relax and share wonderful conversations, ideas and recipes with Sasha. If there is anything she can do for you she probably will, Sasha has the sweetest kindest spirit and it really reflects into her food. 

There couldn't be more love and passion put into her food if your grandmother made it. 

I've simply Loved everything I've ever ordered here. The menu has some solid choices but for me the magic lies in the daily specials. 
Everyday Sasha creates something new and exciting to tantalize your taste buds using fresh locally grown organic produce. 

You can follow 24 Carrots on twitter and facebook to hear what she's cooking up next."}
{"text":"24 Carrots has a sweet, welcoming environment. The menu has an array of items and accommodates many dietary choices. The reason the star count is so low, then, is the proportion of price to portion. I ordered the BLT for $10. It wasn't a bad sandwich by any means, but certainly meager for the price. Value is important to all, including vegetarians, and it's crucial to be considerate of that when creating a menu."}
{"text":"Absolutely brilliant vegan food, excellent service and great juices! I would recommend this to anyone looking for healthy fare."}
{"text":"Excellent, creative healthy food! I love that it's all vegan, but non vegans would love this place just the same! Very flavorful stuff, also raw options and gluten free options! Everything tastes so fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Comiendo desayuno muy ricos, un burrito con tofu y coliflor y el masala chai grandioso"}
{"text":"I love their food. They have tons of tasty vegan substitutes; everything is vegan.  If it says \"Brie\" it means vegan Brie, not actual Brie. They do a pretty good job of making it all taste like what it is substituting! The desserts are delectable.  Prices are a little higher than I believe they need to be but it's a specialty spot.  I went with a friend once and she wasn't too happy with the service because the employee wanted her to go back up to the counter to finalize payment when a second helping of a dish was ordered.  They do spin the iPad around and have a tip option immediately which makes sense since they bring the items to your table with a number and clean the table for you.  I always tip but still clear my own table so it's a little confusing because there isn't an area to put your plates when you are done or a visible trash can.  Signage may help it be more clear how they serve and clear the tables."}
{"text":"Best place in Chandler to get vegetarian or vegan food.  And now they also have Raw options!  The owner, Sasha is fabulous, and she is always creating something new.  The food is fabulous and everyone is so friendly."}
{"text":"I wish I could give 0 stars.  24 Carrots is a nightmare from the second you walk in.  Look anywhere and you will see filth; from the half-inch of dust on the fan blades to the garbage scraps covering the kitchen floor to the apartment-sized electric griddle where all food is cooked to the single spatula that is scraped on the griddle and then laid straight on a table in a pile of food carnage.  Aside from all of this, the person who helped us did not know the menu and used his computer 4 times as a reference while making our juice.  Understaffed, inefficient, dirty, poorly managed, slow:  just don't go here for your own health and sanity.  Literally, I thought I was on a prank show and could not believe what was happening was actually happening."}
{"text":"I really love the atmosphere of this place. Awesome staff. Awesome food. My only complaint would probably be that the portion sizes are bit small."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Raw and vegan BUT tons of non-soy options!! Sasha and her staff are always accommodating to my specific food allergies and every meal is fresh and delicious. Sometimes it's a bit slow to come out and that's because its all fresh! Worth the wait in my opinion. I luv this place! GMO-FREE."}
{"text":"Amazing, fresh, healthy, local menu. One of the few places I can eat out while still honoring my many dietary restrictions. Helpful and friendly staff. Yummy desserts. Great specials. I have a hard time just ordering one meal here, i usually have to order multiple desserts to go at the very least. Can't speak highly enough of them. Amazing house-made gluten free bread option."}
{"text":"A few years ago, I did a project where I made a database of vegetarian and vegan spots around the greater Phoenix area. This was on the list and I've had it bookmarked since. I was across the street from it and made it over to order an early dinner. 

It wasn't busy when I arrived and I took a look at their menu on Facebook before I came. I was confused that the regular menu didn't show up on my phone (I think it's the file type) but looking at the website, it's there. I ordered their garden burger, which was made with a black bean burger, tomatoes, greens, a blackberry chipotle sauce, and topped with a \"jalapeño popper\". It comes with a choice of side and I did a salad. I also ordered a campfire brownie, which looked really good in the case. 

This place definitely has a hipster vibe to it and there is a lot of seating. The cashier who rung me up wasn't friendly, nor was he rude. I got my food within 10 minutes and it was just handed to me. The worker at the coffee spot was chatting with a customer for a while. Sometimes, you get a feeling about a place or about people and I was not impressed. When I got home and began eating my food the only thing I enjoyed was the brownie, which was pretty delicious and authentic for being vegan. The salad was literally just greens, so nothing special. The vinaigrette was pretty good though. The burger was not very good. The bun was soft, and I would've liked it to be toasted, and the patty itself was soft and not flavorful. The lettuce was almost too crunchy. I know I seem picky but I personally didn't enjoy the food. Pair that with the lack of customer service and I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great healthy Vegan food with loads of Gluten free options. Lots of amazing desserts too"}
{"text":"I recently am unable to eat dairy and was thrilled to find vegan desserts near my home. The hardest part of a no dairy diet, in my opinion, is the fact that I can no longer enjoy conventional desserts. I was able to find a salted caramel bar of sorts, and a cream-filled chocolate cupcake. Both were absolutely delicious! I expected the salted caramel bar body to be moist, so I was unexpectedly surprised by the semi-cookie consistency, but this didn't detract from the deliciousness at all! The cupcake was like a Hostess cupcake, but way better! I also order a brown suga' latte that was lightly sweetened, had the perfect hint of brown sugar, and perfectly coffee-ed. The service was a bit slow on the coffee, but it was 30 minutes to closing time and they had a steady inflow of customers, so I totally understand the justified wait. Not to mention, the wait was more than worth it. #newfavoritedessertdestination!"}
{"text":"I didn't have a great experience here, but I like the concept and the menu and I will try it again if I am in the area. I ordered a raw \"pasta\" salad - I don't remember the name, but it had spiraled zucchini and other veggies and seeds. It was good and fresh. The customer service was just a little weird. I was the only customer there around lunch time and there seemed to only be one person working. She wasn't friendly or helpful at all and the place was messy, which I'd understand if they were busy, but they weren't and the waitress was really slow. I think she prepped my food too. I was a little concerned about sanitation, but like I said the food was good. Have you ever been to a restaurant and wanted to take the food and eat it in your car instead of sitting inside at a table? It was awkward like that. Please, vegans, don't be weird and give us all a bad name."}
{"text":"Great food, try the nachos! Yes a little pricey, and I get the comments on bitter, but then again they are not adding sugars and creams to hide the flavors, and to be honest I will always pay for good food."}
{"text":"Nice environment! The people are very inviting. A wonderful alternative to the regular options available."}
{"text":"The smell can be a bit overwhelming if you're not use to juicing. I was a bit overwhelmed when I first walked in. There is a lot going on, but it's all inviting once you take it all in. There are two comfortable sitting areas. There is also a loaner library. Bring a book that you want to trade out. There is art for sale on the majority of the walls. The juice is a bit overpriced, but that's to be expected. I got a Green Machine. It was flavorful with a pleasant crisp aftertaste. I enjoyed it. I didn't use the wifi, but I plan on going back. The service was quick and lounging felt welcomed."}
{"text":"Worst thing about this place is that it's 20+ miles from my home.  Wish they were in North Scottsdale :)

Food is amazing.  They're really magicians with the various veggie products they use.  Presentations of plates is excellent.  Portions are large.  The place is nothing to look at and not a lot of seating but sure worth going for some terrific vegetarian and vegan food.  They're moving soon and will be a little further north but they need to move another 20 miles for this to be one of my regular haunts for lunch and dinner.

YUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Do not eat at 24 Carrots.  The food was tasteless and way over priced.  We had breakfasf with veggies and scrambled tofu.  There was a tiny bit of flavor in the veggies and the rest was awful.  Even the strawberries were bad.  Choose any other place.  It would be so easy to add some flavor but there was none.  The bread was so dry it broke into pieces when we spread the jam on it."}
{"text":"We had heard about 24 carrots and had wanted to try it for a short while. Heard lots of good things. So we hit our Saturday morning boot camp workout, went by the farmers market for a little bit, and worked up an appetite. Upon arriving we were greeted by a pretty little bed of flowers out front and as we walk in it became evident to me that this establishment supports local fresh Growers and makes it their mission to have a very welcoming atmosphere for anyone to enjoy and an abundant menu that can cater to just about anyone's taste buds. My mother loved the masala chai, and she has been making her own fresh masala Chai at home for about 40 years!!! I had a coffee and it was pretty decent. I ate the Arizona Bowl with cauliflower and was very pleasantly surprised by the way that the Apple soyrizo hash mixes with the garlic aioli and all the veggies and black beans. I eat meat two or three days every week and I enjoyed this meal so much more than most meat dishes! You can taste the quality in the all fresh ingredients!  I will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"This place has very friendly service and a wide selection of vegan food including several raw vegan options.  I've had all the raw vegan entrees and they are all good."}
{"text":"I'm not a Vegetarian or a Vegan, but this place is delicious, fresh, and gets local produce for their products. 

My favorite is the Voodoo Cooler. Apple, Grape, Cucumber, Celery, Carrot, Beet, Lime, and secret ingredient . . . Dragon Sauce! Sinus drain much? 

Also, their Vegan cupcakes are pretty kickass! 24 Carrots sponsored Phoenix's Take Back The Night Rally and March this past March, and our volunteer crew was able to sample mini versions of them. 

Give this place a go!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times. I enjoyed the DanDan noodle bowl. Also we tried the quesadilla w walnut meat. Walnuts are just too bitter to make the dish edible.also the tacos use walnut meat, bitter again. Not edible. They need a way to tone down the bitterness. Try soaking in milk. Then squeeze excess liquid.this has worked for me in past to tone down bitter product.  Also the spring rolls were dry inside, good variety of veg lots if carrots,  but adding cucumber would bring moisture making it more enjoyable. I had the Vampiro juice w red beets it was great. Next visit they used golden beets. Did not like the flavor. It just didnt work for me..However breakfast is tasty..pancakes were soo good. And my Gardener scramble was delicious! Love the smoky taste of the tofu strips.
I will return  get my go to DanDan noodle bowl. The tofu , noodles and zucchini noodles worked well together  and just the right amount of spice. Topping it off w peanuts was perfect! The place is clean with a patio  and a really cozy corner area with couch and toys for the kiddos. I have to mention the desserts , Fantastic! Gluten free and raw offerings make it guilt free :)"}
{"text":"Yum! Love their juices & smoothies. No artificial Jamba crap here. Real fruits & veggies, real fruit juice and the way they make their smoothies thick is to add frozen fruit instead of ice. The secret.

Their menu changes weekly, so that can be a good thing, but alas it means you can't get the same thing twice. Their raw sushi one week may be outstanding, the next week just okay. I've also had their quesadilla, which has also varied in quality. Hopefully they will at some point settle on a few fixed entrees the way Green has. I don't want to stifle the cook's creativity, but I also want a meal I can depend on to be delicious.

Love the new space. Congrats on the upgrade!"}
{"text":"This place has such delicious foods. They are fresh, healthy and I wish there was a location in CA. I love their smoothies and the fact that the have other milk options such as almond and rice, is just wonderful. I got the spring rolls today...delish! I eat here every time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Delicious vegan and vegetarian food. By no means am I either one, but I love vegetables. I had the spicy almond cheese stuffed peppers and the hummus appetizer. Both were amazing, also the pita bread they use is some of the best I have ever had. Plus I love how they get  their ingredients fresh from local sources."}
{"text":"Fresh, healthy, and vegan are the key words here at 24 Carrots. Prices here are a little high, but you're paying a premium for the quality and freshness of the food they serve.

We came here on a Saturday afternoon, and the restaurant was bustling with patrons eating tasty brunches. Remembering how empty the previous restaurant, Efe's Turkish Cuisine used to be, it's a welcome change to see a steady stream of customers in this space!

The menu is strictly vegan, and they offer options such as faux burgers made with beet, tofu as egg substitutes, and apple chorizo hash. I decided on the breakfast burrito ($9.75) to go.

Our order was neatly packaged and placed in a nice white shopping bag with utensils and napkins. When we got home, I opened up my to go container to see something that looked more like a breakfast \"wrap\" than a burrito. There were multiple layers of spinach tortilla/wrap holding the ingredients together, and there were a plethora of crisp, leafy greens in the wrap, along with other ingredients such as apple chorizo, scrambled tofu, and garlic sauce. The flavor was fresh, spicy, and an interesting balance of savory and sweet.

My husband got the Arizona bowl, which looked more like a hearty salad rather than a breakfast meal. Despite him wanting to come here specifically, I guess the idea of a vegan breakfast didn't appeal to him after thinking about it, since he promptly cooked up some eggs and bacon and mixed them in with his bowl when we got home!

They also offer smoothies and fruit drinks, which I'd like to try some day. 

If you're vegan, vegetarian, or just looking for a healthy meal, 24 Carrots is the place to be."}
{"text":"I have a lot of health issues and a very limited diet.  Trying to stay alkaline, and keeping raw, I have found many delectable options.  My first visit, I tried the raw chile rellano, then the raw coconut curry spring rolls which were PHENOMENAL!  I also got to try a raw vanilla cupcake with coconut strawberry frosting. This is currently my favorite raw food venue."}
{"text":"Enjoyed this place very much.  Excellent Vegan restaurant with passion to make great food.  You can see it in the ownership and how they operate.  I had the Hungry Tacos and hummus.  Will definitely come back - hard to find quality Vegan choices - especially where the owner and team are really thinking about new ways to make great healthy food.  Much appreciated!!"}
{"text":"The service was well meaning but odd. I add for a knofe to cut my veggie burger in half and they took away my burger with a bite out of it to the kitchen to cut for me. It came back only cut thru the top bun and burger but not the bottom bun (?)

Ok but the burger was naasty, I like spicy and hot but this was so hot it was inedible and the texture of the black bean burger was not good either. like mush, not crisped on the outside but like a pile of mashed beans on a bun.
I would not return."}
{"text":"It is certainly vegan and you pay extra for that - which is more than reasonable if you want  a place with multiple options with absolutely no animal products. I would eat here again but prices are a bit high for my blood, especially since there are a number of other options - bottom line - good food, just a bit high relative to the surrounding area."}
{"text":"Love this place! Everything is super fresh and the owner supports local growers. Its a nice place to just chill too."}
{"text":"The smoothies are great, especially the tropic thunder. Although they are extremely slow. Last week in particular waiting for my smoothie it was as though they cooked everyone's food before they could make my smoothie, it was nearly 10 minute wait for something so simple. 

My visit yesterday was better, still a little on the slow side. If you want a good healthy juice or smoothie come here just set some time aside."}
{"text":"Finding good vegan restaurants in Arizona can be really challenging but 24 carrots does a decent job. There are super reasonably priced and the staff is very friendly. I had the southwest wrap and my cousin had the Arizona bowl both were pretty bland and needed more seasoning. We did try their juices and smoothies though which were super good! I'm used to vegan restaurants in Portland which are both abundant and delicious, but I would definitely give 24 carrots another try."}
{"text":"I've been so curious to come here for the longest time and I am so happy I finally did. Wish I would have visited this place much sooner. I ordered the Arizona bowl, the Kapi coffee, and a raw pumpkin cheesecake. The BF ordered the French toast and the Gardener Scramble- delicious as well. Loved it all. I felt so good about what I was eating and it came out surprisingly fast. The Kapi was so yummy. I'll be back here regularly."}
{"text":"Yes it's pricey and the service is a bit show.

But the collard wrap with side salad ($10) was very good and a decent portion.  And they have sriacha too!

I hope this place makes it but would advise some more reasonable priced options."}
{"text":"The Vegan Breakfast burrito is DELICIOUS!

Best vegan dish I've had in 6 months of eating Vegan.

So grateful for this place!!"}
{"text":"My entire family loves eating here! So healthy & delicious....my favorite is the Buffalo cauliflower wrap & a hummus plate...so so yummy! My 6 year old love their vegan cheezy noodles with fresh fruit. I love their water with various fruit & cucumber and the glasses in mini mason jars. Everyone there is super nice & helpful. A very chill atmosphere but you can tell they are passionate about good healthy food. So happy they are here in our community! Great job 24 Carrots!"}
{"text":"The juice was great. I had a large size of Berry Bom Pomp (or something like that..lol) and a Veggie Masala Burger. It was great and fresh. I paid about $20. It was quite pricy for a burger and a drink. I might go back if I really want to find a comfort food with a very comfort place without concern about the price. 

The environment was very cozy. They have quite lots of books and novels to read. You can sit and read the books in there with a hot coffee and cookies:). Hmm...very nice."}
{"text":"Our family has been vegan for a few months and we have tried most options in town, none of which have been very compelling.  We also like to cook so the best meals are typically home made.  

I wanted to hate this place since it's not close to home, but every single thing was lights out delicious.  We had this carrot ginger soup, raw tacos, nori wraps and Dan Dan noodles.  

Everything looked and tasted Amazeballs!

It was a bit pricey but I'm happy to pay more for high quality, fresh and flavorful. We felt full and nourished and will try something sweet to go. 

Lastly I read some other reviews that seemed very off put by the stoic demeanor of the cashier. I can see how polarizing his attitude might come off.  He wasn't what I'd call convivial.  I go to eat for the company I'm with, not the staff, so this was a non-issue for us. That said, a nice woman did come by and warmly asked if we enjoyed everything.  

This place is 24 Carrot Gold!"}
{"text":"I love any place that promotes healthy eating and this place is no exception. Their juices are delicious and the food is awesome for vegan style food. I have tried the kale rolls which are filled with some sweet almond paste and cabbage and carrots. Really excellent. I have also had the vegan tacos, but they were out of the usual \"meat\" so they substituted black bean burger and it was still great. Really great sauces they make here. The place is very homey and has a nice laid back feel and the owner, I think, is very nice and personable. The reason I cannot give it 5 stars is because the service was extremely slow. I do understand they were having problems the last time, but it was also slow the time before. It takes about 15 minutes to get a juice and it took about an hour for our food which came out in pieces. I unfortunately did not get my food until everyone was done eating theirs and my stepdad did not get his iced tea (no ice in it, by the way) until all of us were done eating. He was parched to say the least. I had to take mine to go and was pretty sad about it. I do completely understand the place was having problems, but taking an hour for an iced tea is kind of unacceptable and I think it is much appreciated if everyone gets their food at the same time so we can eat together. Please take my constructive criticism well and hear me out. I want to give this place 5 stars next time!
Thanks."}
{"text":"While the hummus plate was ok.  There were flies everywhere - including on the pastries that were laying out today.  Just sitting on the pastries and flying everywhere.  They wouldn't accommodate my friend who wanted her sandwich in a wrap instead - said it would be TWICE as much.  Not enough flavor in the wraps.  We will not be returning :("}
{"text":"I went to 24 carrots for lunch and opted for the southwest burrito. I was asked to pay 2$ for extra avocado, while the menu clearly states that its a 1$ extra, NOT 2$. Their website said that their menu is updated weekly. To this, the 24 carrot staff were rude and I got angry looks from the staff. When my food arrived, there was hardly any avocado in my burrito. I realized this after eating one half, and emptied the other half to verify my hunch. I've attached a picture of my half portion: an thin avocado piece no longer than an inch. They made me look like a fool for complaining for a $1, and paid me back in rude lunch experience. 

Moral of the story: don't complain for avocados here. I'm very unhappy with their customer service. I left my number for the manager to reach back to me, no calls yet.

New update: got a cauliflower wrap which was good, but offered stale smelling hummus as a side. On complaining Manager argued it's not stale and served it to 20 people. I'm scared to fall sick after consuming a bit of this stale food. I was offered a substitute, but manager didn't want to admit their mistakes, this is after paying 13$ for this meal. 

I would advice not to have food here, their quality has come down but prices are still freaking high."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. The recipes are very unique and taste delicious even if you aren't a vegan. The staff is pretty friendly, the atmosphere is laid back and comfortable. The prices are reasonable. Highly recommend to try. My favorite recipes are the enchiladas and chilaquiles."}
{"text":"Really happy to have a place like this in Tempe. I've tried the raw tacos, raw jalepeno poppers, and Arizona breakfast bowl, with cauliflower scramble. It was all delicious, fresh, and made with pride. They also have a wide assortment of juices and gluten free backed goods available. I've been visiting for a week and I've already been here twice and will soon go back."}
{"text":"I'm visiting from CA and wanted a good juice while I walked around the book store. I saw this place as I pulled into the parking lot. I got a berry up beat smoothie. The taste is really good. It taste fresh and natural. If you're vegan or vegetarian which I am not you would probably enjoy this place as well."}
{"text":"Went here for Sat lunch.  There are like 1000 chalkboards with illegible writing, and two different printed menus, pretty confusing.  We got about 7 dishes and shared.  I am not a vegan but like all kinds of food.

Some of the dishes are really good.  The dan-dan noodle bowl (sp?) and nachos are first rate.  Very good.   Some dishes were not good, did not like the veggie burger.  Most disappointing was the hummus, almost flavorless.  There is no excuse for bad hummus, especially at a vegan restaurant and especially considering how good some of their other dishes are.

Some commenters say it is pricey, but prices are typical for this type of place and there is much food prep for fresh ingredients.

My advice is for them to be more like in-and-out burger.  No, I don't mean serve meat, I mean have a simpler menu and concentrate on what they do well - some dishes are really good.  Oh yeah, and fix your hummus."}
{"text":"The thought of having gin(ger) and juice on a hot afternoon was comforting so I dashed into 24 Carrots Juice Bar & Cafe thinking that it would serve fresh juice. It does...sort of.

Sadly the flavor of juice I wanted, is not freshly made to order - whaaa? - it was previously extracted earlier in the day. Uh, no thanks, I'll pass on the juice that's been sitting around all day. 

Scoped out the pastries and asked about ingredients. Everything that looked appetizing to me was gluten-free. Um, no thanks, I'll pass. If I'm going to eat flour, then I want the dose of gluten that naturally comes with.

Wow, I actually felt awkward. Was I really going to leave empty handed? I turned to the door, I turned to the counter, I turned to the door again. I looked back at the cashier looking back at me to see me looking back at him to decide what I was going to do. 

What happened next I know not, but I believe a jedi mind trick was afoot because I was leaving with a big to go bag in hand.

1. Raw jalapeno poppers ($6) - pieces of bell pepper stuffed with spicy almond \"cheese\" and dried cranberries atop field greens.
Very tasty. The beginning of this meal was looking quite promising. I think there were four poppers but unfortunately the almond spread wasn't thick enough to stay in the pepper. As I bit, it dribbled all over my shirt and crotch. Mmmm spicy cheese crotch! Eating on the run is a messy business.

2. Zucchini Noodle salad ($9) - spiralized zucchini, veggies, and seed medley atop field greens with choice of tahini or balsamic dressing.
Well that zucchini wasn't the only thing spiraling because here's where the meal started to spiral downwards. I didn't see anything resembling a seed medley, and my request for tahini dressing went to no avail. Whatever I got tasted like vinaigrette. Not like. Not happy. So I was left with a beautiful salad of hard veggies that I was no longer interested in eating. 

3. Raw Tacos ($12.75) - cabbage cups, walnut meat, avocado, salsa, veggies, cashew cream, and comes with a side.
I wasn't given cabbage cups, I was given a couple of flat dehydrated rounds that were used as soft taco shells. They tasted like beans. If you like beans, this will probably be your thing. I DID NOT like it. Also, the walnut meat was a fail for me. From how it tasted, the nuts had been soaked and then mixed with something (not sure what). I would have rather been given plain raw walnuts. And to add insult to injury the avocado slice was badly bruised. The cook should have thrown it out! Not happy with that melange. 

4. Bountiful burger ($13) - butternut burger, spiced cranberry chutney, kale slaw, choice of bun or bed of greens, and comes with a side.
I was really looking forward to this butternut. I assumed it was butternut squash. Well you know what they say happens when you assume. I have no idea what part of the patty was butternut because all I could taste were beans. Again, if you like beans....this is your dish. The flavor was there, but the beans were a no go for me. 

So what started out promising turned into a depressing ending to a meal that could have been wonderful if only I was given the ingredients that I ass u me'd would have been available."}
{"text":"I love this place!! As someone who is gluten, dairy, soy and corn free, I can eat almost everything here. I've always been delighted at my dish and dessert. Very happy they moved to Tempe and therefore closer to where I live."}
{"text":"The concept is great! I love juice bars that serve food catered to vegetarians using local ingredients. Wish there were more of these types of restaurants/cafes in AZ. What I don't like is the 50 min wait for a simple sandwich and a burger that was on the list of the daily specials. I get it, you're slammed and everyone is getting an eclectic meal that requires specific ingredients. But you had 3 people serving smoothies upfront and who knows how many in the back making the meals. Seriously waiting nearly an hour for a meal and not getting the tortilla chips that I ordered with my meal is unacceptable. I was later told, I would get the tortilla chips shortly after my meal arrived at my table. 20 min later never got it. Didn't expect to since the owner never went back to get it. I had high hopes for this place. Guess I'll take my business to Pomegranate - at least the wait on the food isn't as long."}
{"text":"In order to get a full scope of what Sasha has to offer, you need to pop in to 24 Carrots at least 3 or 4 times because there are so  many amazing things to try, you cannot get it all in a visit!

Here are some of the major highlights: 

1. Every day they make a homemade soup from scratch, and every single day it is amazing. The mashed potato, split pea, tomato basil, tortilla, and beans and greens are all DELICIOUS!

2. The hummus is like out of this world good. It has an airy, fluffy quality to it and they will give you extra veggies instead of pita if you can't eat gluten.

3. Sasha takes emailed orders,  updates her specials on the FaceBook page daily, and regularly interacts with her customers online. 

4. The Food: Mediterranean Bean Salad, Chipotle Tofu Scrambler Tacos, Summer Fruit Crumbler, GF Pasta Salad, Veggie Marsala Burgers w/ Jalapeno Cilantro Pesto ... I could go on, and on, and on....


I'm so stoked that she listens to her customers and is extending hours, adding new menu items (BLT!!!), and considering doing delivery! 

Whether you are vegetarian, vegan, laden with food allergies, or a regular Joe schmo.... there is something delicious waiting for you at 24C!"}
{"text":"Love! Love! Love! I had the cauliflower wrap and my friend had the enchiladas. They were delicious! I feel so lucky finding a vegan option with a lot of variety. I thought the staff was friendly despite other reviews. Even the owner stopped by to check in with us. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I were out photographing a wedding and we had time between the salon and getting ready at the hotel to get lunch. We found this hipster joint (which was right across the street from the salon) and said we had to try it. I had the breakfast burrito. A.Maze.Ing. So good. I can't wait to go back and then get to try something different from their menu!"}
{"text":"Interesting place. I'm not a vegetarian but went anyway. Pretty eclectic variety and was actually pretty tasty.  Juice drinks were also good and comparably priced to jamba juice. Plenty of space for a private conversation and a small patio outside."}
{"text":"This place right here is great!!! I was in the Tempe area looking for a bite to eat. I opened up Yelp and found this gem waiting for me to give their food a try. I walked in looked over the menu of great option and decided to go with the Buffalo Wrap.  Let's just say this wrap was everything I needed in my life. It was sooooooo good!!!!! I will defiantly be recommending this place to my friends."}
{"text":"Excellent vegan dining. Several raw options, smoothies, bowls, and treats. Interesting choice of tofu or cauliflower scrambles."}
{"text":"This place makes me HAPPY! The food is amazing, the staff are wonderful-especially the owner and the atmosphere is great! I recently bought a photograph that was displayed! One stop!! :)"}
{"text":"I was excited when I found hat the location us not too far from me, because I have been wanting to try it for a long time. 
My first visit was not very positive. I ordered the tacos but asked to hold the jalapenos, because I don't like my food too spicey. I asked to keep some chipotle in, because I like some spice. 
As I waited for my food - and I waited a long time - I noticed that the water was empty and asked the gentleman who took my order to refill it. 
Eventually my food arrived (at that time I asked for water for a third time; I had asked again while I was waiting for my food). I did not look at my watch, but it took a long time! 
The tacos had good flavor but no spices at all. That was very disappointing, because I had asked for milder spices, not to leave them off completely. 
In the end, the water was finally refilled as I got ready to leave. 
The second time I ate there, I tried the portabello sandwich. It was drenched in sauce and I was unable to even taste the portabello. Big fail! But the service was better this time. Also, when I brought up the issue with the sauce to the gentleman at the register, he offered me a free smoothie at my next visit. That was very nice.
The third time is the charme, right?  I ordered the beet burger. It was not bad, even though I had expected more beet flavor. 
All in all, I like this place. The fact that they use good quality ingredients and support local farmers is the main reason I will always go back there, but the gender neutral restrooms are a close second. It always looks clean and friendly when you walk in the door."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Beautiful atmosphere. This is the place! One of my absolute favorite places to eat. The food is fresh and real! Top items: raw tacos - delish, I order it every time, walnut \"meat\" and a great raw taco shell I would eat this everyday. Mac and trees - yummy, creamy, noodely. Spinach Artichoke dip appetizer - their vegan cheese is so on point not to mention it comes with lots of dippers. The Blt and breakfast  burrito are awesome and I highly suggest checking out their weekly specials its always changing. They have a dessert counter which includes some very yum and unique sweet treats made in house. They not only do vegan but also cater to other allergens such as gluten and soy free. The people are so friendly happy and chill. The fresh flowers and art is refreshing and lively. Will impress not just veggie heads (ask my dad lol)."}
{"text":"First off, you have to have patience and keep in mind that they make their food and drinks fresh. I absolutely loved my first experience there. I ordered the Arizona Bowl and the Pb&b. I didn't even mind the wait because I was fascinated by the cute seating area they have with their collection of books and board games you can play. It's so cute, I want to sit in there all day. They're also extremely nice! When I got home and took the first bite of my food, I then scarfed it all down and was sad to see it gone. It was sooooo good. I am not even vegan, but i want to start eating much more vegan food. They make it so easy and enjoyable to eat healthy. They definitely got another returning customer."}
{"text":"What a great place! Sasha and her staff are great people who were more than welcoming! We were in town on vacation checking out the area and they helped to make a great impression. They even occupied our son so we could eat! It was amazing. Chandler has really friendly, wonderful people and this place is a perfect example of that. I cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"First off, I would have rated this more of a 3.5 star, but my burrito was so tasty, I bumped them up to 4 stars! I loved the ambiance of this restaurant, and the food from the one breakfast burrito of scrambled tofu and veggies was so delicious, I would have loved to give them a higher rating.  The friendliness of the staff person taking the order was not mean or rude or anything, just lacking that friendly touch.  He didn't seem very enthusiastic.  Then the wait time took forever, it seemed.  Anyways, I went back on a different day to try out some of their sweet treats that were displayed in a case.  I figured since you just have to point and pay, it would be worth the drive.  It was!"}
{"text":"This is an all vegan restaurant, which is very appealing to me since I associate myself, more and more lately, as vegan. Plus I don't eat any dairy products so it's nice to have good, tasty, and fulfilling meals that I know won't upset my tummy! 

Just a heads up, this place is a little pricey! For an entree and dessert for one, I got a total of around $17! But they really do make delicious food that doesn't taste \"averagely vegan\" in the least, so I say it's worth it every once and a while! 

Tonight, I had the Southwest Wrap and a lavender cookie sandwich with strawberry filling. The wrap was a little powerful in its cilantro dressing, which kind of overpowered the dish, unfortunately. Toward the end, I just started scraping off the excess filling and just enjoyed the flavor of the homemade, toasty wrap! The dessert took the cake (pun intended?!) for me! The lavender cookie was much like a scone, with biscuity characteristics, and the strawberry filling was sweetly welcomed. The two together paired very nicely.

All in all, of course I will be back! They do have the best vegan dishes on this side of town, by far. They also offer raw too, which is rare and very appreciated. Try the Raw Tacos! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place has some good stuff! The jalapeño poppers are my favorite. They have some delicious juices and smoothies, but they are SO expensive. I know some juices contain some expensive ingredients and that's fine, but these are all too much. Even the smoothies with basic ingredients (like orange, banana, strawberry, etc) are $6+. This is not for a large cup either. I would come here much more for juice/smoothies if they didn't cost as much as my entrée."}
{"text":"There's not a lot of places like this (vegan, gluten-free friendly, health conscious, organic) in Phoenix, although they are getting better! However, it's still no California when it comes to accommodating to the varying health preferences. 

Honesty if you're in Phoenix and you've got dietary preferences or restrictions (gf, vegan), you're better off going to a Chipotle. Don't come here! Disappointed in the portion size, the wait and overall experience here. The atmosphere is deceivingly \"come one, come all\" but there's a weird aloof nature in the staff. A simple hummus plate I ordered took twenty minutes while the patrons who ordered after me got their food delivered before me. The wait was not worth it. The chips that came with it came to a grand total of maybe five? The hummus was weird, tasteless mush. Seriously, go to chipotle, order a burrito bowl with rice, or get some corn tortillas instead of flour, get beans and veggies instead at a generous portion size, and enjoy the pleasant, quick, efficient nature of the staff. Don't come here unless you want to overpay for poor service, and food that isn't worth the bill."}
{"text":"Sasha and 24 Carrots are fantastic! The best smoothies anywhere, and without all the junk and fillers you find elsewhere. \"Mango Overboard\" is simply the most delicious drink I've ever had.

Great breakfast and lunch options, both vegan and vegetarian. All incredibly good, and at prices that belie the quality of the ingredients and care in preparation.

It pains me to see folks walking past 24 Carrots to patronize the subway next door, especially since I know a percentage of these folks are doing so because they perceive it to be a \"healthy\" choice. STOP THE MADNESS! STOP AT 24 CARROTS!!!"}
{"text":"The raw nori rolls were amazing, light in weight but full of flavor.

The raw zoodles, covered in a delicious sauce, was a larger quantity of food yet still didn't leave you feeling heavy after eating.

I would recommend this place to family and friends as a must-try when visiting Phoenix/Tempe :)"}
{"text":"So damn good! This was my first visit here and I am absolutely in love with the place. It's beautiful and bright inside. The food is creative and delicious. The juice is as fresh as fresh can be. Prices are reasonable for a vegan joint, which sometimes can be more than I would wish to pay. The patio area is absolutely adorable. I want to recreate it at my house. There are fresh herbs outside that don't disappoint. You can smell the basil as walk past into the front door. Local ingredients are used whenever possible which gains major bonus with my husband and I. Another thing I really loved, there were people of all ages here. It's not just any \"hipster\" place. A lot of vegan places get a reputation as \"hipster.\" 24 Carrots did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"I'm not a vegan, nor do I ever eat healthy, but there is something very charming about 24 Carrots.

A lot of people think that eating healthy means sacrificing good flavor, but that is not the case with 24 Carrots. I'm a HUGE fan of the lemonade, and the variety of muffins that are available.

24C has free wi-fi which makes studying/working there palatable.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Some of the nicest peeps and the vibe of the entire spot is definitely an incentive to want to go again and again!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I just found 24 Carrots! I had heard... But not seen. They are still waiting for City of Tempe to approve sign. HURRY! People that eat well need to find you! A TRUE Vegan (not GF) kitchen. Spacious & open, with a fresh casual vibe. 

Great menu options that are based on local farmed foods for the week. Prices reflect quality - a little higher for healthy, fresh & local but worth it & fair! Portion sizes are great, food display, quality DELICIOUS!  I had a bowl of beet soup, 1/2 BLT with vegan tofu (non GMO) bacon & sunflower seed Tu-no salad!!! Lavender & Hibiscus tea... With tip $22 out the door but taking all the salad with me.

The owner comes out & met the crowd asked questions etc. I would give 5 stars but \"waitress\" sluggish & hum-dee-dum. It could use a good cleaning. Floors dirty, windows, fingerprints on glass cases. A hardworking server could be managing that. I'll be back for food!"}
{"text":"I had 24 Carrots a couple of other times after I wrote my first review & I do agree w/ some of the other reviews that it can definitely be a hit or miss. The first time I went it was great, I even had delicious dessert. The second time I went back it was for a pick up & everything was wonderful. The third time, today, I went back & I didn't like my smoothie, it was overly fruity, and I didn't like my raw cheesecake, it definitely was not up to my standards, but that's maybe b/c I make my own raw cheesecake & can be a little big of a harsher critic. The wait time was not bad, even though they were full. I still want to keep my 5 stars for this place because, again, they are vegan, support local, and use organic whenever possible.

Disclaimer: I do want to say that I could have modified the smoothie b/c I saw the ingredients prior to ordering, but I didn't. It being \"too fruity\" was definitely not on 24 Carrots :-)"}
{"text":"Food was very delicious.  I tried the burger and it was good.  I liked how i asked for.ketchup and they brought out freshly made ketchup.  Very very friendly staff.  Highly recommend it"}
{"text":"The food here is good: fresh, flavorful, and creative. Unfortunately, the coffee is weak. I got a soy latte which was largely milk. Whatever coffee was in it lacked flavor."}
{"text":"I love a great steak, medium rare but more rare than medium.  Eggs, can't live without.  I never thought I would like vegan food.

After eating here I have completely changed my mind.  The food is fresh and favorable.  The atmosphere is inviting.  The owner is pleasant, inviting and accommodating.

I had one of her cupcakes that had a raspberry on top, and a caprese sandwich.  Both were fantastic, and I just couldn't get enough.  

This is also just a simple business, started up by this woman, and I want to see it succeed.  With such quality food, it should be a hit.  :)"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite place to eat.  It takes a while after ordering - they make everything from scratch after you order and the kitchen is tiny.  But, they are planning a move to a much larger space soon....hurray!!  Sasha (the owner) is lovely - and a vegan genius.  Love this place.  Will love it even more when they move :)"}
{"text":"Great place. As with most of the juice bars around the valley drinks are kinda on the pricey side but what you are getting is definitely a healthy FRESH drink. Cannot vouch for food but menu is totally vegan and vegetarian friendly. Very cute place!!"}
{"text":"I had the Quinoa Salad today and it was great. Don't go if you are in a hurry. The service is relaxed like the atmosphere in the restaurant. I love finding fresh, gluten free food and was not disappointed."}
{"text":"Not a vegan, but a lover of good food. I am never disappointed and always amazed by the creative recipes. I also enjoy the pleasant atmosphere, great place to meet friends."}
{"text":"There seems to be a new group of employees behind the counter.  Customer service was much better, and my food came out fairly fast. I was happy with my grilled cheeze. Love the grilled red onions in it!

I hope they keep this bunch of people working today because it was a much better experience. 

I love the almond butter cookies!  A+"}
{"text":"I have never had an over-the-top and deliciously decadent breakfast that doesn't leave me feeling guilty, nauseated or sleepy afterwards.... until now.

Victory was delivered in the form of carrot cake pancakes. They are, for lack of better terminology, the bee's knees. The butterfly's shins. The wasp's ankles. You get the idea. Two fluffy pancakes studded with thick carrot ribbons, spices, and a delicious dose of sweetness independent of the maple syrup and fresh fruit they were served with. These are better than carrot cake... and I don't consider too many things in this world better than carrot cake.

On a very mildly unpleasant note, one cake was slightly undercooked in the middle. However, I have no fear of vegan pancake batter and proceeded to shove the entire thing in my mouth anyway. I washed that down with a \"field of greens\" juice (it tastes like it has the power to cure hundreds of ailments), and deemed myself full and satisfied.

Then, I noticed a little sliver of pie sitting in the fridge. Just a sad, single sliver. I had to inquire.. it looked so lonesome. Turns out it was chocolate caramel turtle pie. Vegan, raw, gluten-free, chocolate caramel turtle pie with a nut crust, salted caramel sauce, pepitas and pecans on top. I don't need to explain what happened next, just know that it was beautiful. Worth every one of the 650 pennies I shelled out for it.

It's been seven hours since I've eaten and I'm still not hungry. With the quality ingredients that 24 Carrots puts into all their dishes, it's no surprise that juice, two pancakes and half a slice of pie has sustained me until dinnertime. Oh, 24 Carrots, your wholesome goodness will surely lure me in again soon."}
{"text":"If you're looking for healthy, fresh and delicious vegan and/or raw options, look no further than 24 Carrots.

My first visit here was on Mother's Day of this year. I got a naked breakfast burrito, sans vegan cheese. It was perfectly seasoned and I was so pleasantly surprised by how fresh the veggies tasted.  The breakfast burrito comes with bacon, but my bowl was lacking the veggie bacon. However, I didn't mention the snafu. 
My DD ordered Banana Foster pancakes and she let me taste them. They were... interesting? They had a weird consistency; not pancake-y at all. We wondered if maybe they were gluten-free? But again, we didn't ask. The service was good, and I love that we were given our own personal water pitcher. 

I finally went back to try some of the lunch items that I'd been eye-balling for months.

Smokey BLT club (no T): I got mine with a side of chips and salsa. Very tasty and flavorful, although I am not a fan of their veggie bacon. It's not firm or crunchy enough for my liking. And I didn't like the salsa; it's very tomato-y, and I don't like tomatoes (hence my holding the \"T\" from the BLT). The aioli sauce on the sandwich was bomb though.

Buffalo Cauliflower wrap: I got mine extra spicy, no celery or carrots, but with a side of carrots and hummus. OMG. Let me tell you... Ask and ye shall receive. *waves church fan* That Sriracha was KICKING! I needed the earth and the wind to calm that fire! It was, however, amazingly delicious. Sometimes, a dish is just all heat, and no flavor. But no. The flavor was definitely present, along with that heat. I like hot and spicy foods, so the watering eyes, burning buds, and duck lips trying to such in the air flow to cool my mouth was all good times for me. For kicks, I'll try it with the normal spice level next time to see how I like it. Excellent dish!


Desserts:

Puddin Pear tart. It was tasty, but not worth the $5.50 they charge for the tiny slither they give you.

Black Forest Cake: Yes! Moist, decadent chocolate cake, with a sweet and creamy icing on top and in the middle, topped with a cherry. Divine! Definitely worth the $6.25.


Lots of smoothie options (I've never tried any of them). 100% vegan, lots of organic and raw options for foods and desserts. Food is always fresh and it's filling, yet light. They support local farms and businesses.  The owner likes to switch up the menu. I like this concept. I keep checking their Facebook page to see when they'll re-introduce the meatloaf that I want so badly to try. 

A solid 4.5, but I think some things are over priced, and I don't like the fact that there is still no overhead signage. If you don't know where you're going, it's a pain trying to find it.   Oh, and the hours on here are currently wrong. They are currently open 8am-7pm, Tue-Sat, and 8am-2pm on Sundays; closed Mondays. Not sure if the hours will change come winter, so it's best to call ahead to double check."}
{"text":"The aprons the staff wear look like they have never been washed...I'm not sure how clean or well run this establishment is...hmmm.  I also ordered two smoothies and they ran out of the proper size cups, so my large smoothie went into two small cups; a bit annoying. I also the prices to be expensive."}
{"text":"The prices here are pretty outrageous.  Personally, I would rather make my own smoothie out of ingredients that I choose.  This way I know what's in them.  Much cheaper too.  I suppose if you're a rich businessman traveling the world then you could afford this place but otherwise I'd say just buy a nutriblast and make your own smoothie at home and save your money.  Also, those corn straws they have break and don't work."}
{"text":"This place lacks in customer service. The BBQ burger my husband ordered was tiny. They were stingy about the chips they gave that came with said $12 burger. Burger was dry and crumbly and not worth the price. My Buddha bowl was tasty but way too oily. I'm a vegan and love trying vegan/vegetarian places. 24 Carrots is not a repeat for me."}
{"text":"Fresh juice - so fresh & crisp! Great sandwiches with amazing bread. And the hummus - so yummy with carrots! Loved the vegan BLT - love love love!!!

Great service - very friendly and answered all of our questions. Also loved the water with fruit. Will most definitely be headed back to 24 Carrots again soon."}
{"text":"I'm pretty disappointed in myself for not reviewing 24 Carrots. 
Every time I've gone, I've had the best service! The employees already know my name, they make suggestions from the menu, and make sure you're happy.
They like to experiment in the kitchen (as opposed to me, in the bedroom) and will bring out things they are working on. Beet Balls. Cake Balls. Yeah, they make a lot of balls. Score!
The last time I went, I had the grilled cheese. To die for!!!!
This is a vegetarian restaurant, with vegan options. You can get regular cheese if you want.
I always get a blueberry smoothie. Large. Yummy & good for the kidney!
Bring your laptop, as there is free wifi. There is no more perfect place to work. Believe me."}
{"text":"I have been obsessed with this place ever since they donated some items to a charity bake sale several weeks ago. The owner and folks that work there are great people. The food is great! I have yet to have something I don't love. Their salads made as wraps with hummus are great and there is something for me as a vegan and for my omnivorous husband. Their tortilla soup and lentil/kale soup are delicoius and every time I go in it smells like their delicious granola. I can't recommend them highly enough!"}
{"text":"My friend and I shared the watermelon pizza, jalapeno poppers, and the nachos.  The watermelon pizza was by far our favorite thing we ordered, even though it was so simple!  It was just watermelon topped with \"jalapeno nectar\" (I think agave syrup or honey or something), pistachios, and basil.  Although for $6, I might just try to recreate it at home.

The jalapeno poppers were not my favorite.  I know that vegan cheese can't taste like real cheese, but the texture on this \"cheese\" was too watery for me.

The nachos were pretty good.  I liked that the portion was HUGE (definitely share these) and that they put some inventive stuff on top - like shredded beets!  The flavor was a little lacking for me, especially in the beans.  I think it needed some salsa or hot sauce to spice it up.

We also both ordered juices.  I got the \"beet it\" juice and thought it was good and refreshing.  Not too bitter even though there was no added sugar.

Overall, love the decor and ambiance of this place.  The food is unusual and an adventure to try new things, so I'd definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So glad there's a local vegan place now!  Went in today for a late lunch (weekday around 3-ish) and had the place to myself!  It's a beautiful and spacious restaurant with local art for sale on the walls and fresh flowers on each table.  

They have a selection of teas, juices, smoothies, and sparkling water--don't expect a soda fountain here!  They also have a tempting dessert case filled with chocolates, cakes, and cupcakes.  Yum!  

I ordered the broccoli curry stir fry--peanut coconut rice noodles, bok choy, carrots, mushrooms, and broccoli served over a bed of fresh greens.  Great flavor, portion size, and not too pricey.  Filled me up...but still had room for dessert.  Tried the coconut lime cupcake which was really good!

Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place has great juice and smoothies. I wouldn't come here for food though, it's a little too expensive!"}
{"text":"What a shame that this place suffers because of the lousy service.

As a vegan from San Diego, I seek out local veg*n restaurants like I did this weekend in Phx. 24 Carrots is very close to where I stayed and I was excited to try the cauliflower breakfast burrito.

The gal taking our order was completely insouciant, barely verbal, and quite rude.
I decided against ordering a meal and instead settled on an almond milk latte and spicy chocolate cupcake.

After waiting 10 minutes and noticing no one working on the latte, I asked the gal about it. Apparently she had buried the order with all of the others so we had to wait even longer. No acknowledgement or apology.

The cupcake was dry and not much better than Whole Foods's vegan pastries. 
A $4 cupcake should be moist and tasty. 

What is really unfortunate is that I brought my mom, an omnivore who is curious to try vegan cuisine. She was so turned off by the negative experience that she will not be back. And she lives around the corner.

Take a cue from Nami, people. Improve your customer service and desserts."}
{"text":"I just love the food at this place. Great amazing healthy choices that taste good too. I love this new location. So big and open to the light."}
{"text":"\"Quite possibly the best food I have ever eaten.\"  That was the phrase that came out of my husbands mouth-and boy do I agree.  We are not vegans or vegetarians, just folks in search of whole foods that are made with healthy organic ingredients.  Based on the reviews, we tried it last Sunday and WOW.  I can't imagine anything tastier.  That is, until we went back on Friday.  We had the quesadillas and the pizza and hummus.  We were truly blown away.  Yes, it takes a while, but the food is MADE FROM HAND there on the spot.  Healthy, organic delicious ingredients!  I will wait for that ANY DAY!  We can't wait to go back.  Sasha changes her menu weekly based on what she finds at the local farmers markets. We will be back, and back, and back and back.  Did I mention we will be back?  :)  Do not miss out, try this place TOMORROW!!"}
{"text":"I'm not vegan or vegetarian, but I come to this place all the time.  The food is unbelievable - some of the most unique and delicious flavors you'll ever encounter.  Try the jalapeno poppers, any of their fresh juices, and the desserts!"}
{"text":"Today was my first time in, so I had some questions about the menu. The cashiers didn't seem to know much about the menu, claiming they hadn't tried it yet. (My advise as a former restaurant manager: fake it until you make it!) I ordered the peach smoothie which was really good! I'll definitely come back because there aren't many vegan-friendly restaurants but I'd really love to see the service improve!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place...the owner is very friendly, always chats with you and is always in a good mood.  The changing menu and specials are awesome. Great food and friendly people.  Nice place to hang out too if you just want to get on the wifi and surf with your smoothie."}
{"text":"I loved you the first time I visited a few weeks ago and now you disappoint me. You're out of almond butter which was the highlight for one of your breakfast selections and subbed peanut butter. Not the same!! The smoothies were just as good as the first time, but the fruit on my breakfast was a bit lackluster. I want to love you again and will try one more time hoping for the glory of that first time."}
{"text":"I am not vegan and this place is legit! I have driven past numerous times before venturing into this \"health\" spot. One day, after being sick for a few weeks, I thought I'd be adventurous and stop in for a fresh juice that might help fight the cold. Man was I in for a treat and it has since become a favorite spot of mine!

Still a skeptic, I thought to myself, \"I better try this place a few times before writing a review.\" Now that I've been several times, I feel like I can truly vouch for this place. I can't believe their meatless dishes are so delicious and flavorful! So far, I have tried the following:

-Hangry Tacos - Really good! Not the largest portion but still a good size. I was full after eating this dish. They looked dry and unappealing but don't let that discourage you from biting in and experiencing all the flavor!
-Raw Tree of Life Salad -- Huge!! Enough to split. So many interesting flavors. I prefer it with their vinaigrette over the tahini dressing.
-Portobello Cheese Steak Sandwich -- I was truly a skeptic of this dish and almost didn't try it. I am SO glad I did. It is by far my favorite dish and I can't wait to order it again.

Most of the juices I tried were primarily selected to help me get over a cold and were full of ginger, beets, carrots, and a few other Vitamin C packed fruits/veggies. If you want a sweet, yummy juice, the Blue Pom Bomb is really tasty. They can give you great recommendations on juices depending on exactly what you're looking for...

Which brings me to their service. I am so impressed. All the staff I encountered were super friendly and willing to answer any of my questions. They provided excellent recommendations and because of this, I have tried great dishes I wouldn't have selected on my own. 

I also like the layout of this place and it's always clean. They even have a cute, little, comfy corner nook with seating if you want to chill, read, or just hangout. It's also nice they offer both indoor and outdoor patio seating. 

Even if you're not a health nut, one day when you're feeling adventurous, give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance at this vegetarian/vegan restaurant! First saw it on Instagram while looking for healthy places to eat while traveling from Seattle to Tempe! The staff and owner were friendly and attentive and our two dishes were excellent!! Fairly priced at $10 or under and quality and amount of food is a great value! We are coming back for brunch!!"}
{"text":"What an awesome place. Ive been there a few times and most recently enjoyed the BBQ wrap with avocado which was amazing! It came with a side of hummus and sliced, fresh, cold, and juicy carrots (no dry baby carrot BS here) It was one of the best side dishes i've ever gotten at a vegan restaurant in terms of staying true to your roots and being healthy and it was really refreshing after working out. The only downside is that the food is kinda pricey for what you get - definitely a quality, not quantity kind of place."}
{"text":"I've been here twice at the new Guadalupe location.  The first time I came during lunch and ordered the voodoo cooler and a veggie burger.  I know the voodoo cooler had a mix of veggies, but only one I know for sure in there were beets because of the beautiful red color.  I've tried beets before, for some of my home-made juices, and I just can't get past that dirt taste.  This one was great tasting though.  Just the right amount of veggies and that dragon sauce gave it a great kick.  Unfortunately, I was really disappointed in my veggie burger, I thought it was tasteless and when it cooled down it became even worse.  I'm not really a big fan of dishes that pretend to be meat because I know I'm always expecting that burger taste when I know I won't be getting it.  So I'll blame myself for ordering that dish.

I went back again one morning and ordered a green juice and a quinoa and oatmeal dish.  I never thought of quinoa as a breakfast dish but it was really really good!  It was a hot meal garnished with strawberry slices and the flavor was amazing!  The green juice was also really good and the service is very pleasant.  I know I'll be back and sticking to dishes that do not pretend to be meat."}
{"text":"So, since my last visit with the awful lemonade, the owner actually contacted me through yelp to get me to try the Nimbu Pani one more time on the house, insisting it was made wrong. (AWESOME customer service!)

I went back for round two. She was right. MUUUUUUCHOOOOO better! It was actually sweet this time (she also informed me that she made sure all of her employees know how to make it properly too) They only thing that was a little weird were the whole cumin seeds in the drink....I just couldn't get past that. but, it was EXCELLENT as long as I didn't chew the seeds......

While I was there I ordered the soup of the day.....vegan (of course) potato leek soup......I hate to say it, but it really wasn't good. I didn't know it was a cold soup....had I known, I probably would have ordered something else (I think potatoes with aromatics are just mean to be eaten warm....it's just hard to stomache otherwise) This is the only reason I'm not changing my rating to 5 stars. However, I know they have other deslicous menu options that I will be happy to go back and have in the future. 

And THANKS for making me try the lemonade again!!!"}
