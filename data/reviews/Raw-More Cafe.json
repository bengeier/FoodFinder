{"text":"never try the smoothie. worst one i ever have with full of water, sense of yogurt and bit of berry."}
{"text":"Went to Raw Moré with my boyfriend to check it out and we were so impressed! John, the owner, was so nice and such a cool guy! We got a waffle with cheesecake gelato and it was excellent! The place is really cute and he also sells his own brand of protein bars. Can definitely see his passion and dedication shining through :)"}
{"text":"The service here is fantastic. John Whom I believe is the owner/manager was extremely friendly and actually seemed interested in our opinions about the gelato we were sampling. I've had items from almost every part of the menu I.e coffee, grilled panini and gelato. Everything was delicious and tasted fresh. A"}
{"text":"Great coffee, well rounded place nice snack bar even little health section. Best gelato, period! Pretty impressed."}
{"text":"This small cafe is not at the corner of the condo but rather to the side a little - you may not see this as you drive by, but thankfully they put out a sign in front.  Unfortunately, they do not have a great number of tables, about 4 tables and a few tall tables.  I would much prefer this to be a sit-down-with-a-book type of place but it appears to be more of a grab-your-drink-and-leave place.  I must say the gelato is great!  To begin with, I'm a big fan of gelato and desserts, so this was an easy one for me.  It's not super sweet and the fruity ones are really packing the flavour.  I tried the iced coffee here and for some reason it just doesn't taste right.  I'm not sure if it's the sweetener, but there's essentially no real coffee taste in it.   A little disappointing that the coffee in a cafe is not one of their best items.    To make up for this, the owners are very friendly and will chat with you.  They talked a bit with me about the gelato and you can tell they're genuinely passionate about it.  Great to see more local businesses, and I will definitely come by again to give it another shot."}
{"text":"Amazing gelato (cheese cake and berry together is legit), great customer service but best is the hours for sure!!  I hope people frequent this place more, we need more independent shops in Markham!"}
{"text":"Gelato is delicious and now that this small, family run café has gotten more established they have expanded their gelato selection to include flavorful fruits and the standard tiramisu, pistachio, chocolate, and others!  Very family friendly. Kind owners who will go out of their way for you (we have been invited in for gelato after-hours because the owners truly care about our late-night frozen treat consumption).  Great space. Great people. Great food."}
{"text":"-- My First Impression --  I was quite excited to have another cafe located in downtown Markham. The cafe was very spacious and was very bright. I was going to order a waffle and a matcha latte. Unfortunately, the store associate told me their waffle machine was not working and they didn't have matcha latte at the moment. I had to opt for my second choice and ordered a dessert crepe and regular latte instead.   -- Food and Drink --  1. Sweet Nutella Crepe with Seasonal Fruit + Gelato  - their crepe was very soft and chewy.The fruits were very fresh and sweet, especially the strawberries. The cafe was very generous in terms of the quantity. The crepe was filled with tons of fruits and they applied a lot of nutella in the crepe. The whipped cream melted before the crepe arrived my table which affected the overall presentation, but the crepe still looked very pretty and delicious. There were only four flavors of gelato for me to choose from (berries, coconut, chocolate and vanilla). The store associate suggested either chocolate or berries. I picked the berry flavor one and I loved it a lot! You could tell they made the sorbet in-house and it tasted so refreshing and sweet!   2. Medium latte - their coffee smelled very pleasant! There was latte art on the coffee! I would appreciate if they used glass cups instead of paper cups for dine-in customers.   -- Overall --  Since I was there during their soft opening, a lot of their menu items were not there. I love how their ingredients were very fresh. I am looking forward to go back to try their waffle and gelato!"}
{"text":"Overall - 4.0/5.0  New cafe serving up a mix of healthy smoothies, green juices, salad bowls, crepes, coffee, gelato and sandwiches.  The owners are very nice and they have done great job of tying in their existing business in health products with their café.   Had their tuna melt which tasted great and the ingredients were fresh. I would go for their wrap rather than the panini but that is just personal preference.  The latte was also fairly good with just the right amount of coffee bean aroma.  The protein smoothie was dense and packed with fruits along with their own protein base.  All their items are priced very well and in some cases cheaper than other places with better quality."}
{"text":"After an endless search of good crepe options in Markham, I saw Raw-more café's crepe photos.   We trekked over to downtown Markham.   We've never been to the new retail space in the condo complex but we were able to find underground parking.   The Cafe is a small locally owned store with a few tables.   The owner was super friendly.   We decided on the ham and cheese crepes.   I got my crepe with a side of spinach and olives seasoned with a touch of olive oil and dried basil or oregano.   The crepe was a good size for the value.   My only gripe was that my crepe was crunchy Vs my husband's, which he said tasted more buttery.   I liked that their ingredients ie spinach was fresh.   We were also treated to a cup of iced green tea, very refreshing.   We also got a chance to try a couple of the flavours of gelato.   My personal favourite was the wild berries and coconut.   Very rich and diary free!   The cheesecake gelato was quite creamy.     Overall, the prices was very reasonable for the food.   The owner is super friendly and asks for feedback on the Food.   I'd come back to try their sweet crepes and their cold pressed juice in the future.  I hope that there are more crepe options because that would definitely entice me to try their savory crepes again."}
{"text":"Dude manning the gelato was cool friendly and way too nice. Imma have to report him for being too nice. He let us try samples and the cheesecake and dark chocolate was jizzworthy. Excellent service, great gelato and nice view."}
{"text":"I am excited that another cafe has opened in the area.  There are several vegan-friendly options in the cafe.  Their prices are extremely reasonable (i.e. a smoothie with soy milk and vegan protein for only $3.65 inc. taxes).  The gelato is also very delicious with decent flavour selection."}
{"text":"This place is lit. I shared a medium gelato with a date - we got chocolate and wildberry. It tasted lit. Be warned, however, the gelato melts faster than the abdominal fat of a ketogenic marathon runner.  There's at least 8 benches right outside this place - 10/10 bench game strong.  Also, if you walk a bit further, there's 2 pokestops at the nearby park.  Gelato, benches, and pokestops make this place a guaranteed win."}
{"text":"Gelato fresh and fruity ! Tried the mango and berries sorbet - so good !!! Perfect for a summer night snack :) gotta come back to try the crepes next !"}
{"text":"I love that we get to see a city in the making. Located in downtown Markham (opposite the carousel parking lot) - a two minute walk from the cinemas, Raw More is a great little cafe with quick and friendly service, good prices, & tasteful treats and drinks. My fam and I ordered drinks - iced chai latte, matcha latte (hot), & black coffee along with a medium cheesecake gelato. The prices here are good - gelato cups in general (pretty much wherever you go) are small and, compared to other places, Raw More's prices are good (a medium cup is $3.25). The drinks are delicious and well-priced compared to other places too. I enjoyed my matcha latte and my brother's iced chai was yummy - not too sweet. The barista/owner also gave us complimentary cannoli which were so so so good. I was expecting them to be too sweet but I think it was the first time I really enjoyed cannoli. I definitely recommend checking out Raw More. They also have crepes which I have yet to try. I can see this place booming as downtown Markham continues to grow."}
{"text":"Go for gelato, but nothing else.   The Good: - Pistachio gelato - all natural ingredients, not sweet - Sweet crepe - whipped cream, red delicious apples, banana, nutella, strawberry, (opted out of caramel) room for improvement as there was the apple stem and strawberry leaf found.   The Bad:  - Service - took half an hour for everything to arrive, seems to have forgotten or not care - Utensils were dirty and sticky - Coffee and cappuccino. No taste. Do not expect any latte art or even espresso flavour, just milky flavourless coffee topped with bubbles, not even milk foam/froth. Could not even finish."}
{"text":"This place deserves a solid 4 star rating for food, only due to the limited crepe selection, and 5 stars for their customer service!  I stumbled in a few weeks ago, after the painful experience at Crepes on Main, with 2 of my girlfriend, each with a stroller. The server was attentive and considerate from the moment we walked in, and was courteous and friendly throughout. 2 of us ordered the savoury ham and cheese crepe, they added spinach for us for free! 1 had the sweet crepe- they were delicious, we were all stunned at how much we got for $5.50 when we paid at the cash register. They are pretty generous with their portions.   Their mini tiramisu cups are to die for (I am officially addicted!) Oh, and theirhomemade gelato is definitely worth a try! I had half vanilla and half chocolate. The vanilla was so aromatic and the chocolate was very rich! Neither was overly sweet. I am thrilled to have stumbled In this neighbourhood gem, I will visit again to sample other desserts!"}
{"text":"Excellent service. My family walked in to warm smiles and friendly greetings. As we explored our gelato options, we were all offered samples of the various flavours (which are homemade!). The cannoli was filled-to-order. The waffle was very reasonably priced. All in all, a great addition to downtown Markham!"}
{"text":"I came here looking to try the crepes, since I saw a ton of really nice photos on Instagram. I ended up getting the sweet crepe with a scoop of Tiramisu gelato on the side. As a self-proclaimed gelato lover, I will say, that they make dang good gelato! You can totally taste the difference in quality, and the owner who worked reiterated that all the ingredients are top quality from Italy. Definitely recommend the gelato! And not to mention, you can score yourself a scoop for as low as $2.50!"}
{"text":"I've tried their gelato in a large cup and since I was able to choose two flavors, I got chocolate and cheesecake. They were both really good. I will definitely go back when I'm craving gelato."}
{"text":"Pistachio & Strawberry Cheesecake Gelato ($2.75 for small, $3.25 for medium) All the gelato at this cafe are handmade, ingredients straight from Italy. They don't have a lot of flavors in house, but still a good variety. The owner is really friendly and encourages you to sample different flavors before choosing one. You also have the option to mix 2 flavors as well. The strawberry cheesecake gelato flavor was good but after eating it half way through it felt slightly on the sour end and tasted less cheesecakey. However, the pistachio flavor was BOMB! It's one of the best pistachio gelato I've had. The flavor was really rich. I personally think the small and medium sizes of the gelato are really similar - slightly expensive for its portion."}
{"text":"Found this cute little cafe near my mom's place so I thought I would give it a try.   I had a vegan Salad and my mom had their special crepe.  The hummus on the salad was delish mixed with olive oil.   The crepe was light and not too sweet which is great. I'm not a big sweet tooth.  Prices are great here too.  A must try for sure."}
{"text":"Finally try this cafe,  I try the home made gelato mango+ coconut +cheesecake and tiramisu. They are all not too sweet 4/5 star I would recommend to try mango and coconut I also order a brown sugar cinnamon crapes 4/5 stars the crapes itself is very fluffy, however the cinnamon didn't go well with the crape because it give you the sour after taste but other than that the crape was Made well To finish off I order there Frappé. Is nice to know you can choose the level of sweetness. To match the gelato and the crape, I choose medium sweetness level. It bring out the coffee favourite  Over all I do recommend to try this !!"}
