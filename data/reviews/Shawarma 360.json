{"text":"Fantastic food.  Friendly atmosphere.  I have been here many times and it is always consistent."}
{"text":"This shawarma is not authentic and not tasty. How can you prepare a shawarma sandwich and not have tahini as an option? The chicken was dry, overcooked and under seasoned. Overall underwhelming experience. Nice d√©cor inside, but the place is trying too hard. The bread was fresh and good, but not enough to carry the joint. Get back to the basics. That's my advice. Will not go back, much better options for mid east food in the area."}
{"text":"Ate here. Got the prime rib pita. It was delicous. All the condiments were delicous. Good prices. Very clean. Don't go for the dessert. Kindof stale. They should wrap each one to stay soft. Other than that it was awesome. Definitely a new go to place for us"}
{"text":"FIRST the man who served us was wearing flip flops, like really? Not only is that off putting for a food place but just unsafe for himself.. Nice people and clean seating area but if you peek around into the kitchen (which is right by the cash out) it's not very neat or cleanly. The food was different and simple but mediocre.  We got TWO fries with our order one for each sandwich but he put it in the same container together... rip off makes me think he did that to \"make it more convient\" but in actuality we got less then we paid for.  Sloppy shwarma roll and cold chicken?  Gross. Flip flops are for the beach bud."}
{"text":"Had it once a while back, didn't like it. Wouldn't recommend to try it or for myself go there again. Definitely tasted better shawarmas"}
{"text":"Order for delivery via Uber. Called the restaurant direct after I placed order to make a change. They were really friendly, helpful and accommodating. However, I just wasn't impressed with the Chicken Shawarma Wrap and my friend wasn't really happy with the Chicken Shawarma Plate. The pita bread for the wrap was tasty and baked fresh indeed, but so soft that it fell apart while eating it ...leaving my wrap a mess to eat. We both didn't enjoy the taste of the chicken and found it greasy. We will stick with Johnny's Shawarma down the road."}
{"text":"This place has alot of potential. I can see the owner has put in alot of work into the business.   Great food, fresh pita.   I will go there one more time to see if things sharpened up."}
{"text":"limited menu chicken wasn't very tasty and the drinks were a rip off.. overall its ok but there's something to be said about a store bought wrap vs fresh made.... i think i prefer the store bought versions...just overall very tasteless...  i'd like to try the beef plate next time and stay away from the McCains fries..garbage"}
{"text":"The good: Cool and chic ambience  Mouth watering \"graphics\" Awesome pita making machine which feels super fresh :) Neat idea for a dessert pita! S'mores!  The bad: Taste was average - why? I think it was an oversell  Price is high! Missing toppings like Parsley!  I overall enjoyed the few times I been to this place :)"}
{"text":"I enjoyed every single bite of this pita! They make a homemade pita right in front of you (white or whole wheat)! It's soft and delicious! I got everything in my chicken pita and all of the flavours mixed extremely well! I will go back for sure, especially because they use organic chicken and what looks like house made hot sauce! Overall great experience. The man behind the counter was kind and made sure he asked if I wanted anything added to the side. He also asked if it was my first time there, which it was! He made me feel very comfortable and put a smile on my face! I can't wait to bring my boyfriend here!"}
{"text":"I have tried this place twice, very clean staff is pleasant, the shawarma was excellent both times the chicken was juicy and flavourful, and today I had the prime rib that was truly the best shawarma I ever had! Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Stopped by there today for the first time. Menu was super simple . I was surprised when they started to make shawarma pita from scratch . Service was friendly  And my shawarma was the best I've ever had in the city . Price was great."}
{"text":"I had really high hopes for this place due to the reviews and even though the people there were nice, I had to give one star because the chicken shawarma wrap I ordered was really no good. The pita itself was decent (apparently they make it fresh and it was super soft.) However the chicken and everything inside was so dry I could hardly chew it. I probably won't ever come back and I do not recommend this place. It's the worst shawarma I've ever had."}
{"text":"Just awful. Chicken shwarma so bad I threw out half of it. Also I wanted lentil soup like most places have, but this restaurant does not offer it. Tried the falafel as well and was just over cooked and bland. Would not go here again ."}
{"text":"Came here and tried the chicken and lamb shawarma with my wife and mother-in-law. The place was well kept and the staff are really friendly. The pita wrap were tasty and delicious, the seasoned fries are a great addition (go for the combo and get 10% off each item, including the drink). Will come back again."}
{"text":"Amazing and very filling! Lovely staff, excellent service, located in a great and convenient area!"}
{"text":"Unexpectedly good shawarma place with freshly made pita bread which was soft and warm and super tasty.   I got the jerk chicken shawarma. I didn't really like the jerk spice they used and it was a bit too salty for my liking, so if I come here again I will probably get the regular shawarma. The portion sizes were very big and I liked the hot sauce they used. They wrap the pita on the outside instead of putting the meat inside the pita which means it falls apart easier than other shawarmas.   They also put beets in their hummus and garlic sauce which makes it pink so that's neat. Nice place for a quick lunch, but a little pricey for a shawarma."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch on weekday afternoon. Very delicious shawarma. I've tried akot of shwarmas in Scarborough and this is one of the better flavoured ones alrhough not the most stuffed or the biggest  First of all they make the pita fresh as you order. I tried both the chicken and lamb pita and the chicken had an awesome flavour and the lamb was very juicy. The seating inside is solid and it's nice and clean. Also tried the onion rings. Really good . They also have big moes burgers. Definitely worth going again."}
{"text":"Came here after work one evening because I was really craving a shawarma. To be honest a left quite disappointed. Here they use a different kind of bread which has more of Naan type flavour and it tasted very doughy.  I found that the bread overpowered most of the other ingredients and it felt like that's all I was tasting. On top of that the wrap was poorly put together and fell a part as I was eating it. The price was also on the high side just for a single wrap, I was not really a fan of this place and most likely won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Decided to try this little local place after seeing a profile in Toronto Life   I had the beef Shawarma and my wife had the chicken platter.    The portions were decent and both the beef and chicken were well cooked.  Chicken being one of those meats that can be rubbery if over cooked.     The chicken was complimented with a bed of rice and sides of hummus and hot sauce.  The sides balanced the meal.   I prefer beef and the meal was excellent.   I loved the pickled beets and the hot sauce was a great addition.  The wraps can be as loaded or plain as you want.    We will certainly be back."}
{"text":"The pita was not wrapped very well. All the filling was falling out everywhere. We were there around 8:30pm on a Saturday evening and there were only 2 workers serving a line of 6 people. It was 9:10pm when we got our food... Also, we've had it before a few days after it open and it was a much better experience. The pita was wrapped well, no mess. The flavours are there, the place just need to be managed better. Also, I suggest getting some straws and maybe ketchup for customers."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday evening and it was odd as their 'Open' LED light was not on, but I saw people inside so I went in.  Eventually one of the customers that came in afterwards brought up that their sign was not on that's why they hesitated on coming in. More people came in after us, and especially as soon as the sign was turned on.  Good big servings, but we only tried this place as we had a coupon for 25% off, I imagine paying full price would be on the expensive side.  Menu choices are limited.  But I like the place, it has a cool concept. The place is clean.  It was a good place to try one time, but won't be coming back as this place won't beat our shawarma go-to place by Warden and Lawrence.   Review 36 of 100"}
{"text":"Great place to eat and even better people. Bread is made fresh to order and their chicken is organic. Can't be beat"}
{"text":"A very classy and clean restaurant. The food is really good and the staff is nice and welcoming. By far the best and cleanest shawarma place I've been to. The way they make their food is unique and makes for a great new experience. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"This place is such a wonderful surprise. Just stopped for a quick bite and me and my girlfriend had the best sandwiches of our adult lives. They make the pitas fresh to order. I've never had a fresh pita and they put fresh spices on top. When you first walk in that's the first thing that hits you, the smell of fresh spices; cinnamon, cloves, allspice. Then on the wall they let you know that the meat is locally and organically sourced, as well as the produce. I had a classic chicken shawarma. The meat was moist with that delicious caramelized outside and I could taste all the individual spices they cook the meat with. My girlfriend had a falafel sandwich. When she bit into it we discovered it was a most beautiful green. The falafel was made fresh, there, with fresh ingredients. I've never tasted falafel like it. I live downtown but will definitely be making the trip back to this, clearly, family run business."}
{"text":"Very friendly service and a cool atmosphere as well.  Comfortable booths and modern vibes. First impression of this place is great, very welcoming. Delicious pitas"}
{"text":"Uhm wow! From the outside it doesn't seem like a shawarma place.. more of colours of an ice cream shop but as soon as you go in the smells remind you! The pita bread is made right in front of you- which is just awesome and the meat selection is standard. I had the jerk chicken  shawarma which was epic - definitely coming again!"}
{"text":"I stopped into Shawarma 360 on the weekend for a quick lunch. I saw the post on BlogTO and it looked great so I thought I would check it out!  I grabbed two Chicken Shawarma wraps, an order of fries and an order of Onion Rings. I also ended up with an order Falafel.   First off the place is very clean and has nice booths if you want to sit down and enjoy your meal.   All the pitas are pressed fresh and baked to order when you place your order. This is a big plus! The pita was nice and fresh and had a great little chew to it as you ate your wrap. It was very nice to have a soft fresh pita.   The chicken was fresh cut and lightly fried on the grill. The chicken was spiced perfectly and was nice and moist.  They off all the typical Shawarma toppings. I spoke with the owners and they told me everything is made fresh. All the sauces are homemade. The chicken is always fresh never frozen. The only issue I had with the wrap is that it's a tad on the smaller size.   The fries are fried to perfection and are seasoned with a nice spice to make you want more. The onions were also good. They are the thick cut variety and they give you plenty!  While waiting for my wraps to be ready the owner offered us a taste of the Falafels.  All I can say is WOW. Fried to crispy perfection and the inside was a fluffy filling that was not heavy at all. It was probably one of the best Falafel I have ever had! I had to grab an order of 6 to go. They come with hummus to dip.   Guys give Shawarma 360 a try you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Owners are very pleasant and friendly. From the moment you enter this place, you are certain to observe that they have put a lot of effort into creating a unique atmosphere,/ambience and experience compared to the standard Middle Eastern places. Like other Yelpers, I was amazed that they made the bread (pita) from scratch in front of you. We ordered a beef and chicken platter along with shawarmas and it was....well different.....in a good way, if you like a fusion of spices in your food. I tend to appreciate authentic or original versions of anything. I did however totally dig their chic decor, choice of famous personalities on their wall frames and overall vibe of this place."}
{"text":"Great ambiance! They make your pita right in front of you from scratch. Pretty good concept of you ask me! The guy servin was extremely nice and helpful in assisting me since it was my first time trying here! Great guy! Great food! What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"The food is made in front of you. Even the pita is baked in the spot! Great customer service too. Very friendly. I love this place."}
{"text":"Came here and tried the falafel wrap.  I do love their homemade pitas.  They're so chewy and soft that it gets addicting to eat it.  Also like all the cool art in the place as well. Would go back for the pitas."}
