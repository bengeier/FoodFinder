{"text":"We came to town on Valentine's Day to celebrate my youngest son's 21st b-day (yes, it's on V-Day).  Sadly, the drive from L.A. was more hellish than usual and we got to our condo so late that we skipped out on driving to Fremont.  (however, we did find Ellis Island nearby and enjoyed that for what it is! see my review)

I really wanted to make sure my sons went down to Fremont where I knew we'd end up in Bayou so we came Sunday after breakfast (Omelette House- divine!) .  I've been here before (of course, back in 2001 I think the daiquiris were about 1/3 the price!).  I really don't enjoy gambling, but I do like to sit at a REAL coin-op slot machine and pull the arm of the one-armed bandit with my own hand.  There is something very satisfying about plunking coins in and hearing your winnings clink into the tray.  A classic Vegas experience that is hard to come-by today. 

I truly hope they NEVER get rid of those machines!  

It's a friendly place and a must-visit stop on Fremont.  We had a blast and were only sorry that we couldn't come at night and get they whole \"Experience!\"   We will be back!

*note to self:  The drinks are stronger than they look.  
We got the hurricane, white Russian, and mud slide flavors and enjoyed them all.  I think I liked my son's white Russian best because it tasted like vanilla ice cream.  YUM!"}
{"text":"ELVIS!!! well the slot machines. i love this place. their machines pay out coins. you can put coins in them as well. i love the sound of cashing out and hearing the coins. they have raffles every half hour.i always have a great time here."}
{"text":"Greeted at the front entrance, handed free beads and a raffle ticket for a chance to win money. Great strong frozen drinks. I recommend mixing mud slid and banana tastes just like a frozen chocolate banana so yummy. Loved playing the old coin slots love the sounds and fun. Waitress around alot asking if you need a drink. Had a great time and recommend you stop and visit this place before they take this gem away from us."}
{"text":"Every time my husband and I visit (about twice a year) we ALWAYS stop here. It's a great hole-in-the-wall place right on Fremont Street. Cheap gaming and great drinks!  Great loud atmosphere to relax while passing through downtown."}
{"text":"Drinks are expensive but free pour!! One drink & your going to feel it lol. Plus the slot pump out coin still pretty cool."}
{"text":"Friendly cocktail waitress, great drinks. Real slots with coins, very satisfying. Penny slots, Nickels slots and quarter slots. Awesome fun."}
{"text":"Where to begin?..my wife and I spent 3 days on Fremont St and we stopped in at least twice daily. WHY? This casino has a great, fun,easygoing vibe with great music and the best, friendliest service ....before we even decided where we were going to play,we were given raffle tix and beads followed by my favorite question...\"cocktails?\"...we spent hours playing sunday and had a blast..when we returned, one of the cocktail waitresses(who worked the day before) asked me if I wanted my fav drink..and I was impressed by her memory...little things like that make a difference!...they have really great frozen drinks and you can use quarters!..old school fun with customer service that needs to be seen to be believed!...check this place out!"}
{"text":"Loved this place... It was my first time in Vegas this last weekend and I've always heard about the free drinks while you sit and gamble but what nobody told me is that you could be sitting there playing a game for an hour most places and not even SEE a cocktail waitress let alone order a drink. 

We were pleasantly surprised to stumble upon La Bayou where the casino is pretty small but there's 2 cocktail waitresses that came by before I was even done with my drinks...They just kept coming by... It was awesome... we stayed mostly for the liquor and had tons of fun!"}
{"text":"On a hunt to satisfy nostalgia in search of coin operated slot machines, we were pointed to La Bayou Casino. 

Leave all your expectations of a flashy, on the strip casino at the door. This place was probably the length of a trailer and the mood felt as such. If your nostalgia of old-school, mob run Vegas casino is a thick of smoky air, visions of retirees throwing away their Social Security checks, all the while hacking into the open air, then this is the place for you.

While we did indeed intended to play the coin slots, it began to be cumbersome when switching from one unlucky machine to the next to cash out your funds. Even more irritating was the fact that not all the betting denominations are the same, and not all machines will take particular coins. They do give you plastic buckets for the coins, even if they made you want to find the nearest hand sanitizer after handling them. We only put in $20 each and quickly realized why the rest of the casinos have adopted the printed ticket voucher system.

The cashier was very nice as were the employees that greeted you at the entrance. They'll give you free Mardi Gras beads when you walk in the door as well as a spin voucher for a chance to win up to $10,000.

Oh, and the drink service was nonexistent, granted we were only here for maybe 20 min."}
{"text":"This place is our go-to place for a cheap drinking night on Fremont! Get your beads and go straight to the back and order yourself the only drink you will need all night.. Note that I said need.. But the moment the last of it goes down into your warm happy self.. You think yay! Refills are half price..I'm thirsty.. I'll take another.. And suddenly that's the last thing your remember about your night! Seriously ... Drink it slow and make it last..keep your football and get a refill the next night.. Don't ever get the upgraded version with extra shots.. You'll be sorry! love the blonde who works in the back..she has been there for years and remembers me everytime we come to Vegas.."}
{"text":"I would like to say that the Margarita bar, they need to go back to school and know when people are drunk. I wear contacts, And when you add dry weather with smoke your eyes turn red. So this chick denied me of my drink and my friends because I looked like I couldn't stand & my eyes were blood shot. What the f$&@!? I was completely fine. My boyfriend was completely sober and said I was good. Managers, check your employees!!"}
{"text":"Bayou still has the coin operated slots! Mermaids has given theirs up sadly but at least this little Fremont find is holding on. 

Great gambling experience but Mermaids has the fun food across the road. 

I recommend going to both!"}
{"text":"Venue:  La Bayou Casino
 
Decor: New Orleanian (I think that's a word)

Service: Friendly

Environment: Compact, closed Knit

Food: N/A (although they had food, I can't speak on it)
 
Prices:  Cheap Gaming, Slots!!!
 
Debbie Downers:  Small venue
 
Conclusion: Come here for the powerful beverages as if on Bourbon Street.  I didn't see anything here that stook out like a sore thumb except that the venue itself is smaller than nearby.
 
Overall: C"}
{"text":"Probably the last casino that uses coins still. It's nice to hear the clinking and reminiscing about those plastic tubs for coins but I sorta like the connivence of having a paper ticket to carry around. Still it's a nice tiny hall to get your change purse out.

They give free samples of the drinks in the back. They put way more alcohol in the sample than what you actually get though. I had the pina colada and it has just enough to make me tipsy. But I'm a lightweight."}
{"text":"In the heart of Fremont is Le Bayou casino. It has a Cajun-Themed atmosphere with Mardi Gras beads and monster daiquiris. My favorite feature is slot machines that actually accept and pay nickels!! Hitting a jackpot is so much fun when coins actually fall out of the machine. I hit this place up every time I am in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"I love this little tucked away casino! It reminds me of old school Vegas complete with machines that dish out actual change. They only offer rolling rock, beer wise and I don't know how good their drinks are but there always seems like a line to get a frozen concoction. Everyone working here is pretty friendly and the slot machines are loose, we usually always walk out winners."}
{"text":"Rating for Daiquiries only, you won't win raffle or slots. Pictures of suspicious winner out front, winner looks homeless."}
{"text":"Pure ghetto.  They lure you in with the temptation of a raffle ticket for a cash drawing to take place \"any minute\".  So you come inside with your \"winning ticket\".  Nothing to do while waiting except select one of the few slot machines in this tiny joint and slide some cash in.  Then here comes the cocktail waitress.  Order is placed, and drink delivered.  Time for the tip.  Well, I always tip and did this time.  However another guy nearby wasn't going to tip, apparently.  So the waitress stands there for like 90 seconds after delivering the drink with her hand stuck out.....just standing there by this guy.   She refused to just walk away.  The guy finally says something like he'll take care of her next time around.  That really pisses her off and she spouts an obscene comment, then abruptly turns, walks away, and starts slamming things.  First time I've ever witnessed anything like that.

I guess this must be part of the Fremont Street Experience too !  ha ha"}
{"text":"Free beads.  Free ticket for entry in to a drawing (done every 30 minutes).  HUGE daiquiri selection for $16/$17 a piece (screw the football, go for the long haul), and for 2 or 3 bucks more get an extra few splashes of booze for the mix.  Coined games that feed out nickles with dirty grime lined buckets to collect the change in.  Small casino but proves to be a nice little trip for the beginnings of a night of debauchery."}
{"text":"Great little casino. Greeters at the door give you lucky Mardi Gras beads as you enter. The casino is small with only slot machines, real ones!  The ones that take coins and pay with coins!  The banging of quarters hitting the metal trays after hitting a jackpot. The buckets of quarters being carried to the cashier in the back to collect your payout. The walking away feeling like a winner because your fingers are covered in the oil of the machine after scooping your winnings into the buckets. That special feel of winning that was lost to the printed receipt is alive and well here!"}
{"text":"I really love this place. A seedy, smoky hole in the wall casino on the Fremont strip. Its easy to walk past, or just not think its your type of place, but it truly is a fun little part of old Vegas.  They still have coin slot machines which is the main perk, you almost forget that once upon a time there was a time when slot machines spit coins out at you when you won, instead of a silly piece of paper voucher.  It really adds to the experience. We ended up coming up on some money from our favorite slot machines (not gonna tell you cuz otherwise everyone will wanna play) 

The ladies at the daiquiri bar were super nice and friendly, offering any samples we wanted. We ended up going for some red bull and vodka in a football cup, its worth the money and isn't as sugary as those daiquiris, which albeit are delicious, but will do more harm than good in the end.

We even got our number called to pull the $10,000 slot machine! But only won $10. LOL! Regardless, I love this place and will be back on my next trip Vegas!"}
{"text":"I like getting my yard drinks here because from the moment you walk in they give you beads. Their yards and footballs are about $2 cheaper than the nearby bars. They have a good selection of choices and an extra shot is $2-3 dollars more but well worth it. Refills are $8. The drinks are strong!! The actual casino is pretty small."}
{"text":"Been here a few times with friends for cheap eats, drinks and beads. 

You come here to have a good time and be in and out in a flash. 

They have great daiquiris and free beads! 

There are no table games just slots. 

It's easy to get in and out of as its on Fremont. The staff are friendly and the crowd is fun. 

The lines do tend to get long as everything is cheap.

If you're in the Fremont Street Experience, you've got to stop by and enjoy a classic Downtown Casino. 

Note that they do close for a few hours so checkout their times. 

The machines in here are older but that doesn't mean they aren't fun. 

They do not have a players card, so play and don't expect a free meal or room lol.

Vegas Baby!"}
{"text":"Ghetto Fab... 

It's a tiny casino, no card tables, crammed full of people, waitresses are outgoing, drinks are filled super fast. I don't play slots, so I wonder why I always end up here??? hummmm, I think the free beads draw me in, and I always end up talking with the craziest people.. I've always had a good time coming here, this is my third time this year! Yes, it's pretty old, but hey it is in the old Vegas, if your expecting glitz and glam go to the strip and pay a lot more to be stuck in boring-ville."}
{"text":"What a terrible dump! And why haven't I been here before???

I skipped out on the mardi gras beads on my way in - have more than enough at home. I did, however, accept the coupon for the buck off the BIG daiquiri. BIG. As in 48 ounces!

I wasn't driving, was with a group of people I have no qualms trusting my life with and face it - sometimes 48 ounces of liquid \"I don't give a shit\" are just what ya need! And when I decided to pay homage to the \"I don't give a shit\" days of NOLA is when I started having a blast.

That - and the look on a friend's face when he cashed about $300 from the slot he was playing and it paid in nickels! Got used used to the paper ticket - having any coin drop is a throwback...but NICKELS? Wasn't even a nickel slot...so the look on his face was classic.

Yay - I will totally be back!"}
{"text":"La Bayou is a hidden treasure on Freemont St!! You can still play with coins and win with coins instead of a ticket. The football drinks are the best!! Whenever we go to Freemont street I always stop in for my beads, and a Brain Wrecker. At least I think that's what it's called. We haven't been back to Vegas since 2009, and I hope you still have those when we come back in February. One of the highlights of our trips to Freemont St!! See you again this winter."}
{"text":"I liked the LaBayou when they were open some management like Barbara, John were great they welcomed you by name. Others not so much since they closed I have more fun and win more money with out all the drama of unfriendly managers Neil mainly. I know the Golden Gate and they welcome and regular customers"}
{"text":"I love this place. The machines are fun and the coin aspect is a nice perk. The cocktail server is AWESOME! They are super quick and attentive! I always tip them well. You should too! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"This place is cool to drink and chill a bit. It's definitely worth it. The drinks are amazing. Ain't nothing like a nice place to chill once you get off work."}
{"text":"really cosy, real 1 armed bandits that shoot coins ! , greeted at the entrance with free necklace. Great free drinks! Experience Las Vegas how it used to be evrywhere. We had a few great evenings here! Love it !"}
{"text":"Go here! It is one of the last places on the strip using coins. It is super tiny but if you cash a 20 dollar bill into nickles you can plink away for hours. My sister and I were able to make a 20 last for 3 hours between the two of us and we probably had at least 15 drinks between the two of us in that time. Cheap cheap cheap. The staff is super friendly. It is my new favorite casino."}
{"text":"So sad this place is closing. Went a few weeks ago and had the best time. Their daiquiris are top notch and worth the money, they are very alcoholic and delicious. The best staff, everyone was so nice- and their slots were pretty loose. I won 25 dollars and my boyfriend won 40. We had a blast, and we are in our mid-20s! There is nothing like gambling with actual change and hearing it cash out! I hope they decide to do something great with this area- definitely a diamond in the rough!"}
{"text":"La Bayou deserves a 5/5 rating because you get what you pay for and considering the niche market that it goes after, it fits the bill quite perfectly. My largest criticism is really rather historical in nature and cannot be held against the current owners in the slightest. Allow me to explain: 

Make no mistake, La Bayou is a dive. A throwback to casinos from the seedy 1980's days of Las Vegas. Actual coins are heard throughout the tiny slot house clinging almost musically to the ear reminiscent of days gone by. When Benny Binion and Jackie Gaughan were in constant battles over who controlled Downtown and when a cheater had a back room and a tack hammer to look forward to if he got caught. Of course, La Bayou is strictly a slot house so no table games to worry about. The staff us minimal at best but work hard to manage the property. The cocktail waitresses are a pretty hard working and borderline overworked group of ladies as they seem to work both Mermaids across the street as well as La Bayou. Drinks served are strictly low shelf, well only, but you wouldn't expect much more. And they are served in tiny 6 ounce plastic cups, which once again, goes with the territory and you get what you pay for. 

One point I did want to address is that the cocktail waitresses are nothing if not aggressive. As soon as you walk in, before you even drop a twenty in a machine, a waitress is asking what you would like to drink. One major tip I would say to ANYONE is that you are prepared to tip the ladies for the beverage. The fact that it's a slot house doesn't matter in the slightest and don't even think of tipping one or two quarters. Though this casino may be a time capsule to 1982 doesn't mean that inflation hadn't occurred. Have cash or several quarters and tip the Vegas standard of $1 per drink. There. Tangent over. 

La Bayou was once known as Coin Castle. It was known as Coin Castle for the better part of 25 years from 1969 through 1996. Here is where we come to my one and only major criticism of the property: I totally respect that times change and the need to rebrand and stay relevant are integral to business success, but why La Bayou? Why not leave well enough alone and keep that glorious Coin Castle King atop the tiny little building. He looked a hell of a lot like King Friday from Mr. Roger's Neighborhood (with an oddly Asian eyeline) and he was literally an institution in Downtown Las Vegas. I do not hold this against the owners of course, but the nostalgia bug in me saddens me every time I go to the Neon Museum and see the once tall Coin Castle King that overlooked Fremont now on display in a museum instead of welcoming guests to a classic old Vegas throwback. 

The history of this tiny slot joint doesn't end there though. Predating the Coin Castle and the Monte Carlo Club, this site was once home to the very historical Northern Club. Mayme Stocker was the first woman ever to be granted a gaming license and she did so on the very land that the Bayou currently occupies (but not the same physical building, unfortunately). Nestled adjacent to the Golden Gate, the La Bayou is truly a throwback in every sense of the word. 

The owners of La Bayou also own Mermaids and the Girls of Glitter Gulch strip club. Mermaids and La Bayou are pretty much run by the same team I believe and the girls that give out the beads walk back and forth across Fremont constantly. 

La Bayou does not offer a restaurant but they do offer a simple change counter/cashier that cashed you out in the back and a bar that offers value priced daiquiris and mixed drinks in oversized glasses. I would like to see the daquiris offered complimentary to players (even if only served in the tiny plastic cups) but beggars can't be choosers. 

Overall, La Bayou is worth visiting because of the history alone. Because of the true throwback to 1970's and '80's Las Vegas. And because places like this are disappearing faster than you can say MGM Resorts International, and you definitely want to visit it before it and places like it all disappear and are remembered only in Travel Channel retrospectives. Grab a coin bucket, dig out those quarters from your couch cushions, and a pack of smokes and head out to Coin Castle.....er.....I mean La Bayou as soon as you can. And most importantly, don't take anything there too seriously. Just have a good time and enjoy the passage into old Vegas. Tell the Spirit of the Coin Castle King that I said hello."}
{"text":"The La Bayou Casino is unlike any other in Vegas. 

You have the females outside dressed in yellow/purple handing out beads and coupons to come inside. 

Once you walk in you are met by employees who want nothing more than to be there at that moment. Everyone is super helpful, knowledgeable and there is zero pressure at the tables. Even the people there betting are willing to help you. 

I dig Old School Vegas and thank you to the staff for making sure that happens. Next time I am in town I will make sure to stop by and play a little."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 5 stars because I've got a long story behind it.  To make it short, the yard long frozen drinks with the extra shot for a dollar caused me to get married on the fly. And actually the second one I had a WELL-POURED extra shot of Bacardi 151, almost filled up the entire bowl in the bottom of the yard long!!  The county almost wouldn't give us a marriage license!!  But that was nearly 7 years ago, and eveyrthing has worked out really well.  I do remember the place being very fun and crazy for a \"shotgun\" dive casino.  We'll go back next time we're in Vegas, not only for the memories, but alos because it was just plain fun here."}
{"text":"God this place is a DUMP!
But, it gets a second star for the amazing \"big ass drinks\"!"}
{"text":"They have the best slushy drinks here. Everytime I come to vegas I have to get one. I love the Pina colada but they have atleast 10 different flavors.  The price for a 48oz is $18 and if you keep the cup it's an $11 refill. I usually have one but they are so good especially on a hot Las Vegas day. You can also get an extra shot but it makes the drink watery and in my opinion a little too strobg and kills the drink. Upon entering you also get beads and a ticket to enter a raffle. It's a little hole in the wall casino but the drinks are worth it."}
{"text":"First of all, the place is a hole, and not in a good way. 

I wouldn't mind so much except I had an issue with the security guard who pinpointed me as \"trouble\" i suppose since it was Halloween and I was wearing a HAT that looked like a lion- it's a hat for CHILDREN. Perhaps I scared him, but he told me in order to remain in this establishment I'd have to remove my hat. 

I found this to be interesting since there were PLENTY of people inside of the casino wearing hats and not being asked to take theirs off. Many were in costume. Many were extremely shady looking, but he just passed by them without a second glance. 

Maybe he really dislikes lions. Either way, he pissed me off. 

Thanks to the cocktail waitress for the 2 free beers- she was pleasant at least."}
{"text":"This could be the smallest and funniest casino in Vegas. It's amazing! Located right on Freemont Street, this casino has it down to a science. 

1. As you walk in, you are immediately greeted by a women in a bright purple Mardi-Gras like jumpsuit holding beads. Before you enter, she chooses three beads for you (that just so happen to match your outfit) and puts them around your neck. Then she gives you a raffle ticket letting you know that the raffle happens every thirty minutes for the chance to win prizes. 

2. Next you step foot inside. Immediately you are welcomed by a cocktail waitress who offers you a drink. The drinks are complimentary as long as you gamble. 

*** Like I said, this is a teenie tiny casino with two walls of slot machines and one row in the middle. It's the old school type slot machine with quarters and the plastic tubs to put them in. 

3. As you gamble quarter slot machines and sip your free drink, beware because you might win and if you do, the staff will treat you like you won a million bucks (even though you just won $80 in the slot machine). They will also immediately hand you a business card so you remember where you were. And guess what? I did remember which is why I'm writing this review! 

4. During your time here you will get great service, free drinks, mardi gras beads and you might even leave with a prize. 

Now remember, this isn't a casino on the strip and it's pretty old and rundown. But it's cheesy in a great way and worth the experience. You'll leave feeling like a VIP with some great Mardi Gras beads and maybe even a tub full of change. So escape the craziness of the strip and check out Freemont Street. When you're there don't forget to stop into La Bayou Casino."}
{"text":"Owned and operated by the same people who own Mermaids. You can tell as soon as you walk in the door. No tables, nothing fancy, machines pay out in coins. This is what Mermaids USE TO BE. I guess they took their best staff and send them here. Really friendly, and the facilities were a lot cleaner than Mermaids. Next time I'm in town and skip my usual Mermaids trip and just come straight here."}
{"text":"This place is cramped and borderline gross, but it's hilarious! All coin machines, so you get to walk around with your little coin bucket. I won $40 on a machine, that was fun trying to keep the coins inside the spill tray - they kept wanting to bounce out lol. Yes the cocktail waitresses are crazy, yes the floors are gross and the drinks are expensive, yes the decorations are insane and backwoodsy, but it's all part of the fun. I think this ended up being one of our favorite spots surprisingly. All part of staying downtown lol."}
{"text":"Absolute dive casino, totally rickety and trashy! You are greeted at the door by hot pink, yellow and purple dressed New Orleans inspired flare and are given some beads as well! The clientele is dicey and suspect at best! Oh and the best is when I stepped out of the casino for a second to get some fresh air, the girl dressed in the flare said bye to me I walk back in 30 seconds later and again was ID'd after she just saw me leave (She Id'd me the first time in as well) after about 30 or so seconds to a minute of her trying to calculate my age I told her my age and she let me back in.... Classic!"}
{"text":"Love their slushy drinks. You pay 20 for the first one and then the refills are 10! Great deal!"}
{"text":"THE Fastest cocktail servers I saw on the strip or downtown. Maybe it's because it's small,  but I don't care... They were the best!  And the monopoly game was very generous to my husband as a bonus... The only place I'll gamble in downtown again... Extra perks: beads and free drawing every 30 minutes.  Frozen drinks were delicious as well and they ya sample em too!  Definitely worth checking it out"}
{"text":"I just LOVE this place! My boyfriend & I spent hours in here & he taught me how to play black jack while we won raffles & had drinks. Boy this sure is my favorite place on the strip!! The music was great too & it wasn't so packed & loud that you can't hear it like all of those other shit holes on the strip- this place will live on forever in my heart!!"}
{"text":"While on Fremont Street, I always have to visit La Bayou. One of the last places that uses coin machines, it's pretty fun. We were greeted quickly, given beads and discount coupons for one of their frozen concoctions that hit the high 40 oz. mark. If you like to walk around, I recommend sharing one of these tasty treats with a friend or two as they make them strong. If you get one of the bigger drinks (40 oz or more) you can get refills at a discount as well.

There are also drawings every hour for cash prizes which is kind of a nice bonus.

For good drinks, and a good time at a small but fun place, this is worth a try."}
{"text":"This is both the saddest as well as happiest place on earth.  It's old, pretty shabby inside with cocktail waitresses that seems rather glum. (The sad part).  But it has old time slot machines (that still spit out your winnings) and one particular one paid us $75 on a 75 cent pull. (The happy part).  Come here, enjoy the surroundings and the patrons it attracts, and make sure you grab a pail in the event you win!"}
{"text":"Let's be honest. Gigantic frozen daquari's are the draw, and they're worth it! also, REFILLS are around $8 but a fresh glass is twice as much, so make a few trips to make it more worthwhile =)"}
{"text":"Well i walked in here with a giant plastic boot full of whiskey and soda and i sat down at the slot machine and a girl came and gave me another free whiskey and soda anyway.
I like this one cuz its small and everybodys drunk and they play ok music and you can hear it.
Also you can smoke and the machines take actual coins and i won a raffle. Idk i dont usually write reviews about stuff but were driving home from vegas and im bored in the car but too tired to read my book."}
{"text":"Located on Fremont Street in Downtown Vegas.

This casino's still got quarters that actually fall out of the machines with buckets and all that! None of that ticket redemption hoopla.  It was pretty cool seeing these kinds of machines still, but kind of a pain in the ass at the same time because I've been spoiled with just redeeming tickets and not having to get all down and dirty to collect my money.

Tiny casino. Got just a few rows of slot machines but these slots did seem a bit looser than the ones on the Strip."}
{"text":"It is recession time, so we didn't get any free drinks as my friend promised, but still we stayed for a while on the slut machines. Like I'd always say invest, recover then leave. In the end I was tempted to try one of the drink-blends you see many walking with, and here I got my piña colada daiquiri for 14 (medium size).

People seem to love this place because of....beads! Very american thing I guess. You are given 1 free and the option with a raffle to win other \"exotic\" ones."}
{"text":"Located in Downtown Las Vegas on the Freemont Street Experience, this is a small slot machine only casino with a bar in the back that has quite a variety of frozen drinks in big souvenir glasses. Two very festively dressed women  stand outside handing out beads and entries to the hourly drawing for one thousand bucks, not bad, stop by get some beads and a chance at a grand! Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"It's a small dive casino in the downtown area. It is a shot gun style (almost like most dive bars) with Slots only. They have these women outside dressed in Mardi Gras colors handing out beads when you walk in. They also give you a raffle ticket for a drawing. Something like $10,000 or what not. IDK think anyone ever wins those. It's a little dingy on the inside...but go to the back they sell those HUGE drinks with lots of booze in them for pretty cheap. 

Be warned!! The bathrooms are something out of TJ Mexico and there are no tables to play cards on. 

meh. It's okay. I'm sure we will stumble into this place for one of those drinks again."}
{"text":"$1 Daiquiri's!

Would not consider this much of a casino but they do have a lot of slot machines.

Only came in here because they advertise the one dollar daiquiri's

Daiquiri Cup - $1 - 6 ounce cup. They have a ton of flavors to pick from. I like the cup size because you are not stuck with a big gulp size slushee all day. Sweet and not that strong but it cools you down on a hot vegas day."}
{"text":"get the extra shot!!!! I love this place play some pennies get lots of drinks the best place to start your downtown adventure!"}
{"text":"La Bayou is a fantastic Las Vegas spot. A little known fact, La Bayou is actually the oldest casino in Vegas. Don't miss this great spot on Fremont street, and be sure to try the daquiris!"}
{"text":"It's still as divey as ever here at La Bayou Casino.  It's run down, cramped and there's dusty stuff all over the walls and ceilings.  God knows I love this place!  It's one of the coolest places in downtown Vegas and they always get my business.

From the time you walk in the door and get your beads and raffle ticket till the time you leave, it's non-stop free drinks, cool employees and loose slots.

You know how most casinos only offer you free drinks when you are playing the $1 slots or better.  Not here!  I walked up, got some Mardi Gras beads and before I could sit down they asked me what I wanted to drink.  I hadn't gotten half way done and she are offering me another drink.  These ladies usually come by about once every 10 minutes so drink fast and get your moneys worth.  By the way, these aren't pussy drinks either - you can taste the alcohol.

Their slot machines are usually pretty loose (not this time but usually).  The machines are retro coin payers so don't be looking for slots with tie ins to the latest movies or TV shows and be sure to have a cup or two handy for your big win.

Like I said before, I'm still loving Barbara (manager) and Mary Ellen (cashier).  They are part of the experience and if they ever leave, the place just won't be the same.

Man I want to go back there right now."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC. Does not pretend to be anything more than what it is. The back bar is where its at, huge strong drink for 16 dollars, with a shot of ever clear for an extra 3. Worked like a charm. And they pay in coins! Brilliant"}
{"text":"It is what it is, a hole in the wall with giant cheap drinks and slots. Beware though, if you get the extra Everclear with the frozen drinks, you will most likely black out.. The drinks here are a great deal if your looking to get faded with a quickness. Also your friends will be telling you of all your adventures in the morning when you wake up to a neck full of puke covered beads. Good Times!!!"}
{"text":"This place was fun ! 
Had never heard of it before , and I'm glad we came in 
Made my wife and I feel like high rollers in this awesome casino on Fremont St. 
I won $35.00 in like 10mins , all nickels I might add  
La bayou is old school paying with coins joint , and it rocks ! 
Proceeded to play on 5ive dollars for like an hour while more drinks came !
My wife won $102.00 .
The casino also does a money raffle every half hour . If they pick your # you go to the wheel and what it stops on you get . This one guy from Australia won $2.00 ! I was jealous 
Both of us ,with a bit of a wobble wandered off to the next adventure awaiting us in downtown Vegas , with a pocket lined with cash ,and two bellies full of vodka cranberries like Otis from Mayberry . Good time"}
{"text":"This was a great dive bar to stumble into. They hand you beads as you walk in and offer football sized drinks. As a football lover, that was a major sell.
The service was quick! The drinks were decent. It was smaller than some of the other casino type diver bars. Not bad, just smaller.

If you are in downtown for the Fremont experience, this is a decent bar to \"stumble\" into."}
{"text":"It's a sad, sad day on Fremont Street when the Casino with the friendliest staff, best cocktails and cocktail service downtown and real coin-operated slots cashes in.  Looks like June 27 will be the end of a unique and memorable experience in Las Vegas!  Granite Gaming has sold La Bayou (and Mermaids and Glitter Gulch) to Derek Stevens and his brother to add to their current portfolio of properties:  The D, The Golden Gate and the currently shuttered Las Vegas Club.  The good news is I will be at my regular post at the Double Diamond slot with my regular beverage of choice for ten days starting Monday.  The BAD news is that when we leave Sin City on Cinco de Mayo, we will say goodbye to La Bayou and all our dear friends there for the very last time.  La Bayou has been, for many years now, the biggest reason we vacation in Downtown Las Vegas twice a year.  Best of luck to ALL the wonderful people who work at the Unpolished Jewel of Fremont Street.  You will truly be missed!  XOXOXOX, B&B"}
{"text":"Awesome dive bar and casino in one. You get party beads walking in the door, the free drinks come faster than any man alive can drink them, the machines are looser than any others downtown, and they have prize raffles every thirty minutes. The slots pay you in nickles so you get that classic clangity-clang sound when you cash out (and really dirty hands)."}
{"text":"Good strong drinks!  That is all and that makes me a fan.  A total dive.  Not that there is anything wrong with that."}
{"text":"If you are in Vegas, YOU MUST COME HERE!!!!

This was one of the highlights of my recent trip to Vegas. La Bayou offers REAL nickel slots, frozen daiquiris, FREE drinks (if you are gambling, but it's nickel slots), and a dive-bar atmosphere. Upon arriving you are greeted by two ladies dresses in traditional vegas show girl feathers who hand out beads to customers. The beads really add to the kitsch environment of Fremont Street and La Bayou. You are also handed a lottery ticket to enter to win up to $10,000, which was another source of free entertainment. 

The machines themselves work very well and it was so much fun playing actual coins and seeing them clink into the coin return tray. The waitresses were very attentive and friendly( Remember to TIP). I never had to worry about asking for another drink and the drinks were STRONG. 

La Bayou is a great time for the non-serious gambler who wants to enjoy their time in Vegas with cheesy promotions, strong drinks and a taste of whats left of old school Vegas. It's just a good time all around!"}
{"text":"So ive been to this place twice and both times it seemed like the place was either jam packed or else there is just not a lot of room in the place and makes it seem like there are a lot of people there.  

The thing that made us stop there was the 99 cent Huge yard tropical frozen drinks they have on the tv above the casino.  When we finally make it to the back where they serve the drinks we come to find out that the drinks are actually $20 for the yard size and the 99 cent ones don't even exist.  The Yard drinks were very nice none the less.  Just be warned that if you want to get a frozen drink there its going to be a lot more then 99 cents."}
{"text":"Fabulously dive-y! Free Mardi Gras beads were fun, and the reason we went in in the first place. Loved that it was all coins, and they had some really fun video machines. The staff were the friendliest were encountered anywhere in Vegas. Cocktail waitresses were fast, and drinks were strong, not the usual watered down comp drinks you get at most casinos.

The place was small, cramped and not very clean... but a blast none the less!"}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place! This has become our \"meetup\" spot downtown. It's a fun little dive. They give out beads and have raffles. They sell cool beads in the back and make awesome HUGE drinks in yards and footballs. They also have some old slots that you can't find very often, and the slots are fairly loose. We always win a bit of cash there. A small downside is that the slots are old school without tickets. They drop a ton of nickels if you win. It's minor though and actually kind of fun.

It's not fancy, it's just fun! Go!!!"}
{"text":"I love this little dive! 

A huge upside is the slots are old school. They drop a ton of nickels when you win. It's a huge bonus that makes it fun. The drinks are, as others have stated, excellent and alone worth coming in. 

There is not much to say about La Bayou that hasn't been said so give it a shot, this is the real thing.

There is a 96% chance I will return next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Most fun on Fremont! I've had the best luck with pay out at these machines, the wait staff is usually great and you never have an empty or even near empty drink! The frozen drinks are fantastic and usually whoever is working back there knows their mixes and always creates something you'll enjoy! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"}
{"text":"The slot machines in this casino still spit out coins!!!

Imagine my shock when I won $16 on a nickel machine and went to cash out, expecting a slip of paper to print out. Instead, chunks of metal started loudly hitting the metal tray on the bottom of the machine. After a moment of remembering what to do, I looked for a coin bucket and then had to scoop up all of the nickels. I forgot how much work that was! And how dirty your hands got from that. The tips of my fingers were black. My friend was playing on a quarter machine and was in the same shock when it started spitting out quarters at her. 

I was surprised this place was still there. I remember coming here about 10 years ago. Super low end small casino with only slot machines and some video poker. Grab some mardi gras beads and some raffle tickets before you go in. Every half hour they call a number and if your ticket has that number, you win something. The waitresses are super attentive. A few seconds after coming in and they want to service you with drinks. Everyone automatically orders drinks. Unfortunately, they end up being some of the worst drinks you have ever consumed. Everything tastes very watered down. I ordered a white wine and was brought this strangely sweet and carbonated drink that was more like a spritzer than wine. Besides the bad drinks, this place is pretty fun for awhile. It's a party atmosphere and they play some fun music. The machines aren't super tight and keep you playing for awhile. We were there for over a half hour as we heard two rounds of raffle numbers called. 

Definitely one of the weirdest casinos in Vegas but I always have to visit it when I'm gambling downtown."}
{"text":"Another one of those Old Casino places down on Fremont Street.

They stand outside and lure you in with the beads like the mermaid casino for free and they tell you to go in ~
This one is almost the same except they have cheap drinks and the big yard ones and they have daiquiris which I think are very sweet.

The machines are the same way with coins no tickets. A piece of old Vegas here.

The place is loud and they do a drawing but I myself have never won and never seen anyone win.  I did read in one of the reviews that someone really did win but only $10.00 better than nothing I guess.
So if you want to see old Vegas check this place out. No hotel here just a small casino, smokey at its best!  It is a little dive, touristy and can be fun if your with a group of friends getting the drinks... 
Check it out~"}
{"text":"Best place on Fremont! Staff is super friendly! Only place I have been greeted with a handshake and asked how I was doing. Everywhere else hounds you to sign up for some time share crap."}
{"text":"We always see people walking around with the football drink so we came over here to check it out on Aug 28. The bartender was very nice, she gave us free samples and ended up getting Sex on the beach and my husband got strawberry and banana, they have a great menu but you can mix it up and create your own creation. The drink was $ 17.00 and for an extra $4.00 they give you a healthy extra shots which is about 3 inches which ends up coasting $21.00. Save your football because you can get a refill for $10.00 which is good deal. 
Honestly if your not a heavy drink don't do the extra shot because you can get wasted very quickly. Pace yourself so you can enjoy yourself instead of making a fool of yourself.
At the end of the night we went back and asked if they can fill it up with ice water and they were very nice and gave us ice water. The bartender was very friendly."}
{"text":"Seedy spot for $1 daiquiris and yard mixed drinks. Prices aren't bad, so it's a good place for tourists. I've never gone when there wasn't a line, but it moves pretty quickly. Make sure to grab your free beads on the way in. Also one of the last places around where you can find slot machines that actually pay out and take coins."}
