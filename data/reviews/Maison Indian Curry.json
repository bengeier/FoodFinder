{"text":"Good quality indian food, tried kabab platter, channa bhattura & butter chicken thali. I was not impressed with tandoori chicken piece & butter chicken was too sweet for my taste. Kababs were really good though"}
{"text":"C'est une tres bonne adresse pour manger de la cuisine indienne de tres bonne qualité. Il est vrai que certains peuvent etre déçus par les thalis a cause peut être du manque de clarté sur le menu ou encore de la taille du plat. Pour le reste, ca vaut entièrement le coup d'autant que c'est vraiment pas pas cher. Foncez !"}
{"text":"Great food at a reasonable price. Good service. You are not here for ambiance, but authentic Indian food and they do a great job. We will go here again."}
{"text":"Maison Indian Curry has a few things going for it. Nice mango shakes, Indian beer and vast quantities of cheap eats dished up on shiny Thalis, in a newly-renovated environment.   I went there for a Masalah dosa, having heard that this was the place to go. What I got looked like a dosa, acted like a dosa, and almost tasted like a dosa.   The potato filling was good, although not particularly flavorful. The dosa itself was too crispy to use as a scoop for the filling. The flavors in the sambar were muddy and over-cooked. The coconut chutney was bland and utterly nondescript.   I have eaten excellent Masalah dosas in other North American cities (Pittsburgh, Chicago, Berkeley) and know how good they can taste. By comparison, this one was disappointingly generic."}
{"text":"love their dosa, chat papri, thalis. Its all very good. The madras chicken or lamb is one of my favs. Very good service and a clean place. Very good prices too.  their food is not spicy at all, you have to specify that you want it spicy.  I've been a regular since they first opened, 7 or 8 years ago.  Ohh and thank god this place doesnt have a big screen tv playing hindi songs. I cant stand those restaurants."}
{"text":"This restaurant is pretty much equivalent to Punjab Palace... Great Indian food at a great price! If you order a thali, you get the best bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"Accidentally found this place trying to avoid food I can't pronounce at the price I can't afford. This restaurant was surprisingly good in terms of food and the rates. We were visiting over the labor day weekend and just wanted a good lunch. The thali was amazing. This is not your usual Indian restaurant food. Its more like a Dhaba which makes it a little different in a good way."}
{"text":"I am always in the mood for Indian food and was thrilled to find a place with good reviews while visiting Montreal. The food was delicious, filling and priced extremely reasonably. I had a Mysore Masala Dosa and it was incredibly spicy (as it should be) and was pleased since I am used to dumb Indian restaurants in the U.S. serving 'spicy' food that ends up being closer to 'mild.' My friends had the Non-Veg Thali (chicken curry for one, lamb curry for the other). They said the food tasted very good; however, there were literally 3 pieces of chicken and lamb in each of their respective dishes.  The restaurant was clean and seemed like a popular lunch spot. The service was pretty good as well. I would definitely recommend eating here if you're in the mood for some yummy Indian food!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome and they had the best thing I've ever tried, Samosa's with Channa Masala, it was spicy and just wonderful.  The servers were fast and efficient and they had a huge variety on the Menu, not just north indian foods but south indian as well which isn't too common in indian restaurants in Canada.  People sitting behind us were annoyingly loud, other than that I have no complaints about my experience at this restaurant.  If you are in Montreal and in the area, this is a cheap place to eat and has amazing food."}
{"text":"Nice foods & beer. Affordable price. FYI, I had a chicken curry, a lamb curry & butter nan. But servers were too busy to handle all of customer's need. They were all kind though."}
{"text":"hi,I'm indian,I'm  new in Parc ex.n wanted to take my mom n her friend to a gd indian restaurant. so i went here. i asked for cha n it was watery.  i spoke,they changed it for another.  it's not bengali cha. if ur taste is based on bangali,u won't like it. but it was acceptable. so i ordered two vegi thali . one to eat in n one to go. i ordered 2nd vegi thali . i also ask two vatura,those puffy roti,to have a taste it with my mom. we waited until 5 nonindian was served to get my plate. actually more than one waitresses was attending tem. while i was waiting n watching 5 others being served.  i finally got my plate with one vatura,wen i asked for 2. so we finished one vatura 2nd one came after a while. i couldn't enjoy anymore, waited too long. felt forgotten,   if one vatura takes 15 minutes 2nd, 3rd don't take as much time bcuz the oil is already hot. i know tat. if they had time to serve 6 clients while we were waiting for 5 mins order, i don't  need anymore explanation abt there client relationship.    \"DO NOT GO\". I complain to the maneger,he didn't give a sh*t. no sorry.  i will tell all my friends not to go to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Decent Indian food for an affordable price. Despite being consistently packed, we have found that there are better options in the area for the same price. That being said, staff is accommodating, we know from take out, and the food is okay. Just what you'd expect a middle-of-the-line Indian restaurant."}
{"text":"Food is good, not the best Indian food in the area but still very good. Service is also good, except although the sign and site has opening hours, they will refuse to serve you unless it's takeout if the restaurant isint busy."}
{"text":"Never ever go there.  Chicken masala is a dried chicken bone with rice. This place is robbery."}
{"text":"This is the best indian place i've tried in MTL  the indian style butter chicken was an orgasm in my mouth the pakoras were extremely good and the service was impeccable. a great restaurant in NDG area."}
{"text":"Très bonne nourriture pour le prix, mais pas moyen d'avoir du service en français, ou du service tout court."}
{"text":"Good food, reasonable prices. Restaurant looks clean inside.  Details: Food was mediocre, nothing to be thrilled about but at the same time it was not bad. If I lived in the area I would maybe go there from time to time because of the price though, not the food specifically.  However, I live 50 minutes away from the place and I went there because a friend of mine suggested it to me. Because it was not anything extraordinary I will probably not go there again in the near future.  FOOD I ordered Chicken Korma with naan and I have tried it many times in different restaurants around the world and the korma I know is usually nicely sweet, sometimes even with raisins.  This Korma, sadly, was salty and a little bit bitter. There were a lot of kardamom seeds in it which made it probably so bitter. For me it was dissapointing. The naan on the other hand was very good.   My boyfriend had the Lamb Saag and according to him it was nice and he really liked it.  SERVICE The servis was nice. Girls were smiling all the time. I think the place is missing an order because as the place got more and more crowded, the service was struggling a lot.  It would be great if they divided the place into \"sections\" that would be waited by each waiter/ess separately. So they know who already ordered their food and who did not."}
{"text":"This place is known for their amazing Butter Chicken, so I had to try it. I know that Butter Chicken only represent a very little part of the Indian cuisine, but since it is present in every Indian restaurants, it makes a nice standard for me to see how good the place is.  To be quite honest, I was pretty disappointed with their famous Butter Chicken. The chicken was moist and tender, which was nice, however the sauce was way too sweet and had too much coconut milk in it. The lamb curry was very watery and salty, and had just a slight taste of cumin. The side salad consisted of few leaves of sloppy lettuce leaves and a slice of cucumber. The portions were very mediocre (at least the one we had) comparing to other places I've been to.  On the other hand, the lamb soup was quite nice, it was hearty and hot, perfect for a cold winter day.  I like how they serve their water in a bronze jug along with bronze cups, the decors were very nice and the ambience was great.  Maybe I went during an off-day, but I have to give the edge to Chand Palace across the street."}
{"text":"J'en ai les papilles qui s'éveillent rien que d'y penser! J'ai aveuglément suivi une amie dans ce restaurant dont elle me parlait avec enthousiasme. Malgré son avis déjà positif sur l'endroit en question, j'ai fait abstraction de tout ce qu'elle m'avait dit afin de pouvoir faire ma propre opinion là-dessus. Je peux vous dire que je n'ai pas régretté de l'avoir suivi les yeux fermés. Une explosion de saveurs sous mon palais. Nous avions droit à un plat composé de plusieurs spécialités indiennes dans le but de goutter à tout. Effectivement, nous sommes sortis de là le ventre plein (essayé de ne pas trop manger lors du repas du midi pour garder de la place dans votre estomac une fois le soir venu et ce resto indien connu!). Certes, le restaurant n'est pas \"superbe\" pour sa décoration, ça on est d'accord! Mais \"superbe\" pour sa cuisine, ah ça oui! Que de bons souvenirs gustatifs!"}
{"text":"The food was good but a little salty - we all ended up super thirsty after our dinners. The decor is one of the best for an Indian Resto (dim lights, clean) and the prices are cheap. The service is super fast so if you're going there to relax and enjoy a night out with friends, you may wish to go elsewhere. Our table was asked 4 times if we were ready to order when we literally just sat down! Then as we were just putting our forks down - still chewing on our last bites - the waitress came and picked up our plates! If it was a lunch - I get it, but we were trying to chill. Not the best place for that. You need to tell the staff not to pick up anything till everyone at the table is done eating otherwise you're left with some people with empty place mats while others are eating. Awkward. I think it's more of a lunch or take out place - or a place you go for a fast dinner."}
{"text":"You don't go there for the decor, nor the bring your own wine option. They don't have time for that ;) You go there because it's one of the best Indian options in Parc Ex, and trust me, I've tried them all few times prior to writing this review. The tali are generous unlike other places, the butter chicken is delicious and the lassi is also good. The service is efficient not really friendly but good. Our favourite spot in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I was wandering and spotted that restaurant, I quickly checked Yelp reviews and decided to try it myself. When I arrived I was seated promptly it wasn't very crowdy for a Saturday afternoon. The service was very quick, I ordered a mango lassi (I just love that drink) which happened to be one of the best I've recently tasted as well as the butter chicken menu. Hum... The main dish was good maybe it would have been better if I had more than two lonely pieces of chicken fighting for survival in the sauce. Overall it was a nice experience for the amount paid 7$/main dish and 3$/lassi. I would recommend this place for the rapidity of service and for it's affordable food."}
{"text":"Not an ideal place for a romantic date or something as the place is very crowded & the seating too congested but food is great if you wanna fulfill your craving for indian food ! I am a fan of their chaat papdi & that's mostly my reason to go there all the way from Laval."}
{"text":"Good price. Fresh naan bread. Their butter chicken is a must-try! Authentic Indian cuisine!"}
{"text":"I had daal makhani, tandoori chicken, a paneer curry with garlic naan. They were all good. I also had the lamb biryani which wasn't that good."}
{"text":"Lovely food, friendly service...that explains why it is crowded"}
{"text":"Best Indian food! They just renovated and have made it bigger and more comfortable! The food is amazing, really well priced- Thali plates for $6. Great for vegetarians. This is my go to place for really great Indian food."}
{"text":"I live in that area and i almost never tried any other indian restaurant on Jean-Talon, that place is too good. The palao rice is the best around, the butter chicken is perfectly balanced, the lamb curry's really good and the stewed eggplant is really awesome."}
{"text":"Great food and real inexpensive. Service Is a little slow. It is always busy but worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Déicieux et vraiment pas cher! 6$ le Thali végétarien."}
{"text":"Over the past year I've tried several Indian restaurants in the city. All have been underwhelming, suffering from one or more of the following: painfully slow service, a lack of fresh ingredients or tasting more like a fusion of Indian inspired dishes and missing the mark.  I'd heard that a mecca of Indian restaurant offerings was available in Parc-Extension. So when I finally did some online research to see what restaurants had received good reviews in the area I was optimistic when I happened upon Maison Indian Curry. I was especially excited that they offered some South Indian dishes. This restaurant exceeded any preconceptions that I had about what Montreal had to offer when it came to Indian cuisine. We started with Vegetable Samosa. Far from the overly greasy or dry versions that I've had this rendition was crispy, light and flavorful.  As a vegetarian I'm always happy to see Paneer Tikka Masala on the menu, a preparation usually reserved for poultry.  This dish was a little spicy as we had requested, but not not overly so. In the south Indian department we ordered a Masala Dosa. In addition we had a Dal Tarka and vegetable Korma. The Dal Tarka, a preparation of yellow lentils was unlike anything I've had before and was really quite good. The Vegetable Korma consisted of in season fresh vegetables, principally cauliflower in this case. It was a pleasant departure from the frozen pea and carrot mix often guilty parties here.  The Masala Dosa was a bit too crisp for my taste, but it was served with the traditional coconut curry and sambar which in combination with the Dosa were satisfying.  Overall I really enjoyed the food here and will be back in the future. I highly recommend this restaurant if you're looking for tasty, fresh Indian food and with a very reasonable tab to boot."}
{"text":"I am so glad this place renovated, it looks out of place in Parc Ex.  It used to be so cold in the winter here, I would have to put on my jacket while eating.  They specialize in south Indian Cuisine, so typically much spicier.  That was the only downside, it was not spicy enough.  I had the butter chicken thali, I know it's not supposed to be spicy, but it should not be sweet either. The rice was a bit under-cooked and the potato dish was a bit too sour. My friend had the lamb curry thali and he said the same thing.  The dosa was really good though, I get it every time I come here, The sambar really warmed me up on a cold day and the potato filling was a delight.   Chand Palace was better last time, thali wise.  If I go back, i'll explore the menu a bit more and get other stuff, I rarely get thali since it seems to be cooked for people that don't like spicy foods.  The service was quick and efficient and the restaurant was full on dec 23, when the whole city seemed dead.  The decor is quite nice and the prices are pretty good (they did not really jack up the prices for the renovations)"}
{"text":"Yesterday we were craving some cheap Indian street food and decided to try out this restaurant to check out what they had to offer. We ordered Pani Puri, Vada Sambar, and Masala Dosa. Things went downhill pretty soon. Now being born and raised in India, I am always (consciously or not) searching for a taste of \"authenticity\" when it comes to Indian dishes. Especially when an Indian restaurant lists regional street food (like Papri Chaat, Paani Puri, Vadas) in their menus, it generates high level of expectations along with great anticipation especially for immigrants to relive memories of their childhood, holidays and decadent street food in their original homeland. Some tastes are not to be messed with, even to try and justify the changes as innovation or \"to make it more suitable for North American taste-buds\".   I shall start with the Vada Sambar first. It was A TRAVESTY to say the least. I have been having Vada Sambar for over 28 years and have tasted it in different parts of India and outside of India too. This was the first time I saw anything like this. The Vadas came soaked in the Sambar, making them soggy and listless. One essential rule of thumb of Indian cuisine is that the bread cannot be soggy and if it loses its crunchiness, its unacceptable for the plate. Hold on,this is not over. As I took a small sample of the Sambar, I was confused. For the uninitiated, sambar is a lentil dish which is made with lots of vegetables (like eggplants and okra) and an essential ingredient in it is tamarind. Sambar is not authentic Sambar if not tempered with tamarind and a specific blend of spices (sambar powder). Here, the sambar they gave us, forget the T of tamarind, did not even have a single V of any vegetables. It was an unrecognizable flavor of a daal mocking to be sambar! The disappointment did not end here.   The masala dosa came next. Though it was as spicy as it claimed to be, the sauces/daals it came with again proved to be a blunder. Dosas, nowhere in the dosa world is ever served with pudina (mint) chutney. It is always accompanied by two lentil dishes, yellow sambar and the white coconut sauce. Here maybe because there was a third compartment in the tray and they didnt want it to remain empty, filled it up with pudina (mint) chutney. Guys, pudina and dosas do not go together. And they are not MEANT to be together either. What is meant to be together is Tamarind and Sambar. Please get chefs who are aware of complementing flavours of Indian spices, sauces. It seems they are stuck in generic North Indian onion-ginger-garlic paste flavoured dishes and needs some training in managing other regional food varieties. By this time, my disappointment had reached such a high level that I just wanted to end the experience and leave. I am a puchhka (another regional version of paani-puri) lover at heart and always felt that I am cheating on puchhka if I happened to like a paani-puri. Thanks to this restaurant, my loyalty to pucchka remains steadfast."}
{"text":"Omg wow. Since moving here from BC I've been craving good Indian food but have been consistently disappointed (to be fair had only tried 2 other places lol). I'm so happy I discovered this place! Ordered their butter chicken thali and was well satisfied. Butter chicken sauce was delish with the right amount of spice to make it still highly edible. Thali also came with fresh fluffy naan, rice, a tandoori drumstick and a tasty potato/onion dish. That, with a mango lassi and tip came out to less than $14 and left me super satisfied. Great service, will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"One of the best Indian restaurants I have ever been too which says a lot because Indian food is my all time favorite.  Went there for lunch on a Saturday and the place was packed.  Great prices and large portion sizes with a pretty large menu.  Try the tali lunch special which is a great bang for your buck.  Options include their famous butter chicken, curry lamb, or a vegetarian option.  Had plenty of leftovers and although the service was a little slow I could not be mad because there were only two waiters working and since it was so crowded they were running around the whole time.  They were very polite and continuously apologized (but like I said I couldn't be mad they were doing the best they could) Cash/debit card only FYI."}
{"text":"Very decent curry thali.   With a suprise piece of tandoori chicken.  Good nan. Etc, for only $9.00.  Lunch menu.  Including weekends. Efficient service, ok ambiance."}
{"text":"One of the worst Indian restaurants to ever visit. The customer service is deplorable, animals could treat and provide better service. I complained to the manager but was only rudely brushed off. The food was beyond disgusting, I have never ever eaten such horrible food in my life. I could have scooped up dirt from the street and it would taste better.   Don't ask for big plastic bags, the counter person has no idea what it is."}
{"text":"It's better  restaurant in terms of  quality food and also the price.  Better than the thali restaurant and Punjab palace in terms of taste  and pricing ..  Dont miss the  Chana samosa and the  sweet -gulab jamun here ..   Awesome ..  Thali is good and moderately priced ..  overall good food.  Even the chaats  r good and  nice hospitality .  it's a visit  again  restaurant for sure ..!!   Thumbs up."}
{"text":"De loin le meilleur indien que j'ai pu visiter de Montréal - et j'en ai fais beaucoup. Leur poulet au beurre est divin, ainsi que les autres viandes et sauces délicieuses. L'accueil est en anglais uniquement, et les serveuses sont relativement aimables. A part ça, et un stationnement peut être difficile, on se régale. Les portions sont énormes, et le prix définitivement très bas et raisonnable."}
{"text":"I would update my review only to say that while some things inevitably slip through the cracks, upon our last order we got some soups. My dad scooped up what looked like a metal thread from one of those steel-wool pot scrubbers or something similar. I'm sure it was an over-sight but we're lucky that he saw it and didn't ingest it or choke on it. Otherwise the taste is still great."}
{"text":"i like the mango juice,and the bread nam ...but the food was normal....."}
{"text":"Great discovery! Dishes had distinct flavours. Sizes are on the smaller side but prizes also are on the cheapest end. This allowd to try multiple dishes.   Service was pretty good. Restaurant was very clean.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I love their Indian thaali. Indian food is one of my fav cuisine and they did a good job. I love their samosas- so crunchy and the Indian street dishes too. They have a good service too. It's not too bad for the prices as well."}
{"text":"First time I have ever had dinner there. It was excellent!  Very impressed!  I had the butter chicken thali  and a delicious mango lassi. It included a piece of tandoori chicken, rice  and a spicy vegetarian potato dish, with green peppers, and onions, in sauce. Very tasty. There was also a green salad, included. The thali  was generous and very filing. Pappadum and Naan bread were also included.  My friend is a regular and knows this restaurant very well and loves it. She had the butter chicken as an entree, with Naan. And a mango lassi.  The food was wonderfully spiced and seasoned, cooked perfectly, and I know my Indian food... Portions were generous, the price was extremely reasonable, and the server was gracious, always attentive,  and helpful, despite being busy.  The ambience with the changing color waterfall was relaxing and soothing, and even though there were plenty of people there, it was a very relaxing experience.  The chairs are comfortable, silver water pitchers are provided at every table with matching goblets, and that is appreciated, when one is enjoying spicy cuisine.  I will be back regularly. I am looking forward to trying some of the other dishes. I had no idea this gem of a restaurant was so close to my neighbourhood! I highly recommend this wonderful Indian restaurant!"}
{"text":"I live nearby, so I've tried this place a few times. I think their dinner and lunch standards are quite different. I enjoyed my butter chicken (the chicken kinda melts in the mouth, the curry is not spicy enough, but I would rate it 8/10.), I didn't like my lunch set special which I had on another visit, there was BBQ chicken included - the chicken meat was so dry it is just not worth buying it. Yet, their salmosa was amazing to me (someone who never been to India), i went in sometimes just to get salmosa."}
{"text":"Les thalis sont un peu chiches : qu'un tout petit pilon de poulet tandoori, 2 petites portions de plats en sauce, et une salade pouet-pouet de laitue et 1-2 carottes sans rien. Mais, j'apprécie vraiment le fait qu'ils servent du riz, un demi-papadum ET un naan complet, ce qui n'est pas toujours le cas pour les thalis. Et à 9$ (le soir), c'est difficile de se plaindre! Mais quand même, j'aurais aimé un thali plus complet.  La nourriture est globalement très bonne, et le poulet au beurre est particulièrement savoureux. Hmmm, le poulet au beurre!   Autre hic, à toutes les fois que j'y ai été, j'ai trouvé le service un peu nul. Ça prend toujours très longtemps à nous remarquer et venir nous accueillir. La première fois que j'y ai été, avec 3 amis (alors que nous nous étions bien assurés qu'ils fermaient à 22h30 avant de nous asseoir), on nous a pratiquement mis dehors vers 21h45 en mettant toutes les chaises sur les tables, en lavant le plancher presque sous nous et en allumant les néons. Pour l'accueil chaleureux, on repassera."}
{"text":"I don't know how this place can have no reviews yet. It was packed and pretty good.   I went here because we were looking for south Indian food. They have north Indian food as well for those that are in the mood for that food, but I didn't try it so I can't comment on it.   Anyways, we ordered channa samosa, veg samosa, paneer dosa and masala dosa. All of the food was good and we definitely ordered too much for just two people. The masala and paneer dosas are very rich and very filling.  The paneer dosa was a hit with me. I was absolutely delicious. It might become a new staple with me. I highly recommend it.   The servers were friendly and efficient workers. The price was also right. Basically you can't go wrong.   It is a little walk, but not too far and definitely worth it, from Park Station."}
{"text":"Service interminablement long sans attention!  Il faut toujours supplier pour avoir du service. La jeune fille à échapper les cuillères en servant les plats. Elle n'est jamais revenue pour nous apporter d'autres cuillères..  Paneer madrasi: boff... Lamb kadahi: un peu salé, mais très bon et bien épicé Butter chicken: crémeux et tout en douceur...très bon"}
{"text":"My favourite Indian restaurant in the city. Just because of the convenient location and the great tasting food, the place feels like home. The Chana bathura is beyond amazing. The non-vege thali is pretty decent, however they increased the price recently. The butter chicken and lamb curries are super delicious and I prefer their naan a lot more than their chicken biriyani. The chicken biriyani includes the same chicken from the butter chicken, rather than legs making it less tasty. The naans are very fresh and fantastic to eat with the curries."}
{"text":"amazing foods, amazing value. I would say It's the best in the town!  better go to the restaurant earlier and try that real indian samosa. it's pretty loud and busy at dinner."}
{"text":"Première expérience à ce resto aujourd'hui.  Je voulais m'entraîner, j'ai décidé de manger de la bouffe indienne à la place. Sûrement une de mes meilleures idées à vie.  Accueil timide, je crois qu'on ne m'a même pas remarquée. Aucun blâme; j'ai été subtile et je suis arrivée vers 11h30.   Alors, est-ce que c'est charmant? Oui.  Est-ce que c'est bon? Excellent. J'ai pris le thali poulet au beurre. Petites portions, mais tout est délicieux.   P'tite cuisse de poule, 4-5 morceaux de butter chicken, mixture de légumes en sauce brune dont j'oublie le nom parce que mes skills et connaissances en cuisine ne vont pas beaucoup plus loin que le grilled-cheese, un petit brin de laitue, du riz basmati cuit à la perfection, un immense pain naan et cette galette étrange et salée avec des p'tites graines dedans. MIAM POUR TOUT, LES AMIS.  Si vous avez un appétit d'ogre, je suggère de choisir autre chose. Cela dit, c'était parfait pour moi. Pour 7$ plus taxes, yo.   Cet endroit est plus qu'un resto, c'est une expérience sensorielle exceptionnelle. La bouffe, la musique, j'y retournais n'importe quand (particulièrement au lieu d'aller au gym)."}
{"text":"Excellante nourriture indienne, un peu trop  piquant pour certaines personnes! Rapport qualite prix incroyable."}
{"text":"Visited this place few weeks back, lucky for them it was a tiring long day so we were like four hungry bears who could gobble up anything that resembled food.   Maison Indian curry still exceptionally managed to ruin our palates. It started with the dirty tables, then the Indian staff who despite working around Indians day in and day out- managed to have an accent that switched between British and American every few seconds and lastly the sad excuse for Indian food.  The food service was quick, but that's cause they didn't put any effort into it. It was bland, the chicken tasted like it was made long back and just dunked into gravy. The paneer was the only thing everyone ended up having. The breads were good and soft.   I'd never return there and wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. The service was below average and it was too cramped (claustrophobic people take note)"}
{"text":"I've been to a few Indian Restaurants in Montreal, but when I found this one, I looked no further, when I could make it out towards Jean Talon.  I've been here about 15 times, and it has never disappointed me.  It's authentic, and the prices are outstanding (I ate here often when I was a student).    They accommodate to spices (mild to burn your esophagus), they are efficient, fast, and of all the people I have brought here, everyone is always shocked at how great and cheap it is. A few of my friends swear on the lamb curry, the butter chicken, pakora, samosa, for me its all about the eggplant bhaji! Their garlic naan is fresh and perfect consistency, and their roti is top notch too.   If you ever crave indian food, and willing to do a small trek, this is worth every penny, and every minute getting there."}
{"text":"We came here on our anniversary and accidentally (on purpose) ordered wayyy too much food and it was fun and glorious. The service was sweet and a little flustered. We had no problem ordering and getting water and our bill and stuff but we saw some other tables around us having trouble. It's a joyful chaos in my opinion and you need to be in a laid back good mood to enjoy it. Skip it if you're not feeling that.   The food is high quality and delicious. Sometimes Indian food destroys me, which I don't blame on the food but on my crazy-person insides. But I had no issue at all here. There's tons of spice, the flavours are layered and delicate, the breads gorgeous and fresh. All in all, I'm super thankful to Yelpers for directing us here when we searched for vegetarian Indian! We've both tried a ton of different spots making great food in this area and our hopes were high and we were delighted."}
{"text":"This used to be our favorate Indian restaurant in the area but it was a big disappointment this time around. We ordered two meat thali and it was ok. The price went up but the quality and quality of the food went down. We also ordered a butter chicken and a curry lamb. The taste were flat and just a very few pieces of meat per serving. Over all not satisfy and will not go back."}
{"text":"I am a regular at this restaurant and the service and the food is always consistent.  The food is always fresh, hot and delicious. I'm from beautiful Vancouver, B.C., where there's a largely populated Indo-Canadian community, and the food is up to par with Vancouver standards. I encourage you to ignore all the other restaurants around this establishment and please come enjoy this hidden gem of a restaurant in the Parc Extention."}
{"text":"I must say that the food was AWESOME! I've been to more than a handful of Indian restaurants that were more expensive and none have been as tasty. I had the non-vegi Thali pictured below and although the portions are moderate, the butter chicken sauce was the best I've ever tasted. I'm not a saucy type of guy but I actually scraped it up with my Naan bread at the end. The iceberg lettuce was really bad though (and the baby carrots straight from the bag) but you don't come here for the salad anyways.  The best part is that it's $6. You can barely even get 1/3 of a movie ticket for that price nowadays. I will go back."}
{"text":"Didn't dine in, but had a take out order for Veg Biryani, Paneer Butter Masala and Butter Naans. Had to wait longer to get the food, but the wait was worth. Taste was really good and the price was very reasonable for the quantity they served. I will definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to have good and decent Indian food."}
{"text":"Very good food at reasonable pricing.  I let my friend do the ordering but all the dishes we good were very good.  Expect to leave this place with a curry smell so if you plan to go out after dinner, I wouldn't recommend you going there.  The place is renovated so it looks pretty clean compared ro other Indian restaurant in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"luv this place, quick service, great staff, and the food was delicious, i had the channa samosa, and the vegetable pakora along with tandori shrimp, best i ever had,they present them to you in a sizzling hot plate with lime mm mm good, and the best part of it all the price, good portions for a very low price, i will be going back over and over again i'm always satisfied when i go there!"}
{"text":"Has to be one of the best Indian restaurants in Montreal without costing you a fortune.  Let's see... in terms of bang for the buck... it blows away restaurant Gandhi which is no slouch but way to pricey for the food.    I love this place when I'm in the mood for a little Indian however, go early cause I think half of Parc Ex knows it's one of the best out there, so the place gets packed.  Channa Samosa.... drool....."}
{"text":"Came to this Indian restaurant on the recommendation of a pal. From the outside, it seems like not much. But on the inside, is a busy and bustling little joint.   The menu is robust and very cheap. You've got tons of options for those looking for everything from veg options to chicken to seafood. So if you are visiting with friends who have different dietary needs, you'll be in luck.  The veggie pakoras were a little denser than I would have liked, but it didn't ruin the meal. Saag paneer was little some of the best I have ever eaten. The paneer cheese was light, delicate and literally just melted in your mouth. The daal makhani was buttery and smooth and cooked to perfection. Also, the butter chicken curry was out of this world. So rich and wonderful.   I split the bill with my friend and for 3 mains and two appetizers and an order of garlic naan and rice, my total came to $26 with tax and tips. Seriously, eat here. It's cheap and probably some of the best Indian food in Montreal."}
{"text":"By far the second best Indian restaurant in the city (number one is twice as expensive) and the first in the area. the food is excellent and the service is good and helpful. their dishes are authentic and not altered to north American taste, which is as Martha before going to the big house used to say \"is a good thing\". I love this place and go there anytime I get a chance or my cholesterol level allows!"}
{"text":"I ordered 2 vegetarian Thali on Mothers day and when I got home I saw they were Lamb Curry instead, I called the store and spoke to the owners son Rohan who told me to come in anytime for a refund or to get something else.  I took some pictures just in case of the meat as evidence.  Today I went back and the Owner Rajesh Chopra was so rude and started yelling at me and trying to tell me first that the curry in the pictures was not his and then after I showed him the receipt he tells me its not meat when its obvious it is. He takes a look at the pictures on my phone and then tries to take my phone from my hands and break it!  He then takes me into the kitchen and what I saw almost made me vomit and not ever want to eat here, the cooks are sweating into the food and no one is wearing gloves or a hairnet, The worst part is I saw rat droppings on the counter!  If you saw this place you would run far!"}
{"text":"So this place wasnt really that bad at all. My friend took me here after they had done their renovations. I was pretty impressed. Like most indian restaurants I have been to, this lamb biryani too was just mixed plain rice with curry. It was a bit dissapointing, but i enjoyed their lassi, along witht heir butter chicken and channa bhatura (chickpea something.) Aside from that service nice and prompt. The decor with the new renovations clean and modern and left nice desi touch overall too.   Even though prices were moderate, my friend admitted that the portion sizes compared to their prices earlier had gone up a notch. Oh well as long as the quality of the food is not compromised its all good for me.  Last tip of the day: stay away from biryanis here except the veggie one, Stick to non veg and regular veg/non veg curries you'll be fine."}
{"text":"Je ne suis pas experte en nourriture indienne, mais selon moi c'était très bon et pas très cher. Donc rapport qualité prix excellent à mon avis. Surtout si on y va à plusieurs et qu'on partage!"}
{"text":"Avec une amie, nous sommes venus dans le quartier car il est réputé pour les épilation au fil pas trop cher, mais le quartier est aussi connu pour ses bons restaurants indiens. Nous avons choisi celui ci par pur hasard et surtout car nous n'avions pas de vin et la majorité des restaurants sont des apportez votre vin. Ce qui est décevant, c'est qu'ils n'offrent que de la bière comme alcool, ce que je n'aime pas du tout... mais bon! L'établissement est propre, nous étions là vers 17h et il avait quand même un certain nombre de clients, j'imagine que pour que l'heure du souper cela doit affluer. Le service est rapide, mais je vous le dis tout de suite froid et presque exclusivement en anglais. On ne vient pas nous voir pour vérifier s'il manque quoi que ce soit ou si nous apprécions les plats. J'avais pris un poulet au beurre (8$), accompagné de riz blanc (2,50$) et d'un pain naan (je crois 1,50$). Mon poulet au beurre était trop bon, vraiment épicé, la sauce crémeuse. Le pain naan également un délice, il y a seulement le riz que j'aurais pu ne pas prendre car j'étais déjà bien remplie et surtout il était sec.  J'aurais donné un 4 étoiles si le service avait été un peu plus chaleureux et si la carte d'alcool avait été plus diversifiée. Mais je recommande tout de même ce restaurant, car côté qualité-prix, il en vaut largement la peine :)"}
{"text":"A decent Indian restaurant in the midst of busy streets. Stopped by for early dinner and was surprised to see how all the tables were occupied. Luckily we got a place quickly.  Orders took quite sometime coz of the busy hours I guess. I got a non vegetarian thail. My husband got a vegetarian thail. Yes, thali served for dinners too here.  The veg thali had two vegetarian curries, one black lentils curry plus roti n plain white rice. On the other hand the non veg thali had one starter (tandoori leg) one veggie curry (black lentils) and one chicken curry plus rice n roti.  The quality was good and the quantity was sufficient for one person.  The price is quite reasonable. It's crowded during lunch and dinner time, make sure you stop by early so that you avoid waiting.  One down point is that the place is filled with tables you have to swish in between to sit down."}
{"text":"Great Indian restaurant!   The chicken dishes are 100% pure white meat - which is a bonus.  The Chicken Tikka in particular was a real treat and is served on a sizzling cast iron plate piled high with onions and other veggies.  The Taj Mahal & Corba beer on tap are perfect for pairing with the spicy & sweet dishes.... and are a bargain at $5 a pint!  Spent $75 for 2 people including beers and had a full meal for 1 leftover to take home."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there today. We ordered panipuri and masala dosa. The pani puru was bot what i has expected at all. We were both dissapointed but then again we ARE bengali, I guess punjabis make it differently. The dosa was, as my husband says 'el perfecto'.  The restaurant has a nice ambience and we both loved that they serve water in a very old timey looking brass jug and goblet. The other items were resonably priced. Would go there again."}
{"text":"My favourite Indian restaurant in montreal esp comparing to how affordable it is, everything i tried there so far has been delicious"}
{"text":"I've had cravings for Indian food so after a bit of research and recommendation from a friend, I had to try this place. I've been twice in the past week now and can definitely see myself as a regular. Tasty, affordable, lots of choices in a low key setting, although it does get loud and cramped. Maison Indian Curry is very popular, people stroll in for take out and meals by the minute it seems.  I've tried their chicken saag, butter chicken, kabab naan rolls, shrimp biryani, dal makhni (lentils in a creamy sauce) and vegetable samosas which were all delicious. I love that their currys aren't watered down, sauces are always rich and great for dipping. The mango lassi is a must, especially for someone like me who doesn't tolerate spicy food very well, this thick yogourt drink helps cool me down instantly.  My only concern was that service can be a little slow and the prices advertised aren't always what you end up paying as servers are prone to making mistakes. All their orders are written on paper and then they add up the final price manually on a calculator, there were some disparities. Samosas are listed as 2$ on menu, I paid 1.50$ no complaint there, and they even forgot to charge me for another order of it, but then the kabab roll cost me a dollar extra.  Everything is pretty cheap but if you're ordering a multitude of things, be careful of inaccurate orders!  Note, this place takes debit and cash only. And it is NOT a BYOW restaurant. We saw a couple people show up with bottles, probably confusing Indian Curry with another Indian competitor from across the street."}
{"text":"Their chenna bhature is delicious and their veg thali is my favourite! Paneer tikka masala is my another favourite ;) ! I won't recommend their dosa ( their sides for dosa is not the best!)"}
{"text":"The best Indian place I have found in Montreal. As a Surrey girl at heart this restaurant makes me very happy.  Good prices, good portions, good naan. The bad thing is there inconsistent spice level. They warn me about a dish being spicy and I say great bring it.  They set it down warn me again. I try it? Not spicy at all. Even my spice sensitive boyfriend agreed. Im scared to ask for something spicy though because one of the \"mild\" dishes we ordered was more spicy? So confused. Anyways, most things have good flavour.  Favourites so far: chaana samosa, any tikka masala dish, vegetable korma. Malai kofta was decent, vegetable pakora  were good.  Didn't love the chana masala or the bindi dish (excuse my spelling for all of these, apologies).  Their ras malai and gulub jaman were also tasty."}
{"text":"I always go to Chand Palace across the street, but my friends recommended this place, so i gave it a shot.   We were seated very quickly, but as it got later, the restaurant became more and more crowded.   The plates/cups/utensils/tables are a lot nicer than Chand Palace. The entire restaurant has a fancier vibe.   The food is a little more expensive here.   I had a samosa craving, so I ordered 4 samosas (2 for 2,50$). It's a bit more expensive since their neighbour sells 3 for the same price.   In my opinion, these samosas did not taste as good. They seemed more oily and the outside was too thick.   On a plus side, they give two full bottles of sauce, so no risk of running out!   I tasted my friends dishes and we also ordered some veggie pakoras. Everything was good, but the common thread seems to be how oily everything was!   The naan was actually glowing, because of the amount of oil that covered it!   The service was nice. Nothing exceptionally remarkable about it (very average).   All in all, I'm glad I tried it, but next time, I'm sticking to Chand Palace!"}
