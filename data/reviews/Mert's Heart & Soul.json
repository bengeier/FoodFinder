{"text":"The food was terrible!! Do yourself a favor by going somewhere else. There was literally nothing that my husband and I liked that we ordered! Collard greens and Mac n cheese were by far the worse I've ever had!! Smh! 1 word... disappointing!"}
{"text":"Food was VERY good. We had a picky eater with us who claimed he did NOT like \"greens.\"  Our waitress Paris suggested he try their greens. He did. He now loves greens! I had some, too, and they were very good. The cornbread is also very good. And the fried chicken. Actually, everything we ate was very good. I ordered the catfish and was reluctant at first since they give you a whole fish and I feared getting the meat off the bones. Nothing to fear; the flesh slides so effortlessly off the bone that it was a pleasure eating it - and quite tasty with that \"special sauce.\"   Paris waited on us hand and foot. She had good suggestions from the menu and she kept our beverage glasses full. She was very friendly and a delight to have serve us.  We dined outside since there was a nice cool gentle breeze blowing. I wish the outside ambiance was nicer; maybe they can surround it with more potted trees/shrubs to block it from the street.   I would recommend eating here if you like good home-cooked food."}
{"text":"Food was great!! But to get seated is sometimes is a extremely long wait. It seems the business is under staffed the waitress are sometimes running around with there heads chopped off.  But still good food!!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I have been here numerous times and the food is a 10. Today, we had the fried chicken which was perfectly crispy, Mac n cheese just like your grandmothers, greens like you have never had before and the amazing cornbread. We even ordered a piece of strawberry and coconut cake to go for our 3 hour drive home. Today, I was beyond disappointed. The service was a 0. The hostess was kind and seated us-I should have left her the tip. Our server came and never made eye contact with either of us. After I told her my order she repeated something completely different. So, I repeated it again as she turned around to check out the guys who walked by to sit at the table behind us. We ordered coffee in which took 10 minutes to get and we were never offered a refill. Actually, the server did not even bring our food and only came back tothe table when it was time to take our plates. Finally, we track her down to ask for the cake and a box to go. She brings the cake but no box and seemed frustrated when I ask for the box again. My boyfriend spoke up and ask for the check. She laid it down and walked off. I decided to pay at the door only to be told to go back to my table and my server would have to take my payment. I told her I didn't want to wait. She said I will have her come up. Then, 5 minutes later she came upset and rang me up and laid the my receipt down and said you can just leave the signed copy here and walked off. Never have I ever actually left a restaurant and not left a tip. Today was the first time  I have actually had my dining experience ruined by poor service. I did not leave a tip. It's really a shame because as I said the food here is exceptional but I refuse to go back to such poor customer service."}
{"text":"Recently visited Merts and was VERRRRY disappointed. The first thing that greeted me when I walked in was the low sanitation score (90) the decor was dark and drab and the fruit flies kept me swatting the moment we walked in the door. As for the food. The collard greens were hard, crunchy and gritty. Quite frankly they were disgusting. They also lacked flavor. I had the Merts appetizer platter. I  noticed the chicken was not properly cooked and the soul rolls were realllly disappointing. I did not like the sweet sauce that they were coated in and they left me with a weird taste in my mouth. Salmon cakes were just ok. But after a under satisfying experience with the other food, it was hard to enjoy anything on my plate. I hope to NEVER visit this place again. If you are in search of soul food, I would look elsewhere. Kings Kitchen is a few blocks away and deliver a much better meal experience and cleaner environment."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Food was great!!   Fried whiting-Meaty, seasoned well and ooooo so delectable  Mac and cheese-cheesy, tasty and just plain ol good  Greens-good but didn't really care for the chopped onion and tomatoes a bit tart, next time I will try their string beans  Cornbread-SOOOOO tasty, moist and sweet!   My boyfriend got fried chicken, salmon cakes, mac and cheese and yams and he almost bit his fingers off!! He loved his meal   Service was great, the owner is so nice and friendly   My only gripe is that their isn't a location in Maryland :-( I will def be back next time I'm in Charlotte!!"}
{"text":"I loved my first visit, had been wanting to go forever based on recommendations from friends. Delicious corn bread, fabulous fried catfish (slightly spicy batter and perfect tartar sauce), Mac and cheese and black eyed peas. The best part was the Texas Pete vinegar pepper sauce on the table, perfect for my peas. Too full for dessert, although tempted."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely filthy!  The service was deplorable.  The food was mediocre.  But when you start off with poor service a flthy table and utensils, it's difficult to anticipate good food.  The server was unprofessional and inattentive.  We told the manager about the service and having to send the food back to be cooked thoroughly and it was clear that the server reflects the poor management style.  This place was run like a zoo.  Our overall experience was very disappointing.  I think it's interesting that the Yelp reviews tend to be more favorable.  We should have read Urbanspoons reviews also.  Had I seen their reviews, I would have never tried this place.  Ugh!"}
{"text":"Food is okay, not the best soul food. The best part about the meal was the cornbread, the worst part was the boxed cake they serve and market as homemade. I know boxed cake when I taste it. Definitely not worth the cost. May have just been my waitress but she was very inattentive, was more interested in talking to coworkers than making sure we were okay. The lemonade also wasn't very good. Tasted too sweet. Overall, if I could never find another decent soul food restaurant in Charlotte I'd come back, but if I can (which I'm sure I will) I will never enter this place again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been fans of Mert's since forever now. We LOVE their food and the soul put into it. However, the past 3 times we have gone recently, something has been either wrong or uncooked, and it just leaves us speechless in what has become of Mert's. The customer service is lacking horribly, service is sllooowww, chicken has been under-cooked two times now out of our 3 recent visits, and the list goes on. All these downs have swayed us away from Mert's now unfortunately. Every time we want to grab something soulful to eat, we think of Mert's....then remember what has happened the last three consecutive times....and then we back out and chose elsewhere. Truly unfortunate, but I would rather not risk spending $30+ to have uncooked food or feel as though we do not even exist in a restaurant that should be serving us, taking our orders, refilling our drinks without us wondering around to find someone to do so :( Really hoping for the best and that the management there straightens up and get this place in shape again."}
{"text":"3 stars AT best. I don't think the food is anything special. Don't get me wrong, it didn't taste bad, but I don't think it is worth 4 stars. I ordered the catfish and fried chicken quarter leg with mac and cheese and seasoned rice. My GF ordered the beef ribs with okra and tomatoes and home fries. We both didn't think anything was seasoned well/had any great flavor.  The service was great though. We were welcomed and seated very quickly (we arrived at 6:30PM on a Friday night). Overall, I don't think it was anything special. Like other people have said, it wasn't bad, but I wouldn't go back again."}
{"text":"Great fried chicken southern style, greens and Mac n cheese. Staff great food great. Left satisfied with an extra cornbread to go."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE customer service! (Not the waitress). The food was warm, had little flavor, and a simple menu item that read differently from what was expected was not offered to be negotiated. From where I'm from, when something reads \"smoked turkey\" you are expecting just that, not smoked turkey sausage (round slices of a turkey sausage). Even when given the pass of a misunderstanding, the manager (\"owner's daughter\" as she so often identify herself) was more interested in making HER point than making sure out of state customers who went out of their way to visit the establishment....and checked-in on Facebook have an enjoyable experience. She was sarcastic & unprofessional. Sorry my family had THAT experience."}
{"text":"Soul food is ok...needs more seaoning and to be drained of grease. My entire rating is based off the customer service which was very rude and disrespectful for me as a customer. The wait was long and don't try to make reservations because they dont take on weekends.  The waitresses have bad attitudes and rush you when ordering. ...\"imma take yall drink order and food order at the same time so who first?\" (Her exact words). I live in charlotte and have been here prior to this visit but will never return again. This was by far the worst soul food experience."}
{"text":"Had lunch at Mert's, Fried Chicken Wings, Mac and Cheese and some of the best collards I've ever had.  Corn bread was moist and a good portion of it.  Over all it was a good dining experience, I'd definitely recommend this resturant for some GREAT soul food.    VISIT Mert's and recommend it."}
{"text":"I spoke with Veronica the general manager. She apologized profusely for the mix up and assured me that she spoke with the staff. Ultimately, there was confusion about who was responsible for our table. She indicated that a long wait to be acknowledged is not common practice.  She invited me back to the restaurant. Based in her response, I will give them another try and hopefully add more stars. I was so disappointed because I was hungry and really wanted to try the seafood omelette."}
{"text":"Amazing food and very friendly staff. The fried chicken is so crisp and juicy. My girlfriend and I love the place."}
{"text":"Breakfast food is excellent, so is the service and restaurant."}
{"text":"We had lunch there I had  BBQ ribs , fried chicken , back eye peas , and okra. The chicken was done perfect crispy moist on the inside . the barbecue ribs had a vinegar-based with a little bit of spicy action going on . The Okra was good , kind of tasted a little bit like squash with light tomato base in there. Yes I would go back it was comfort food all the way. Our waitress made us feel  right at home."}
{"text":"Excellent! Home cooking, friendly service and the pies are amazing!!"}
{"text":"I will start by saying the customer service was good. . .stale but good! If it the customer service was as bad as the food then I would've given 1 star. . .For drinks, we ordered Arnold palmers . . . Watered alll the way down. Appetizer we ordered the soul rolls. They were good but nothing to rave about. On to dinner: my date ordered the special of the day which was pork chops w/ a side of cabbage and yams. The pork chops were dry and heavily dusted with an unflavored spicy seasoning. The cabbage was bland and didn't taste like anything at all. The yams were extremely dark and had a layer of butter/oil on top which made it inedible. My date tried a bite of everything and couldn't finish her meal or beverage. My meal was the chicken tenders with a side of red beans AND a side of rice( btw they should just make red beans and rice one COMPLETE side, but since I'm not looking forward to returning. . . I digress ) the rice was yellow AND unflavored. The beans were unseasoned in a watery liquid. While trying to get the waitress' attention to let her know we were unsatisfied, a homeless man was trying to ask us for money on the street. The mgr quickly got rid of him when she saw him approach. She handled it very well. We then told the mgr about our issues and we paid for the soul rolls only because we are all of it."}
{"text":"This restaurant has many things going for it and many things detracting from it.  Pros: -DELICIOUS cornbread and sweet tea.  Delicious. -Otherwise, the food is pretty good. The decor is fairly authentic.  Cons: -The service is hit or miss. -Everything seems a little pricey for what it is. -Mert's is uptown so parking can be difficult.  I have been a couple times and I am sure that I will go again, but it is not everything it could be."}
{"text":"From the service to the food, everything was AMAZING!!! The restaurant is so cute, quaint and comfortable. We are visiting Charlotte for the weekend and this is a true staple that I will tell everyone about. Daris was our server and he was so engaging,  funny and so attentive. We had no problem tipping over 30%. Saan came over and gave us a few laughs too. Even the chef came out, checked on us and cracked a few jokes. We appreciate all these wonderful qualities in a restaurant. Now, finally, the cornbread...it melts in your mouth. It's kind of ridiculous how delicious it is . OMG!!! Mert's is a hit!"}
{"text":"Upscale soul food.  Cornbread, fried chicken, pork chops, salmon cakes, beef ribs, shrimp and grits, red beans, mac n cheese.  Man I wish there was a joint like this in SF!  My Dad once had the soft shell crab hoagie and almost cried it was sooo good..."}
{"text":"My buddy Bob and I were in town for a convention this week.  Wanted to go local and have a meal that I wouldn't get up in NJ.  Merts did not disappoint. It's not upscale, fancy, yuppified, or pretentious. Everything was a little unique to Merts. Waitress sold us on her favorites which, for us, was dead on.  The beef ribs and pulled pork melt in your mouth delicious with an outstanding tomato and vinegar based sauce. Sides of okra, collards, Mac & cheese paired well. The sampler platter was very unique for a BBQ joint and is a must to try if your are willing to try something new. The Corn bread and sweet butter was a great compliment to the meet.   It's half the price of Roosters up the street and you will not leave hungry.  The very next day we were craving for more."}
{"text":"Was in Charlotte for two days and Merts Heart & Soul was recommended by everyone. Good food great location and I was impressed by the price. I went for Dinner Saturday then brunch on Sunday. I recommend it to"}
{"text":"Worst hostess ever! So rude and mean! I guess she is too good and smart to need customers! Not a good person for Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I think that this place is worth going to just for the corn bread they bring you before the meal.  It is the best corn bread that I have ever tasted (and they serve it with honey butter, yum).  They are the urban sheek version of soul food, but I still love the fried chicken there."}
{"text":"Excellent southern staples and great atmosphere and reasonable prices. Highly recommended. We came here with our kids and it was a good fit for the too. Loved the fried catfish."}
{"text":"Okay in a pinch.... Was headed to a performance at Blumenthal's Performing Arts Center and needed a convenient spot to enjoy pre-performance dinner. Liked the atmosphere and friendly staff, but at best, the food was fair. I gave them three stars because of the prompt service and attention of our wait person. This was my second visit in two years and I was was unexpectedly disappointed. I ordered beef BBQ ribs, collard greens, mac n cheese and cornbread. Beef ribs are not typically tender so I was not surprised at the lack of tenderness, but they were tasty. I'm not sure what was going on with the collards. They were tough and somewhat bitter. On my previous visit, the collards were 5-star tender, succulent and tasty. Maybe it was a market issue where there was no  access to greens of a better texture. The mac n cheese was a little dry but the taste was spot on. The meal was not terrible, but I was disappointed. At one point a representative approached our table and asked if we were the patrons who had a problem with the fish. We were not, but that means someone else didn't enjoy their dinner either. I suppose I would be willing to chance another visit, but none of my party of six are willing to come with me. What a shame."}
{"text":"The cornbread was delish. The soul rolls are the best that I've had. I got the rib/chicken breast combo with Mac n' cheese and mash potatoes. The rib is a California style cut and the sauce is vinegar base so it depends on what u like. The potatoes were flavorful and I'll probably opt for cabbage next time. Overall, the meal was good."}
{"text":"I have eaten here since it  opened- Being a professional Symphony Musician sometimes it is good to get a good hearty meal before I go to the Blumenthal to perform. I love the fried chix, green beans and collards  and cabbage -- occasionally the collards need to be prepped a little better to get  all the grit out, though.  servers  are nice and will get you out if you are in a bit of a hurry .I recommend Merts for some for good, hearty Southern cooking!"}
{"text":"We stumbled across this spot while visiting for the CIAA. Needless to say the wait was crazy long but it was well worth it. I thoroughly enjoyed everything from the cornbread to the fried fish. If soul food is what you're looking for look no further."}
{"text":"Waited 45 minutes to get in at 8pm on Friday, that wasn't the bad part though.. Waited 30 minutes for our drinks (our waitress didn't even show up, the host had to bring them) and after that, 2 hours for our food. By time it got to us we were so sick of waiting and so tired since it was 11pm that we could barely eat.    The food wasn't particularly good, I ordered the chicken and macaroni with green beans. Chicken was dry, green beans under seasoned and bland. The macaroni was good, they used cream cheese or something that tasted okay. They got two orders wrong in our party of 4 though.  The waitress apologized profusely and we received a discount for our wait but I will not return to this place again.    TL;DR  Over three hour wait for mediocre food and poor service."}
{"text":"Solid low country comfort food.  Huge portions and good service.  If you are ever in Charlotte, this is a good place to visit for a local taste.  The collard greens were good, the back-eyed peas were standard but the catfish was a bit fishy and the breading was too thick.  The short ribs had a vinegar bite that I didn't find appealing.  I know there are some people who probably love it that way but it didn't work for me."}
{"text":"This place is great!  I'm always 95% satisfied with the food here.   Service is very friendly and fast.  And you can't beat the prices!  Daily specials are very good!   I think everyone should give Mert's a try."}
{"text":"Great space, excellent staff, good food. Visited the city for memorial day weekend, 2015 and had an exceptional experience. This establishment contributed to my wonderful time. SO enjoyed our waitress who was friendly, informative, and entertaining. She \"schooled us\" on the fact that there, lemonade and iced tea mix was called a \"Tiger Woods\" - NOT an \"Arnold Palmer.\" #ILive!"}
{"text":"This review is based on the BBQ sandwich and macaroni - awesome. The sandwich is a perfect blend of tender meat and sauce. It's not overkill with meat falling all over the place. If you want a sloppy concession stand type sandwich this isn't the place for you. However, if you want a bbq sandwich you can brag about when someone asks about NC bbq, this is the spot. Oh, the macaroni is ridiculous. I believe it's homemade. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Was it good?  Of course.  Was it great? Meh.  We got the fried chicken, and it was just your typical fried chicken greasy mess.  We sat at an outside table, which was not all that clean, but our server was entertaining, so we let it slide.  Overall, I give this place a run-of-the-mill rating.  If you're in Uptown, then try it, but I wouldn't make any special trips."}
{"text":"Staff wasn't very friendly. The place seemed dirty. We had bread served on plates with chewed gum and when we told the waitress, she just put new plates down and left old ones there.  Food wasn't great- I'm from the north and have had better southern cooking than this. The cornbread is good. Over priced a bit. Not awful but there has to be better places with southern home cooking!!"}
{"text":"Great southern cooking.  The blackened pork chops were excellent with mac and cheese and yams.    The service was very friendly but a little iffy.  Our appetizers were delivered after our meals.  Also, we were told they were sold out of our beer, even though we were sitting next to cases of it.    The price was good and worth a visit."}
{"text":"My husband & I went here based on the reviews from here. We were in Charlotte for our anniversary and I was eager to try the local cuisine. I like trying small businesses and supporting them. With that said...Mert's was disappointing and overpriced. The fried chicken was bland, you should not have to put salt on fried chicken. The Mac n cheese and pound cake was ok at best. The fish had bones in it and one got caught in the back of hubby's throat. The greens and yams were ok. The WORST was the red beans; tasted like they were cooked in a caldron of hell. I got peach cobbler and could not eat it because it was disgusting!!! Horrible!!! If I go to a place especially a mom and pop and spend almost $40 for 2 dinners and 2 desserts it should be excellent. I have gone to mom pop shacks spend under $20 and got excellent food like grandma makes. I would not recommend this place and would never go back. I can't believe people like this food. It's too bad I have to leave this review because I love supporting small businesses and especially black operated small businesses. Yuck!"}
{"text":"Wanted to like this place. Staff very friendly. Reasonable prices. Quick service.  But plates were dirty. Table dirty. Food just OK."}
{"text":"Mert's was recommended to us by both visitors to Charlotte and a resident of Charlotte. It felt like a low-key, local spot, which I love. We ordered the fried tomatoes and soul rolls for the appetizers, but they messed up our order and gave us the soul sampler instead. That included a soul roll, corn bread, ribs, and chicken. The tomatoes were good in my opinion but my friend said he'd had better (he lived in Atlanta for several years). For dinner I had the fried catfish and chicken leg quarter, with the mac & cheese and cole slaw on the side. I did not like the cole slaw at all...I think it had pickles in it and that threw off the taste for me. Mac and cheese=awesome. The chicken and catfish were both average...tasty but nothing I would HAVE to return for. We were SO full after it all, but still ordered some cake to go. They have several cake options, including lemon, orange, strawberry, and sweet potato. I went with the sweet potato with cream cheese frosting. Very tasty but not much different than carrot cake minus the raisins & nuts.  Our server was such a sweetheart so that made the experience 4 stars for me!"}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant! Great food, Good Service & friendly atmosphere. I will definitely be coming here again. If you are in North Carolina you need to visit this place :)"}
{"text":"The food was alright and I thought that the portions were a good size. But i think that the service was absolutely terrible. My friend and I walked in and two women at the counter ignored us for a couple minutes, said they would be with us in a second, continued to ignore us until we finally asked if we could just seat ourselves and they just said yes. We then sat ourselves - and waited for about 15 minutes before someone came up and asked if we were going to be eating there. From then on out - the service still was not very good and everything took a long time. The waitress wouldn't even look at us when we were ordering - as if she just did not care. The food definitely does not make up for the terrible service. I will not eat there again."}
{"text":"A must visit when in Charlotte!  Food is fantastic and great location uptown."}
{"text":"I waited for 15 minutes before anyone came and spoke to me. I was displeased in the service. This isn't the first time this happened. The server was not empathetic when I told him my concerns. I will NEVER return!"}
{"text":"Terrible-  The positive was that we were seated promptly but they crammed as many table and chairs into the small space as they possibly could. My poor husband was bumped each time someone walked by. Our waitress was blah and unfriendly, she actually seemed super busy which left us feeling rushed when asking questions about the menu. Our food was nothing to rave about. I ordered salmon cakes and red beans. The salmon cakes were extremely bland while the red beans were overly salty making them inedible. My friend had the catfish which had virtually no seasoning but the serving portion was HUGE, enough for two. The only part of my meal that I thoroughly enjoyed was the cornbread. It was delicious! No second visit for me."}
{"text":"The food took forever to come out and while we waited for around 20-30 minutes in an empty restaurant our waitress only came to visit us once to deliver the corn bread. She never stopped by to tell us that is was going to take some time. But then again it was two veggie plates and chicken tenders.... The food was delicious but the service was bad."}
{"text":"Love the food here! Chicken is soooooo good! The cornbread is yummy! My fave soul food spot in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Amazing customer service and recommendations by the staff.  Food was fast, fresh, and delicious. Next time I'm in Charlotte I will definitely visit and recommend it to my local friends."}
{"text":"My service and food was wonderful. I am from south jersey. The waitress have me great suggestions. Price extremely reasonable!"}
{"text":"Food is good, service started out slow, but got better.  The salmon  cakes are the BOMB, and it's real fish (Not can).  Nice portions of food... Nice outside sitting if it's a nice day."}
{"text":"Had some fried chicken and carolina style pulled pork along with green beans and potatoes. They also had great biscuits. I really liked the pulled pork-- really flavorful and moist, but the fried chicken was mediocre. Especially after reading many great reviews, I was disappointed in the chicken. Really neat atmosphere downtown charlotte."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. The food was absolutely delicious. We had the soul rolls for an appetizer, fried chicken with collard greens and macaroni and cheese, and the Carolina Chopped BBQ with potato salad and macaroni and cheese and it was all great!  The best BBQ I've had in a long time!  Corn bread also came with the meal and it was so good! The service was also fantastic, we loved Latosha!"}
{"text":"I was so glad that they were open on a Sunday night since that was my only night in town. When I arrived it was really busy but they found a table for me right away (table of 1 when it's busy-waitresses nightmare!).  The atmosphere was really relaxed and fun. I was seated close to the food window so it had a great diner feel to the place being so close to the chefs.   I ordered the Fried Catfish based on reading the reviews and looking through the pics and I very much anticipated the arrival of the \"Yelp famous\" cornbread. It did NOT disappoint!!! It was cooked perfect and was moist and fluffy. The sweet butter went quick and I had to ask for more (which they brought right away). The catfish was superb and tasted surprisingly light and the remoulade sauce....I mean come on! It was so tasty! I had the Mac n cheese and green beans as sides and they were fantastic. My dinner with a drink was $17. I wanted to keep eating but alas I couldn't keep up with the southern portions but made a more than valiant effort!  My waitress was working her tail feathers off and was extremely kind and attentive."}
{"text":"Service was extremely slow. We sat at our table for quite a while before we were waited on. Once we ordered the server brought cornbread right away. It's good but, not what I was expecting. We both ordered the fried chicken. It was cold and soggy. The mac and cheese was good but again, it's Mac and cheese. The server was really sweet but not attentive to the table. Food was just ok. Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I can't even. I mean.  I couldn't stop eating. So good.   Friend chicken plate with mashed and green beans with Banana pudding for desert.   Worth every penny."}
{"text":"We loved this place !!! Food was amazing ! I had the fried chicken , Mac and cheese, and okra with tomatoes. I would recommend this place !!"}
{"text":"Such a friendly staff and environment. Food was amazing. I had the shrimp creole as recommended by the waitress. I am so glad I went with it. Absolutely delicious. Also, side note, Chandris was our waitress and she was wonderful. So absolutely sweet. One of the reasons I'll visit Charlotte again for sure."}
{"text":"Unbelievable.  I was in Charlotte on business and was told this was the place.  And wow, they were  right.  Great staff...Great food.  Neat place.  Every visit to Charlotte will include Mert's.  And the corn bread is unbelievable."}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast and food was great. Pretty greasy but I suppose that's southern cooking."}
{"text":"I visited this place during NASCAR weekend. I should have listened to the locals from Charlotte that kept telling us to try another place for soul food. But it was close to the Mariott and we already made plans with another couple to meet there.   Well, the locals were right and my wife's intuition based on bad reviews prevailed.  The waiter began by flirting with my sister in front of her daughter- - we smiled but not appreciated!  The food was substandard at best. I ordered beef ribs that were more fat than meat. And the vegetables just didn't have a clean taste to them.    To add insult to injury they imposed a 20% gratuity for a table of 6!  Trust me this was not a good time and the pizza we ate that night hours after at Zablong was the better choice.  Save your money!"}
{"text":"First let me say FREE PARKING!!!! The food was great the service was excellent the potato salad was just wonderful. The staff was super friendly the atmosphere was perfect."}
{"text":"The food was good but it was very overpriced. $7 for 2 small soul rolls, $8 for 2 small salmon cakes, and $10 for a few beef ribs. The sides were plentiful though."}
{"text":"I've been to Mert's twice.  It looks fun and interesting, and I've heard good things about it...but I have to say that both of my experiences were lackluster.  My biggest problem was the service.  We got the same waitress both times (lucky us).  She was surly and very uninterested in doing her job.  Both times it took a VERY long time for her to even come to the table.  I would understand if she was busy, but there was no \"Hi, how are you?\" or \"Sorry for the wait\" or anything.  Just \"Are you ready to order?\" without even a smile.    Our server also forgot to bring a salad we had ordered.  When the main dishes were dropped off, she dropped it quickly and didn't offer to refill our drinks or ask if we needed anything else.  We had to ask another server for the salad.  We only got a refill on our drinks when she dropped off the check, since she definitely didn't come to check on us during the meal at all.  Honestly some of the worst service I've ever received ANYWHERE.  My husband and I are pretty patient people, but this was ridiculous.  Since it happened twice with her, I have to assume she's normally like that.  Anyway, the food was fine.  Those saying it's the best cornbread ever really need to try more cornbread, especially something homemade.  It was okay.  Fried chicken, chicken tenders, and salmon cakes were also okay.  Nothing to write home about, so I doubt I'll be giving Mert's a third chance.  With \"just decent\" food and lousy service, it's not worth it."}
{"text":"The salmon cakes were unbeatable. I had those, green beans and collard greens. Everything was prepared to perfection. Oh, and the cornbread was so tasty. Our group was super hungry and we were all raving about how good the food was and it was filling. Good value for the money. And the waitress was so sweet and attentive. This has got to be one of the best soul food restaurants anywhere."}
{"text":"First time to this restaurant with immediate seating for a Friday evening.  Great food!  Greens and black eyed peas were the best!  Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Ah Mert's! I love this place! It's not fancy, it's just good. Whenever I am in Charlotte I go to Mert's if I can and I always order the bar-b-cue short ribs. These ribs are different than what I get back in Texas in that they are served entree style instead of your usual \"rack-o'-ribs\". They fall off the bone in a nice sweet BBQ sauce. Very tasty! The sides are always good too. The service is laid back diner style. That being said, the staff is always friendly and every time I have been there the whole room is full of happy people which goes a long way if your feeling like a stranger in town. The prices are what you would expect in a restaurant like this ranging from 6 to 11 dollars per plate. Mert's is real soul food served in a soulful environment so check 'em out! You'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place. Quite a few in my party, however, did not. I got the fried catfish & bbq rib combo with Mac & cheese and collard greens. Everything tasted delicious to me. The fish was tasty and succulent, the ribs were fall of the bone tender. The Mac and cheese was good. The cornbread was yummy. The only thing that disappointed me was the sweet tea, I expected it to be way sweeter than it was. All in all I would definitely dine here again."}
{"text":"We've been on a search to find great southern soul food in Charlotte and this place is definitely at the top of the list so far. The location uptown on College next to the theatre was perfect. The service was excellent. The Perch was perfectly prepared. The baked macaroni and cheese was by far the best I have ever tasted. The Collard Greens, Black Eyed Peas, Cabbage and Oh Oh Oh that Corn Bread. The banana pudding had a surprising cake bottom and perfect texture. The ice tea was perfectly sweetened. The kids loved the chicken strips which looked buttermilk battered and very moist inside. Definitely worth the drive. There is no valet but you can park at the Holiday Inn garage and they will validate you."}
{"text":"The cornbread was good but everything was without season and it was fruit Flys (along with the traps) everywhere! The collard greens had an excessive amount of uncooked onions and tomatoes. I would not recommend this to anyone if you are in the mood for good food."}
{"text":"A group of us from work ordered food to go. Portions are VERY small for the price! The sides come in small cups (see photos). The chicken was good, not spectacular, but decent and juicy... chicken is the only reason for the 2 stars. The wings are not jumbo. Mac and cheese is dry/not cheesy. Black eyed peas weren't seasoned and lacked flavor. Yams were decent. Cabbage undercooked and also under seasoned. And the greens were cooked well not too soggy or mushy but taste like vinegar. The peach CAKE not cobbler was the most disappointing. Almost 5 bucks for a hunk of cake with a handful of tiny ground up CANNED peaches (see photo). They should not in any way describe it as a cobbler and could at least use frozen peaches instead of canned. We almost feel like driving back just to give them this box of peach dough and get our $5 back!! Don't believe the hype!"}
{"text":"Best soul food in Charlotte! Vegetables are flavored deliciously, must go! Great fried catfish and chicken!!"}
{"text":"Found this little Gem just passing through to Savannah GA and what a find it was!  Always looking for the next best thing Me and my little Chicklet stumbled into this eclectic little cafe drenched from the storm that suddenly popped up as we went in started a conversation with 2 strangers so comfortable was the atmosphere the hostess thought we were a group(we had never met) As we were settled into our table the vibe was filled with all the soul you could expect!  But oh how good was the food the corn bread and catfish were to die for but the best thing for me was the good buttered fried cabbage something that makes my mouth water as I think about them. One last thing the server hostess and even kitchen workers made time to speak this was a Top Notch surprise for such a quaint place thanks Chandra you took great care of us! We will return with empty bellies and bring friends. Merts Heart And Soul of Charlotte"}
{"text":"While visiting Charlotte, we wanted a place within walking distance from our hotel, The Hyatt House (fabulous place). We found the perfect restaurant on Yelp and quickly chose Mert's Heart & Soul. I love comfort food so this was my heaven. I had blackened pork chops with collards and mac&cheese. The mac&cheese was so delicious that I almost ordered a second round. My husband had the ribs and fried chicken combo with collards and mashed potatoes. I tasted his and it was yummy too. The cornbread loaves were scrumptious with the sweet butter. So not to be left hungry later when we returned to our hotel, we ordered the soul rolls & smoked turkey with beans & rice plus dessert- coconut cake, banana cake & caramel cake. All of the cakes were moist and full of flavor.  Our waitress, Malika was great! She was funny, attentive and pointed us in the right direction with her recommendations. She made our dinner a complete success. We will definitely be visiting again and asking for Malika when we return."}
{"text":"I went to Mert's with a large group.  We were looking for a great dinner place with local flavor while attending a conference in Charlotte.  Oh. My.  What a great find!  Our table shared a plate of salmon cakes as an appetizer.  They were tasty, crisp yet moist, strong salmon flavor but nicely seasoned.  The remoulade served alongside was incredible.    I ordered the BBQ pulled pork, with mac'n'cheese and home fries as my sides.  The pork was amazing -- quite sweet, with just the right amount of spice.  The mac'n'cheese is DIVINE, creamy and cheesy and carbohydrate love in every bite.  The home fries were alright, but not as outstanding as the pork or mac.  And of course, the cornbread was wonderful, but sweeter than I expected.  The staff and ambience were friendly and welcoming, even for a huge group on a busy evening.  They moved tables around to seat us right away.  I will definitely return to Mert's if I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"I just had the worst restaurant experience ever.... I ordered BBQ pork with Mac and cheese and green beans. First off my green beans came out cold then they came back hot but tasted like they were just sitting in grease. My Mac and cheese was dry and old like I got the bottom of the barrel. I will never step foot in this establishment again. Too bad I wanted to like it. I'll still to Lawan's."}
{"text":"I recommend their salmon cakes Mac n cheese & collard greens! Their cornbread is SO good & their cakes look delicious only problem is I never have room for desert.  I also enjoy the atmosphere- servers have always been friendly & good, awesome place.  When I have friends visit Charlotte who aren't from the south I take them here to get the real deal."}
{"text":"Me and my sister had the salmon patties.My sister had yams as a side that she thought was a little uncooked so she told our waiter that she didn't want them he asked if she wanted anything else in its place and she stated no,but thank you.So the host or whatever she was comes to our table and yells \"SO YOU SAY YOU DIDN'T LIKE THE YAMS,WELL I JUST TASTED THEM AND THEY ARE FINE!!!My sister kindly said well i didn't like them and plus we have different taste.So that host or cook or whatever she was yells \"WELL I DIDN'T SAY NOTHING ABOUT TASTE BUT I DON'T SEE THE PROBLEM BECAUSE WE ALWAYS COOK THEM THE SAME WAY AND NOBODY ELSE HAS COMPLAINED!!!While hitting her hands together!So by this time i was fed up with her,I said \"let me tell you something she said that she didn't like them now  that is that and it shouldn't be a problem and you are out here arguing with a customer making a scene for what,when the customer is always right.She yelled \"NOW THAT'S A LIE THEY ARE NOT ALWAYS RIGHT!I said please leave our table so that we can finish eating because we want be back!Because first of all you have been standing at that counter the whole time before you came over here digging in your teeth while  working around food and you are Rude!!!I will Never eat there Again!!!And the owner owes my sister and I an apology for his/her disrespectful employees!!!"}
{"text":"If you want real soul food, come here. This is not a chain style restaurant, this is Mert's Heart and Soul!! Damn good !!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  There was a time when I ate here twice a week.  The food is amazing and very true to its Gullah/Carolina roots of down-home, Southern cuisine.  Everything is fresh, delicious, and remarkably low-priced."}
{"text":"Tried the shrimp and grits...and the sampler platter and MY GOD, was it delishus. I mean I would not have changed a thing about any of it, there is a reason why the line was out the door! I should have grabbed dessert for my walk home. This place was so good Im willing to eat dinner there every night till I get back home to California"}
{"text":"We were visiting from San Diego and only in town for one day. Someone recommended Mert's for some good soul food.  Exactly what we were looking for!  The fried green tomatoes and the corn bread were absolutely amazing, I'm still craving them.  Our servers name was Jeremy and he made our experience even better.  We asked him to pick us out some of his favorites, and we were in soul food heaven.  If we ever make it back to Charlotte, Mert's will be our first stop!"}
{"text":"Went there with my parents (who are incredible health freaks) but wanted to try southern food, and we all loved it despite (or because off??) all the fried stuff. We ordered a Southern Sampler and a Soul Sampler, and it was perfect for the three of us. Granted we all eat like birds, but literally EVERYTHING was absolutely delicious and very cheap! It was a beautiful day, so we sat outside and had a wonderful dinner with good service."}
{"text":"If you want a tasty soulful brunch on a Saturday morning, Merts is the place to go.  Outdoor seating, pet friendly, and the best fried chicken  in Charlotte!  The organic yellow grits are out of this world good.  I didn't care for their biscuits, but everything else was mouth-watering good!!!   The coconut layer cake is light, fluffy bites of heaven on a fork!!!"}
{"text":"To sum up my recent trip to Mert's...pretty delicious food yet poor customer service. The only fast service was for the drinks and cornbread. Our waiter was very inconsistent and neglecting us. There were at least four tables with more than three customers which received their entrees before my girlfriend and I did. It will be a very long time before I go to Merts again."}
{"text":"This was my first time to Charlotte and I couldn't leave without my helping of down-home cooking [I was born and raised in Va until 10y/o by my Carolina born grandmother who cooked \"soul food\" every day], but been in Jersey now 22 yrs, yet travelled to Va quite frequently most of my life. I know good southern home cookin when I taste it. This was definitely mediocre. The restaurant was crowded as it was a Saturday afternoon and there were many tourist such as myself on this particular day. I always order the same dish whenever I try a new \"soul food\" restaurant for the 1st time to play it safe: fried chicken, greens, yams. Well, the food was ok. That's it. The ambiance was nice though."}
{"text":"Great service and even better soul food. Try the fried green tomatoes, Mac and cheese, collards, catfish and fried chicken."}
{"text":"The first time we ate here the experience was great. The last time (this past Sunday) not so great. The wait staff seemed confused and the service was very slow. The soul rolls are 6.29 and small. Merts could improve by making a larger roll so you can actually see meaty pieces of chicken and collard green etc....On top of that they were burnt around the edges but still delivered to our table with an excuse that they were slammed with a Sunday church rush and having a hard time providing A1 service. When asked to speak to a manager they never arrived, instead sent messages via the server which were clearly not customer focused. Management should be walking around and visiting the customers to make sure the food is good and customers are happy.   I don't know what Guy Fieri was talking about when he said the soul rolls were spectacular...He lied. The cornbread is excellent...I also loved the Mac and cheese and salmon cakes too. Go but don't expect to be blown away by the overall experience"}
{"text":"I am a new resident to the City of Charlotte. In search of some where to have dinner in the uptown area, to celebrate my friends Birthday, we came across this quant  place. bypassing 5star gourmet restaurants we opted to have  a quite dinner with some soul food. The restaurant was interestingly decorated  and the menu was appetizing.  The service on the other hand was not.  I had never tried shrimp and grits before  so I being a special occasion I decided to try something new. when the dish came to the table the presentation was nice however the taste was not satisfactory. it was overloaded with onion and It was not enjoyable to me. So I then asked the waitress if something could be done because I didn't like  the dish. She told me \"I have to get the manager, because I can't change once the food is on the table.\"  I told her that was fine. The manager never came to offer any apologies nor explain what the solution could be. the waitress comes back after like 15mn and says \"She says pick something of the menu and we'll trade it out.\" I then chose the chicken dinner. The waitress nor the food did not come back for almost another 20mn. she then comes to the table not to refill drinks or to apologize for the wait. but to offer to bag up the meal and bring the check. at this point I was embarrassed for bringing my friend to this place and irritated because I was hungry and very annoyed with the service I told her yes please bring the check. she brings a check not only with the meal I changed for but also the initial meal that I did not eat. I was confused asked to speak tho the manager by another waitress. that waitress says sure she's the lady over there in the red shirt.  and walks the other way.  So I then call the manager over to clarify that this was a mistake. she says \"If the owner was here he would not be playing with y'all. He would make you pay for both. I on the other hand will take it off.\" I was floored at the way she spoke to me and the fact that the owner would make a patron pay for something they didn't like. I felt stereo typed and embarrassed that it was my people to treat us this way. So needless to say we will not be returning back to this establishment ever! I hope this is not hospitality in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Like I said before, I can only rate a place by tasting their chicken salad and Mert's chicken salad was AWESOME! The grits was delicious and the omelette serving was perfect (not too big, in other words, the appropriate amount a typical American should eat). For dessert, my friend and I had a slice of sweet potato cake and it tastes very similar to carrot cake - extremely rich and delicious!"}
{"text":"This was my first time coming to this restaurant and I came because a lot people and media were talking about it. I took my Mom on Sunday for her birthday.   The only thing good about our meal was the water, orange juice and corn bread snack. Actually, the OJ was room temperature, so it was 'borderline good'.  I ordered smoked pork chops, home fries and green beans. My Mom order salmon cakes, collard greens and mac-cheese. The pork chops had a good smoke flavor, but they were too salty and paper thin. The fries were over-cooked and soft. The green beans were greasy and tasted sweet. Sometimes, people will add a little sugar to green beans if they accidentally add too much salt; I believe that was the case.  My Mom's salmon cakes were dry, the collard greens were flavorless and under cooked (probably just stir-fried) and the mac-cheese was dry.  Not only was the food bad, but it wasn't even hot and my green beans had a little solid grease on them (eeewwwww!).  I won't go back because the meal was expensive (w/tip), the parking was terrible and the food was no good.  It was a total disappointment for me. I was embarrassed for recommending this restaurant."}
{"text":"So I've been to this place about 6 years ago and wasn't  that impressed with the food. I recently  decided to check them out again since I work upstairs from Merts  and boy oh boy  I'm still not impressed. I ordered a salmon patty  meal and the patties  were  under cook as well as the yams. The mac and cheese was extremely blend, but  surprisingly  the cornbread was  good. I decided to sent the salmon patty back because  it wasn't good and undercooked. The server asked me to scoop them off my plate so she could show the cook proof and asked did I want anything else. I told her chicken wings and not even 60 seconds later she comes with a plate of chicken.  I'm thinking boy  that was fast.  Never again will I eat there again."}
{"text":"Just plain delicious! Those biscuits were on point and the catfish was seasoned to perfection."}
{"text":"If we hadn't found Merts on our last day in town, we would have eaten here everyday. You have to look past the disorganized front desk, where one lady was answering togo orders, taking names, and bussing tables and just enjoy delicious southern soul food. They aren't lying when they say SOUL food. Everything about the place brought warmth to your soul. You can't go wrong with anything you order. & if you need help deciding the waitstaff was helpful in giving suggestions & favorites.   Do not miss Merts."}
{"text":"I read positive and negative reviews but figured I'd give it a shot. Now I know the negative reviews were correct. I had the BBQ Beef Rib (which is actually a Korean short rib), heavily salted fried Whiting, passable potato salad and tasty red beans. Hubby had bland greasy fried (no crunch) chicken wings (should have used some of the salt from the whiting!), cabbage soaked in butter and a fresh but saucer size side salad.  I also don't know what the fuss is about the cornbread. Took my 4 yr old niece to ladies room and she questioned why the floor was so sticky.  It may be good for some but doesn't cut it for me. Did I mention the yams are diabetic sweet..."}
{"text":"So the Mac and cheese tasted terrific! My complaint is that after I ate here for lunch I felt horrifically sick for the remainder of the day and so did my friend. Maybe it's just that I'm not used to eating food with so much butter or grease but I was my feeling great afterwards. I wasn't really a fan of the chicken.   The atmosphere was old school and it has a cool vibe. Good service when we were there too!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Delicious homemade food.  I have been here for breakfast about 5 times.  It is my go to breakfast/brunch spot when in Charlotte.  I always bring friends and they love it as well.  Fresh eggs, delicious mac and cheese, corn bread.  They have always been fine with altering and substituting ingredients, which is always nice.  Servers are super fast and friendly!"}
{"text":"Cool, casual service and the home of probably the best cornbread I have ever had in my LIFE. In my view, you can't go wrong with Mert's. Happy eating!"}
{"text":"Not impressed.   Long wait,  host had us down  for 7 instead of 2 (due to his handwriting) so waited 50 minutes.  Ordered oj, they didn't have it,  charged us for it anyway.   Took forever to be waited on."}
{"text":"Visiting Charlotte and asked for recommendations for Soul food and we were sent to Mert's. And Mert's did not disappoint.   The service was amazing friendly and warm like I was coming to their house. We came at 9pm on a Thursday, it closes at 930pm. But the waiter made sure we knew we didn't have to rush because there was over an hour of cleaning etc to do  Now let's talk about the food. About the amazingness of it.  My girlfriend and I got two different things and shared. I'll list in order our favorites.  1. Collard Greens- they were the best I've ever had. They were just done perfect. 2. Fried Catfish- it was cooked and breaded perfectly.  3. Fried chicken- followed closely by the fried chicken, breaded light but perfectly. Those 3 were my favorite after that the others were good but not as mind blowing.  Solid mac n cheese, yams, okra and cornbread with whipped butter...mmmm.. My girlfriend got the salmon cakes they were the only thing that was a disappointment.  Not bad but they were whatever, we killed everything on the plates except the salmon cakes.   They had a microbrew Carolina Blonde that was a solid beer.   Overall from the service to the food it was a great experience. I'd recommend it for sure."}
{"text":"Had dinner here while in town from LA. Great location; walking distance from hotel. You can smell the wonderful aroma's of home cooked goodness wafting out of the building as you walk up. Interior is decorated in sepia with family photos old and new that lend to the idea that this is a family-owned business proudly serving great home style cooking to the community; a family tradition.   I ordered the fried whiting plate which comes with two sides and cornbread; I got collard greens and macaroni and cheese. My husband ordered the shrimp and grits with a side of yams. My fish was hot and crispy just like I like and well seasoned. I added hot sauce (Cholula) which added just the right zing. The greens were cooked perfectly (taste and texture) and the mac n'cheese was good (not great). My husband enjoyed his shrimp and grits and gobbled one of my whiting fillets to go with. He got a side order of grits later because there was so much gravy on his dish. He said the addition made it perfect.  I kept taking spoonfuls of his grits because they were so deliciously prepared. I'm a snob when it comes to grits and Mert's does it right! The hubs never got his yams and the waitress did not protest when he brought it to her attention and asked to take it off the bill. We were full anyway. She seemed distracted the entire visit. I'd definitely return; thinking about a shrimp po'boy sandwich with a side of greens and yams before heading to the airport."}
{"text":"Cornbread and Sweet Tea. If that was all you ate here you would already know how good the food can be. The fried chicken and the shrimp and grits are their signature items and always satisfying. You also cannot go wrong with the daily special, particularly if there is \"dressing\" involved. The standard sides are generally good. I really like the macroni and cheese--super creamy and cheesy with baked crusty topping. Just be aware that many of their sides are made with lard, so vegetarians might want to skip this place.  The service is good, and the food comes out quickly. There can be a long wait if you get there right at noon, so get there early or late if you're planning on lunch at Mert's."}
{"text":"People keep suggesting macs speed shop and finally someone said try merts. Our sever Nia was a doll. Very helpful w menu choices. Their cornbread is to DIE for. As are there ribs. My pork chop was a little dry but still quite tasty! Love you NIA!!!"}
{"text":"We came with high expectations but all the meat based entrees were highly disappointing. The beef ribs portion was tiny, the ribs were not tender and were slather in a way too sweet sauce not a well balanced BBQ sauce. My husband had fried chicken which was pretty stale and hard. The cornbread, rice and mac and cheese were all great but the main southern fare we traveled far to try were not appetizing at all. Do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Very good- the best cornbread period.  Mac and cheese  is excellent!  I had veggie plate with spinach, too cabbage  these were fab!  Nothing I've eaten here was bad.  Keep on LIVIN!!! This place is terrific!"}
{"text":"One whiff of the food outside and you are ready to get on the inside.  Their food is off the chain!  Had chicken wings and collard greens.  Food for the soul.....um um good!  Red velvet cake again honey?  Oh well, let's head in for milk and cake.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"We got in late from out of town, and placed a Postmates order for Mert's just 10 minutes before they closed.  I know, I know . . . . Anyway, everything came through perfectly, and it was an amazing meal.  4 thumbs up from this household!"}
{"text":"After moving out of Charlotte, Merts is one of the things I've found that I miss the most. The owners and staff are true examples of southern hospitality, and the food is to die for. Their fried chicken is amazing, collard greens are heavenly (only second-best to my mother's), and without-a-doubt the best cornbread you'll ever eat. The only thing you don't want is their barbecue (its really not at all like traditional NC barbecue). Prices are reasonable and there's rarely a wait. Ambiance is kind of like a dive, but everything is clean. If you've never been you must go!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. It's hard for me to find something I want without changing a million things around, but Mert's had plenty of choices for me just the way they came. Even if I wanted to be picky, the waitress was more than happy to accommodate and she was on top of her game. Love Mert's and have to go back soon!"}
{"text":"The 2 times I've been in Charlotte, I have visited Mert's Heart & Soul.  It is a very fun environment that is rich with history, the food is extraordinary southern cooking, & the service is very hospitable!  I would definitely recommend for anyone & everyone in Charlotte to check it out.  I can't wait until my next visit!"}
{"text":"I'm writing this review as a pat on the back for the service at Mert's. The food there is awesome as reflected in other reviews & we've certainly never been disappointed. What's even better than their food though, is the wonderful service. From the time you walk in the door, you feel as if you are a guest at someone's house as opposed to a customer. They bend over backwards to bring you whatever you need and sometimes even anticipate what you may be needing before you get the chance to ask!  I highly recommend Mert's!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best good I ever had. Period. And the prices... How do they turn a profit? I don't get it. But I'm just visiting from New York."}
{"text":"My friend and I were driving from DC and finally made it to Charlotte. We've never been to Charlotte, North Carolina and was craving some serious Southern food. We came in and it was really busy. I ordered the fried chicken breast with sides of collard greens and mac and cheese and my friend ordered the Whiting poboy. The collard greens reminds me of Vietnamese mustard and greens and was so good. That is probably the best friend chicken I've ever had. The skin was flavorful and the meat was juicy and tender. Many times friend chicken comes out really dry, but not at Mert's. Of course I completed my Southern meal with some sweet tea."}
{"text":"Food was good but not spectacular. I was not impressed with their mac n cheese which is usually a good way to make me happy. The fried green tomatoes were tasty though. The type of service you get depends on how busy they are. Almost always ridiculously busy (standing room only) because of their location."}
{"text":"We got take out beef ribs last night.  Yummy!!   I am visiting from TX and a native NYCer.  So I have had my share of bbq.   This was quite tasty.   No one complained about the taste of the food.   But everyone complained about the portions.   For 12 bucks you get a few beef short ribs.   Don't expect to get filled.   Satisfied...yes.  But not satiated.    The location is nice.  The decor is fitting.  They had a TV blaring which would affect a conversation....though it could also stimulate one or save a bad date. My mom is a new believer and a local here and she is planning on getting food from here now."}
{"text":"Best food in Charlotte. You have a horrible sense of taste if you don't like this place. Get the Chicken and Ribs."}
{"text":"I don't even like cornbread and I LOVED it. Not even sure why I tried it other than the fact that I was starving and it smelled like sweet corn and butter. YUM ME!  Get the fried chicken finger dinner. I MURDERED the chicken and it may seriously have been THE best fried chicken (outside of grandmama's fried chicken) ever. VERY WELL-SEASONED.  I almost lost it when I tried the BBQ sauce. Obviously homemade. I couldn't believe this place put so much talent and effort into EVERYTHING.  Macaroni and cheese was good, not great. But I ate it all so that says something.  The only thing I couldn't finish were the yams. TOO sweet for my liking. They don't call em candied yams cuz they taste like vegetables I guess.  Find your life at Mert's.  And the staff was SOOOOOOO attentive. Doesn't get any better especially with patio seating in the heart of Uptown!"}
{"text":"Mert's is awesome! I'm visiting from out of town for work and a local took me here for lunch. Hands down my favorite meal in Charlotte, and about 1/4 the price of other places in the area.  I had the salmon cakes which were awesome-- great salmon flavor with cajun kick. The cornbread was tasty and kind of cake-like, mac 'n' cheese was delicious with a nice baked top, and the collard greens were good too.  Will definitely be back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Let me tell you...they don't care if you loyal, royal or 'oyal.  We \"tried\" to call in a to-go order 20 darn minutes ago, to take to my mother 75 miles away.  The owners fam picked up the phone and kept us on hold then HUNG UP (total 20 min).  I wanted to go in and just see if they would have good customer service, when I explained what happened.  H-to-tha-Naw.  The \"fam\" told us it would be another 20 minutes.  I told \"them\" we had been on the phone waiting when \"they\" hung up - so the question is...do we have to continue to wait b/c of bad service.   She sneered and then I..um..no...it will still be 20 more minutes - with no apologies.  So, some managers, personnel, are not concerned with local, repeat customers or just doing the right thing.  The disrespect and disregard exhibited stung - as though I was not a paying customer willing to compensate for what I ordered.  Deuces and Done!  (Gotta make g-d mac and cheez now smh)"}
{"text":"Good food, bad service. Our table of 5 received an immediate table upon arrival. Once seated, we waited 10 minutes before a server came to greet us and offer drinks. Service continued to go down hill. Server (Shanice) did not tell us about the daily specials, but we overheard another server explaining them to another table. Food took a RIDICULOUS about of time to come out. Our server seemed to be occupied with doing everything BUT bringing our food. We had to ask for refills. Then should only brought a refill for one person. When it was time to pay, we asked for separate checks. One person decided to pay for another persons check and the server wanted to go back and combine them because she said she was too confused. Therefore she ran back and forth EACH time to run our credit cards. Inefficient and a lot of time was wasted. As we walked toward the door, the server chases us down and says she forgot to charge us for a side of dessert. For real?! Needless to say, I won't be back. I prefer a restaurant that provides GREAT food and GREAT SERVICE. Too many other choices. My money is worth it."}
{"text":"Great place to experience home cooked style southern food. Yams are delicious along with salmon fish cakes and sweet potato cake for dessert"}
{"text":"Not only was the food wonderful but the staff are friendly.  The ribs are sooooo tender and the red beans & rice are fabulous.  The cornbread is YummmmmY."}
{"text":"Id give 2 1/2 stars. I really want this place to do well...Salmon cakes black and hard on one side? No thanks. I wanted to send it back but decided against it and ate it anyway. I liked the cornbread and mashed potatoes. Greens were ok. I ate here once before and was very disappointed with the fried chicken...thought I'd give it another try now months later. Server was nice but the food was just ok. Also after having real shrimp and grits in Charleston...popcorn shrimp and grits is not gonna cut it. Hope the chef/cooks can make some changes for the better. Otherwise I'll just get cornbread and sides to go."}
{"text":"I was in Charlotte for 5 days a few years ago. I managed to get 6 meals at Mert's. If they'd been open for breakfast during the week, I'd have had 8 meals there."}
{"text":"We were in Charlotte for a basketball game and to celebrate my son's 20th birthday party.  We were a party of four and  a friend recommended Mert's.  It is not a very huge place at all and it was jammed packed when we got there but we sat almost immediately.  The decor is really cool and service is warm and friend from the time you walkj through the door.  The food is very good!  Not the place you want to go if you are on a strict diet because just about EVERYTHING is fried or fattening but this is the place you go to when you are off the diet wagon lol. They do have salads if you can stand to eat that healthy while your friends and family eat fried catfish and cornbread  :)  We loved the Soul RolIs as an Appetizer.  I had the blackened Salmon which was just okay for me. I was looking for more blackened seasoning for a little kick of spice, but it was ok.  My sweetie is a Lousiana man so he had okra and tomatoe, Shrimp creole and fried catfish. He is a better cook than me believe it or not and he said Mert's did a good job.  He loved it. My sons had fried fish french fries collards.   I loved the flavor of the greens  and I am a good cook so I can throw down on some collards. Mert's did the greens some justice for sure!   My family thoroughly enjoyed their meals and the cornbread and everyone left quite  full!  The prices are VERY affordable so even those on a very tight budget could go here.  and we had a wonderful, attentive and funny waitress named Paris!!!!    I would definitely go back (when I'm off the diet wagon) and would recommend this place to anyone who likes soul food!"}
{"text":"YUMMY Soul Food in my tummy!   I love Mert's! Me and my family come here quite often. We have been for brunch and for dinner. The service is OK but the food makes up for it. The cornbread is excellent that comes out before the meal and it always seems to get gone quickly. The fried chicken is excellent and the salmon cakes are yummy as well. Especially with the sauce they give you on the side. The beef ribs were too saucy but tender. If you have to try an appetizer, try the soul rolls! They are sooo good!   The price is decent, not too expensive. Location is great but the place gets packed and its not much seating. Definitely worth the wait if you are patient enough to. Mert's is one of the best soul food places in town!"}
{"text":"Mert's is Fantastic!  I have only been once, but the chicken was out of this world!!! Very cool atmosphere as well and frendly staff :) I will definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"Good ole southern food  MOST of the staff is awesome its like seeing an old friend with a famaliar face.. great cakes and pies and the chicken is what I live for..! Merts has an amazing down home southerm charm feeling.. it can drown out all the excitement of center city with its cool southern down home meets the city vibe..  dones sometimes smell like grease but I still love it!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant seemed perfect online but when I went there  it was totally different experience.  As soon as stepped a foot in the restaurant I was in the face with bad smell which was combination of old frid fosh and burnt oil. This smell will stick to you for four to five  hours at least. The corn bread was the only good thing in the restaurant.  I ordered chicken wings which was cold and \"rubbery\". My friend ordered po-boy chicken  tenders tge bread was old and hard consequendly  he couldn't eat his sandwich."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place. The restaurant itself has so much personality from all the little knick knacks and pictures decorating the walls and shelves. The food is amazing! I love soul food and they do great soul food here! Everything we had was delicious! The fried chicken, bbq chicken, mashed potatoes, Mac n cheese, jambalaya, freshly baked cornbread, and the good sized slice of chocolate cake. It was one of the most amazing dinners I have ever had. I don't go to Charlotte much but the next time I go, I know I'll be going there for sure!"}
{"text":"If this is great Southern Food then I am a craw dad .  The Okra was not fresh and rather tasteless , the fish special wasn't fresh and was small and the cabbage was mushy.  I was married to a Mobile girl and this is not what I expected for Soul Food.. But it was cheap and the corn bread was excellent."}
{"text":"Perhaps it was just an off night, but my meal was horrible. They did seem slightly rushed because of the crowd and that's the only reason they get two stars. I ordered the shrimp creole and catfish combo with macaroni and cheese and yams.   The catfish was not the 'whole' catfish that the menu proclaimed-- it was a filet. The macaroni and cheese was not southern home style but reminiscent of Panera's. My yams consisted of four small pieces of sweet potatoe in heavy syrup. It was literally gone in two bites. The creole over flavored rice wasn't even worthy of a second bite. It was left untouched for the rest of the meal.   Totally unsatisfied with this dining experience."}
{"text":"Food was just ok, nothing special. Had home cooked food way better than this. Isn't a place I would go out of my way to get food from and definitely not worth the hype.  I ordered the salmon cakes with Mac & cheese and yams. The yams were suppose to be candied yams but were very bland. I actually had to add my own brown sugar and cinnamon to get the taste to my liking. The mac and cheese was ok but the cornbread was the best thing I got in my meal"}
{"text":"Great food & atmosphere! Catfish was perfect! Tried several apps and entrees and no disappointments."}
{"text":"The best cornbread in the world hands down. The shrimp po boy was done exactly as it should be and the mac and cheese was perfect.... oh and the waitress lato'sha was AWESOME...."}
{"text":"I wish I could give half stars because I'd truly rate Mert's as a 3.5 (or even 3.75) out of  5. But to be fair, I will round up to 4.   I have been to Mert's four times in the past year and have been pleased with each visit. The service and ambiance is great. The art and music promotes an inviting warm home-style environment.  I'm only giving this place 3.5 stars because of the food. It is tasty, but not the best southern cuisine I've had. I was raised on southern cooking and am aware of variations in seasoning and techniques for one location to another. However, although good, the food does not satisfy my appetite when I'm in the mood for \"soul food\" or southern cooking. I'm sure this varies from one person to the next. So, try it out yourself!   :)  Also, I've had the catfish and chicken here, but my favorite meat at Mert's is the ribs."}
{"text":"Food is awesome...Service is horrible.  I've been here many times and I keep coming back because of the awesome food.  However, every time I get a waitress who is short, no patience, in a hurry and just down right rude.  I've made up my mind that from now on, it will either be a plate to go or no tip for a sorry waitress.  If you can handle bad service then go cause the food is mouth watering."}
{"text":"I usually don't write reviews, but I just had to because of one person. My husband and I went to Mert's this past Monday, and had the best waiter that we have had anywhere, in a long time (and we eat out often). His name was Sam. Sam was attentive, courteous, funny, and just an all around great guy. I looked around and he was the same with everyone. I had a not so good experience at Mert's a few months ago, and didn't think I would be back. I am glad we gave it another shot, though. The food was delicious (chicken tenders Winston-Salem style, mac and cheese, and yams)... and as I said, the service was great, thanks to Sam! We will return."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Great price, great service, and awesome food.  The cornbread alone is worth the trip.   I also loved their fried chicken.  It's a bit noisy but that's because it is is full of happy diners.  Perfect spot for some casual Southern cooking."}
{"text":"On a trip to Charlotte, my friends and I needed a restaurant to taste the essence of real down south food.  We happened to be staying blocks from Merts and hoped this would be a positive hit on our travels in NC. BINGO....It was.  We first walked through the door  and the hostess was so friendly and pleasant.  I guess she was the poster child for \"Southern Hospitality.\" The place is warm and looks fairly new, but there are pictures all over the wall of different types of people and autographed posters of actors/actresses from Broadway plays from over the years.   We ate around 11AM on Saturday, breakfast was still available, as well as lunch items. I opted for lunch items because it had catfish and I am a sucker for catfish from soul food restaurants.  My boyfriend got a breakfast platter and my other friends got fried chicken and salmon cakes.  The catfish was seasoned to perfection.  If it wasn't for the fact that they give you the entire fish, including the tail and bones, I would have ate every single piece of that fish.  However, the fish did fall off the bone easily, but its a mental thing for me.  I did receive mac n cheese with it, which was good as well.  The salmon cakes were good as well.  I did not taste the large portions of fried chicken, but my friend did say it was very good.  Didn't taste the breakfast either, but the plate was squeaky clean after 5 minutes.  They have desserts, but we were so full by the time we ate half of our meals that we couldn't even fathom another bite.  But I would love to go there to have their banana pudding or lemon cake again.  We tried to go there again on Monday {Labor Day} but it was closed.  I am now trying to move to Charlotte and this restaurant would easily be a Sunday Dinner spot for me."}
{"text":"OMG! SOOOOO good!! The only place I have had better collards is at my mothers house :) Amazing!"}
{"text":"The best part of the meal was the corn bread. I came from Philadelphia to try this place because I'm a foodie and I like to travel and spend money on food. The worst of the worst Mac nasty taste like Chinese buffet Mac, green were big and not washed lacked flavor, ribs were chewy and had no sauce this place just overall disappointed. This is only a place non African Americans would love"}
{"text":"The presentation of my food was not appealing. I think the server almost lost control of my plate before I got to the table. The macaroni and cheese and collard greens were good but I felt the salmon cakes taste disgusting. I have had better."}
{"text":"was visting charollett and came to merts and order catfish wit mac and potatoes salad also a vegetable platter food was horrible im from louisiana that fish and food was a assault horrible please don't visit merts go to midnights !!!!!!!!!!!!!of you want dog food this is the place. if you want soul food this not the place !!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ, I don't know much about \"soul food\" but the beef BBQ ribs were awesome and served with Mac and cheese plus red beans. service was very fast and friendly. I love the EAT sign in front."}
{"text":"This place is completely awesome. We were visiting from out of town and hadn't had good Southern food in over a year. So glad we found this place this past weekend (Sunday brunch/lunch). We knew it would be a good place when we saw how busy it was and that number of CLT PD was eating here - officers always seem to find the best local spots. It was amazing. I took one look at the menu and was like \"Yes, please\" - I'll take it all. There were 5 of us and we all had  a difficult time deciding. So, we each ordered a variety of things and shared.  The eggs were a litle greasier than I like, but were still good. Pork chops were outstanding - I loved the spices on them. Shrimp and grits were right on. Sweet potato pancakes  were solid - and that's saying something since I don't usually like them. The meat lovers omelette was cooked perfectly as was the BBQ omelette. One user commented that the country ham was too salty, but I didn't find that was the case at all. I grew up having that every Sunday and it brought back those memories. The fried chicken wasn't as good as my granny used to make (seriously, who's is?)  but. it was very very good.   The biscuits and cornbread were simply amazing - my mouth is watering thinking about that fresh hot cornbread. Absolutely loved it.  Sweet tea about put us in coma - straight sugar; just like it should be!  Service was hectic (place was packed) and could have been more timely to take order, but very friendly, food came out spot on hot and correctly. Drinks were refreshed without having to chase anyone down.  Price/value makes this a great place."}
{"text":"The first time we came here the food was excellent.  However, on my second visit we had terrible service. Our meat was burnt. The mac and cheese and cornbread was all we ate. It took 45 minutes for our food to be brought out to us. A couple that sat down and ordered well after us received their food 15 mins prior to us getting ours. We were not pleased and will definitely not be visiting this restaurant again."}
{"text":"I've never bothered to write a review before today, but I have to say how wonderful our experience was at Mert's Heart and Soul.   My cousin and I are in town for Speed Week and we wanted something authentic and local.  We looked at other reviews on Yelp and found this place.  It was blazing hot outside and so the sweet tea was our first special treat.  After that we had a wonderful tasting menu of freshly made cornbread, soul rolls, fried chicken, Carolina style chopped bbq pork, mac and cheese, mashed potatoes and gravy, collard greens, red beans, and last but not least homemade banana pudding.  OH MY LORD, it was all so delicious and served by the most friendly folks around.   LOVE LOVE LOVE"}
{"text":"We arrived in Charlotte and I was told I had to eat at Mert's.  The line outside said.. you have to eat at Mert's.  Well...okay... I get it.  I have to eat at Mert's.  So I did.  And well.  It was just okay.  Maybe it is the best soul food in the area, but I didn't leave thinking, this was some freaking fantastic food.  Decent food, but not great food.  Don't get me wrong.  You will get good portions, good soul food and a good location if downtown is where you want to be.    Décor: 3 out of 5 Food:  3 out of 5 Drinks:  ? out of 5 Service: 4 out of 5 Cleanliness:  4 out of 5"}
{"text":"I love this little place. I went in there because it was next to the hotel I was staying at. I was very pleasantly surprised by the helpful staff and delicious and affordable food. The waitress gave me great recommendations and was very friendly.  I had the salmon cake which was so moist and flavor. Their homemade sauce added even more flavor to the already flavorful salmon cake (I just couldn't get enough of it). The vinegary collard greens had diced onion/tomato sprinkled on top. The corn bread was fluffy and sweet, and on the more moist side (although I have had better - in Boston's Oyster's House to be specific). The Okra & tomatoes was good, but I guess I'm just not a fan of the flavor of Okra, so I would have to say that was my least favorate item of my meal. The entire dinner was just over 10 bucks. Now my stomach is full and happy :)!"}
{"text":"The cornbread was a 10/10! The greens were soft and flavorful. The smoked pork chops I had were amazing. The Mac and cheese wasn't on point for me, but I am a very hard sell on Mac and cheese. It was good none the less though!"}
{"text":"Lived in Charlotte for almost 2 years, work uptown and almost missed this jewel!  Ate here for dinner tonight after work and it was fantastic.  Husband had the fried chicken and I had the blackened salmon.  Sides were okra and tomatoes, rice and steamed cabbage, which my husband raved about (he cleaned the bowl before even trying anything else).  The sweet tea and amazing cornbread recipes could only come from someone fortunate enough to be born in the south-would of made my grandmother proud.  The only thing better than the food (if that's possible) is the service.  From hostess to waitress (Darlene), it was the definition of southern hospitality.  You will miss out if you don't try this place!"}
{"text":"This place was AWESOME. Greatest service and food. I see people talking about service being a problem, but this certainly wasn't the case with our trip there. Had the fried chicken- the yams and the Mac and cheese were TO DIE FOR. And the waitress we had was absolutely amazing and went out of her way to get us tourist suggestions. Best place to eat."}
{"text":"Excellent service for a group of 15. I had the ribs, mac and cheese and collards. All great. They brought out a sampler of the desserts. Banana pudding and strawberry cake stood out, but everything was tasty. At least two parking decks nearby."}
{"text":"Love love love-shall I say again-love love love this place! I have enjoyed most of everything I have tried and at home atmosphere. More Groupon specials please!!!"}
{"text":"As excited as I was to experience the \"best soul food in Charlotte\" I was very disappointed in my experience at Mert's. My family traveled 6 hours from Washington, D.C. To Charlotte yesterday to help a friend move and heard great things about Mert's. When we arrived we were asked to wait outside while our table was being prepared. There were 13 of us so that wasn't a surprise but the place was only half full so it seemed unnecessary. ONE HOUR LATER we checked back with the hostess who hadnt BEGUN to prepare our table because she was busy with her friends and what appeared to be her newborn baby. We were seated and enjoyed our waiter. The food was another story. My husband ordered shrimp creole and I got the fried catfish and fried leg quarter with seasoned rice and Mac and cheese. I will say that the fried catfish was smaller than expected yet delicious but I felt that EVERYTHING ELSE was terrible. The rice was well over cooked and tasted like the bottom on the pan was scraped to get rid of it and my Mac and cheese was burned. The shrimp creole tasted like shrimp covered with tomato sauce on top of the same old dry rice. Overall I really wanted my experience to be as good as others have told me but even my sister in law who recommended the place was surprised at how bad her food was. I really wish it was just a bad night but first impressions are lasting in this case."}
{"text":"Would never go back!  I was in a party of 3 that was seated at a table for 4, and was then asked if we could move to accommodate another group.  Okay, not a big deal.  However, it all went down hill from there.  Our waitress was nice and polite, but we waited for close to an hour and still nothing showed up at our table.  The people that were sitting at our original table had been served and had already left.  We asked our waitress a number of times why we weren't getting our food, and she kept apologizing and saying \"it's on it's way.\"  But it never came.  It wasn't like we ordered anything unusual, it was eggs, sausage and toast.  The whole thing was weird because others were getting served, and their food was arriving at their table.  Finally, we just said thanks, but no thanks and left."}
{"text":"Are you hungry? Need to get some real savory food on your belly? Want to spend your money at a family owned restaurant? Go to  Mert's Heart and Soul. Save room for dessert too! We are visiting Charlotte and on the hunt for lunch downtown, yelpers you are the Best. You said this place was good and that's the truth.  We ordered the red beans and rice, the lunch special, smoked pork chop, and the ribs appetizer. All were delicious.  We had iced tea for our beverages and peach cobbler for dessert. Samantha took care of us and is an ambassador for the establishment. She suggested we return and I said Thanksgiving time. Well, she said the owner closes the place on Thanksgiving day to serve the homeless. Well I can only say this. I'm happy I had lunch there and if you try it I believe you will to."}
{"text":"What a disappointment!  My first day in Charlotte and I had checked Yelp reviews to plan my meals.  The only good thing I can say is service was friendly and the cornbread was good.   However, that wasn't enough to even warrant a second star because the rest of my food was so unpleasant.  I started with the soul rolls, but thought the mixture of flavors and textures did not harmonize well.  It seemed to be a fried app just for the sake of being fried.  But without the pleasing crunch I expected. But the real let down was my shrimp and grits.  What they served me was a bowl of lumpy grits (one particular lump was too big for my spoon to handle) swimming in a truly awful brown mess.  The color made me think the sauce might be rich, but it was the opposite.  I could probably recreate the flavor with water, thickener and food color - that is just how tasteless it was.  The shrimp had a strange texture that made me think it came from a can.  Then someone had chopped raw green onion and stirred it in.  That was it.  No seasoning.  No flavor."}
{"text":"Effing delicious!  Corn bread is amazing...comes w food.  Chopped BBQ and red been rice were both equally good eats!  Oh, service was spot on!"}
{"text":"Mert's deserves all of the love it is getting and more. I visit every few months for their awesome beef ribs, mac and cheese, and collard greens (I'm a collard fanatic, and these may be my favorite anywhere - and they are veg!). Lots of other good stuff on the menu as well - Soul Rolls, Chicken Tenders, Salmon Cakes, to name a few - but the ribs are hard to pass up. What really puts my love for Mert's over the top though is the ownership and the consistently good service. Last night, we visited, and although both Mother's Day and JCSU graduation meant they were packed, we were seated quickly, served promptly, and left happy. It was not the only time we have been impressed with the friendliness of everyone at Mert's!"}
{"text":"I checked yelp for southern food while in Charlotte and ended up eating here 3 days in a row. Had great service each visit and great food.  The Collard Greens are the best anywhere.  Everything else I tried was good.. I couldn't believe how much  salmon was in the Salmon Cakes, they were loaded.  Cornbread is mighty tasty as well.   The macaroni and cheese is tasty, but super buttery,  a little rich for me.   Prices are super reasonable, most of my meals were about $10 with tax and tip."}
{"text":"No thank you! I've never been a \"one and done\" person when it comes to a restaurant but this place will be the first. It's unfortunate because I will be in the area 2+ days a week indefinitely and dining out every meal.  We got the soul food sampler, I got the whiting with yams & mac n cheese, my husband got BBQ ribs with red beans & mashed potatoes w/gravy. The waiter had trouble remembering our order (read above) to the point that he had us repeat it for the 3rd time as he entered it in the computer. The entrees came out before the appetizer. The portions are huge but nothing had any flavor. For Heaven's sake, you couldn't even taste the cheese in the mac!! There were quite a few bones in the whiting FILLET. $42 plus tip later, we left with our leftovers in tow. I tried eating it tonight for dinner but felt myself getting angrier with each bite so I trashed it. Nothing about this is food for your soul!"}
{"text":"Food was fantastic!  The soul rolls are amazing.  The service was some of the best service I have received.  The environment was relaxing and filled with lots of laughter."}
{"text":"I place a to go order for a vegetable plate. I ordered mac and cheese, cabbage and candied yams. My first complaint is why did it not come in a to-go box, for if I needed to warm it up later. They place the 3 individual sides in separate little foil bowls and squeezed then in a round foil pain. I got their all the employees just hanging around acting unprofessional. I wasn't greeted, wasn't asked if I needed anything else or thanked for giving them my business. The cabbage was bland not seasoned at all and the mac and cheese is definitely made with Aldi store brand cheese, I made the mistake of making baked macaroni with it,  it's horrible. I think I will stick to Floyds and  Kings Kitchen. This most definitely make me miss Simmons restaurant."}
{"text":"UMM, UMM GOOD! I had to say that in capital letters just to get my point across how good Mert's is! I've been to a few soul food restaurants, where they claim \"everything is homemade\" but when it comes to Mert's that's exactly what you get! Homemade biscuits and even ..are you ready for this? Homemade butter!! The beef ribs fall off the bone and the mac n cheese is the real deal, no boxed stuff here!   The desserts, what do you choose when you have a choice of German Chocolate, Red Velvet, Sweet Potato, Coconut Cake, Pound cake, Banana Pudding, along with Peach, Apple, & Blueberry Cobblers! The prices are reasonable, they also serve breakfast on Sat. & Sum morns which is awesome is well!  Robin the waitress is a joy to have while visiting!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here after walking around Uptown. I ordered the BBQ pork and she got the fried chicken. When the meals came out, it was kind of different for me. The BBQ pork was the smallest part of the meal and served in a tiny plate and was more like a soup than what I am used to for BBQ around North Carolina. Kind of expensive for what you got. My wife said hers was kind of plain and she didn't seem too thrilled with her dish either when it was all said and done. I personally thought the server we had was kind of rude. No personality whatsoever. I wouldn't make a point to ever stop back in based on the experience we had."}
{"text":"Awesome fried chicken.  I really wanted to go to Price's but since the conference I was attending ended pretty late, I had to get my chicken fix somewhere else and ended up at Mert's.  I got there around 8 and found the restaurant to be somewhat empty.  Rather than eating there, I decided I would have a better time eating back at my hotel since there wasn't much going on at the restaurant.  It wasn't until on the walk back I realized that the steam from the hot foods probably softened up the fried chicken!  I was prepared to be disappointed...  BUT the amazing thing was that the chicken leg quarter that I ordered was not only juicy, but the skin had somehow retain much of it's crispiness.  As I start to gnaw into the fried chicken, with each bite I was amazed at how flavorful it is.  Didn't need any sauce or anything, it was tasty as is.  Like I mentioned, the chicken is juicy.  Dark meat is always the way to go for me for fried chicken!  With the fried chicken, I also got to choose two sides, so I went for the yams and mac & cheese.  Lots of spices for the yams, and I like how it still retained its chunky form.  As for the mac & cheese, I only liked the part where the cheese had caramelized.  Not too special to me.  It also comes with this awesome cornbread and softened sweet butter.  Cornbread + butter is seriously one of the best combos.  I know butter is good with a lot of things, but when you have a tasty cornbread, butter just enhances it so well!  Even with it steaming in its own heat for around 10 minutes as I walked back to the hotel, the chicken was still awesome.  I can only imagine how great it would've been if I ate there!"}
{"text":"Want some authentic Southern soul food without having to drive out of the city into the lands of banjos, buck teeth, and other shockingly accurate stereotypes?  Then Mert's is the place for you!  I would aim to come here for breakfast or brunch, but be forewarned, the wait can be quite long.  Also, don't eat Mert's before a day of outdoor activities or extensive traveling, the heavy nature of the food makes it most conducive to a sedentary timeframe (or overall lifestyle).  When we were there, they were out of a myriad of items (OJ, country ham, other breakfast staples), but they more than made up for it with smiles and service.  However, my Yelp rating schematics do not currently allow for smiles to compensate the country ham shaped hole in my life, thus minus one star.  Still check them out though, maybe even practice a few y'alls while your there!"}
{"text":"Food was good.  Service was ok.  We had dinner before the NKOTB concert so it was pretty seamless.  Price are fabulous compared to bay area.  A full soulful meal for under 10 bucks.  I'm a fan for sure."}
{"text":"That was just about the most amazing comfort food I have ever had. The corn bread was sweet, warm and served with soft butter... I had the beef stew on a bed of the most wonderful rice ever. For a side I chose yams... which came with a sweet sauce, perfect for dipping the corn bread in... And for dessert... sweet potato cake with cream cheese frosting.  The service was super friendly, and the atmosphere low key and warm.  This place is a treat... I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Got there on a Friday night close to 10 pm. We were promptly seated and the waitress arrived to take our drink orders. Everything looked good on the menu and after a couple of minutes we ordered. Our party of three all ordered the same thing, fried chicken, mac and cheese and collared greens. No lie, our food was out to us in less than 5 minutes! We dug in and it was Ahh-mazing!!! The fried chicken was flavorful and crispy but not greasy! The mac and cheese was superb and the collards were on another level! All of this for around 12 bucks made it all the more better! I will definitely be back at Merts every time I am in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch when you're craving soul food in the Queen City.  I came here with a coworker for lunch, and had the fried shrimp po boy and macaroni and cheese.  Runs for about $7ish dollars.  The mac and cheese was okay, nothing special, and the po boy was exactly what you would expect it to be.  The cornbread is good, but for some reason I still prefer Boston Market's..... ha.  All in all it was a satisfying lunch, but nothing that I would go crazy over."}
{"text":"3.5 I would definitely return for the salmon cakes and corn bread. The service was good, parking plentiful in nearby decks, and wall art enjoyable. Based on our meal, I'd skip the black-eyed peas (sort of pasty) and pork chops (dry and thin). But try the salmon cakes!"}
{"text":"Fried catfish is the best I have EVERRRRR had!! The people that work here are the nicest people you will ever meet and are VERY accommodating to their customers. I was craving some grits but didn't want the meal with the shrimp and stuff in the grits...just plain grits with butter. They made me a separate bowl to accompany my catfish and collard greens and it was the best meal I ever had in North Carolina!! Will definitely be coming back when I am in town."}
{"text":"The 1 star is not for the food but for the service. The food was good today but the service was horrible which seems to be unfortunately consistent with other reviews.  First, the waiter was not attentive and rather rude.  He took our orders correctly but when the food was brought to the table, my boyfriend's order was not correct.  We know he wrote down the correct order because he read it back to us.  Evidently, the cooking staff made the error; however, we deal with the waiter and not the cooking staff so the waiter has the responsibility to make sure the customer is happy with the service.  My boyfriend ordered a catfish and chicken combo with an extra piece of catfish and I ordered a catfish and BBQ combo.  The waiter brought us my order which was correct.  My boyfriend got a BBQ and chicken as opposed to the catfish and chicken that he ordered. He told the waiter to just bring the extra piece of catfish and don't worry about the mess up; however the waiter took the whole plate back. My boyfriend waited a whole 20 minutes and did not receive his correct order.  I was done eating and he still hadn't received his food.  The waiter never came to check on us, refill drinks, update us on the status of his food, etc. By this time, we were ready to go so we told the waiter to bring us the check and to take my boyfriend's order off because he never received his food. The waiter did not apologize or anything for the crappy service.  He just dropped the bill on the table and left. We asked to speak to a manager.  After 10 minutes, a waitress came over and said that the Manager was really busy and that she'd help us with our issue.  In short, we never talked the Manager, we just paid out bill and left. Very unprofessional establishment and we don't plan on going back anytime. My boyfriend ended up getting food from Caribbean Hut where the service was excellent."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat! The people there are so nice and the food is fantastic. They have some of the best cornbread I've had and the catfish and chicken are fried to golden perfection but deliciously moist."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!! I had the catfish, Mac and cheese, cabbage! Loved it. My mom also had the banana pudding cake! Amazing"}
{"text":"I'm in Charlotte for spring break in search of famed southern cuisine. I decided to try this place given its proximity to my current location and prior Yelp reviews. I'm deeply disappointed my fellow Yelpers. Before I complain I will begin with my list of Pros (short list): 1. The server was efficient yet aloof. 2. The food was served in record time (by   dine-in restaurant standards-7 minutes. 3. The restaurant was clean and well maintained.  While all of the aforementioned are integral to a good dining experience I think most would agree that the food should top the list. Not so much here.  I ordered the barbeque ribs based on the server's recommendation. Bad idea. For essentially $15 (including tax) you are given one rib cut into five pieces. The rib (s) were overcooked in some places, comprised of fat and gristle, and were both and tasteless. The side dishes followed suit. It was a very disappointing $45 lunch that I traveled 3000 miles to eat."}
{"text":"Food was good, came out fast, and good service.  Some of the dishes stood out more than others, but if ever in the neighborhood again, would come back to try out some other dishes.  The location was right in downtown, but there was no problem finding on-street parking on a week night around dinner time.    We ordered the Soul Sampler, the Southern Sampler, and a side of collard greens, and some sweet tea.  I liked their sweet tea, with the perfect amount of sweetness.  The corn bread lives up to the hype, it had a nice crusty outside and soft inside, and came with soft butter with just a hint of sweetness.  As for the Soul sampler - I didnt care of the \"soul rolls\" (they were like eggrolls with collard greens inside), and the ribs were not your normal ribs (lots of tendons in the meat), but the buttermilk chicken was crispy outside and very tender inside.  As for the Southern sampler - the salmon cakes were flavorful, I liked them, though my hubby thought they were too soggy.  Nothing remarkable about the chicken wings or the fried green tomatoes.  FYI - it seems like each sampler, only comes with 1 piece of cornbread, so if you need more for your party, you may need to order additional as sides. As for the collard greens, the portion was plentiful, but it was too vinegary for my taste."}
{"text":"This place was amazing the cornbread was so good the sampler platter was good too and I added a side of Collar greens which had to much vinegar in them and to many stems. It had a great atmosphere and service was fast and they were very nice."}
{"text":"I liked the atmosphere but the food was WAY too salty.  Just didn't care for it."}
{"text":"Really tasty food, though the two servers I interacted with had a bit of an attitude.  Highly recommend the fried catfish, green beans, and mac & cheese.  Skip the collard greens - all I tasted was sour liquid and bitterness.  The cornbread was pretty dry; not sure what all the fuss is about there.  All the layer cakes on display looked amazing; I tasted the banana bread cake with cream cheese frosting and it was great.  I'd definitely come back if I'm ever in Charlotte again."}
{"text":"I consider myself a bit of a soul food afficianado.  I've dined in soul food joints as far as Sylvia's in Harlem to Mary's in Mobile to Rosco's in LA.  Mert's is up there with the very best in soul food if the lunch I had was indicative.  The fried chicken was perfect!  Crispy batter (not too thick!) and juicy meat even on the breast.  The black-eyed peas were wonderful.  Perfect texture and smoky flavor.    The Mac and Cheese was not the best I've ever had but mac and cheese is a bit like sex.  Even bad mac and cheese is pretty good.  Also, friendly efficient service (I had an early lunch) and great decor make this a big win!"}
{"text":"Delicious and well worth the struggle trying to find the place! Somehow our order was lost and it took over 40 minutes for our food to arrive.... the manager was going to discount our bill but the waiter covered it all to apologize. We had the soul rolls and salmon cakes - would recommend both!"}
{"text":"This was my first time in NC and my friend wanted company to try this spot out. It was a bit hard to locate, so we parked the car in the vicinity and decided to foot it. The decor was bright and inviting. I like the open space feel of the place. The staff were nice and very helpful.  By the time we reached, it was almost closing time, but they still let us in. And boy was the food to die for. I ordered the BBQ ribs and mac and cheese and sweet tea. How did I forget the cornbread, moist with the right amount of butter.  This is the best damn soul food ever!! They really put their foot in this food. I ate slow and enjoyed morsel of my meal. I cant wait to get back to NC and get some more of Mert's."}
{"text":"Food was great. Chicken tenders that I ordered for the kids was awesome. Southern fried chicks was real good too."}
{"text":"Mert's Heart and Soul is a small restaurant in Charlotte NC.  It was originally featured on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives and after eating there I can see why.  The food was genuine southern cooking and everything my family and I ordered was very good.  The staff was friendly although busy and service was a little slow.  The bathrooms could use an upgrade but the restaurant was clean and had an interesting atmosphere.  I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Best low country food. This place did it right.  Sides were made so well and the meats were insane.  Cornbread sweet as the tea. Loved it."}
{"text":"Awesome. I probabley gained five pounds at lunch, but it was totally worth it. Best collard greens ever! Everything we had was good yams, green beans, corn bread, barbecue, fried chicken, corn bread. Yum, Yum. Yum. Plus, the service was friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Delicious Southern food!  The cornbread was so good. I got BBQ Beef Ribs, with Mac & Cheese, Collard Greens, and Yams. The ribs were full of yummy NC vinegary flavor, the mac was cheesy and good, the collard greens were tangy and flavorful, and the yams were savory and sweet. For my first dinner in Charlotte, I was def satisfied.  Prices are decent, and the service is good.  Parking can be a little tough. My best suggestion would be to park in one of the nearby structures, bc there really isn't street parking."}
{"text":"I am so sorry to rate Mert's so poorly but after the treatment received today I must admit to extreme disappointment in one of my previously favorite Charlotte establishments.  After being invited repeatedly via automated email marketing, I decided to go with a group of friends to celebrate my birthday with lunch at Mert's.  After the most interesting discussion (!) with manager (?) I discovered that I did not have the necessary \"proof\" to rate the birthday \"deal\" in spite of having a valid NC driver license clearly showing my date of birth.  In today's economy, I was stunned that any food establishment would take such a tack with a good paying customer!  No worries on seeing my dollars at Mert's ever again.  To many restaurants want my patronage. -cheers"}
{"text":"Love this place...frequent here less since our favorite server isnt here anymore. But anyway...Always get the same thing when I come...stopped here before the Bad Boy concert. Ate outside...like the new tables and chairs out there. Outside friendly, colorful, and no wobbling! Wasn't told the specials...bummer. I found out via their fb post after I left for the evening. I even mentioned to our server that I was looking to try something different, but she just said take your time..."}
{"text":"I might move to Charlotte just so I can eat here every week. Both the atmosphere and food is excellent. Superb low country cuisine! I wanted to eat everything on the menu and nearly did. I ate the lamb chops - unbelievable! Mac and cheese was very good. The desserts just about killed me but I could not pass on them since I knew I was leaving town the next day. If you are anywhere near Charlotte you have to visit this place."}
{"text":"Brought my brother here for a birthday lunch.  The food reminds you of the way 'Big momma and dem' cooked it.  The mac & cheese was divine.  The collards- amazing.  Soul roll- like nothing you've had before..."}
{"text":"Food here is gasp inducing. Some of the best soul food I've ever had. Even vegetarians will be pleased with the veggie sides platter. Collard greens off the hook. Candied acorn squash beats anything you ever had for Thanksgiving. Cheesy cauliflower was a bit underdone for my taste, still raw. Famous for their coconut cake, though after their huge slab of cornbread, you might need to hit the gym. Busy place for lunch, allow time. Service reflects the down home hospitality and warmth you'd want from a place selling comfort food. Come and feed your soul!"}
{"text":"Great food and service!  Had the salmon, collard greens and chocolate/chocolate cake.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  It had cool old wood signs and their original menu on a chalkboard, and friendly welcoming staff.  The menu has a lot of good sounding items, but the problem for me was I was expecting some good Southern cookin with chicken fried chicken or chicken fried steak.  So, I went for the fried chicken breast and it was just blah, dry and no flavor.  The saving grace which earned the extra star was that the side veggies were good and the cornbread was delicious."}
{"text":"This is my downtown spot in Charlotte!  Never been disappointed as I have been here breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  The service is fast, the staff friendly, and the food delicious and plentiful.  It's on College Street right past the Holiday Inn. It's not tucked away but you can miss it if you're not paying attention (you should look for the \"EAT\" sign).  Once you're in there the environment is very laid back. The music is old school soul so you'll be singing and most conversations stops once the food is on the table.  For me when I'm downtown I always make it a habit to go there and as long S they're open I will."}
{"text":"Cornbread!!!!  Merts has the best in town.  We love Merts. If you like southern style cooking this is the place to go. Everything we have eaten here was delicious including the pork chops, fried chicken (watch out Prices) and I love the collard greens. Merts is also in a great spot if you are going to Time Warner arena uptown as it is right around the corner. Please check it out some time."}
{"text":"Below average across the board. I've been twice because I believe in second chances. But I came to the same conclusion."}
{"text":"1st time in N. Carolina recommended by guy at hotel. Everything was weirdly great, even the beans. BBq ribs were incredible! that mert's sauce i licked every drop from my plate. We came back twice. Crabcakes were amazing with that remoulade sauce!!! First time bread was hot and fresh and soooo good, second it wasnt as fresh. Even coffee was good. The butter was good, slightly sweet. Blackened pork chops was good and spicy also."}
{"text":"Another big soul food spot downtown. If you are looking for chicken, ribs, and other down south delights you are in the right place. The restaurant Is on the small side so there is usually await. But the cornbread is defiantly worth the wait outside if the door. I usually get the fried chicken wings and Mac and cheese.  Good spot to grab dinner, casual, will fill you up."}
{"text":"Delicious..tried pork chops bbq cube steak potatoes gravy mac cheese....collards and green beans...all great !!!!!"}
{"text":"Would it be inapporpriate for me to bring in a miniture sized crown and place it on an order of their mac n cheese? I hope not because I really think Mert's has the best mac n cheese in Charlotte! Creamy, cheesey, comforting, their mac n cheese has it all! I haven't been to Mert's in a couple of years but ventured in this past wk and it was just as good as I remembered it .   Solid place for a down home lunch and the prices are pretty cheap. I used to get their pulled pork but this last time I saw the server bring out their BLT to another table and food envy hit immediately! Never would I order a BLT at a restaurant but when you put the BLT on a focaccia bread, I am all over that bad boy. Pair that up with the mac n cheese and I could only finish half of my sandwich and walked out with a tab less than $7. Next time I'll be saving room for their red velvet cake or banana cream pudding-totally worth clogging my arteries over!"}
{"text":"the lamb chop is perfect! and also bbq rib. salmon cake is good, but i wish i ordered the other two!!!"}
{"text":"In my opinion EPIC FAIL ...... I'm from Charlotte and my first time going there was last week and boy was i not impressed. I guess when soul food come to my mind i think of greatness because I'm from the south, it could be a lot better."}
{"text":"Extremely tasty food.  I inhaled my plate of salmon cakes, mac and cheese and mashed potatoes.  The cornbread was tasty and buttery.  The service was fast and friendly, the sweet tea was syrupy sweet and the interior is very entertaining. My sister enjoyed a dessert - was it sweet potato cake?  Something that seemed a bit odd to me. As far as uptown southern goes, I'd say Mert's is your spot for casual, friendly, quick but still very tasty - a nice place to hang out with friends.  King's is better for dressy and classy."}
{"text":"FFFFANNNNNTAASSSTICCC!!!  Wow, are all of the restaurants in Charlotte like this?  Very, very busy, but we were able to get seated within 30 minutes or so.  Waitress was great.  I ordered the shrimp and grits.  Came in a bowl with two delicious pieces of bread.  Ate every last piece.  Delicious!!  Shared the chocolate cake for dessert.  What a find!  To the woman on the flight from Atlanta to Charlotte, I say \"thank you so much.\"  Can't wait to come back to Charlotte for vacation."}
{"text":"I had the fried catfish and BBQ ribs with a side of Mac and collard greens. Everything was absolutely delicious, can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Stopped by after 8 in a Wednesday with my fiancee who is a police officer in uptown Charlotte. Police Officers usually know where to eat and he said Merts came highly recommended.  Neither of us had been here before but we will DEFINITELY return.    The cornbread is fantastic and deserves the rave reviews it gets on here.  The crab cakes are delicious and a steal at under $10.  My date's chicken tenders were really something and the homemade blue cheese dressing was some of the best I've  had in a long time. The collards have a great flavor and are meatless which is a plus for vegetarians.  The yams are a MUST have as a side.  This is one of the most satisfying meals I've had in Charlotte and add it to a very reasonable bill...under $25 for both which is unheard of in Uptown, you just can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Hospitality is AMAZING!!! Visiting from California and this group of people here are all gems... The food Bomb!!! I seriously recommend this to any first timers... So happy we found this place!!!! You will not be disappointed!!!! :) Grits on point!!!"}
{"text":"This place was incredible. At my table we had yams, collard greens, Mac and cheese, steamed cabbbage, fried chicken, southern rolls, BBQ beef ribs and fried catfish. And I cannot forget the INCREDIBLE cornbread. Literally every single one of these things was so freaking good! Service was great. People were nice. Cool little spot to walk around too."}
{"text":"Amazing every time.  Service can be a little slow, and some of the servers are spacey, but they are nice every time.  And my girl Paris ALWAYS is outstanding.  The cornbread is like cake; that's a good thing.  Fried chicken is always tasty.  It's what you expect.  Soul food.  Better/worse than yo momma's, depending on what kinda skillz yo momma had.  Definitely best soul food in Charlotte.  White, black, asian, or whoever, soul food knows no boundaries; everybody should be able to appreciate fried, fatty, buttery, greasy goodness."}
{"text":"Definitely the best Mac N Cheese in Charlotte! Really great staff and fun atmosphere. Other than that, pretty typical soul food.   Nothing to write home about on the other menu items that would make it stand out from similar establishments.   Great spot for locals, but if you are visiting there are much better options to try while you are here."}
{"text":"I'm writing this as I sit here, completely stuffed, after a fabulous brunch. I had the brunch special - - cinnamon roll pancakes - and OH MY! They were delicious! The fella had the same but added the combo sides of eggs, grits and bacon. We went back and forth over whether to do home fries or grits so our very excellent server, Latosha, brought both. Bacon came out crispy (as requested) and the home fries were a cross between french fries and a breakfast food.  Service is friendly and attentive without being obtrusive. Price is a bit steep but well worth it. I am trying to figure out how I can make this a weekly event!"}
{"text":"Mert's is true southern soul food.  Not the New American type, but the real stuff.  Mac-n-cheese, green beans cooked in animal fat, salmon cakes, fried chicken.  It's all good.  I love the mac-n-cheese and will often just order a veggie plate where I can pick 4 different ones to eat.  They always have vegetable specials so I can try something new every time I go.    They also had 4 different hot sauces on the table.  I made a point to sample them all on the delicious corn bread they make."}
{"text":"I'm definitley a fan of \"Mert's Heart & Soul\"  I had the pleasure of dining here for brunch this past Saturday.  The moment I walked through the door I knew I was in for a treat.    We were waited on by Gerilynn and she was excellent.  She was able to answer all of our questions about the menu choices. She made suggestions the saved us money and elevated our experience. I orderd eggs, toast, grits, pork chop and city ham.  It's a simple order but it was prepared perfectly.   The decor is so fitting for a soul food restaurant.  There is so much to see and hear, every old school soul/R&B hit makes you want to get up and dance.  I could sit at the counter listen to the music, and drink coffee every morning If I lived near Mert's."}
{"text":"What a great find in Charlotte! Mert's Heart and Soul is just that- a little bit of food love in the city.   We went for brunch on a Saturday afternoon. As we pushed open the door- we were greeted by Robin who quickly seated us, took note of my lack of accent and asked where I was from, and got us going with some great cornbread and butter as we sipped our beers and looked over the menu.   Breakfast? Lunch? Breakfast? Lunch? Well breakfast won out but only by a fraction of a point as the southern fried chicken and mashed potatoes and green beans were definitely calling to me.   But I went with the omelet with ham and cheese and a side of buttermilk pancakes. My dining companion went with the eggs and country ham (ooh- that is some salty ham!) Both were served with a side of home fries. The food was great. But the service was even better.   Robin took great care of us, making sure we had everything we needed and told me I just \"had to try\" the cornbread so she brought that out as well. Loved the music- Sam Cooke, and Sam and Dave played through our entire breakfast adding to the ambiance.   This is not a fancy place. But one that serves up good food, with friendly service and reasonable prices. Breakfast for two with drinks ran about $34. Definitely on my list to go back to the next time I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"First time in Charlotte and i absolutely love soul food (must be the 'soul' in me lol). Anyways a uber driver schooled me to a soul food place right in the heart of downtown charlotte called merts.  And it did not disappoint.  You walk in and it reminds you of being in someones home with a plethora of memorabilia etc on the walls.  It can come across as cluttered but i think it contributes to the authenticity of the place.   The food is aboslutely delicious, with me even going twice and ordering completely different things to ensure the consistency of the food and flavors.  I will definitely be going back and you should too!"}
{"text":"Food was slow. Not so impressed with the breakfast items. The macaroni and cheese was very good.  I really did dig the decor, very hip looking place. Management should  definitely work on getting food out faster."}
{"text":"If you ever read my reviews you will quickly lead I am an avid lover of all things soul food. So I had to give Mert's a try. Definitely enjoyed my side dishes. They were everything I hoped they'd be. My main protein wasn't what I had hoped for.   I ordered the catfish with candied yams and green beans. I also had a sweet tea as well. I personally like my catfish more on the crunchy side and this was the exact opposite. Had a decent flavor but myself and my dinner date both agreed we have had better.   The location is cute it's kinda in the downtown area of the city and the drive in was a nice scenic route. I did enjoy that. I wouldn't have mind parking far and strolling on down to the restaurant vs driving. We snagged a good parking spot luckily because street parking is limited. If you like sides like me you'll love theirs. Give them a try if you are in town. My had no real complaints about his food and he is a big foodie too."}
{"text":"I had a veggie dish. It was okay,  the potato salad had too much mustard. Yams and greens was okay."}
{"text":"Mamma better slap me, because I just sinned...   Let me explain, I just got spoiled, I was rewarded with delicious food, and I didn't do anything to deserve it.  You heard me, landed in Charlotte and after checking into my hotel, I decided to B-Line it to Mert's; because there was a need in me to have some good food, and I got delicious food.    First let me comment on the service... it was genuinely amazing.  I was promptly seated, and the hospitality was refreshing.  The server helped me patiently figure out what was good, and we settled on Southern Fried Chicken, Collard Greens and Mac & Cheese.  The Cornbread came out first, and it was mildly sweet, and tasty.   Let's break down the meal.  Fried Chicken:  From the moment I took my first bite of the chicken breast, it was perfect cooked, juicy and hot, the meat was lightly battered, and the batter that was on it, was seasoned well.  It was a one of the better pieces of friend chicken I have had, not dry at all.   I would eat this every day, if I lived here, and I didn't have to worry about eating fried foods.  Recommendation, eat it, yum.   Collard Greens:  I've had collard greens before, and this was good as most.  Admittedly, never had it with tomato before, but it was still delicious.  I liked the flavor, and the greens were tender, soft but with a nice bite.  The portion of the side was right, and complemented the chicken right.  Mac and Cheese: Yes Sir, this stuff was creamy, delicious, sauce done with tons of cheese flavor.  It was cooked right, because you don't see any sauce/oil separation.  In fact, all you do is taste the various textures, from the small clumps of cheese, to the noodles which are just cooked past al dente, but not much after.  It's like creamy goodness, yummy heaven, sometimes, I think you can make Mac and Cheese just the entire meal.   Here we go, I love good food... but like a good infomercial... THERE'S MORE!  What in the world is a Sweet Potato Cake?  That's lovely stuff, I had some, and it's like a tasty and the cream cheese frosting was amazing.  I think they spiked it, crazy amazing, not overly sweet, the texture was nice, and it melts in the mouth.  Here's the kicker; I ate all the food and this doesn't really happen much, but it was perfect portion.  I'm 6'1, about 225lbs, and I thought all this southern comfort food would leave me heavy; but nope, it was just the right amount, and all for 15 dollars, with a coke.    Like many other Yelpers, KICK ASS food. Location isn't easy to find at first, but you want food, and you are in downtown, make this a perfect spot, for you and all your friends."}
{"text":"This was our first time eating here and we'll definitely be back. The potato salad and mac and cheese are better than mine that I make from scratch. I had a bite of my husbands red beans and yum! I can't wait to go back! Everything is homemade."}
{"text":"Service was super fast. No wait. Didn't take forever for my fried green tomatoes to come out. They were not worth the $7 I paid for the 4 slices of overbattered tomato I received.   I guess I'm glad I tried it ??  Won't be going again or recommending."}
{"text":"Of all the wonderful places to eat in Charlotte, this place was an instant favorite.  It has a down to earth type feel.    The food was something else.   I've never had southern food, but as this was my first experience with it, I have to say I ow understand what all the hype is about.  After eating at this place you'll understand the meaning of \"Soul Food\".  Salmon cakes,corn bread, deep fried catfish, home-made butter, mac and cheese, okra and tomatoes...the stgoes on.   My mouth is watering just reminiscing about it.  The guy who waited on us was more than just a waiter.  He was friendly, funny, prompt, courteous, and attentive.  Carmela...thank you so much for taking me to this place! I had itis for the rest of the afternoon!"}
{"text":"Went there for late lunch. I guess since they did not have my favorite, bbq pork ribs, I decided to eat healthy and ordered grilled salmon. The salmon was good, but I did not like the creole sauce on it. I had already finished off the cornbread which was served first, and it was fantastic and a pretty good size.  The Mac and cheese was good but on the dry side but I liked that it had pieces of the browned crusty top.  The string beans were inedible and looked and tasted just like canned beans, though afterward, the waitress said they were not canned. She asked why I had not asked for something else since I did not eat them, and I said I wasn't sure I would be able to eat anything else as the cornbread had been so filling.  Maybe I ordered the wrong things but would not rush back there."}
{"text":"The food was delicious.  Salmon cakes, shrimp creole and catfish, and of course fried green tomatoes were amazing!  So was the okra.  We can't wait to visit again. The only reason we couldn't give it 5 stars was the service.  It could have been better."}
{"text":"OMG!  Best southern food ever.  Staff is always friendly and efficient.  My colleague and I are in Charlotte together for business at least once a year and this is always on our list of must visit restaurants.   Just like at home some of the side dishes aren't consistent. For example last year the red beans were so-so, but this year they were the best. The only exception to this is the black eyed peas. They are always AWESOME!!!  I don't even like collard greens that much but I'll share a serving from Mert's.   Fried chicken always done just right, salmon cakes tasty and slightly spicy. The remoulade sauce is a killer. It's even good on the chicken.   Portions are very generous and prices are reasonable.   Too bad I'm never here over the weekend for their Sat & Sun breakfast.  I'd love to try it.   This is not health food but it is soul food that is healthy for the soul!"}
{"text":"After taking the Charlotte Symphony audition and being heartlessly cast out in the first round, a friend and I set up camp at Mert's for some good ole fashioned commiserating.  It's ideally located right across the street from the theater, so as waves of depressed looking cellists streamed out once per hour, we were able to bring in some more friends to eat and drink our sorrows away.  We sat out on the patio as it was a lovely spring day, and stuffed ourselves with the great food here.  I had the fried tilapia (special of the day) with greens and yams.  It was great, flavorful and well proportioned.  My friend had the fried chicken with mac and cheese and he was raving about it too.  To polish off the meal we split some sort of caramely cake that was heavenly.  They have a bunch of great looking cakes on the counter inside, and I only hope to come back to Charlotte soon to try another!  Service was very friendly.  Great experience overall."}
{"text":"Went there MLK weekend.  Fried chicken was scrumptious and the collard greens were authentic and just down right lip smacking delicious! Not too salty, good balance of flavor, spice and acid. Nice beautiful leaves which proved it was made with fresh greens! It's a diamond in the rough.  The black eyed peas and cornbread were very good too.  I think the whipped butter made the cornbread sing.  The fresh peach cobble was yummy and that's the way to end a good ole fashion soul food meal.  The ambiance was down home local with some fantastic soul and R&B playing in the background. If you're about the food, then this is a great place to patronize."}
{"text":"I had always heard good things about Mert's and was pleasantly surprised to see that they opened up at 9 a.m. on Saturdays and Sundays for brunch when most Charlotte restaurants don't open for brunch until 10 a.m.  I figured brunch would be a good introduction to Mert's and also allow us to try another brunch place that opened earlier.  We were seated and received excellent service from our server.  Unfortunately, the brunch/breakfast options seemed very limited and their taste was just average.  We crossed Mert's off our list as a feasible brunch option II wouldn't recommend it for this time of day) but may return to give their lunch or dinner a try.  I do love a good fried catfish!"}
{"text":"Tried this place again after a long time. It is overrated and hit or miss. I got the beef ribs and fried chicken. Got 2 very small bones with all fat on it. The chicken was ok. Greasy green beans and tarty potato salad. Staff not on point with things this evening. Maybe because it is a weekday. This place needs to get better. I will try again in 3 months."}
{"text":"Brief summary of our experience.  Service sucked ass big time!!  If it was purely based on service alone, it would have gotten a 1 star or 0 stars!!!  If review was based on food alone, it would have gotten 4 stars.  I decided to compromise and give them 3 stars.    Our sour dining experience starts and ends with Sharon, our waitress.  Bottom line, she was very rude and she needs to be FIRED!!!  After we were seated, took about 5 minutes before she approached our table.  She then gave us 2 straws and did not even bother to greet us or introduce herself to us.  Then she turned her back to us before we could say anything and continued to flirt with the 2 guys in the table to the right of us.  We didn't even get a chance to ask for water.  About another 5 minutes goes by and finally we can order.  She takes our orders but throughout the entire time, we did not have her full attention, her mind was at that table!  After our orders were placed, we got our cornbread BUT she did not give us ANY utensils to eat it with.  I asked another waitress for utensils and she said she would get it for us, but she never did.  Basically, we weren't her table so she didn't want to help Sharon out.  I guess no camaraderie at this workplace.  In the meantime while we were waiting for our utensils, a party of 2 sat to the table to the left of us and they encountered the same issues with her.  They too were served their salad and cornbread without utensils.  We all had to wait at least 5 minutes if not more.  The only good thing about waiting was the table with the 2 guys to the right of us paid and left.  Now I thought she could focus more on us.  I was wrong!!    She brings us our main dishes, fried chicken quarter and fried catfish with our sides being, mac & cheese, yams, okra with tomatoes, and collard greens.  We also ordered an appetizer and I couldn't believe our main dishes came BEFORE the appetizer.  In the end, we just took the appetizer off the bill because we finished out main courses and the appetizer never came in the interim.  Anyways, we STILL did not have our utensils.  I was pissed!!  We waited anywhere between 5-10 minutes before our utensils finally arrived.  By that time, out food was somewhat cold.  We ate our food ASAP and got the hell out of there!!  If you ever come here, don't get waited by her.  Another thing that irked me, a part of 3 ladies sat in the table to the right of us and she was definitely more friendly to them.  I won't speculate about anything but bottom line, she is a terrible waitress (definitely the bottom tier).  As for the food.  LOVED the fried chicken.  Batter wasn't thick at all.  Light and crispy and chicken was moist and tender.  The fried catfish was good as well.  Lightly battered and fried.  As for the sides, I personally do not like tomatoes and onions with my collard greens.  I prefer the smoke flavored ham collard greens.  If you like the sour/tart collar greens, then this is a place where you can get them.  The candid yams were good, but definitely not the best.  I couldn't put my taste buds on it, but the sugar they use is a little different and it doesn't seem that they used a lot of butter.  The mac & cheese was just okay, I prefer more than once type of cheese in my mac & cheese =P  (i'm just spoiled)  As for the food, I would recommend this place and I would come here again.  When we paid for our bill at the cashier's desk, that lady even knew that we received sub-par service.  She made some jokes to make us feel better about our dining experience.  I applaud her effort but what she needs to do is get rid of that waitress."}
{"text":"Bad service from server Shante. Salmon patties just ok. Fried whiting delicious. Corn bread delicious."}
{"text":"We went here while in downtown Charlotte.  It was pretty good soul food.  I had fried chicken, mac and cheese, and mashed potatoes, however the cornbread they brought the whole table was the best thing I had.  Our waitress was very nice and accommodating.  Eating outside was nice as well.  It was very affordable for a downtown spot too.  If you are looking for some good home cooking in the city, you should check out Mert's."}
{"text":"I had the blackened porkchop, Mac n cheese and sweet potato.  Their corn bread is complimentary and was dynamite!  The entire meal was sweetened a bit, the pork chop was smoky, slightly thin, blackened with seasoning and warm in temp.   Mac n cheese was pasta with shredded cheese clumped into the pasta and looked different was tasked great.  The sweet potatoes were brown sugary goodness.  The staff was great and service was impeccable!"}
{"text":"If you're idea of the best meal in the world includes cornbread, sprint, don't walk to Mert's. Best cornbread ever.  Side note: I was in Charlotte for 3 days, and at least 5 people asked my (twin) brother and I if we were twins. This never happens in the Midwest or Northeast. One of the women working hit on his pretty hard. That was fun."}
{"text":"Such amazing soul food! Seriously some of the best collard greens ever! It's a shame that such awesome food can be disappointed by such horrible service! We waited for over an hour for an omelette and a vegetable plate! The waitress could have cared less that we had to wait. Our drinks stayed empty for most of the meal and it took 20 minutes and repeated requests for a small packet of mustard! We are from out of town and had heard such amazing things about this place! Once again, great food but super horrible service! Not sure, due to the service, that we will return the next time we are in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Merts...... if you see a lighted sign on the street that spells out EAT; then you have found Merts. A very very good authentic soul food restaurant in the heart of Charlotte's uptown area.  When you walk in you know you have hit the soul food jackpot by not only the aromatic fragrance of the food, but visually seeing the pitchers of homemade lemonade and ice tea throughout the establishment, the chef in the open view kitchen working on the next best meal.....YOURS! Just reminds you of grand ma's kitchen on early Sunday afternoons.  Now to the food; there was much to choose from but I decided on the fried jumbo( and they were) wings, black eye peas, and an excellent cabbage. My wife enjoyed the sampler with salmon cake, truly delicious baked mac and cheese, and a (soul roll)egg roll with diced chicken, collards,onions, black eye peas, rice and served with a spicy honey mustard sauce. DELISH.   The service was great, the staff very accommodating, There are many other dishes to try, I guess I'll have to go back a few more times! I can't wait."}
{"text":"Came by for dinner before the ball game tonight.  The very good: soul roll appetizer, sides including black eye peas, mac 'n cheese, yams, collards, and lemon cake dessert.  The good: cut bbq pork (says my brother).  The meh: The cornbread wasn't sweet enough for me, but my brother enjoyed it.  My salmon cakes entree was very bland. Even Texas Pete couldn't save them.  The service - took ~10 min for someone to get our drink order and our waitress was not attentive. Plates weren't cleared until the end of the meal, so I had to keep stacking 'em.  The bad: waitress double charged me for the meal. I found out after the meal as I was walking back to the hotel - thank you credit card notification! - and had to walk back and hash it out with the manager. To her the charge disappeared a couple of hrs later.  In summary: probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Best place to get comfort/soul food. Te wait staff is always friendly and the dishes, especially the cornbread is delicious."}
{"text":"Melt in your mouth cornbread. Soul rolls that make you want to testify. Down home friendly service. Shrimp and Grits that make you smile. Great food close to downtown."}
{"text":"I have been here three times now and I can say there are reasons to go, and reasons to skip.    Ambience/Service =  First the decor is very eclectic and interesting.   However the floors feel a little slippery/greasy.   I have read mixed reviews regarding the service.   I haven't had incredible service each time but I would say more positive than negative.     Food = The salmon cakes and soul rolls were very good.  I would definitely recommend those two appetizers,  as appetizers or as your main dish.  The fried whitening fish was very good.  The fried chicken was just okay.  I have had a lot of fried chicken I would recommend over theirs.  The cabbage and yam sides were good as well.  The only thing I will skip next time is the fried chicken.   Really,  Mertz's deserves more than three stars, but also, I couldn't quite it four stars."}
{"text":"Mert's was amazing!  I had the fried chicken, mac'n'cheese and collards - good sized servings at really good prices!  My boyfriend got the beef ribs, mashed potatoes and mac'n'cheese.... everything was delicious!  The waitress we had was on point!  She was friendly, energetic and extremely fast!  I will be going back!!!"}
{"text":"So I've been waiting for forever to eat here because my expectations were high since I saw it on Diners, Dive Ins & Drives... But boy oh boy was I completely disappointed in my meal! We should've just went some where else.   This is how it went...  I ordered a sweet tea and we eventually ordered the soul rolls. The sweet tea wasn't sweet AT ALL and we never ended up getting the soul roll but of course when the bill came it was on there. Yes they removed it. So our entrees came...   My boyfriend ordered the salmon creole with cabbage and a garden salad. The salad was brought out first and literally looked like they just took a small handful of salad straight out the bag and threw it on the plate. The salmon was two THIN piece and he said it didn't taste fresh at all. The \"creole\" sauce looked like tomato sauce poured over the fish and was so bland!! He wasn't satisfied at all.   So my meal was the beef ribs with macaroni and cheese and cabbage. I got my tea switched to a lemonade which they say is made there. It was okay. I make better lemonade at home. But the beef ribs were okay and so were the side. It was just okay nothing special AT ALL! I didn't order a dessert.   We both left full but totally unsatisfied. The menu was very very small. It's safe to say we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Well--after I was done, and I didn't finish half my plate I decided not to take home the rest and wished I didn't eat the calories I ate the catfish wasn't worth it. I decided to give them one last try on a slice of pound cake to take home with me. It was wrapped up in Saran wrap and put in a box when i opened it, the texture was dry and hard, and it wasn't big enough to charge almost $4...  there were flies everywhere. I won't be back anytime soon"}
{"text":"This place has a nice, laid back atmosphere. Food is alright. I got the fried whiting with home fries and collard greens. The sides were okay (1st time I think I've tried collard greens). The fried whiting was larger than I expected but seemed a little too salty/dry."}
{"text":"We went because of the triple d episode, but I have to say it was a disappointment. The good: the fried chicken was tasty (better than the fried wings on the soul sampler), the corn bread was warm and moist and good. However, the shrimp and grits was very bland, the shrimp were not overcooked, but it truly was nothing more than brown gravy on shrimp and grits, no spice or seasoning other than salt and the focaccia bread was not toasted or even warm, like a slice of white bread with some seasoning, also disappointing. The collard greens where smothered in what had to be a bouillon base or something, completely inedible and extremely disappointing for a southern girl who loves collard greens cooked with a ham hock or some salt pork-you know, the southern way! The soul roll was just weird, everything but the kitchen sink wrapped in egg roll wrapper and deep fried. The salmon cake was more salmon than cake, nice, but also lacked in seasoning- saved by the remoulade that came with it! Perhaps my problem is my southern roots are Georgia by way of Texas and Louisiana, so a little heat and deep flavor temper my taste. This place was southern food with zero flavor or heat."}
{"text":"We had an excellent time at Mert's. Waiter was excellent for a large group. Food was homemade and unbelievable. Cost was reasonable. Highly enjoyed ourselves. We will be coming back."}
{"text":"Cool restaurant - I went here on a Monday afternoon with the wife, dad, and grandpa, while paying a little visit to Charlotte.  My dad and grandpa live in Charlotte and told us we had to try Mert's.  Cornbread was excellent - we all got our own little loaf as a starter.  Entrees come with two sides and I got the pulled pork as the main dish and okra and green beans.  The pulled pork was a little stringy and very vinegary, but unique.    Wife got the salmon cakes and I didn't really care for them.  I told her she shouldn't have ordered that, but oh well.  Her mac and cheese was great though.  My grandpa ordered the fried chicken and it looked great and he really enjoyed it.  I tried a few bites and it was very moist and crispy.  I don't remember what my dad ordered...  I like how they have tons of cool side dishes here and they're all soul food-type items.  We have tons of good restaurants in Southern California, but nothing like Mert's.  If I came back, I'd probably order the fried chicken, or the catfish if I'm feeling exotic.  They probably have about 20 or so sides - a good mixture of carbs and veggies - I wish I tried the fried green tomatoes...  Well I'll be back someday to try something different.  I'm glad my dad and grandpa took us here!"}
{"text":"I was a fan.  If you work downtown, absolutely go.  Just be prepared for at least 3 hours of the 'itis' afterward."}
{"text":"I have had the pleasure of dining at Merts frequently over the past 15+ years. I've always been pleased with the food and service. Today....I had lunch here and ordered the Merts world famous Salmon Cakes. Sadly it appears the Salmon cakes are now Salmon BALLS. The portions appears to be cut in half. To whom it may concern.....we LOVE and adore this dish, however we are disappointed someone has decided to cheat us out of this delicious menu item. I hope my next visit will reveal that someone at Merts has had a change of Heart and their Soul has led them to serve the regular portion we have grown accustom to.....otherwise it may be my last visit. I will post a photo of what I received today."}
{"text":"Stopped in here while traveling for work.  Always try to take in a triple D spot when I can!  Simply fantastic meal at a very reasonable cost.  Everything very well cooked and prepared.  Collards, beans, catfish (probably the best I've had) and chicken were all great.  Served with some sweet tea and a side of cornbread (also served with some fantastic sweet cream butter!).  Deserts looked great but honestly could not find the room.  Will need to try harder next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Really, its as good as it gets. The food is hot and fresh. The cornbread is awesome and the service is good...I love this place."}
{"text":"Want to have some traditional southern comfort food in Charlotte? This is the spot. I don't love southern comfort food so it isn't for me. I like something that wasn't cooked in bacon grease on the menu. But I know my fiancé swears by their fried chicken and I won't lie: the mac and cheese is good. If you want something light, avoid it."}
{"text":"I went to Charlotte, NC last summer to watch Bayern Munich in the International Champions Cup. We tried to go to Cowbell Burger & Whiskey Bar, but it was too long of a wait. So we decided to walk around and stumbled upon Mert's. I'm glad we did because it was great.   We had to wait a few minutes to be seated but it wasn't a long wait. The restaurant itself if really cool. Famous African Americans cover the walls of the restaurant, including Diana Ross, MLK, and Ray Charles. The multi-colored tile flooring is quite interesting. There are other unique and quirky knick knacks and objects throughout the restaurant. There is definitely a Soul vibe to Mert's. As if that wasn't enough, they play Motown (THE BEST).   I ordered the Fried Chicken Tenders with a side of mac-n-cheese, broccoli, and cornbread. The breading is what really made the chicken tenders good. If you want good soul food, this is a good place to go. The cornbread was really good and the sides were average. The prices were very reasonable. I'd recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a late dinner after the Hornets game on Halloween night. The menu had all the basics fried meats, greens, beans and mac and cheese plus loads of other sides. The food was well prepared the staff was really nice and sitting out on the street Halloween night watching nut cases in costumes go by while having a late dinner was priceless. That was the good now here's the not so good. Our waitress was really nice but was not around that much to refill drinks or replace the fork I dropped on the ground and the food was just ok. Please don't get me wrong I will be back a second time but the food was not awe inspiring or anything along those lines it was just good. I do recommend that you give Mert's a shot."}
{"text":"So it took three trips but I think I'm finally starting to become a fan of Merts.  My first visit was to pick up some catering for an event and I didn't get a chance to try anything. The second visit was a bust I ordered the chicken wings, cabbage and seasoned rice. Meh, I've had better everything. The chicken wings were just okay, and the cabbage and rice didn't have enough seasoning for my tastes.   But this last visit was much better.    We started with the Soul Rolls which come stuffed with chicken, rice, greens and black eye peas. They come topped with a spicy honey mustard sauce and were very good. They were crispy and packed with the filling. I'd recommend them. They also bring out some cornbread and that was definitely a highlight for me! It was warm and with some butter....it practically melts in your mouth.   For my meal I had the pork chops, macaroni and cheese and mashed potatoes. I was impressed with the amount of food you get! Two juicy and well seasoned (yay!) pork chops blackened with delicious seasoning. Very good. For me, the sides were just okay again. I'm not sure what to get that will give me that \"amazing\" feel but I guess I'll keep trying....  I couldn't leave without trying some dessert so I ordered the strawberry cake. It was very very moist and delicious.   So overall a much better visit this go round...I'll make my way back and give this place another try to see if they can officially win me over."}
{"text":"Best cornbread I have ever had.  A little out of the way for someone that doesn't live or work in uptown, but trust me, it's worth the trip for the cornbread alone.   I got the creole which was pretty good and authentic. Big portions that I barely even made a dent into. Honestly though, I couldn't stop thinking about the cornbread throughout the meal.  The interior is somewhat basic. It's a casual mom and pop atmosphere and you almost forget that your just steps outside of a bustling downtown area.  After a great first experience with the creole, I'm excited to return and try the fried chicken \"meat and three,\" which is what they seem to really be famous for.  Did I mention I loved the cornbread?"}
{"text":"I'll admit that I was a little disappointed to find that Mert's is a \"semi-touristy diner\" in Uptown.  (The downside being that panhandlers interrupt your meal, if you eat outside.)  I was expecting a down and dirty hole-in-the-wall place, but the food more than made up for the location and decor.  The cornbread was hot and delicious with sweet butter.  The salmon cakes were actually all salmon - no filler fish - and seared rather than breaded and fried.  The red remoulade sauce paired perfectly with the salmon cakes.  The delicious mac & cheese was baked and thick rather than just spooned from a pot.  The sweetness of the candied yams were just right to balance out the savory salmon and mac & cheese.  The waitress was amazingly friendly - reminded me of a happy drunk.  I asked her what's good, and she went through just about everything - I could tell that she eats the food rather than reciting what customers usually get.  The funniest part was her saying, \"My three favorite sides are...\" and then listing five and having to whittle down to three - mac & cheese, collard greens, and yams.  Big tip for her!  The local beer on tap is Carolina Blond, and the local wine is Biltmore.  (I thought the Merlot was just ok.)  Prices are a bit higher ($10-20), as expected for Uptown, but I think the salmon cakes with choice of two sides and cornbread are the best deal at $10."}
{"text":"The cornbread is four stars, no doubt about it.  The rest of the menu choices were pretty blah, I thought.  We were caught in that 'tween stage of eating (11:00 am... time for breakfast or lunch).  So, I had 11:00 am fried chicken, which was nothing great.  The salmon cakes were not available, and the service was sooo slow (even by laid back southern standards)."}
{"text":"This place has some good and some bad, so let's start with the good: Lunch and Dinner.  The fried chicken is excellent and I don't think I would ever order anything different here.  I've had the salmon cakes and the pulled pork BBQ, both were just OK.  Just get the chicken and thank me later!  The corn bread they bring you during lunch and dinner is amazing.  It's always been piping hot and serves as a nice base for your meal.  The sides are pretty good, nothing mind blowing, but I enjoy them every time (mac & cheese, mashed potatoes, collard greens, etc.).  Now for the bad: the service and breakfast fare.  I've had spotty service several times.  My mother wanted to substitute a few small things on the menu and her requests were all denied the last time we were there.  Very unaccommodating.  A small upcharge was not even suggested.  I reeeeally can't sub the biscuit for cornbread?  Come on.  I also saw her split a half bottle of Andre (Yes, the $5 bottle at the grocery store) into 6 mimosas.  I didn't taste a lick of champagne.  At $6.50 each I expect better.  The breakfast food wasn't anything to write home about either.  I got the Creole omelette and it had no flavor at all on top of having teeny, tiny shrimp.  The breakfast potatoes were the best part.  Sad.  Just avoid the breakfast food and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"Went to Mert's for the first time yesterday. I must say, I wasn't very impressed. My husband ordered a chicken breast quarter with green beans and mac and cheese. He had to return his chicken and ask for another breast because it was pink on the inside. Also, I tasted his mac and cheese and it was very bland. Hubby also stated the beans were bland as well.  I ordered the soul rolls and fried green tomatoes. Both were good. No complaints there. Cornbread was good.  Overall, if I have the occasion to eat here again, I will stick with the appetizers."}
{"text":"My husband and I were visiting for a wedding and were in town for 4 nights. We liked it so much, we ate here twice! The brunch was the best thing for us since I am a breakfast eater and he, not so much. I was able to get french toast, eggs and grits while the hub got meats and comfort food like mac&cheese. The corn bread they bring out is huge and amazingly tasty! I was a big fan of the grits. They had the perfect flavor and consistency. If we weren't so stuffed, we would have tried what looked like some amazing desserts, too! Thanks for helping us avoid a \"where do we eat\" argument!"}
{"text":"I went here last night with my parents for dinner. I had heard great things about Mert's and boy were they right! The fried green tomatoes were really good and the remoulade was to die for! The catfish was perfectly battered and the mac and cheese reminded me of my Grandmas... so good. The green beans were cooked just how I like them. Also to die for that we got to try, the shrimp n grits, beef short ribs, and the pound cake. Corn bread was great and the blue cheese dressing was SO good and obviously homemade. The lemonade being homemade was a treat. The service was better than I could have EVER expected, better than most restaurants. Great environment and decor. I will probably start going here regularly, as I work only a few blocks away!"}
{"text":"My husband and I walked by here before going to the museum and it smelled REALLY good, so we decided to visit for dinner. The lady at the door didn't greet us, she just stared into our souls and then told us and the couple behind to follow her. The restaurant was very small, cluttered and hot. Our waitress was nice, but I feel like she was putting on a fake voice and smile. My husband ordered the fried wings meal with macaroni and collard greens meanwhile I chose the catfish dinner with macaroni and collards. While waiting on our food, I noticed one of the waitress' picked up items for a salad with her bare hands, placed it on a plate, and took it to the customer seated on the patio. I was disgusted. Finally our food came after about 20 minutes of waiting! Yes! Our meats & macaroni were delicious, but the collard greens were terrible! Clearly, they didn't take the time cut up the greens before cooking them, so we had big leaves on our plate. After we finished our food we realized that our waitress had disappeared, which was no big deal. Moments later we heard different waitresses fussing amongst one another about her absence, and the amount of people coming in to be seated. The older lady with the long fake eyelashes kept shaking her head saying \"we can't seat them!\" Overall, the restaurant was ok, and I will not be returning. Please don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Piranhas couldn't have cleaned my plate faster.  I haven't laid into a piece of chicken like that in decades.  They make chicken like my momma did with the skin so crispy and the meat too hot too handle.  Mine was still steaming while I was dismantling it like a lion on a zebra in the Serengeti.  The bbq rib combo is juicy and would leave me wanting more if I hadn't just murdered half a plate of green beans, red rice and corn bread.  I was sopping it up with abandon.    Heart and soul is right.  There's nothing but love on the plates at Mert's.  I can't think of anywhere else in recent history where utensils like a knife and fork suddenly became an impediment to enjoying such amazingly good food.  Put your napkin in your lap, throw your table manners to the wind and enjoy.  This is down-home cooking in a casual atmosphere and reasonably priced.  It can be very busy and I recommend trying it out your first time when it's not dinner rush or on a weekend.  But even if you do it's well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews and my love of Soul food, I thought I would give Merts a try. While I loved the ambience and atmosphere of the restaurant, I have to say I was disappointed with the food. I had the beef ribs, collards, and mashed potatoes. The ribs were fatty and tough, the mashed potatoes were average and my collards were served cold. No Bueno. My boyfriend had the salmon patties which he said were just ok. The only thing worthwhile was the cornbread that came with the meal. Must say its some of the best I had. Overall I was underwhelmed and disappointed. I hate to say that I feel that Merts is more hype than anything."}
{"text":"I'm from NY. I only know what Southern cuisine entails from the Food Network Channel. Other than that, I have no concept of what things should taste like. Knowing I'd be in Charlotte for a short trip, I scouted out the food options in Downtown area and Mert's seemed to be the place where I could get my fix.  Knowing I had important business the next day, I couldn't take any chances with my stomach. My safety order of Buttermilk Fried Chicken Fingers ended up way too salty after a while. The sides of roasted potatoes and mac & cheese were just okay, nothing too mind blowing.  I wouldn't disregard this place completely after 1 visit since my party thought their orders were decent. Decent enough to put them into a food coma at 1:00 PM. Perhaps it was a bad day/I should've ordered something else.  Dat cornbread doe. Spot on."}
{"text":"Great food, great experience - as an out of town traveler who doesn't like to eat fast food every single day, finding Mert's was a pleasure.  Keeping prices down and providing a great experience is hard at any restaurant but Mert's doesn't skimp when it comes to down home food.  The tables are basic and the look and feel are simple, but this shouldn't stop you from enjoying yourself thoroughly - beginning with their tasty fresh cornbread and continuing into barbeque whether it's ribs or pulled pork.  Although this place is in North Carolina, I was happily surprised by a sauce that didn't overpower with vinegar.  On the whole, I was very happy with Mert's and will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"No idea what the service complaints are about. I was seated during a very busy Sunday brunch/midday time. I never felt ignored although the service staff was working extremely hard to keep up. I worry that some of these reviewers want to be treated like they're the only people in the restaurant (or the only ones that matter). I went in with an open heart and mind and was not disappointed at all.  The cornbread that everyone raves about? Totally deserving. The best I've had at any restaurant, ever. The fried chicken was crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside -- again, tops. The green beans I had were not the best ever, but they were very good. The mac and cheese was extremely tasty, and I think I'd have a tough time getting my kids to leave the restaurant once they tried it!  My server was gracious and sassy, just as I like 'em. When I ordered a dessert ('nana puddin') after the meal, she told me it was really good and I'd better save her a little taste. But I couldn't do it. The food was so good, I wished I had two mouths and two stomachs. She pretended to be mad at me for eating all the pudding, but I think she was happier with the generous tip.  I will come back to this place any time I'm in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"In my humble opinion, Merts has the best fried chicken around. I love it so much that I order it every time there! Their mashed potatoes are the kind that are very chunky,...love! You know that it's homemade when you get that. Their Collards are plentiful with a spicy, tangy flavor. The Peach Cobbler was an exceptional dish all on it's own.  It wasn't just regular peach cobbler, there were hints of orange zest and ginger.    Next time, I vow to try something different and hope to resist the urge to order the fried chicken again!"}
{"text":"First truly \"authentic\" Soul Food stop in a long, long time.  We had Fried Whiting, Salmon, Shrimp plus cornbread, green beans, and also mac and cheese with a plate of fried green tomatoes to start...and it was \"smack yo mama\" good!  Service was downright AWESOME.  My only disappointment was the beer selection, which on one hand is a longer list than most establishments, is sadly nevertheless woefully void of any redeeming qualities, save for the Carolina Blond by Foothills (and even that is a stretch).  Be sure to park in the Holiday Inn garage, they validate!"}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp!  We were in town visiting and decided to try this place for lunch based on its good reviews.  Yelpers were right on - delicious (and affordable)!  We loved the cornbread, candied yams, collard greens, carolina chopped bbq, mac & cheese, green beans, and black eyed peas.  Generous portions too.  Full of atmosphere and it was still busy at 3pm.    We definitely recommend Mert's."}
{"text":"Love Merts. Hate trying to find parking. Cornbread is good, salmon is good, pork chops are amazing. Chicken is ok. Bit of a soul-food-meets-Cajun restaurant, good local flavor. Love supporting somewhere that's not a chain."}
{"text":"I was in Charlotte for the first time and decided to treat myself to a good southern dinner. My waitress Teresa greeted me with Southern Hospitality and just when thought that I had my meal selected (after reading Yelp, of course) she told me of the dinner specials, one of which was grilled catfish with mango chutney + two sides of your choice for $14.95! Sold. I choose yams and mac&cheese with a Carolina Blonde ($4.00) to wash it down. Oh yeah, and complimentary corn bread with honey butter to start. A delicious dinner well worth the value!"}
{"text":"I have been to Mert's many times over the years and the food is always spectacular, and the service is great!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that my experience was horrible and I would not recommend this place to anyone.  My wife and I came to Charlotte celebrating our anniversary and decided to try Mert's per recommendation of her supervisor and because of the high praise the restaurant received online.  We were seated in a reasonable time but it was all down hill from there. We were seated at 7:15pm and were given some bland cornbread.  At 8:15pm we were still waiting for our order to be prepared (cooked)...not brought to us...PREPARED! Now mind you no one even a word of apology or an update on the status of our food during the wait. Finally I had enough and walked out. Our waitress and management still did not offer an apology despite seeing us leave the restaurant visibly upset. We left and walked to E2 (emeralds restaurant) and received the best meal and customer service I've ever experienced. I'd recommend all the other restaurants in downtown Charlotte before Mert's. :-/"}
{"text":"Highly overrated and seeing that I was visiting  I wish we had went else where . Their sides are terrible ! Mostly over cooked and or not seasoned properly ! I could've made better at home which is always disappointing when you go out to eat . However their chicken and fish were good and their servers were also polite and helpful which is the only reason I am giving them two stars ."}
{"text":"I rarely give bad reviews, but this was a pretty horrible food experience. My cousin was in town today from Seattle and requested \"good soul food.\" I've heard good things about Mert's, but have not had an opportunity to try. I figured it would be a good opportunity to show my cousin some good souther food. HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. The fried chicken was pretty bland. It seemed like it was pre-made and left out for too long. The collard greens were insanely salty. Instant high blood pressure for sale! :( I ordered the salmon cakes which were really hard. I have to say that the corn bread was absolutely amazing, which makes no sense that the rest of the food was so unappetizing."}
{"text":"On June 25, 2015 at approximately 1230 pm I was at Mertz Soul Food Restaurant. I ordered 3 piece chicken wing dinner. The order was to go. When I got home I noticed that the chicken had not been cleaned, there were little pieces of feathers on the edge on the wings. I pulled what I thought to be feather, and it was a long blonde hair that cooked into the skin of chicken. Just the sight of me pulling the blonde hair from the chicken cause me to almost vomit."}
{"text":"What I Ate:  Fried Chicken, BBQ Beef Rib, Sweet Potatoes, Greens, Corn Bread, Homemade Lemonade  Awesome Southern food for downtown.  The food was incredibly tasty and the interior is a old style diner.  The servers were helpful in picking the right foods."}
{"text":"Food is good and workers are nice and friendly.  I was there alone for business and told them I was from out of town.  They came to check on me a few times to make sure I was satisfied with the food.  I had the pulled pork plate with mac and cheese, hush puppies, and pickled onions.  For dessert, I had the banana pudding which was excellent!  Entire meal cost about $16."}
{"text":"This is exactly the kind of restaurant I wanted to eat at on my southern state adventure! The decor made me feel at home, the waitress was friendly and had the perfect southern drawl, the food smelled wonderful, and the sweet tea...oh the sweet tea was good! Plus it's located in Uptown Charlotte which made it all the better.   It was lunch time when we went. I ordered the pulled pork as my main dish with yams and collard greens as my sides. The cornbread was really delicious and i really liked the butter which had a sweet taste to it. The food took a little while to come out but I wasn't really in a hurry to leave. I was excited when it did come out though. The pork had the most wonderful flavor ever. It was drenched in the yummy sauce that they use which was sweet yet spicy. Perfect. The yams were just right and the collard greens were delicious. A California native, I have never had collard greens before but I know for damn sure these were good!   The freshly made cakes looked awesome but I was just too full to order a piece.   The price was right and the food was great. I think I might need to plan another trip to Charlotte soon so I can eat at Merts again!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is amazing. Seriously...loved the decorations and the open kitchen.  The service was great.   The food was...mmmm ok....my mom's soul food is better, but we couldn't quite pin down what the strange seasoning (not strange, bad...just strange, new) was in most every veggie dish. Maybe just a difference between Texas and Carolina cooking.   The jumbo chicken wings were delicious. The fried green tomatoes made me want to watch Fried Green Tomatoes.   Worth the price? Not sure...I've just had better soul food."}
{"text":"Hot locals spot. A friend that lives in town took me to me here. Gets pretty full around lunch time. Would definitely recommend for true southern taste. Try the black eyed peas and corn bread!"}
{"text":"There's a neon sign labeled \"Eat\" outside. I don't need anymore directions than that at Mert's, which might be my favorite place in the Uptown Charlotte area.  This is where I take my out-of-town friends, especially ones who have never experienced what a brick of cornbread looks like, especially one that comes with housemade honey butter. The tea ninjas (or wait-staff) make sure our cups never runneth empty and might tell us some jokes here and there. We'd always eat our vegetables if they were like the ones here: macaroni and cheese (I know, not a vegetable), collard greens (got a little pico de gallo), and the okra stew are some of the best. The Daily Fixin's have some classic choices like fried chicken and catfish, but I really love the salmon cakes, which come with sauce that'd be great on burgers. You'll be fuller than a piggy bank on pay day, but some banana puddin'(g) is a spectacular dessert.  I love the album cover decorations and the music that comes from them-all Motown and Stax classics. Soul music is where a lot of the \"Soul\" comes from; the rest is from the quirky decor and the buzzing of conversation from families out to dinner or couples before/after a play. The whole place has old theatre posters and sepia photographs, not because it's \"cool,\" but because Mert's is a beloved part of Charlotte. The bankers across the street even banded together to keep it afloat during a rough financial period. Say what you will about their handling of the economic crisis, but fiscal cliffs have got nothing on Mert's.  It owns my heart, soul, and if I ever have children, maybe even my first-born."}
{"text":"This is one of those places you can go at lunch time and run into everyone from your local car detailer to power-brokers like the former CEO of NationsBank (now Bank of America).  The food is absolutely delish, but be warned - your clothes and hair will smell of southern-fried goodness when you leave. If you are craving good ole soul food - aka southern \"comfort foods\" this place is a must-try!"}
{"text":"The food was great. I had the catfish & chicken qtr. combo with greens & yams. You could tell the sides were made ahead of time (they were barely room temperature) but were still pretty tasty. I'd recommend checking this place out if you find yourself in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Heard from friends it was just ok, but was hungerin for soul food and wanted to decide for myself.   Ordered quarter leg chicken with catfish, sides of collard greens and mac & cheese. Chicken was cooked through but the meat made me think they'd gotten it from a mass market supplier, yet and still no compliants on the taste. Mac & cheese was AweSoMe. Didn't have that stretch-cheese consistensy, more crumblike, no complaints here either. Greens can be made a few different ways, this way wasn't my fave but they weren't nasty, a lil on the tart side but the red onions helped to cut through the taste.  After an absence from seafood for years, I wanted to get back in the ring and decided to try catfish for the first time. This was really good. It was breaded well, seasoned too, and not greasy (neither was the chicken). I like the sauce they give even though it probably just mayo & some other type of dressing mixed together.   Guy who took my order said the cornbread was on the small side so he gave me two. No recession in this order woohoo! Butter was nice and creamy, cornbread was one of the best I've ever had.  When traveling to, look for the big \"EAT\" sign seen in the pics. The Mert's sign isn't as easy to pinpoint especially while driving. And when you walk in, if it's anything like my visit, expect to see smiles and people ready to serve you."}
{"text":"Really good fried chicken. The collard greens are made with barbecue sauce and the stems so I'll pass on them. Real collards are just the leaves, no stems and no barbecue sauce EVER. The mac and cheese is ok. Black eyed peas need salt but are good. Mashed potatoes with gravy is good. The coconut cake was really moist but the frosting tasted like it came from a can overly sweet. Coconut cake frosting is made from egg whites and melted granulated sugar beat together into frosting.  Our waitress was great but their professionalism could use an upgrade."}
{"text":"The food was excellent!  OMG, the cornbread!  And the mac n cheese!  Better than my mamas!  And the candied yams were to die for.  Honestly, the service was only so-so.  The waitress rarely came back to the table.  I ordered a side of collard greens with no tomatos and onions on top.  The waitress forgot the collards, and when I reminded her, she brought it out cold and with the toppings.  Soo if you just want the great food, and are not too concerned about the service, then give it a try.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I love soul food restaurants and this one is definitely a fave. I haven't tried anything there that I have not loved. I hate cornbread in general, but Mert's cornbread is something that every Charlottean should experience. Love it."}
{"text":"It's hard to find good soul food places this place hit the spot. I got the fried whiting with Mac and cheese and yams. The fish was fried pretty good. Mac and cheese was some of the best I've had. Overall a really good place to eat."}
{"text":"GOOD food! I recommend the salmon cakes, greens, mac n cheese. Their cornbread is amazing, as well! The ambiance is something out of an old soul's home...amazing pictures of celebrities who've been in town & the soul music overhead is so good! The staff is friendly & attentive. Keep in mind, they stay pretty busy for lunches & dinners. What's REALLY good is their New Year's brunch, every Jan. 1st. $20 for all you can eat buffet!"}
{"text":"For me, Mert's is just \"OK\". Maybe I am biased, but I feel this is the kind of food you must be in the mood for. Southern soul/comfort food just isn't something that can be eaten 24/7.   I had a sampler platter for entree which includes beef ribs, chicken tenders, and Mert's spring rolls. The beef ribs are actually very good! The beef is quite tender and easily come off the bones, and the fact that it's beef rather than your typical port ribs made a huge difference.   The spring rolls and chicken tenders are just a little too salty, fatty and heavy-tasting for me, but I guess that's the essence of the southern soul food.  Oh, last note, their corn bread is really good, you can tell it's very fresh and home-made."}
{"text":"Mert's is one of those go-to, Charlotte staple, consistently filling, always busy, and good-luck-finding-a-seat kind of spots you can't miss if you're a regular diner around town. Even if you're in town for an extended stay, Mert's should fall on your radar within in the first few days.   Where I'm not a huge soul/comfort food goer on the regular, the fried chicken, fried catfish, mac n' cheese and other sides have all sang beautifully upon my many visits. One thing that sticks out more frequently and consistently beckons my palate is the lemonade. Goodness gracious, it's that good. Sometimes, I think of stopping in just for a big glass to go.   One thing to keep in mind about Mert's is that it functions quite differently than other Uptown culinary hearths. This place is busy throughout the week and the weekends. Not uncommon for them to be on a wait well into a Sunday afternoon. Plan accordingly, should you find yourself visiting during any \"peak\" hour.   Service is ever-so friendly and I love the \"shoe art(?)\" in the men's bathroom. Kind of odd, but definitely worth a gander if you've never seen it.   Mert's, thank you. Just...for everything."}
{"text":"I need not say no more  Great food  Great service  Great Atmosphere Great Location  The server was exceptionally gorgeous and kind.  Took care of my table with class and care"}
{"text":"You get a lot of food - for a very good price.  Meal starts of with giant steaming mini cornbreads.  Order an entree and get choice of two sides (mac and cheese, potatoes, fries etc).    Fried chicken was great.  Sides were somewhat disappointing.  Cornbread was amazing!"}
{"text":"Hands-down the BEST meal I had while in Charlotte. The atmosphere is laid back (no need to get dressed up) and the servers know everything about the food & the menu so if you have a question, ASK! They'll make sure you're happy with your order. I got the shrimp & grits with their homemade corn bread. I couldn't have been happier. The prices are very reasonable for how much food you get and you'll be looking forward to your next meal at Mert's Soul Food. I know I am!"}
{"text":"Where do I begin?! We came because of a Groupon. The fried chicken was probably some of the best we have ever had. I loved the crunchy, buttery cornbread. Wish we would have saved room for desserts bc they looked pretty dang good.  The location is great, right in Uptown with nice outdoor seating.  Service was great as well. Our server was sweet and attentive and was especially nice regarding the Groupon. Prices were also reasonable, with large portions.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The food here is unbelievably amazing. I had the fried chicken with mac and cheese (to die for) and yams (delicious). I got red velvet cake to go. Cornbread is super good. This is the real deal."}
{"text":"Don't be turned off by first impressions. Eclectic atmosphere and great food. Be prepared to eat because the portions are generous. I had the salmon patties which came with corn bread and two sides. More food than I should have eaten but it was to good to stop!"}
{"text":"Gritty greens,everytime!...Need I say more?? Not what they use to be."}
{"text":"I love Mert's.  They have the BEST cornbread I've ever had, ever.   The fried chicken is crispy and juicy.  The mac and cheese is perfect, the mashed potatoes are creamy.  The service is great.  But it's cursed.  Both times I've taken a boyfriend there, he's broken up with me within 2 weeks.  WHY?!  I'm afraid to go back there now, unless it's with friends.    Also, the first time I went the server accidentally broke the heat lamp right above the food...she stared at it as if she didn't know just what to do, and just picked a few pieces of glass out of the greens...which ended up being MY greens, so I didn't eat them.   But my mouth is watering at this very moment thinking about that cornbread."}
{"text":"Food is good.  I recommend they stop using curry in the chop beef."}
{"text":"All I can say is YUM!  You really can't go wrong here.  The atmosphere fits the cuisine and I loved all of it.  (Okay except for the sauteed squash but this is no biggie).  The fried chicken, beef ribs (which I don't ever eat), sweet tea, cornbread, potatoes, and on and on are fabulous.  So tasty!  Of course there is no calorie-counting here but it's a great experience that makes you feel good."}
{"text":"We had to come try this place out since it had amazing reviews. We were disappointed TWICE!..The service was great both times.  We had carryout the first time and ate in the second.  The place was busy both times and the Chicken wings were the only thing that was consistently good.  The Collard Greens are the toughest and tasteless greens I've ever had and the Mac & Cheese is so so.  My Husband had the fried whiting and it was tasty but he also didn't like the sides and said the greens were gritty. We both agree that the cornbread is delicious.  I would return for the Chicken Wings only."}
{"text":"The best thing to get at mert's are the jumbo wings. Not the best soulfood I've had, & it would be nice if the drinks were home made."}
{"text":"\"My GOD \" were the initial reactions  that my husband and I had upon our first taste of the ribs! They were delicious!  The restaurant  is a quaint little spot in the middle of Uptown Charlotte.  If you like soul food and want to enjoy a quick walk through time, please visit Mert's Heart and Soul!"}
{"text":"Amazing soul food. Ate here almost daily when living uptown, the always friendly staff makes it feel more like family, adding to the comfort food appeal.  Owner in resturaunt (at least when I used to go) multiple times a day."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a friend yesterday and I've been freaking out about this restaurant since - to anyone who will listen. The staff & service: top notch. Such lovely waitstaff, so friendly and attentive.  The cornbread. I mean, so good.  For my main dish, I had the 4 veggie plate & chose Mashed Potatoes, Mac & Cheese, Okra & Tomatoes and Black-eyed Peas. The mac & cheese was life-changing.   I thoroughly enjoyed the entire experience, and can't wait to bring my husband!"}
{"text":"Oooh I loves me some Mert's! When I worked downtown this place was a regular on my list of favorite lunch spots. You can smell it a block away! Amidst all the new fine dining places Charlotte has to offer is this little gem of home cooked greasy goodness.  It's hard to recommend any one thing in particular, because I've had almost the entire menu...but I guess my favorite meal had to be the blackened pork chops with some yams, charleston red rice and sauteed squash on the side. It's the kind of lick your lips food that makes you forget it's going to be a long day on the treadmill tomorrow. The fried chicken is also fantastic, as is the shrimp po'boy.  The owners here are so friendly, and you often see various members of the family working the registers or serving tables. They talk to all the patrons like they're newly inducted members of the family, and make it a very fun, comfortable atmosphere to eat some great food in. We've also used them for catering several times and they stole the from some of Charlotte's biggest names."}
{"text":"Perfect atmosphere. Fried chicken, fried catfish, collard greens, macaroni and cheese, and yam. All like Mama used to make if she only knew how."}
{"text":"This was our first time visiting Mert's and we were pleased! The food is AMAZING! The crab cakes are to die for :-). The banana pudding was yummy! We will definitely be back for some soul food!"}
{"text":"Recommended by a local, we stopped here to eat while on vacation - around 5-6pm on a weeknight. We had prompt and courteous service and THE BEST cornbread we'd ever eaten! It was moist and light, not the dense, dry, crumbly stuff I usually associate with cornbread. The waitress shared that you could find the recipe online - and I did reasonably well recreating it at home. The collards, yams and other sides were fantastic. The BBQ was too strong (vinegary) for me, but overall it was a great meal and good value for money."}
{"text":"I finally made it to Mert's for dinner. I got the beef ribs. They were pretty good. The Mac and Cheese was delicious and a little burned on the bottom, just the way I like it. My dad got the chopped pork barbeque and loved it. I could eat that cornbread all night. Every time we've ever been here, the service has been extremely friendly which pushes them from 4 stars to 5 stars. I will definitely be back and next time I'll have to save room for desert."}
{"text":"the best soul food place i've been to.  Corn bread has the texture of pound cake, but still has the corn flavor. Fried chicken is perfect, collard greens nice and vinegary.  German chocolate cake is moist and delicious!  I went two nights in a row for dinner!  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet.  I used to live uptown and would come here for lunch often.  I'm not a cornbread fan but I do love their cornbread.  I also finally had their chicken tenders over the weekend and they were excellent.  I debated between the salmon cakes or the chicken tenders and decided to try something different and I'm glad I did. I had the mac and cheese and collard greens as my accompaniments and I was pretty full, but couldn't take a doggie bag since I was headed to SMG for a movie :(  This is the place I try to take out-of-towners and point tourists towards since to me this is Charlotte cooking and it has a great location uptown on College."}
{"text":"Lunch comes with corn bread. I really enjoyed the bbq pork ribs, I highly recommend them! The ribs seemed to have been marinated in sauce over night then they add a vinaigrette type sauce over them which really packs on the flavor. If you have room for desert def get the banana cake, I am a banana pudding fanatic so the cake was right up my alley! The cake was very moist and smooth only 1 word could describe it- delicious!  My only issue with this place is the fruit flies, sorry the little flies are a big problem. They need to fix that! If it wasn't for that I would've given 5/5 stars"}
{"text":"Best soul food I've had while in the south. The service was fast and friendly. The BBQ ribs fell off the bone and were succulent. The greens had a combined tangy and sweet flavor. The mac and cheese was creamy. The catfish...perfectly fried. Drum roll please...the peach cobbler was just like grandma's, to die for! Reasonable prices for good home cooking."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and it's the best southern cooking I've ever had, including in Savannah.  This place is the real deal.  Every entree in our party of 20+ looked and tasted amazing.  The cornbread is super good and a slice of cake for desert is a must.  Just pick your favorite, if you can pick just one.  YUM!!!"}
{"text":"My only complaint was that the biscuits were a bit hard, in any case I had brunch which was the Carolina BBQ with Grits and salmon cakes. I was not impressed with the home fries; which seemed not to fresh. The staff and servers were really welcoming and it was good service."}
{"text":"Great food. Cheap prices for big portions. Get the grits...creamy and delicious. Salmon cakes, shrimp poboy, collard greens...we tried it all, and it was good."}
{"text":"Not a lot to say other than great southern comfort food. Good fried chicken, great beef ribs. Small servings of ribs, but great flavor. Loved the collard greens and coconut cake. I'd go back. Definately worth trying."}
{"text":"I'm particular about my soul food. Seeing how I can cook it myself, paying for someone else to make it means the food better be pretty damn good.  Merk's is the bomb, and it's cheap. I don't know how they get away with serving so much food for such a low price, but bless them.   A 3 veggie plate is less than $7. You can't beat that.   The yams are sweet and sticky. The collards have a smoky taste without the unnecessary addition of meat. The cornbread with the honey butter was perfect. And, the mac n cheese is cheesy without a lot of grease.  The only complaint I had was the service. For this to be Charlotte the server wasn't very Southern cordial. Also, it was quite a second we waited to be seated and to have our order taken. Minus the service this place would be 5 stars."}
{"text":"Mert's has been around for some time now and they still remain the same in that it's all in what you order which will determine whether you're going to like them or not.  Some things are really good like the cornbread, soul rolls, and salmon cakes but some things are just ok like the mac n cheese, greens, and chicken.  The service is always pleasant and their dedicated patrons will keep them among the soul food favorites in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday for dinner. Had the pork chops, red beans, mac n cheese, and corn bread.   Corn bread was soft and delicious.  Pork chop was thin and had enough seasoning on it for me.   Overall I was pretty happy with my selection. The waitress was friendly and I'd go here again."}
{"text":"Very very good soul food. We were raised in Charleston and this place has all of the soul of the holy city in one location in the middle of Charlotte."}
{"text":"Closet thing to southern comfort I've found in Charlotte. I had the chicken breast which was JUICY with a side of Mac & Cheese and Collard greens. The sweet tea was too perfection! I craved the pound cake / red velvet for dessert but they were out. Hopefully next time around I'll get to feed my sweet tooth craving. Definitely worth the trip"}
{"text":"After participating in the Charlotte heart walk, my friends and I went to Mert's for brunch. We knew the service probably wouldn't be that great but expected the food to make up for that. Big fail on that expectation. The collard greens were dry with no flavor and when someone on my party asked if she could exchange them for something else the waitress caught an attitude. Whenever we would ask for something it was almost like a mother may I situation. We didn't know if her reaction would be positive or negative. The manager seemed to not care about our situation and just left everything up to the waitress. After paying my bill I waited for my change that never came. I ended up asking for the manager to find out where the waitress went with my money. After the manager asked the waitress the waitress states she already gave me my change  after reminding her that she didn't give me anything she states oh then I have your money right here! It was in her pocket. Not sure how she could have forgotten that she owed me more than $10!! Especially since the tip was already included in the bill! Never going back and I will never recommend this place to anyone. Even if I do have a living social coupon!!"}
{"text":"this is hands down some of the best soul food i have ever had, honestly some of the best food period....friendly staff and very good customer service, i will be eating here every time i visit charlotte"}
{"text":"Hit up merts for dinner last night..  Had the Fried catfish and Beef rib combo.  Whole fried catfish was a little tough to negociate the bones and didnt not yeald much fish. \"The beef rib\" was chopped up and in a small pile bones and all.  Like other have said the goodness in in the sides..  Mac and Cheese was real and had a nice crust on the top and the corn bread was good.. athough the piece my wife got looked like it was in the oven a littlel too long and dried out a bit.  Overall decent stop"}
{"text":"Ive never had soul food better coming to Mertz and it was so worth the money. I had the shrimp and gritz every restaurant that has them i will try so i got them and fell in love. The atmosphere is in credible. The staff was friendly and received our food fast and piping hott."}
{"text":"I am not too picky and maybe I caught Mert's on two bad occasions, but I have not received good service from them during the two attempts I made. A long wait and not being greeted at the door for about 15 minutes. They food might be good, but I would not know. I may give them one more attempt but sheeesh!"}
{"text":"Quick work visit to NC and decided to for go getting my usual fried chicken tacos and the taco place after I smelled the beautiful aromas coming from this place! The place is cute and the staff was very friendly , the waitress was very nice and personable. I ordered the meal with BBQ ribs , fried catfish , greens, candy sweets(yams), mac-n-cheese and cornbread and sweet tea( I know I was super greedy). My food came quickly and was sooooooooooooo good I swear  I bet black Jesus was back there cooking it himself!!!!!! I tasted those ribs and had to stop my self from giving into the urge to breakout in dance !! I make frequent stops in Clt and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were Uptown and chose Mert's based on the Yelp reviews and the Soul Rolls.  They both exceeded my expectations.  The atmosphere was warm and welcoming, while the food tasted fresh.  Next time I am uptown, I will stop in just for the Soul Rolls.  Highly Recommended."}
{"text":"I went to Mert's the Friday after thanksgiving, as we had a taste for soul food. This was my first time trying this place out and everything was mediocre at best. The waitress was really nice, so my review is not taking away from the service at all. The fried wings were decent, they could've been fried harder. The Mac and cheese was ok, it seemed like it wasn't the freshest. The black eyed peas were terrible! They were hard and undercooked. I am willing to give them a second chance, The next time I go, I may try something different."}
{"text":"I cant say enough good things about this place... To sum it up.. If you haven't been GO NOW!!! It is perfection in every bite! Especially the fried catfish and collards!!!!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with the beef ribs and fried chicken breast combo! It comes with delicious cornbread and two sides of your choice. A must try if you are in uptown Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Ten thumbs up!!! amazing food and great staff definitely will be back again! I would definitely refer people to come here and eat! I had the cat fish and ribs with Mac n cheese and mashed potatoes! Delish"}
{"text":"Mert's was the first restaurant I ever visited on my first ever trip to Charlotte a couple of years ago. As far as I'm concerned, it's the only one I would truly ever need! I come from a family of Southerners who are absolute connoisseurs of cornbread. My parents agree that Mert's fresh, hot cornbread slathered with a pat of butter is the best they've ever tasted. (Sorry to my great-grandpa who owned a Southern diner outside Knoxville, TN, whose cornbread recipe has been passed down the generations of my family ever since - it's a close second.) Their Soul Rolls are divine, but with the cornbread and generous portions, an appetizer isn't really needed. I have had the fried chicken (excellent), the beef short ribs (delicious), and the fried catfish (fantastic), but the meal that in my mind has been handed down straight from heaven is the salmon cakes. Mert's Famous Salmon Cakes are served with their homemade remoulade sauce and give you a glimpse into heaven that you will want to savor slowly. My go-to side items are the collard greens, topped with tomato and onion, and the mac and cheese. I went to Mert's after the most recent half-marathon I completed, devoured my delicious meal and polished it off with a giant slice of their sweet potato cake. It sounded too interesting to pass up. And, when else could I have justified all those delicious calories? I have only had one \"hit or miss\" visit to Mert's, where the cornbread was a bit toastier than I prefer, but everything was still fantastic. Most of the time, you are in for one of THE best meals you can get in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Mert's you certainly captured my heart, soul...no way...but heart, yes ma'am!   I ordered the Fried Chicken breast with Mac n Cheese & Collard Greens on the side. The chicken was tender and the fried chicken shell the perfect mix of crispy with the juicy chicken meat. The mac & cheese was so utterly delicious it nearly stole the show. It was so creamy. They have hot sauce on every table, a great sign that you're about to experience good soul food. Sure 'nuff, the meal did not disappoint. The cornbread was out of this world good. I was so full after all that food, dessert was out of the question but they had some really amazing looking cakes.   Next time I'm in Charlotte I will definitely be making a pit stop!"}
{"text":"So just like you I saw all the great ratings and this place was close to my hotel so I figured it was a no-brainer. It's ok.... but not \"averaging 4 stars ok.\"  I had the red beans, rice, and smoked sausage. There was literally no flavor in the dish at all. I had to drown it in hot sauce for it to taste like anything. The fried green tomatoes were soggy and average. The star of my meal was the cabbage surprisingly.  The service was great. Everything else, meh.  I don't think this place is bad by any means, but I won't be heading back anytime soon."}
{"text":"We came to Mert's after a couple hours of play at the Discovery Place science museum just a few blocks away.  The place was pretty much empty at 5:30, two tables inside and one outside.  I think it may have been a shift change because everything was just a little slow.  It took a few minutes to get us seated, took a few minutes to come get the drink order, then took a few minutes to bring us the drinks.... so from the time we walked in, we did not get to order until about 5:45.  I ordered the Soul Sampler - Buttermilk chicken tenders, soul roll (egg roll with black eye peas, chicken, cabbage), ribs, and corn bread.    The soul rolls were really good, but came with a honey mustard already on them, which I loved, but would not be good for everyone.  The corn bread was by far the best part, hot right out of the oven.  Happy faces all around for 7 people...4 adults, 3 kids.    I ordered the catfish and creole combo - the catfish was almost a whole fish, minus the head.....all the fins and bones were still there....  other than that, it was fried to perfection with a really nice batter.  The grease in the fryers must have been really fresh, as I could not taste it in any of my fried food, which is normally the only complaint I could have with fried food.  My creole was lovely 5 out of 5, lots of shrimp and the celery and onions were crisp.  Good flavor, good heat, my nose was sweating a little, but not unpleasant at all.  The BBQ sauce was vinegary and sweet, which was good, but the ribs and pulled pork really just tasted like the sauce.    The wait staff started to warm up to us at the end, so we finished of nice.    Would I come again, no... am I glad I went, yep!!  I love soul food, but sadly I have had better in Detroit Michigan.  I would rather go to Sloes BBQ on Michigan Ave.  The green beans were AWESOME, though as you would expect with soul food, cooked until mushy, though the flavor was just subtle and great.    We were also plagued by fruit flys....when ever there was food on the table, there were fruit flies doing fly bys.....I started to hum, \"Highway to the Danger zone\" but no one seemed to get the reference."}
{"text":"I was so excited to come here. I love southern food, so I was determined to get some during this trip to Charlotte. From the menu, I picked the fried chicken meal with collard greens and mac-n-cheese.  The fried chicken was quite good, juicy with a crispy exterior. The greens were a-ok--seems like there too much vinegar in it.  The mac-n-cheese was grainy and mealy (i.e., not smooth).  Value-wise, it's a great deal.  With that large-portion meal and a drink, it was a little over 10 bucks!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! It looks like a little dive-bar in the heart of downtown Charlotte, but once you walk in you know you're home! Everyone was super friendly and happy to explain anything on the menu or make recommendations. I had the boneless fried chicken (how do they make plain-ol' chicken taste SO incredible?!) and couldn't decided between coleslaw, mashed potatoes with gravy, or macaroni and cheese and the waitress suggested the two starches... I was sceptical but couldn't have been happier once my meal came. Oh, and be sure to start with the warm cornbread and honey butter!"}
{"text":"Sides were ok but my chicken breast was small and so dry I choked on the first bite. We had to flag down the waiter to tell him about it. He said he would get me another one. 10 minutes later He came by and said it would be ready in 5 or 6 min. 20 minutes later no chicken breast, Had to have someone go get our waiter, who said he was sorry and that it was in the fryer. I didn't have time, had a play to go too. Been looking forward to a meal there for a long time and was excited when I went in, won't go back. Floor was greasy slick too."}
{"text":"Mert's came highly recommended by several people so I made it my first stop on my visit to Charlotte. I was sadly disappointed. The best thing about my meal was the corn bread. I ordered the blackened pork chops with black eyed peas and yams. The pork chops were super thin and dry. The sides were just okay. My colleague ordered the chicken fingers with mac and cheese and collard greens. While her sides were delicious she thought the chicken fingers missed the mark."}
{"text":"I had a Denver omelet, biscuit, cornbread and grits while visiting Charlotte. This place was very tasty and reasonably priced. The ice tea was very good as well."}
{"text":"Loved the ambience and the staff.  The food was alright.  I grew up on southern cooking so I'm tough to please.  The one thing I will tell you is that their braised cabbage is THE BEST I've ever had.  Get three orders of it and make it your meal."}
{"text":"The food surpassed my expectations. My cousin visiting from Delaware wanted Southern Comfort food so I asked on FB for a recommendation and almost everyone said \"Mert's\"! We both had the fried chicken, she had mashed potatoes and collards for sides whereas I went with the mac and cheese and black-eyed peas. Then, as our plates were cleared and we paid our checks, we wanted to sit for a few more minutes before leaving. It was way before closing time so that was no reason to do what our server did, plop and wet dish towel on our table right in front of us as she passed which we assumed was a signal to leave.   How disgusting. We tried to be this \"fancy\" Uptown and then something like this is just a little embarrassing, don't you think?"}
{"text":"First time eating here and it was okay. My friends and I order the same ( salmon cakes with mac and cheese) only difference was that I got cabbage and she got collards, but both were tasty. Would have liked move flavor for the salmon. I will give this place another go with a different entree choice."}
{"text":"3.5 but you should go there so they get a 4.  Everything was delicious.  The side snapper was a whole fish!  Was so stuffed I didn't get to try the desserts but they looked awesome.  Great value."}
{"text":"While visiting Charlotte for the first time, my friend stumbled upon this via Yelp and it was an excellent choice.   I had the salmon cakes, collard greens, and yams and everything was fresh and delicious. If you happen to be in Charlotte, this place is a must. Ask for Robin the waitress. She is amazing!"}
{"text":"Definitely a must go to! I had the locals recommend this place to me. It was so good i ate two dinners her the same night. I had Sharon serve me and she really knew her stuff. She first suggested  the salmon cakes which were amazing with the side sauce. This is a MUST get if your trying something out there for the first time.  Add a sweet tea to it as well! Cannot go wrong with that!  Then she suggested the sweet potato pie, which was AMAZING!!! It was so fluffy and tasty! And it was a nice portion as well!  Then I went back later for my second dinner and I got the shrimp and grits, which was a southern classic and that was very good as well! I cannot complain, the service was amazing, they took care or me there and they really are very kind and nice to you!  They make you feel like family there and they all are very generous. Portions are great and food is AMAZING!!! Definitely eat here if your in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I love Soul/Southern Food. I loooove Macaroni and Cheese. Inexplicably, I looooove meatloaf. And I love cabbage! With all that said, while I had the lunch special of meatloaf, macaroni and cheese, and purple cabbage, I didn't love anything on my plate (ehhh, maybe the cabbage). I have to say I barely liked my meal. The meatloaf was dry, even though the chef was kind enough to squirt some ketchup on there. The macaroni and cheese I suppose was better than the Blue Box, but I've had muuuuch better. It wasn't nasty, like some places I've tried, but it definitely wasn't good. The purple cabbage was pretty tasty though.  The meal was so lackluster that I was left craving my stepmother's meatloaf and macaroni and cheese (mmmmm). Maybe I went on a bad day, but for my first experience, it was disappointing.  Also the cakes they had on display at the counter looked sooooo dry, really unappetizing."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, but I wasn't really a big fan of the décor of the restaurant. Their fried chicken was really good, the mac & cheese seemed a little bland."}
{"text":"I don't know what all the fuss is about.  The cornbread is good, but they are stingy with the butter.  (one little container for four small loaves).  The servings for the kids meals were ridiculously small, and they burnt the outside of the chicken fingers!  My kids would not even eat them.  Another big problem.....parking!  Charlotte is not getting locals into downtown on the weekends because you have to pay to park everywhere!  I called the restaurant before going and asked where to park.  The person told me we could park for free in the Holiday Inn parking garage.  Not so!  We had to pay $8 just to park for lunch!  All said, we spent $60 for soul food!  Rice and bean, shrimp creole, one kids plate of 2 chicken fingers, and one kids vegetable plate.  Also, kids meals did not include a drink, and they charge $2.00 for a child's drink.  It was hot in the restaurant, loud from the voices of other diners, and you couldn't hear the music.  This place is not worth the price.  I could have prepared that food several times over for what I paid in that restaurant!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, and the service was good... It's just that the food wasn't. Mac & cheese was watery. \"Yams\" were a sweet potato with brown sugar sprinkled on top, red beans did not include rice (never met anyone who doesn't make rice with red beans), and there was something else nasty that I forgot... They took my plate back and gave me a shrimp po' boy with 5 shrimp in it, and the bread was dry. They blamed the Gullah people for that style of cooking. I didn't say anything, but my family went to SC every year because we had a time-share in Hilton Head--- so I've tasted Gullah food before and it taste like regular southern style soul food.... This place was a huge disappointment for me."}
{"text":"Whenever I want to taste my Mom's cooking I just go to Mert's.   The fried chicken tastes just like hers & the strawberry cake that she used to make for my bday."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! The sign from the street says EAT. Not till we walked up to the door did we see the logo for Mert's so it's a bit tricky to spot while driving.   Our waitress, Latosha, was absolutely amazing. She was helpful, friendly and funny.  She had us laughing every time she came to our table.  My husband ordered the fried chicken and I had the creole salmon.  Both were really good. The home fries were a bit too greasy but the yams, Mac and cheese and collard greens were all excellent. The corn bread was served pipping hot, with butter.    I will definitely come back again when I visit Charlotte."}
{"text":"I came to Mert's based on a recommendation of a bus driver.  I figure who knows soul food better than a fat guys who's been a lot of places.  Am I right?    I was pleasantly greeted at the door and brought to the table by my server who promptly brought me a Yuengling nano seconds after I sat down.  I took her recommendation on the combo plate.  I got ribs and fried chicken leg quarter.  My two sides were mac and cheese and collard greens.  Mac and cheese was heavenly.  Collard greens were good but crazy salty.  And I'm a huge salt fan! \"One more Yuengling please.\"  Mert's is low key good old fasioned soul food cooking.  Nice work, Mert!"}
{"text":"Not the healthiest menu, but our server was really friendly and energetic.  We went for dessert, and had some delicious slices of cake -- german chocolate and caramel!"}
{"text":"Definitely a great choice for some good southern food that isn't too expensive.  I use to frequent this restaurant almost weekly before relocating to Arizona.  I must say it's one of the main things I miss about living in Charlotte.  Have yet to find a place like it (especially in Arizona)"}
{"text":"From the places I've been in Charlotte, I say it is the best Soul Food here. I went for my birthday and enjoyed the food. I do wish the restaurant was bigger seems a bit cramped in there but it has a lovely atmosphere and is nicely decorated. As usual when I rest soul food I had, fried chicken, Mac n cheese, and yams and I had no complaints."}
{"text":"This pIace earns points for (if nothing else) being open past 8pm on Sunday. I just moved uptown and was in the process of doing some unpacking when hunger struck. As I was unprepared to cook and uptown seems to become a ghost town embarrassingly early on Sunday nights I started walking, not even wanting pizza, towards Fuel thinking it the only place certain to be open. So imagine my surprise when I saw from across the street that Mert's was still open! I have very little experience with soul food but always wanted to try the place. I expected to pay a bit more than I usually would for a quick dinner but figured it would be worth it to have something different for take-out that I could pick up quickly on foot.  Price being my primary concern I ended up getting the shrimp po-boy and a side of mac and cheese. There were things that looked better but I ended up only paying about $7 and was very satisfied. Get the mac and cheese; it's delicious!"}
{"text":"If you are in downtown Charlotte and want a taste of the south Mert's is a must.  Casual atmosphere, great food, and amazing personality.  Ask for Lato'sha as she is amazing and won't lead you wrong.  Mert's is a part of Charlottes history and definitely worth the experience."}
{"text":"I had the WORST lunch of all times here today. So I just moved back from New Orleans (I am from here) and couldn't wait to go back to Merts. I had such awesome memories of it and the food was to die for. Ive been insisting for one of our coworkers to go and I finally had the chance to take her and 4 other friends. Red beans and rice tasted soooo simple, as if they were seasoned with only salt, pepper and garlic. The seasoned rice was hard :( and the ultra big hormone filled chicken wings were super plain!! Worst of all, our server gave us the worst service. Never once quality checked us. She saw a lot of our plates barely touched and didn't even think twice to ask us if anything was wrong. I was furious! I didn't leave a tip and I am a former server! I would never do that. For southern home cooking, this was an insult. Im sorry. I work to hard for my money and time and make no excuses when Im not satisfied. The worst experience on my first outing in my city. :("}
{"text":"We were in town for the Belk Bowl and went to Mert's for lunch.  It was excellent, staff was very friendly.  FYI, try the macaroni & cheese and cornbread with tHe honey butter, YUM!!!!"}
{"text":"Incredibly friendly staff, cozy atmosphere and flavorful food that will make you want to come back again and again. We came from out of town and happened upon this gem-and we are thankful we did! We had been driving all day and our dishes refueled us and we are ready to get back on the road! The ribs, and chopped bbq were packed with flavor, corn bread sent out fresh from the oven in perfect personal loafs, collard greens cooked to perfection, and yams TO DIE FOR. seriously give this place a chance!!"}
{"text":"Lives up to its great reputation. Had cheeseburger casserole, green beans, and cornbread. Bursting with flavor, hearty, comforting food. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Love the salmon cakes.  Very tasteful.  Mac n cheese is on point and so is the bread.  I really enjoyed this place.  As far as the atmosphere it is super casual.  If you want good soul food, check this place out.  Try the salmon cakes!  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Because there are so many overwhelmingly positive reviews of Mert's, there isn't too much I can write about that hasn't been already covered. In the simplest terms: The food is very good, but it does a get a little busy on the weekends, and it isn't cheap.  I've ate at Mert's three times, and I haven't had a bad meal yet. Their salmon patties are great alone, but put their remoulade sauce on it and it's perfect, seriously! Their catfish is nicely breaded and flaky, and their sides are equally wonderful too. I've tried most of them and they're all spectacular. Their soul sampler appetizer includes a soul roll, chicken tenders, and bbq ribs. Delicious, but a whopping $12. Don't expect to eat at Mert's for less than $25 for two people!"}
{"text":"This place was just OK for me.  I was pretty disappointed with the fried chicken because I felt it could have been more flavorful and more fried.  I was surprised because I would have expected more. The catfish my dad and sister ordered was way more fried than the chicken my mom and me had ordered. Also, don't expect the fish to be a fillet. It's a whole fish.  Even though our server was very friendly, I was also very disappointed with him. It was rare that he came by to check on us and he had also forgotten to give us the corn bread. When he wasn't there to check on us, we resorted to asking a different waitress that walked by for boxes and the check. However, she didn't bother, probably because we weren't her table. Rudeness...  Overall experience could have been better, but at least we tried it."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here, super yummy southern biscuits!  Looks a little dingy but that's the charm."}
{"text":"Long wait times! Ordered at 7:30pm, didn't get food until 9:20pm (10min prior to closing). The restaurant is fairly small to have long wait times. The fried chicken and fried catfish were ridiculously under seasoned. I guess we had high expectations for soul food and we left very disappointed. One of our guests actually took her food to go because we were waiting so long. I will say the cornbread was amazing. We see why people were leaving large amounts of food on their plates when leaving. Disappointed..."}
{"text":"It's good but I don't understand the hype of the place. The food was average at best. I had the fried green tomatoes (too salty) and the crispy chicken (which was not crispy at all). Chicken tasted good despite the soft skin.   Service is friendly."}
{"text":"I was referred to Mert's and decided to blow off my search for the greatest calamari ever from my last trip to Charlotte...was too cold to wander around downtown.  I'll get back for calamari later.  First off, the cornbread was great!  It was moist but not mushy.  Hate cornbread that sucks all the moisture out of your mouth or is hard as a brick.    Started with fried green tomatoes -- a new item per the menu!  5 slices to the plate with yummy remoulade.  Then came the shrimp and grits.  Also really good.    Was too full for dessert but took a piece of lemon cake to go thinking that I'd eat it at the airport for breakfast.  Ended up making it all the way home with it.  Still good and very lemony.    Jerry was my waiter. He's the man!  Prompt and polite service without being overbearing."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: rhythm and blues feel!   Service: prompt and good ol  southern hospitality  Prices: reasonable between $8- $26  Food : I ordered the salmon cakes and Mac and cheese. It was okay but I've had better. The other patriots in my party seem to really enjoy their entrée selection.   All in all it wasn't gross but it was okay."}
{"text":"Time for a little Soul!!  I live Merts and that wonderful corn bread. Tonight's menu chicken fried steak for the man and 3 sides for me. Of course the sides must include macaroni and cheese. Yum  Saving room for one of their 10 cake choices  more on that later..."}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan. The service was awesome, prices were right and the food was filling. We went for brunch and walked into a mostly empty restaurant. The sweet potato pancake had a unique texture, a bit on the sweet side (no syrup necessary), but delish. The biscuits were buttery and flaky. Awesome. The Shrimp Creole omelette was tasty and really filling. It was filled with shrimp and topped with a spicy tomato based sauce. Skip the OJ - it's the gross concentrate kind. A great down-home Southern restaurant tucked away in Uptown."}
{"text":"Go see Quesha for your soul fix! We sat on the patio and it was just perfect! We beat the rush inside and it was quiet. Loved the people watching. The food was just like \"in the kitchen\" The special was cinnamon pancakes and of course we had to try them. The corn bread was off the charts. The collards were cooked just right. Ok...it was all good. Catfish and the jumbo chicken wings were the best. Did I mention the Mac n cheese. The one I wasn't crazy about was the blackened pork chops. But the banana pudding cake pushed us over the top. We definitely got our soul on today and are feelin' good! Thanks for the great server!!!!"}
{"text":"It's okay!! The service is really bad. They take forever to come to the table and greet. Drinks of water take at least 20 mins... It's ridiculous. Been here twice and each time slow slow service. The food (breakfast) was ok. I got the French toast... Very bland. Who brings out French toast to the table without syrup ... And it took awhile for the syrup to be brought out. The soul rolls are good. But I wanted be back for awhile. Definitely the service needs to improve."}
{"text":"Good good, nice staff.  Down home food with big portions.  Complementary cornbread was nice."}
{"text":"Based on the previous reviews i was super excited to eat here. However i was a bit disapointed. Fried chicken was kind of bland but nice and juicy and the fried catfish was kind of soggy. Mac and cheese and greens were very good. Service was slow."}
{"text":"I wish I could give a negative star number. The worst restaurant experience I have ever had. We waited over an hour and never got our food. When I asked at about an hour after we arrived what was wrong, the response was \"We are very busy.   I'll talk to you in a few minutes.\"  When several tables that had come in 30-45 minutes after us got their food and still no one apologized or told us what was wrong we left.   They didn't even seem to care!  Maybe I shouldn't have left money on the table to cover our drinks. .. Maybe then they would have cared.   I'll never try this place again!"}
{"text":"I went here with my family on a Friday night.  There were six adults and two kids.  We went early, about 6:30 - 7 to avoid the rush.  We parked in the garage in the same block.  The fee is validated by the restaurant.  I was very excited to try this place because my family has eaten here before and said they love it. The first thing I noticed was the floor, is was so slippy from grease that I almost fell even wearing flat shoes.  The second thing I noticed was that our waitress was just not having it that night.  She apparently didn't feel like smiling, talking, or having any patience that night.  She was so unfriendly that my uncle actually thanked her for taking the time to take our order to try to lighten her mood.  At least that made her smile. As we waited for our food I noticed two more things...the decors is pretty cool; a lot of signed and framed broadway show posters and antique bicycles, and the corn bread is amazing.  I ordered their famous salmon cakes since 1. they are famous 2. I love crab cakes 3. I love salmon. Unfortunately I did not care for them.  The flavor was really fishy and the texture was pasty.  Having cats as pets, this entree really reminded me of their canned food.  My sides were the collard green and macaroni and cheese.  This was the cheesiest and most comforting comfort macaroni I have ever had.  My husband ordered the special of the night which was pork chops stuffed with apple corn bread.  He loved it.  I sampled some of the kids' chicken tenders which were hands down the best chicken tenders I've ever had.  I even enjoyed them cold the next day.  I was not surprised that the floor was like an oil slick being that many menu items were fried.  During our dining experience the servers sang a birthday song to a customer at another table.  It was the best birthday song I've ever heard at a restaurant.  The servers were enjoying themselves singing too.  Overall my family was satisfied with their meals.  The quantity is large and the prices are low.  I took a piece of sweet potato cake home and shared it the next day with my kids.  It was still very moist and delicious.  It is so dense that it was easily shared three ways among us.  I would go back to Mert's but I do not recommend their famous salmon cakes."}
{"text":"This place is a must-go for me when in Charlotte.  Great Southern food, good service, very reasonable prices (considering the location of the restaurant)....I really can't think of anything negative to say about Mert's.  My husband and I have visited here twice now on our two most recent visits to Charlotte. Both times I ordered the salmon cakes, which as others have mentioned, are very tasty and with the remoulade are even better. The portions are large and it is hard to finish a plate. I also love the mac and cheese (very cheesy) and the collards. My husband is a big fan of the fried chicken, saying it was some of the best he has had at a restaurant.  I also love the cornbread that they bring out before the meal. The bread is sweet and the pieces are also large. Our service here has been very attentive and friendly.  I highly recommend this place to anyone who likes good Southern food!"}
{"text":"Slow service con this cold and wet Monday. The servers just didn't have it together and neither did the cooks as my chicken was seasonless and my Mac and cheese was cold. The only thing you can expect from Mert's is inconsistency."}
{"text":"It was great. Our waitress was definitely a good host. I highly recommend this place if your in Charlotte. Mac and cheese was on point. I didn't care for the collard greens but overall we all enjoyed our meal and service."}
{"text":"In truth, being from the North, I have had very little opportunities to have \"soul food\" so there's a decent possibility that I don't like the cuisine so please take my review with a grain of salt...  The service and atmosphere at Mert's are terrific.  Fast, super friendly, casual and comfortable are some words that come to mind when I consider both.  The food was also pretty good too... BBQ Beef Ribs - really good...tasty and tender...get em Fried Chicken - pretty good, I've definitely had better, but I like the light batter Corn Bread - order extra Mac 'n Cheese - yummy crispy crust Red Beans - decent...should have tried the collard greens Salmon Cakes - surprisingly fishy...not sure if they're made with fresh or canned salmon Peach Cobbler - not good...had an off-putting under taste and smell...almost as if it was spoiled  All in all a very large and filling meal for around $25; and for the most part a pretty good one too."}
{"text":"Wowzers!! Where do I start?! This place is amazing. Soul food / Comfort food at its finest. I had the salmon cakes, made with what seemed to be fresh salmon, very soft and smooth middle consistency crunchy outside. & OMGosh, the cheese grits .. I'm not huge on everyone's grits BUT I would come here everyday for a bowl of there's, there pretty amazing! My bf got the shrimp and grits & again .. I'm not a savory grits (I like my grits sweet) kinda gal so I rarely order shrimp and grits.... but OH MY! The rue/gravy that these shrimp and grits are swimming in makes you wanna smack ya mama! Lol. Jk. Anyways!! I said all that to say, I'll definitely be back to Merts! Great service, short wait time on food for Sunday 12noon brunch spot! Give it a try, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing, and the service isn't bad. I adore their fresh cakes and the vibe of the restaurant. I have told many people about this place and they all adore it as well. Honestly, some days the servers are extremely nice, and other days you they have minor attitudes but we all have those days."}
{"text":"Tried it for the 1st time last night, I decided on getting something to go. I had the salmon cakes, the cabbage, and the mac & cheese. Loved every bit of it, driving back to the house the food smelled so good--so it passed the smell test (LOL) & it passed the taste test. It smelled like your grandmother's or mother's kitchen! I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"More than 300 reviews?  I'll keep this short and yes, SWEET!  Mert's was a super fun, super food stop during a short visit to Charlotte.  The place was hoppin' with activity, and the waitresses kept everyone happy by moving orders and food along with zip.  Lots of fun wall decor, table decor, everywhere decor - evoking joy and longing for home comforts - just like the food they serve.  Nothing fancy, just yummy catfish, lots of southern \"sides\", and cooked just right.  A fun place to take guests, family, and to give your tastebuds a refresher course in southern home cooking.  Get yourself on down there!  Even we vegetarian/pescatarians can find plenty to enjoy here..."}
{"text":"Great place!! My Dad and Uncle loved the lamb chops. Red beans and rice were magnificent!!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat in Charlotte!  I swear they must sneak my grandmother down from heaven to work in the kitchen.  Great Southern food and lovely service.  They first time In was there they refused to serve my friend a salad, insisting on fresh southern veggies instead.  They were just kidding I think."}
{"text":"Excellent fried chicken, mac and cheese, collards, green beans, yams, and sweet potato cake and it's priced right too!"}
{"text":"This place is ok.  It can be crowded (meaning you could be waiting) and the service is not great.  The food was fine, but personally I prefer my soul food to be less upscale (read less overpriced)."}
{"text":"Took my boyfriend for first time.  Waitress kept going outside smoking and smelled like ashtray upon returning to table.  Cornbread good.  Chicken good.  BBQ was disgusting and swimming in grease.  Potato salad was also old tasting and could not eat.  I was embarrassed that I had bragged to my bf about how good things were and then had such a terrible experience.   And it was over $30 for lunch.  Not worth the drive, parking, or time."}
{"text":"Was in town for a hockey game and went here twice in one weekend! Creole omelet with shrimp was awesome--order it with extra creole sauce! The fried whiting platter with remoulade sauce  was AMAZING! I had yams and home fries for my sides, plus some of the best cornbread and honey butter on the planet. Great staff, chill atmosphere--all kinds of memorabilia on the wall plus the old school jams playing in the background! Will definitely go back the next time I am in Charlotte! If you're in town, make sure Mert's is on your list of things to do!"}
{"text":"I ordered takeout from this restaurant. I got 3 fried wings, collard greens, and mac and cheese. Overall it was good. Not the best soul food I've had but definitely worth eating when you're in the area. I was able to order online which is convenient working in an office. When I arrived my food was ready and still fairly warm which I appreciate. There is a big lunch crowd but again I didn't have any issues when I arrived to pickup my food.   The fried chicken was the best part of the meal. it was fried perfectly and tasted great not overpowering at all.   The collard greens were good, not the best I've had yet good. They normally come topped with tomatoes and onions. I requested mine on the side.   The macaroni and cheese, was subpar. I expected a little better coming from a soul food restaurant nonetheless I ate it.   Again, overall this restaurant was good and I def will be recommending it to my friends and all others that visit Charlotte."}
{"text":"I love this place.  This is my favorite restaurant in all of Charlotte.  The food is great, the service is exceptional and friendly, and the atmosphere is unpretentious.  I highly recommend Mert's."}
{"text":"Ok, so overall, I give Mert's a somewhat satisfying review and this is solely based on what I ordered today as a first timer. It wasn't phenomenal, exceptional or stellar but ok.  I'm sure there are other menu options that may fall under those categories but my food was just ok. First let me say, the customer service was excellent. Every server spoke and were very friendly.  Now about the food, most of it lacked seasoning. I ordered the soul rolls as an appetizer and Mert's Famous Salmon Cakes that comes with two sides and cornbread for my entree. My sides were collards and mac n cheese but I ordered an extra side of yams.  The soul rolls didn't touch my soul; they lacked much flavor, probably because they were filled with too many ingredients (diced chicken, black eyed peas, collard greens and rice). The salmon cakes were 100% meat and not fillers, the only problem is that they fell apart when I attempted to eat them and they could've used more seasoning.  Their remoulade sauce was excellent though.  When I make salmon cakes at home, I use seasoning, (no shade) an egg and a little panko to bind them together. The \"gourmet greens,\" (which I've named them) were cute and tasted ok minus the toppings. I've never seen diced tomatoes and onions garnished on top of collard greens.  The mac n cheese was cold and had chunks of cheese curds in it. The yams were very yummy, they were baked firmly and not mushy.  For dessert, I ordered the banana pudding cake. It was very moist and delicious, not overly sweet but they put banana chips in there which I didn't like. They had an abundance of freshly made cakes which looked absolutely delicious. They had: sweet potato, lemon, coconut, chocolate banana pudding, strawberry and another one that I can't remember.  Although I was a little underwhelmed on this visit, I would return to try something else."}
{"text":"BEST greens I've had in years....the chicken is good as well (would prefer a little more seasoning - then again I am a flavor fanatic).  Friends had the Shrimp and Grits and said it was heavenly, other's at our table fell in love with the complimentary corn bread which is sweet and sooo good."}
{"text":"I gave it four stars for a couple of reasons that don't only include the food. The service was good. We were a party of 10 and had two wait staff on a Friday night. There was no wait for a table. The atmosphere is very nostalgic and I loved the music. We stayed longer because of it. I ordered the chicken wings with cabbage and collards. It also came with cornbread; one of my favorite. The cabbage was a hit at the table. I liked the collards even though they did not taste like mine. That had a hint of vinegar and they were topped with chopped onions and tomatoes. They we slightly al dente but that was fine too since they had a good flavor. The meal came with three large whole wings that were seasoned and fried to perfection. Now for the cornbread. I happen to be an expert at this and I know each person has their preference. It was a mini loaf and slightly over cooked. The top should be light brown with no Blackmon the edges. It was more dense than cakey which is okay for me but it lacked flavor. Slightly sweet which is okay too. My issue was that it did not come hot. They whipped butter just sat on it when I cut it open. Overall the table enjoyed their meals and I would come again if only for the veggies."}
{"text":"Great place in Charlotte! I had the three veggie plate and the chicken tenders. I got the mashed potatoes and gravy, Mac n Cheese and cabbage. Everything was delicious and great portion size. The cornbread was fresh and sooo good!! The batter on the chicken was just perfect. Everyone was super friendly and helpful as well. Would definitely come back and recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Soul Food gone Gourmet!!!  Walking by Mert's on my way to the Epicenter, then on my way out of the Epicenter I decided to eat here and am very glad I did!  It was a hot day and I asked for a lot of water - She brought me TWO!!!  I drank almost three!  They were real busy and I sat at a table with two ladies I had never met before (very cool and bold for the waitress to do instead of making me wait)! Though the place was packed the service was \"Faster than a Speeding Ticket\" and great!  Everyone was very friendly and seemed to be happy to be there!  Here is what I had for lunch today:  Corn Bread like CAKE with butter!  Jerk Seasoned Chopped Pork Barbecue with their \"Secret Sauce\".  Macaroni and Cheese (the Baked kind) and Collard Greens garnished with Onions, Tomatoes, and Bacon.  All made \"with Love\"  It was all Incredible!!!  For Dessert I had Fried Chicken!!!"}
{"text":"Cornbread here is best I've had. BBQ is decent but the fried chicken was soggy and lacked flavor. I've had better in California. Not the best soul food representation for the south."}
{"text":"Love this place. Went with a group of 7 for a Sunday dinner before a flight food was awesome so was the service."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate her on a Sunday afternoon. We were seated quickly, but it took a while for the waitstaff to come and take our order. After that the food came quickly, we both ordered the jumbo wings which came with 2 sides and corn bread. The sides we had were mac and cheese, black and peas, okra and tomatoes, and yams. The mac and cheese was dry and it seemed as if we got the last servings in the pan. The okra and tomatoes were good. The black eyed peas tasted like it didn't have any seasoning added. The yams were ok. Overall we will not eat here again and to add the employees we're talking about us using a visa gift card. It made us very uncomfortable."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place but it just didn't measure up in any aspect of the food, experience or service. The waitress was pleasant but i felt kind of rushed when I ordered and once or food came she didn't come back until we wanted the bill. We ordered catfish which had little seasoning,  beef ribs which had flavor but were mostly fast and bones, collard greens that were more bitter than eating lemons. Let me add that I almost slipped in my heels walking in and out because the floor wad so greasy and covered with food. Oh let me not forget the salty peach cobbler that looked like someone laid a piece of bread on top for the crust. The peaches weren't even sweet. I'm sorry, someone told be I'd feel like i was eating at my grandma's kitchen.  On her worst day her cooking never tasted this bad. If i had to describe this place in one word \"Yuck\" would be it. I went on a Sunday.  Maybe they have better cooks through the week, but by reading some of the reviews I doubt it."}
{"text":"Soul food that make your heart smile.   Every time i visit da south for work I get excited about new bbq and soul food spots that I get to try. This place alone made my trip worth while.   Had the jumbo wings with mac and cheese, collard greens, and cornbread.Everything was delicious and had a unique touch. The collard greens were the best I've ever had.  The selection and customer service here was outstanding. They even have a phone app, how cool right ?  Can't wait to come back and get me some more Mert's."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now (The first time my living social wouldn't load so we had to return, not that we were upset about that after our first great experience!)   I think the service here is really hit or miss though, the first time we had great service, the second time a robotic like server who was actively RUDE to us after presenting our Living Social coupon. Like a toddler throwing a tantrum rude.  I understand that a lot of people might tip less when using a living social which is the pits, but we do not (and did not tip less despite her rudeness). Tip to restaurant owners: do not have a living social if your staff is going to be rude to your new customers...   The food both times has been fantastic and the mac and cheese will keep us coming back despite the hit or miss service. We generally try to come during the week to avoid the crowds and that has worked so far for getting a table pretty quickly. Probably won't be a regular spot, but I wouldn't say that we'll never return.    So, Food: 5/5, Service 2-3/5 (depending on your server) for an average of 3/5  or 4/5 on a good night."}
{"text":"Wonderful soul food.  The collards have a unique taste, with the onion and tomatoes on top.  Mac-N-Cheese is solid, A-1 and the chicken is great.  They don't offer barbecued chicken, but you can order this barbecue sauce they put on the chicken for you (which ends up being the same) at no additional cost and it is heavenly.  My o-n-l-y complaint is that sometimes the door staff can be a bit too comfortable with you; leading to them taking their time getting you seated and on one occasion, one waitress (older lady) being very snappy with my mother and stepfather, who were visiting for the holidays.  That was very embarrassing.  I don't know if things get a little out of order, or what, but that can become very frustrating.  Other than this happening on a few occasions, this place is great!"}
{"text":"Merts is considered \"the\" place for soul food in Charlotte. It gets a lot of traffic based on location (visitors, convention goers, sporting event attendees), but there is better soul food to be had outside the center city."}
{"text":"I love that this place is open and serving dinner until 11 or midnight.  That's hard to find in Uptown unless you are at the epicenter.  The food - well, mixed bag.  The beef short ribs..tasty, but nothing to write home about.  My girlfriend and I both had the red beans and rice with roasted turkey....now when you hear roasted turkey what do you think?  I'll wait a minute while you ponder this......well what we got was turkey sausage...it was bizarre.  It was sliced and didn't taste bad, but we were confused.  Actually waited several minutes for our waitress to come back to check on us - we asked if we'd gotten the wrong meals..she said no.  Well, it took her so long to come back that by the time we dug in our food was only warm...now that's on us I guess...but, the food was luke warm and bland.  I never reach for hot sauce..and I reached for it here.  The desserts...now those were on point.  The coconut cake - best i've had beyond Red Rocks.    So to recap:  Food - 2 stars Desserts - 4 stars  For an avg of 3 stars."}
{"text":"Mert's has my favorite collard greens and corn bread in Charlotte.  The salmon cakes are delicious as are the pork chops.  Fried chicken is above average, although not as delicious as the previous two entrees mentioned."}
{"text":"We waited for an hour and a half before receiving our food, the reason was because they were waiting on my macaroni and cheese.  When my Mac and cheese and ribs came out there was barely any meat and it was definitely not a half rack like advertised.  In fact there was no \"rack,\" this was because they were off the bone pork ribs which was not explained in the menu, there was also no meat.  There is no way that macaroni should have taken and hour, as that and my boyfriend's food was on par with public school cafeteria food.  The only thing that was remotely redeeming was the cornbread, that was good.  The server was a sweetheart as well and took care of our bill because she recognized that the wait was ridiculous.  Much love to her.  How this place got 4.5 stars out of 5 I'll never know.  P.S.  My boyfriend and I are currently doubled over in abdominal pain, so that food was bad on many levels..."}
{"text":"It's all #GuyFerrari fault!  I follow Drive Diner Dives he raved about this place. I live NYC so I was excited about eating southern food since I was born in the south...but my entire family was disappointed. (party of 4)  Let's start with the Pro's:  Appretizer: Fried Tomatoe ***, Salmon Cakes***,Cornbread***** stole the show ---the Best!  Fried Chicken Wings***, not winget were nicely seasoned. Fried Whiting ****,  Collard Greens - Alright **  Con's, Sides need much improvement: Steam Cabbage tasted like it was cooked in dirty butter water  negative Star* awful (Sorry) Green Beans - taste sweet, did you put suger in them (no-no)- negative Star Seasoned Yellow Rice was just Yellow ----LOL Blackeyed Pea - just blackeyed peas, nothing special Side salad, was so small it belonged on top of slider Blackend Salmon was over cooked, super dry!  Plus I think, the food was cooked with MSG, because I got a food headache...theres a differance.   My waiter was very pleasent!  The place was nice and clean and I enjoyed the atmospher. But you must pay to park. :(  @GuyFerrari, I'm sending you my Diner Bill!"}
{"text":"While visiting Charlotte for the DNC, I must say that Merts made me feel as if I never left home.  I dined there for breakfast and two dinners.  For breakfast I had two eggs, bacon, biscuits and home fries.  Everything was very enjoyable but where Merts really shines is at night.  For dinner, I had the salmon cakes on one occasion and the fried catfish on the other.  On the side, I had yams and greens and a sweet tea to wash it all down.  I managed to save enough room for dessert and enjoyed a slice of sweet potato cake.  The cake was moist and delicious and the frosting was nothing short of decadent.  Merts portions are huge.  If only my hotel had a mini fridge, I could have taken my leftovers back to my room.  The wait staff is super friendly.  As for its location, Merts is very convenient to lots of hotels in downtown Charlotte."}
{"text":"We had high expectations, but the food was overly salted. Thumbs down on the soul rolls from us. The corn bread was our favorite and the service was great. Another plus - huge portions!"}
{"text":"Had to get some comfort food while visiting my sister in Charlotte. And I found it at Mert's! Everything was great. From the Mac&Cheese to the yams. The girls and I decided on the place for a Saturday night dinner. I enjoyed the friend whiting fish, Mac & cheese with Collard greens. I also snacked on the crab cakes my best-friend ordered. I had a sweet tea. Which was perfect. And just as good as the food. The waitress was kind and the food came out hot and pretty fast. We took some pictures and added them to my Instagram page. And then devoured our food lol. I enjoyed my dinner here at Mert's. I shall return!!!"}
{"text":"I know a lot of y'all love this place. I'm sorry but I cannot jump on the bandwagon. I'm an Alabama girl and I know good soul food. This isn't it. Every time I've been here the food has been over seasoned and over cooked. For example, crab cakes are not supposed to be black and hard on the bottom.   I will say that I like the corn bread and some of the desserts like the peach cobbler.  The service is also very good. And the servers were super cool every time I went.  I just wish the food was better so I could rave about this place like the rest of you."}
{"text":"Well, this was my first meal in Charlotte, and it kicked my trip off right.  First off, the cornbread may be the very best I have ever had. Perfect texture, a little salty, a little sweet, and hot. Add some sweet butter, and holy moly!  We stopped in for lunch, and the service was a little slow, but there was a huge party, so that impacted things a bit. I had the chopped pork, steamed cabbage, and mashed potatoes.  The only thing that disappointed was the gravy. Everything else was so, so good.  The whole deal, including iced tea was $8.00, which is not far off what we pay for mcdonald's back home.  Yum!"}
{"text":"3.5 to 4 stars for food, but towards a 2.5 star for service. We ordered take-out at around 4:45pm on Saturday and got incredibly lousy service.   The two of us stood at the door waiting for someone to come to the front for about 5 minutes. Then, when someone finally came, they started to seat everyone else before even noticing my dining companion and I. When they figured out we were going to order take-out, they shafted us to the side and told us they'd take our order later. Another 10 minutes went by and they just kept seating people. FINALLY, 15 minutes after we'd entered the store, someone found the time to take our orders at the register. We then waited another 20 minutes for our food to get cooked and packaged to go. Luckily, we weren't hungry...  I ordered the salmon with cajun seasoning and sides of collard greens and okra. For $16, the salmon and sides were just an \"OK\" value for money. The salmon was at least 4 - 5 oz but the cajun flavors were much more bland than I remembered them to be. The collard greens were good! Sweet and flavorful with its texture being soft but not mushy. The okra was on the sour side and probably not something I would order again, but still tasted okay.   The cornbread was actually a HUGE disappointment. I consider myself a cornbread lover and expert. I don't mind them dry, moist, sweet or salty just as long as it has good flavor. Mert's was neither sweet nor salty...if anything it may have been the blandest cornbread I'd ever tasted. Dry on the outside, moister on the inside...but still not enough to make it interesting enough to eat. I almost NEVER leave cornbread behind, and yet for Mert's...I left maybe 80% behind.   Maybe eating at the restaurant would have given me a different / better experience. I just wouldn't order takeout if I were you."}
{"text":"The soul rolls were really good as was the salmon cakes and yams.  Our party of six (two kids) really enjoyed Mert's."}
{"text":"The service was not as good as it should have been. Ordered catfish and wings but only received wings. Asked for sweet tea 3 times. When I finally got it I loved it. The chicken and mac n cheese was ok the cornbread and potato salad was delicious."}
{"text":"I truly enjoyed their fried chicken. It was almost the best I have ever had. Cabbage was slightly bland but a small dab if hot sauce fixed that."}
{"text":"Mert's is a quality uptown soul food joint that keeps me coming back, expecting more and usually getting it. I've licked my fingers to their beef ribs, generously garnished in their house BBQ sauce. I also love their cornbread, not quite up to Mom's, but a far sight better that many one might fine in a similar restaurant, and It has always been hot when served to me, always a plus. Mert's does their wings up right, large and in charge, providing big chicken eating to a big appetite.  Always worthy of a return visit. I also love their old school atmosphere, as they keep your attention, scanning the walls for something new that you might have missed on a previous visit. I have found the staff friendly and most attentive to your wants, especially when the hot sauce runs out..."}
{"text":"This place is so satisfying! If you haven't already heard, but their cornbread is seriously the best I've ever had! It's so moist and light and the honey butter that comes with it... Oh my goodness. My mouth waters every time I think about their famous cornbread! Their salmon cakes is so yummy too, I always start with them as an appetizer when I come in! Service is great and helpful, very friendly. Refills are a must for me, and they always keep my drinks full! Can't wait to come back to Mert's soon!"}
{"text":"I had the beef ribs and fried chicken combo/ mac n cheese &greens side My wife had fried catfish and fried chicken combo/ potato salad $ fries side my daughter had the kid chicken tenders/mac n cheese & fries side. Were from south Jersey and have eaten at a lot of restaurants of all kinds. Hands down this is the best tasting soul food restaurant we've eaten at yet. We will be back for seconds and thirds. Excellent taste and portions absolutely nothing to complain about even the price was reasonable. You've gotta try this place if you can."}
{"text":"As always, Merts serves up a great atmosphere and fantastic food! The BBQ was tender and flavorful. Steamed cabbage is highly recommended.  Gonna take home a slice a coconut cake and savor it."}
{"text":"Went to Mertz to have dinner because of the high yelp ratings. We wanted to dine in but the  service was so slow (10 minutes and we were still in the front waiting to be seated) that we just ordered for take out. We ended up ordering the blackened pork chops and chicken soup. The soup was too salty and had to much bay leaf. The blackened pork chops were too dry. The Mac and cheese were ok and the yams were good."}
{"text":"We go here for brunch almost weekly for the best made-from-scratch biscuits. Both service and atmosphere reflect true southern style. A hidden gem in the uptown area."}
{"text":"I want to give this place no stars but it's not an option.  I heard this was \"THE\" soul food restaurant to eat at.  First,  the staff was not friendly and we were ignored for 10mins. I ordered the omlette and home fries, they both were awful. I then ordered the fried chicken,  collard greens and mac & cheese.  The chicken was not seasoned,  the greens were tough, and the mac & cheese was flavorless. Then to top it off the cornbread was dry and burnt. As if that wasn't enough we have felt sick since we ate there."}
{"text":"Ordered the Catfish Dinner plate. My collard greens weren't good at all, the Catfish was very soggy...in fact it felt as though I was eating mush!!!! He Cornbread was the best thing and Mac was okay. I wouldn't recommend his dish but maybe others are okay."}
{"text":"Mert's is very good soul food. Came here with a friend last week. It took a minute for the cornbread to come out because it was hot and fresh out the kitchen. I'm not a big cornbread fan, but slap some butter on this stuff and it's quite amazing.  Our server recommended the ribs, and so I ordered them with the yardbird, mac and cheese and greens. All around great. The ribs were falling off the bone, the yardbird and very good. The mac and cheese was stellar and the greens were some of the best I've tasted in North Carolina.  I finished my meal with the peach cobbler, which was fine, but not great. I kinda wished they had more chocolate options here. I would most certainly come here again."}
{"text":"Oh Mert's what a great place for me to checkout on my trip to Charlotte. I wanted some hardcore authentic bbq and Mert's was my destination of choice.  I ordered their legendary ribs, a side of pulled pork, collared greens and a slice of cornbread.  The ribs were great, hearty, fresh and tasty all around cooked to perfection. I was also a big fan of the collared greens, they were the best I have ever tasted.  Mert's is an awesome spot located right in downtown Charlotte. You really can't go wrong with choosing Mert's, everything on their menu was great.  Had a fun time in Charlotte and an awesome meal at Mert's!"}
{"text":"There's not much to be said about this place that's not written already. Walked in to this place in a seemingly nicer part of the neighborhood. The inside was dark and had an old feeling to it. Typical t shirt and jeans kinda place. Ladies, do not get dolled up to come here. You will not be noticed. Not only will the darkness overshadow you, your partners will also be distracted by the amazing food to even care about your existence at that moment.   Fried chicken: outside was crispy and perfect. Just enough grease on it to leave a shimmer on your fingers. Cooked perfectly. A little tug to it. The only way this could have been better was to add some lawry's to it before coating it.   Collard greens: idc what race or ethnicity u are, you will love it. Not too wet. Just enough taste of ham hocks in there. Yea. Good.   Okra tomato think: looked diarrhea in the bowl. Tasted like heaven. I wasn't expecting that flavor to come out of this, but it hits u like heroine.  U keep wanting more.   Mac and cheese: fuck yea. 2nd best I've ever had in my life. (Smoque in Chicago has it barely beat)  The cornbread: THE BEST CORNBREAD I'VE EVER HAD!!!!!!! I won't even tell u why. Go figure it out yourself.    Bottom line: you want good southern soul food that I would stereotypically assume what soul food is, go here. It's that damn good."}
{"text":"Best soul food I've experienced in a long time. Mac cheese, green beans and the salmon cakes OMG!!!! GREAT TASTE, reasonable price, very casual and perfect location in Uptown to walk around after you're full!!!"}
{"text":"Best cake I've had since my grandmother was alive.   This place is AMAZING. Seriously. I just left and I'm dying at how good everything was. Between our orders we had salmon cakes, blackened pork chops, yams, mac and cheese, and collards. Oh, and sweet potato cake and peach cobbler. All fire.   Take me back please."}
{"text":"Fried Chicken is the pick here.  Either the big breast or the individual wings...either is spot on.  Grilled Pork Chops is good. All the sides are good as well as the Corn Bread."}
{"text":"Not the best soul good I've ever eaten. My collard greens mixed with mustards? Were tough. The fried chicken was standard not anything to rave about. Salmon cakes were good. Mac n cheese can pass for soul food. Yams were great! Corn bread mediocre, overall it was okay. Don't believe the hype, especially if you were brought up on Mamas soul food cooking."}
{"text":"Small but Very nice atmosphere. However, I have several concerns/ suggestions. First if they're over crowded you can't wait in side even if it's rain, sleet or snow. Secondly, they should take your number and text when you're table is ready. The menu is short limited southern options. Ok now the food it took a while to get a food by the way. The Mac n cheese was lacking seasoning along with the greens, and the CHICKEN . It needs a little bit more work to be called southern food. It's not your grandmas or your aunts cooking. The corn bread sets the bar very high because it's so good but everything else failed short. The cat fish is a no go and bad presentation. Even though the food wasn't so great The service is so nice and I would come back an support black owned business anytime."}
{"text":"Omg so good! Healthy (ok. Kinda') soul food. Great service, very fair prices, and tasty food. What else could you want in Charlotte?? They make it good!! Very close to the venue we were attending and quick service allows for no stress about getting to the plane on time. Loved it!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to Mert's Heart & Soul while in Charlotte, NC looking to try some soul food that was well known in the city.  When we arrived we could see the place was crowded but were seated within a few minutes.  We ordered the Fried Green Tomato since we never had it before and it was very good.  We also tried the Soul Rolls which were also good.  For my daily fixins I ordered the Fried Cat Fish while my girlfriend had Mert's Famous Salmon Cakes.  We were happy with our food including the sides of macaroni & cheese, okra, mashed potatoes, and collard greens.  We also tried a slice of coconut cake.  The only thing we didn't like was that the restaurant seemed a bit dirty.  Overall, we really liked the food here and would recommend it to anyone looking for quality soul food."}
{"text":"Great southern comfort food! Felt like I was back home in my grandma's kitchen. Delicious food! Cornbread is to die for. Grilled pork chops, steamed cabbage and black eye peas were amazing. The atmosphere is simple, quaint and even quiet and the food was fulfilling and flavorful. Not overly salty eitherThe service was top notch. Extremely friendly and full of smiles. I will be back."}
{"text":"Here for my annual trip to Charlotte and this time I knew where to go for a good Gullah meal. I went with my teammates for a celebration meal and was introduced to Okra & Tomatoes. If you haven't tried it it's a must.  Service comes with delicious corn bread and butter or you can choose from the menu. The decor is made up of colorful walls adorned with pictures of family and friends. It can see dark in certain seating areas so have your flashlight ready. The volume is moderate so you can enjoy a conversation with your dining mates. I didn't try any of their tempting desserts.  Call ahead to find out what desserts are being served that day."}
{"text":"Visited for the first, but definitely not the last time.  I enjoyed salmon cakes with mac and cheese and yams and best cornbread I've had in a long time. Wonderful service and pleasant server.  Love the oldies music too. One recommendation, move the garbage can - it's right at the door; shouldn't be a focal point to your guests.  Love it and we'll be back."}
{"text":"The food was good. My friend said it was the best greens she has ever had!! I got the veggie platter and was satisfied. The price was reasonable, the food delish, and the bread warm! I will say that I went for Sunday brunch, and they really don't have a \"brunch\" menu. More like breakfast OR lunch. I was going to get breakfast items, but they are known for their soul food- so I ordered the SOUL FOOD! The service was good."}
{"text":"Merts fed my soul! The fried green tomatoes were delicious. Loved the black eyed peas and the okra and tomatoes was just like my family always made. I didn't care for the cabbage because I like mine seasoned with some kind of pork. The cornbread was good but I do not care for sweet cornbread. But this food will leave a great memory of my time in Charlotte, NC"}
{"text":"Sooo initially I was told it'd be 15 minutes for my to go order over the phone....try 45 minutes with no apologies! I visited 7 years ago and had great food and service. So disappointed to experience all this and on a Sunday. There was no street parking so I was forced to tip the valet at holiday for the pickup... best thing there is cornbread which reheats quite nice"}
{"text":"Great southern food spot .Ordered the jumbo chicken wings, mash potatoes, and macaroni. Food was bomb although I asked for the wings to be extra crispy , they came out and one the ends where crispy , the rest looked like baked chicken . Food came out super fast ! Food is very affordable for large portion sizes . Will be returning"}
{"text":"So we came into to this place to give it a try, wanted some soul food. Walked in and the hostess was talking to someone she knew. She greeted us and continue to talk to her friend, the other host staff acted as if we weren't standing there. She finally finishes her conversation and seats us. We wait at the table about 5 to 7 minutes before the server comes to the table. He acknowledge that  we have waited a long time and that we should probably give him our order along with our drink order. So we make our decisions. We get the drinks and never see him again. We waited 40 minutes for our food!!!! The woman who sat us, delivered our food, and she said it was hot, well I touched it and it was burnt and room temperature as well as my husband did not get his complete order. We were furious! Another woman brought syrup to the table and I asked for the manager and she just happen to be the manager. We voiced our complaints and she validated them because she said she saw us waiting and that no one had been to our table. She took the food back to the kitchen to show them and said we didn't have to pay for anything. She apologized and gave us a gift card and asked us to come back, the other lyrics reason I gave one star. We do not desire to return."}
{"text":"In town for one night and had a taste for soul food. Our Uber driver recommended Mert's. Yessss!!! Super cool atmosphere--folksy and unpretentious, delicious and entirely affordable. Go, go, go!"}
{"text":"I'm not usually a fish for breakfast kind of girl, but I didn't feel right about ordering a normal omelette at a place like this. Wow! I am so glad I ordered the catfish egg combo. This was definitely the best catfish I have ever had. The fish completely melted in your mouth and the seaoning & breading was delicious. Service was super friendly and quick. I don't have a single complaint! I will definitely stop back in on my next trip to Charlotte."}
{"text":"When my friend and I walked in, we were immediately greeted by several people. Everyone was smiling and nice, and we were given a table outside. The waitress said she could tell our chairs were uncomfortable, so she switched them for better seats. I had the beef ribs and chicken breast quarter, with yams and macaroni and cheese. The ribs were different than I typically like (vinegary maybe) and the chicken was a little dry, but I loved how it wasn't overly salty like southern food sometimes is. The cornbread was good, but not as sweet as I like. The peach cobbler was different, but good. I got it to go and forgot it in my car so I didn't eat much. It was a good lunch with beautiful weather, so I'd go back."}
{"text":"YUMM CORNBREAD. This place probably has the best cornbread I've ever had in my life. Period.  I was in town for a day, and wanted to pick up somethingfor the road. My colleagues recommended Mert's, and I'm glad I went. I ordered a catfish, collard greens, and acorn squash for me, and a beef tips, mac n' cheese, and collard greens for the special guy picking me up from the airport. I gobbled down the cornbread right away, it was so delicious. Now I know nothing tastes as good as when it's first made, but for surviving a 10-hour trip, these meals were pretty darn good.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"After eating a disappointing, overpriced dinner the night before, my group was thrilled to find this sweet spot in downtown Charlotte! We loved the quirky decor and immediately felt the warm fuzzies for our energetic waitress. We were there for breakfast, but I personally was excited to hear that there were meat and veggies choices available too. Good flavored coffee was a welcome beginning , as was the yummy cornbread and crunchy biscuits. 5 stars would have been given , but some in our party said their omelette choices were just ok. My non traditional meal of salmon patties, collard greens and home fries was yummy!  Everything was seasoned and cooked perfectly. I look forward to a return to this place.  Egg rolls filled with collards and black eyed peas and roasted veggies are on my list of things to try next time.  Gourmet soul food at its best!"}
{"text":"The way to go at Mert's  is.. To go and never come back. I went to Mert's after trying their featured food at the taste of charlotte 2017, and being delighted with what they presented. The food they served at the food festival and what they truly serve at the restaurant is completely different. It was misleading and money was wasted. I've never regretted eating at a restaurant to this extent. Their macaroni and cheese tasted like powder. Their mashed potatoes were wack. Everything was wack. the water was even wack.  This restaurant is like going to your moms friends house that doesn't cook well."}
{"text":"Finally made it out to Mert's over the weekend and wasn't disappointed. I got the salmon cakes which had solid flavor and came with a remoulade sauce that kicked them up a bit without being overwhelmingly spicy.  The cornbread was big, flaky and delicious.  Mac and cheese had more of a creamy consistency to it, with good flavor.  Green beans were also fantastic.  Huge portions - I had my leftovers for dinner. Service was a bit slow, but they were busy, so all is forgiven. Our waitress was very attentive and offered to replace a salmon cake that was a bit burned without us asking."}
{"text":"Everyone raves about the cornbread and they are right! The cornbread is very unique to Mert's. I love the fish on the menu. Also, this is a great place for breakfast. Make sure you grab a slice of cake. You won't be disappointed,"}
{"text":"I had the salmon patties, collar greens and blackeyed peas. It was absolutely delicious.  I am in town for two nights. I plan to go back for supper tomorrow."}
{"text":"Horrible service!!! Server forgot to put our order in. Came back 30 minutes later with lame lie. Another 20 minutes later still no food, not even apps. Hostess also provided 2 new lame lies. We left and will never go back. Dishonest staff ruined it for me. Honesty would  have gone over better. Went to Tupelo Honey Cafe instead. Awesome service and FOOD!!"}
{"text":"CORN BREAD!!  CAKE BAR!!  LEMON CAKE!!  Now that I've gotten that out of my system......  I love soul food!  I don't eat it often, but when I do I want it to feel like Sunday dinner.  Mert's did that for me.  I ordered the beef ribs and was a little disappointed, but that's what happens when you live in the BBQ capital of the world for about 8 years (TX).  Aside from that, the sides were just as good as it gets.  I love that they cook their greens with vinegar which is such a southern thing.  I threw a couple of drops of Texas Pete on there and my taste buds were in heaven.  Their famous salmon cakes were a bit dry for my taste.  Maybe I caught a bad batch, but I'd like to believe that they can be waaay more tender and moist.  The wait staff were so funny and friendly.  I felt completely at home.  I'm hoping they expand soon because seating does get tight!  We were seated by the exit door and on a 30 something degree night it literally takes the warmth away from the atmosphere and my food, lol!  I don't care what any of the nay-sayers say, Merts is good stuff!  If you want to see things get better for next time, just say so.  Yelp is powerful and most businesses take what we say to heart as long as it's constructive and comes from a place of caring and not cynicism."}
{"text":"Cornbread should be cake it so sweet Collard greens had to be the worst I have ever had. No flavor come straight out of a bag and ever little cooking to them and no seasoning Beef ribs touch cold and the worst bbq I have ever tasted My salad was serviced in a tea cup plate. It was a joke The food came cold and tasteless This place is not worth what the price for the bad food you get  My first........and my LAST PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY  16.00 LATER AND NOW I HAVE TO GO GET SOMETHING I CAN EAT!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Had a pretty good Groupon for this place- wife enjoyed the collards, fried chicken was finger licking good. Avoid the soup which was reaally a cup of broth. And steer clear of the Carolina Blond beer yuck. Loved our sassy southern waitress & the corn bread she brought us. We will be back."}
{"text":"I really, really wanted to like this place.  But unfortunately, when I was served chicken that was not fully cooked inside, that really just nose-dived this place to 2 stars.  We were recommended this place by a local coworker of mine since I was in Charlotte on business.  Apparently this is the place to go for some good ole greasy soul food.  BF and I started off with the salmon cakes appetizer ($7.60) which were delicious!  The \"remoulade\" sauce that it comes with is perfect with the salmon.  I ordered the southern fried chicken leg with collard green and mac n cheese ($8.79).  BF ordered the fried catfish with collard greens and mac n cheese($15).  And all meals come with a piece of their infamous corn bread -- which was easily the best cornbread that I'd ever had.  Everything was great until I got into the center of my chicken, where it was uncooked at the bone.  Our waitress came to check on us and saw my chicken and started to apologize profusely.  She took my entire plate and said she would get me a new chicken leg.  On the way to the kitchen, she showed another waitress the leg and they both started shaking their heads.  She eventually came back with a fully cooked chicken leg at no extra charge which was cool, but I was almost full since I had eaten almost half of my previous chicken before I got to the raw part.  The rest of the food was great and the prices were definitely favorable, but it was unfortunate that I ended up with the uncooked chicken.  Not sure if I'd come back next time I am in Charlotte on business."}
{"text":"Sunday morning the cornbread hits the spot.  The rest of the meal, food and service, was mediocre at best. To tell the truth, the service ran along the lines of pretty poor. We sat outside and the tables around us were annoyed with the bad service too. Actually the woman at the table of three directly across from us kept telling customers to \"go away\" when they came dine. She also was served the wrong meal but no one ever came back to check on her.  We started the meal with the fried green tomatoes - Fresh green tomatoes battered in a herb and flour blend, lightly fried to perfection and served with our own remoulade sauce - it was served with our cornbread and the server said she would return with side plates but never did. She never refilled our drinks either. The fried green tomatoes had a very heavy batter on them. It was hard to find \"tomatoes\" in the dish. I would resist trying this appetizer.  We waited a long time for our main course which is why it was probably cold when it arrived at our table. Scott had the special beef tip omelet with potatoes. He had asked for wheat toast but we were told they had none and they would bring white. They never bought the toast or asked if his meal was good. I tried the Mert's famous salmon cakes. These were dry and cold and my sides the macaroni & cheese - tasty - and okra & tomatoes - greasy? - were also suffering from being left sitting waiting for someone to bring them to our table.   After finally chasing someone down inside we got our check. With all the options in the neighborhood to try we probably won't add this to our list of great places to dine."}
{"text":"If you're new to Charlotte and still adjusting to living in the New South, go to Mert's Heart & Soul in uptown. I can pretty much guarantee that the macaroni and cheese, sweet tea, biscuits, meatloaf and all the other soul food will remind you why Charlotte is a good place to live.   You can order food from Mert's online, which is a convenient perk. I've been to a couple events catered by Mert's. Mm mm."}
{"text":"You can't help but love this joint and the food that they serve. Best. Biscuits. Ever!"}
{"text":"The service never goes wrong in North Carolina.  Everyone is always so damn nice!  I was looking for decent Southern food  in the downtown area..and this place has got it all!  I got an order of fried chicken (leg/dark meat) with grits and collard greens as sides.  The chicken was not deeeep fried.  Baked and juicy with crispy skin.  Sides were standard for NC quality (This is a compliment.  I will not be able to find this in the Northeast!).  On top of it all, they give you hot, soft, delicious complimentary cornbread."}
{"text":"i was actually disappointed. my friends had raved about merts... and i like my mom's ribs better. i had a 2 meat combo, and they were just dry. the mac and cheese was disappointing. the food was too rich (i can't believe that I would say anything like that) and greasy... the cake was WAAAAAY too sweet.... i dunno.   the service was fantastic, and the location was super convenient, especially if you are staying at the holiday inn. but overall... this isn't a place i was recommending."}
{"text":"My how they've changed. More than disappointed.  I didn't write a review the last time because I was hoping it was a fluke. However, it's not. The service is always great. But the food is just not the same. I had the fried chicken meal and both my chicken and side items seemed tasteless. The lemonade was fresh but lacked sugar. Not sure what happened but my family was disappointed overall with their meals. Ok but not good."}
{"text":"Wow is this place amazing!! Some of the best derive in the city!! Everyone was very kinda and friendly. The corn bread was drop dead amazing, chicken tenders and potato salad all felt someone's grandma was cookin it up in the back!! Rhasaan waited on up and helped up pick out all the best things on the menu and we left with sweet potato cake!!"}
{"text":"We came to eat dinner here because we love BBQ restaurants. It was wonderful! My husband had bbq pork and I had salmon cakes. So good! The sides were all good. I wish I had room for cake but I was too full. The staff was great. They really hustle to get people seated and served. I'd definitely go again."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for the first time yesterday, & liked it! Their menu has all of the traditional soul foods one would expect, the servers were nice, the food was very tasty, the portion sizes are BIG, & the prices are economical. We'd definitely go back & recommend it to others."}
{"text":"The anticipation for this visit was high. I had heard nothing but great things about Mert's. I must say the Food was fantastic. The cornbread was like something your grandmother made and a very large portion with a side of sweet butter. I got the fried chicken with greens and beans. The chicken was crispy and to die for. The greens were just succulent. Now, the food was great but the dining experience was ruined due to terrible service. The minute we walked in and were greeted by a server with an attitude I knew this might be dreadful. Our drink orders were about 10 minutes getting to the table and we were never offered a refill. Our server just stood at the end of the table waiting to take out order but didn't speak. After we gave her our order she couldn't remember it and Asked for it again. She never made eye contact with us and was rushed even though they were not busy.   The customer service can make or break a dining experience and I can tell you we would have just left it the food wasn't so great. However, we will not be back. I hope you are able to recognize the need for a attitude change for your servers."}
{"text":"THANK YOU, Yelpers!! Maybe the best home cookin' I've eaten, and that covers a lot!  Beef spare ribs, fried chicken, shrimp & grits, salmon, collards, black eyed peas, Mac n cheese, slaw, and oh the cornbread that was served first!!  Seriously wanted a slice of one of the half doz cakes but, alas, no room. Guess we'll just have to come back.... And we sat next to a friendly lady sipping a beer in a Pilsner glass thru a straw; that's a first. Wish we could clone this place!"}
{"text":"As much of a fan as I am of \"soul food,\" I just can't seem to find the right thing at Mert's. I have tried this restaurant twice and I have been underwhelmed both times. The prices seem to be a bit high given the quality and portions of the food. This most recent visit was my return visit to use my unused Groupon of which I had purchased two a year ago. I went with the lamb at the suggestion of the server and the parts of it that were not burnt to a crisp were truly delicious. The potato salad was really good, as was the mac and cheese. The yams weren't even close to those that my Mom makes, but hey..maybe I'm biased. Part of the downfall of Mert's for me is due to the fact that I have had Lawan's and they are on a completely different level. Mert's seems almost a bit commercial to me and it seems that maybe the food isn't prepared fresh (although I did have to wait a long time).   I'm willing to give them another try, but I don't really want to pay for it so it's likely not going to happen. I love soul food and the people there were super friendly so I wish them continued success, however I'll be heading to Lawan's for my soul food fixes for now."}
{"text":"My parents came from out of town so I took them Merts for dinner. Now the hubby and I have been to Merts for lunch and dinner but this Friday was terrible! The macaroni and cheese was watered down looking like velvetta cheese, collard greens were bland, sweet tea wasn't sweet, fried chicken was soggy. Mom was hungry so she peeled the skin off and ate the meat. She also had to pick through a ton of stalks in the collard greens. I asked them if they had a new chef they said no but new prep people I'm like well y'all need to teach them something cause today's dinner was horrible. So it seems Merts is either hit or miss depending on who's cooking or not!"}
{"text":"Looking for a brunch spot before heading to the airport in Charlotte, my husband and I chose Mert's because of the reviews we read.  And it was a great find!    This place has character, from the portraits and decor, to the bathrooms to the staff.  Tthe service was great - we were visisted by at least 4 different staff members, but it was seamless.  The food also had character - I had the red beans and rice with smoked turkey.  It was just alright.  But if that was the low point of the meal, I will take it!  After reading the reviews, we had to try the sweetpotato pancakes.  WOW - they were definitely worthy of the praise!  The homefriends were also delish.  My husband had the biscuits and gravy and was fat and happy with his choice.   I am not sure that this restaurant is worth a trip back to Charlotte on its own, but we will definitely be back if we are in the area!  There are so many more things on the menu to try!!"}
{"text":"Oh yes, that cornbread with butter was SO GOOD!!  YUMMMMM!  Other than that, my friend and I both got the fried chicken with two sides.  The fried chicken was pretty solid, as was the potato salad!  The mac 'n cheese was alright-I feel like I always get excited to have mac 'n cheese as a side dish wherever I go, but it's hardly ever amazing (when will I learn to give that up??).  Anyways, the service was quick and friendly.  It was pretty packed here, but there was luckily no wait on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"I had the beef short ribs, collards and Opera n tomatoes.  Collards are the best. Never had em with chopped onion and chopped maters b4 but that's fixin to b standard at our house. Just a hint of vinegar and spice. Really good.  Okra n maters were great too. Cooked tender - crisp. Not mushy or slimy.  Beef short ribs were well done and seasoned moderately.  You can always put hot sauce on if you want more heat. Texas Pete, Cholula n an oriental offering were on the table.  The wife had fried chicken breast quarter, collards n black eyes.  The chicken was OK but not great. It was a bit over done and had a bit of an old oil taste.  The peas had a peculiar herb flavor that neither of us has tasted b4. That didn't work for us. She loved the collards.  The cornbread n butter were great.  I tried a Carolina Blonde ale that the waitress described as a cream ale.  It was more like an India pale ale. It was good.  The service was prompt, pleasant and timely. Food was served quickly.  Prices were very reasonable. Unusual for a downtown restaurant, especially in the tony hotel neighborhood.  Overall, a pleasant early dinner."}
{"text":"The worst restaurant ever! It doesn't matter if the food tastes good or not.. The service is the worst! Lazy and slow as ever!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and good service. I highly recommend if you are seeking good southern cooking."}
{"text":"This was our second visit and we weren't disappointed.  Had the fried whiting, mac and cheese, and yams. Those soul rolls (OMG), could have had a full meal of them. DELICIOUS.  Mozelle was the best. Beautiful and friendly. Will definitely be back next trip to Charlotte."}
{"text":"I liked the laid back homey feel of this place and their cornbread and BBQ sauce was really tasty.  However we never got our drinks, and when we did finally they were extremely warm glasses of wine and beer, none of us actually even finished them. Our server was not friendly and the food didn't wow us. Our table of 5 shared several sides, best were the mac and cheese and potato salad, their Cole slaw and black eyed peas we didn't get second helpings of. Reasonably priced and large portions so bang for your buck, but as an out-of-towner, if I came back would try somewhere else."}
{"text":"I was only in Charlotte for 3 days and I managed to eat here all 3 days. The best thing about this place is the sides. Collard greens, mac and cheese, mashed potatoes.. I could eat them forever. I still think about those collard greens...  The ribs and salmon cakes were alright, nothing to drool over.  Coconut cake-- super sweet and moist, really good but will probably induce diabetes"}
{"text":"Terrible service.....horrible service.  I ordered chicken and waffle.  I got a hot glass of wine, and my initial order was a 3/4 hard waffle then they brought me out a cold full waffle, the butter would not melt.  I wanted to like this place but I cant get past the HORRIBLE customer service."}
{"text":"O man, this place is amazing!  Ok ok, I'm not an expert in soul food or southern food, but if this is even close to what it is...uhhhh I AM A FANATIC.   Gotta try the beef ribs and fried catfish combo. The collard greens, okra, rice sides are not to be missed. Fried chicken was great! Cornbread that comes with the meals are not sweet but very very very buttery.   Only thing I would say was ehh was the salmon cake, that was a bit dry."}
{"text":"I finally got myself to Mert's for dinner the other night after reading all the great reviews. Unfortunately, I left unfulfilled.   The staff is nice, when you can actually get a hold of them. Be prepared to wait for everything. 10 minutes for someone to acknowledge us as we first walked in. Another 10 minutes for our server to greet us. Another 15 minutes for our food to show. Then another 10 minutes to get our check. This is just too slow for me.  The food was good. The cornbread held up to my high expectations; buttery with perfect texture. The BBQ pulled pork had a unique flavor. It is an intense, delicious flavor; but after the first few bites the intensity and vinegar becomes a bit overwhelming. My wife's fried chicken was also good.   Mert's would be a solid 4 star if the service was more attentive. It deserves another visit."}
{"text":"THE BEST soul food I've had in a long time. Being from Georgia i thought we had the best soul food and BOY was i wrong. I look forward to my next visit here. EVERYTHING was delicious and the customer service was excellent."}
{"text":"We LOVE Merts! What a great place to dine regularly & bring out of town guests. We've lived in Charlotte almost a year. Merts was the first place we dined in Charlotte & we continue to go back often & have taken almost all of our out of town guests. We just took my parents (from the Midwest) & they loved it, too. Great soul food and good service. Merts is always busy, but the food comes out quickly & is always tasty. The veg plates offer vegetarians or folks who just want to try a lot of sides a great dining option. Our guests have enjoyed the catfish, shrimp, ribs, fried chicken, & BBQ. And, the cornbread is to die for. Best cornbread I've ever had. We like that it always comes out hot & fresh & that you get real butter (instead of the packets most places serve today) to lather on your individual loaf. I can't say enough great things about Merts. Great place!"}
{"text":"Yum!! I was in town for a conference. A larger group of us went but my car load had gotten message late so we were arrived a good 20 min after our crew. They actually accommodated us as well as was possible, sitting us quickly and close to the other group. One of my colleagues was a little nervous about the authenticity of a soul food restaurant in the heart of downtown. Man. Oh. Man. Do not let the location fool you. Inside it is as down home as it gets.   The food was great. I had the catfish, yams and green beans. It was a bit salty for my taste but otherwise great! The loaf of cornbread came out first and I had to stop myself from eating it like it was the meal. It was perfect. Not too sweet and not too dry. My table mates had red beans and rice and some sides and the other one had a salad and some sides. I have no idea why he had a salad at a soul food place but he was the happiest of us all about the restaurant. Crazy! Ha. We compared Mert's to other soul food places and laughed at how people are so hard on soul food places.   The place was packed and the cool thing was the crowd was pretty diverse. I think you can tell a lot about a place by the crowd that eats there. This one seemed to appeal to everyone. So I would definitely go back. The service was kind of sketchy. She was fast and it was accurate we just had to ask for things that seemed standard - like refills & to go boxes. It was super busy though. All and all It's in the top 5 of soul food places I've been to across the country. The atmosphere and the music were also pretty fun. My only regret is that I didn't try the cobbler. Oh and if you're like me you will get enough food for 2 meals. Be prepared!"}
{"text":"First, let me start by saying I grew up on soul food, so my expectations for a soul food restaurant are high.  Unfortunately, Mert's is a failure to the soul food world.   They are located/attached to the Holiday Inn City Center, so I automatically assumed that the food and service would match the location, wrong! The service wasn't horrible, it was just slow.   The food on the other hand was horrible; the best thing I ate was the cornbread. The collard greens tasted like a mixture of vinegar, salt and lemon juice had been poured in the pot; I took one bite and realized that I was done with that portion of my meal. The cabbage was decent, but my cabbage looked moldy, yikes! The okra and tomatoes dish was meh; the okra was there, but the tomatoes were missing in action. The macaroni and cheese was old and dry. I am completely disappointed.  Will not return and I don't recommend you waste your money here. This place has an overall 3 star review for a reason."}
{"text":"I'm appalled that mert's has a 3.5 star rating on here. If you are looking for food-coma inducing, delicious soul food, this is your place. I usually go for the salmon cake meal with Mac and cheese and collards and I drool over the delicious cornbread they bring as an appetizer. Everything here is melt in your mouth indulgent and the atmosphere is so fun. Go for the strawberry cake if you manage to save room. You will not regret it. As a side note this place also has a pretty decent brunch."}
{"text":"First time i ate here. My wife and I sat outside on the terrace. The food was good. The 3 stars are for the following reasons: 1) as soon as our food was served, the waiter gave us the bill. He said he wasnt rushing us but who gives you the bill before even have taken 1 bite of your food. 2) when the waiter came to check up on us he saw i was paused eating my food. In other words i was taking my time. I even told him. He immediately insisted in bringing a box. Didnt even ask us if we wanted dessert. The cakes looked bomb but we didnt even get a chance to order it. 3) overall we felt very rushed. Our waiter was a cool guy but he really made us feel like we needed to eat quick and get the f out.   The whole giving us the bill right before even eating our food was weird. He did it to no one else who was sitting around us.   Anyways good food. Nice staff. But our waiter killed it by rushing us out of there."}
{"text":"Ooooh I'll tell ya! Southern done right! Had me some ribs and fried chicken with some Texas Peete hot sauce!! Oooooh weeee! Soul rolls are for real. Guy fieri ain't no liar. No he ain't."}
{"text":"Been a couple of times, salmon cakes and cornbread are my fav, they offer great veggie options.... but please please please put customer service ready cashiers on the phone to take peoples orders. I placed a lunch order and the woman I spoke to was very blunt and acted as if I was bothering her. I asked how long will my food take she said it would \"be ready when I arrived\" usually I get an estimate so it pretty much seemed as though she wanted to keep her answers short and abrupt. She also tried to over talk me when I asked the question and answer by interrupting me. It seems as though she did not want my business and I gave her what she wanted. I certainly did place an order at another restaurant. Please do better."}
{"text":"Food was on point and very delicious,  however our waitress was NOT the deal. He wasn't very friendly and added extra food to the order, repetitive of things that I did order causing me to have lots of the same things.  He didn't explain how orders came and often heard us call him only to pause and glance in our direction. We were NOT rude or anything of that nature. Greens could have been a lil better instead of like leaves but other than that,  I loved it. I won't let that one black monkey stop my show! !! I will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Go for the cornbread, stay for the mac and cheese and bbq pork.  The salmon cake has an interesting flavor, but the texture reminded me of crab cakes. I will stick with crab cakes in the future, but glad I tried something new.   If I ever make it back to Charlotte, I'd swing by again for the cornbread."}
{"text":"Eight of us went to Mert's today for lunch.  We started out our meal with fried green tomatoes and soul rolls.  The soul rolls were delicious.  I had the beef ribs with Mac and cheese and okra and tomatoes.  The ribs were good, but the sauce was sweeter than preferred.  The Mac and cheese was excellent and the okra was good.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their meals.  Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Our table agreed that the best part of this meal was the corn bread. Every order was lacking just that little something that would make a meal enjoyable. One person in our party of seven has said that he will return to give them another try.  The rest of us will not be back"}
{"text":"Bought a fried turkey for thanksgiving - thank goodness I had a back up!  Turkey was not cooked (raw inside). The gravy was really good though. What a waste!"}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying, I cook and cook well.  My family is from down south originally, and the family side from the midwest can cook.  So I'm biased when it comes to 'soul food' or 'southern food.'  Being in Charlotte from LA, my expectations aren't super high for soul food, seeing as though all we have is Roscoe's out there, which is average, but still the only 'go to' spot when you want soul food that you didn't prepare.   The girl at the register, was SUPER nice.  She answered my questions, and had some spunk and personality to her.  Call me weird, but bad attitudes and customer service don't go together.  So she was a pleasant surprise, especially considering 2 other ladies seemed to throw a couple dirty looks my way versus asking me if I had been helped.    Ended up ordering take out:  Got the fried chicken wings with 2 sides. Mac & cheese and collard greens.  Also ordered the salmon cakes appetizer (b/c of the raving yelp reviews) And the banana pudding.   Wings were just ok.  I'd give them 2.5 stars.  Not much flavor.  But if you don't know much about frying chicken, I could see how this place would be great for you to get your fix.   Salmon cakes: TERRIBLE.  The sauce that comes on the side was good, but they just didn't do it for me.  I took 3 bites and tossed them. 1 star.  Mac & Cheese: GREAT! 5 stars.  Should have just ordered a tub of that lol.   Greens: blah.  Too vinegary and bland.  I'm a greens snob.  So these were super below par for me.  1.5 stars  Banana pudding:  4 stars.  Pretty tasty.  Even though I just ate the bites where I could find some vanilla cookie and then once that was gone, tossed the rest.    Overall it was ok.  I'm going to try the other place later next week, called 'king's kitchen?' and see if they are any better."}
{"text":"Cheap, tasty, in the heart of Town.  A must try!  Bottomless mimosas on weekends are key to curing a long night!"}
{"text":"We went to Mert's based on the reviews on yelp and that it was one of the fav's listed in our travel guide.  And boy, I am so glad we did!    I'm not normally a fan of southern cooking, but the food is tasty but not cloyingly rich which I really appreciate.  The service is fast and friendly.  We wanted to try the cobbler based on the reviews and I wanted apple or blueberry but turns out they only have peach which was fine, it's a cornbread cobbler so the taste is a little salty, but really yummy.    Great find!  Thanks yelpers!"}
{"text":"We loved the ribs and fried chicken! The Mac n cheese and mashed potatoes were awesome. Husband loved the green beans. Good service too!"}
{"text":"Great food great staff never again kings kithen! Jim nobles close shop! Thank you guys a great place great food!"}
{"text":"I couldn't even eat what I wanted on the menu because their sanitation grade is low..... this 90 includes the 2 bonus points they received for attending the ServSafe class.. the staff was friendly but the workers continued to chat with each other when they could have been working."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for a meal recently, and by god...it was delicious! Everything about it - from the cornbread to the bbq ribs, everything was decadent but not extremely heavy. We ordered their famous salmon cakes, their ribs platter, with mac and cheese sides, homefries, collard greens, and their okra and tomato stew.  The mac and cheese and collard greens were average (at least in my opinion since I didn't grow up eating soul food I probably can't say too much about the taste of these two items), but the stars of the meal were the cornbread (this was by far the best cornbread I have ever tasted in my life....getting sweeter with every bite), the ribs (in this tangy sweet bbq sauce that you just want to dip everything into it), and the salmon cakes (these tasted confusing at first but gradually the unmistakable salmon flavor seeps through - truly umami in your mouth).  The salmon cakes really surprised me. I expected fried fish patties, at the very least dripping with oil or grease, but instead got these lovely, grilled tasty salmon cakes that were absolutely amazing but weren't heavy at all (the fattening feeling you get after eating fried foods).   Bottom line, go for anything with sides and cornbread to try as much of their menu as possible. And believe this place is the real thing (big quantities and good quality...and affordable!)- the inside makes you feel like you're in the old South and they've got dim lighting that makes this place glow warmly from the inside. Also, it helps that Hillary Clinton chose to eat at this place for lunch two days ago on her visit to Charlotte. There ya go."}
{"text":"Here visiting for Father's Day and wow!   Good low country soul food.   Enough to make this Texas not very happy.   Seated promptly and ordered the salmon cakes.   Homemade corn bread to start doesn't get any better, it is perfect.   A little sweet and taste like crazy corn bread should. You need to stop either for a meal or a little nosh when visiting Charlotte."}
{"text":"Always friendly, the staff here will usually go out of their way to make sure you have a great meal. Everything I've tried is great, but special note goes to the cornbread and the catfish. The collard greens are also great, slightly tangy and with a good feel, not overcooked. This is soul food without going overboard on salt and fat. Of course, they are there, just not as much as some soul food places.  I wish they had pie."}
{"text":"The cornbread was the best part of the meal, all the other menu items I tried was sub-par."}
{"text":"Soul food is tricky for me, being southern I have a steady diet of \"soul food.\" The tricky part comes in bc the actual food doesn't deliver. I like to try foods I don't normally make myself, so I avoid the usual staples like collards, beans, and mac & cheese. I tried the beef ribs, yams, and black eyed peas. I should have ordered the staples. The yams were the best part, just sweet enough. The peas were oddly sweet also...yuck. Salty, yes. Hammy, word. Sweet, gross. The beef ribs were a joke the serving was one and a half pieces and six bones. Of course I rolled my eyes and muttered to myself but since I was with company I kept quiet. As with most soul food places,  I think this place caters to folks that don't have a momma that can throw down."}
{"text":"While visiting Charlotte from Birmingham, AL, we stopped by Mert's for lunch. We absolutley LOVED it. Our waitress was amazing and the food was even better. By far the best cornbread I have ever had in my life. When ever I come to Charlotte I'll always eat here. I had the Salmon cakes which are made with fresh salmon and I loved how spicy the collard greens were. Thanks for such a wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"Good hearty food with fast and friendly service. I had a BBQ omelet with grits and homemade biscuits, the biscuits were so good!"}
{"text":"Go to Mert's if you want good southern comfort food!  their cornbread is great and they always have lots of cakes and pies for dessert options.  This place is a Charlotte tradition and if you are visiting town - plan a have at least 1 meal here."}
{"text":"Around 2pm, I decided I needed to eat and found this place based on a nearby shopkeepers recommendation. As soon as I walked in the door I was greeted and shown a seat. The decor was fun and made it feel southern. This is the first time I have had Southern food, so I may not be as discriminating as some with more experience.   With that being said, I ordered lemonade and water to drink. My waitress brought delicious cornbread before my meal. For food I ordered the BBQ chicken, yams and collard greens. Their greens come with a tomato and onions but since I told the waitress I had never had them before she said they are good by themselves and maybe I should try them that way.  The food didn't take long to arrive and the portions were decent. Not huge, but since I'm not a big eater, it was perfect. The flavor was good for all the items.   The food was reasonably priced and food. I would recommend it and go here again."}
{"text":"The fried catfish was perfect.  The sides were good too.  the service was good and the people friendly.  Good place."}
{"text":"It's been several years since I've been to Mert's, and I have to say I was a little let down.  Now don't get me wrong the food is still good, although not consistent from dish to dish.  The cornbread is on point, buttered to die for.  The Salmon cakes were not very well seasoned, the collards on the tasteless side. The Mac and cheese was creamy and delish.    The service is still terrific, the staff friendly and very attentive. They greeted me like they just saw me yesterday, with that \"come in and set a spell\", Southern charm.    While my meal was not great, I would go again for the \"Tiger Wood\" (sweet iced tea/lemonade), and to try something different on the menu,"}
{"text":"Always looking to try local owned and Mert's was great. We came for early lunch right when they opened on a Monday. Everyone raves about the cornbread and it was amazing but my favorite is the salmon cakes and the red beans and rice with turkey sausage. The atmosphere is casual and comfortable. If you are uptight and concerned about wanting to be catered to in a formal setting, this isn't it. However, the service is friendly and prompt. Park behind the Holiday Inn in the garage and Mert's with validate."}
{"text":"Second time to dine at Mert's.  It's Thursday night and the wait for takeout was just as long for a table.  The advantage of being on the road and dining for one did mean I got seated much quicker than the people on the wait list.  This time I ordered the salmon cake with yam and slaw, which Yelpers were highly recommending.  The sweet yam was like a dessert in itself - and I love candied yam so that was big tick for me.  The slaw was finely chopped and creamy, also lived up to expectation.  The Salmon cake tho - slightly under salted.  Seeing that this is poached salmon with added flavoring after, I think maybe some of the salmon flavor got lost along the way.  Overall still tasty and solid but I would say their other items such as fried chicken and ribs were more to my liking.  Service was also  little chaotic - it was packed.  The waitress brought me my food with my cutlery, and then my ice tea never came (I forgot about it too but never saw my waitress coming by and too hungry to wait).  And when I asked to get it to go, I ended up with sweetened tea instead of unsweetened.  Oh well."}
{"text":"Real stuff, all good, all tasty. Helpful, attentive  staff. Sixties and seventies Motown music.  Food: Good, authentic, clean, tasty.  Decor: Cool Southern folk art and celebrity photos  Service: Fun, informative, and friendly."}
{"text":"First...absolutely the best service I've had ever. We tipped her 50%. She was that good. The biscuits are better than Flying Biscuit's. Salmon cakes were flavorful. Veggies were perfectly flavored. Good experience all around."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place that has some decent soul food with OK service at moderate prices, then Mert's is the place for you.  This place did not knock my socks off.  The food was ok.  It wasn't the most amazing seasoning, but everything was cooked correctly.  The corn muffins were huge and came out hot, but didn't have that gritty corn texture that I hate about corn muffins.  I don't know what they do to those tasty treats, but it beats bringing out a bread basked any day.  The downside was that they did not have any of the \"specials\" listed on the chalk board above the kitchen.  Mert's...you can't put broccoli & cheese up there and expect me to be like \"oh yeah, I didn't want that anyway even though it's been staring me in the face for the last 15 minutes.\"  The server was really nice. I'm also not sure if the Manager was also helping out, but he was certainly on the floor taking care of business.  The decor seemed like a bit of a mish mosh.  It wasn't a dirty place, but it definitely seemed a bit outdated and pieced together.  I don't know if I'll be back, but if I have a friend in uptown looking for some comfort food, I'll send them over to Mert's."}
{"text":"My co worker had recommended this place to me months ago, but since I had been greatly underwhelmed by just about all of the so-called 'Soul Food' restaurants that I have visited ever since I moved down South, I quickly forgot about her recommendation. The other night, while I was watching Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives, I was pleasantly surprised when they put a spotlight on Merts. I had to go give it a try. Long story short, phenomenal Soul Food that's greatest strength is how simple and yet flavorful it is! The Beef Ribs were wonderful, very meaty and moist; the Salmon Cakes were savory and delicious with or without the included remoulade; the Macaroni and Cheese is thick, rich and hearkens back to a time when people put time and care into what they did; the Seasoned Rice is perfectly cooked and very flavorful; and the Soul Rolls will leave you wishing that the portion was MUCH bigger because they're so good. Oh yeah, did I forget to mention that this food was this awesome and I ordered Take-out? All in all, as good as advertised and they greatly exceeded my expectations. I definitely WILL be back."}
{"text":"Omg!!!!! The best salmon patties I've ever had (sorry momma) lol....my fiancé and I had the 4 way veggie platter.... the mac and cheese..seasoned rice....yams....cornbread and potatoe salad (we both had a mixture) was great!!!! I felt like I was back at my grandmas...the service was good and the staff was very friendly....I would for sure go back!!!"}
{"text":"Great comfort food!  Really cool find downtown near the train, museums, etc.  Love it!"}
{"text":"Food is great. Service staff needs serious upgrading. Upselling, explanation of daily specials, and just common hospitality is lacking. Manager is young yet vibrant and willing to go the extra mile. I give this place three stars due to poor service but if that improves I would easily rate this spot 4.5"}
{"text":"Omg best service and food ever!! We tried the beef ribs and fried chicken, most juicy food ever! Hands down the best cornbread ever :) this California boy is digging NC soul food haha"}
{"text":"This is one of the places that you have to go to if you are in Charlotte.  It is local and very unique and you will not find anything like it anywhere else.    The food is interesting and the atmosphere is very unique.  I have been there many times and have never been disspointed."}
{"text":"First time in Charlotte, great food. Started with the soul rolls, then went with the red beans & rice with Turkey Sausage, side of home made corn bread & grits. Had a beer. Went with a half slice of sweet potato cake, everything was $25. Service was great also."}
{"text":"Being from the south all of my life, I know great food. This was just okay to me. The fried chicken disappointed me a little. It wasn't as tasteful as I expected. BUT the cornbread tastes just like my grandma's (which is heavenly) and the Mac & cheese is pretty great. My boyfriend got fried chicken tenders which were more flavorful than the fried chicken wings. The soul roll appetizers were tasty too. Although service was quick, our server was also a bit on the attitude-y side. She answered questions snarkly, talked to us while walking away, and barely responded to questions to make sure she heard me. She then made a comment about her tip which would have been more if she had not had such an unfit mood. I'd definitely go back but only in the hopes of a more pleasant server!"}
{"text":"I heard so many beautiful things about there tasty oxtails. On a Saturday summer night, they had no more oxtails  after placing my order and I was disappointed... no business should be out of their favorite dishes by the patrons.  I hope then I go back they will have oxtails."}
{"text":"Mert's is a great find in downtown Charlotte.  The service is solid and the food is pretty good.  They have a beer and wine menu, but seem surprised when you order and adult beverage.  I took my servers suggestion and ordered beef ribs and fried fish.  It arrived along with sides of macaroni and cheese and black eyed peas.  The black eyes were some of the best I have ever had.  The beef ribs were really short ribs and were gristly and disappointing.  My husband opted for the special \"Tia's Chicken\" - chicken breaded with Parmesan and Italian seasoning topped with cream sauce.  This along with green beans and sweet potatoes made for a solid meal.  The chicken was good and a huge portion.  If back in Charlotte, we would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"I come from Harlem so my take on what southern/soul food should be is probably a bit skewed but one thing I can differentiate between is f'n bad food and f'n good food.  Mert's is definitely good.   The service was kind, warm and attentive even though it was a bit busy in there.  I ordered the Shrimp Creole dish and by no means was I disappointed. It was saucy plus spicy (those traits can't be wrong in women nor food), small shrimp goodness ladled on top of rice.  The cornbread comes before your meal and good thing I don't judge on the free food.  Just sayin'.  One thing to write home about is the COLLARD GREENS! I could eat a lasagna dish full of just their greens.  It's slightly bitter, balanced out with butter and a slight citrus taste and perfectly cooked.  You must try it!  My only complaint is the cleanliness, the place needs a little TLC especially in the corners that people (unlike me) don't typically look, or don't want to anyway. Give it a rub down.  All and all, 2 contently hard nipples for Mert's."}
{"text":"Was down in Charlotte this past weekend looking for a place to eat and we walk past this restaurant so we decide to go and grab some food. We have some soul food restaurants in Philadelphia but this is by far is the best I've ever been to. The collar greens were cook perfect and the mac & cheese was amazing. When I go back to Charlotte I'll definitely be making this a must stop.  Can you guys open a restaurant in Philadelphia please..."}
{"text":"Portions are huge (any plate can feed two and I am a big man), food taste is okay, wait is too long. Well, basically that's what it is, nothing much else to say.  Restaurant is small, therefore if you want a table and don't want to wait too long come early!"}
{"text":"My wife and I moved to Charlotte from Jersey not too long ago. When people come to visit, this is the only place we HAVE TO take them. Definitely our go-to soul food spot in the area, hands down! As a matter of fact, we're going to go again tomorrow!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I celebrated our wedding night here. I ordered the whiting, string beans and Mac and cheese. The portions were more than enough. Everything was cooked and seasoned just right. They only have wine and beer there. Please don't look at the chalkboard by the kitchen, that menu is incorrect. I'll definitely order that dish again."}
{"text":"So happy I chose this place for lunch during my day in Charlotte. Fun atmosphere and great food!"}
{"text":"Mert's is without a doubt a landmark and plays a role in the historic fabric of charlotte. My recent visit though was not to impressive. The food was decent, although the home fries were raw. Maybe the cook was having a bad day and is off his/her game. I would give this place a try again."}
{"text":"When we first moved to Charlotte, NC from Savannah, I was really looking forward to trying Southern food here. A lot of people suggested Mert's. One word-YUCK! We ordered simple items. Fried chicken, macaroni and cheese and collards. The chicken was tasteless and the mac was bland. The service wasn't great either. She leaned over our table,with her butt in the other patrons face the entire time. Not impressed. I went a second time just in case they were having a bad day. I ordered catfish with okra and tomatoes. Again-YUCK! The catfish was fried too hard and did not have any meat on it. The okra and tomatoes were alright. Still searching for a great southern restaurant."}
{"text":"Service was friendly and down home flavored. Catfish, black eye peas and cabbage was well seasoned.. I also recommend the shrimp Creole. ..lots of green onions. I do not recommend the peach cobbler. That was like eating peach filling on bread."}
{"text":"Overall, this was a good dining experience.  Six of us went for lunch. The service was a little on the slow side but that was understandable considering that it was lunch time. I had whiting, Mac and cheese and collards.  The collards were just ok......not seasoned very well.  The others in my party enjoyed their meal as well."}
{"text":"I wish I could say it was worth the 20-25 min wait, but no. The hostess was quite rude. She sat a group of 4 that came in after my group of 3 and when I asked about it, she said \"It's complicated\". Seemed simple enough to me. So after waiting patiently, we were then asked to wait \" outside\". She didn't ask any of the people that came after us, but saw fit to approach the next ones to be seated. At that point I was ready to walk out, but I was with my parents celebrating their 51st wedding anniversary...I didn't want to ruin their night. The food was alright, I've had better."}
{"text":"We ate here during our visit to the Queen City, service and food were amazing. The prices were great, I would recommend everything. At our table we had salmon cakes, mac n cheese, fried chicken and fish, collard greens, cabbage, bbq pork, several desserts and last but not least cornbread. If you get an opportunity stop in and enjoy !"}
{"text":"It's been many years since I lasted visited Mert's and although I enjoyed my meal, it seems like something was missing. I ordered whiting, collard greens, yams and it came with a side of cornbread. The yams were runny and the fish tasted just ok. The collards and cornbread were fantastic! I also sampled my dates' mac n' cheese and it tasted just like someone's grandmother made it."}
{"text":"This spot is located downtown charlotte so in a prime location. It was recommended for charlottes black restaurant week. I was super excited to try something new and have some great soul food. Came in no special restaurant week menu I'm use to but rolled with it. The hostess noted 25 percent off combos for the week. We were immediately seated. The table had a large 6 pack sauce holder on the table. Moved it off it took up too much space. Waitress was nice but she wasn't aware of the specials. My friend and I got the catfish with chicken combo. It seemed like a lot of food so we decided to share. It was a decent portion to share if your not famished. The cat fish was salty, the cabbage was bland, the chicken was burnt, and the Mac and cheese was decent. Got a side of red beans which was maybe from the bottom of the pot. They charge extra for corn bread. The price wasn't stated when we placed the order we were asked if we wanted 2 pieces. The corn bread was good. The place had items on the counter that were irrelevant and collecting dust.  So this is soul food in the south...."}
{"text":"The Sanitation Score is 90.  The black eyed peas had crunchy grit (like from dirt or sand) The fried chicken was devoid of taste.  I had to pay $3 for parking to just run in and get my to go meal. (Don't bother \"validating\" the parking card at the restaurant, the cost is still $3) This place is going downhill."}
{"text":"Well smack the dentures right out of your southern grandma's mouth! Just like a old time Sunday dinner in the Deep South! As your ears are filled with music of the soul, R&B, and blues varieties; once your server sets the plate of cornbread loafs on your table, you know you're in for a treat! Yes, cornbread loafs that are sweet and when smothered with the accompanying butter, absolutely delicious! We ordered the salmon patties with Mac n Cheese and green beans! This is not salmon from a can, instead fresh poached salmon that are extremely tasty! The Mac n Cheese was probably baked before serving, and without question the best I've had at a restaurant! The green beans were cooked, no doubt, in some kind of bacon grease presumably. We also had a combination plate of the bbq beef ribs with a fried chicken breast! I'm not a fan of beef ribs, but these were tender and not overpowered by the bbq sauce! The fried chicken was, well, southern fried chicken at its finest! We also tried the candied yams which were cooked perfectly without being too sweet from the brown sugar. The place makes you feel as though your in a diner in Harlem; with the decor and old time soul music blending with the aromas of fresh southern roots! The servers could be a little more attentive, however our redeemed himself after seeing us stop another waitress to ask for refills. I will say that each employee was personable, hospitable, and eager when asked to give you their take on the food and history of this popular spot in downtown Charlotte. As I paid and walked out the door,  passing a street performer doing her best Etta James impersonation, I realized that outside of Harlem you just don't find many places like Mert's! Starting another diet, this Southern Gentleman just had a great meal!"}
{"text":"What can I say? It was hands down delicious. I ordered the combo meal of chopped bbq and 2 sides ofmac and cheese and collards. Portions were generous and the flavor was delicious! Service was great our waiter was prompt and had a great attitude. Will look forward to returning if I'm in the area again!"}
{"text":"This place reminds me of the diners in New Orleans. Cozy and welcoming with simple food done exceptionally well.   I had the red beans and rice with turkey kielbasa. The portion size was perfect; though if there had been more on my plate, I would have kept on eating. This is the kind of meal that fills you up and warms you from the inside.   My only complaint is the small amount of options for gluten free diners such as myself, though that's relatively common among soul food restaurants. Any chance we can get some GF cornbread? The little loafs are so charming!"}
{"text":"Pretty Good Comfort Food For The Soul. I had the beef rib and chicken breast with a side of red beans and collard greens. The staff was nice and I really appreciated the nostalgic images on the wall of historic performers and movie creative."}
{"text":"I bought a Livingsocial deal for Mert's. The place is crowed for brunch on Sat. We were quickly seated. The cornbreads were very delicious and warm. Don't take the cornbread to go because it isn't that good when it is a take out.  I got the salmon cake with two sides mac and cheese and mash potatoe with gravy. The side orders were good sizes. They weren't stingy on the gravy enough for your mash potatoe. My dad had the catfish and the beef ribs. The beef ribs were good but catfish was more on the fishy side. Overall, we enjoyed Mert's. The staffs were all very friendly.The quarter leg was also good. The nice young lady who waited on us was fast and nice. It was a busy day and she even remembered to refill my drink. If you work at downtown, give Mert's a try."}
{"text":"I love Merts! Not too greasy, not too salty, just right.  This place is better for small parties, not big ones.  I've been with both, the food is still good, but you will have a better experience. Everything is good, go as frequently as you can to try it all lol."}
{"text":"On a short layover in Charlotte, we wanted to have a taste of the town since we'd never been here before.  My better half was really craving fried chicken, and we wanted something well-rated, non-chain, and definitely local.  Enter Mert's.  It's located among the Queen City's tallest downtown skyscrapers, which really impressed the kids as we walked a couple blocks from affordable parking.  Yup, you read right - no on-site parking, short of what's available on the street, when it's allowed.  The place is jam-stuffed with character by way of miscellaneous framed pictures, signs, old Americana, and even hanging bicycles.  The wall even has an interesting blended/faded paint job on it - really nice!  We were promptly ushered to a table, provided menus and drinks, and kindly assisted with a tour of the menu and food options after we introduced ourselves as Charlotte and Mert's first-timers.  I ordered a fried chicken leg quarter with sides of collard greens and yams.  My bride went with salmon cakes, and sides of mac & cheese and mashed potatoes.  Kid #1 had chicken fingers, and #2 had grilled cheese.  Before dinner arrived, we were served two plates with two large servings of cornbread each.  The bread was steaming hot, and hit the bullseye on very straight-forward cornbread.  Tasty!  Dinner arrived and, as we always do, wifey and I partook family-style, trading bites of everything between us.  Overall, everything was good at worst, and a couple items were amazing!  Unfortunately, in our opinion, the fried chicken fell into the former category.  Don't get me wrong - it was tasty, the meat was moist, the skin crispy.  It's just that it seemed to lack seasoning - even basic salt and/or pepper.  And, admittedly, my expectation for chicken joints is that the chicken be outstanding and a bit different.  Not just well-executed plain fried chicken.    However, the salmon cakes and all the sides were fantastic.  This was only the second time I've had collard greens, and Mert's were the better of the two I've had.  Not only that, but I'd say it was the best thing I tasted on this occasion!  Also really, really good were the yams and the salmon cakes.  Service was better than average, and very friendly.  Also, all four of us left stuffed like turkeys on the big day, and for a very reasonable cost.  Great value.  Charlotte did right by us for our first taste of her riches!  We hope to return again soon!  Food = 4/5  Facility = 3/5 Service = 4/5 Ambiance = 4/5 Value = 4/5"}
{"text":"Seriously... this place is pretty wonderful!  I love the taste of the food, the service is excellent, and love the decor.  It reminds me of small places in Harlem.  The food is super delicious and the sizes are just right... filling if you are super hungry and choices for the not so hungry folks.  The prices are very reasonable, and frankly you cannot beat that in the Uptown Charlotte area.  Why not the fifth star?  Well because I feel that it's missing calillou, and island drinks, like sorrell.  If they made things like that, then it would be a perfect 5 stars.  I would love to see fried okras on the menu as well.  Even with all of these things that they do not have... they do have some super yummy things... Try their Sweet Potatoe Souffle!  Oh my goodness that is freakin' awesome!!!  It's like... sweet veggies and dessert all at the same time!  Super awesome!    Care for some soul food?  Definitely go to Mert's!"}
{"text":"Living downtown for over 6 years my family and friends have dined here very often. The food is good, prices very reasonable. I consciously support local businesses. Last night my husband and I decided to call in an order at 8:40 we were told 15 min we didn't arrive to pick up food until 9:00pm. I walked in and stood at front desk for at least 10 min BEFORE ANYONE ACKNOWLEDGED I saw waitress hurrying pass helping customers etc.I waited eventually a server in a purple shirt not sure if different colors represent positions comes over I tell her the name she looks around goes and gets my food from kitchen I check bag everything was there she takes bag back places on table behind cash register then walks away . I'm standing there confused another server notices me comes over ask do I need any help and I'm like yes I want to check out and for the inconvenience of me standing for now 15 min for a slice of cake he obliged as he returned with A SLICE of cake purple shirt hurries says\"what you think your doing ,he says some words pretty low she Snatches cake and says did you ask kiona. I'm like umm is kiona manager. purple shirt leaves now I'm livid, embarrassed still hungry etc.A server comes over in red shirt ask how can she help I explain I've been standing here for 20 min I called in my order over 35 min ago she Goes through my bag  again. Now I'm feeling upset why is everyone checking the food .She says the reason it took so long is because A MANAGER TOOK MY PHONE ORDER AND ONLY SHE CAN CHECK ME OUT AND SHE IS BUSY WHAT are you serious but she has PERMISSION to do so now. I couldn't understand the protocol. Why answer phone .This was upsurd. I said can you ask the manager for a slice of cake. NOT FREE DINNERS she comes back and says mysterious manager said NO if she gave me a slice everyone would need one .As a business owner I understand that my clients need to feel heard, appreciated and respected a $4 slice WAS THIS SERIOUS .MY husband came in because it was now close yup 30 min of me walking into the place. He also owns a business in Charlotte and has brought many clients to Merts he told me he no longer wanted to pay for the meal that we will patronage another business in which we did and called in , food was ready, we were greeted with respect. THANKS \"Dish\". If Merts can't handle busy hours, understaffed etc.IT IS NEVER THE CUSTOMERS RESPONSIBILTY. Disappointed that I can no longer support a rude establishment. My time and money are valuable and not to be treated any differently. The young guy with light braids should be a manager he knows how to calmly find solutions however he didn't have control over this situation and neither did I."}
{"text":"Had high hopes but was a bit disappointed. Greens did not seem cooked (were tough) and did not have good flavor (ended up sending them back after one bite). The macaroni didn't taste \"homemade either\" tasted like boxed macaroni with cheese placed on top and then baked and even that was baked too hard. The shrimp Po Boy was pretty good, shrimp was seasoned well and not over cooked... bread was good but could've been softer. Highlight was the lemon cake!!! If I returned I'd stick to the sandwich and cake and skip the sides."}
{"text":"First time here. Salmon cakes were good, I had too high expectations they would taste like mom's."}
{"text":"Great fried chicken! love their fresh, fully veg collard greens! the mac and cheese is the good ol' Southern country style. Always fresh, always fast. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Leave it to my Yelp family to send me to the best spots when I'm traveling. I came to Charlotte for a conference and decided to check Mert's out with a bunch of my colleagues. In short, we loved it!  Cornbread: I've never been a huge cornbread fan, but this cornbread had me wanting more and more! It was soooooooo hot and delicious!  Jumbo wings: You get three with the meal. Fried perfectly. Delicious. Delicious. Delicious.  Mac & Cheese: I can't seem to find decent mac & cheese out west so I wait until I come back East to get my fix. This mac & cheese was all things perfect! Two thumbs up.  Collard greens: This was my least favorite dish. While I appreciated that they weren't overlooked, they were really vinegary. I wasn't a fan.  Sweet potato cake: I had never heard of such a delicacy. I figured since I love sweet potatoes and I'm a fan of cake, this would hit the spot! I think it needed more butter though as it was really dry.  Overall, a must visit place when you're in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"It's OK.  It's soul food.  The fried chicken was straight forward.  Not likely to go back for just that, as Price's is much better in my opinion.    I was also able to sample the BBQ pork... It was a tad weird.  My girlfriend accurately pointed out it tasted like curry.   I would steer clear of that.   The mac and cheese was good because, let's be honest, it's cheese and cheese is good.  The collards were authentic and would get them again.    Our server was very nice and attentive.    Overall rating - Just an OK."}
{"text":"Great price, great food and great service. I had the Jumbo wing dinner that was accompanied by (slap yo momma) mac n cheese and collard greens. I wasn't particularly thrilled about the collard greens but they were played nicely and taste fresh. I will be back again!!!"}
{"text":"Giving Merts 2 stars for their BRUNCH only. I recently visited Mert's for a brunch date and was so excited. I ordered the French toast with the western omelette and home fries. The French toast was okay but the omelette is another story. Their white cheddar cheese had absolutely no flavor and neither did anything on the omelette. My date ordered fish and grits (the fish was okay) but since the water Merts uses tastes bitter, so did the grits. I hope they get a filter for their water as it is disgusting.   When I mentioned it to the waitress, she added that she's heard the complaint before. LOL It's really difficult to mess up a breakfast and I am so sorry to say Mert's did. I wouldn't recommend them for brunch but for lunch and dinner, it's okay. I recommend ordered a soda as the water definitely has issues."}
{"text":"ordered the carolina chopped bbq and wasn't very impressed. i felt bad having brought my parents to this place and was expecting a lot more. :-("}
{"text":"We chose to visit Mert's over going to a high-end chain because we wanted southern style cuisine, it was featured in travel guide from our hotel, and it got great reviews on Yelp.  I was in town earlier this month with my Mom and toddler while we visited my youngest brother who was working in nearby Kannapolis.  We were able to sit down right away and outdoors which was great.  However, we were highly disappointed by the food.  And, the experience is still memorable enough for me to write about now.  First, they were out of the fried green tomatoes which we wanted to try and we were actually there relatively early to when they opened.  The eggroll-style appetizer that was recommended instead was good but definitely within the same criteria of what we were looking for.  99% of the menu has fried food which my brother was most disappointed about since we chose the restaurant without too much input on his part.  My Mom and I decided to share the Mert's Famous Salmon Cakes.  While the size was decent, the taste was lacking and I felt it might be slightly under-cooked.  For our sides, we chose greens and the red beans both of which were just ok.  And, I will actually say the greens were my favorite food out of what I had if forced to choose.  My brother ordered the Shrimp Creole which just tasted like tomatoes and the shrimp was not popcorn style as described on the menu.  If it had tasted better I think my brother could have been happy that he found something not fried on the menu even though he had decided if he was going to make a diet exception that he was looking forward to it being popcorn shrimp.  After our waitress checked on us she said as a person from New Orleans had we asked her she would have told us that the Shrimp Creole is not on her recommendation list.  However, because other customers have enjoyed it she does not deter people form ordering it...tough position to be in I guess.  My brother also ordered the potato salad which was very heavy on the mustard and vinegar.  I'm accustomed to this style of potato salad but like I said it just had too much mustard for my liking.  My daughter had the chicken tenders from the kids menu which I found to be on the salty side but she seemed to enjoy them.  She also liked the okra and tomato and yams sides that we ordered for her.  The server was nice and she took decent care of us.  She forgot more coffee like my Mom requested but we also noticed that she seemed to have several tables.    Overall I would say I'm not likely to give it another chance just because it seemed like we were in an area with a lot of choices which might have been a lot better.  I don't know if the chef was having off day or what but I just left very disappointed and felt bad that I was the primary person pushing to try Mert's during our brief trip to Charlotte."}
{"text":"Can you say SOUL FOOD! Wow this place is incredible. Smack downtown, food made with southern love.  This comfort food heaven...."}
{"text":"Found this place through yelp because we were looking for southern comfort food and because we were stopping over in Charlotte for the day. Great place!! The food was excellent, every single member of our family agreed that we had a five star meal. Portions are very significant, and the pricing is good. Really wonderful service - friendly and down to earth server. Overall a great meal experience!"}
{"text":"Coming to Mert's is very hit or miss. Since moving to NC, I've been a handful of times, but the taste and service just aren't consistent.   The service:  I'm always greeted by a friendly hostess and immediately seated. Usually, I have very nice and attentive servers, except the last two times, especially the last time I had gone. The waitress just acted like she didn't want to be there and like we were intruding on her job, which ironically, is to serve customers.  The ambiance: I like it. It's like a colorful hodge-podge of historical knick-knacks. The only thing I don't like is the stickiness of the tables.  The price: This place is VERY affordable. For example, a chicken wing meal with two sides is about $10. A huge slice of cake is like $4. Nothing is outrageously priced.  The food: It was very good the first time I had gone. The second time, it was still pretty good. However, the last two times were an utter fail. During my last visit, I had to return my food because a hair was in it. I declined another meal because my appetite was lost because my food was disgusting and I found a hair.  I've tried a couple of things on the menu. The fried chicken wings were pretty good the first time, but after that, they lacked seasoning, so i had to use hot sauce, which i usually don't do. The macaroni & cheese is good. I hated the candied yams; they clearly come from a can and are really soft, mushy, & overcooked. The greens aren't the best but aren't the worst. To me, they have a bit much of a vinegary taste to them. The cornbread is good. Their Sweet Potato Cake is delicious! I love it!  But, sometimes it's sold out, so that saddens me when it happens, lol! I've tried the beef ribs, and I really don't like them, but they're not flat out nasty. I would much rather eat ribs from a smokehouse or another BBQ place. My last time I decided to try the fried shrimp po'boy with a side of home fries. It was DISGUSTING. The shrimp were very, very tiny, even for popcorn shrimp, and EXTREMELY greasy. The fried batter was soggy and falling off of the shrimp.The home fries were cold and lacked seasoning. I sent that plate back.   So, I hope you catch them on a good day!"}
{"text":"My Co worker and I went to the Mert Soul Food today. We go different places Uptown Charlotte for lunch. I was like here we go again. So we come in , place an order to go no one said have a seat while you wait nothing. Mind you we placed an order for 2 jumbo wing plates. There was not a smile between 4 grown ass, you would think professional server/ waitresses or what ever they are considered to be. I would have sworn they were races against there own race but, one was Caucasian. So, upon receiving our order I asked for hot sauce. The female who brought us our order where we were seated outside, rudely told me it's in the bag. So we checked our bags there were 2 packets of hot sauce for each 3 piece (JUMBO) wing meal. I stepped inside and said in a joking manner now you  know I need some more hot sauce smiling the entire time. Her: No, I didn't know but, I'll get you some more. With the nastiest disposition possible. That thing bothered me like an experience I just had at Taste of Charlotte. So, I called for I guess an hour or more. Finally someone answered the phone. I asked for the manager. Bet you can't guess who the manager was. LMAO. I inquired about how dry and nasty and cold and unfriendly there establishment was. Because, this wasn't the first time. Not to mention not one smile from entering to leaving. This damn girl said, \"I gave you standard what we issue for an order. I said, \"you're missing the point, your staff didn't smile or say a friendly word.\" She said, I smiled when I said have a nice day.\" So I guess that was shade. I told her that I would make sure to leave them a review so here's the sun light to your shade. A large party of law enforcement came in and they were all lit. So, I guess maybe dine in customers that are potential tippers get smiles and local employees get the sour face. So, I will keep posting. Customers, potential customers, dine in, dine out, whatever the case may be,  deserve hospitality and service with a smile. Word of mouth is your best advertisement. Ratcheted...ness has no place in Public Relations. Customers matter and keeps your business growing and going."}
{"text":"We arrived a half hour before closing and that was prob our mistake! They had ran out of many menu options - we finally settled on the fried chicken dinner with black eyed peas greens and cornbread- the peas were ice cold they said it would be a while to replace (code for we don't have anymore) so we chose beans - they lukewarm and NOT good - the chicken was hot at one time but not when served to us and skimpy- service was mediocre at best - hugely disappointing since the first time we dined there a year earlier on our way to Charleston SC it was fabulous this last visit did not live up to the hype from our last visit and overpriced for the portions you get"}
{"text":"After our edifying visit to the Bechtler, we needed some practical, real sustenance. From the man's memories of the dark days of living and working in Charlotte, he unearthed this gem, and what a bright one it was!  I was a little skeptical of his years-old memory of this as great soul food, especially given his vegetarian status at the time. (I mean, hello lard!) But I've learned to trust, and was well-rewarded on this visit. Mert's is a bit tucked away, and doesn't look like much from the sidewalk or even as you step inside.   But, for soul food, that's a good thing. A good thing that just kept getting better.  Now, I spent some time living in the South as well, and that's where I developed a taste for two of the simplest and best culinary pleasures: greens and beans. And Mert's served up some of the absolute best collards I've ever had: thick and silky, folded on themselves in a heaping mound on the plate, so slightly redolent of a little bacon and sprinkled with lithe ribbony onions. Oh. My. God. I hope I live long enough to learn how to make collards like these....  In other news, the cornbread was phenomenal: dense without being heavy, moist without being crumbly, and actually tasting of cornmeal and buttermilk instead of sugar. My black-eyed peas were savory and straightforward, and the barbecue (while not my absolute favorite Eastern Carolina style) was dripping in a just-sweet red vinegar sauce. Oh, and the red velvet cake was excellent: moist with a ever-so-tangy icing. Did you think I was going to pass that up, once I saw it in its tall cake platter on the counter?!  This is why the term \"foodie\" fails as a designator for people such as myself who avidly seek out the best, most authentic food experiences one can find. There's nothing elite about Mert's, but they prove how difficult it can be to pull off simple perfection."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! The Soul Rolls get 10 stars! I ordered quite a bit and it was all full of flavor. My order was take out, as usual, and I have to mention that the way they package everything is the BEST I HAVE EVER ENCOUNTERED on my food quest. The dishes are fresh and cooked with an obvious love for food.  Parking is irritating, but the food is more than worth it!"}
{"text":"Traveling on business I was feeling antsy in the hotel room and decided to get out and explore downtown Charlotte last night. I read on a Chowhound article that Mert's was a good place for a solo diner to get some good local food without feeling weird for eating alone, plus it was Southern Soul Food. The experience started off on a high note with quick, friendly service producing a Carolina Blonde Beer (not local, btw, from Wilkes-Barre, PA) and the pinnacle of the experience: cornbread. The rest of the meal (my shrimp and grits) didn't live up to the hype and so I have to give this place an overall mediocre review.  Pros -Cornbread- this stuff is the truth. But I felt it set the bar high as my first  taste of Mert's capabilities. Thus while satisfying enormously with its crumbly sweet goodness and soft buttery mouth feel, it paradoxically set the table for disappointment. -Good Service and Atmosphere - again I was a solo diner and it didn't feel awkward at all. The place is casual, upbeat and friendly. Good for dropping in alone and unannounced.  Cons -Salad - the 'garden salad' is billed on the menu as a $2 add-on to your entree. I make a point of regular ruffage while traveling, so I took the bait. What I got was literally a bread plate with about an inch-deep layer of iceberg lettuce, a single slice of cucumber and a plastic cup of ranch dressing. I ordered honey mustard. This was about as 'gardeny' as a plastic-wrapped airplane salad and way too much money for what I got. I usually won't mind paying upwards of $10 for a properly vegetated salad, but for $2 this was wickedly overpriced considering an entire head of this lettuce costs about $1 retail.  -Shrimp and Grits - just ok, bordering on the meh. I wanted to like this so badly, to have the Soul Food experience I've been dreaming of. Sadly, this wasn't it. Too much grits, small shrimp lacking freshness and watery sauce throughout."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, food was ok.  Great experience!"}
{"text":"If you got 24 hrs in charlotte and need that southern comfort,  this is the place.  Chicken is on point but the the beef rib was unbelievable and stole the show.  The yams were  perfect, not too sweet.  Cornbread was a little lackluster though,  which was surprising."}
{"text":"I would say I enjoyed every bite here, but that would be an \"alternative fact.\"   I haven't seen my friend from upstate New York for almost 7 years, and when she told me she was going to be in Charlotte, I was so excited I forget to look up Mert's menu ahead of time online. Usually I need a preview, so I got there few minutes early, to buy some time to consider my options. Food for thoughts, right?  Whether you're craving some Barbecue Ribs or a large bowl of Shrimp Creole and Catfish,  Mert's Heart & Soul is where you'd find it. I had the Beef BBQ Ribs with okra and MacNCheese and didn't fall in love with it.  Three and Half Yelps"}
{"text":"Breakfast? Lunch? Breakfast? Lunch?....to Carol K's review...which I was dining with at the time...we had a nice little brunch at this Charlotte landmark eatery.  The food is good hearty downhome southern food (long live the south) and we made the most of it.  The service staff never missed a beat and kept us happy and well stocked on whatever we needed.  Throwing in a few drinks made it not a cheap brunch, but definitely a good one!"}
{"text":"Yo I have had plenty of times to taste fried chicken in my time at various eateries from South Florida to Atlanta to North Carolina. I have to say that their fried chicken was definitely top notch. Came here with my girl and two other friends who were visiting Charlotte. I looked up some spots in the city and found this place on Yelp. The decor is pretty homey, even though I felt the seats were a bit cramped. The service was pretty standard. I kept my order pretty simple...fried chicken! Also, I had cornbread which was a little bit dry but still pretty good. Overall, if you want a nice Southern dish and love fried chicken, this is a great spot to check out."}
{"text":"The best corn bread I have every had! This is definitely the place to go for southern comfort food.   I have been here several times for lunch & dinner but this past time was for breakfast. I had the shrimp and grits. There was a little too much sauce but it was still great.  The wait staff is great.  We were greeted right away. Our food came out quickly. We sat and chatted for over an hour and a half over coffee. Any waitress that walked by with a pot of coffee offered us more."}
{"text":"Holy cow this couldn't be better! Loved the cornbread, greens, shrimp and grits and the sweet potato cake I had. I'd eat here every meal if I could!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love food, saw all the great reviews and decided to check Mert's out. We started with the BBQ beef ribs and when my husband put a piece in his mouth, he made a sound that startled me! Lol. I was like what's wrong and he was like, \"Geez, this is awesome!\" I had the whiting, which was perfectly seasoned. He had the salmon cakes meal. Plates were cleaned! Great find. Oh, make sure you park in the lot where they are located as this is the only lot they can offer validation for. We did save room for desert. Peach cobbler was perfect, but the strawberry cake was way too sweet. I love sweets but even this was like an overdose."}
{"text":"So very busy at 8pm on Sunday.   Came to Charlotte while on vacation and it was on my route.  Parked at the Hearst Media Towers and just went walking.  I saw Mert's and looked up on Yelp and the reviews got me in.  Now, let's be clear on this.  This location is in a nice building, next to a nice Holiday Inn; so don't expect fancy NOTHING.    The inside looks very well broken in but yet clean and eclectic. Iron metal art sculptures with wood adorn the inside, the kitchen area is open and you can see everything.  There was only two guys back there and may GOD bless them both, they were rockin out some GREAT FLAVOR.    I was promptly seated then greeted by my server whom said she would be right back to take my order.  As I said this place was busy so I figured I would be waiting on my food.  NOT THE CASE.   As with most places I visit first I say to the servers \"Please bring me food.  Your choice, Your call.  Don't tell me.\"  Then I list what I don't eat.  I also asked for sweet tea.     Understanding that this is soul food, real soul food.  So I was excited.  The tea came, glass was clean.  The tea.  Well, the first glass went down fast and was refilled quickly by my server with a smile.    Within a few minutes my food was delivered by another server.  Fried Chicken, green beans, and mac & cheese, with cornbread.  I'm happy.     The green beans had great flavor, very nicely cooked.  The mac & cheese is incredible, was tempted to order a side bowl of this but, hey, already ate like 4 times prior.  I picked the chicken up, white meat; and tried to bite into it.  WRONG!!!!!!!!!!      I warn you, wait for 20 to 30 minutes till you can get into this.  HOW THE HECK IS IT SO HOT FOR SO LONG?  Darn..  I had to cut into it with a knife to let the heat out.  Once it was safe to eat it, I was first taken to the memory of my mothers and grandma's chicken that was made at home.  Perfectly seasoned, not greasy, but just pure flavor and moist.  I finished off several more glasses of that great sweet tea and cleaned my plate.     Total bill was about $11, I forgot to keep the receipt, but was well worth it and the server was taken very good care of.     She offered cake for desert but it was HUGE, no way I could have eaten that and still be functional to see the town that night.        Only downside to this place is that it is right off the street, so you get noise from the traffic and flies find their way in.  No biggie, they did not eat much.        So if you live within a couple of hours, this place rocks.  Service is great.   Happy Eating..."}
{"text":"If you happen to be in downtown Charlotte looking for a causal place for southern/soul food cuisine and atmosphere, then this is definitely worth a try.  Just reading the menu has entertainment value for midwesterners.  Then out comes the comfort food that'll clog your arteries.  It's not fancy, but it is filling and unique."}
{"text":"My first review was 5 stars, but upon our second visit seven months later, I'm taking away two stars for one main reason -- gnats, or perhaps they are fruit flies.  Seeing them reminded me they were a bit of an issue during our first visit as well.  As soon as our food came out, they started floating around our plates. We put our bones on a plate on the table next to us in an effort to divert them.   The food is still really good, and we appreciate the friendly service but it is a bit slow. As others have mentioned, the macaroni and cheese is quite yummy. I had blackened pork chops this time and they were well-seasoned but a tad bit dry. I'd still go back to Mert's, but if the gnats remain an issue on our next visit to Charlotte, that will probably be our last try."}
{"text":"This is the best soul restaurant!!! The soul rolls are a must have. The waitresses are so nice and helpful and are quick to fix a mix up.  I loved the place. Any time I'm in Charlotte, this is a must have!"}
{"text":"Started out with the soul rolls and ribs. Both were outstanding. I had the chopped pork (Carolina style) with red beans and okra as sides. Washed it all down with a cold Yuengling lager. This place is terrific for lunch or dinner. Right downtown and easy to find."}
{"text":"Great soul food. Came here with a friend as we wanted the true southern experience. It was a nice Saturday evening. The restaurant was fairly packed.   We decided to go with the southern sampler as an appetizer plate. Everything was large servings. The chicken wings still had the split tip. Southern spring rolls were a very nice touch.  Jamabalaya was a tad on the underwhelmed side a bit bland. The flavour was just not there for me. The collard greens, hush puppies and the corn bread were on point though. Flavourful, good serving size and presented nicely.  The restaurant has a homey feel to it. Welcoming and bustling with guests enjoying some delish Southern Soul food!"}
{"text":"Salmon cakes are delicious!! Macaroni & Cheese is delicious !! Yams were good and sweet.  This place is good for down home southern cooking. We waited about 40 minutes when he told us 20 but no biggie! It was worth the wait."}
{"text":"Not enough staff and a soft shell crab Po Boy that's bound to make your stomach hurt. The cornbread and Mac and cheese are pretty amazing though."}
{"text":"Place was packed and after reading reviews, I decided to keep an open mind. There were five people in our party and we were seated beside the register. Waitresses kept reaching over one of our party to get straws(they were sitting right behind the register). I ordered the catfish...it was ok; not completely done but seasoned well. Not sure if it was fried or shake n bake. The Mac n cheese tasted like it was cooked on the grill. Someone in our party ordered jumbo chicken wings and had to request that they be cooked more. A waiter took my MIL plate from the table without asking if she was done. They had to fix her replacement food to go. The cake wasn't fresh. The blackened chops were very good! The beef ribs should be advertised as short ribs. Our server was great; had a great personality. Don't think I will return."}
{"text":"Went to Merts last night.. The food was great and the service was exceptional, UNTIL half way through my meal, I looked next to my seat and there was a gate that housed alcohol, that wasn't the problem.. The problem was the gate was filthy! It was covered in dust bunnies and black gunk! I told the manager (I'm guessing she was the manager on duty, she couldn't have possibly been the real manager) about how unpleasant and unappetizing it was sitting next to it, so something could be done for the next guests who are seated there. But, Her attitude was TERRIBLE! I simply asked for a to go box and my bill because I immediately lost my appetite. I don't know what was nastier, the disgusting, dusty, gross gate or the \"managers\" nonchalant, barbaric, discourteous attitude.   I wish I could have gotten a picture!   But do not get me wrong, the food is AMAZING!! && the banana pudding is great! I'll probably just do take out next time."}
{"text":"I don't wish too often that I had an extra half-star to give, but in this instance I do.  The menu wasn't that diverse and the items weren't exactly what I wanted and everything inside felt physically greasy like old residual oil that never goes away, I liked my meal, my sides, and the service.  The waitress was clearly working on her birthday and she took care of us: the food came out quickly, the checks were automatically split, and containers were brought for those of us with leftovers.  The pacing of the meal was perfect--I never felt rushed and also never got concerned we would run late or be tight for our post-lunch meeting.    The food was good and I plan on going back for some of the other items--more of the turkey options, the pulled pork, and different sides.  Also the desserts looked great.  I wasn't blown away or even really excited about anything which is why I just can't justify giving four stars.  But everything went well, tasted well, etc., which is why I think they deserve more than three stars.  Oh half star, where are you, elusive one?"}
{"text":"Went to Mert's last weekend to break up a long trip home. Enjoyed the food and southern hospitality. I selected the salmon cakes which were a pretty good choice and my wife opted for the fried chicken. To kick off the meal we had the soul rolls. Interesting ambiance, bathrooms are a bit rundown, and you're a little packed inside. Expect the floor to be a bit slick. Sounds like a lot of negatives, but the food and service were both good and I'd consider stopping there again."}
{"text":"By far one of the best soul food restaurants in Charlotte!  Try the red beans/rice and turkey sausage, shrimp/grits or ribs and u won't be upset.  Diabetic onset sweet-tea and lemonade are sooo refreshing to wash down this soul-food.  Prices are very reasonable and you will nvr leave there hungry.  Service is great and I alwayz park in the parking deck around the corner."}
{"text":"Mert's is a Charlotte tradition--it's kinda the heart and soul, if you will, of Uptown Charlotte. Unassuming from the outside, it does indeed have a lot f heart and soul--you sense it as you walk into this quaint, friendly establishment. Ok, enough heart and soul usages.   Picture a backyard BBQ indoors, and that's Mert's. Friendly, knowledgeable waiters treat you like family. It's a great environment in which to enjoy a laid-back BBQ meal.   Speaking of BBQ, this place makes great stuff, and a lot of people think it's the best--or most authentic--in Charlotte. Great meat-and-three action here--try the collards and the pulled pork. The fried chicken is amazing, too, so get yourself some of that.   Simple domestic beers in bottles, which is the perfect touch to the home-cooking you're getting here. Check it out--definitely a nice change of pace from most of what you'll find downtown."}
{"text":"Great spot for your southern comfort.  I had the Salmon Cakes:  - It was done very well, the outside was perfectly crispy and the inside was soft delicious salmon.  The sauce that goes on it was delicious too, I have no idea what type of sauce it was, some type of spicy mayo; superb.  - Candied yams that came on the side was perfect for my sweet tooth.  - Corn bread.  Not the best that I've had, but a good balance between moist and dry.  - Macaroni + Cheese, was good, nothing too special, but still good.  - Service.  Was great.  I told them that I needed to leave quickly and hop on a plane.  They took my orders quickly, brought my food out quickly, and cashed me out quick.  I could appreciate it.  And the waitress was very personable."}
{"text":"On a weekend band trip for the NCAA tournament, we came the first time to Mert's because we saw it had been featured on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives. The second time we came because of the delicious food, caring service, and AMAZING cake!  Our must haves (I ordered it again the second time) were the soul rolls, the fall-off-the-bone fried chicken, and the coconut cake! Seriously, we tried lots of the their wonderful options: lemon, German chocolate, banana, yellow with chocolate...but the coconut takes the cake. All were super moist and just the right sweetness!  Both times we were taken care of by the sweetest waitresses and surprised by how great the prices were. If I'm ever down in NC again, I'll definitely return to Mert's!"}
{"text":"Orders shrimp and grits Togo. I received gravy with a side of grits. My meal is totally soupy. Not to mention the bread was placed on top of the gravy soup cause that to be soggy by the time I got home. This was a waste of $15 bucks and a loss of appetite. Thanks for nothing...  Sweet tea and muffin were good though."}
{"text":"I really love this place. The Mac and cheese was excellent! The cornbread is really sweet I throughly enjoyed it!!!!! Great location and they even validate parking at some of the nearby parking locations. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"The food here is stellar.  I love the shrimp and grits the most.  Well, that's my favorite dinner.   The best thing here is the cornbread.  My lord do I love the cornbread.  I also think the collard greens, while a bit more vinegary than others, are phenomenal.  They even do Mac and Cheese well, which is rare uptown.    Parking is tough - the best option is at the Epicenter."}
{"text":"We have a 7-hour stop over to Charlotte going to NYC and decided to go downtown. Mert's fried chicken, salmon cake and corn bread are to die for. We finally satisfied our Southern food craving and it was an amazing dining experience at Mert's."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place more than I actually did.  Starting with a positive - the cornbread was sensational, served piping hot with honey butter.  Our server 'fessed up it was made with mayo when I pressed for deets.  Lawdy have mercy!  It was durn good though.  The fried chicken was just as excellent as you expect.  Collards and okra got a thumbs up from me.  Okay - now for the negs - The salmon cakes were downright not good.   Disappointing, as they were touted as a featured menu item on their website.  I wonder if I just got them on a bad day??  They were mushy, with no discernible salmon chunks, and flavorless, desperately needing spices or at least salt.  I saw and tasted no evidence of the mirepoix and Cajun spices described as part of the dish.  Hubs didn't like his green beans (too sweet) and home fries (too bland, not fried long enough).    I like the vibe of the space a lot.  But it does seem a little dirty.  Also our server was very friendly but repeatedly sneezed into the crook of her arm and just kept on serving.  Um, kinda gross from a customer perspective.  She also mixed our ticket up with another tables, but then let us know that she would cover the extra on their ticket for us.  They were busy.  These things happen.    All in all, I think this is worth a visit for out of towners, especially if you are staying right down town.  But, I'll try somewhere else next time I'm in Charlotte - hence 3 stars."}
{"text":"Gotta like everything about this spot: the warm and cozy ambience, genuine and friendly staff and great food.   They got the fundamentals down: batter, gravy and everything else.  Gotta stop by again and try the banana bread pudding pancake on weekends."}
{"text":"Accidentally found this place on my lunch break. It's a small little restaurant with a casual vibe and friendly staff. I'm a sucker for Mac and cheese and an all around plain Jane. I ordered the tenders, home fries and Mac and cheese. I ordered and went to the bathroom and when I came back my food was ready. Like they were freaky fast. The tenders and honey mustard were pretty good. The cornbread is drrrryyyyyyyyyy my goodness. They need a honey drizzle ASAP. The Mac and cheese was slightly above average but needed some more cheese. I ordered the chocolate cake for dessert. Also dry. Waste of calories and $5. Id try them again but the first whirl was pretty average."}
{"text":"Looking for some soul food? Head over to Mert's Heart and Soul in Uptown Charlotte. This casual restaurant definitely brings the soul to uptown with its fried green tomatoes, ribs and fried chicken. One of my favorite things is the sampler dish that they provide as an appetizer. It gives you a taste of some of their best items, including the salmon cake (like a crab cake). I'm obsessed with their fried green tomatoes and suggest getting more of the sauce on the side. Another awesome quality of Mert's is that they give you a big helping of food! I haven't been able to finish a meal, which it great for leftovers the next day. I would suggest staying away from the pork chop... it's spicy, not very tender and it doesn't come with gravy/sauce so it makes the food a little hard to swallow! But i would suggest getting the ribs or the turkey sausage Kiebasa. Also 10/10 recommend the okra and tomatoes as a side and the sweet tea is on point. Mert's has my heart!"}
{"text":"Mertz, you have two new fans.  Upon arrival we had to wait about 15 minutes but the young man in his 20's with the short locs was definitely hustling to get everyone seated as quickly as possible.  Our waitress was hustling as well as the place was busy yet she managed to provide us with attentive service.  Most of my food was good.  I ordered the salmon cakes with mac and cheese and collards.  The collards were definitely too tough but tasty.  They could've been cooked a tad bit longer to reach perfection.  The price was definitely right and they also validate parking!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I ate there for the first time yesterday, October 30, 2016 Service sucks!! I accidentally left my phone on the table.  I asked the hostess and the manager did someone see your phone.. they acted with attitude and basically wanted us to leave the premises.. and no one in the whole entire restaurant knew where or what happened to the phone.. UNTIL I was on the phone with the police, and show them That I was tracking the phone and it was still in the building. But everyone in this the restaurant didn't know where the phone was answered presently when the police is on the way the phone magically appeared in the restaurant. James the cook was one of the guys we ask for help he gave us the same attitude as the rest of the waitstaff UNTIL I had to get the police involved. And James magically found the phone..  The food was not tasteful at all, my macaroni and cheese was very cold, I had the fried catfish with barbecue beef ribs, The catfish was cold and robbery, my ribs was very heart and tough and cold. My fiancé had the fried chicken with catfish the chicken was very bland no season at all, his sweet potatoes was very hard and cold.  Just out right very unprofessional staff food was not good at all. I would never return to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Mert's Heart & Soul?  Thank you Charlotte for introducing me to this place!  The food is fantastic!  The fried chicken was a lot better the second time I went. I'm not sure what changed.  The collard greens were so good.  Now I'm not a cornbread eater but you really have to try theirs. Also, the service great!"}
{"text":"Went on a road trip from Chicago to Wilmington. This was the best food we had the entire trip-and we ate at a lot of local restaurants thru Kentucky, North Carolina & Tennessee!  We had blackened catfish, collars greens, black eyed peas, cornbread, banana pudding-all to die for ! Delicious! Good service and friendly"}
{"text":"I admit I'm a California boy whose closest experience with soul food was watching that scene with Aretha Franklin in The Blues Brothers 30 years ago.  So probably not qualified to make a definitive review for all y'all.  :)  I wanted to keep it as authentic as possible, and ordered the shrimp on grits with sweet potato cake for dessert.  It was pretty good.  The service certainly was slow, but I just chalked it up to the whole \"slow and easy\" Southern experience.  In fact, my waitresses reassurance to me as she left the check was:  \"Don't worry about it; just take your time....\""}
{"text":"This was the first restaurant I went to while in North Carolina and boy did they set the bar high. Our server was super nice, always checking up on us. She even gave us recommendations to places to go, not sure if it's just southern hospitality or she's just that nice.   I got the shrimp and grits. It was the best shrimp and grits I ever had to date. The sauce was flavorful and the shrimp were decent size. For appetizers, we got the soul roll, which is an egg roll filled with a meaty filling. It was good, definitely something different. They also give cornbread instead of rolls. The cornbread were so good!   Overall, a good place to eat with nice service. The restaurant looks normal nothing fancy, but the food won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Admittedly, I'm a soul food diva. Born and raised in Louisiana. I grew up cooking and eating it. And this place was a disappointment. I had fried chicken, greens and yams. The chicken lacked flavor and had a hint of a freezer-burn taste, the greens were undercooked and not stemmed, the yams were too soupy and didn't have a stitch of a homemade taste. In fact, they tasted like a jazzed up canned version. All of this and then to top it off, the customer service was poor. I'm new to CLT, and read all of the Yelp reviews before dining here. Queen City, if this is as good as it gets for soul food here, that's pretty darn scary. One star for the location only."}
{"text":"The food, atmosphere, and service was impeccable. Tried the soul egg rolls and it almost blew my head off with how great it was. Moved on to the fried chicken with Mac n cheese and it changed my life. And last but not least we had the desert...man oh man was it good. Tried the red velvet cake, sweet potato cake, and the German chocolate. All 3 out of this world. Definitely returning next time in the Queen City."}
{"text":"Really good food if you want southern soul food. There were enough options for vegetarians as well. The corn bread was the best I've ever had. The decor isn't the fanciest, but the food was delicious and generous. Could be a little cleaner inside, but for a quick southern style meal, give it a try."}
{"text":"I have to say it's not what I expected.  The salmon patties were pink and looked undone and yuck!  Our waitress was not very polite although we told her that was our first time there and we had some questions about the way the menu listed some items.  The food is southern but not the hospitality!  I love Charlotte but I can't say I would go back there.  The rest of the meal was average at best."}
{"text":"The Salmon cakes are the best item on the menu. I pair it with cabbage as my side. The cornbread is sinful and it is served with honey butter; a perfect combo! I visit Mert's each time that I am in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"All I can say is YUMMM!!! My fiance and I are new to Charlotte so this was our first try at true Southern style soul food. Mert's was not a disappointment. The service was friendly. Very cozy southern feeling atmosphere. Very casual and chill and best of all, not overpriced!   Biggest recommendations: The cornbread is to die for!!! OMG! The chicken is wonderful and the mac and cheese is soooo good!   Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"I used to live in Charlotte several years ago and whenever I return, I never miss a chance to go to my absolute favorite authentic comfort soul food restaurant.  I always order one of my favorite all-time meals: fried chicken thigh, mac & cheese and yams (beware - they're candied!) with a sweet tea.  You also get a mini-loaf of corn bread with honey butter.  Best meal ever!    The waitstaff is always super casual and exude the \"southern charm\" you expect from a southern diner.    Most people who live in Charlotte already know about Mert's (it has been there forever)... But if you're visiting Charlotte, do yourself a favor and stop in for a meal - you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Hands down best real cornbread in the Charlotte area ( Jim and nicks is a different type). The menu is pretty decent too. I had the salmon cakes and they were great. My fiance had the turkey kielbasa which was also good."}
{"text":"SOUTHERN COOKIN and SOUTHERN HOSPITALITY to the MAX! This Cali girl was floored. When I came in...I thought people confused me for a loyal local...but no...they are just that nice. I had the blackened catfish with rice and veggies. The cornbread was on point! I hope to hit this place up again when I return to Charlotte!"}
{"text":"If only there wasn't a person growing inside me... I so wanted to eat everything on my plate, and could only cry to myself as I watched Andrew finish off the last morsels of yummy-ness.   The cornbread: Warm, fresh, delicious.  The mac'n'cheese: How it should be - gooey cheesiness with a slightly crunchy top reminding you of how lovingly prepared it is.  The chopped pork: droooooooool.  Be prepared to be squished though, it's tight spaces and big, loud crowds enjoying their meal, so if you don't like being cozy, then stay outside."}
{"text":"Hands down best cornbread I've ever had.  It's everything you want cornbread to be:  warm, caky, sweet, and last but not least de-freakin-licous!  Ok, now on to the food.  I've been here twice and each time I couldn't force myself to order anything but the fried chicken.  When I go to a Southern restaurant serving soul food I have a really hard time ordering anything else.  The chicken is moist, macaroni is rich, and the collards are full of flavor.    Both times we've been, the place has been packed.  They do a nice job getting you seated in a reasonable amount of time.  There isn't much of a waiting area though so it gets rather cramped when you do have to wait."}
{"text":"This is the only restaurant I had the chance to visit when I was in Charlotte last weekend and I was not disappointed.  I was warned that it is a hole in the wall, but it's not.  Just a casual restaurant.  We arrived around 2pm on a Saturday and were quickly seated.  After ordering, our food arrived about 10 minutes later.  I had the fried chicken with mac n cheese and greens.  And because I'm greedy and have no shame I also got a side of mashed taters (just so I could try them).  I really enjoyed my food.  It was hot and delicious.  The mac n cheese was very cheesy and satisfying.  The mashed taters were lumpy like I like it.  And the cornbread was good too.  A nice little loaf with some creamy, sweet butter.  I think my meal was about 10 bucks with a drink.   My only complaint is that the portions were kinda small.  Maybe I'm just used to bigger portions in Atlanta, but I could have enjoyed 1/4 more food.  The service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"I give Mert's a high three stars for my first visit. It definitely delivered on my craving for a buttery, salty hot meal. Oh, and some cheese.  The hubs and I rolled up on a Saturday around 2:30 p.m., fearing that no Uptown kitchen is open at such an in-between hour. Au contraire. Mert's was packed. Inside this low-ceilinged nook with couple dozen tables, colorful accents and storied photographs lining the walls, we found couples, families and friends of all ages going to town on some comfort food.  I had the Carolina chopped BBQ, swimming in a sweet, \"secret\" sauce. Served in a side-dish bowl, the Q portion left plenty of room for gooey mac and cheese and a substantial serving of collard greens with the right amount of tang. The hubs had the lowcountry omelette, which was OK for him; he said he'd go for something more fried and/or savory next time (atta boy).  We shared an appetizer of fried green tomatoes--tasty though a tad too bready and lukewarm upon arrival. The app came out after our entrees, but honestly when you've come to indulge in this kind of hearty goodness, does it matter?  And then there was the cornbread. There was a wait for it. Our server was repeatedly apologetic. But oh, was it worth it.  Our server was so very friendly and kept us happy with regular check-ins and refills on sweet tea. My only random nit was the vinyl table covering. I trust it's clean, but there's something kinda sticky about those things still. Otherwise, Mert's is a good-for-all destination for a casual feast of stick-to-your-ribs Southern cookin'."}
{"text":"Ard took a picture of his beef ribs with his Blackberry.   Five minutes later: \"It's got 25 Likes! Damn, people are hungry! The economy *is* bad!\"  If a mere picture of Mert's ribs gets 25 likes, imagine how many their flavor would get.   We stopped by after the wildly entertaining nuttiness of Speed Street. After a couple of beers on a hot night, all you need is grease to soak up the booze. That said, Mert's delivered, not greasy food, but high-quality, delicious, heavy Southern food that will absorb anything left in your system, and leave some cholesterol as a gift with purchase.   I got the Soul Rolls, essentially soulified egg rolls, with black eye peas, collard greens, rice, and a wee bit of diced chicken breast (though I didn't taste much of the chicken. Could have just been my particular rolls, tho). The others got varying dishes of fried chicken and beef ribs, with sides of fries, mac & cheese, collard greens, and the works.   \"You know, if I worked here, they would find me in the back with my head in a bucket of this mac & cheese,\" Ard said.  Yep, basically. Some of the best mac & cheese I've ever had in a restaurant.   Service is great here, too. Everyone was so patient with the troops of drunk teenagers who wandered in to use the bathroom, despite the sign on the door that read, \"Bathrooms for paying customers only.\" Our server, Netta, made sure that I ordered first, as a fellow Netta. So nice!   I think there's enough reviews here to cover ambiance, so I won't go on about that. But Mert's is cozy and the food is delish. Go enjoy!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and vibe! My classmates recommended this place and it didn't disappoint.   5stars for service and ambiance.    3stars for food. I didn't know the yams were candied--otherwise I would have ordered something else b/c the yams were too sweet for me. I felt like it could have been eaten with ice cream as dessert. My friend and I had never tried collard greens so we ordered that; it was an interesting taste combo of spinach and kale. Not my favorite but I'm glad I tried it! The hockey itself was crispy and not too oily.   The CORNBREAD was the best I've ever had--hot and fresh from the oven!  Even though I'm not a huge fan of southern comfort food, I thought it was pretty good. Next time I'd want to order something with the spicy creole sauce!"}
{"text":"Deeeeeeelicious!  Split the pork BBQ plate w/collards & yams with a friend who got the salmon cakes.  Both were wonderful.  We're moving in as soon as possible.  Or at least going for breakfast tomorrow morning!"}
{"text":"Yummy! ...This place has def left a good impression on us, chicken was delicious lightly seasoned and crispy,rice and green beans were just like grandmas (well almost, sorry grams) ribs were pretty good  as well as their coleslaw and potatoes.  OH my! can't forget their corn bread warm and crispy on top it just fell apart in softness and goodness of flavor. I heard their Mac&cheese and Yums are very good as well, I didn't get a chance to try them it was just like a home cooked meal, very reasonable prices, is not a fancy place, just a casual atmosphere. If you are visiting the city and want to enjoy some southern flavor, stop by at Mert's you will enjoy it."}
{"text":"Visited Mert's during a conference in Charlotte.  I was hoping to get some good southern fried food, and I was not disappointed by Mert's!  The Mac n' cheese, tasty cornbread and bbq ribs were incredible satisfying.  My friends and I ordered the Southern Sampler appetizer mainly because we wanted the fried green tomatoes, which turned out alright.  We ended up having an overload of cornbread as it comes complimentary, came in the sampler, and also came with our main dishes.  Left very stuffed and happy.  I recommend this restaurant as it seems much more \"family-run\" than the other franchises/chains that dot the streets in uptown/downtown Charlotte."}
{"text":"This place was a huge disappointment- unfortunately.  Made a special trip downtown to eat here after picking up a friend from the airport before heading out on the road.  First of all, this location is downtown- very limited parking- so be prepared to pay to park unless you get lucky and get an actual available street spot- very unlikely though.  We found parking in a garage and had to pay $8....umm, not cool!  Upon arriving at the restaurant- it was very slow- but it was around 3 pm.  The ambiance was good and our server was polite and semi-attentive.   The cornbread is great; yet they are pretty stingy with the butter....so be prepared to request more or use sparingly especially if sharing.  I ordered the fried catfish along with yams & Mac n' cheese.  The catfish tasted really muddy/dirty - such a disappointment because it had a great batter on it- but I had to drown it in their unimpressive  and tasteless tartar sauce and some siracha ketchup just to drown out the dirt taste.....the yams were so-so and the Mac n' cheese wasn't very memorable.  The other person in my party ordered the vegetable plate....again yams, Mac n' cheese, and potato salad....her comments matched mine in the similar dishes and as for the potato salad- her comments were that it was just ok.   She got a garden Salad and it was the smallest-saddest little garden salad.  I suppose that maybe since this restaurant was featured in triple \"D\" - then we had high expectations....just wasn't blown away by our meal and there was nothing to crave to make me want to come back.  So disappointed....."}
{"text":"My body was telling me no, but my heart was telling me yes towards the end of my meal. I just wanted to keep eating, savoring each bite despite being so full I could puke. My lips were doing that quivering thing from being so full. This was one of the most memorable meals I've ever had.  Conveniently located in the heart of downtown, Mert's is the textbook example of what soul food means. The environment is casual and affordable, a bit jazzy, and very Southern. I felt like I was in a grandmother's kitchen, full of history and down home hospitality.  My run down of this epic meal can't do the flavors justice.   The cornbread was the best I've ever had, no competition. It was thick, warm, not crumbly, very sweet. It was a meal in itself.   The green beans were prepared in such a way that leads me to believe this is not a choice for the health minded. They were juicy, wonderfully greasy, and contained spots of other wonderful veggies and greens.  The candied yams were a treat. Each bite melts in your mouth as the flavors build in your mouth. A tad of cinnamon, a tad of syrup, a lot of velvety sweet potatoey love. My husband told me that these were the best thing he's ever eaten in his life.  Finally, the fried chicken breast was something of legend. The exterior texture was addicting but not salty or typical in anyway. The poultry itself had a ton if depth in terms of flavor, and tasted as if each inch of it was personally marinated somehow with a hint of smokiness, rotisserie, sweetness, peppery... Just a bit of everything. There isn't a fried chicken that can come close to Mert's as far as I'm concerned.   If you are in the Charlotte area, Mert's is a must. Not eating here would be the biggest missed opportunity while visiting. You can feel the love here: for the city and inside the food."}
{"text":"I'm only in Charlotte for a month and plan on frequenting as many eateries as possible. Merts popped up on my radar after looking for a lunch spot open on a Sunday. Given that yelp only rated this place as a 3.5 stars, I was hesitant on going, but I really wanted to venture out and fill my stomach with Southern cuisine.  I purposely went early to avoid the lunchtime crowds and there was more than enough seats available. I debated between the fried chicken and shrimp dishes the night prior and settled on the shrimp Creole since there were mixed ratings on the chicken. However, when I told nut waitress that I have never tried grits before, she highly suggested that I try their shrimp and grits. And with that, my order for shrimp and grits went through. My waitress appeared within minutes with their famous cornbread. I am not really a fan of the dry, crumbly texture of cornbread on general, but this cornbread was moist and bursting of flavor. I now knew what was so great about their cornbread.  After several minutes, my order of shrimp and grits arrived. I wasnt expecting much given that grits do not have the greatest reputation--I heard they are bland, mealy, and literally gritty in texture. With a spoonful of brown gravy, shrimp, tomatoes, onions, and grits, I had a taste. This was Southern comfort food at its finest--the type that transports you to another era...back to the kitchen you grew up in. Granted, I'm not from the South but I could tell that this dish was made with soul. The buttery, creamy grits with the flavorful gravy and crunch of the onions. The shrimp were large and plump and well paired with the gravy. The focaccia bread was also great in soaking up the gravy.  For allb those looking for comfort food, try the shrimp and grits. Forget the fried chicken because you will be missing out on good ol' low country meals."}
{"text":"I saw this place on Diners Drive Ins and Dives talking about the Soul Roll and how it's so amazing.  Given the location, there will never ever be a day when I walk in and sit down because I hate trying to navigate downtown Charlotte so I opt for the next best thing and had Postmates bring Merts's to my office.    I ordered the Soul Rolls, some friend green tomatoes, a cup of chicken soup and also a bowl of chicken soup for two of my co workers.  The first thing they both said was that the soup was salty, but given the menu I was already expecting the salt to be heavy so their comment didn't surprise me.  Even after a lengthy delivery process my Soul Rolls were indeed tasty; maybe contained too much black eyed pea and not enough chicken?  But certainly not a deal breaker.  The fried green tomatoes were tasty too and I finished them quickly.    They seemed to specialize in low country fish and sea food dishes, none of which I'm a big fan of but if you like that sort of cuisine, then Mert's is the place for you  :-)"}
{"text":"I ordered fried chicken, greens, red beans and corn bread.  The fried chicken was delicious.  Crispy and moist, the chicken itself was really tasty.  The greens were good, solid but nothing special.  The beans really needed seasoning.  The corn bread was perfect.  I also ordered the fried green tomato appetizer.  These had a really tough breading and needed a better accompaniment.  I also wish they had Tobasco or Louisianna Hot Sauce because Texas Pete and whatever Mexican and Vietnamese sauces just aren't really appropriate with this food in my opinion.  I wouldn't have needed it but everything needed a bit of something.  This is really a 3 1/2 star place for me.  I love the place itself and the service has always been pretty good, the prices are very good too.  This is a good place to go if you are downtown."}
{"text":"I didn't grow up eating southern cooking but I love fried chicken, biscuits and gravy, and banana pudding just as well. So needless to say I had high hopes for Mert's.   I went with the buttermilk and herb chicken fingers which sounded incredible. They were about $11 and came with two sides. Overall they felt flat and had an overwhelming garlic taste that became too much after one or two (and I love garlic -fyi)  I don't think I could eat them again. The Mac n Cheese as my side was a saving grace. Wow-awesome! Cheesy-stringy deliciousness and I ate it right up. My other side was the mashed potatoes which tasted great at first bite but again became overwhelming fast. Perhaps if I went with a veggie side I would have felt better but the food was so rich I felt queasy by the end. My boyfriend ate my cornbread as I don't care for that myself, and he liked it quite a bit.   I had a bite of my boyfriends steak and eggs which were way overcooked and the steak was literally coated with grease - definitely not my type of thing. He said it was pretty average if a bit overcooked for him as well.   I thought for the food quality it was a bit overpriced (but pretty standard for the area) and overall I just felt like everything was too salty, greasy, and rich for my own taste buds. Now I know you're probably saying well look what you ordered and perhaps that is true, but I have had fried chicken and mashed potatoes that felt decadent yet somehow less like my mouth was taking a grease bath.  If I went again I would order something MUCH lighter...lesson learned.   On a positive note the service was fast and friendly and the restaurant itself has a lot of memorabilia that makes for interesting conversation pieces. So for me Mert's is just ok."}
{"text":"I went to Mert's twice and both times everything was good. The first time I went was New Year's Day for their brunch and I was kinda nervous. Most places don't have good food on a holiday so I wasn't sure what to expect. However, everything was good. It was so good in fact I didn't have to fight with my 4 year old to eat. We got fried chicken, greens, grits, eggs, hoppin johns, and whatever else was in the buffet. We were allowed to take our desserts to go and we got banana pudding, banana pudding cake, and chocolate cake. All of which was very good. We went back a few weeks later when my mother came to visit and she enjoyed it as well. It's definitely a place to try when in the mood for soul food while downtown."}
{"text":"OMG.  The best!  We love this place!  We visit a couple times per year on business trips to Charlotte.  Service is great and consisten (same folks year to year).  Fried chicken was THE BEST....unless of course you are talking homemade cakes.  We usually sneak a couple slices back to our hotel room.  WE LOVE THIS PLACE"}
{"text":"Stepped out of the International Trade Center and BAM!! there it was.  Soul food ??  I had to try it.  It did not disappoint.  They had a meat loaf special so I went for the meat loaf and a small salad.  It was very good, of course with lots of gravy.  I saved the last two bites to try with some ketchup; still very good.  Portions not giant sized but I got a full meal and wasn't sick afterwards.  Reasonably priced - looks like I will be BACK !!"}
{"text":"I loved this place!!!! My husband and I were fresh off the plane and went straight here because of all the good things we heard. Let me tell you, it did not disappoint!! I love that they give you warm cornbread with your meal, so delicious. I had fried catfish w. collard greens and mac & cheese. I was so happy with it. My honey got pulled pork w/ mac& cheese and coleslaw. Everything was delicious. Try the peach cobbler if it's available....very good. The service was great and I loved the old school motown music they played."}
{"text":"Great great food. Grits were my husbands favorite. Can't wait to go again. It will probably be every Sunday after we leave church. Delicious southern food."}
{"text":"Great spot for comfort food! Large portions and great value. The cornbread loaves they bring out before the meal are so cute. I wanted to try the famous salmon cakes and they did not dissapoint. Was trying to stay on the healthy side so I got collard greens and rice. The rice had great flavor! My boyfriend got the fried catfish and I was surprised at how good it was! Absolutely delicious. Did not care for the mac and cheese. Did not taste homemade like I expected. My favorite thing was the remolaude they served with both of our dishes, I would put that on anything and everything."}
{"text":"I got the fried chicken wings. They were large and juicy. Excellent with Texas Pete hot sauce. I got a side item of macaroni. Hubby got the salmon cakes and they were quite small. He said they were good but not worth the price. Server was tentative at first but seriously disappeared for a long time. I noticed the manager staring at us and she finally got out server and I can see her saying something to her about us waiting forever. She finally gave us the check and we waited another 5 minutes to pick it up. Once she picked up our check, we waited another 10 minutes to give us our card back. Service was a little slow. Overall she was friendly and the hostess greeted us outside. Nice atmosphere and food is decent."}
{"text":"The cornbread was great, i had the smothered chicken lunch special with greens and string beans and everything was good. I'd give the food 3.5 stars but the place and the people were great which bumps it up a half star to 4 stars."}
{"text":"The shrimp Creole with catfish was awesome.   Not many places like this at home.  Great service and food."}
{"text":"Cool, casual atmosphere set in the heart of downtown Charlotte.  The only cornbread I've ever had that's the equal of this is served at Club 83 in Memphis, and I've NEVER had green beans this good!"}
{"text":"Great vibe, close location to our hotel, you could smell the bacon wafting on our walk to the eat! Staff was very nice!"}
{"text":"The food was beyond salty. When I left this place my mouth was so dried out from the salted Mac n Cheese  I left there drinking a half of gallon of water . I literally had no saliva in my mouth from eating their food. I don't eat meat so I ordered the Mac n Cheese, Yams and Cabbage. The cabbage was literally  watered down. I rate this place with one star bc the waiter Divonne always remained professional.    Mertz please cook healthier food!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday afternoon (around 2P) while for a quick visit to Charlotte. I was greeted immediately and seated. I ordered and my food came out within 5 minutes (raised eyebrows because I ordered fried chicken). The food was simply ok- it was more salted than I would have preferred."}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for this place but it fell short in many ways. I had their fried green tomatoes and for $6, I got 4 slices of skinny green tomatoes, deep fried and over battered.  Tried their fried chicken, it wsa crispy but why is the portion so small. The table cloth is grimy and sticky..  Try a Waffle house and I think you'll have a better dining experience."}
{"text":"Unfortunately my family and I were unimpressed. I gave them 2 stars for their cornbread, it was really good.  Everything was surprisingly not well seasoned or just not good. We had fried green tomatoes, beef ribs, Mac and cheese, fried catfish, and yams. We also had the coconut cake which was really good but they order their cakes from a bakery so I can't give them credit for that. The worse disappointment wasn't their food, it was the \"greeter\". As soon as you try to walk in, like you would any establishment, she was there to quickly push us out saying we had to wait outside for our table. Ok that's fine but instead of pushing customers out of the restaurant, the professional thing to do would be to stand outside and nicely greet customers before they walk up to the door.  All the people standing outside - the common conversation was looking at each other saying \"what's her problem?\". The only reason I stayed was because I had family with me and we're fans of Guy Fieri who visited the place and said they good food on his show. Unfortunately I disagree with him about their food.  Once we got inside and was seated, our waitress was extremely pleasant which did make up for the rudeness we experienced earlier."}
{"text":"First time visiting North Carolina and I was told this was the place to go to! Went on a Wednesday night and was seated immediately. Our server Daris had great customer service and great recommendations from the menu! I indulged and had the chicken wing platter and my boyfriend had the catfish platter. We were very satisfied with everything and for our portions the price was reasonable ! Would definitely recommend !"}
{"text":"This review I would say would be a pretty weak 4 star.  First time here. I was in town for a conference and me and my friends just did Crossfit so I asked the concierge at my hotel to direct me to a place where I can get my grub on...   He asks like chicken and stuff? I said like Mac and cheese and ribs and all that Good stuff lol and this is where it brought me.  It's a small southern comfort food style place. My expectations ran high as I saw Guy Fieri \"was here\". Plus who could go wrong with comfort food right?  The restaurant hours didn't close till about half an hour after we walked in.  And one of the waiters didn't want to sit us in his area because he didn't want to serve any more tables on his side. Well thanks Pal. The restaurant really isn't that big.  Anywhooooo...  We ordered and our waitress was kind of snappy. I guess she was overwhelmed and tired that day that she wanted to close the restaurant already.   I wanted to order the ribs with Mac and cheese and string bean. But the waitress informed us there wasn't anymore. Okay... How about the corn on the cob? We're out of that too.   As I grew frustrated and hungry, I just opted out totally off the second side dish. Out of everything , I was looking forward to the Mac and cheese more than anything.  Our cornbread came right away, served nice and warm. delicious! But our entrees took a while.  Then a miracle happened! The kitchen staff was so kind enough to make a batch of fresh Mac and cheese. Praise the Lord!  And purely because of that reason, I gave them one extra star for that really kind gesture.  Our food came and it really was a mouthful. My ribs was DROWNED in sauce and oil. Tasted good like any other ribs to me. Mac and cheese was great. String bean was really soggy . I don't know if it should look like that on purpose.  Price is around $8 and up and they do have combos.  Personally, I didn't think this place was that special. Just a good Comfort food place that's all.  Recommend for a grub."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices, great staff, great atmosphere. Go here!  Had the breaded chicken special with okra and cabbage and it was amazing.  Tons of flavor and perfect portions!  Southern cookin at its finest."}
{"text":"The cornbread was amazing!! I had take it home. It is very filling. The soul rolls were great as well."}
{"text":"yumm!!! love the fried chicken, corn bread and collard greens.  staff were super nice and friendly. total southern hospitality!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in here on a Saturday night when it was VERY cold outside.  The place was packed but we were able to grab the only table for two left, which was right by the door.  We were immediately greeted and our drink order was taken. I got water and a lemonade, and my husband just got water.  The lemonade was the real deal!  Lemon juice, sugar syrup, water.  It was excellent.  We ordered our food, and handed back our menus.  I kid you not, 5 minutes later, the runner was bringing our food out!  I almost told her it wasn't ours, because I thought it couldn't possibly come out that fast!  Not only was the food fast, it was excellent.  We got the shrimp po'boy with mac and cheese, the Soul Sampler, and the blueberry cream cheese cake.  The food was to die for.  So delicious. The service was friendly and prompt.  I can't wait to go back here to try more!"}
{"text":"Cornbread!! So yummy.  We took our friend visiting here for some \"soul food\" and Mert's did not disappoint.  Come with an appetite!"}
{"text":"If you're in Charlotte and need of down-home cooking, this is the place. Just like your momma and grandma make. That mac and cheese is ridiculous and the corn bread is bangin'."}
{"text":"Mert's isn't necessarily what you'd expect to find in the middle of Uptown, but man the food is excellent! It doesn't lack that casual southern character that makes you feel at home, especially with all the waitstaff in t shirts and jeans.  My girlfriend and I came in for lunch, decided on our orders and were pleasantly surprised when the food arrived in just 2-3 minutes. With nearly all of the food made ahead of time cafeteria style with just a quick sear needed to finish off some items and no finishing touches for most others, you might worry that the quality suffers but it did not in our experience! I ordered the salmon cakes with collards and mac & cheese and she got the chopped bbq with green beans and mac & cheese. The salmon cakes were amazing.. no other way to describe it, just order them! The remoulade on the side makes them even better too. The chopped bbq was very good as well. For the sides, the collards and green beans were both tasty choices but the mac & cheese stole the show. So gooey and cheesy, classic baked macaroni & cheese like mom/grandma used to make. The cornbread was good but nothing special. I would have guessed that the salmon patties or mac were what Mert's was famous for rather than the cornbread tbh.  Overall, the food was fairly inexpensive and came out very quickly, but the taste was amazing and the portions were very large. Add on the fact that the waiters were friendly and that's about all I ask for in a restaurant experience!"}
{"text":"Wow!  What else can I say?  I definitely went into a sugar coma, but it was worth it.  The meal started with amazing scratch made cornbread.  We asked for the favorites and received beef ribs, catfish and chicken.  All were great and the sides were perfect.  The best was the mashed potatoes... you read that correctly.  How can you make an ordinary dish so exciting?  The yams were a desert all their own.  We finished the meal with a red velvet cake by recommendation and it was not as good as the recommendation.  It was a great experience that I really enjoyed. Thanks Harold from the Hyatt for the recommendation."}
{"text":"Great place to get soul food in the city. You will have to wait for a table on weekends. The wait staff is personable, but seem to be spread thin tending to the crowds of patrons that frequent the restaurant. They aren't the cleanest restaurant, the bathrooms are gross."}
{"text":"Over all the food was good. I ordered chicken and 2 sides. Collard greens and mashed potato.  I went on a thursday night and had to wait about 35min for food I ordered to go. The place was packed so that normally says that the place is good. And I don't have any complaints besides the wait. Good news was they had a bar next door so I went and had a beer then came back to get food. But had to wait another 15min. Well I actually did not like the greens it was very plain no flavor. The mashed potato was very good though. I would deff go here again for a cheap light meal. Oh yes I also ordered banana pudding. That was ok nothing I would order again."}
{"text":"I REEEEAAALLY wanted to like Mert's...Any place that has Heart and Soul in the name has to be delicious in my opinion. First, I will say, I will give Mert's another chance in the future. I went on a Friday night after work and it was crammed full.  I took that as a good sign because that many people here has to say something right?? We were quickly seated, the food came out fast and I don't really have any complaints about that.I ordered the Salmon Cakes with mashed potatoes and green beans. I thought this would be a glowing review based on what I'd heard, and how crazy busy the place was.  The salmon cakes were pretty good, potatoes were so so, and I don't even remember if the green beans were good... I'm just sort of disappointed based on what I thought it would be like. The service was ok, nothing extraordinary and I felt the same about the food I ordered. Shortly after walking out, my stomach was so upset, and stayed that way for a couple of days. The best thing about this place was the corn bread, and the sweet butter. Perhaps next time I'll listen to the other reviews and go for the chicken?"}
{"text":"OMG,,,,,,my first time going and the food and service was awesome !!!! The Mac-cheese was to die for,,,the corn bread was right from the oven and I could not get enough"}
{"text":"SUMMARY:  This was about the 6th time I've dined at Mert's.  First time since joining Yelp.  I was disappointed by the exceptionally long time it took for dinner to be brought to our table and by the terrible version of BBQ they offer.    DETAILS: We were promptly seated and had our drink order taken.  The drinks came right, and the appetizer (soul sampler) came out in a very reasonable time.  But it took at least another 20 minutes (maybe even 30) to get our entrees: BBQ with sides, and blackened pork chops with sides. And while the sides and chops all got good comments, we did NOT like the very molasses-heavy BBQ.  This is nothing like I've ever eaten in North or South Carolina (and I'm a native).  That needs to be revamped or better disclaimed on the menu.  Anyway, so unlike my previous visits, I left very disappointed and unfortunately, left my out-of-town friends with a bad impression of what has usually been a good place."}
{"text":"Food - All the side dishes were very tasty. Mac and cheese was cheesy and yummy. I added pepper tho. The greens were good, not too sweet or salty. I also had the salmon cakes. Cooked well, crust was good, flavor good. The remoulade sauce is spicy, but that's where all the flavor is! I tried my sis' yams. Those were good!  The cornbread was OK despite all the rave. My sis said it taste like jiffy. I agree that there wasn't anything special about them. Like Emeril says, \"kick it up a notch.\" That hmph was missing about them. Dessert - banana pudding was very good but could have used more wafers. Red velvet cake was tasty - perfect moisture and flavor.  Service - the servers were good and gave great recommendations. They keep pitchers of drinks near the patio door which is a lil odd.  Overall great spot I would visit again."}
{"text":"Excellent southern food, they welcome you with free cornbread that is delicious.  Skip catfish, pork chop and BBQ.  Go straight to the buttermilk fried chicken strips - amazing.  For sides, the black eyed peas and collard greens are excellent.  You will need a nap after lunch here."}
{"text":"Let's say someone has been traveling for work a lot. Let's say they end up in Charlotte, NC. Then let's say that they LOVE food especially anything that can be described as \"Southern\" and they happen to stay next to Mert's. Then we'd say...heaven.  DELICIOUS corn bread. (Seriously, the stuff melts in your mouth...amazing). I got the blackened salmon with okra & tomatoes and collard greens as the sides, sweet tea (the only way tea should be, IMO) and a Blue Moon. We also got a plate of \"soul rolls\" for the table which black-eyed peas, collard greens, rice and chicken and some sort of honey mustard sauce. Can I say hell yeah? Basically a delicious meal that I scarfed down in .5 seconds because I'd been working all day.   Eat up, NC! Or, if you're not in NC...get there immediately and go to Mert's."}
{"text":"I love chicken and don't love ribs but I can say they have the best chicken and there ribs made me love ribs and the best thing were there collard greens they had a explosion of flavor I from Maryland and if i come back to Charlotte I'll  eat here everyday."}
{"text":"I dropped in early on a Saturday morning for their brunch, and Mert's indeed definitely has heart and soul. Everyone was really busy and happy, even at 9AM. The service is great, the food is fairly priced, and the \"advertisement\" appeal does not entirely overwhelm the experience.  The brunch fare did not sound particularly appetizing, since eggs are not my favorite dish. I went with a vegetable plate of home fries, yams, collards, and mac and cheese. Best decision possible. $7? Crazy.  With your meal, they bring out their famous cornbread. It is super moist and crumbly on the inside, and it is served piping hot. There is a touch of crunchy crust on the outside; awesome.  The macaroni and cheese has some awesome gooey crust mixed in throughout the large scoop. The collards have onions and tomatoes for a fresh taste. The home fries are a bit different than hash browns: soft and heavily seasoned. The yams have a bit too much sauce; they were a bit too sticky, though nice and creamy.  I also tried a sweet potato pancake. It was slightly bland, but I liked the fluffy texture and little bits of crispness along the ring.  Mert's is quite the institution in Charlotte, so I am sure that it is split between locals and tourists. No matter how touristy it gets, I am certain that it is going to stay for a long time. The service, food, and price make it a great dining experience. It is different, but just as enjoyable as eating your soul food in a Southern diner with grease on the walls."}
{"text":"Fried pork chops, why did you taste so good?  I had already had too much fried food...but you were too delicious to not be eaten.  The worst part of the meal was when the waitress came over, while I was gnawing on the bone, and took away my plate, where there was an ungnawed on bone still sitting there.  Delicious memories, yet so bittersweet."}
{"text":"After all the great reviews I decided I must give this place a try. I went on a Friday afternoon with my parents for a bite to eat. I always dread going uptown because I am not quite familiar with the parking there yet. Luckily it wasn't to busy at the time so we were able to find a spot at a meter up front.   First thought was wow this place is tiny. The ambience is casual and the staff there are really friendly.   My favorite part the food. They bring out individual cornbread loaf's with a honey butter after you place your order. I must say it was great I ate mines and half of my mother's. I honestly would go just for the cornbread. Then we got the rest of our meals I ordered a chicken wing plate with red beans and rice with gravey. The chicken was flavorless tasted like flour. The WORST fried chicken ever. I expected so much more I mean I had to pour hot sauce all over just to eat it. The beans and rice were not much better. My dad ordered the special of fried turkey with stuffing gravy with mac and cheese and yams on the side. He did not enjoy his either and he is alot easier to please than I am. My mom had a fried shrimp po' boy with mac and cheese. She said she liked the mac and cheese it had a sweet taste to it.  Dessert we split a slice of German Chocolate cake. It was pretty good. They have a wonderful array of desserts to try."}
{"text":"Had the Shrimp Po Boo.  I wish I know that it would be spicy I would have asked them to hold the spice.  Even the Home Fries where spicy.  I understand that it's southern home cooking, however other items on the menu warn that it's spicy.  I understand it's not a four star restaurant, however the batter on the popcorn shrimp could have more crispy.  Perhaps the fryer was not to temperature when they sunk them.  Despite the spiciness of the potatoes they where fresh and not cooked that long, although personally I do like crispy home fries.  Having said that portion was good size, price average with other restaurants in the area.  Service was my biggest issue.  While the waitress did keep checking back to see if we where ready to order, however she never asked if I would like another Ice Tea.  I needed usually needed to wait and attempt to attract her attention."}
{"text":"Visited with a group of friends on a Friday evening. This was my first meal Uptown since I first moved to Charlotte two months ago. I ended up getting the chicken tender meal with collards and mac, all of which was just okay. The tenders were small and a bit dry. I probably should have known better and gone with a different protein. Collards were a bit under seasoned. Mac was standard. The real star of the meal was the cornbread.   I will go back and try a few other things. Restaurant has cool atmosphere and service was on point. Plus, the location is really convenient to the square and the transit center. Not a bad option at all."}
{"text":"I had a very nice brunch here the other day on a weekend trip to Charlotte. The food was very good but the service was ehh. The interior was interesting. I could have easily been in an Ikea on LSD.   We ordered eggs over easy with country ham, grits and a biscuit. As well as a bunch of sides (mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, collard greens, catfish, cornbread). The country ham was wayyy too salty but mix it up with the grits and you're back in business. Things that were excellent: the cornbread, the biscuit, and the mashed potatoes. The catfish was ok, it didn't really taste like anything but frying oil.   The service was pretty weak. Our waitress forgot to put our side order of catfish in...I know it sounds absurd.. who orders a side of catfish? Anyway, she forgot it and brought us a full catfish meal at the end of our meal which we didn't turn away 'cause it just wasn't worth the trouble. And to top it off she added an extra omelet to our bill. I usually don't check each line item on my bill but I could tell the waitress was a bit of a basket case and was right.   I'll be back here the next time I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"People in charlotte rave about mert's, so we had to try it.  It's just ok in my opinion.  I had a combo platter when I came: beef ribs, fried catfish, collards, and Mac and cheese.  The beef ribs were not quite what I was expecting or really would have ordered if I had known.  They were the short kind - and in this case, emphasis on short.  There was very little meat on them. The BBQ sauce was too vinegary for my tastes, just ok.  The catfish was solid, but again, when I was eating it I still didn't understand the hype.  The collards were the best part of the meal (delicious take on a classic), and the Mac and cheese was good too, though under seasoned.   My partner had the salmon cakes, which were very good.  I don't remember what else she had, but this aspect was memorable and quite good.  We both had cake for dessert, which again were good but not outstanding.  The atmosphere is cool here. I like the bright colors and the VERY friendly and courteous wait staff.  You can tell they want their customers to be happy, but the food just wasn't that great, so I can't go above 3 stars for now.  We may try mert's again, so we'll see."}
{"text":"had no problem with the street parking.  service was prompted, courteous, and great.  food is yummy, portion is large.  price's right.  will come back!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my experience at Mert's. Having a soul food restaurant in Uptown really shows the variety of options. Again, with friends we visited and the place was packed. It's not the largest restaurant, but it has lots of charm. The place had photos all over the wall and some interesting art too. I was mostly taken by the counter of cakes. They had at least 10 on the counter for you to choose from. I picked out the cake I wanted before I ordered my food. I had the fried catfish, black eyed peas, cole slaw and macaroni and cheese. I enjoyed everything except the macaroni and cheese. I also had cornbread, which was great. I had to stop eating it before my food came out or I would have been full. Ok, the best part of it all was the Banana Pudding Cake. Initially, I wanted the Banana Pudding, but they were out, so the next best thing is Banana Pudding Cake. It was highly recommended from our waitress and it didn't disappoint. It's a must try. All the cakes looked delicious. The food is reasonably priced too. The restaurant is in the city, so parking is available in different lots or garages and you can walk. Overall, I enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"One extra star for service. As for the food, I have definitely had better. Fried Chicken was decent, but the pulled pork had a little too much fat in it (at lease 1/3 was chunks of fat), I can only take so much. Squash salad, candied sweet potato, and okra & tomato sides were decent. The sweet potato cake with cream cheese frosting was excellent but might be too rich and sweet for some."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Mert's quite a few times over the years, but this was my first visit in a while.  I'm glad to say that things are as good as ever!  I had the salmon cakes, which were absolutely fantastic. Very fresh, well seasoned and tasty. I loved the slightly spicy remoulade that is provided for the extra kick. All entrees come with cornbread, and it does not disappoint. It makes for a nice starter as you await your meal.  For my sides, I had the acorn squash and the potato salad- both were magnificent. I had to try the acorn squash because it was such a unique thing to find on a menu. I hope this is done as a special side on a regular basis. It was so tender that I even ate the skin! The potato salad should satisfy any fans of the traditional southern variety.   Service was friendly and efficient and the price was certainly reasonable.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Um...I walked in there and walked right back out. I will never ever eat there.Their Health Inspection score is an 84...f*cking disgusting  their inspection history: 84 93 90 93 94 90 94 87.5 91  Gross. They're obviously not keen on keeping a clean restaurant.  If you're the type of person that says, \"oh I don't look at that kind of stuff\"...you should. You REALLY should."}
{"text":"I WILL NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN! This was my second time eating here and while the food is not terrible, it's not the best and is way overprice for mediocre. First time I had fried chicken and I honestly can say that Bojangles is by far better. This time I had the shrimp creole and rice and it was not bad but doesn't stand out. The rice was bland and the dish over all had no spice. If you have a party over 4 eating here, forget it because they only have seating for 4 and no good accommodations for larger parties. I had a party of 6 this time and it took OVER AN HOUR for us to be seated. I had visiting family and they tried to sit us at separate tables?? NOT GOOD ENOUGH MERTS! Now the part that any restaurant should have is good customer service and today, their host was extremely poor, rude and had a major attitude problem! This is unacceptable for ANY RESTAURANT! My recommendation is to go elsewhere and save yourself the trouble!"}
{"text":"Food is crazy good. It was like I was back at my grandmothers house. And the service was great they definitely know how to take care of you. A must go is you are looking for soul food"}
{"text":"Had dinner last night here. The food left a lot to be desired. Reputation aside the salmon cakes had no seasoning and the ribeye was tough. Really disappointing. I've been here before when I come to Charlotte and had better food. Hopefully, this was a one-off."}
{"text":"Pretty good soul food at decent prices. The service was eh. It was not busy during our visit.  The fried chicken and chicken wings were was ok, not as crisp as I like. The green beans were very good.  We waited forever, almost walked out before we received a waitress. Mac n cheese was good.  The food was reasonably priced and I would return and give them another shot."}
{"text":"I came last Saturday on a whim. I had been passing this place on my walks around the area. Seeing all those people buzzing in there enticed me. It didn't take long to be seated, considering how many people were in there. I ordered fried chicken ( breast and wing), macaroni and cheese, and red beans with a lemonade. Mistakenly, they brought wings and I immediately alerted the waitress. Then, I received my order. Everything except for the red beans was scrumptious. For dessert, I selected German chocolate cake. It was not extravagantly delicious but nice. Next time, I'll get for my sides macaroni and cheese with potato salad, then finish with yellow cake and chocolate icing."}
{"text":"We have a ton of soul food places in the DMV, none with the customer service as high as Mert's. Although it was a rainy day when we went, we were immediately seated and greeted upon our initial walk in. I heard about Mert's through one of those food network shows I typically watch which review various markets around the United States. I called in advanced and inquired about the wait time and the receptionist kindly said come on in....there is no wait at the current moment. According to the tv show and the reviews posted the soul rolls are a must try. I will not argue that point at all. As most have noted the food is really good but it's not big mamas house but if your craving down home cooking Mert's will do.....when the bill came it was $70 bucks for 4 people with appetizers and take home desserts. In DC this woulda ran me over $100 bucks so I gladly paid this with no complaint. Thanks Mert's for not charging for lemonade refills like some souls food places feel their entitled to do...the only suggestions and reason I could not give this place 5 stars is it did not have a changing table for my mini me which made for a rather interesting duper change lol...peep the pic, I will come again, hopefully my kids in pull-ups by then lol"}
{"text":"Delicious!  We were looking for a quick spot for dinner and wanted something local to Uptown Charlotte - and we almost passed on this because we didn't know how long the food would take - but so glad we went! Really good southern soul food (I got fried catfish, yams, and collards).  Fantastic atmosphere - decorations and vibe are great.  Quick service! And the cornbread they brought out for free before our meal was really yummy. If you're visiting the area - def stop here!"}
{"text":"I tired this place because people raved about their food. So I finally decide to try their food on Sunday. When we arrived the hostess was very unpleasant. She told us that the wait was going to be 45 minutes, which was odd because they had three tables that needed to be cleaned and only two people ahead of us. When we were seated the waitress was sweat at first. She explained to us that the catfish wasn't her favorite but the chicken was ok. (It's great when your staff really doesn't have that much to rave on). When our food arrived, my collard greens had tomatoes and onions. I had asked for the collards to be plain. I told the young guy that my order was incorrect. He huffed and took my plate away. The person I was with, asked the server for gravy. We asked someone in the restaurant to bring us gravy because our server was no where to be found. As we asked him for the gravy, he asked us to move our purses so that he could use one of the inside chairs.......Are you serious. 20 minutes later, the server came back and said, \"Oh, he never brought it?\" After that she never came back to check on us, until it was time for us to pay. I would never go back to this place. The service was terrible and the food was not all that great."}
{"text":"I have lived in Charlotte for awhile and never visited Mert's. I purchased a Groupon. Today was first and last visit. They try to pass the cornbread off as homemade. It's not. The collard greens were tough and salty and the blackened salmon was greasy. Plus the waitress was rude. Nobody in my lunch party enjoyed their meal."}
{"text":"Amazing meal. I got the beef rib and fried chicken which were both outstanding. For sides I got the collard greens and cabbage, also great. And to top it off, the cornbread was delicious! Great service too!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. They cornbread really is all that.  I came here with a friend and ordered the salmoncake as an appetizer, catfish, okra and slaw.  Since I feel that my entree was only a bit above average I'd rate this 3 stars.  For a soul food place this I would definitely come back for the salmon cake and cornbread.  I enjoyed my food and the portions. The waitstaff was helpful and very friendly.  It was an overall pleasant place to have dinner."}
{"text":"I had high expectations considering that I was in the South.  I love the food in the South!  However the experience here was not very good!    I grew up eating most of the food on the menu, and I tend to make strong comparisons against that home cooking.  In addition, I love food, and I have a wide taste bud ranging from various regions of the world.  The food was delivered to me at my table very very very very very hot.  I was unable to comfortably eat for approx. 7 to 10 minutes.   I ordered Fried Chicken, Greens, Yams, Catfish, and Banana Pudding.  The previous day, my business colleague order and ate the red beans and rice.  Service was good.  The menu needs help.  1) The Fried Chicken wasn't really fried.  It looked like baked chicken that was dried out.  Not crispy looking, not seasoned. Not very tasty. 2) The Catfish was a complete fish with bones.  The taste was pretty good! However, I would have enjoyed it more had I not had to de-bone every bite. 3) The Greens were good! 4) Yams were good! 5) Corn bread was just ok 6) Banana Pudding was very good! 7) Red beans rice and sausage was not good.  All and all, the Merts was just ok,  However, if in town again, I would not be compelled to re-visit...and I love Soul Food."}
{"text":"If your having a taste for soul food this a place to go. I've been here a few times and the food has never disappointed me. For the price point their portions are well off, enough for me to finish the rest the next day.  I recommend the fried chicken, catfish, yams and mac-n-cheese. I have always gone during slower to times so I've had quick service. The servers here are down to earth and tentative, but if you come here it's just for good food and laughs in my eyes. Be sure to visit this place at least once."}
{"text":"Always have a good experience whenever I go. I try no to go when there is large crowds because service can get light due to being overwhelmed. The food is always on point. I do like there side of collard greens with the fried Chicken or fried fish. The Carrot cake is really good."}
{"text":"This place was quick and good. We needed a quick place to eat before going to the bc music factory so stopped here being on tv food maps. The server was nice and very quick service. Not to mention was pretty cheap. I normally don't know cornbread but here it's awesome! Just a little sweetness to it. We also got the fried green tomatoes, I liked them because I prefer restaurants that use cornmeal and they did, I suggest to ask for some extra sauce they drizzle on top. If it friend chicken, mashed potatoes with gravy and Mac and cheese. Overall pretty standard soul food, to be honest it was good but wasn't the best I've ever had for all three items. The chicken was a large portion and the gravy could have used a little more flavor. Overall pretty good for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"If you want to get no service go sit outside. Food is deep fried so not for everyone."}
{"text":"This is a great gem in our city. It's uptown in the heart of Charlotte. I wouldn't bring a party of 10 because it's not that large on the inside, or if you do I would call ahead to find out if they're busy at the time or not. It's kind of earthy on the inside as far as the walls and floors. The menu is definitely southern inspired. It's a mixture of \"the south\" & creole. I had the blackened salmon with rice and greens beans. I absolutely loved everything! My friends had the macaroni and cheese and it was the next best thing to your mother's. The Cornbread is buttermilk made...not hot water! The bread will fill you early so eat it last if you can. The only con is the tip is included in your bill. Our waitress wasn't as attentive as she should have been. She would get your request and walk away before you could finish with something else. I guess since the tip is included she didn't care, but she still had a great attitude. Maybe she was overwhelmed. Nevertheless you will enjoy your food!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty cramped, and not a 4 star restaurant by any means...basic menu...I got the chicken breast and collard greens and sweet potatoes. ..the best part of the meal was the cornbread. My chicken was dry, with a lack of seasoning and my greens tasted greasy..like someone didn't drain the fat off of them or something. ..not the best place to get soul food in my opinion."}
{"text":"Okay, the food is pretty good especially their sides but the I ordered the catfish and it was pretty bland which is a bummer. Our server forgot my meal and never bought it back but the good thing was I ended up getting my meal comped since my meal didn't come until we got our checks--I was with a large group so I'm sure they were just off a little. My favorite sides are the candies yams, cabbage, and the Mac and cheese!!"}
{"text":"Yes the salmon cakes are definitely a attraction and the fried chicken is da bomb! I took my girl there and she can cook and even she was excited about this food I just called her and we are going there to nite she jumped at the chance of returning to this heavenly mecca of culinary delights wow and the Greens and all the sides wow baked Mac and cheese to die for !!! The meatloaf is better than moms shhh don't tell mom!¡! And the place is cool a lot of soulful singers record albums on the wall and a lot of eclectic all da wall stuff on the walls not fancy dress just right with a mixed crowd of cool people and just ask your waitperson why the foods so good and they just beam you owe it to yourself to go experience this soul food mecca of culinary delights...."}
{"text":"Not as good as I expected. We were instantly seated and ordered our food. It took a long time to get the food and the wrong things came out. We waited forever for the correct items. And then waited forever again for the server to return...then forever once more to pay/get cards back.  The food was average. Nothing special."}
{"text":"I miss Mert's. Well, I guess I miss good southern food in general, and, to me, Mert's is why. Granted, I love my Bojangles, Cookout, various BBQ joints, calabash and all. But, whenever I head back to Charlotte, I make it a point to hit up Mert's at least once, if not three times.   I usually get the fried catfish with mashed potatoes and collard greens. The catfish is fried to perfection, nice and crisp without being overly oily or heavy, and the cooks make sure to leave the fins and tail on for those customers that really know how to eat fish. The mashed are made from real potatoes, and the collards are very flavorful, kissed with just the right amount of vinegar. And of course, I always gotta have a loaf or two of the absolute best cornbread in the world. There's a reason why the above is listed as my last meal on earth, and given the portions, I may just be able to delay that inevitable end by a good half hour. The portions are HUGE!  There's nothing on the menu I wouldn't try. There are some definite \"safe\" items, especially for breakfast. But, if you're just starting your southern cooking career, the fried chicken is excellent as are the shrimp and grits, which aren't really my cup of tea, although that sweet tea now... Service is good, warm and friendly just like service usually is everywhere in the South. There might be a wait at lunch, but given the good weather in Charlotte, you can usually grab a seat on the sidewalk pretty quick.   I'm sure there are better, more authentic spots for southern food. But, for visitors to Charlotte, or those looking for something a little more chic, and sitll new to Southern cooking outside of KFC, a stop at Mert's is absolutely mandatory."}
{"text":"I thought I'd avoid the crowd by dining a little late but the place was PACKED! I love the look and feel of the restaurant although it was a bit warm inside. I asked for a table outside and had my pick...probably a little chilly for some but just right for me.   Sweet tea and a corn bread CAKE were brought out right away. It was the size of a small pound cake and I knew I was in for trouble! I ordered the salmon cakes, greens and mac & cheese. Salmon cakes had lost their crispness on the outside, but the flavor was delicious. The greens were leafy and large and JUST RIGHT! And god bless the mac & cheese. Oozing with buttery cheesy goodness and a touch of the topping that had baked up brown and I may as well have died and gone to heaven.  Of course I could not finish all the food. But my server offered a box without my asking. Great food and great service."}
{"text":"I'm good!  When you have a veggie section on the menu and indicate what is cooked with animal fat(1 item), that's a big plus for me. All the meat eaters seemed to be pleased with portions and seasonings.   Oh!  I had collared greens, red beans, okra an tomatoes with cornbread on the side. Good stuff.    Customers walked in until close and were being served. Last observation; a lot clean plates. Veggie and meat eaters with find something grub on. Check it out when in Charlotte. Peace"}
{"text":"If you don't know anything about soul food, it tastes good. If you've had real home cooked soul food and are looking to replicate the experience, this is not the place to go. On the contrary, the staff was friendly and approachable."}
{"text":"I went to the Epicenter in Uptown Charlotte today for the first time. Looking to have a nice lunch, I was unimpressed with the options within the complex. A quick search on Yelp turned up Mert's. Southern soul food sounded fantastic!  I didn't leave disappointed. We were able to quickly get a table during lunch hour. I thought the service was exceptional, even though one of my items were wrong, but it was handled well.  My favorite part had to be getting a huge piece of corn bread while waiting for the meal. The fried chicken leg quarter I had was definitely top notch. The fried catfish fillet needed more seasoning, but the Cajun tartar sauce made up for that. My sides of mashed potatoes and mac/cheese were alright.  I'd definitely say a 4/5 meal, 5/5 service, and 4/5 prices. Try this place out if you're near the Epicenter, only a 4 minute walk!"}
{"text":"Great interior.  Visited on a Thursday night.  Original server, who took our orders, seemed great, but was quickly replaced by a second server who seemed rather surly.  Order details were not passed along - such as a request for lettuce, tomato, and mayo my sandwich.  Then, instead of coming to the table to pick up our credit cards for payment, she wanted us to pass them to her while she stood at the register next to the table ~smh~ Much too informal with that.    BBQ was great.  Mac and cheese pretty good."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of taking a coworker to Mert's for her first time today. We had an amazing lunch! The place was packed but we didn't have to wait. The waitresses were super busy with big parties who were there for their Sunday afternoon meals but were no less charming and friendly.  I've been once before and I highly recommend the Fried Green Tomato appetizer that I had last time. The chicken is excellent as is the cornbread. I had Salmon Cakes today and they were out of this world! The mac and cheese is delicious as are the greens and green beans. I could have drank a gallon of their sweet tea but I'm glad I stuck with two. We shared a piece of German Chocolate Cake for dessert. I was good and the whipped cream on the side just melted in my mouth.  I don't know why I waited so long to make a return visit but trust me, I'm going to make it a priority to get back there soon!"}
{"text":"Mert's is AWESOME. Now I might be biased because I LOVE southern cookin, but this place does it right!!!  Their cornbread is the best I've had anywhere.  No lie.  And their fried chicken blows Price's Chicken Coop out of the water.  Check out the menu before you go and if you like the type of food they serve, you're going to love Mert's."}
{"text":"For southern comfort food, you can't go wrong. My favorite is the Andouille sausage beans and rice. The homemade cornbread is great as well. This has been around for a long time so they must be doing something right!"}
{"text":"Was excited to go here after having been recommended it by one of the locals and also due to it being on DD&D.  Our server was very nice and friendly and the best part of this place.   Our brunch took 25-30 minutes to come out during non-busy hours. A very long wait just for breakfast food.  The food itself was not special. Nothing stood out. My girlfriend ordered a fried chicken dish and honestly Bojangles is better and it's cheaper and fast food.  It's also pretty dirty and the bathroom is disgusting.   Save your money and go somewhere else. I have no idea how this place made it on DD&D."}
{"text":"It gets points for not being a chain, because Charlotte has turned into a city of chains. Honestly, overall the food was terribly bland. It is a decent spot to check out for soul food, but not my number one recommendation. I will say that the cornbread was phenomenal, like best ever level cornbread, but that was where the meal deliciousness ended. My chicken just tasted like fryer grease and was extremely greasy and more burnt than crisp (everyone else at the table that got the fried chicken felt the same). The yams were over the top sweet, more like a dessert and swimming in sauce and the collards really didn't have any taste at all, and were at the point of over cooked. I will say that our server was wonderful and very pleasant, which helped the dining experience. Overall, I'm glad we checked out this place, but I don't think we will be back."}
{"text":"After seeing Mert's featured on the Food Network, I was super excited about visiting this place while visiting Charlotte. I arrived on a Saturday during lunch hour and was seated within 10 minutes. Our server was not friendly nor attentive the entire time but she did have a few parties in addition to my table of 2. It took about 20 minutes before we even got our drinks. By the time she was ready to take our order, we decided to put our entire order in all at the same time so our entrees came well before our appetizers. Once we were ready to go, it took about 15 minutes for our check to be delivered. I know the place was busy but they really need to improve on their customer service.   Now for the take on food. Let me preference that I'm from the South and grew up eating and cooking Soul/Southern food my entire life so I may be a little bias.  Appetizers We ordered the Soul Rolls which were amazing. Black eyed peas, collard greens, chicken and rice egg roll style. They are unique and very tasty.  They also give you complementary cornbread which is pretty good. I think they must use sour cream with the mix because it had a more tangy flavor.    Entrees My boyfriend ordered Shrimp and Grits. He enjoyed the dish but definitely has had better. The Roux was very bland and the grits were a little overcooked.  I ordered the Fried catfish plate with macaroni & cheese and collard greens. My catfish was good but both my sides lacked flavor. The macaroni & cheese tasted like off brand cheese mixed with heavy butter.  My collard greens was way too salty. I've had better greens from a can of Glory.  Overall - I think a must try is the Soul Rolls for sure. All the other food seems very commercial and lacks flavor. And you must be willing to overlook the horrible service as well."}
{"text":"This place serves excellent Low Country/Country Cooking dishes at reasonable prices - at least the prices are reasonable at lunch, $7 - $9 for a entree which comes with 2 sides and corn bread.  The Fried Chicken is excellent, The Ribs are as well, and I love the Salmon Cakes. The Fried Catfish is good, any of the Po' Boys are worth trying. The Fried Green Tomato app is nice, not as tart as some, but still good. The Collards are not to my liking, and  I've tried them twice.  The Shrimp and Grits are nice, rich and creamy. But, I was disappointed in the Shrimp Creole, was bland and watery. Service here is excellent, even when this place is busy, which it always seems to be. The ambiance is homey, though it can get a little loud."}
{"text":"I visited Charlotte last week and I ate here three times.  I couldn't help it.    Soul Food is right.  Eating here is like having a spiritual revival meeting in your mouth.  You feel like a better person after having eaten here.  A better person who will die of a massive heart attack in 5 minutes."}
{"text":"Amazing soul food in the heart of downtown Charlotte.  Fun atmosphere, warm and hospitable service. Generous portions. Everything was fantastic."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time when I visited charlotte last year. Fast forward and I'm back again a year later. Had a vibe that the food portions got a bit smaller since, or just unlucky night? Who knows.   Service was a bit slow when I went in Friday night and our food was sitting out for like 5-10 mins before it was actually brought out to us. Just gonna go ahead and call it an unlucky night, food was delicious tho."}
{"text":"This is my second visit to Mert's (the first time Yelp wouldn't let me be great and check in). They decor is artisy and eclectic and includes a diner style dessert counter. (My inner fatty girl rejoices) if you are on one of those \"starve myself of carbs because they are the devil\" diets do yourself a favor and skip this place because the cornbread is a MUST!   I got the fried jumbo chicken wings which were delicious, the greens, which were flavorful but not very juicy like I prefer mine. The only disappointment from my meal were my yams. Basically because I had more juice than potato :-(   Staff was friendly and attentive. I'll definitely be returning for some banana pudding."}
{"text":"The service here sucks. We went there and they got us the main meal before the appetizer and bread.  When I requested to have my appetizer first, the waitress replied that they are expecting lots of people from the convention and they are trying to get us out as fast as possible. I immediately left.   Never going to go back again."}
{"text":"Best soul food in Charlotte. Other than the clogged arteries, nothing to complain about. The cornbread is amazing by the way, probably the most memorable part of my meal."}
{"text":"Wow. This place is excellent!  I grew up in Charlotte and sadly, never discovered this place until after I moved away. I heard a couple of great recommendations, and my family decided to try it out.   The meal starts out with some outstanding cornbread, so buttery it seems light and almost melts in your mouth. We also got a fried green tomato appetizer, which was really good. Between the four of us we had 2 orders of salmon cakes (delish), fried chicken, and ribs, and probably one of each of the sides. I would definitely recommend the salmon cakes again, fried chicken and ribs are a bit heavy for me but my dad and brother went to town. Everything was really good and made me lament living so far away from good southern cookin'.  Then there was dessert. While my mom, brother and I were unbuttoning the top button of our pants and trying to make a little bit more room, my dad was going strong. We ended up with a slice of sweet potato cake (divine!) and a slice of coconut cake to take home for later. The waitress told us that all of the cakes are made by a woman in her home, and we could just imagine what her house must smell like...   Our server was super friendly and comfortable; she was really nice but not in the kind of way where she was trying too hard.   Love love loved it. I will look forward to coming back on each visit home!"}
{"text":"Super friendly service and very quick! Food was good (i had the southern sampler). Cornbread was A+ I just wish the ventilation was a little better inside, but if you don't mind smelling like fried food, then all around, this place is wonderful!! :-)"}
{"text":"Well, I was disappointed. I read a few mixed reviews before visiting this restaurant, which came highly recommended from my sister. This seems to be a \"hit or miss\" establishment. I had beef ribs, Mac & cheese, and collard greens. The BBQ sauce on the beef ribs was rather unique, not to my liking. The collard greens were disgusting. They are vinegar based. They aren't chopped up so I essentially had a bowl of vinegar based collard leaves. The fried chicken while plain was the best part of my meal with a little Texas Pete added.   I ordered the salmon patties as an appetizer. They were highly recommended. They were heavily peppered and was another dish not tailored to my liking.   It took about 30+ minutes to receive our food. Unfortunately, this will be my first and last time visiting this establishment.   (My sister would like me to note that this was a visit at night, allegedly there food is better before dusk)"}
{"text":"Let me first say how delicious the cornbread was!  The catfish that I  ordered was a fillet with a lot of batter on it although it was seasoned nice it was just to much breading for me ( and i thought i was going to get the whole fish not the fillet). The yams were out of a can so that was a major let down. The mac and cheese was not to my liking at all it tasted like it was made with velvetta and other cheap cheeses.The fried chicken was lightly fried and not crispy either but the collard greens were well seasoned.  Seems like a tourist spot to me. The staff was friendly and I liked the crowd I didn't get a chance to try the homemade cakes although they looked pretty tasty.  I can at least say that I tried this place :)"}
{"text":"Stopped at Merts on the recommendation of a client while visiting Charlotte. The food was pretty good, though not nearly as good as soul food I've had in other places. The collard greens were very good, but the fried chicken was a bit dry. I didn't come in with high expectations so I wasn't extremely let down, but I've definitely had better sold food at other  places."}
{"text":"Collard Greens were some of the best I've had.  Fried chicken was yummy, but the quarter (breast & wing) was too big to pick up and eat with my fingers.  Doing the knife & fork thing took some of the joy out of having my way with this guilty pleasure.  Homey  comfort food in a warm, friendly environment."}
{"text":"We came on a Thursday evening and ordered the fried chicken breast with BBQ beef ribs, 2 sides: mac and cheese and mashed potatoes and a heineken for 20  - Come b4 8 to beat the wait! - Friendly waitress. Gave great recommendations.  - Excellent cornbread...so goood! nom nom!  - Average chicken. It's no Roscoe's. EllaEm's in LV is better. crispy juicy fail.  - A bone with no meat on my plate. rib fail. - Beef was not as tender as I would have hoped for. No mind-blowing flavor - Ordered a side of home fries but it was pending even after I finished my meal! lol - Home fries are not fries. It's more like chopped potatoes. Good thing I cancelled my order - Expensive heineken. Just get a Carolina."}
{"text":"Loved our waitresses!  They were fun and personal with attitude!  Food was so so. The BBQ ribs were small beef short ribs with a thin vinegar based sauce.  The Mac n cheese was the best!  The collard greens were hard and vinegar based.  The peach cobbler was just so so.  Atmosphere ans waitresses are the best part of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Not a fan of anything here. I have tried the food here on several occassions and just dont see how people keep going there. Soul food with no soul.... thats my take on it."}
{"text":"Went to Merts on Saturday for the first time and wasn't to enthused. I have a heart for fried chicken but it was just ok. Great customer service but ok on the food."}
{"text":"I am definitely a fan - it is quirky, eclectic, and fun to visit, although it is a bit on the smaller side. The soul rolls are pretty much everything, and their fried chicken/mac and cheese is delicious. It is incredibly affordable, and there are just enough options without being overwhelming. One of my favorite casual dining establishments."}
{"text":"Went to Mert's on Friday and was absolutely dying to try their Salmon Cakes! Needless to say I did Not get to. It was a group of 3 and we opted to sit outside since it was comfortable. We were sat at the first outdoor table and the gentleman left after seating us. We looked over the menu and had all decided on what we wanted. We waited 32 minutes and still not a single person employed by Mert's bothered to ask us about a drink let alone any type of service.  I was beyond put off by this and thought it to be very unprofessional!  They were Not that busy at all. There were plenty of waiters and waitresses standing around talking and even the gentleman that sat us was just sitting down gabbing with another employee.  We will NEVER go back again. As a small family owned business like Mert's you strive for customer satisfaction,  I know this all too well. As a small business owner myself I continuously look to support other small businesses but obviously my standards are far exceeding that of Mert's standards. Such a shame."}
{"text":"My mother and I decided to check this place out one afternoon in Charlotte. Please don't waste your time, money, and patience visiting this establishment! The service is absolutely dreadful and the food is mediocre at best!"}
{"text":"Had the chicken wings with okra and mac and cheese....my friend was right when he said the food was overrated. Completely bland wings and mac and cheese was pretty much cheese-less except the top. However, the okra was good and so was the cornbread. Not worth the money though."}
{"text":"The worst customer service by server and manager. We've been coming here for years. Tonight's experience is one of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had. Supposedly there was a computer error with our food. Fine, I understand it happens sometimes. However while waiting two hours, we repeatedly asked our server about our dinner. We got the same response every time. \"It'll be right up.\" He did not consider actually checking on the food. All the tables around us came, ate and left. Meanwhile, our server could not even remember to bring water to the table without being asked multiple times.   After I stopped asking nicely about our food, the server finally went to inquire. The manager offered to comp two beers for waiting two hours if we wanted to just  leave. How generous. Otherwise she offered to discount our meals and offered us what we thought was another round of beers. She did not even follow through on that promise. We were given one free beer each. Pathetic. Over 80% of the restaurant was filled with people from our convention. People who make it a point to dine here every time we come.   The server never apologized. Nor did he bother to even clear our plates.  There are plenty of other places to spend your money where it will be appreciated."}
{"text":"Portions were huge. Corn bread was one the best I have had. Sweet tea was good, just right. Server was very polite and responsive. Had fried chicken,  macn cheese and collards. All needed more flavor."}
{"text":"Where to begin...  Even the bread and butter served to each table is utterly delicious! Located conveniently in the downtown, Uptown, the restaurant exuded southern hospitality. The smell of fried everything wafted from the kitchen. Sign posters on the walls showed pretty much every stage actor ever had stopped in. And the staff was friendly as could be.  As for the food, there was absolutely nothing that feel short of expectations. Fried tomatoes, mmm mmm mmm! Green beans cooked in delicious country ham juices. Fried Chicken, salivating good!  Our waitress kept emphasizing desserts. We went ahead and got some strawberry shortcake, a sweet explosion of flavor later, we exited satisfied, with smiles on our faces, and about 5 pounds heavier."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at Mert's restaurant and I enjoyed the food.  My sister and I live in the beautiful city of Charlotte and we decided to go on a brother-sister date at Merts!  I ordered the southern fried chicken with Mac and cheese and cabbage. My sister ordered blackened pork chop with Okra & tomatoes and Mac and cheese.... MmmMmmmmMmmm... Finger sucking delicious!!!  I'll be back with some co-workers. I was looking for a good soul food restaurant in Charlotte for a while and I found it!"}
{"text":"Came here because of Yelp with my boss. Soul rolls for an appetizer were delicious. Corn bread was awesome! Short ribs were perfect and red beans were too. He had Salmon cakes  okra and collard greens with tomatoes. Now  a soul food devotee ! A must in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Oh wow. I came for brunch and made the mistake of not ordering one of their signature soul food dishes. The chicken n dumplings looked amazing, and the fried chicken was outstanding.  Now don't get me wrong, my meat lover omelet was a perfect balance of very pronounced flavors, but there are unique offerings that should be tried if you never have before. The cornbread? Wow.  The biscuits?  Yum.  Sweet tea? But of course. And don't even get me started on the multitude of fresh cobblers and cakes available by the slice... Plus, Bruce Bruce and Anthony Hamilton frequent this place. And if its good enough for Bruce Bruce, its good enough for me. And a friend."}
{"text":"No doubt am I fan. Whether this LBD is craving mac and cheese or collard greens, I know where to go.  I usually order online on \"uptown2go\", so I know to give it about 20 minutes before collecting my meal. Lately, I have been a huge fan of their bbq sandwich. It comes on top of a buttered roll. Now if that doesn't get it poppin, what does?  Being a northern boy, I never really had the opportunity to munch out on some soul food. Let me tell you, this place has gotten me addicted to collard greens.   They also have good beans and cornbread. And when I want some beans and cornbread, I will go to Mert's for some beans and cornbread. If it wasn't for their beans and cornbread, I'd go somewhere else for my beans and cornbread.  LBD Scale- Easy 8. Now doubt in my mind that this place is a trademark southern soul food boutique. If there's any other places that you recommend, holla at me. But right this second, I'm all about Mert's. I WANT SOME MERT'S IN MY MOUTH!"}
{"text":"Sophisticated soul food but great.  Ambiance is classic with a downtown location.  I got the fried chicken, patatoe salad (not traditional but very good) and the collard greens are spectacular with a twist (a little onion and tomatoe on top)."}
{"text":"I went to Mert's for lunch based off the reviews here and recommendations from coworkers.  I wasn't disappointed.  Mert's has an atmosphere that is trying to look like a dive diner, but comfortable and clean as well.  The atmosphere works well here.   I ordered the jumbo chicken wings with greens and mac-n-cheese as my sides.  The chicken wings were big and fried crispy, the greens were very tasty as was the mac-n-cheese.  The cornbread has to be some of the best I have ever had.  The greeens and mac-n-cheese were not the best I have ever had, but they were right up towards the top of my list.  The place was fairly busy as I expected and the service was OK.  I recieved my drink and food promptly, but my server never checked back.  I never really needed anything so I didn't suffer, but I can't give 5 stars because of that.  If you like good home cooked goodness then Mert's is the place to go."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed the cornbread, but my other two companions thought it could have been sweeter.  I ordered salmon cakes, Mac and cheese, and green beens. The greenbeans were over cooked, but the mac and cheese was amazing! The salmon cakes were a little better than ok, I've had better though. Overall I was very stuffed at the end of my meal.  My friend has the soft shell crab po boy with greens and loved it! The greens were cooked perfectly-not overdone.  My wife had the whiting dinner with greens and yams, and loved the fish! She said that the yams had a weird taste-like they added vanilla or something.  From a service perspective, our waitress seemed a bit overwhelmed. She had so many tables! She was moving the best that she could, damn near running.   Overall, my experience was just ok, but nothing memorable. Although nothing was awful, I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"This was my second visit, the first time I really enjoyed the meal and service. However this last visit will probably be my last. The waitress seem to dislike her job, no smiles she wasn't friendly at all. It was like I was asking for a favor when I asked for a refill on my drink. I came in with my family, and they actually enjoyed their food(fried chicken wings and sides). I wasn't so lucky, I ordered fried pork chop with a side of macaroni and cheese and seasoned rice. The pork chops were very salty and oily, the grease was pouring out each time I cut the meat. I was also give burnt Mac and cheese, I don't mind having my cheese a little burnt but not my pasta. I think Merts is one of those hit or miss type restaurants. It's unfortunate because I love soul food but I would rather cook before I spend money on burnt food with snotty service. What I did enjoy was the cake. Whom ever made the lemon cake hands were touched by God."}
{"text":"I had the blackened salmon, collard greens and yams. The collard greens were cooked  perfectly and the yams were delicious. Blackened salmon was a little overlooked and under seasoned."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT SOUL FOOD!  The fried chicken, Salmon and fried catfish were off the chain!    Service was great...  and all the food including desserts were fresh and home-made!  I left stuffed...  Feeling like I had just spent an afternoon at my sister Gloria's house on Sunday!"}
{"text":"I was in town for business, and this \"landmark\" restaurant was about a block from my hotel. Seeing as a large portion of Charlotte's Uptown restaurants are closed on Sunday, I decided to go against my initial judgment and give this tourist trap a try.  Unfortunately, my instinct was right. The whole meal was off. I ordered the chicken tender plate with green beans and mashed potatoes. The green beans were too sweet, and the mashed potatoes were so under seasoned that they tasted like a pile of mush. I was happy when I saw the chicken tenders once they're hand breaded in house -- that was until I was on my last chicken tender, and it was a piece of fried fish.... This carelessness by the kitchen staff is unacceptable.  The saving grace was the dessert. They have a great cake display, and the cakes are absolutely delicious. The cakes are the only items that reminded me of good ole Southern cooking."}
{"text":"I liked the atmosphere as it was casual and laid back. The service was friendly and courteous too. The prices were reasonable for a place to eat in Uptown that is not a chain. And I like eating at places that are independently owned small businesses. But the food left me only half impressed.   I had the Southern Fried Chicken Breast with Collard Greens and Black Eyed Peas. Unfortunately the Collard Greens was all that I was impressed with. It tasted amazing and topping them with freshly diced onions and tomatoes were a nice touch. But the Fried Chicken and Black Eyed Peas were just EH~. I expected the Fried Chicken to have more flavor. But it didn't. It also tasted too dry and not moist at all. I also expected the Black Eyed Peas to have more flavor or richness to them since they are usually made with bacon or ham hock. But it didn't. And the only thing good about the cornbread, in my opinion, was the honey butter that it came with.   Now I do have to admit it was my first time eating here. And I'm sure there are probably other items on the menu I would have enjoyed just as much as the Collard Greens. But with any restaurant I go to, first impressions matter. My theory is with any good restaurant their entire menu is good no matter what you order, which is what makes me want to go back, make it a favorite destination, and want to keep going back to try EVERYTHING. But I'm going to have to think twice about this place since there was some hits and misses, which is a shame b/c I do love soul food."}
{"text":"I love this. Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. I love how the inside isn't modern but outdated instead; shows some history to the place and a sense of trust. I always get there yams and mac n cheese; soo good. I have had the catfish and whiting, both great."}
{"text":"We went here with some friends after an event. They couldn't believe we hadn't heard of it. Soul Food, sounds good to me! The portions were huge, our waiter was exceptionally nice and patient. Super sweet guy! We all tried different things... the mac was just ok, but the chicken was great. Fried chicken isn't something I usually get, but the fried chicken wings (no sauce on them) were killer. It's such a cool unusual place to visit - you feel like you stepped back in time. I enjoyed it for something new to try."}
{"text":"I really wanted to get grub at Price's, but they don't have a dining area and I didn't want to get take out.  Came here for lunch.  Waitresses was pushing hard on the chicken tenders that she loved.  Free cornbread was average.   I had the fried chicken and sides of mashed potatoes and mac n' cheese.  Surprisingly, none of it was really that good.  Service was cheerful though.  I guess the best part was I was able to park in downtown Charlotte, found a free spot, and wasn't towed when I was done eating here."}
{"text":"Not sure about heart and soul but it was definitely a solid meal.  One thing I really like about this place is the artwork and decor.  They also have outdoor seating on the sidewalk.  I got the beef ribs and dark meat chicken.  Yes it's a lot of food assholes.  And yes I finished it (most of it) but this is 2 hours after having a breakfast buffet at the hotel.  Sides were delish.  I got the yams and okra/tomatoes."}
{"text":"Omg! I came across this place while googling somewhere to eat after a Hornets Game and what a delightful surprise! This is an authentic Southern Restaurant! The atmosphere is extremely comforting and mellow. Our server Jerry was the greatest! He was knowledgeable and very nice. Every suggestion he made was a winner! My girlfriend and I enjoyed whiting,fried chicken  mac and cheese , potato salad, and shrimp and grits , peach cobbler and German chocolate cake !! Everything was cooked to perfection and well seasoned! The true definition of southern cooking and hospitality! A must go to!!"}
{"text":"My group of four was seated immediately after walking in, and we were completely done with our entire meal in 25 minutes. We ordered and received our food within 5 minutes of each other. I ordered the southern fried chicken breast with sides of macaroni & cheese and mashed potatoes. The food was incredible! Quality soul food. The restaurant itself is pretty small, but it adds to the overall feel of the place. The atmosphere is very intimate and southern with a home-y feel that everyone can enjoy. I had an incredible experience here and I wish I lived closer so I could come here all the time!!"}
{"text":"Great food. The full menu isn't available during CIAA weekend. They only offer a special shortened menu. It's not a problem at all because its super packed in here. The staff  is pretty nice. They can't be too attentive because of how busy they are. It is CIAA weekend so that's understandable."}
{"text":"Insane. Nirvana. Green beans, mac & cheese, cornbread, braised short rib, fried chicken, fish po boy for $28. absolute nails. place is real deal."}
{"text":"I had the veggie plate and they have such pleasant spicy kick in them! Cornbread is just perfect."}
{"text":"Last year I remembered that this place had a line out the door. We waited last year and we waited this year too. Why? Because Mert's is worth it!   We were lined up outside for about 20 minutes this time, but found entertainment in a street hustle, where some character asks to see if you have a 100 dollar bill and if so he invites you to bet it by guessing which of 3 bottle caps has a red pill underneath. I was so glad to get in when we did, really not trying to get caught up in a street brawl just in case both that red pill and main man's 100 dollar bill disappeared all at once.   So we're seated. I ordered a sweet tea, collard greens, mac n cheese, fried catfish, and BBQ beef riblets. Sounds like alot, but the portions are equivalent to a plate of food at a cook out. Nonetheless I was stuffed! The collard greens are excellent, you can taste a little vinegar and they top them with tomato and onion if you don't protest. I enjoyed everything, mac n cheese thick n cheesy, ribs-tender sauce -sweet, the catfish was good n crisp, however I like a slightly spicier batter. But other than that, two thumbs up!!   The surroundings are pleasant, you see lots of young people laughing and having fun, and proud accomplished HBCU alumni telling their stories around the table! An American dream, the culture here is so rich. This place is worthy of a visit from one of those Food Network Road Scholars for sure! Totally SATISFYING; where else can 5 grown ups eat for $80? If yall don't know you better ask somebody :0) Mert's is all that!"}
{"text":"Ok, just to dispel any misunderstandings, this isn't true \"soul food\" - it's great southern cooking.  We have been here three times since living in Charlotte and continue to come back for more. The mac-and-cheese is to die for, and every entree we've had has been terrific. I usually get the fried chicken tenders but opted for the barbecue ribs last time I was here, and was not disappointed. The cornbread is a huge plus but is usually too much for me to finish. Shrimp and Grits is an all-time favorite for me as well. If you can, save room for dessert. If they have it, the german chocolate cake is a total win.  Go for al fresco dining if you can (weather permitting) - nothing like sitting outside and watching the sites of Uptown Charlotte."}
{"text":"Sorry Mert's...just two stars...and I do feel bad. Soul Food is an all time fave for me and I left feeling real let down. Without a doubt, the cornbread is out of this world. But everything else was just 'meh' to me.   I'd actually classify the offerings here more on the cuisine level, than down home comfort food. Down home comfort food is what I was looking for, and sadly I didn't get it at all. I hate to say it but flavor was missing in most of what I tasted. The egg roll appetizers filled with black eyed peas and greens, would have been a total fail had it not been for the dipping sauce. I found the main dish of red beans and rice to be totally lacking in flavor and overall taste appeal. Same went for the collard greens..bland-O.   The restaurant felt good and looked good. The food looked good, but didn't taste good. The service was top notch. Honestly, I'll probably give it another shot in the event it was just an off night."}
{"text":"Came here after they were bookmarked for years on Valentine's Day with a colleague. Now the food wasn't bad to me but it wasn't my taste.   The cornbread mini loaf that was served as an appetizer was delicious! I ordered the catfish with sides of macaroni and cheese, collard greens, and mashed potatoes. I prefer my catfish fried on the harder side and it was served fried a little soft; it became mushy. The collard greens were vinegar based... they were not awful by any means but I have never cared for vinegar based collard greens.   There are a TON of other reviews so I won't go on and on. Due to my personal preferences of liking sweet collards versus bitter and catfish fried hard, my meal wasn't that enjoyable. I'm definitely glad that I did check it out for the experience."}
{"text":"The most southern style food and restaurant you can find in Charlotte. Fried catfish was good but their chicken was average.   When I first started working in Charlotte, three months ago, everyone raved about Mert's. So as a \"New York city-slicker\" I got dragged by my coworkers to try \"southern cookin\".   Nothing super about the food, but the sides are amazing. Mmmmmm cornbread"}
{"text":"Best fried chicken I have ever had.  Looking for good southern, soul food?  You have come to the right place!  Their cornbread alone could keep them in business.  Wait staff is friendly and attentive.  Greens, Mac n cheese, fried fish.... all delicious."}
{"text":"The family and I went here over the weekend after a long day at the Strawberry Festival. I had been wanting to eat here for years, especially after seeing them on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives. I'm such a foodie so I love trying new places.  Hate that we had to pay to park, but that's the downside to eating somewhere in the city. It was a beautiful night and we got to eat out front. Food was GREAT. Service, not so much. We were seated before another table, and they were greeted and brought drinks out to. I had to get up after about 10 minutes of sitting there and ask if we had a server. The hostess said our server was busy so she'd take our drink order. Right after that, he came over to our table and got our order.  First, they bring out the cornbread. Omg! Best freakin cornbread I've ever had in my life!! It was so moist and just absolutely delicious. I ordered fried chicken, bbq beef ribs, mac n cheese, and green beans. The fried chicken was a little disappointing as I anticipated it to have more flavor than it did. It was kind of bland. The ribs were decent, a little too fatty but that is to be expected. Mac n cheese was off the chain. Green beans were just that, nothing special. My son had green beans, mac n cheese, and homefries. He didn't care for the homefries cause they were more like sautéed potatoes and he prefers fries. My husband had the shrimp po'boy and homefries. He said his was good.  Our drinks stayed empty for the most part so service needs to be better. We left an 18% tip (he's lucky he got that), and the server picked the receipt up before we left and had an ugly look on his face like we didn't leave enough. Sorry, next time you should pay more attention to your tables. They weren't that busy. There were plenty of empty tables.   All in all, it was a nice family dinner in the city. Wasn't even too expensive (about the price you'd pay at Chili's). Not sure we'll be back, but it was a good experience."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Merts a few times and even received a free birthday meal which included a drink. Very impressed. My favorite dishes are the salmon cakes and the rice and beans with turkey sausage but that dish tends to be too salty at times. Overall, nice place to eat."}
{"text":"This is a great place. It is a little pricey, but we enjoyed the food! The service was just ok, not great. We will definitely go back when we are in Charlotte again."}
{"text":"The service was good but idk what the hype is about this place... food is gross! Not good southern food! No seasoning on the food what so ever and our corn bread wasn't done I've been twice and haven't had a good experience. My shrimp and grits was soup literally"}
{"text":"This spot is a must go to whenever I'm in Charlotte. The mac&cheese is sooo good. And i just had the soft crab po boy and it was awesome!!! Shrimp and grits are a favorite though i must admit they weren't as good this time as the last, but still good nonetheless."}
{"text":"Best soul food I've ever eaten. I love this place sooo much!!! It's always packed no matter what time I'm there. Food comes out fast and very hot. If I could eat there every day, I would! Best salmon cakes around."}
{"text":"First time for 6 of us.   Enjoyed the shrimp and grits, salmon cakes and the cornbread. The cornbread was killer as was the potato cake. Apparently the secret to the cornbread is honey and mayonnaise. They are worth the trip themselves.   Fried chicken was crispy and Moist. Collard greens were great. Candied yams and coleslaw were not good.   Service was great. Server shaniq was very fun and pleasant, however Hostess was not as friendly.   Atmoshpere was definitely a greasy spoon, diner style. Don't have the craving to go back"}
{"text":"Serviceable food. I'm not sure how authentic this is and seems geared to Uptown tourists. Had red beans and rice with turkey sausage. Really needed a kick. Hate to say this but the red beans and rice is tastier at Popeyes Chicken. My side of collard greens was just ok...but my okra and tomatoes side was tasty. Best part of dinner was the sweet potato cake!  Service was good and atmosphere was pleasant. Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Man, I've had this place bookmarked almost since I first found Yelp in Charlotte. I've just never had an opportunity to eat here until I had some friends staying in Uptown and they wanted a \"Charlotte meal\". So here's to Mert's and one less bookmark!  Classic Southern soul food. Collard greens and fried okra and fried chicken and sausage gravy and all those yummy things that just put weight on when you mention their names! I was tempted by so much but when the waiter mentioned their specials, I knew that the grilled pork chop in white gravy was for me. And it was. Excellent and tasty with lots of flavor and spice, I cleaned the plate and then picked up the bone for chewing. Great stuff. For sides, I had the mac & cheese (excellent!) and the yams (only meh).  For dessert, the peach cobbler was only okay - an overwheming spiciness. I think that I might have just gotten a bad scoop, because my friend who had it really liked his. The vanilla ice cream gave it the right consistency, but the flavor wasn't right.  Street parking only, but it's barely a stone's throw from the LYNX Station so consider taking the train!"}
{"text":"Excellent experience all around.  - Service was great.  Friendly, warm and this is why I love visiting the South. - Food was excellent.   Someone told me that the cornbread was out of this world.  Yup it is.   We had the fried chicken (cooked to perfection), collards, yams and my favorite was the mac and cheese.  Sweet tea was amazing. - The play some nice music while you're eating and it's just a fun spot."}
{"text":"Amazing food, never disappointed!! If your going to the spectrum center be sure to hit this place up!  Cornbread is on another level and you better bring your appetite, always leave stuffed!!"}
{"text":"The food is good but the waiters are money hungry only ppl they want to wait on are ppl they think they will get a Big tip from ,,. Sad  aka old white ppl , black ppl have money too"}
{"text":"Southern soul food...what else is there!?! Everything sounds good, but went for the day special..braised pork steak with white wine sauce with my choice of 2 sides..Greens done right and okra with tomatoes...yum yum yum.  Meals come with a mini cornbread loaf and honey butter..OMG tasty!!  Didn't have room to try one of several delicious looking cakes under domes    I will definitely be back when in CLT!!"}
{"text":"Had the BBQ beef ribs, fried catfish with the 2 sides and corn bread. My two sides were potato salad and yams. The sides were GREAT. So was the corn bread. The beef ribs were not FULL ribs. The ribs were like riblets. It was only bone. We complained and our server looked out. We were upset that the riblets were so small and it doesn't say riblets on the menu. It says BBQ RIBS. Other than that, the food was amazing even the riblets."}
{"text":"Best place in charlotte to get a taste of  southern food..we had fried chicken, salmon cakes, collard greens , beans , corn bread, mac and cheese ..everything was amazing.."}
{"text":"Charlotte is an odd city. It appears as if North Carolina needed a place to conduct financial business and girls, wearing the tightest/shortest skirts I have ever seen, needed a place to congregate. Men wearing colorful polo shirts, short pleated shorts and Italian loafers with no socks needed a place to make money and look for the short skirt women.   The whole city shuts down Saturday and Sunday except for bars and restaurants during the PM hours. Finding a good breakfast place seemed like a daunting task until we found Mert's.  This cozy soul food joint had tons of character and a solid menu. When we walked in, the smell of fried chicken and greens slam you in the face. There were two pots large enough to bath William Howard Taft slowly cooking collard greens on the stove in the back. The griddle was loaded up with bacon and pancakes. Just a beautiful sight.   I ordered eggs and country ham with home fries and a biscuit. The biscuit was so good i almost ordered another. Instead, i just ate most of my wife's. I also got a pan cake on the side. I honestly dont remember eating a better pancake in years. Lastly, i ordered fried green tomatoes. Very well done. Batter was a little hard but all in all, very good. Also, the tomatoes taste like they spent some time in the fridge.  My wife got the sweet potato pan cakes as well as fried chicken and eggs. The fried chicken was shockingly good. I could have gone back that night to eat more.  The only down side was all the eggs served to our table were under cooked. When i order over easy, i expect to have all the white cooked with a runny yolk. We all ordered over easy and there was a lot of uncooked egg white in everyone's eggs. There is a simple fix for this: order over medium!  Coffee was nice a strong. Syrup was hot. Hot sauce was already on the table. Real butter was served."}
{"text":"Would've loved to have tried your food but I stood at the front for 10 minutes and no one greeted me. Maybe next time?"}
{"text":"This place is really good.  The staff was great, food fresh, and a great menu.    I will always return whenever in Downtown."}
{"text":"never had anything from here that wasnt absolutely delish! fried chicken is outstanding, like grandma made it. salmon cakes and cornbread, some of the best ive ever had. greens are so good. mac and cheese rivals my grandmothers recipe. banana pudding and sweet potato cake are my favorite desserts here, but honestly you can get anything and you cant go wrong. dont forget to try the soul rolls as an appetizer. so good!! i love this place. i took my family that lives in hawaii here and my bro said that this might be his favorite place to eat anywhere. its one of my favorites too :)"}
{"text":"The place is extremely over-rated.  I have been there multiple times and after this last visit I will never spend my money there again. After being sat we were ignored for a good 10-15 minutes, meanwhile we got water spilled on us and still no service.  We then had to get up and ask someone to serve us.  Their greens are lacking flavor and are somewhat toothy.  Their \"famous\" shrimp and grits are mediocre at best.  The po-boy was a huge piece of bread with literally 5 shrimp on it for almost 12 bucks, and came about 7 minutes after everyone else's food (supposedly they were \"adding more shrimp\" LMAO!) Their cornbread is legit though, I will give them that.  Sadly good cornbread isn't enough to make up for their lack of caring, it shows in their food and service.  Guy Fieri's taste buds are seriously off, the bleach is getting to his brain.  Adios Merts."}
{"text":"We've been living in Charlotte for a year now, and we've been to quite a few restaurants in our time. However, while I have found that perfect BBQ joint I dreamed of, I had not yet happened across the quintessential place for good ol' Southern cooking...in particular fried chicken. Well, that is now a thing of the past, for I have found Merts.  You could tell just from walking inside that it was going to be a great Southern food experience. The interior of the restaurant is colorful and eye-catching, and the art and decor screams Southern. The interior was full to capacity, but we were able to snag a table outside. The outdoor area is a mixed bag. While it's nowhere near as crowded as inside (with only four tables or so) the Charlotte pedestrians take it upon themselves to walk through the outdoor area. It was a bit disruptive to be eating a nice meal while people constantly walked right against your table.   I wasn't a fan of the beer list since Merts does not carry any drafts, so I stuck with unsweet tea. After placing our orders the server came over with a small loaf of cornbread for each of us. This cornbread was spot on for me! Not gritty, a little sweet and extremely crumbly. You could tell it was fresh from the oven, and that made it super awesome!  For dinner I ordered the beef ribs and leg quarter fried chicken combo. I wasn't crazy about the ribs themselves, as they were a bit tough and chunks of bone kept flaking off. I did enjoy the sauce, as it was a sweet and tangy sauce and not vinegary. Now the chicken was THE BOMB! I've been searching for fried chicken down here, and have been disappointed time and again. So far I am confident to say that Merts has the best fried chicken (though I haven't made it over to Price's yet, so don't jump on me for that yet.) The battered skin was light and crisp, and not greasy. The interior was that moist and juicy you expect from fried chicken. I was in heaven scoffing that chicken down, and I wish I had more right now!   The miss' ordered the catfish and fried chicken breast combo, and that was also pretty dang awesome. The catfish was a huge filet just plopped on the plate. The meat came right off and was so light and tasty. The batter was also perfect, with not too much that didn't take away from the soft flavor of the fish. They serve it with this spicy sauce that was a good compliment to the fish. The chicken breast was just as good as my leg. Even the white meat stayed juicy and tender! The miss' didn't eat too much of it after filling up on the fish, so there are plenty of chicken leftovers in my future!  The other thing that Merts does damn good is sides. One problem I've had at BBQ and other places down here is that the meats are perfect, yet the sides are extremely lacking. Merts has some of the best dang sides money can buy. We both ordered the mac & cheese and it was simply the best I've had down here. Some places I've been to make it watery or oily or just not flavored right, but Merts had it all. It was a firm consistency with a great cheesy flavor, and the cheese crust on top was awesome. I also tried black eyed peas for the first time and loved them. They were cooked perfectly and were served in this kind of gravy that was also tasty. The miss' ordered the collard greens and I have to say that I liked those too. I'm generally not a fan of collards as they are bitter, but these were cooked in such a way that the bitterness was taken down a notch or two. They had some citrus flavoring to them that helped tone it down and added a different level of flavor to. All in all, the sides kicked butt! Unfortunately we were so stuffed from this massive meal that we did not stick around for dessert.  I have to say, when I think home cooked Southern fare, I will always associate it with Merts. They can fry up some mean chicken and fish, and their sides and veggies are top notch. It's a busy place but it is definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"We've had the pleasure of experiencing Mert's dine in and takeout. I must say, I definitely recommend dine in over takeout. The quality of the entree is very inconsistent. We tried takeout first, I got the salmon salmon cake entree while the bf ordered the fried chicken plate. We got the mac and cheese, red bean, and mashed potato side. It took FOREVER TO PICK UP, and we even arrived 15 minutes after they said it was ready. I was waiting at the cashier stand for another 15-20 minutes. Upon arriving back home, I was sad to find that my salmon cakes were not as large or fluffy as depicted on the groupon picture or the dine in pictures on Yelp. They tasted great tho, the remoulade was flavorful and paired well for this meal. The mac and cheese was our favorite side, followed by the creamy mashed potatoes (made out of red potatoes for a twist). The red beans didn't have that much flavor. However, the sides were not as large as I had hoped. The cornbread was sooo good! I read on the website the moisture comes from some mayo  added to the mix. Overall good quality, I just expected more food, it didn't even cover half of the tin takeout tray that it was served in.   Fast forward to last week, this time we got the dine in groupon. Luckily, not nearly as crowded as it was the first time I walked in. I ordered the exact same thing while the bf got a chicken po boy and some home fries. This time, the salmon patties were a good size but, did not taste as good as the takeout I had earlier. It almost seemed as if it were canned tune, did not have the consistency of a home cooked patty...unless it spent an hour in the food processor. The sides were good as before. The bf's po boy was huge and stuffed with fresh chicken tenders. I thought it needed some more remoulade, it was a little dry but, tasty and hearty.   I want to come back here again, but it is a hit or a miss. I would stick to dine in if I were you. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Walked in and was warmly greeted.  Exceptional customer service by an amazing young lady.  The food was quick and great.  Nice clean restaurant that is reasonably priced.  Overall phenomenal experience.  Highly recommend this spot for all visitors."}
{"text":"Oh man. When people talk about legit southern food, I will think of this place fondly. I will actually probably think of it and drool.   I ordered the special turkey dinner, with greens and Mac n' cheese. I didn't even realize the turkey had stuffing in it! Both were incredible! I also absolutely loved the greens and Mac. Honestly, I wish I had a bottomless stomach so I could have eaten it all. One thing's for sure, and it's that you will not leave hungry!"}
{"text":"The food really is some of the best soul food I've ever had. I tried some of everyone's sides and each was legit. I had the special, spicy ribs with green beans and rice, and I licked my plate clean"}
{"text":"Did you ever feel like you've been catfished by a restaurant? Not in the good way, where you eat some delicious catfish, but where the online photos and experience are NOTHING like what you encounter in person? This restaurant embodies that experience so perfectly I'm surprised they aren't claiming they're a model or a rapper that just needs to borrow a few hundred dollars.   Ambience: Casual, with a regular serving of insects. I can understand the flies since there was an oddly placed lamp beside us, but I also had to kill a silverfish on the menu, a tiny roach at the end of dinner and some random bug that crawled on my cleavage at the end of dinner. If I had seen the roach earlier in the night I could have avoided this catastrophe.  Drinks: Insultingly subpar. If your mimosas have as much alcohol as a glass of Kool aid then you need to start over. You can buy better champagne from a 7-11 if they sell it in your state.  Food: Dreadful. We got the soul food sampler so we could try everything, in addition to the shrimp Creole and a side of mac and cheese. The salmon cakes were okay, that's the nicest thing I can say about them. The wings had zero seasoning- the best thing I can say about them is they weren't raw. The soul roll was an abomination of grease and tastelessness, and should be removed from the menu immediately. The mac and cheese tasted more sad than a kindergartner's Kraft cheese and macaroni. There were no curds or any indication that any skill was involved here. I assume this was the cook's first time in the kitchen- it was a 1 cheese crime against soul food. It earned a solid F. The shrimp Creole there's no excuse for. OPEN A BOX OF ZATARAIN'S IF YOU CARE THIS LITTLE.  Staff: Lovely! The only bright spot in an otherwise demoralizing evening out. She was a sweetheart and deserved every penny of the tip she got. I'm serious, she was great!   Overall: Just go to McDonald's and get their breakfast menu items. As a person who easily skips McDs for years at a time this is saying a lot. But if you're yearning for terrible food you should at least save money while you're at it.  RUN!"}
{"text":"Highly, highly overrated! I'm from Louisiana, so I'm a tough critic. I ordered Blackened Pork Chops and it was just okay. Also, we smelled like a grease kitchen for the rest of the day. Best advice is to dine outside! Best piece of lunch was the cornbread."}
{"text":"Mert's was an interesting introduction to soul food.  We ordered sweet tea, salmon cakes with collard greens and black-eyed peas, fried chicken (dark) with collard greens and rice and fried catfish with okra and steamed cabbage.    Before all the food came out, the plate of 3 hot and piping corn breads were served with butter.  Very fresh, right out of the oven.  Don't eat too much of this corn bread or you won't be able to finish your meal.  The salmon cakes came with a spicy aioli - very tasty salmon cakes and I like the aioli.    The fried chicken was darn good!  The fried catfish - even better!  No fishy smell.  Just fresh catfish with that nice spicy aioli.  Collard Greens, Black-Eyed Peas, Okra, Steamed Cabbage - all good!  No room for dessert after lunch but I understand that there's 13 varieties of cake to choose from!"}
{"text":"Chopped pork, corn bread, soul roll, blacked chop Delicious.  Agree greens a bit stemy but still good. Strawberry cake fair banana pudding eh. I'd go back!"}
{"text":"The best fried catfish filets I've ever had. Also got the yams (unbelievably good) and creamy cole slaw. All that and 5-star cornbread. Must have been 2 inches thick and light as a feather. This was truly phenomenal home cooking. I told the boss she could charge 2-3 times the price in San Antonio and pack the dining room."}
{"text":"I came to Charlotte on a mini vacation for a week. People around the area were raving about this place called Mert's.  I decided to check out this place for dinner. When I walked in, I felt like I was at home.   Everything felt laid back and homey. I didn't know what to order so I decided to ask the waitress. She gave me a couple recommendations and I decided to go with the combo which came with BBQ Beef Rib, Fried Chicken, and two sides. I ordered the Mac & Cheese and home fries. Blue Moon was only $3.50 so we decided to grab couple beers.  While we waited for our food our waitress came to our table with some corn bread and sweet butter. This is probably the best cornbread I ever had!!! It was sweet and delicious!!! When my food came the Fried Chicken looked dry and not very appealing. I bite into the chicken and was amazed! The chicken was juicy, tender, and not that greasy! The beef ribs were just as satisfying!  The mac & cheese and mash potatoes were both great.   I would definitely recommend this place. The atmosphere was relaxing and I felt like I was at home. Waitress provided excellent service and was conversing with us throughout the night. Lastly, the combo with the two sides cost me $14! If you are near downtown Charlotte, you must check this place out and order the FRIED CHICKEN & BBQ RIBS!"}
{"text":"Heard great things before going here, so I was glad to get one of those half off deals that we could go try it.  We were greeted nicely by a young lady at the desk who offered to seat us in the half empty restaurant (it was about 7:45pm on a Wednesday) directly under the flat screen TV that was blaring so loudly that we could not have heard each other.  We asked if we could be seated away from the TV but were only offered two tables, both of which were only one away from the one under the TV and there were others available further away.      We were greeted by a server that we thought was ours who asked for our drink order and he promptly got those for us and disappeared.  After several minutes, the young lady who seated us eventually came to the table and said she was our server.  She told us the specials of the night and then said unless we wanted to put in an order for an appetizer, she would be back after she put in two other orders.  It took her another 5-8 minutes to return and take our order.        Thankfully, the food didn't take as long as the ordering process did, but the server was was a bit short with me when she seemed unsure as to which plate went to whom.  After our food came, she was mostly unavailable, never offered to refill drinks, and when our 12 year old politely asked for her assistance as she passed by, she said she would be right back but didn't return for another 8 minutes or so.  The restaurant was not incredibly busy and there were 3 other servers, one of whom was on a laptop at the bar for at least 30 min. and then stood watching the TV instead of helping other servers or checking on tables.        As for the food:  Cornbread = one the best I've had.  I'm NC native.  Lived here all my life...I know cornbread.  Our youngest got the yams and a BBQ pork sandwich, both of which were very tasty...especially the pork.  Our oldest got the chicken fingers, home fries and macaroni and cheese.  He loved the mac...ordered more.  Home fries were more like potato wedges tossed with spices.  Flavor was ok, but the potatoes were dry and unimpressive.  He enjoyed the chicken fingers but didn't rave about them.  I got a veggie plate with mashed potatoes, collard greens, black-eyed peas, and a salad.  The salad consisted on one red onion slice, one cucumber slice and shredded mixed greens.  The honey mustard dressing seemed like a bottled one, though it tasted ok.  This served on a small saucer.  The black-eyed peas were good properly, but a bit bland.  The mashed potatoes were flecked with bit of the skins and had good flavor overall, but nothing exceptional.  The collards were the real star; salty, tender green goodness.  My husband got the red beans which he said were just okay, He also got the house fries, which he didn't care for, and the collards (he liked, but says his mom makes better...true,) the seasoned rice (meh) and the salad.  Nothing memorable.      We probably will not return mostly based on the inattentive service and hit or miss food.   ."}
{"text":"Definitely hidden. They serve good brunch on the weekends and you won't wait in a ridiculous line full of degenerates.   Make sure to get their biscuits."}
{"text":"Okay. So I don't see the hoopla about this place.  We had salmon cakes, I had the pork chops, okra, and the green beans. My dish was pretty simple in taste. My friend on the hand, had the backend catfish, mac and cheese,  and the cabbage. Ideally her dish would've been my choice but I decided to live vicariously through her. The breading on the  fish had a lot of pepper, yet the fish it self was bland. The Mac and cheese was dry and obviously reheated more than once :(  Our server was pleasant,  but she annoyed the crap out of  me when not once but twice decided to inform us that \"in the south  they throw pepper over the shoulder into a dish.\"  The food has a lot pepper in it bc the cook decided to add a lot of pepper--the end!  Also, pls. do not insult your customers bc you recognize a NY accent.  I will not be going there nor will I be recommending anyone to visit."}
{"text":"We loves us some soul food and Mert's never disappoints! When we are in Charlotte it is a fun and filling place to visit. The cornbread is what every other piece of cornbread aspires to be.... The mac and cheese is rich and filling..... The fried chicken is crispy outside, tender inside... True comfort food."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Mert's. I got the catfish and shrimp Creole with a side of collard greens and mac & cheese. Everything was extremely tasty and Darlene, my waitress, was wonderful."}
{"text":"The fried chicken is crispy and damn good. The mac and cheese is appropriately mac-y and cheesy. The chicken tenders are everything you want them to be (on a salad they're almost healthy*). The slaw is chopped until it's almost pureed, and it's freshness cuts through all that grease. And believe me, I'm happy as a pig in shit** sitting outside listening to the Beverly Hills Cop theme song, shaking Texas Pete onto a quarter chicken with a Carolina Blonde to cool me down.  But I would give all that up if it didn't include the cornbread.   These tall, warm, individual mini-loaves are the fluffiest, moistest pieces of cornbread I've ever encountered, and with the slab of whipped, sweet butter melting slowly into the golden sides...I would come back just for this cornbread and nothing else.   But if I HAVE to order the fried chicken to get it, I'll bite that bullet.  _____________  *Not true. **Never said that before, but it seems appropriate here."}
{"text":"Southern plates made in the south by a chef who was raised on this food specifically? You see it in every detail.   The jumbo chicken wings, salmon cakes, cornbread, macaroni and cheese, potato salad and okra was absolutely to die for. Food came out faster than I could have ever imagined. Seriously, about 3 minutes after we ordered. Piping hot, full of flavor and delivered by an over-the-top waiter with a smile.  Refills came quickly and our time in Charlotte will always be remembered thanks to Mert's. The hostess was a tad rude, which started everything off a little odd, but everything rebounded from that. Still 5 stars.  If you want a hearty dinner for an extremely small price tag, go here. You can personally message me and thank me after. I wouldn't be upset."}
{"text":"Charlotte is my favorite city, small but has all I need and more....We had to wait a bit, but it was worth it to say the least! Waiter and staff very friendly and professional, seated after about 15min wait. Our food was hot and delicious, the cornbread starter was hot and drooling good! I will be back for sure, to try another dish. Pic loaded of our meal...  Atmosphere was very pleasing, presentation of the food was excellent. Offering something for the whole family. My husband and I enjoyed our meal. The restaurant was both clean and tidy, having plenty seating.Staff members there greeted us in/ out when we left.  This is a must try when U are in Charlotte, if U want some southern cuisine with love on top!!  Make sure U try the yummy Soul rolls!!"}
{"text":"I was in town and my mom wanted to come here due to the great things she has heard about this place! I double checked on my trusty Yelp app (as usual) and the reviews here were favorable.  We arrived during lunch hour on a weekday, and it was a nice day so we decided to sit outside. The place is not that big, but the restaurant is full of character inside.  I ordered Chicken Wings as an appetizer... ummm that was definitely a given! For my main course, I ordered Mert's Famous Salmon Cakes with Mac and Cheese and Green Beans as the fixins. My mom had Fried Catfish, along with Collard Greens and some other fixin I can't remember.   So let me dish on my dishes. The Chicken Wings were delivered nice and hot, crispy but lacking in flavor. The Salmon Cakes had a decent presentation, did not have a strong fishy taste, but they were super salty, I couldn't finish more than a few bites. The macaroni and cheese... well it was mostly cheese and not much macaroni. I think they gave me the top layer. The green beans were delicious. They were well seasoned and flavorful. I left  And service was lacking as well... the server was friendly, but service was slow and it was not that busy... my water stayed empty and we waited a little too long for the check. It was like we were outside and forgotten *sad face*, so I had to ask another waitress to find our server to bring us the check.  So overall, I was super disappointed with our lunch at Mert's. We were underwhelmed and the food was overpriced. I'm from Charlotte so I know of many other places to find great soul food, so I probably won't return.  Note: If you do decide to try this place on your own, check Groupon or Living Social as I saw them listed on one of these services so you can get a good deal on your meal."}
{"text":"Wow! So glad I found this place. Took mom and dad here to give them their first taste of soul food and they cleaned the plate. Honesty, there was not one crumb of cornbread left. We ordered and shared the fried chicken and bbq ribs. The meat just fell off the bone. Yum. Had collards and macncheese for sides. Oh, they ordered the sweet potato pudding but we all thought it was too sweet. Overall, great place for dinner. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good.. I probably won't come back because it took so long for me to get my food to go. But it was a nice experience. Does not taste like mamas cooking or grandmas.. But a lot of my friends love this place."}
{"text":"This restaurant is my favorite restaurant in Uptown. I first visited this restaurant before I moved to Charlotte. I was walking Uptown one day and decided to give them a try. Once I saw that they served soul food, that was it for me. For one reason it is very hard to find restaurants nowadays that are homey and laid back. It feels like home when you walk in the door. You've gotta be crazy to not like the place. They serve everything from fried chicken, corn bread (with each meal), BBQ beef ribs (since I don't eat pork , that was definitely a winner for me), and lamb chops. My favorite sides are their mac & cheese, collard greens and sweet potatoes. At first taste, I thought I had died and gone to heaven. I felt like I was in my Mother's kitchen again. The food is great, the staff is great and I would recommend it to anyone. Out of all the times I've gone, there was only once that I was a little displeased with what I had ordered."}
{"text":"I have no idea how this place has so many good reviews. Maybe we went on an off night or something but there wasn't anything left ( no fish, no salmon cakes, no Mac & cheese, no mashed potatoes, etc.) and the chick failed to mention that until we were actually trying to order our food. They only had  chicken, pork chops, ribs and greens left for the most part. The chicken looked like it was good, I ordered the pork chop and that thing was cooked beyond repair. I felt like I was chewing meat flavored rubberbands. My fiance had ribs that were mostly fat and gristle. The greens were under seasoned and undercooked (and why were they garnished with raw tomatoes??). I mean, we went in there with such high hopes and were so disappointed. I'm gonna just assume that we came on an off night and I may give it another try cause I wanna try those salmon cakes everyone raves about, but I'm skeptical.   On another note, the cornbread was DELICIOUS. We were pretty  living off of that until it was time to go..."}
{"text":"Mert's is one of those places you would see on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. The decor has a quintessential southern comfort feel and will make any out of towner feel welcome.   I don't suggest eating lunch here though; if it happens, it's a wrap. You'll be knocked out like a newborn after boobie feeding. Service is good, food is decent and overall an okay spot to grab a meal."}
{"text":"I have been told this place was great for years. I finally went and in and was mad at myself for waiting so long before finally going in there. The food was fantastic. An easy atmosphere, a menu with a good variety. Definitely understand why it's always busy during lunch time. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Cornbread, soul rolls and shrimp creole OH MY! Shrimp Creole rivaled any I have eaten in Louisiana.  All very good. DW had the sampler and a salad; she was quite pleased. Definitely disagree with the negative reviews. We'll return next time we are in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Service was great! Servers had awesome personalities and were very hospitable. However, the food..... Sucked. The collards were not cook well and my salmon patties were burnt. The corn bread (which is what they are known for) was extremely dry and tasted like it came out of a box. We waited over an hour and a half to be seated (granted we did have a party of 7) only to be disappointed. This was not good Soul Food at all."}
{"text":"Good soul food in a great downtown setting.  Not the best I've tasted but darn good.  The cornbread is outstanding."}
{"text":"Second time may be a charm but the first time was a complete failure. Thank you to management, Veronica in particular, for making a bad experience and almost the last experience one worth trying again. Salmon patties were very dry and not seasoned as described, potato salad or should we say mayonnaise salad was horrible. The yams were hard as if they were freshly cut and simply plated. The greens were soaked in garlic and had entirely too many stalks. The macaroni and cheese was tasty but in conjunction with everything else on our plates was room temperature. Tiger wood drinks were very tasty. Our server was not at all attentive to our needs. If she would have given us her name I would have very well called her out in this review. She did refill our drinks once and left the remaining glasses of lemonade and sweet tea on the table which implied.....self serve. My fiance absolutely loved the cornbread loaves and fried whiting. I detested the cornbread loaves. The initial one that I received had obviously been sitting out too long. It was cold. When I mentioned it to the waitress she informed me that she knew the loaves were left out and that a new batch would be up any minute. She did bring a fresh loaf but I was just flabbergasted that she would serve something she new shouldn't have been served. Overall, the experience was not very pleasing. However, our entire meal was comped by Veronica. She apologized for the service and invited us to come back. I must admit I am a little reluctant but because she heard our concerns we will give Mert's another try. I see their are multiple good reviews on here and hated to have to be the one to add a negative review. However, this was our experience."}
{"text":"I miss working downtown... Mert's is one of the reasons why.  Aside from the crowd that it attracts (sometimes it's hard got get a table from what I remember).... everything is very likable at Mert's.  Comfort food galore!  The place is tucked in the middle of a block, but once you find it, you'll definitely remember where to go when you are hungry.    I also remember the staff being very good, speedy (to get people in and out) and friendly."}
{"text":"1. CORNBREAD! 2. Amazing southern food, everything was equally delicious. Great place to feel at home and fix your craving for fried chicken and all things southern.  Their cakes look incredible too. Try and save room, I wasn't able to and regret not taking a piece to-go."}
{"text":"Cute place and good food! Saturday brunch started with the soul rolls, which were two egg rolls stuffed with collards, rice, chicken and black-eyed peas. We added Texas Pete for extra spice. Yum! Definitely order those if you go. I had the catfish/shrimp creole combo lunch & my husband had the meat lovers omelet. We were both satisfied and enjoyed our meals. The shrimp creole is a \"must\" try. The catfish is a \"maybe\" try.  The omelet is a \"must\" try. The portions are large and the prices are low. This is a great place for soul food. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I was in N.C for Heroes Con, and this place came highly recommended. Boss and I had a few meals here, and let me tell you. Everything is great. I was especially a fan of the collard greens and sweet tea. The Mac and cheese is also *awesome* and worthy of being on your place. Service is outstanding, I wish this place was closer."}
{"text":"Another great find in Charlotte!  Some things on this menu were 5 stars.  The salmon cakes were one of them.  Some things were tasty, but average as compared to other Great Charlotte southern food spots.   It is well worth the stop though and is another great example of southern food.  Get the salmon cakes.  For sides get the yams (the best we have had in town) and the cabbage was solid.  Mac n cheese was good but not our favorite in town.   Oh by the way the cornbread is pure heaven.  Don't eat more than your serving though because it will fill you up too much for dinner !"}
{"text":"Nothing will ever be like Grandma Rachel's, but Mert's comes close.  I'm a pescetarian (veggies and seafood only), and I can eat here.  Service is usually pretty good, though it gets crowded on weekdays at lunchtime.  To avoid that, try to arrive before 11:30 a.m. or after 1 p.m.  Outside seating is extra bonus if the weather is nice, but you'll have to endure the nearby construction noise."}
{"text":"I came to Charlotte for a work related conference and decided to come to to Merts for lunch on a Sunday based off of a recommendation from a coworker that had visited a while back.  Maybe it was because this joint was so hyped by my coworker, but Merts kind of disappointed me.  I took a stroll from my hotel and arrived at Merts and the first thing I see is a line out the door.  I think to myself \"This place has got to be good if people are willing to wait outside on a cold and cloudy day like this.\"  I step into Merts and the first thing I notice is the dim lighting.  While it the environment looked comfy, it was just so jam packed that immediately I thought about leaving and coming back at a later time.  In the end I just decided to get takeout.  Since the place was so busy, it took me a long time, maybe 10 minutes? to place an order.  Then I waited another 20 minutes for them to get me my food.  Maybe it's just the Sunday Lunch rush, but the place is way understaffed and way too small to cater to so many patrons.   Now onto the food.  After receiving my food I walked back to my hotel to enjoy some BBQ.  I want to start off by saying that the cornbread that came with my food was probably the highlight of the meal.  It was just that good.  I also got mac and cheese, BBQ ribs, and green beans.  The mac cheese were definitely disappointing, not very gooey with cheese and was just overall something I could have made better at home.  The ribs while tasty, were over sauced and a bit tough.  The green beans were just green beans and I didnt have too high of an expectation for them, but they were so mushy and watery that I couldn't believe that Merts would serve it and charge money for them.  Overall, the experience was kind of negative, but I haven't given up on Merts.  A lot of people seem to have had a good experience here and I will definitely give it another shot the next time I'm here."}
{"text":"The food here is SO GOOD and the people that work there treat you like family! The only reason they lost a star was because the service was really slow in the beginning. I actually stared at our appetizers on the cook line for at least 10 minutes. Once the food got there, it was worth the wait! The fried green tomatoes were amazing and the soul rolls were a table favorite. I got the beef ribs with macaroni & cheese. My friend got the salmon cakes and loved them."}
{"text":"Me and my family were in Charlotte for my Sorority's conference and we decided to go to Mert's for our last night in Charlotte. The wait wasn't bad and they accommodated for a party of 9 which was also nice because most small restaurants would just seat you at different tables. We did not think the food lived up to the hype...at all. Lemonade...not freshly squeezed, even though the server said everything is made in house and fresh. Cornbread and Soul Roll...best part of the meal. Anything fried....TOO GREASY. I got fried catfish and my plate was covered in grease and whenever my fork went into the fish, more grease would spill out...EW! One food runner, female, came to our table with the wrong food. After no one claimed the wrong food she says, \"Do yall even know what you ordered?!\".....ummm CLEARLY you just have the wrong food. Let's just say everyone has something bad to say about their entree meal. Someone in the kitchen needs to change the oil, drain the food with a napkin (simple) and avoid getting grease on the entire plate. The yams tasted like they were drenched in maple syrup...and that's it....not good at all. My moms cooks better soul food."}
{"text":"I read a lot of great reviews for Mert's Heart & Soul and even got a recommendation to go there from my dad. For me, the dining experience was fine but not anything to write home about. They were out of cornbread when I first got there, so I had to wait 20-minutes for that. I am not exactly sure of why they were out, because I wasn't there at a busy time. Once I did get the corn bread, it was hot and tasty. I would have preferred more butter, because it was a tad dry.  Since I don't eat a lot of meat, I had the \"vegetable plate\" which allowed me to pick three sides. I had mac & cheese, collards, and baked beans. The mac & cheese was tasty, but a little bland for my ideal. This was more of a classic mac & cheese while I prefer something with a little zip to it. The collards were good. They seemed a bit sweet to me whereas I tend to prefer mine either spicy or tangy. The texture of the collards was right on. The baked beans were totally edible. Once again, they just weren't my favorite kind. They were all pinto beans in a kind of thin sauce. I prefer my baked beans in a thicker & spicier sauce. I got banana pudding to go for dessert which was delicious."}
{"text":"Promised myself in the breakfast review I wrote in early July that I would go back for lunch.  Check!  Been twice for lunch now and each time walked away fully, full and happy.  First trip brought fried catfish, candied yams and a small salad with blue cheese dressing.  The catfish is fried whole and comes with some spicy, mayo-based sauce on the side.  Splash on some hot sauce and a squeeze of lemon and you get, YUM!  The sides were good as well.  Second visit, I went with the lunch special of the day, beef liver and onions.  OK, I know some of you just went, \"GROSS\"!  Don't be haters!  Liver is delicious, especially when it's prepared like this.  Slight char on it and covered in a great tasting   brown onion gravy. Tried the mac n cheese this time and it made me smile also.  They also bring a small individual loaf of cornbread and honey butter with lunch orders.  It is moist and flavorful and is a great add to the meal.  Service was fast and friendly on both lunch visits just like at breakfast.  Thankfully I work at the Southern end of Tryon and Mert's is towards the Northern end, just across from the Hearst Tower on College St.  Let's just say, I need that longish walk back to cubeville after a big, delicious lunch like this..."}
{"text":"Total gem! Awesome Southern cooking at a very affordable price. We came here for lunch before heading to the airport on our way out of time, and were very glad we did. The atmosphere is cozy and quirky, and the food was absolutely DELICIOUS! I ordered the pulled pork plate, which I would highly recommend, especially if you enjoy Carolina style BBQ. My wife ordered the fried chicken, which was also very tasty. The sides were all good, especially the collard greens. Wish I could have taken a container home with me."}
{"text":"Parking: parking deck behind the location, bring your ticket and they will validate for you. Location:  uptown, beside Holiday Inn Sunday early afternoon Seated immediately Service good Average cost for combo plates $$ Food:  pros-hot in temperature, fast service, beef ribs had great flavor; cons- soul food rolls were greasy and falling apart on the plate (better presentation in the past), chicken and fish could have a better batter and fried a little bit longer, Mac and cheese- disappointing and dry"}
