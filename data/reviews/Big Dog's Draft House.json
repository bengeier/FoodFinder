{"text":"I have been going to the Draft House for many years and have always enjoyed the food and the experience, but lately the food hasn't been that good and the new staff in the dining room has alot to be desired.  They were unattentive, gave us the wrong check, had to beg for a drink refill, and were pre-occupied with something else going on...not a good experience...very disappointed"}
{"text":"Got the fried chicken and mashed potatoes with broccoli ! It was so delish ! Wasn't cooked to long and had great flavor"}
{"text":"I have been there a number of times and have tried a variety of food items and I enjoyed them all.  The nachos are huge so be prepared to share them with some friends.  The ribs are one of my favorites.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  Great place to hang with your friends and/or watch a game.  I will definitely continue to go there.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I went to meet my mother here for lunch (she is a regular at this place ). So first,  the atmosphere was good.  I ordered the pulled pork sandwich (garbage), the pork was tough and really seemed like yesterday's left overs (after it sat out and got dry), overloaded with a overwhelming bbq sauce that still couldn't mask the flavor of the nasty pork! The fries were good, and me trying to be positive, just figured some cooks have different standards (I wouldn't dare say Chef!).  So that said,  I hadn't seen my mother in a long time, and she seemed to be enjoying her food, so I didn't mention how much I disliked my food (although it was evident after I didn't take more than a couple bites after I had just talked up how much I would like a pulled pork sandwich). The last straw for me was when as we were walking out, our waitress mentions, loudly, to the hostess \"wow they took forever\". I figure she hadn't seen her tip yet, and I probably should have went back and taken it back! but I did nothing as she gave us another sarcastic comment before we left. I will say again, my mother is a regular here so I didn't want to make her feel uncomfortable.  I kept my mouth closed, even though I feel we did nothing wrong for sitting there for a couple hours catching up on missed moments.  we bought food, drinks, and tip well..  I thought that's what restaurants were for??  Please correct me if I'm wrong!"}
{"text":"The food was ok, greasy and oily. I'm especially grossed out by one of the wait staff clipping his fingernails in the dining area, in front of patrons while talking to other wait staff. Super gross. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Not as good as the other Big Dog's location, but they still have excellent beer of course.  Yummy, yummy IPA and many others.  The reason I don't like this location as much is it seems to always be much more crowded and filled with smoke.  Also the room is more cavernous & less appealing.  They have a separate dining area which is good if you want to get away from the smoke.  Menu items differ somewhat from the other location- you can't get fish tacos here, but you can get some other fat- and cholesterol-laden goodies such as Spicy Mac N' Cheese (with jalapenos).  Make sure to stop by for hoppy hour (3-6 PM) when beers are only $2."}
{"text":"Live in GV & been a weekly visitor to this spot ever since they closed their Sahara/Torrey Pines location. Always had a great experience...until tonight. 

Guy sitting in the bar had his dog leashed, but was allowing the pup (approx 3-4mo old Husky) to run all around the bar causing several people to trip over the leash or run into the dog. I was one of those people. The guys response after I tripped was simple; He barked at me with an attitude and said \"WATCH OUT!\" When asking around, it turns out that guy was KURT, the owner.

Very classy. The owner allowing his non-service animal to run around in an unsupervised manner in a loud and heavy traffic led bar environment with no care for customer and employee safety. Apparently it was MY fault that his dog was running around the bar. Last I checked, a non-service animal in a restaurant was not in compliance with the Health Department, who I've already contacted and filed a complaint with. As well as both City & County Business Licensing and LVMPD SIS (Liquor Licensing). 

While you may have a good lawyer, ultimately it's your responsibility to keep employees, customers and other guests safe inside of your venue/property. Hopefully your negligence to do so, bad attitude, and shitty disposition disrupts your business and costs you future money. Have some accountability and change your attitude Kurt. Smh"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  Best chicken fingers and (garlic)  fries in town!  Trust me.  Too bad they closed the Rainbow location,  as this one is a bit far away... but it's kinda worth the drive!  Great beer great food."}
{"text":"The food is great! Love it. 

The beer is great! Love it.

As a Craft Brew fanatic, give Big Dog's some credit. It is hard to be a successful craft brewery out here because the water sucks. 

(Water in my opinion is the most important and one of the most outstanding ingredients in beer)

Like stouts? Try theirs. They have a fantastic Light Beer called \"Leg Lifter\" that is a great novice beer to introduce to those that are unfamiliar with craft beer. Let that deter you from greedy beer giants like Anheuser-Busch and MillerCoors and become apart of the revolution.


The Packers, I could care less about but they don't scare me away from this place. I recommend this place even to Bear fans. The staff and regular basis seems to be pretty open minded to the barback/buss/support guy who wears a Bears jersey everyday hahahaha.

Wish the bartenders would be a little more passionate about the product. They don't really seem to care to elaborate on their beers to those interested. Let me hear about it man, I know you would probably care more if I put 20 dollars in one of your machines!"}
{"text":"My husband and I come here often with our daughter. We usually sit on the restaurant side which is great for families. The food is amazing (especially the cheese curds!) and their beer is on point! Prices are rather cheap for the size of the portions and the entire wait staff is so friendly and accommodating. The bar side is usually busy with a mixed crowd of mid-late 20's up to the retired. Definitely a relaxing and fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Great food. Liz and Courtney are great breakfast waitresses. Beer is amazing! Huge variety made in house. Locally owned and operated. Friendly people and a great place to watch sports. It is a packers bar but they are friendly fans!"}
{"text":"Fast and efficient service with great atmosphere. Sat in bar area but noticed they also have a non smoking dining area and a patio (pretty small). Great beer selection and specials. Overall, great experience and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I went twice. The first time the bartenders were very rude very snotty wouldn't help me at all would not even get me a drink for almost 45 minutes and after I had put in $600 into the machine I thought it was busy so I'll give them another chance I came back in 5 days later it was slower so I thought that the service would be better but once again the service was horrible I didn't even care about winning on the machines because everyone was just so rude and wouldn't give me a drink so I left and have been back since"}
{"text":"The food was deeeeelicious! Beer cheese soup is amazingly good, the wings and the pastrami sliders too but the soup is a must!"}
{"text":"Granted it was almost 1:00p.m. on a Saturday afternoon, but I wanted breakfast and they stop serving at 1:00p.m. OK, ordered egg whites, hashbrowns, whole wheat toast, coffee black.  It wasn't that the food was bad, it's just that it sat underneath a heat lamp for probably 20 min and was almost cold when I got it, almost 30 min later.  Waitress was very good, no problems.  Yet the price was way too high for the quality of food.  Like over $12? Plus the tip, not a great value in my estimation.  But hey, if your a packer fan this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"In am from Wisconsin and wanted to love this place. Maybe they're bad in the salad department. For $12.95,  I didn't expect a pile of wilted lettuce with a chunk of dried up, rock solid beef from some else's dinner in it. Very disgusting."}
{"text":"My favorite brew house. Good food, great tap list and bartenders like Sarah and Nancy and servers like Chelsea make are always super cool. Stop by a couple times a week with friends or solo and always enjoy it. Please brew more of the bourbon red, it was mind blowing. Also awesome guest taps and they turn the soccer matches on for me. Also annual beerfests....how can you go wrong? The only thing that would make it better is droppin the packers vibe for a Raider Nation one but that's just wishful thinking. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVED it! The cheese curds and the beer brat sandwich was phenomenal! The service was a slam dunk, attentive, without being intrusive. My only regret was that I didn't pick up a 6pk of that Las Vegas lager they have before I left back for California. I will have to research shipping, or just get back over there sooner than later!"}
{"text":"Literally our home away from home sometimes. I live across the street. Can get extremely busy during football season. If you want a table or bar seat be prepared to show up hours in advance. Food Is great and beer selection even better. Always a great spot for any gathering."}
{"text":"Great service, friendly people/workers, amazing atmosphere.  The food is good, can't tell you anything about the beer though. My one big main critique is that the workers don't check up often, even before people started to come in for the Sunday Night Football game. Other than that, awesome place. GoPackGo!"}
{"text":"Another great experience here at The Draft House.  Love the Staff, people, and food.  If you have a bad experience here, please talk to that staff.  They are great folks like you and I.  Thank you Draft House!"}
{"text":"Went to Big Dogs for their classic Reuben. I love the sweet potato fries there are none better especially with their special sauce. However, the Reuben wasn't as good as it has been in the past. I think they are now using lunch meat type of corned beef.  They put apples in their sauerkraut now. It wasn't the best sandwich I've ever had there. The service by the bartender was excellent. I didn't get her name but she has Platinum and dark hair half and half. As busy as the bar was she served me very quickly got my beer within seconds and got my food order very quickly. Kudos to the service"}
{"text":"Blessedly way off the Strip when you're in the mood for such things (um, frequently?), the biggest surprise is how uniformly excellent the beers are coming from a place whose name makes you think of frat boys brewing beer in water cooler bottles. A tasty IPA, a delicious roasty coffee hinting stout, a pale ale of near perfection, and no doubt everything they do is handled equally well. Runs a bit dark, and has a pleasant, friendly atmosphere that's a refreshing change from the general bleakness of the Chicago Brewing Company. Definitely worth a visit if you're up for hanging out and drinking good beer. And probably quite a few more visits after that. Cheers."}
{"text":"Returned to Big Dog's tonight on invitation from Kevin Weisner after a not so great experience.  Service was great.  Management was great. Ordered the cheese curds, which are highly recommended.  Comfort food on steroids.  Ordered a cheeseburger, which was prepared perfectly, and it was so big I'll have 1/2 a burger for lunch tomorrow.  My first experience was just a bad night for them.  Everything ran smoothly tonight and their patrons seemed happy.  I will definitely return and a big high five and thank you to Big Dog's"}
{"text":"Worst service ever! Sat for 20 minutes without even an acknowledgement from staff... No beverage offer, nothing! I do have to say that the hostess was nice, and seated us right away. It was downhill from there... We ended up leaving. Never going back! Found a \"real\" Green Bay Packers bar that actually wants your business... Check out Jackson's..."}
{"text":"Super fun local brewery - with tasty treats and yummy drinks!"}
{"text":"I'm not a cheese head, (haha, no offense!) but I do love this place. The service is phenomenal with friendly, smiling servers. The food is surprisingly very good! The rib eye steak is 5 star restaurant excellent. The fish n chips is also excellent. The atmosphere is nice and relaxed. I would absolutely recommend. I just wish they would put the \"7 layer taco quesadilla\" back on the menu that was recently removed!"}
{"text":"Wow! What a great place! The food was great, the beer selection is awesome AND great service!  I am becoming a regular...."}
{"text":"Forgot to mention it is a sports bar with many many TV screens available in one room and another dining room that doesn't have all the noise, which is nice for whatever mood you are in."}
{"text":"My only negative is cigarette smoke smell. Ok with that out of the way. Cheese curd is good brat was good. Beer was good. Waitress was good. Decor is cool. They have signs everywhere that are fun to read."}
{"text":"Went this afternoon after work to watch what was supposed to be a game played mostly by Packers \"scrubs\" against az cardinals.  My second time here.  To my surprise, it was not only packed but standing room only.  Ordered the mountainous roadhouse nachos, tri-colored chips, with lotsa guac, sour cream, onions, peppers, blk olives and mild at best, salsa (meat extra).  Enough to take home seconds.  For the entree, the trio of fried perch sliders were awesome!  served with real french fries and delicious root beer that tastes homemade.  Great food and a great game (it's about time) by GB winning 33-7.  The place is filled with packer memorabilia and staunch fans galore.  Would give it 5 stars except for limited seating on a very busy day and a snafu by the kitchen regarding our nachos, but that happens anywhere  Otherwise, very friendly bar and alot of fun!  They serve real wisconsin walleye after 5 for dinner with baked spud and salad. Plan to go back to try that!"}
{"text":"Dope spot for some home kooked brews,nice environment,good music.the food is a lil wack but the brews make up for it."}
{"text":"Great food and delicious beer. This place is loved by the locals, which says a lot, but note that this is a really smokey place when it's busy."}
{"text":"I like this place.  I used to LOVE it!  Yea, it's old. It's been there for a long time.  It always seems clean to me, although we usually sit in the bar area.  I think in the dining room, the booths might be a little worn & springy (not in a good way), although I haven't been back there in a while.

The food is always tasty.  I've never eaten a bad item from the menu and their custom brews are always good.  I like the \"38 special\" which is a mix of their red hydrant ale (a bit to bitter on its own) and their original pale ale.  It's a perfect blend IMO.  They have great burgers and I used to love the Big Dog's salad.

The downside:  Over the past several years, the Big Dog salad got smaller and smaller, even though it went up in price.  It used to be big enough for 2 meals.  Now it's barely filling for 1 meal.  I know that happens all over.  I don't like it...  thumbs down!  The service has also become spotty.  It's kind of a crap-shoot and it can depend where you sit.  I used to like to sit in the bar, on the side by the door, where there's a long row of tables with booth type seats on one side and stools on the other.  I found the service there is way lacking most of the time... it's further from the kitchen.

If I'm in the mood for a beer and a burger out, this is good place to go.

Was there last night, about 10:45 and they only had a \"late night\" menu.  It said served 11pm-8am.  I was expecting the regular menu.  It took a very long time for anyone to acknowledge us.  In fact, we first went to sit in my old favorite spot because the other side was full.  There was a bus boy at a nearby table who didn't even acknowledge us.  I said, \"lets move\" when I noticed tables at the end of the bar, so we'd be a little closer to the action.  That bus boy finally came back to ask if we wanted drinks and said he'd be back with menus (why not show up with menus?).  It actually took a very long time to get menus and we were super hungry.  I considered leaving because it was also taking a VERY long time for our waitress to make her first appearance.  I was concerned it might take forever to get our food, etc.  My guy wanted to stay when he saw her approaching our table.  It was cool, after she took our order she was on it the rest of our visit.  She even brought him another soda when his was only half gone...  nice!  Like I said, spotty service, up & down...  we actually got both last night, lol."}
{"text":"Filet Sliders were Excellent!!! $9.95 + onions & mushrooms (Angus for $7.95)
3 mini burgers. Cooked to perfection, and held that through my entire meal. (They didn't cool off and get tough, or rubbery). I recommend the Balsamic Onions & Garlic Mushrooms to top them off. (won't need any garnish beyond that)

Big 10\" Pizza. A Salad which looked, well she finished it.......
The Home Brewed beers!!!! Red Hydrant hit the spot tonight.
Garlic \"Knots\" bread knots, warm, tender, nice. Quality Bread!!

And we weren't the only ones! Restaurant & Bar was hopping. Tunes at a level to feel it. 
Once again, Excellent visit to the Draft House!

PSA: Football season is coming. Be Warned!!!!!"}
{"text":"Had Cobb salad it was huge, lots of chix, bacon, blue cheese avocado and boiled eggs we had the smokey avocado ranch dressing. Also had the broiled walleye not to impressed  , had a few bones a little dry , most of the menu is great, big portions. I've been here maybe a dozen times and the walleye was the only disapointment. Ck it out u won't b sorry"}
{"text":"This place serves great beer and food 24 hours a day!  What else can you ask for?  

I went for the first time when I was visiting my parents in July.  We had already eaten, but looked at the menu for kicks.  The menu had great beer food like bratwursts, bavarian pretzels, etc. in addition to things like pulled pork tacos and pizzas.  Great variety!  There is a 24 hour breakfast menu as well.

Big Dog's brews its own beers, and I was able to try the Belgian Strong Ale (9.0% abv) and the Barleywine (11.5% abv).  Both of them were excellent...especially the Barleywine!  They have a huge range of beers starting off at low abv's and moving up through your 11.5% styles.  There was something for everyone and there are daily food and drink specials!  I know that on Tuesdays beers are $2 off for 24 hours and burgers are 2 for 1.  Our bartender was fantastic and we will definitely be back to see him.  

Most of the time the smoking in restaurants/bars in Vegas really bothers me, but the ventilation in this place is so awesome, that I didn't even notice when the people around me were smoking.  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Awesome beers!!! I have drank most of the and alway eat after a few beers. Weekends they have live music and the place is always crowed. Love this place."}
{"text":"Our party of 8 came in and we were quickly seated..... The bartender came and put two tables together for us and made us feel at home (good job) then he took our drink order an and when he was done the waitress came and took our food order... I ordered the fish and chips but to tell you the truth I thought the fish and chips were VAN DE CAMPS BUT EVERYTHING else was very good very  fresh..... The service  was fantastic"}
{"text":"So... This place is really good if you get the right thing on the menu. Beer is one of those things. The wait staff is great there. 

Eat:
Fish and chips
Pecan walleye
Ribs

Do not eat:
\"roasted\" chicken (it's basically just burnt and dry chicken)
Any salad other than the \"draft house\" salad, which is just a side salad. 

Cheese curds. I get these Every Time I go to big dogs and I am always let down. They smell great, look great with a nice golden beer batter fry but they are DRY DRY DRY. A good curd will have some melt to it but these are over fried and not worth the $10."}
{"text":"The food was on point, made me feel like I was home!! Our server Carla was excellent. She was very knowledgeable, and helpful when we were deciding which beers to try. She listened to our special requests when ordering our food and everything came out as requested. She split our bill up correctly on the first try. We eat out often and often this seems to be a hard task for a lot of servers. She was very prompt and patient as we had lots of questions and stories to tell her."}
{"text":"We stopped by this past weekend to check out the Peace Love & Hoppyness party.  We visited it too last year and had a great time so we were looking forward to it again.  It's a pretty reasonable beer garden.  For $30, you received a glass pint glass and $30 tokens for beer.  This year featured 50 beers to choose from but a majority of them were IPAs or heavier.  I don't mind a super heavy/dark beer once in a while but it's difficult for most people to spend an evening consuming IPAs.  Another thing was that 2 of the lighter beers were out early in the night further limiting the choices.  

Overall it was a good time.  The bands were at a reasonable volume, it was outside, eclectic group of people and a good price for a Saturday night out."}
{"text":"From out of the area, Been to many brew pubs across the county. Found the Big Dog cause G-friend was starving. Great brew pub, true Las Vegas pub environment. Sat at the bar played poker while waiting for food order. Food order was slow in coming but was winning at video poker, so did not mind. Red hydrant ale was great with the red hydrant chilly and a quesadilla. The two of us walked out stuffed and very satisfied!!!
The BIG DOG brew pub is a local gem !"}
{"text":"Terrible service. was there over a half hour without anyone asking if we were ready to order.Wait staff,bartender and hostess were more interested in hanging out with each other then serving any guest.  My husband got diarhea shortly after eating there."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant! I probably come here once a week and it never fails. The food is amazing and the service is absolutely wonderful! I'm not a big burger person, but their burgers are amazing. Their Mac and cheese is also worth a try!"}
{"text":"Service was pretty good. Chelsea did a great job in making sure we were doing ok and refilling our drinks. Food was very tasty and fresh. We'll be back again."}
{"text":"Great service, our bartender was so attentive and respectful and deserving of the best possible review. Food was good beer was good, I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Love this place for the beer, food and shuffle board! Highly recommend the Mac and cheese with the added ghost pepper cheese and the broccoli salad... My only issue with this place is the vocalist of the band playing on the patio this Tuesday October 14th (not sure if it's an every Tuesday night thing or a one off performance)... Not that her vocals were bad, I actually enjoyed the band.  Her attire is simply something I've seen at establishments such as Sapphire's, which I think is great at such places, just not at a family restaurant."}
{"text":"The Draft House is very likable. It's the kind of bar you can hang out at for a while. During the day they have the barn open which is a separate restaurant area (especially good for those w/ kids). Food is served day & night, though if you're in there during late night hours, you'll receive a much smaller menu. The staff is exceptional. I haven't had a staff issue yet. They're friendly in the barn, they're friendly around the bar area. The graveyard bartender, Ty, is an especially cool guy. I've seen him running around like crazy when it's slammed & he still manages to keep us from going dry (even when we're sitting at a table away from the bar). The grave Chef is also pretty cool. They do brew their own beer & have a large board showing the current offerings. 

They have certain regular brews as well as seasonal ones that appear from time to time. I will tell you up front - I actually hate beer. I'm truly not that fond of it. I'm a bit jealous of beer drinkers, really. They can just walk into a place & order a drink nice & easy-like. For a mixed drink it all depends on the bartender's skills & for wine, well, most places only stock the cheapest crap (plus it seems pretentious sometimes to try to be ordering wine in some establishments). So yeah, I'm jealous. I will say though, I can drink the beer here & it's pretty good. The best regular brew is certainly Red Hydrant. It goes down pretty easy & works w/ most any food there. The Black Lab Stout's pretty good (not as good as a Guinness, but pretty good) - it goes well w/ some hot chicken fingers. Several of my friends are quite fond of the Leglifter Light. It's a bit too light for me personally but didn't taste bad. Out of the seasonal brews, my favorites are probably the Raspberry Wheat & Cherry Wit. They run out a little too quickly though, so if you see them on the board, you have to try them then. No putting it off until next visit or they'll disappear on you. Rebel Red was another good seasonal one. It's always worth it to check out the board. They actually list beer pairing options on the menu. :)

On to the food - mostly good. 

Garlic fries (smothered in garlic chunks - you'll smell like them for days), cheddar cheese curds w/ both horseradish & ranch sauces, sweet potato fries, chicken fingers - all great stuff. Grandma's Pot Roast Melt is very good - muenster cheese & horseradish sauce w/ au jus! Salads are huge & quite tasty. 

Southwest Melt is tasty - it's a turkey & pepper jack affair w/ avocado (more on this below).  Wisconsin Steak Brat (a ribeye, a brat & mozzarella on a bun) is pretty good though the brat was a little bit salty for me. Fish & chips are decent. Burgers are great - I've discovered that I especially like the sauteed spinach on there. It turns it into a great garlicky gooey mess, but now that I've discovered it, I always get it. The Phillys are good. I especially like the Southwest Philly w/ poblano, pepper jack & avocado (below!) Breakfast foods are tasty as well. 

The other side of things - there can be consistency issues sometimes, particularly between the day & night shifts. Apparently one of the daytime chefs likes to get a little chinzy with things. You'll order a philly that comes out w/ a perfectly respectable amount of meat at nighttime & you might get only 2/3 of that during the day. The avocado is a prime example of this. Ordering on the late night menu, the Southwest Philly will come w/ 2 kinda thin slices of avocado on each half of the sandwich. Not overkill like they're robbing the boss or something, but bun coverage. It's the proper amt when you see the sandwich. Now, order that during the daytime & you just might get only one paper thin slice per half. I once ordered avocado on my burger during the day. It's an extra buck to do so. When it came I got one of the thinnest slices of avocado I had ever seen - and only one, mind you, on this big ol' burger. I was like, really? I paid an extra buck for this? 

Other less than pleasing things: I got the walleye broiled w/ citrus glaze once & it was seriously bland. I might try it one of the other ways that they serve it sometime. I've had the grilled chicken sandwich twice, once during the day & once at night. Both times it was dry & burnt so I dunno what's up w/ that one. Fillet Sliders & the Malibu Turkey Wrap are just ok. The only salad option on the late night menu (I think it's the Southwestern Steak) is just ok. On the late night menu there is some seriously good food, but not if you want to have something lighter. I'd like to see another option or two added for when I don't really want fried food & lots of meat which does happen sometimes. 

So, this place gains a 4 from me primarily for service, atmosphere, & beer selection. Most of the food is good. Much of it is great. Now if they'd just fix the consistency issues & give me some damn avocado during the day when I order it, I could consider bumping them up some more."}
{"text":"I come to the Draft House for one thing.  Their beer.  Yes, they have some tasty food, I'll get into that in a second, but their beer is king.  I don't know about their other beers though, as I've only ever had their in-house made ones.  Their IPA is about the best I've ever had, and while I'm a Guinness boy to my core, their stout almost makes me stray.  Their Red Hydrant Ale is also very good, I'd say on par with any good ale out there.  Now, if they could make a Cider I'd be very happy.
Food:  The food is okay, but it's not the best.  Their Cheese Curds are, I'd say, their best option.  You'd think for a Wisconsin bar that things like Nachos would be just dripping with cheese, but you'd be wrong.  Their garlic fried are just regular fried with an epic-crap-ton of raw chopped garlic on top, not so good. 

All in all, I'd come back (and I do!), and I'd definitely tell anyone looking for a good small-brand locally brewed beer to check this place out."}
{"text":"First timer at Big Dogs...and probably last timer.  I don't think I'll be back.   Went to Big Dog's last night, it was packed in the bar for Monday night football, and I had high hopes of good food and service in the restaurant.  We got beer and an appetizer. Ordered the cheese curds for appetizer. They were okay, it seemed they might have sat quite a while in the kitchen before being delivered to our table.  We  never got dinner  After waiting long over an hour for dinner, we asked for our check, paid and left.. The waitress apologized, stating they were experiencing troubles over the new menu. 

UPDATE:  The manager contacted me with an apology for our experience and invited us to return to Big Dog's for another try.  Everyone deserves a second chance.  Will take them up on that real soon and update."}
{"text":"We were visiting Las Vegas from Orlando, FL and wanted an experience off the strip as well as to try some local craft beer. This place is about 15 miles north of the strip and really not difficult to locate. Our party of 5 was greeted and seated at a spacious booth. Our server, Debra, explained the beers in detail, and we ordered several, with Peace, Love and Hoppiness being our favorite. Our traveling companions were not as well versed in craft beer, but Debra managed to get them beverages they enjoyed. We shared a pizza and several entree salads, and the food was awesome! But it was the beer we came for, and we thoroughly enjoyed every sip. We were even told we could purchase a 6-pack of Peace, Love & Hoppiness to take with us at $1.00 off! So we did, and in it went in the suitcase traveling back home. I would return to Big Dog on my next trip back to Sin City. And Thank You, Debra, you were wonderful!"}
{"text":"This place deserves more than 5 stars! I have been going to Draft for years and have really no complaints. The food and craft beer are excellent! Try the chicken wings they are the best in town. 7 layer quesadilla is also plus. Leglifter and the 38 Special are my favorite beers here. I have also been to the last 5-6 Beer festival and the are some of the best on the local scene! Thanks Draft House. See you again soon my friend!"}
{"text":"Every time my family and I visit Las Vegas, Big Dog's Draught House is a must-visit. We love the food. We love the beer. The service is great. In my opinion, Big Dog's is one of the better breweries in Las Vegas - I love the War Dog IPA. We also love their menu(although they got rid of the broccoli salad which was fantastic): the Camp Randall is fabulous, the Bratzle is also to die for and the cheese curds can't be beat. We have not eaten anything we didn't like at Big Dog's. They also have great pulled pork and the pizza is not bad either. The recently added outdoor patio seating is a great place to dine - when the weather permits, of course."}
{"text":"I very rarely write reviews but my experience at Big Dog's definitely requires one. WOW!!! If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would. From the service to the food to the beers, everything was outstanding. Maria M. (server) along with the other servers were extremely attentive but not over-bearing. The beers are top notch. And the food... we had the cheese curds for an appetizer (incredible) and the bratzel (amazing) which we split for our meal. Thank god we did because it was huge.

This is a must do when visiting Vegas so plan a few hours to include this in your trip. You won't be disappointed. BTW... The Santa Fe Station Hotel and Casino is blocks away for those that need their gambling fix."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE Big Dogs. It's everything you want in a late night bar. We like to go there after we get off swing shift for the Pot Roast Sandwich. It's literally the greatest sandwich ever. Plus the fries are always so crispy. We also get the cheese curds sometimes because we are from the Midwest so it makes us feel at home. It's may not be the most glamorous bar in town but we wouldn't have it any other way."}
{"text":"WITHOUT A HITCH!

My friends threw a birthday party for me on Saturday night.  They reserved two huge tables behind the bar area.  It was a great turn out....about 25-30 people showed.  My lasting impression is that \"they have done this before\".  Everything was so organized and flowed very well.  As you have seen in previous posts I love to entertain and have big get-togethers and this venue I will highly recommend.

Our waitress Tiffany was really the only one taking orders if I remember right.  Most all orders were individual and you know how that goes.  This chick was amazing.  She kept everything flowing, remembering where everyone was, who order what and kept handing me drinks throughout the night. haha  The bald guy (sorry bald guy-I didnt get your name) kept the tables clean of emplied plates and bottles which is a huge pet peive of mine.  I hugged him at the end of the night because without him the tables would have been a mess.

My boyfriend ordered a select number of appetizers for everyone....nachos, cheese curds, pizza bites and some kind of spinach dip.  All were fabulous bar food.  Someone ordered the pretzel and I am still dreaming about it.....and then someone else ordered the steak sliders.  Yes we will be back for those!  I must!!!

I must say Dear Draft House....I am impressed.  What a great night!  Thanks for making my birthday special (and to my friends of course)...and I will see you soon for another pretzel and steak sliders....and some beer! ;)"}
{"text":"Great food, reasonable prices... Staff is knowledgeable about the menu... Great customer service skills... Great beer's as well..."}
{"text":"I enjoy this bar/restaurant for taking out of town company to give them a taste of something off-strip.  Also a great place to watch Packer games.  Almost like being home in Wisconsin in terms of the energy and game day atmosphere.  It had been a couple months since I'd gone here and I happened upon a slew of negative reviews.  I had to check it out to see if one of my favorite places in Las Vegas had really fallen apart.  I'm told the other locations had closed and this review does not reflect or comment on that.  That's a business matter for the owners to speak on and not the yelping public.

The menu is the same menu I remember.  I enjoy the cheese curds, Big Dog's salad, and Bratzel quite a bit.  The cheese curds are the closet thing to Wisconsin cheese curds I've had here in Las Vegas.  The Bratzel is a beautiful creation of cheeseburger, bacon and brat.  The big dog's salad is an excellent mexican style salad.  On my most recent visit I had the chicken friend steak.  The chicken fried steak was one of the better renditions of the dish I've had in town.

We dined in the dining room and our server (I want to say Lynn?) was excellent.  Long story short, I'm not quite sure where all the recent hatred for Big Dog's has come from."}
{"text":"Love the food normally, but just had to leave without even having our order taken! Sat outside, waited 15 minutes to get our drink order taken, waited another ten minutes as three other tables of people had their orders taken that had all arrived after us. Horrible experience, most likely never coming back!"}
{"text":"Decided to hit up an off th grid place for some local brews. This place has an amazing beer selection I believe 32 at the time we were there. I like IPA and tried several of their own. Peace love and hoppiness, a double IPA and another I can't remember something like dog bite or something with dog in it?  Also had some food, fish and chips and mac and cheese as well as cheese curds. All the food was good!  Fish had a nice batter that made it crispy, the mac and cheese had a wonderful smokey flavor and the curds were delicious with a crispy batter and stringy cheese. Worth checking out if you get out that way!"}
{"text":"Recently went with a friend and her dog to eat on the porch. Kind of crowded, little noisy, but what can you expect for a Friday night? Good service, friendly patrons, and great food. Had the fried cheese curds for the first time, very yummy. for sure to go again, and highly recommended for friends."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend for some food, drinks, and a little fun. Food was decent but nothing special. Drinks were decent as well, the beer wasn't as good as I was expecting and his jack and coke was a little weaker than we would have liked. And as far as the fun. . . well if you're under 40 you're going to be out of place. I probably will stick to surf city from now on"}
{"text":"First off let me just say that I love beer and good bar food! With that said Big Dogs Draft house name says it all. Seems like a perfect fit for a guy like me, well I was wrong. I have now been into this place on 2 separate occasions and both times I received crummy service. Keep in mind I have yet to try a beer or any food here. First time I went it was so crowded there wasn't anywhere available to sit, so crowded that I couldn't even find a hostess or anyone to help seat us or make sense of the chaos that surrounded us. It was football season so I gave them a pass due to the craziness that is football season. After 5 minutes of looking for help we left.

Well I thought I would give them another shot today and let's just say this is the last time I will ever attempt to eat or drink there. I walked into the bar and showered the patrons inside with the sunlight from outside the bar. A few turned to see who was walking in. I sat down at the bar right in front of the main entrance and made eye contact with 2 of the bartenders. I sat for a couple minutes while 2 of the bartenders walked back in forth in front of me  and finished their orders. I continued to wait patiently for a few more minutes without any acknowledgement. The third bartender was counting her register and was standing 8 feet from me. No \"Hello\" \"welcome to big dogs\" \"can I grab you a beer?\" None of that. Not one word was spoken to me. All I got were side eye looks and no help. 

Maybe this is the way it is here and I'm just a weird outsider who doesn't know the rules or maybe it's just a bar with really crummy customer service. I was really excited about trying some of their in house brews and finding a cool local bar with craft beers that I could call home. Oh well, I guess it's off to Lee's discount liquor next door instead."}
{"text":"Good food with a large selection, decent prices, nice atmosphere, friendly staff with tv's everywhere & a beautiful front patio.  I would give it 5 stars if they had a pool table & dartboard for something to do if you just want to hang out."}
{"text":"I'm a Wisconsin native and couldn't have been happier to find this place! The cheese curds were just like home and we also had the Wisconsin Mac n cheese. (Spicy version) and it was just that, spicy! Lol."}
{"text":"I've been coming to the Draft House almost every weekend for the past 10 years.  I have to say if I rated this place back then it would be a 5-star business.  But recently Big Dog's has self-destructed!  The menu has gone downhill and the choices its head chef have made are disgraceful, plus the prices are high for what you get.  The only thing keeping the place alive is the beer, but now their award winning brew master has moved to Tenya Creek, so I imagine it will be even harder to find their award winning brews in stock!"}
{"text":"A wonderful, country atmosphere that we couldn't help but fall in love in with the bar on the opposite side of the seating area which means no smell of smoke lingering, big plus! Loved the food, especially the mashed potatoes and clam chowder. Beer and root beer is made at the location and the root beer was so much better than A&W! A chef brings out the food to you which is something we have never seen before and it was so cool. The only downside was the waitress kept disappearing when we needed her, but it was probably be they were short handed."}
{"text":"Very delicious food. Big menu with lots of choices. Good size portions and a friendly waiter"}
{"text":"My family and I love going to Big Dog's!  Their beer is wonderful and refreshing, just typing about it is making me want one.  I personally love their 38 Special, but the last time we were there I tried their summer raspberry brew, which was also delicious.  My favorite sandwich has roast beef, horseradish, muenster cheese...might be the pot roast sandwich?  Fries are yummy and their potato cakes are good.  The service is always great.  The value is good, usually plenty left if you want to take some home.  

The location on Sahara isn't kid-friendly, and this location on Rancho is much bigger, no smoking in the main dining area, and has a kids menu."}
{"text":"Where do I start...

Service:
Not so great!! Our waitress came to our table once other than slamming my beer down and getting my food. To really not be seen again, she rather chat it up with her what seemed to be regular customer, then serve us. Basically,Never did she come back to see if I needed another beer or if my friend needed a refill on her soda. For the price you pay, I deserve better service. I almost always tip well, but today not so much.
I had to actually get out of my seat to find her just to pay!! 

Food/drink:
I ordered the dirty dog IPA. I have to say it was pretty good!! Now the philly cheese sandwich, not so worth the $11 I paid. Whoa! A bit over priced for something not that great tasting. The beer cheese soup was excellent tho. Very good!! 

Overall I do think prices are a bit high for quality of food and service. I'm actually giving 3 stars for beer and soup only. If that sucked I would have given none!!"}
{"text":"Came out for SummerBrew Fest always so fun! The new patio is great and great additions to the menu. We had there twice backed wings spicy but so good!! Perfect with a good beer. Carla is a great and friendly waitress!"}
{"text":"I give this place 5 stars for the beer alone. The Brewmaster Dave Otto is, in my opinion the Best brewer in the state, him along with his crew have amassed 11 awards, since 1993, they have even beat out some of the big boys in a few categories. My personal favorite is the Watch Dog Wit, a Belgian style white ale that is a perfect summer cooler. A Hop Head as well he makes some very bold but balanced Hop bombs. A rotation of seasonal beers keeps the menu fresh and your tastes buds coming back for more.

They also host a Beer School several times a year where participants are indoctrinated in the process that goes into making their favorite beverage.  You help make the beer and get to take some home when it is ready.  For Beer Geeks and Newbies alike http://www.bigdogsbrews.com/brewschool/"}
{"text":"There used to be a bevy of Big Dog's breweries around town. (My favorite was the Holy Cow Casino on the north end of the Strip, where I hit my first--and only--royal flush.) Now there's only one: the Draft House. And while it seems like it's there mainly for gaming, there's also food and drink on the menu.

We've been to the Draft House many times, and when we're there to eat, we usually dine in the restaurant. This time, we decided to sit in the bar, and while the service was excellent, it was so dark that we couldn't read the menu without whipping out my flashlight app.

My husband had the three-cheese burger, with swiss, pepper jack, and provolone. He said it was fine but nothing spectacular. He also swapped his fries for onion rings, which was a good move.

I opted for the cheeseburger pizza, which was topped with ground beef, lettuce, tomatoes, and onion. Because of the limited light, I didn't notice until I got home that it also was drizzled with some type of sauce (like Thousand Island dressing). This combination was a little odd, and I didn't care much for it hot, but it tasted better cold the next day.

We each had two pints, so we sampled four different beers. We're both usually big fans of IPAs, but both of the IPAs we had were too flowery, and one of those was also a little skunky. The pale ale was not memorable at all, and our favorite of the four (the 44 Magnum) was actually a blend of two of their most popular beers: Dirty Dog IPA and Red Hydrant brown. That was a tasty beverage, and one I'd try again.

Our waitress was friendly and attentive, and the prices were reasonable. But overall, I wasn't too impressed with the food or beer. I have had good meals there in the past, and the Magnum was memorable, so I would still recommend the Draft House if you're in the mood for a quick bite and a brew."}
{"text":"Great lunch,  microbrews and service. Sheila was great! The first time I went in it was just for drinks on a Tuesday night and the service was dreadful. Today more than made up for it. I will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Way older crowd slow service leaving now"}
{"text":"Good food, although kind of limited selection for vegetarians. Patio dining is nice, but too hot by afternoon."}
{"text":"Arrived at 3:40 Sunday afternoon. Per the sign on the door, I let the inside hostess that I was seated on the patio. 20 minutes later, someone took a drink order, which was delivered 10 minutes later. 10 minutes later, food order was taken. FOOD ARRIVED AT 4:30, 50 MINUTES AFTER I WAS SEATED-TERRIBLE SERVICE!"}
{"text":"What can I say...I'm a Midwest boy who went to University of WI for a couple years.  How can I give this place a bad review?  

Seriously though, the bratwurst here are awesome. As close to home as you get out west.  The beers are equally impressive.  I fancy myself a beer snob, and I love some of the special brews they have at Big Dog's.  

As much as I love the food here, I have to limit myself to only quarterly visits at best.  The dishes here are lumberjack portions!  I usually go into a short coma after a visit, but it's definitely worth it.

If you're a Packers or Badgers fan, and haven't been here yet, shame on you!

Looking forward to my Q1 visit in the spring!"}
{"text":"The food is a step-up from normal bar food. With that said, it is still bar food. None of the beers have impressed. The atmosphere is decent enough, the service is often lacking. And for what you are getting, the prices are a tad high."}
{"text":"One of our favorite bars. Nancy and Jessica are the best. We try to be there at least once a week to play some keno, have some beers and I love the cheese curds."}
{"text":"This place is a bit out of the way from the strip but worth the drive. 

We started out with the Wisconsin cheese curds..they were yummy and the creamy horseradish sauce to dip them in was wonderful. I got the butterflied grilled bratwurst on a pretzel roll and have to say it was the best bratwurst  sandwiche I ever had. It came with carmelized onions, peppers and sauerkraut.  The garlic fries were just okay, as the garlic was rather weak. I tasted the chili and thought it was too thick and pasty.

They have a nice selection of craft beers. The IPA was not overly hoppy and refreshing.  The pumpkin ale was light (would like more pumpkin) and I thought had too much cinnamon. The milk stout was smooth and creamy.  

The service was quick and friendly. The restaurant is clean,  with plenty of seating both inside and out. I love the big dog outside and the decor over all is very pleasant. (See my pics)  I look forward to visiting again the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Place has a smokey smell, beer is expensive (for what ever reason), staff is nice, Too many Wisconsin people in one area of Las Vegas, Music is nice, TVS and seating is well-placed...Floors appear dirty (dark for a reason)..."}
{"text":"By far this place has some of the best customer experience I've ever had. They are extremely attentive to your requests and generally always have super fast customer service. Hands down the best bar period in Vegas. That and I'm a Packers fan so you get the best of both worlds. 10/10 Bar. #GoPackGo"}
{"text":"Fun place to grab happy hours. Good service. I usually get wings and a well and it is fantastic after a long week of work."}
{"text":"Food is okay, nothing exceptional in my opinion, but the staff has an attitude, picked up lunch two days in a row, hostess didn't say hello, or thank you, I said I was picking up, she handed me the bill and walked away, POOR service."}
{"text":"Beer is ok. Sorry it just doesn't measure up to Oregon and Washington micro brew standards. But the food and service were great. As always."}
{"text":"I really miss the one on our side of town.  It was on Nellis Blvd and Owens Blvd.  The food was great, as was the beer; but it was the wait staff that were the crowning jewel.  The knew us and had our beers on the table as we sat down.

Those days are gone.  Destroyed by the good-old-boy network of alcohol distributors here in Nevada.  But they can't stop the brewhouse from producing Las Vegas' best microbrews, and some of the best pub grub in town.  Some of the old wait staff are there, and they remembered us, even after a year of not seeing us.

I think we're going to make the cross-town trek now that we know how much we were missing."}
{"text":"This place is just plain fun. 

The atmosphere is so lively and energetic, it's impossible not to have a good time. Big Dog's can't be beat on football Sundays, but be sure to stake out a table early, because the place gets packed. (I'm not even a football person, and I still enjoyed my experience at the Draft House, so that's saying something.)

The food and drinks are good, and the prices are reasonable. I've only eaten in the bar area, so I'm not sure what the restaurant part is like."}
{"text":"Big Dogs is the place to be to meet your friends during good weather with your fur babies! The beers are great, the environment is nice and you don't have to leave your pooch home to have fun. The food is very good as well. My favorite thing about Big Dogs are the awesome festivals they host a couple of times a year. Definitely a great local spot!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food and beer (many options)!  Vegetarian dishes.  Dog friendly.  20% military discount.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I wish they would bring back the brat patty eggs Benedict with the amazing mustard sauce rather than traditional hollandaise.  Other than missing that dish - one of our very favorite places. We are from Wisconsin and when home sick we always hit up thr Draft House.   Love grandma's pot roast melt. The best melt of any kind I have ever had!!!!"}
{"text":"First time here but it wont be my last, the atmosphere is very welcoming with it's western feel. My waiter was very friendly and the food was very tasty."}
{"text":"This place is happening. Came in on a Friday night after a long week finding the last parking spot ever. Food is hearty with substantial portions, definitely worth a taste. Would love to come back in a smaller crowd just for some chill."}
{"text":"I've been going here since I was a kid. Two decades ago I used to sit on the giant cow that used to be in the middle of the dining room. We've been here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, brought out of town guests, celebrated birthdays here, etc. 

I love that this place has had the same owner for years, and that they've made this place a unique, local place for natives and visitors to visit alike. The food is always good, and there's not often problems with the food. 

However, the service over the years has really, really gone down hill. Most recently, I went for a meal at 3:00 on a Tuesday. It was absolutely dead in the restaurant, with only one other table besides ours. Even still, it took half an hour for us to get our three entrees. It's really a shame because lately we've been passing on eating here because we don't want to wait through the awful service we've come to expect."}
{"text":"I went for the first time a few months ago with a girlfriend and have loved it ever since!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great local brew house! Been here multiple times for quick bites and early dinners. What sets this place apart is no matter how busy the place is our bar and food order always arrives quickly. If you are a \"Green Bay\" fan lots of memorabilia, cheese curds and bratwurst!"}
{"text":"The service is consistently slow, but the beer is good and the food is delicious. Sit in the bar to watch a game or sit in the dining room with the kiddos, either way it's always a good choice."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for a while now.  The food is always good and the service is great.  Gets a little crowded sometimes but it's worth it.  The pot stickers were great.  My daughter isn't much of an eater but she downed 4 of them before she got her dinner.  The buffalo wings are great!!  The cobb salad is as good as the rest of the meal.  Just an all around good place to get a good meal."}
{"text":"Finally, no rain or wind during a huge Draft House event! Weather is October cool and their Dogtoberfest is fabulous!  Quite the microcosm of people and doggies, of course!  More than 40 craft brews, brats and rockin rock n roll.  Been listening to Doors, Eagles, Beatles, some reggae, Ska, great date, fun friends or family event."}
{"text":"Went there for all you can eat shrimp Wednesday. Was very good. The service was great. No complaints about bringing more. The food was very hot and tasty!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I've got to downgrade Big Dogs from 4 stars to 2.  Simply put the service and quality have slipped.  Seems they have become complacent in their success over the years.  Hopefully, they will figure out it's time to step up their game before it's too late.  I am definitely paring back my visits and exploring new possibilities for my dining dollars.  

Recently ordered the Raspberry Chicken Salad (I've had it at least 20+ times) and was disappointed.  Salad came out wilted and not fresh.  Seemed like it had been prepared in advance, wrapped in plastic with the dressing already applied and put in the cooler.  At least that's the impression I got.  Fewer chicken and pecans than normal.  

A lot of little things add up.  Seems the servers don't do anything extra nowadays.  Sometimes I like to split a salad.  In the past they would separate it onto two plates.  Now, they will bring you an extra plate IF you ask and you can split it yourself.  I recently ordered dessert and the waitress arrived with the cheesecake and queried, \"I see you still have your fork, would you like a new one or do you want to use the one on your plate?\".  Yeah, I want to eat my cheesecake with the same fork with which I just finished my spaghetti.  Are you kidding me???  That's like me asking you, \"Do you want a tip or did you get enough from the last customer?\"  The reason I still have the fork and the dinner dishes is because you didn't clear the table yet.

There's a beer cooler near the restaurant entrance that has been broken for at least 3 months.  It has a sign on it apologizing for the inconvenience during the temporary outage.  Hell, if you aren't going to fix it - remove it and put in an extra table.  I'm sure it could be repaired in a couple days.  Loosen up the purse strings man.

Sorry to have to give up on this place, since I was a regular.  Will stop back occasionally to see if they get their S**T together, and let you know."}
{"text":"I tried the nachos and cheese curds. The food was ok. I guess people come here mostly for the brews. They have a great variety. My favorite was- what \"gose\" on in Vegas stays in Vegas. It's light, fruity and just plain delicious. The place is pretty chill, I liked that. Our server looked pretty busy. Service was ok. This place is better for the beers not the food."}
{"text":"Lee at the bar was rude, he seems more focused on doing paperwork than customer service. We had not been here since the remodeling, we had a handicapped person with us and couldn't find handicapped parking. I went inside and asked Lee, hardly looking away from his paperwork he said we remodeled, it's in back and pointed to the rear of the building, I asked how do we get there, he said drive around the building with a tinge of sarcasm, I said oh is that door new, he responded been there as long as I have. At this point I would have left if not for having gift cards that I couldn't use elsewhere. We parked the car and had a wonderful waitress and wonderful dinner, recommendation, don't let Lee ruin your night, talk with someone else, Lee consider taking a course in customer service or think about an office job, you would meet your love for doing paperwork and not have to be distracted by customers."}
{"text":"Tonight was all you can eat fried shrimp and it took 15 minutes before they brought you another order. Very slow with the check. Food was good"}
{"text":"Good beers and food.  Allowed smoking in the bar area so that detracted a little.  Smothered Fries poutine were excellent! Fish tacos and onion rings were fine but nothing special. Beer cheese soup and cheese curds were very good too!"}
{"text":"Love this place. New things on the menu all the time. Staff is fantastic.  Great entertainment on the patio. Open Mic night Sundays is lots of fun. Bread pudding and brownie Sunday is amazing."}
{"text":"Have been here before 1st time service, food, drinks were all on point this time was the worst service &food and beer was served warm :( super disappointed. Everything is lacking on this visit. Be picky on what you order some people food looked bomb mine tasted like no flavor at all so don't order the grandma's pot roast melt it taste like crap. After eating we waited over 15 mins for the check and ended up having to grab the manager to say the service was so bad food was bad and we just want to go at this point. Could be just this one time bad service or this place is just getting awful....."}
{"text":"I think the world has been brainwashed into a low bar of service, hence the many good reviews. This place is, at minimum, an argument for abolishing tipping. I agree with the reviewers regarding the service. We were handed menus, and before we could open them, we were asked what we wanted, as if the information had been magically downloaded into our heads. 

Our waitress was equally robotic. She didn't try to sell us anything, talk about the craft beers, or pretend that we were helping to pay her check in any way,

So we ordered. The food was tasty enough, albeit overpriced. The beer, not as good Aces and Ales offers a better drink experience. My stout lacked the dimension and heartiness I expect, and its flavor was dull.

My friend ordered pastrami on sourdough. It came out on rye. The took it back to the kitchen and simply scraped it on to new toasted bread, losing half the sauerkraut in the process.

We boxed our own leftovers. Our waitress did come to us at the end, smiling, hoping everything was all right. It was--just all right. Definitely not worth the price tag.

At least it was a good night out with friends. We'll go elsewhere next time"}
{"text":"What do I get for dating an ex-Badger? I get to explore all of the \"wisconsin bars\" in Las Vegas, and I must say this one is on the top of my list. The beers are awesome, food is good, and the service very friendly. It really feels like you're in an old bar in Madison.... except that you can gamble. 
I tried the Black Lab Stout and I'm not usually a fan of guiness or other comparably dark ales, but this one was amazing. I told the bartender to give me her favorite, and this was the one. It had such an intense flavor, like coffee and chocolate. It's very rich, so I don't think I could handle more than 1 or 2 of them, but it was a great choice.
I wasn't hungry at the time, but I will definitely have to return when I am, because the food looked and smelled great."}
{"text":"I had a chance to visit here over the weekend. The atmosphere was very casual, the way a brew pub should be. They have a impressive selection of both Big Dog brews and guest brews. If you are a craft beer lover this is definitely a great spot to grab a few drinks. 

We started off with the cheese curds due to many recommendations from others. I have to say, these were fantastic! I also tried the beer cheese soup, and it's probably the best cheese soup I've ever had. The the main course I got a rib-eye, with potato cakes and mac and cheese. First, the Rib-eye. The meat was fantastic, great quality, however, I wasn't a huge fan of the rub they put on it. It really hides the quality of the rib eye which I didn't think was necessary. The potato cakes were by far the best thing on the plate, very delicious. The mac and cheese tasted worse than boxed, it had zero flavor and hardly any cheese, definitely pass on that as a side option.

Beers:

I started off by trying their nitro Bourbon barrel stout. I'm not a huge fan of nitro beers, but this one was creamy, had a great whiskey barrel taste with lots of deep coffee notes. Overall, great beer. Next, while I totally despise any Miller, Bud, Coors type beers, I decided to try the Leg lifter Lager. This is by far hands down the best lager I've ever had. It's very crisp and refreshing. In fact, it was so good, I had 2 more. I finished off with their Amber Ale, which was very well balanced, good malt flavor. A very good amber that is brewed to style.

They even have 22 oz's to go in bottles which was a plus. I got 2 of those to go, War Dog IIPA and another Amber. 


Overall, this is a fantastic place to visit if you love good food and great beer. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Really surprised I haven't reviewed earlier it's in my top 5 or so bar rotation. Good beers war dog is my favorite. Great help behind the bar. Yummy food a bit pricey in my mind but I've never had a bad item. Twice baked wings are great. Brats and beer cheese soup and of course the cheese curds are all favorites. Typically not seeing a lot of skinny Wisconsinites lol but the baked salmon is very nice healthy option 
And they do I believe 4 outdoor festivals a year."}
{"text":"Been coming here since the 90s always great beer,good service is the norm.  The brat burger is worth the drive.  My favorite beer is the dirty dog IPA but check their big board as they change up frequently.   Bar has a great vibe, recognize you even if you come once in a while."}
{"text":"Pretty sure I come here too often! I love their beers, Tailwagger, Leg Lifter Light or some Las Vegas Lager. I like to meet my girlfriends here in the evening. They have daily specials.....everyone at work seems to know that Thursday is MOO & BREW day. Guess I talk about it too much. They have a separate dining room or a large bar area with tables. I've been coming here for many many years. I haven't had any bad food, some things that used to be on the menu that aren't anymore and I'd love to see them come back."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if it was the pet friendly patio, being open 24 hours, or massive list of in-house brews (in addition to plenty of guest brews) that got me to love this place, but I certainly love all of it! 

I've been a few times now and each time the wait staff has been very attentive to us even though we always sit on the patio. My husband and I are always on the look out for places we can bring our black lab Jack along for dinner (we hate leaving him at home). So this place definitely fit the bill! Sometimes however we find if you sit outside the level of service is seriously decreased. That is not the case for Big Dog's! After one of us simply notifies the hostess inside that we'd like to sit on the patio they typically have someone come right out to attend to us. 

I absolutely love that they constantly have new brew lists and highlight not only their own brews, but also plenty of local guest brews. My husband and I are big beer lovers so it's nice to have a place that's open 24 hours so close to home. I've tried a number of their in house beers and have never been disappointed (love their black lab stout, though I may be a little biased!). I've also enjoyed every guest brew I've tried as well. 

Now on to the food, which is absolutely delicious. Seriously. They serve breakfast all day in addition to plenty of bar food and grandma's style cooking. This last time I tried their pot roast, and it was fall of the fork good. Loved every single bite. 

So if you love dogs, beer, and good food you gotta give this place a try!"}
{"text":"First off, I'm from Wisconsin, so I was SUPER excited to try this place! I had the Walleye, which I have not had since I left Wisconsin. The fish tasted very fresh, and they managed to pan fry it without drying it out, so I was pretty stoked. The Sweet Potato fries left something t be desired, they were thin cut waffle fries, so they lost all their sweet potatoes goodness. I tasted the beer cheese soup, even though I don't tolerate dairy, I had to have a bite of someone else's just for a taste of home. It was delicious! Highly recommend if you like dairy. 

Fried Cheese Curds.. even when I lived in Wisconsin, I have always felt frying a cheese curd was sort of a defilement of something beautiful, so I am not a good person to ask if they were any good. But they were there, and others in my party seemed to enjoy them.

Overall, everyone in my group loved their food, and it reminded me of home. I loved walking around inside and seeing all of the Wisconsin Badgers, GB Packers, and Wisconsin license plates. It was all very exciting, I loved it. 

Extra points for having a pet friendly patio and nice waitstaff, and great beer! This was a definite must stop, and I am glad I don't live near enough to go there a lot, because I would get very fat!"}
{"text":"The Draft House never fails! Always great service, good food and awesome selection of beers! If you get the chance to visit and love good beer, swing in! Say hi to Robbie, bartender with great hair, and gives great blow jobs!!!

Thanks Robbie!!"}
{"text":"Great beer. Great food. They make some solid staples (Peace Love and Hoppiness, Leglifter IPA, and Tailwagger are my faves), but also some sublime seasonals (I wish I had enough calories in my diet tonight to try The Blacker the Berry the Sourer the Juice Blackberry Sour Stout). And if you have half a chance treat yourself to the fried cheese curds."}
{"text":"Big Dog's Draft House is one of our favorite places to stop for a family meal.  We like it because we can go there with our two kids.  The food is consistent, and the wait staff is usually attentive and upbeat without fawning or getting too personal.

We went again yesterday, and the menus were all new.  It seems that the food is the same but some of the prices seem higher.  We probably won't be able to visit as often as a result.

Yesterday my husband had the Tex-Mex burger, which he said was great, and one of my sons had the sliders with onion rings.  I had the pulled pork sliders and sweet potato fries.  

As usual the food came fast, we never had to wait for anything like water.  There was plenty of food and we needed a take-home box.  The stout beer and root beer, both brewed on site, was really nice.  

All of the food was terrific except the sweet potato fries. Last time we had sweet potato fries at the Big Dogs on Sahara, they tasted like sweet potatoes.  This time, at the Draft House, they tasted like nothing except the powdered sugar they sprinkle on top.  They were completely flavorless.  The mustard dip was great, but I was hoping to be able to taste sweet potatoes.  That's the only thing that prevented this from being a five star rating.  I'm sure we'll be back, because we like the place, but I don't think we'll order the sweet potato fries again unless  they make a change there."}
{"text":"Good beer, good prices, great ambiance. Nice place to have a beer and watch a sporting event. Always a place to sit even when they are busy. Friendly staff with a welcoming atmosphere. Nice place to hang out for a few hours."}
{"text":"Food is decent. Nothing special, but certainly edible. We liked the cheese curds. Service was good. Server was definitely friendly even though they were busy. Be prepared, though.....it's loud!"}
{"text":"Well, for one, I am a Green Bay Packer fan.... but that's not why we're here are we?! Great pizza, burgers and salads! The brewery brews some of the best beers ever and the seasonals are exellent. Brats are awesome and you can get a burger with brat, hamburger and a pretzel bun! MMMMMM!!!"}
{"text":"Love this bar, no place like it! Amazing beer, great foo, friendly staff who always remember you and wonderful atmosphere. A great place to catch a big game and enjoy hanging out with friends or to just get a meal. I'll miss this bar when I move to Reno."}
{"text":"Best Huevos Rancheros in the city. I've eaten this dish all over Las Vegas for several years now, but ate breakfast for the first time at the Draft House, and OMG it was the best. I highly recommend this restaurant for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Good eats."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere. Never had a bad experience here. Always recommend to anyone asking for good food in the area. Sara the bartender is very nice and friendly. Good conversation. Golden Tee machine is a huge PLUS. Keep on keepin' on"}
{"text":"Driving by this place, week after week and hearing so many positive things about this place, my wife and I rolled into Big Dogs with pretty high hopes.  It just seems like the kind of place that you can roll up your sleeves and dig into some great food, maybe throw $20 into a video poker machine and relax with some friends over a few pints.

However, the bar staff was ridiculously rude and greedy.  There was one bartender for forty or so guests around a massive bar.  Every time a manager was called to the bar to answer some complaint about service or food or both, they would ask her if she needed help.  She would look around the bar and say \"nah its not so bad\" and then continue to give terrible service.

I ordered some type of brat-burger sandwich creation that I thought was going to save the experience, but it turned out to be a hotdog pretending to be a brat.  At least they did have a fresh pretzel roll to hide the hotdog.  This place seems like it could be awesome or has been awesome, but I just missed it completely.  The twice fried or twice dipped wings were incredible, by the way!"}
{"text":"This is a fun place, and, if I lived in Las Vegas, I'd be back again and again.  It's a micro brewery with a Wisconsin theme.  I'd never heard of such a thing, and so it seemed interesting.

Let's start with, \"They are not afraid of a fat gram.\"  This place served fried cheese curds.  Ponder that for a moment, and know that our group loved them, along with our other two appetizers, onion rings and buffalo chicken wings.  A great start to a meal.

We were there on a Friday, and so they had a fish special going on that one in our group enjoyed, it was a member of the 'all you can eat' variety, and he only had one plate.  He was full.

I enjoyed the fish taco's made with walleye.  Very appealing presentation and the sauce was good.

Did I mention the beer?  They had a variety, and all in our group were happy.

They've got beer and they've got good food, what else does a sport fan need on the first night of playoff baseball?  That would be TV's, and they've got a bar full of them, and they've even overflowed into the room where they are serving dinner.  Would my wife approve of this, absolutely not, but she's not with me, and so all is good.

Again, if I lived remotely near this place, I'd be back, but probably not with my wife."}
{"text":"I love Big Dog's. Their menu is extensive. My boyfriend and I have tried several items from their menu and have never been disappointed. When my parents are in town we always go to Big Dog's at least once. My dad is a picky eater but loved their pizza and French fries. I also like the ambiance. We've never had a bad experience in several visits to Big Dog's."}
{"text":"90 minutes for 3 people to get breakfast... It took 20 minutes to get our drinks and an hour for our food. The beers we tried were good and the food was solid but based on the service I definitely won't be back to this location. It was not super busy and there was plenty of staff and we couldn't see what the extreme delay was all about."}
{"text":"This has been one of our favorite places for many years but our favorite appetizer has been removed too bad no artichoke dip"}
{"text":"Comfortable place where you can bring guests from out of town and know they will have good food, and a good beer. 

My husband and I go here often. The bar area service is why I deducted a star, the last 3 times I have been there and sat in the bar area the service has been extremely slow. In their defense, I was recently there on a Friday evening during a NCAA tournament basketball game. 

The soft pretzels are good, and great price during happy hour.  The cheese soup, and the nachos with shredded beef are worth a super long workout to negate the calories.

Burgers are good and you can get veggie burgers (Boca patties) even though I don't believe it is listed on the menu. My fave is a build your own on a pretzel roll, with green chiles, pepper jack cheese, and guacamole....I've gotten this combo with beef burger, turkey burger, or a veggie burger depending on my mood. 

I was sad to learn on my last visit that one off favorites - the Mediterranean salad - was no longer on the menu. If anyone from Big Dog's reads this, I know I have spoken mostly of the delicious food porn options you offer, but more often than not i ordered that salad- please bring it back! 

Digressing...make sure you sign up for their free loyalty club for coupon offers and loyalty points. Sit in the dining room if you are bothered by cigarette smoke."}
{"text":"This place is so close to where I live, I can't help but going there two or three times a month.  They have the best bar food I've had in Las Vegas and their beers are top notch.  Unlike many of the chain bars in town, their blue cheese dressing seems house made along with the house made pot roast served as an entree, tacos or on a sandwich.  

Economically minded patrons will appreciate the regular coupons and Big Dogs rewards card to save on the dinning budget.  Beer aficionados will appreciate the Big Dog offerings of, not only their house brews, but a great selection of other top notch microbrews."}
{"text":"Big dogs comes with a little bite.

This place is okay for the following reasons.

Came with a big party of 9, and didn't feel like our server gave us the attention we deserved. Especially since we we're leaving a bigger tip since we were a BIGGER party. 

Next, the food was mediocre. Nothing special yet the prices we're a little higher than expected. Burgers tasted the same as carls or dennys. The only thing that made me jump for joy were the cheese curds. Mmm. Sound so disgusting but taste oh so good. 

If i came back it'd be for the old cheese fat ;)"}
{"text":"The new menu is amazing! Great vegetarian options and as always good beer. The Sweet Po was so tasty and great variety of flavor. Fries are always tasty and the Walleye Tacos were delicious. Grilled cheeses are next on the list of things to try. Local place with fun atmosphere and close to home. Great spot to take in a game and the patio seating is nice."}
{"text":"The draft house has always been one of my parents and my favorite places to go. Usually great food and service...  Granted this was a Friday night and it was hoppin' but we spent over 2 1/2 hours and were seated immediately.  Our server didn't take our order for close to an hour, a manager finally came to check but she had just taken the order. Too bad that's the only time she checked on us!!!

Once the food came out we never saw her again until the bill came. Even then it took 10+ minutes to get change!  I think I saw her tending to 5-6 tables in the dining room PLUS the private party in the silo. Really poor staffing!!

Hate to say, the food was definitely not up to its normal standard.  Even my dad mentioned that the food was sub-par and he never complains!

I don't see us coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"4 of us ate there late in the evening. There was nothing special about the atmosphere. Pretty typical of a sports bar type place - jerseys, license plates, other odds and ends decorating the walls. It was freezing cold in there. Usually we welcome nice cool AC int he middle of Las Vegas summer, but this place was like a fridge. All of us in our party were freezing. We had to move to a different table that was not under ceiling fans.

The food was just average. We had nachos for appetizer. The portion was good, but nothing special about it. Looked like just a pile of chips with some cheese sprinkled on it and microwaved. Some of the cheese wasn't melted. Whole dish was just luke warm. For entrees we had club sandwich, fish and chips, and a southwest melted sandwich. All of it was average bar food. Nothing outstanding or signature about any of the dishes. Service was decent. All of us had that I ate too much greasy food feeling when we left. We probably will not go back there. Food was not worth the price. So many other options out there for better food and better prices."}
{"text":"Came in tonight on our way home and hoping for pizza, which we saw on the online menu. However,  when we asked for a menu, our bartender, poor guy, had to jot down the limited menu options on a beverage napkin because they do not provide him a printed late night menu. I can say as a fellow bartender, how can you possibly expect your staff to give great service if they don't have the basic tools to do the job?? He did a great job, all things considered but I don't know that I would comes back here to eat late night again. The bartender is awesome, but should at least have something printed to present for a menu. I would come back to see him for drinks,  but that's prob it. Give your staff a little support and they can do a much better job for you."}
{"text":"We have been here several times for the beer festivals! Were were at the Summer Beer Fest last night. It was probably the most busy I have ever experienced. The line and wait for beer sampling was longer than I can remember ever experiencing at any previous beer fest. 

Good people and good times. Maybe we just got there too late, we got there at 7 and usually get there at the start (5pm). So many of the beers that we wanted to sample were already tapped out. :(. It was still a great time. We met some fun people while waiting in line. The music/band was AWESOME! 

Definitely a good time even though we didn't get to try the beers we wanted to. The other options were just as tasty."}
{"text":"Beer's good, atmosphere is good, service is good, food...yup...good.  Really isn't anything not to like. Always ask what the food special is. Smoking and non-smoking section.  Awesome military discount."}
{"text":"The food was great! I couldn't believe the size of the portions...the staff was accommodating as well. Their beer is also something worth trying!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times.  Good place to eat, reasonable.  Wisconsin based foods!  I am from the Midwest, enjoy the food and beer here."}
{"text":"I love Big Dogs Brewing! I am a die hard Green Bay Packer fan, and there is no better place here in Vegas to catch a Green Bay game than here or at home. Big Dog's is as close to Lambeau as you can get here in Vegas on game day. The food is good and the service is top notch. This place is so awesome I'm willing (and have) to ride the bus for 45 minutes to get here. Great atmosphere, great service (usually), outstanding beers, and good food."}
{"text":"Favorite place for trivia or to watch a knights game. The food is delicious the grilled cheese is a must. Beers are great. Bar can be Smokey but they have a smoke free restaurant side too."}
{"text":"Go for their hoppy, flavorful, excellent beers, stay for the best bar food in the Valley.

Big Dog's is nothing special to look at- typical bar environment, TVs, Wisconsin themed sports memorabilia, etc- but the food is surprisingly delicious. At Big Dog's an order of wings isn't just fried and covered in anonymous sauce, they're \"twice baked\" and seasoned with zesty Cajun dry rub- Amazing. I've tried half a dozen entrees and everything has been flavorful and tasty. Portion sizes are decent as well.

Big Dog's is a great gastropub- both the food and beers are a quality draw. Paired together, they elevate this is place to killer. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Yeah !!! Last Sunday when I was there for breakfast, I was told that they brought my favorite salad in Las Vegas back. I forgot the name, but it has a raspberry dressing, blue cheese, sweetened nuts, and chicken."}
{"text":"Mixed review, it's ok, I go here...sometimes. Good selection of draft, their own brew and guest taps. I like to drink local and spend my dime on local wares whenever possible. Having said that, last time I was here the place was nasty smoky. Yes, nasty.

It was a Sunday and the football crowd was still here after the packers game, rooting, gaming, definitely smoking up a storm and drinking their bud. Don't even get me started on going to a brewery and ordering a bud bottle. That might just be the definition of insanity. Anyway, maybe it wasn't the best time for a nonsmoking, beer enthusiast to patronize this establishment. I take some of the blame, but I looked around this bar and I was not part of the majority demographic monopolizing the polluted air space. 

I'm much better served coming here in the warmer months. Sitting outside, away from the smoke, maybe bring my dogs along, which are more than welcome. Or earlier in the day, through the week even. But the weekend, during American \"football\", watching people swill their bud, puff their stinking cigs, all while filling their faces with fatty bar food. No thanks."}
{"text":"The food always tasted good however they seemed to stop washing their glasses. We have now coined a phrase when something smells bad...we say, \"Smells like a Big Dog's cup\"."}
{"text":"After being seated by a young host who mumbled something about drinks then walked off to never come back then sitting for over 10 minutes and being ignored by no less than 7 different servers who walked by us, we walked out. Since we've been here twice before and the food is always just average (extremely boring menu) don't think we'll be back. What a shame since there are not too many breweries on this side of town."}
{"text":"I love The Draft House. My grandfather helped erect the horse statue out front many years ago. He would frequent the bar before I was born and had many friends there. He said it was the good 'ol local bar with a \"Cheers\" feel. Since then, I've grown up and have visit The Draft House on my own for GREEN BAY PACKERS football games, breakfasts and to meet with friends for a drink. The breakfast menu is diverse and you can sub fruit or other sides for things you might not like. The staff is helpful and the bathrooms are clean. Get there early on Game Days to grab a table."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's a small piece of the Midwest right here in Vegas. They have cheese curds and fish fry on the menu and Packers on the tv. What more could you want? The food here is a very good quality bar and grill style. I've had burgers, wings and ribs and they're all good. They also have one of the best craft brew beer menus in town. They always have seasonal things on tap and are constantly updating their taps. If you love beer and bar food this is a must try."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and friendly service.  First time visiting but not the last.  The menu was easy to navigate and our waitress was very helpful when asked for suggestions.  We had the sticky garlic wings and porky pine pizza, out of this world!  Next visit I need to try that ruben sandwich with pale ale sauce!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, people and selection of beers. My only gripe really is the beef stroganoff with egg noodles. Those noodles are really very flat and messy! Would be better to have another type that doesn't easily slip off your fork.....and even though I like mushrooms, they clearly outnumbered the beef.
That's my beef really!!"}
{"text":"From out of state and this place was recommended. The brews are fantastic.... love the tailwagger, which we tried first in AZ. Had the Kale Steak salad and highly recommend. We even saw a small bar fight next to us that was taken outside. The food and brew was so good we decided to not fallow."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat! I probably come here about once a week and I'm never disappointed. Their menu is vast and their staff is excellent. I recommend trying the smokin porky pine pizza it's delicious."}
{"text":"Big Dog's Brewery. A local's joint on Rancho, just north of Craig. 

Awesome prices for the \"home\" brews. Industry prices for the guest pours. Great service by the server. Attitude by the busperson. Maybe he needed a drink or ten to wipe the scowl off his face.

Bar food. Not bad and not bad pricing either. Gaming at the bar and lots of fun placards with witty anecdotes plastered on the walls. 

Fun place."}
{"text":"Had the beer cheese soup, onion rings, Wisconsin cheese curds, brats, everything was great and the staff was good, great experience!!"}
{"text":"OPEN 24hours
HAPPY HOUR 4-6PM everyday: 2$ off draft in house brews and some cocktails
I have to agree: THIS PLACE LETS YOU SMOKE INSIDE and it is the first thing that you notice. It is sooooo overwhelming and I swear this was illegal to be smoking inside restaurants, but who know Vegas is all kinds of backwards. This place is and always will be a divey,casual sports bar. Large bar with casino style electronic card games, larger indoor and outdoor seating area which seats easily 200+ people (maybe 150). 
Came here on a Friday afternoon around 5pm. Was seated immediately. First thing I noticed was how cheap the cocktails were esp the MULE style drinks 6-7$: vodka, bourbon, whiskey, tequila styles. DEF RECOMMEND
Also the drafts include an IPA, Stout, Ale, etc. I had the Stout- it was a stout- nothing special- dark and chocolately. 1 glass- 4-6$. 
For food: Cheese curds- 3/5 recommendation. They just seemed like breaded mozzarella sticks and if you don't eat them within 5min, they get super hard and close to inedible. The sauce that came with it was a ranch sauce and then there was this grotesques what I could only describe as: jalapeno, horseradish flavored stuff; At first it was like a creamy taste but then as you swallowed it, there was this sharp bitter flavor. Do not recommended this sauce.  
Next time I come here will def sit outside when it gets a little warmer. THE SMOKE SMELL WAS A HUGE DETERRANT."}
{"text":"Well, this place is extremely chill on a Saturday evening, and though we didn't get to try the food, well the beers are real good! IPA, lake mead monster, even Pilsner, so good!"}
{"text":"If you are into beer, and I don't mean the fizzy yellow stuff, then you have to visit the Draft House!  Big dogs brews some of the best beer I've ever had.  It easily compares to Stone, Pizzaport, and is better than Dogfish Head.  Two particular beers that they brew, Alpha Dog (a double red ale, 8% abv), and War Dog (IPA, 8% abv) are just incredible beers!  Try the bullocks IPA, or the Dirty Dog IPA if those are not available.  

The food is standard bar food, but with a higher quality than most bars in Las Vegas.  The Cheese Kurds are so awesome, and all of the sandwiches are really good too.  The fries are great, and the service is always top notch.  

I am a big fan of Draft House, and a big fan of their beer.  Check out Beer School, and their other events with live music and special guest brews like Pizzaport and Stone."}
{"text":"I am so, so, so sad that I did not try this place sooner. Looks are totally deceiving and i totally admit to thinking I was too cool to drink beer in a corny place designed to look like a barn. This place is in my backyard,..I can see it from my bathroom window and up until a few month sago avoided it like the plague.

A  few months ago a co-worked coaxed me into meeting her for a few beers here, so I gave in and drove across the street. The first thing I noticed upon entry (since I'm from Chicago) was the sickingly amount of Wisconsin/packers/ badgers signs and memorabilia. Oh great, I thought...not only am I drinking in a barn, but a cheesehead barn...lol (chicago folk loathe all wisconsin teams). Anyhoo... on to the food and drink,  I ordered cheese curds, a tall  tailwagger wheat brew and a full order of nachos..OMG is the food good...and the beer tastes like a midwestern weiss (my fave!) then came the 20 lb plate of nachos, I thought that was a mistake or a joke, the full plate of nachos could seriously feed 6 people. Then the bill came..surprise, SUPER CHEAP.

So now I absolutely love this place and eat & drink here at least once a week. My newest addiction here is the potroast sandwich. I LOVE this place...if you haven't tried Draft House , you don't know what your missing."}
{"text":"One word for you people. Just one word...BRATSEL. This belly busten bad ass beast of a burger will wreck your world.  Forget everything you thought you knew about burgers because this thing is reinventing the wheel.  1/3 lb burger patty, smoked bratwurst, applewood smoked bacon, cheddar & swiss cheeses, fried onions, lettuce, tomato and topped with, the holy grail of all buns, the pretzel bun.  The burger comes paired with a pickle slice and fries. Our waitress came by to offer me a box and to her horror discovered nothing but crumbs.  She fumbled over her words quivering at the lips....how...how did...did you eat the entire. I took it upon myself to quickly cut her off and reply with,\" yeah bitch, I'm an Fing bad ass\". OK maybe that didn't happen but I did clean my plate and had wet dreams about it for nights to come. Wash it all down with one of their award winning micro brews and you'll find yourself on cloud nine.

I love this place and you should to.  Great atmosphere, punctual and friendly wait staff, good down home cooking, and one hell of a happy hour.  Go to Big Dogs, catch a game and pound some beers.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Overall I like this place.  The beers are good and the they give you large portions (which any respectable manly man looks for in a draft house.)

The food is a bit inconsistent.  I had an excellent steak a few weeks ago and last night it was just OK.  Almost seems like they used a different grade of beef.  The host may have been a bit slow or off his game, but he waited for me to ask for a table before saying anything.  Doesn't seem like a big deal, but if you think about it, it can get awkward fast.

The beverages are always good though, so if nothing else go and try the house brews."}
{"text":"Las Vegas Brewery tasting Tour stop number 2.  I give this one 5 stars because it is also a Packer's Bar during football season.  Being a Cheesehead that's a PLUS.  However the Dirty Dog IPA is top notch for sure.  Not only does it have a decent Alc % but the flavor was very hoppy and flavorful but had a very smooth finish.  I am not sure the IBU on that beer and I do not think they had it posted but this beer was very easy to drink.  By the looks of the beer menu Big Dog's had over a half dozen beer's made in house from all varietals of beer styles.  

Food menu had some great choices of hearty stick to your bones dinners like Pot Roast.  Also to choose from were a great selection of burgers patty melts and Wisconsin's finest sausages from Klements and Johnsonville Brats.  I will be definitely trying one of these on my next visit.  Reading the menu I can envision a pile of gut busting goodness of grilled onions, peppers and links slathered in mustard.  Ah, but we will conquer this dish next time.  I chose the \"Draft House\" burger which came out of the kitchen quickly and cooked to a perfect and juicy medium just like I requested.  I paired this monster with the waffle cut sweet potato fries that came out dusted with powdered sugar.  This burger was no Joke! I am sure it was a 1/2 lb with cheddar with thick cut crisp bacon, LTO and grilled mushrooms.  Awesome!.  That burger was no match for me that day.  

You can look at the magic happening while they are making the beer from inside the bar area with the windows looking right at the fermentation tanks. Big Dog's has several seating areas including a bar, restaurant and patio area.  During football season it is almost impossible to find an empty seat in the Dog House.  Packer fans come out in droves to support their team and sip pints of Big Dog Brews.  Once in a while they host a beer festival on property showcasing all of their fine Suds.  Big Dogs is a must try on my list of Brewhouse stops in Las Vegas.  I recommend visiting on a Sunday while football season is in full swing for an amazing fanatic experience.  Unless.... your a Bears fan."}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving four and not five stars is that their food is a little pricey compared to similar establishments with comparable food, however it is absolutely delicious and our waitress was very friendly! We had the spinach artichoke dip to start, hands down best spinach artichoke dip I've had in years! I had the Big Dog's Salad, which was awesome! It's shredded lettuce with Cajun chicken, corn, cheese and this very tasty chipotle-lime dressing. My boyfriend had the Breakfast Bratzel, which is basically this epic  bratwurst sandwich, topped with eggs, and served on a pretzel bun. I would highly recommend and will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong Tuesday special beer and ribs. Less one star for the smokey atmosphere in the family dining area . Kids love the deserts always a plus ."}
{"text":"Another successful night Dogtoberfest, what a blast! Great food, awesome brews and all my beer friends can't wait for January. ...Well done Big Dogs!!!"}
{"text":"They have a great selection of beers here. Food is always good. Seems like they have a lot of beer festivals / tastings. Good place to hang out and watch a Vegas Knights game."}
{"text":"Authentic to it's theme, I love the brats and burgers  and really nice brews. No complaints about this place."}
{"text":"When I lived in Vegas, this was my place for drinking great beer. The beers brewed on site were always of good quality with lots of local microbrews on tap as well. The food prices were a little bit steep but the food was always good and tasty. Those looking for a place to hang out with Green Bay fans will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times to the bar area to see bands, etc and have always had good service. Tonight I came with a party of 6 and we were quickly seated in the nearly empty dining room. They came for our drink order fast enough and then we waiting at least another 30 minutes in an empty restaurant to order our food, even though our server seemed to be just wandering aimlessly around the restaurant. It was about another 40 minutes before the food actually came, tumble weeds were  rolling by. The food itself ranged from the beer cheese soup ( excellent ) to a few different burgers and a fried chicken special. The food was all above average but the wait just killed the experience."}
{"text":"I would give this place 4 stars for their unique brew of beers and the atmosphere, however I had to subtract a star for the poor quality of the food. Overall, I like this place and I'm willing to give it a second chance even though I didn't have a slam dunk first impression. I'm optimistic  that I'll be able to eventually find a staple dish that I'll love, but bottom line is that I'd come back for the beer. 
What to avoid: The Wisconsin Walleye- I ordered this dish to be healthy. So I got the steamed version. It was supposed to come with a lemon glaze? Which was non-existent. The fish was completely bland with no flavor, and my first bite of the fish was full of bones. So that was a huge disappointment
But this place can definitely offer a good time- chilling with your friends, drinking some beers, and munching on the Bavarian pretzels! The pretzels are awesome- super soft and salty served with a honey beer mustard dipping sauce. Can't go wrong there."}
{"text":"This was an oasis this morning - I am on east coast time, and this fun little place is open 24 hours...and serves great beer to boot!  I wanted to try some of their appetizers, and if i were here longer that just today, i likely would have gone back for dinner! :) However, it was not in the cards, for this time, i had a great egg and brat dish.  Try it!"}
{"text":"(6/29/18) Went back to give them another chance and had a great time. Good food and service. Also, their Blacker the Berry sour might be one of the best I've had.

I've been going to Big Dog's Draft House for years. Just consistently good food, beers were always great and the service was fine. The past few times though, the food seemed old, overcooked, not fresh or just plain bad. I don't know if they've changed hands recently or they are cutting back. This past Sunday (7/17/16) I took my visiting brother (from Boston) to show off some of the great places we have here in Las Vegas. He was underwhelmed, to say the least. Not wanting to over-eat because of a big dinner, we both had the Big Dog salad or Signature salad? Not sure what it's called. Anyway, this dome-shaped pile of completely wilted lettuce and slime came out. I was pretty embarrassed, as I should have been. I didn't want to make an issue out of it, but neither of us finished and we left. 
Someone else in our party got a plate of your wings which seemed like they were cooked and recooked so many times they meat was dried and pulled away from the bone.
The cheese curds were great, thanks for not screwing that up.
Come on guys, get it together. You used to be great and consistent, don't let your customers down!"}
{"text":"Big Dog's has stellar beer, decent food, fun festivals, frequent live music, and fair prices. If you live on the north side of Vegas, this place should be a staple.

Big Dog's rotates a wide variety of home-brewed and guest taps and I can always find something great on the list. They also will give you a taster if you need. The food is based on Wisconsin favorites and includes options like bratwurst, cheese soup, macarconi and cheeses, and burgers. The menu has something for everyone though, as it also has salads, quinoa salads, ahi tuna, korean fajitas, and tons of other things that are atypical to find in bars. Ive been pretty happy with everything I have ordered, especially the bratwurst pretzel bread breakfast sandwich! Yum!"}
{"text":"Read reviews so we were pumped to try this out with our kids! Sadly we were extremely disappointed. 

My kids got chicken fingers which were nasty bland and just ugh. 

My husband got the post roast sandwich which was ok but nothing outstanding. He tried the sweet potato fries which were cold. 

I got the philly which was a mess! I asked for no peppers which came in abundance. Took it back and brought out basically an onion sandwich with little to no meat. Disgusting. 

The only thing I liked was their outdoor sitting area. Lots of shade, fans and great little outdoor eating area. If you take younger children or you have issues with smoke, I suggest you sit out here. Indoors is more casino and bar style although they do have a few tables on one side as their restaurant. The smoke from the bar/casino is definitely heavy throughout even in non-smoking areas."}
{"text":"Big Dog's Draft House is one of my fave places in Vegas! The only reason I don't give it a 5 star rating is because I smell like an ashtray when I go home. It's difficult for us non-smokers here in Vegas if we enjoy eating and drinking in bars. Oh well!

My husband and I eat here frequently and love the food. Comfort food... lots of cheese, meat, and potatoes. They also have wonderful specials at night, like all you can eat shrimp on Wednesdays, etc. They have delicious craft beer made on site and we love the wait staff, including the bartenders. All in all, one of my fave places in Vegas!"}
{"text":"My husband, kids and I came here yesterday while visiting Las Vegas. After our oldest daughter passed out from heat exhaustion, followed by many hours in the ER, we wanted to make sure we got lunch that she (well, all of us) would enjoy. We all loved this place, including youngest child (who is very particular). My husband did his homework, and we ended up here. 

Cheese curds- ridiculous. I need these in my life more often.

Husband- Brewer's Sandwich. Bratwurst, another type of sausage, grilled onions, sauerkraut. (I told him he was going to have to get himself his own hotel room.)

Oldest daughter- cheeseburger, lots and lots of water, and a house brewed root beer. 

Youngest daughter- kids' mac & cheese (Kraft from the box, but she loved it).

Me- the Cheesehead burger. Being a huge Packer fan, I had to get this. 

And, speaking of the Packers, this restaurant/ brewery is full of Wisconsin paraphernalia, but more importantly, it's full of Packer stuff!

Now, the beers. Dirty Dog IPA, delish. Double Down (double) IPA- delish. Husband got the Double Down, but it's a 9% beer, so I only had a sip. We did get a flight also- cream ale, Imperial IPA, double IPA, stout, and a peach. The cream and peach were okay with, but the other three beers in the flight were wonderful. 

Service was great and everyone was friendly.

My only complaint is... why can't this be 200 miles closer to my house?"}
{"text":"Wish I could give ZERO stars!! Absolutely horrible service, will not be back and will not recommend. After waiting ~20 minuets just to get a glass of water (which we never received) we walked out. Our server blamed the kitchen for being backed up however, she should have been hustling that much more to make the customers happy."}
{"text":"Stopped by a Thursday night so pretty slow  wasn't expecting much but man the food was amazing I had a burger with sliced brat, the atmosphere was nice chill nice people bartender was awesome let us sample a few beers before we made our choice I had red dog wich was good for me but to strong for my wife she had their hefenwizer wich was good too def be back"}
{"text":"If you haven't tried the cheese curds, you are missing out. They are the best. We get those with the leg lifter beer. 
If you like garlic. Get the garlic fries as your side instead of regular fries. You can never go wrong with the bratwurst."}
{"text":"I went specifically for the curds and left sufficiently happy.  Bonus that it's also a Packers bar."}
{"text":"I've passed by this place a ton of times, but never had to chance to check it out until recently.
I met a few friends there for Sunday Night Football last week, on their recommendation. 

The place has a pretty cool set up. Large bar when you first enter with tons of TV's set up everywhere. We decided to all grab a bite while we were there, so we headed to the back to a dedicated dining area. The area in teh back is a bit quieter, with tons of TV's set up as well.

Service was okay. Nothing spectacular, nor anything horrible. Could have been better. Could have been worse. I wanted to try one of their brews, but unfortunately their \"Leg Lifter\" light beer was out. I opted for the Dirty Dog instead. It was alright. 

I ordered a Cheesehead burger with fries ($11.50). The burger was pretty good size, but kind of dry. The fries were nothing special either. They reminded me of Jack in the Box fries.

Basically everything was just okay. I would probably give this place another chance one of these days, but it's not very likely since I live on the other side of town. 

I wavered between 2 or 3 stars on this one, but I really want to give this place the benefit of the doubt...so....

3 stars."}
{"text":"My all time favorite bar TY and Noah are mine and my boyfriends go to bartenders. They know exactly what we want when we walk in. Anytime we try a different bar we immediately regret it. CHEESE CURDS here are phenomenal exactly what a cheese curd should squeak and taste like. Best Wisconsin bar in town. Service = fast , accurate , quality when coming to big dogs"}
{"text":"Brand new outdoor patio on this place is cool Thursday nights is live music.   Great beers and the sell growlers too"}
{"text":"Wonderful pretzels and good food in a fun environment.  Cold beer to boot!"}
{"text":"Just a good old fashion sports bar.  

QUICK NOTE - I know it's Vegas, but why is smoking still allowed inside restaurants and bars? I mean it's 2016 the Rat Pack hasn't been relevant for over fifty years. Can we please stop this? There's nothing worse than trying to enjoy your meal and a plume toxic smoke invading your space, you might as well eat in the toilet. That being said...

Beer time after skating my heart out at Crystal Palace, I came here for a post birthday party drink and snack with the birthday girl and her friends. This place is surprisingly big with plenty of tables, TVs and bar space to hang and sip a beer. 

The menu is pretty much what you would see with any sports bar, chicken wings, burgers, brats and deep-fried everything. Although the one thing that stands out here is the cheese curds, deep fried little nuggets of cheese, battered, fried and served with horseradish sauce. I dare you to say no! 

I went with Chicken Fingers, swimming in buffalo sauce and an order of French fries. I ordered the appetizer serving size and it came with six chicken tenders, spicy, crunchy and plentiful, really the perfect dinner option. The beers were good, but tasted pretty much tasted like something you'll get from Gordon Biersch or another chain brewery. I went with the Dirty Dog IPA it was good, but like said before nothing that really blew my craft beer taste buds away. 

The three stars are for slow service, mediocre beers, and cigarette smoke in the air. Guys, can we just create a separate smoking area or just have people head outside. 

It's really quite simple."}
{"text":"Stopped in here because it looked good from the street and we were hungry for some dinner. It's a big, loud, boisterous place, but certainly inviting.

The menu is fairly basic meat and potatoes combinations, though there are interesting twists. The beer selection seemed slightly narrow, but the red ale (Hydrant, I believe) was actually exceptionally tasty.

I got the brat platter with sweet potato fries and garlic mashed potatoes. The brats were okay. One of them tasted like a basic hot dog, which sucked. The sweet potato fries were very good, but I really could have done without the powdered sugar. The garlic mashers were also quite good. The portions were fairly large and I wasn't able to finish everything.

Overall, this seemed like a really cool place and the beer was quite respectable. It seems like one of the better restaurants in the North Las Vegas area. Definitely worth a look!"}
{"text":"Big Dogs is near my office, so we've gone to happy hour a couple times to celebrate one thing or another. The beer and drinks are pretty good. Don't expect the waitresses to know any fancy mixed drinks. The food is pretty good as well with decent, but not phenomenal, happy hour prices. I've had the nachos, artichoke dip, and burger with sweet potato fries.  All were quite satisfactory. Several of my co-workers have gotten the rib special (I think on Tuesday nights?) and they were very pleased."}
{"text":"I usually go to Big Dogs for dinner with my husband but this time I went with some girlfriends for lunch.  I saw someone eating the taco salad and it looked so good I ordered it and it was better than it looked.  My friends had the club sandwich and they both said it was delicious.  The food is consistently good and so is the service."}
{"text":"Best place in town amazing food, Incredible service, the manager Josh had great beer knowledge!! the bartender Robbie has pretty awesome hair!!  and was super quick with drinks!  I cannot think of a better place in Las Vegas!!"}
{"text":"I love the craft beers at the draft house. The pot roast sandwich is awesome. The bartenders are great to except for Tyrone. BAD ATTITUDE. That's the only thing wrong with that place is Tyrone."}
{"text":"I became a regular here, although admittedly I dreaded going sometimes because the cigarette smoke filled atmosphere is slightly unbearable. I'm a tough cookie, and Big Dog's holds a special place in my heart because they do beer, food, and service really well. That deserves my business everyday.

The beer is pretty good. I stumbled upon the local/craft beer scene and the city of Las Vegas royally sucks for anything besides Budweiser products. I love every menu item I've tried. Cheese curds! The twice baked wings are delicious, and they even have veggie burgers :-) Great menu, overall.

Service here rocks. I never sat at the bar, but always at a table next to it. I've had a few different waitresses, all superb. My beer never was less than a quarter full before I was asked for refills, and no matter how long I sat there drinking the service was consistent. Five stars, if a smoker didn't always sit right next to me."}
{"text":"They have great food, a great atmosphere and I even won a 50 dollar gift card on a whim when I took my date there. Thanks guy."}
{"text":"Big Dog's is your typical American restaurant with an above average beer selection. If you're looking for somewhere with a large variety to satisfy a group of people this is a good choice. They have a beer list that includes their own brews as well as guest taps and the standards. They had 3-4 sours on tap the day we went in. The restaurant is very dark, especially near the entrance. There's a huge bar in the center and a more formal dining room towards the back. They also have shuffleboard, Big Buck Hunter, jukebox, and plenty of TVs. I saw a group that had just finished a tour of the brewery so I guess they do that too. 

I had the \"Ultimate Wisconsin\" grilled cheese. There was a ton of bacon in this, making it extraaa greasy. I was not a fan of the sundried tomatoes. They were really hard so if you bit into one you had to pull the whole thing out and eat it or set it aside. Fresh tomatoes would have been a better choice. My coworkers agreed their meals weren't anything special either (pot roast sandwich, philly cheese steak and patty melt). The food is nothing special. I may come here for a beer but that's about it."}
{"text":"It's a neat restaurant and has friendly staff. I had a bad experience when I was younger eating here by choking, so I can't really review it properly. The only thing I can say is that they didn't charge me for my meal. I appreciate them making light of a traumatic situation."}
{"text":"I'm sure the last time we will be back unless we get a free coupon or something and maybe not even them.  Slow, inattentive service and still too smokey.  The only reason we still came was there was one good bartender and we liked the beer and the wings but unfortunately the poor management or ownership does this place in. All the bad reviews I see pretty much say the same thing too. You'd think they would read them and try to improve???"}
{"text":"Best craft beer in town ! The food is pretty fair. Staff is awesome ! Plenty of guest taps. What more could you ask for ?"}
{"text":"Good Specials.
Beer Fest.
Very friendly staff.

Depending on times can get busy, but always will make room for you.

Great for getting together."}
{"text":"Service was excellent, but they forgot to bring my bacon! (Cardinal sin!) Bloody Mary is tasty and they have good Vodka. The food was \"okay\" at best."}
{"text":"I've visited this place on and off since the late 80s.

The food has always been great!

The bar is owned by a family from Wisconsin and the food menu reflects that. You'll find plenty of brats and cheeses and their walleye is excellent."}
{"text":"Great selection of micro brew beer.  They have a 10 + percent alcohol IPA which was unique.  There stout was a step up from others I have tried before.  They had a raspberry beer that had a taste just like biting into a fresh raspberry: amazing.  The Packer and Cheese-head decor was a bit off-putting, though."}
{"text":"Meg in the bar rules she is why we would return burger and beers were amazing"}
{"text":"Very good beer, not great, but very good!! Some top notch IPA's are created here, and the care and attention to detail in the brewing process shows in the finished product. The other beers are damn tasty as well, but the IPA's are the stars!!

The food is good as well, that is not a hot dog on the bratzel burger genius, it's called a smoked Brat!! You can order it with a beer brat instead, and it is a thing of beauty!!

The cheese curds are just ridonculous, but pricey!!! One of my favs is the pretzels with a bowl of the cheese soup, dip the pretzels in the soup, Yummy!!!

My thanks to Las Vegas Beer Tours for introducing me to all of these wonderful brewpubs in Las Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"Went to Draft House for dinner with the family not thinking about it being St. Paddy's day. When we arrived we were prepared to leave but decided to see what the wait time would be... hostess said it would be 20 to 30 minutes due to a family of 11 before us ( I mentally added 10 minutes for the just in case ) so we decided to since it would take about the same amount of time to go somewhere else & eat we chose to stay. After 45 minutes and at least 4 - 5 other parties being seated before us when I inquired with the manager was told that we she didn't have a table big enough for 6. Once seated the busser was prompt in taking our drink order & he was quick to get them, we ordered an appetizer at that time with him, the waitress finally came by our table to let us know she had put that order in and it would be out shortly we did not get the opportunity to tell her we were ready to order so we had to wait another 20 minutes for het to come & to  take our order. All total it took 30 minutes in between ordering & getting food orders. Did not get refills on drinks. Food was not the best ( have had worse but have had much better ). By the time we were ready to leave I had to go track down the manager to get our ticket to pay. She did apologize for making us wait to be seated & did discount the meal ( which was considerate of her ). I did tip the server but if she would have been as attentive to us as she had been the big table seated after us her tip would have been better. When it is busy we do take into consideration when evaluating our service that we receive and do try to be patient, unfortunately even keeping those things in mind and have been loyal customers of Big Dogs in the past I am sorry to say that dinner today has fallen way short of what we used to have. Still not sure if we will go back, time will tell.0"}
{"text":"Big Dog's is awesome. We live nearby so it's a great local hangout after work or just whenever. Food is excellent. My family being from wisconsin, I can't get enough of the cheese curds and brats. Ty the late night bartender is cool, always willing to suggest new beers and a great guy to chat with. The staff is willing to let you sample their beers if you want to expand your beer palate. I've never had a bad experience there. Definitely a gem."}
{"text":"The food here is top notch! Great, elevated bar food. Tried cheese curds for the first time. I had been missing out! They were incredible! Also had the Smokin' Porky Pine and it was one of the better pizzas I've had in Vegas. I LOVED the crust. 

Maria was an amazing server! She was fun and her smile was contagious. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This review is for 3.5 stars.

I came to Big Dog's half because I like trying new beers and half because they were hosting trivia.  The trivia side of this post will be short because it was not great.  They segregated the trivia player's into a corner of the restaurant and the acoustics were just awful.  You could barely hear the questions and the area had about 8 tables pushed together so there wasn't much room.

Still, the main review is about the beer.  I did not have food, but i certainly tried some beer.  Bg Dog's has the most extensive selection of self-brewed beer in the city.  Their Big Dog IPA is very highly regarded (I concur), and their imperial stout is actually very underrated (and very high in alcohol content) as well.  

For the beer, please come to Big Dog's.  They usually have some deals with some of their beers and give them great sales prices for the night.  They also have many guest taps in the restaurant.  The beer selection is actually quite good in terms of numbers because Big Dog's brews about 20 beers, in addition to the 10-15 guest taps.

My biggest complaint is that they do not put prices on their beer list.  If you ask they will tell you the price (they said most were between $5-$7) but one of my biggest pet peeves at bars is when they omit the price so that deducted a star on its own."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant when you want some stick to your ribs type of food. Nothing disappointing here. Try the cheese curds. Get two orders. They're that good. The in house beer is not bad either."}
{"text":"The first time I came here the food was really good although the service was 'meh.' The cheese curds were great and my burger and fries were delicious. The beer is also good and they have many varieties. They forgot to bring out the cheese curds until after my meal was served. 

However, the second time we came here we sat outside. There were 2 other tables outside and the hostess told us we could sit out there. After sitting out there for 10min without seeing anyone I went inside to get menus and inform the hostess we still hadn't seen anyone. We waited another 10 min before leaving. I went to tell the hostess why we were leaving and she didn't say anything except, 'oh, have a nice night.' I wasn't happy with the lack of caring at all. The food and drinks are good and I would like to come back here in the future if the service improves."}
{"text":"I love this place and go all the time. Great drinks, great prices, great food. Their nachos are the best I've eaten and they are HUGE. Chelsea is my favorite server because she always remembers exactly what I order. Took a friend from Wisconsin there and he confirmed it's absolutely an authentic Wisconsin bar! Owner and managers are great as well."}
{"text":"Last night was great!  Perfect for drinking with friends, family and your little dog too!  Really cool vibe...listening to live music and nachos with everything on it topped it off!  

My first time...definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"We were out in the Northwest on our haunted house expedition, and decided to stop in because we hadn't been here in years. It was kind of late so the restaurant area was closed. I HATE sitting at barstools, but they had this weird sort of option of sitting on really tall padded benches against the wall. Slightly more comfortable, but the Anaconda said he felt like a little kid with his feet dangling.

Got the bacon cheeseburger with sweet potato waffle fries. Burger was well cooked and tasty, and the hot, crispy fries came with a thin, sweet dipping sauce that went perfectly. Baby Sis got a house specialty sandwich with bratwurst. She said it was good but I can't personally attest since I didn't actually get a bite. She never was good at sharing.

Service was fine- friendly staff who seemed a little overworked. Pleasant vibe- they played a lot of classic rock mixed with country hits which seemed to cover the customer base pretty well. (About half of which were chatting and happy while the others were hunched over the video poker machines in their own private hell. I feel your pain.)

Now for the part that, for me, lost them their fourth star, but ironically, made the Anaconda and Baby Sis want to give them 5: they let you smoke at the #@$! table! WTF!  Am I the only one who recalls a law passed not that long ago that prohibited smoking in food service areas? What the hell ever happened to that??!! 

They sat there dreamily puffing away, declaring that it was such a treat not to have to go outside for their post-meal coffin nails, that this was their new favorite restaurant. I wanted to call the police."}
{"text":"Probably the nastiest place I've ever ate at. Service was god awful, food was downright disgusting, atmosphere was louder than expected - honestly, I would just drive by this place. Definitely the worst restaurant I've eaten at, and not trying to bash on them, but the quality of the food as well is not as good as other pub joints... rather spend the money somewhere else."}
{"text":"4 stars for the beer and the atmosphere. Some of the best beer in Vegas. Otherwise, I'd give it a 3. Often slow service. And it is average bar food at best."}
{"text":"Last night was National Burger Day, so naturally, I demanded a date. Being that we are new to Vegas, we use Yelp for pretty much everything. We landed in this place, and I was not disappointed.

I had the Draft House burger with garlic fries. It was to die for. The burger was juicy, drippy, and perfect. Slathered with two huge pieces of applewood smoked bacon, carmelized onions, and sauteed mushrooms, it was a huge success. The best part was the melty, gooey cheddar cheese. I can't say enough about how amazing this burger was.

My husband had the green ghost burger. It came with avocado and ghost pepper jack cheese. It had a substantial kick, and definitely hit the spot. We decided that combining the two; a Draft House burger with jalapenos added would be the ultimate success. 

Garlic fries were garlic-y and delicious, perfectly crispy.

I'm not currently drinking, due to health reasons, but I tried their home-brewed root beer and it was divine. I almost took a growler home of it. 

I'd absolutely recommend the restaurant side of this place. The bar side is way too smoky to be enjoyable. Service was a little slow, considering they weren't overly packed.

We'll be back, for sure."}
{"text":"Haven't been back in awhile..... Very impressive wait staff... Chelsea is phenomenal... Service was exceptional.... Nice changes outside... Too bad it's so hot outside that we could not sit there... Food was very tasty ... Most definitely will be back!!! Highly recommend..... Great beer!"}
{"text":"Great brats, cheese curds, ya-da ya-da...fantastic beef stroganoff.  Landing spot for Wisconsin folks who love the Badgers and The Packers.  Fun brewery with good food, often entertainment.  Bring friends here when they visit.

Now they even offer a breakfast, they were always open but you had to stick with beer and brats.....now brats and eggs!

Note:  Almost impossible to get in when the Packers are on, bring your cheese head!

Only gave 4 stars, cause I know they will keep on improving!"}
{"text":"Awesome sports bar / brewery. All of the food on the menu we've had has been delicious from pizza to burgers to French dip sandwich. Great beer selection including the Big Dog's beers - watch out for Underbite...it's a BIG single IPA that drinks easy. Trouble!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite stops for a bite to eat and a drink.  The nachos are the best I've found in town so far. My other top choices are the cheese curds, the Bratzel, and the grilled brat platter. I'd also highly recommend a side of potato salad. They have good beer and their seasonal beers are even better. Also be sure to check out their rotating guest tap menu."}
{"text":"I'm being generous with 3 stars because the service was awful. The beers were lackluster as well. They were apparently out of half the drafts on the menu. However, what would make me go back were the fried cheese curds. O M G! Talk about a home run!! WOOOOOOOW. They put mozzarella sticks to shame! The bavarian pretzel was very good too. The artichoke dip was ok. I've had much better. The place was dead when we went and the waitress was horrible.The portion sizes were huge. The artichoke dip came with carrots and celery, texas toast, AND chips. The cheese curds appetizer fed 3 people. Wish we ordered a second one though, they were THAT GOOD! I wouldn't recommend the place based on service and beer though."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years. I love the consistency of the food each time. I do miss the brown bread loaf they used to bring toy our table!

I ordered the \"Cobb Salad\". It was delicious and huge. I was able to eat the rest for lunch the next day. The avocado was fresh and very yummy.

Our server was nice and checked on us often. The place was clean as well the bathroom.

I like all the quirky signs they have around and their pride and love for the Green Bay Packers. 

The \"Cheese Curds\" are a must try at least once.

Parking can be hectic but they do offer parking all the way around and have 3 different doors for entry/exit. 

You can choose to sit in the bar area or in the dining room area."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great local craft brewery. They do a lot of music stuff too including an open mic on Sundays and live music on the patio on Thursdays. Patio is also dog friendly."}
{"text":"Beer is awful. If you like mediocre brewed beer, this might be the place for you. The packers fans are nice though, nice enough and aren't annoying. Also, don't use the touch tunes, they shut it off whenever they want or don't like the song."}
{"text":"Holy smokes you must try the cheese curds! It comes with ranch and horseradish dips. I think the horseradish dip is a great pairing. I had the bratzel and my wife had the pot roast dinner. Both were amazing. The Bratzel is a large sandwich with great flavor."}
{"text":"I've been going to Big Dog's Rancho location for a little over five years. Their beer is good, and the food is not bad.  Like a lot of places, it depends on what you order.  Tonight I had their Friday Fish Fry Special.  It was catfish, and it was OK.  Definitely fresh and not fishy or soggy.  I just prefer a crisper crust. The cole slaw was eh - better than a lot of places, because they make it themselves, but it was over-dressed. Their fries were not that great. Just average, not seasoned, not that hot/fresh. 

I always like the service. Even when they are busy, they are still pretty on top of things and are friendly.  I wish they would close off the bar more, because it is smokey. 

Their brats are good, and the beer cheese soup is also very good."}
{"text":"I took my daughter and wife her for lunch. I ordered a Salad with Chicken Breast and Balsamic Dressing. The salad was good. The dressing was a little strong. My daughter ordered the Club sandwich and she said it was OK. They were a little skimpy on the meats. My wife ordered the Chicken wrap. She said it was excellent and there were no issues with her meal. The waitress was very upbeat and positive and even suggested menu items for us. My drink was always full and the service was excellent. A little pricey for lunch. The entire meal for 3 was $45.00"}
{"text":"One of our favorite place to get a good beer while watching the football game, although a green bay packers place, I was able to catch the Broncos, 
Great food and excellent customer service, sometime we'll have the appetizers and a drink or a full meal, definitely one place to keep going"}
{"text":"Service was great! Our drinks never ran dry. I got the fish and chips. Fries were tasty. Fish wasn't bad. My husband got the Ol' Smokey burger and it was delicious! We came during hockey playoffs and the atmosphere was awesome. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Good bar food that is well priced. Only downfall is the awful service. Walked in the door and stood at the hostess podium for 10 minutes before anyone one even acknowledged us...many servers walked by and made eye contact and would walk away but not a single one acknowledged that we were even standing there...not a single \"hi\" or \"someone will be right with ya\". Finally one of the servers said she would go find the host...when the host finally came out instead of acknowledging the 2 people standing in front of her, she decided to pick the phone up instead and ignore us some more. So the server that went to get the host saw this and said she would seat us instead. We sat down...she took our drink order and brought it out promptly. She then took our food order and left. Then the waiting began again...10 minutes...20 minutes...30 minutes and still no food. So when the food finally came out we were starving. Boyfriend had the rib special and I had the bratwurst...both were tasty! We finished our meal and we still have yet to see any sign of our server since the food was brought out. When she finally came back to the table, we ordered a dessert to-go...boy was that a mistake cause here comes the waiting game again...we waited another 20 minutes for the dessert came out before we could go home. Awful, awful service all around."}
{"text":"Big Dog's is a place I like to head to if I'm on the North Side of town. It's got a huge bar with plenty of sitting. The beer has always been good and the food is just as killer (don't forget to order that delicious Bavarian Pretzel)!

I'd recommend stopping by if you want to play a quick game of Golden Tee, watch the game, get some good beer, and enjoy part of your day!"}
{"text":"Let me tell you a little something-something about this place. Their appetizers are great! Their menu is great! Their brews are great! Only downfall is that we had to wait a while for our orders, but it's ok. Lucky my friends and I had time to catch up for our food to come around but we were all pretty hungry. Their servings are BIG, crazy big but we loved it. Would love to come again, just hope the wait isn't that long like the last time."}
{"text":"Looking for a great place to have a beer and watch a game off strip?
This place hits all points, I went last year during football season looking for a brewery to watch the game. 
I tried a good amount of the beers, all of them are great however I would like to see them kick it up a knotch and branch out more hops more malt.
Food specials during the game all over the place, service was great."}
{"text":"This is another classic 3.5 stars but with this one I have to side on the 3 star side. 

The staff is a little below par for the price level in the restaurant. I have been here twice and once the food was good all the way around but the next time I wasn't impressed. 

I have had the Cajun wings and a hamburger here. We asked about the Cajun wings spice level and were told they weren't spicy don't let them tell you that, they are! The hamburger is just ok nothing really to write home about either way. 

The staff just wasn't trained enough."}
{"text":"Quality but nothing really worth writing home about. Decent beer and decent food with good service."}
{"text":"This is an awesome local business! I had both food and their craft beer and I must say both are pretty tasty!! Any time they have Italian Grilled Cheese on special, do yourself a favor and try it. It blew me away.
I'm a lager or stout person.  I tired both and I can't get enough. Especially their stout. So delicious! The only thing is that they don't can their stout (as I have been explained they don't do it for many reasons). 
I guess I'll just have to drive all across town to have it.  Lol

Great brewery! 
Support local!"}
{"text":"I met a new friend here before we went to a show. They were having a beer festival and it was great!! I am not a beer drinker but am finding that if you know the right people who know beer it isn't bad at all. Tom was nice and between him and my friend I found a beer I like. After the show we came back to listen to a great band, drink more beer and eat a delicious brownie sundae. People go here to have fun for sure."}
{"text":"I was looking for a breakfast place and saw the rating for Big Dog's and had to write a review-- no idea how it received a 3 1/2 star rating.  We've been coming here for years.  I don't think I've ever had anything bad on the menu.  From the braetzel burger to the salads (how many bars have salads that are good?!?!) this place is fantastic.

The appetizers are one of our favorite items.  The cheese curds... beer cheese soup... not a great place for those who are lactose intolerant!  

The beer itself is also good.  It was one of the first local breweries to serve craft beers.

Now I'm not going to lie- the bar is a smoke field and the bathrooms are well, bar bathrooms.  Because IT'S A BAR!!!  If you want fancy, go to the Strip.  If you want delicious local food in a super casual environment, come here.  

Love, love, love this place."}
{"text":"As a Wisconsin native, I had to give this place a try and i was not dissapointed. Cheese curds were on par with what you actually get in Milwaukee! Cant wait to watch Packer and Badger games there when the football season starts!"}
{"text":"Been going there over 20 yrs.  The Brazelburger is phenomenal."}
{"text":"The draft house is your typical bar, that looks like your parents farm house up state but It's allot bigger than some that I've been to and nicer looking. You can see the Brewery from a wide clear glass window and they have a good variety of beer to choose and a food menu to satisfy your late night cravings."}
{"text":"Big Dog's took away breakfast for a little while since my last review and then our favorite waitress left. Luckily they brought breakfast back but it hasn't been quite the same since. Lots of little changes, some for the better, but it just hasn't been the old faithful it once was. Still a great place in my book and maybe with some more visits it will return to the 5 stars we once knew."}
{"text":"Big portions for an amazing price. we stop in everytime we come to vegas"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was good. Service was reasonable but, food was very bland. I even ordered a special. I upgraded my regular cheese steak to a southwestern style but, still was very plain. I won't be visiting again."}
{"text":"I have been coming to the draft house since I was a little kid lonf before Big Dogs came into the picture.

1. Food here is great no matter breakfast, lunch or dinner. The Walleye is great and the brats do keep me happy. Did I mention the Cheese Curds??? BOMB!

2,  The beer here is great as well...one of the few local breweries we have  and one that didn't let their beer go straight to crap when the big hops shortage went down and the economy dipping. They also rotate some other brews from other micro breweries including other local ones which is a classy move.

I must add that I am a Packers fan so I do haunt this place on that note as well."}
{"text":"Everything you want from a Wisconsin Beer Mecca without Mosquitoes.

Went here on a Tuesday (Ribs night!) with some friends. No ready seating at the bar so they seated us in bar overflow. I thought this was going to be BS because we were not in the bar. Not so, the bar overflow is open and adjacent to the bar, features a large quantity of sports-tuned televisions, and has a waitress bringing you their glorious beer so all was well.

Food: Had the 9.99 ribs and fries. Really decent for a non-rib joint. Spectacular at 9.99 and consistent with the food I've had before- nothing exceptional just really well done classics and unusually good fish choices. This is not a gastropub, but that doesn't mean you won't leave happy and full. Prices are solid.

Beer: These guys make the best beer in Vegas. The brewery is on site and they actually have quite a lot of great Big Dog beer on tap here at all time. Considering the size of the operation they must run those things night and day. The guest taps are also spectacular: well chosen regional standouts and usually on tap. They also regularly have gatherings for new beer releases and they have consistent enough quality to make the trip always worth it.

Service: our waitress Shannon did something I have yet to behold here in Las Vegas. She split our check, and not only that, she did it happily, voluntarily, and without us asking in advance. I had not seen the like since I was in the Midwest (why is it they hate splitting checks out here?) She was great otherwise, but this was top notch. 

Pro-tip: If you come here in a Bears Jersey they're probably going to take you to the back and play \"Abu Ghraib\" with you. Otherwise an amazing place to watch a football, especially a Packers game."}
{"text":"The  house  brews  here are awesome! I had the what gose on in Vegas stays in Vegas the dog gone and the Las Vegas lager all three were pretty damn good.  To eat I had the nachos with shredded beef , they were pretty good."}
{"text":"Great selection of beer!  I was just there for a quick lunch and to pick up a few bottles to go. The service was excellent and the staff were all very friendly. I sampled 3 beers of different styles and enjoyed each of them. Food came out quickly and was quite good. 

I will stop by there again the next time I'm in town and go for dinner and drinks."}
{"text":"We went in here just because it was super close to our hotel, and whaddya know - a Packer/Badger (UW) bar in Vegas? Hot darn!

I'm probably being a bit critical on the three stars here but it didn't quite round to 4.  The food was good but not amazing.  The service was average.  It was loud as hell and I could do without the smoke in the bar area.  

I had a sirloin steak and my friend had fish/chips.  The steak was done correctly, not fatty, and the sides were decent.  At $17, whaddya expect.  My friend said his was good as well.  In the end, I wouldn't rush back but it definitely served the purpose."}
{"text":"Came here with our kids at 10:30 at night on a Tuesday for a late night dinner. Even though the restaurant side was closed, they let us sit on the porch/patio. I thought maybe we would have to order food from the bar, but someone still came out to take our order and bring the food out. Excellent service as always, food came fast, hot and delicious. Kids especially enjoyed having the porch all to ourselves so they could dance to the music still playing! :)"}
{"text":"Heard from @Dan P that they just tapped a batch of War Dog last Thursday....so I made sure I stopped by for lunch as soon as I came back to Vegas on Sunday.  Brought Mom's with me for our traditional Sunday lunch....we were staving and couldn't wait to get seated.  The Draft House is a Green Bay Packers Bar.....so it was packed with Packer Fans on the bar side....not one available seat or table.  It was 3 pm and the Packers vs Vikings game wasn't for another 2 hrs, but it was packed to the hilt!  We got seated in the dining room area, our server wes named Apple, seriously.

After browsing the menu for a few minutes, we asked Apple if there were any specials....she proceeded to tell us about a bunch of Appetizer Specials ($2 off) and $2 off for the War Dog during the NFL Games, so we took her up on it.  We ordered:

- 1/2 Order of Nachos $7.50
- Bratwurst $3.50
- Jalapeno Stuffed Pretzels $5
- NFL Hot Wings (10 Wings) w/Chipotle Sauce....their hottest Wing Sauce $6

To wash it down, we both ordered Water and I of course ordered a 24 oz War Dog!  ($7.50, $5.50 with the special) The War Dog was freakin' awesome.....not as Hoppy as I expected based on @Dan P's report, but it was very good.

After a short wait, we got our food....Nachos first.  Mom and I attacked those Nachos.  They were pretty good....topped with Sour Cream, Cheese, Guacamole, Olives, Jalapenos, Salsa, and Onions.

Next up was the NFL Wings.....I jumped on those next....damn, they were awesome!  Very Meaty Wings.....the Chipotle Sauce was just right....had that Smoky flavor and was just Spicy enough for me and Mom.  The Ranch given to us for dipping went well with the Wings.

They brought out my Bratwurst next.....I added some Mustard and Relish and went to town on it.  It came with grilled Onions topped on the Bratwurst.  It was pretty good....although the Bun wasn't all that.  I would have preferred a Roll or Italian Bread instead of a Hot Dog Bun.

The last item to come out was the Jalapeno Stuffed Pretzels.....they were piping hot and moist and doughy.....delish!  They came with a side of Nacho Cheese for dipping.

It was at this point that Mom and I figured out that we ordered too much food.  I wasn't going to let this place defeat me though, so I pressed on.  Mom said she'd finish the Nachos and I would handle whatever was left of the Wings & Pretzels.

We took our time watching the Seahawks vs Cardinals game and finished our food and Beer.

When Apple delivered our check she said she made a mistake and gave us the food specials for Monday Night Football, not Sunday....but that the restaurant was going to honor the specials anyway because of the mistake....is that great service or what?

Overall, great food & great service.

Will I return?  You bet!"}
{"text":"it's underrated. should be a 4. food is good, beer is great. come here for the tap. everything else is a bonus."}
{"text":"This is a really fun Midwest bar, and their beer is pretty great. I enjoyed their fish and chips, but was so disappointed that I didn't get the garlic fries. Their garlic fries are amazing! Been here a couple times with larger groups and they've always been really accommodating with splitting checks and multiple arrival times. They also have a discount for teachers!!"}
{"text":"Excellent house beers!  We loved both the beers we tried, and the prices were also low.  The menu offered a great selection of meals, including many vegetarian options, such as build your own pizzas, and veggie burgers.  The sweet potato fries were good, but the garlic fries were honestly the star of the meal!  We loved the outdoor semi-covered seating, which even featured a TV.  We wish we had room to try the bread pudding.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is a great location to grab a quick bite to eat or to hang out for a spell while drinking an in-house brew, eating a leisurely meal, watching sports on TV, listening to music, dancing or just shooting the breeze without needing to spend a fortune to do so.

Both a seated dining option and an expansive bar area are available for your personal enjoyment in this comfortable, cozy and large facility which looks a bit like a Midwestern barn on the outside.

A comfortable, casual ambience prevails here. No need to get all dressed up, come as you are anytime.

The owners of Big Dog's Draft House on Rancho Drive originally hail from Wisconsin (just like me) and have been in Southern Nevada for many years now. 

They used to have a small brewery on the Las Vegas Strip called the Holy Cow Casino and Brewery many years ago. I still remember the coupons for free pint glasses of their pumpkin beer.

The likely German ancestry of the owners may explain the delectable, reasonably priced morsels that are always available here including bratwurst, an abundant variety of oversize sandwiches, diverse entrees, mouth-watering deserts, beers and much more. 

The available food specials in the evening hours change by the day of the week, the season of the year and the owners' preferences or inspiration. 

All you can eat seafood items such as shrimp, fish and the like are a recurrent then as are annual beer festivals such as the Summer Beer Fest and Peace, Love and Hoppy-ness which always draw a crowd due to their very reasonable pricing.

This location is also just a hop, skip and a jump from other fast-food options such as a Fatburger, Wendy's, Arby's and more. But if you are at the one and only Big Dog's Draft House, you'd truly be a fool to go anywhere else!"}
{"text":"We love football here!!! Food is pretty good. The atmosphere is fun and casual. Our servers are nice and keep the beers coming. I love the draft beers.  They have something for everyone.  It is a Wisconsin bar."}
{"text":"If you're going to come here - enjoy the beer and the brat & bean soup on a Saturday Night. Sit at the bar and enjoy the people watching. If you're super hungry, the ribs are okay.

DO NOT use the bathroom. DO NOT get the food, especially the garlic fries. DO NOT expect decent service - but expect an overly priced menu. We accidentally spent $50 here thinking it would be worth it - it was not. We ended up grabbing Dominoes pizza 2 hours later. 

The food is so obviously frozen, and the waitress we had was rude. She gave us the 'What do you want.\" attitude - I typed that correctly - it's like it wasn't even a question, like we were disrupting her. There were buckets strewn about the restaurant and bathrooms due to the leaky roof succumbing to the rain, and the it just all felt dirty. 

We won't be back. Oh no, we won't be back."}
{"text":"I have eaten here probably three time total. What I do like about this place is the quality. The hamburger patties actually taste like ground beef. The service is pretty good. A burger and some fries about $10-12 bucks. I can easily power down a meal here and not be completely full. Not a bad place I just think they are a little chintzy on the portions.  How about some more fries of something?"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff!  Dave (brewmaster) makes some great beers, and Sergio (chef) creates some very inspiring dishes!  

Don't miss their beer festivals!  Always great music, great food, and a lot of great beers!  Makes for a fun evening every time!"}
{"text":"The food was ok.  Service is very slow.
It was over an hour and half before we were served. The waitress was
nice and apologetic at first but as soon as I asked \"did they forget our order\" she seemed
like she was avoiding us once another waiter finally served us our food. I think she forgot
to put our order in. I get it that restaurants get busy but for me to have to ask and ask is not very professional. She didn't check on us. We had to waive her down to get the check and give her our money. We felt like she just kept trying to avoid our table after I asked her if they forgot our food. 
I won't go back and won't recommend. I work in the industry so I will make sure I spread the word that this place is not so great at customer service."}
{"text":"great beer and good selection
smokey
bartenders could be a tad bit more outgoing and friendly"}
{"text":"If you're a Green Bay Packer fan come here you will be in great company.

We had dinner with some great friends here and you'll find plenty of yummy pub food plus steaks here.  A great kids menu and a family restaurant area that is seperate from a huge bar that's decorated in tons of Packer memorabilia.

The service was very friendly.  I ordered a few drinks before they got it right I was gratefull they took the margarita and the margarita rasberry \"special\" drink back because they were really strong and not tasty.  However, the Piña Colada was really good.  Shocking right?  LOL The beer I heard was pretty good too.

A great place to have greasy cheesy appetizers and fun food.

Loud with lots of great decor, don't miss!"}
{"text":"My lunch, your dinner.  I really like this place and come here often for lunch (your dinner).  Love the atmosphere and okay/aight food, but the staff is very nice and friendly.  My favorites are the fish and chips or the wisconsin brat."}
{"text":"I've been a semi-regular to regular attendee of the place since it opened back in the late 80's, and its certainly had its ups and downs in that time period.

Speaking for now, I consider it to be my \"home\" bar and rarely have an experience that's not positive.

The beer here is phenomenal, and they always have a great selection of craft brews that they make on site. No matter what you're in the mood for, there's always something there you'll like.

The food is almost always good. A lot of standard American fare, with some Wisconsin style dishes like their fried cheese curds (mandatory whenever you go there) and walleye. Their burgers are always great, as is pretty much anything else you get there. The only thing I've eaten there in recent memory that didn't really get my approval was their prime rib, which was very....okay. That's not a normal thing on the menu though.

Service also generally good, especially if Emily serves you. She's one of the best out there and will always make sure you're well taken care of. The other servers there are also mostly good, though some occasionally disappear for longer than you'd like leaving dry glasses when you want another round.

The environment is very welcoming and down to earth, but by no means trashy or low budget. Being a Wisconsin bar, there's tons of Green Bay stuff decorating the walls. If you're a Bears or Vikings fan, you have been warned. In terms of smoke, you'll come out of the place smelling like it, but there are plenty of air filters installed so you never feel like you're in a smokey bar.

Lately there's some points against it in that it's been extremely crowded as of late (can't really fault them for success, but as a patron it's a pain), and they've also installed a jukebox which means being subjected to loud, crappy music whereas they've always played classic rock and other quality tunes there (some of which is actually fairly obscure, so a music nut like me would jump for joy when you'd hear an old 70's progressive rock tune that you'd never hear on the radio).

One thing that I really wish they had is an established happy hour. The beers there are a little on the pricey side, and being able to swing by after work some days without a $30+ bill (food and a few beers) bill would be nice."}
{"text":"An old favorite from the 1990's when we lived in Las Vegas, it was a treat to be back in the Valley and in Big Dog's. It did not disappoint.

My wife had the Big Dog salad--huge and delicious. I had the special--sheppard's pie. Very well prepared and properly proportioned. She had beer and I had wine, both delicious. And the table service was thorough, thoughtful, and still casual. 

Highly recomended!"}
{"text":"Yay! I'm a fan of Big Dog's...only if I'm in the area.

At Big Dog's, the portions are just that, pretty big.  Service is always quick to be seated, order to be taken, and food to arrive. Can't give them 5 stars for service because at Big Dog's, they are not the most attentive group.  Once you get your meal, there are times you don't see or hear from a server until your check is given to you.  My suggestion is to do what I always do, order your drink refill early. 

As for the food, it's not bad and the portions are good.

-Sliders: This was recommended on my very first visit about two years ago.  Priced about average (less than $10)' It's still delicious and taste about the same as other pub and grill joints.

-Fish and Chips:  Deep fried and greasy.  Poke a couple of holes in the breaded fish and drain the greasy out first.  Now you're takin'.  Now it's at least edible.  I think the batter is a little too thick and takes away from the taste of the fish.

-Steak:  Not a bad option, but it's a little dry.  However, it's cheap and you get what you pay for.

-Pizza:  Has to be over 2 years since my last pizza here, but it's cheap and one of their better prepared items here.  For less than $10, a personal pizza here is tasty and not too greasy.

-Burgers:  2nd favorite to their pizza.  Their burgers are stacked, juicy, and affordable. 

I never expect much at Big Dog's because the prices are cheap and it's basically pub food.  Portions are big and there's still enough on the menu for everybody."}
{"text":"another restaurant i can cross off my list. for more than a decade, the food has been great. tonight we sat at a table and our guest started rummaging through her purse and the jackass manager runs over and says \"did you put something in your purse?\". really? like we are going steal a salt shaker? wtf? we walked and will never eat there again."}
{"text":"Great bar food in Northern Las Vegas. They make their on beers there and have some tasty selections. I enjoy their honey hot chicken fingers with the ranch dip. They have a great ranch dip there and I think that makes/breaks bar food. The draft house salad is also a great choice for a \"healthier\" option. They give you a heaping amount of salad. Only downfall is if you sit in the bar area, you have the cigarette smoke to deal with while you eat and drink- but then again, that was the Vegas standard until recently"}
{"text":"The food was great, and so was the service.  The entrance at was a bit odd though.  There is a bar entrance at one side, and exit only door in the middle where the hostess desk is, and the restraunt entrance at the end.  My husband had been craving a teriyaki burger forever, and since they have a build-your-own burger menu he was quite happy.  I would go back for sure the service was great and our glasses were always filled."}
{"text":"Great spot off the beaten path in vegas. Seems like a locals hang out so the atmosphere is friendly and the food good and inexpensive. Ill be back for sure."}
{"text":"The beer is fantastic, but the service at the restaurant is worse than before. Pretty sad."}
{"text":"Worst food I've tasted since 1995. Service was terrible and the filet mignon was cardboard. Very disappointed. Will never return"}
{"text":"I'm back! 

It took four years, but they finally brought back the taco quesadilla, much to my delight! Staying true to my word, I have updated my rating to five stars! 

And a compliment to our regular server Julie. She is awesome! She makes sure our group is always taken care of, including setting up tables in the bar for our group, always gives us great service, no matter how busy she is and she puts up with our sometimes obnoxious group!

Thank you Draft House for listening and bringing back my favorite dish!"}
{"text":"I'm not a beer drinker...but this place rocks! Just the decor alone is worth a visit...you feel as if you are in the country, at a local hangout where all the town meets up to have a drink and eat delicious food. The food is fantastic and the rootbeer is absolutely the best I've ever had...the way rootbeer should taste! They have a large seating area in the back, as well as a sports bar in the front. Plus, live acoustic rock on the weekends, which I have yet to try out."}
{"text":"Great food, usually great service, and good prices. We enjoy going at lunch and always leave stuffed."}
{"text":"Big Dog's Draft House has been on my list of places to try for a few weeks now. So, since my boyfriend and I were in the area, we decided to try it for lunch around 3PM. We got lost on the way there. For some reason, the address on GPS took us to the residential area behind the Draft House. Anyway, not really a big problem, just had to drive around the block. 

So, we were greeted and sat in the dining hall. It had a super \"homey\" feel to it with all the barn house decor. I loved it. It looked like there was one waitress that was managing the few tables that were in there during that time. She was very nice and helpful in deciding what we wanted to order. She also checked on us appropriately and gave us information about their rewards program. The food took a little longer than expected to arrive, but that wasn't a problem since we were killing time, anyway. 

I ordered a beer flight, Wisconsin beer cheese soup, and lobster mac-n-cheese. All were phenomenal. Let's talk about the beer cheese soup. It was literally one of the best soups I've ever tasted. SO good. My boyfriend and I were fighting over the last spoon-full. I would come back for this soup alone. We are still talking about it a day later.

Mac-n-cheese is actually a lot more difficult to perfect than one would think. It's not just noodles and cheese. This place did it right. I opted to add the smoked ghost pepper jack cheese to my dish. It was the right move. I love anything spicy, so it added the perfect flavor to the pasta. There were only a select few pieces of lobster that I could find in my dish, but that didn't detract from the meal. 

The beer flight was really good. I had a hard time choosing my favorite beer. Usually, in a flight, there is at least one beer that you know you don't like. I liked them all in this flight. The flights also came in this really cool swirl holder. Definite points for presentation. 

Overall, I was extremely satisfied with the entire meal. I will be back, for sure. My only complaint is that it's a bit far from my house! Thanks for great service and amazing food!"}
{"text":"I passed this place up on my way to the movies and thought I'd come back to check it out after the flick. I'm definitely torn between 2 and 3 stars for BDDH and here's why.

I had ordered Hefeweizen beer, red bean soup and sliders that seemed like a good idea at the time. Everything was great until my mini burgers turned into a cheese nightmare...seriously. 

When the sliders came out they were cold, overdone and the cheese wasn't melted, which made for crappy tasting sliders. I politely asked my waitress if she could just warm them up a bit so the cheese could melt and she didn't seem too thrilled about it.

The second time around the sliders came out with melted cheese.... but this time they had tripled the amount of cheese which I didn't ask for and it was just gross. At this point I could continue with what will end up a rant review so I'll just get to the point.

In a medium size nutshell my bill came to $29 tip not included in calculation for cold food, slow and poor service from waitress and management. So this experience for me means it will have to take a miracle for me to come back."}
{"text":"We went there for drinks after dinner. Drinks were good, patio was awesome. Inside is a little smokey but fun atmosphere. Will definitely try again for food."}
{"text":"Decided to step out and give Big Dogs Brews a try. The service from Ty the bartender was awesome and bonus it's a Greenbay Packers bar. Definitely would come back!!!"}
{"text":"I gave this place a try with family in town due to the relatively high rating and it's proximity in the Northwest part of town.  In all honesty I was a tad bit disappointed with several parts of the visit.  Although I intend to give this place another try in the future; this initial review is only 3 stars.

Positives
1) Beer selection is robust and includes a large selection of beers brewed on sight.  I tried their triple IPA and it was outstanding; beware of the high ABV though, my goodness I think it was close to 12%!  Our party also tried their Hefeweizen and pale ale and were pleased with the flavor and finish.
2) Food menu is outstanding and has options from Fish & Chips to sandwiches to burgers to pizza.  I recommend the Mac N Cheese with Sausage, simply incredible.  Also recommend the pastrami burger and Italian grilled cheese sandwich which was like a pizza!  They have build your own burger and pizza options to allow you to customize your order, always awesome to have that!
3) Outdoor patio seating is available and I recommend this weather permitting due to the smoke on the inside of the bar area.

Negatives
1) Although there is a smoke free dining room, the smell of smoke was still prevalent.  With my wife being an ex-smoker this was difficult to enjoy the experience.  Similar to casinos with smoke free areas, people walking through a smoky bar will undoubtedly bring some of that smell with them.
2) Service was underwhelming.  It took more than 5 minutes for someone to acknowledge us once we entered and waited by the host stand.  Again standing in this area was smoky and uncomfortable.  Once seated it took another 5 minutes for our party to be offered a drink and obtaining refills was inconsistent.  On a positive note the server recommended menu items and all of the suggestions were on the money!
3) Decor is a bit dated.  The place has a Wisconsin theme and is apparently a rabid base for Packer & Badger fans during football season.  I could have done without the plastic ducks hanging from the ceiling."}
{"text":"Cheese curds, beer cheese soup, Smoked Macaroni and Cheese, all so delicious. The cheese curds are just unreal, I could eat an entire order by myself probably. I've never had anything here that I didn't like, however it seems like the prices keep creeping up higher and higher every time we come here. The brats are always done perfectly, I like how they are butterflied."}
{"text":"Food was average at best. Waitress was horrible (Teresa)...never offered refills, confused with orders, seemed overwhelmed!!"}
{"text":"Since I love visiting local breweries while I'm traveling I decided to give Big Dog's a try. It's located about 15 off the Strip/Downtown Las Vegas. This is definitely a place were the locals hangout. 

The owner must be from Wisconsin because you get that vibe going in (for goodness sake cheese curds are their most popular item). I ordered their Holy Cow! Pale Ale. It was good, but I've definitely had better. Same could be said for the Southwestern Steak Salad. Average at best and to be quite honest I was disappointed with the small and dry portion of steak on it. 

Overall, I'm glad I stopped in, but probably won't ever be back. Not a bad establishment, just not my taste."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try this place out after having driven by it many times. We were not disappointed. Our server, Jessie, was very helpful and knowledgeable about their craft beer list. I got the Peace,Love, and Hoppiness beer. It was delicious. My boyfriend and I both got the blackened ahi tuna sandwich. It was so great! All the flavors worked so well together and it was light enough to go with the beer. Definitely will be coming back to check out their trivia night!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and variety of beers!! The live music venues have been fun. We signed up as members, with lots of insensitive. Also great spot to watch football, especially if you like the Packers.."}
{"text":"Not a place I frequent a lot, but I like the place.  Quiet at 3pm on a Tues, not smoky, easy to order.  Wine and beer for meal.   Service was a little lagging after they could tell we were just there for a beverage, needed to go to the bar to get my ticket.  
Not sure if they offer military/first responder discount. 

I last ate here in 2011, and think I liked it.  now that I'm moving into the area, I've been looking around for good food for a reasonable price, and I think Big Dogs has it.  It's a brewpub first, second a kitchen, so keep that in mind when ordering."}
{"text":"Came here with a party of 8 at 6:20 p.m on a Saturday night. Hostess told us it would be a 20 minute wait. Waited over an hour to be seated. Terrible time to come. 

The food here is decent, and the fresh brewed beer is notable as well. However, definitely not worth the time waiting!!"}
{"text":"I had the pot roast sandwich and it is so delicious! The bread is soft and the flavor is delicious.  I am giving four stars due to the restaurant needing to be updated very badly. The food is very good though!"}
{"text":"Here's the deal. It's January 12th at 7pm and the first half of the college championship game and I was denied any service on the patio. I don't know why they would have a dog friendly patio with space heaters and TV's if the hostess is just going to tell you they have no one to serve you out there. Probably for the best anyways as the food quality has gone down hill and the beer prices have gotten ridiculously high in the last few years. Too bad because their beer is actually pretty good. I recommend just stopping in and getting a growler fill."}
{"text":"They have changed the menu recently and not for the better!  The got rid of the pulled pork, which was one of their better items. I settled for a Patty Melt, and was very disappointed. I probably won't be back for a while."}
{"text":"This is one of those classic law Vegas local treasures. First they make have their own brewery,  Second they have incredible food, and third they are a Packers bar, well two out of three isn't bad (JK).  The Sevice is great. Also you get free dessert and 20% off on your birthday. It's worth a trip to the far side of town. Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!"}
{"text":"Wow! What a busy & packed packer backer bar. Ate in the restaurant, sat in the bar & sat outside with the heaters. Had the delicious cheese curds served with a lot of Ranch dipping sauce. The beef stroganoff tasted as it should with soft pieces of meat chunks & shrooms. Could really taste the wine in the dreamy sauce. Patrons are fun & loud. Fun to be here during this Packer-Lions game!"}
{"text":"Heidi is the best!! She deserves a raise!!! Great customer service!! Food was great too!!! I'm a sucker for fries and ranch sauce!!"}
{"text":"I love everything about this place! The food is awesome and they have really great customer service. I brought my mom when she was visiting from California and she loved it so much she won't stop talking about it and telling me she wants to go back. I swear they have the freshest cheese around its so good."}
{"text":"The only reason this place lost a star is because it's a Green Bay Packer bar/restaurant and as a Vikings fan, I can't give it five stars. ;)

The restaurant decor is very Wisconsin, and as a native of Minnesota, I found it pretty appealing.  We went early afternoon, before the dinner crowd showed up, so we had no problem waiting for a table or service.

Our server was a lovely young lady, who also lived in Minnesota for some time. The Wisconsin cheese curds were the best I've had since living in the southwest. They were almost perfect! I had the Cheesehead burger (begrudgingly due to its name) and it was cooked to perfection on a toasted bun.  The fries were really good and the pickle was actually crispy.

The freshly brewed iced tea was also pretty good, and the servers were on top of getting us refills before we realized we needed refills.

Also, they have the Galaga arcade game in the lobby area, that's always a plus for me. :)"}
{"text":"This place is great the Dirty Dog IPA is by far the best on tap. and the WI cheese curds are a great taste of home....I would say for $10 they need to throw a few more in on the portion size tho. all that said, this is a great spot for families as well with a kids menu and separate dining area away from games and smoke."}
{"text":"Ive passed by this bar plenty of times living in the area and would have never thought of it being this busy.

The Hefenweizen was my favorite out of their brews. Dogfish and Light didn't really phase me. I'll be back to try the rest though. The bar itself is huge and seats about 25 people, plus they do partake in Happy Hour.

The only thing keeping me from that's missing is pool tables. At least they have Skee-ball and Pacman right? :P"}
{"text":"I came here to try the beers and get some Midwestern food. Beers were reasonable, $5.50 each for the four we tried. I love sours and stouts, so I tried the Blacker the Berry the Sourer the Juice. It's a sour berry stout! While this one came in a smaller glass than the others (they got pints) I enjoyed every drop. I look forward to their new rotation so we can come by and try some more. Love the labs everywhere, and little touches reminded me of home. They also offer a veggie burger, which I felt was thoughtful."}
{"text":"Still one of my favorite places (reminds me of home) but I forgot to add that they do offer a military discount!

Also, Lady T's Vanilla Chocolate Stout is delicious."}
{"text":"I really like the look of the restaurant as I pulled up.
There were a lot of items on the menu which is good. I ordered the burger. The server was good.
The issue I had was the food. The bottom bun on my burger was soggy when I received it. The burger was bland even though I had cheddar cheese, sauteed mushrooms and ketchup (which I added).  I guess the beef wasn't seasoned well enough.  The fries tasted cold and stale. I only at one.
So the decor was fine, the service was fine but the food was mediocre. Ultimately, I want good food."}
{"text":"Used to be a favorite place to eat for my wife and I until we found a metal screw in my wifes Huevos Rancheros. Dissapointing. I had eaten there for over 20 years. Still a great place to have a beer but I'll never eat there again."}
{"text":"This review should have been more timely, instead of three weeks after our visit.  It was originally written \"in the moment\" and submitted on my phone.  Lo and behold, my first attempt to submit a review by phone, and it went missing, including the draft.  Unlike the meal we had, which settled nicely into our stomachs, the review is floating somewhere in cyberspace.  A re-enactment follows.

It's been several years since we were at the Big Dog's on Rancho, long before my Yelp residency, and I didn't recognize it.  It was conveniently right across the street from the Lumber Liquidators that we'd just been to, so a welcome excuse to avoid cooking dinner was inviting us to cross the street.  Alas, we were about 10 minutes too late for Happy Hour, so we had to order off the regular menu.  Not such a bad thing, since we had a fabulous meal.

After quenching my thirst on my fave, Angry Orchard Cider on tap, I ordered the Southwest Turkey Melt, and Mr. G got the Pecan Crusted Walleye.  My sandwich was absolutely the best, full of stuff, including excellent turkey, and grilled just right.  Normally I wouldn't even have tasted the Walleye, since I try to avoid fried foods. (No, I didn't get fries with my sangwich).  But this one was pecan crusted; mention a nut and I go nuts, so I just had to sample it.  If I weren't so full from my sandwich, I would have inhaled every piece of walleye on that plate.  It was that good!

Service was exceptional: friendly, helpful and mostly prompt, amazing considering it was a weeknight and the place was jammed.  

We are looking forward to going back.  That would have happened tonight, except that I had a BOGO birthday coupon that I wanted to use from a different pub before it expires.  But we'll be walkin' that Big Dog again before too long!"}
{"text":"Great place for local brews. Food is good, and the have great daily specials. The huge drawback for me is there is smoking allowed at the bar. This really sucks. They have a huge selection of house beers, and they rotate often. If you play, they give free beers without any hassle."}
{"text":"If you aren't a Packers fan, avoid the seating area in the bar section by the back door on Sundays. My hubby and i got there early to watch the Lions 10am game and got the center seat. As Packer fans filed in for their 1 o'clock game, we were being watched and lurked and talked about because we were in prime seats. I felt uncomfortable and told my husband we should just leave. As soon as we paid the check, and sat up, one of them came swooping in with his plate. We hadn't even moved away from the table yet!

Other than aggressive fans, it's one of our favorites to go. The food is good and the specials are nice. They're quick with service and friendly. They now also have shuffleboard and skee-ball."}
{"text":"First a rather Interesting bar, brewery and restaurant that transports you back to north central Wisconsin.  The restaurant section is full of great duck and Labrador Retriever prints. If you are a DU supporter, you'll feel right at home. 

The interesting twist is a microbrewery that is out of their main IPA!  Shocked!  WTH?  And this resulted in a rating reduction.  Settled for an initial pint of Red Hydrant to accompany a wonderful order of Wisconsin cheese curds.  Neither disappointed. 

Maria ordered the Wisconsin Walleye and I selected the Mac and Cheese kicked up a notch with the Ghost Pepper Cheese. We ordered a family style Broccoli Salad for the table which was absolutely amazing. A smoky blend of broccoli, red cabbage, water chestnuts, cranberries, celery and sunflower seeds that was perfect!  

Walleye excellent, Mac and cheese excellent"}
{"text":"Great food and awesome staff really love the atmosphere out here. Not to mention as a packers fan thus is the spot to be green and gold covering wall to wall with cheers booming all through gameday. If you dig northern favorites like brats and hearty food this is a great place to grab a bite the food is outstanding and always fresh. If you just want a laid back place to catch a game come on in the waters fine and drinks a plenty. But make sure you get here early cause it fills up quick and the party never stops."}
{"text":"I liked this place. I took my girl here because it was her birthday and she picked it. 

I ordered the bratzel burger.  It was really good. It was gigantic with a really good brat on top. The burger was cooked very good and had a great flavor. It was way too big to eat and super messy, but I still really liked it. I also for the fries on the side and they were hot, crispy and fresh. 

Definitely would come back again!"}
{"text":"Was here 4/19 for their hoppy festival. They had two bands playing inside which was a lot of fun. The Irish band was awesome. 
My boyfriend and I ordered nachos no meat - the reason for my 3 star rating is because of the nachos. The chips were stale and the cheese melted into this hard glue-like substance.  We are them because we hadn't eaten anything substantial all day and we were famished. 

The service was good - the atmosphere was fun. I didn't care much for the outdoor activities but I am not a beer drinker. Overall we had a good time just next time we will stay away from the nachos."}
{"text":"Great first visit with Chelsea as our server. Excellent brews and fabulous times with our friends at Big Dogs"}
{"text":"I really like the food and beer here.  I would have given a 5, but one of there bartenders is an a**hole.  Never had problem with any of the other staff.  For the most part everyone is very friendly."}
{"text":"I love DH .... I love the beer, food and the staff.  The bartenders are awesome, most of the servers are awesome, and the beer is amazing!!  The only thing I  DO NOT like is that they do NOT reserve the machines for players and they will not move anyone that is not playing.  So, if you come in when it's busy (or not) and you want to gamble you're more than likely to not find a machine available.  And no one is going to move the non playing A HOLE  that's sitting in front of a machine playing on his phone!  So we leave and go elsewhere!  Which sucks for us (and them actually) because we'd rather hang out there.  But if they'd rather have non gamblers NOT putting money in their machines but sitting in front of them, then great!  I'll go elsewhere and spend my $$$. And that's what we do now!"}
{"text":"Stopped here with a few others, as we met a \"local: here. Hung-out for a while, ordered some appetizers, and drinks. 

FOOD/DRINKS:
     Ordered a beer that was on their menu, and written on their chalkboard - they didn't have anymore of that kind. Ordered another beer, that they had a photo/sign of in their bar, but they didn't carry that one. So I ordered a sampler of what beers, they did have, and that they brewed. Beer was good.

     Ordered buffalo wings, buffalo chicken strips, and Nachos. The food came out in decent time, the buffalo wings were actually better than expected but the onion rings were on the \"soggy\" side. The chicken strips were a bit under-par, and the nachos were actually good in size and good in quality. 

SERVICE:
     Eehhhh, got me here. Did not get greeted, and it took quite some time for us to actually have a waiter walk up to us, after we even tried flagging one or two down. After that, they did serve us well though. 

FACILITY:
    Parking is great but the place inside is a bit on the older, darker side. The bar had a \"Northwoods Inn\" feel which could be good in ways, but bad in others. Table was clean, and bathrooms were well kept."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints! If you love great craft beer give their Red Hydrant a try. That is my family's favorite. Pair a nice cold beer with their cheese curds. Top the night off by enjoying live music out on their porch on Thursday nights. It doesn't get much better than this.
They also have great brauts and salads."}
{"text":"I come to watch the Packer games! Great atmosphere and they don't talk over the game so you get quality tv time! Awesome WI food items, too! Only wish the place was non smoking so I could enjoy it without walking out smelling like an ashtray."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly, but seemed like they were in a rush to clock out. The menu is small, so if you're looking for a big variety, this is not the place to do it. Ordered a michelada, and it didn't taste right. Food was good, but it took a little longer than it should have."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for over 15 years. Always a good vibe. Great craft beer selection. Having a brat with kraut and a saison tonight. Just had a craving. Happens to also be a Packers bar and game us in full effect. No worries tho, food and service still alll good, even with the crowd. There is also shuffleboard and a few video games. Cant go wrong. Always reminds me of my young ol days in the midwest."}
{"text":"I've only been to Big Dog's twice. It's just so damn far and there's no good route for me to get there. Otherwise, I'd make my way out there more often.

The first time I went was for their War Dog tapping party. I actually had another anti-teetotalism gathering at the Freakin' Frog that night. But I had always wanted to try Big Dog's, so I did the mini-road trip from work (near McCarran) all the way up to the great northwest. I was hoping to get there in time for a free appetizer, but that didn't work out. I ended up just getting my free pint of War Dog and leaving. Let me just say that the War Dog IPA is delicious.

By the way, I then turned around and made another mini-road trip back down south to the Freakin' Frog to meet up with my friends. Ken M says I deserve a beer badge for making that beer venue combo in one night.

My second visit to Big Dog's was for their Winterfest. Great event. I went with the 30-token + tasting glass starter pack for $30. I really didn't drink that much beer. My 30 tokens got me the following:

* Half pour of Big Dog's Raspberry Brewbie SupPorter. Yeah this was more like a full pour. Very tasty and part of the proceeds went toward the Keep a Breast Foundation.
* Quarter pour of New Belgium's La Folie Sour Brown Ale. Despite it's supposed \"limited quantity,\" they gave me more like a half pour. Not complaining! This was extremely sour, kind of like Sour Warheads. It was worth trying, but not sure if I'd ever order it at a bar.
* Half pour of Big Dog's Doghouse Dunkelweizen. Didn't like this all that much.
* Half pour of Deschutes' Hop in the Dark Cascadian Pale Ale. Absolutely delicious! Probably my favorite beer of the afternoon.
* 2 bowls of Chicken and Shrimp Gumbo. Obviously delicious, since I went back for seconds.
* 1 bowl of Chile Verde. Good flavor and spice.
* 2 Oyster Shooters. Made with Black Lab Stout. Surprisingly delicious.

So I have yet to go to Big Dog's for a non-event. I definitely will return one day though. I still need to try their Wisconsin Fried Cheese Curds (and compare them to Aces & Ales).

Oh and I love that it's a Packers bar. I'm not a huge Packers fan, but it would be fun to catch a game there maybe next season."}
{"text":"My bf and I came here for the packers game and it was a lot of fun! The place gets super packed and the atmosphere is awesome!! They have a lot of Wisconsin plates, which were super good! You must try the cheese curds and the Wisconsin brats!  Did I mentioned they brew their own beer?? I really like supporting our local brewers, so please come and drink a beer! Their service was really good, even though the bar was very busy our waitress was checking on us on a regular basis! I'm giving them 3 stars mainly due to their nachos and poor tv image. I mean, come on! A great sport bar must have great nachos!!! Their ingredients were very cheap and not very tasty, they need to add more ingredients and maybe some chicken. Also, knowing that this is a green bay packers bar their tvs should have a better image, they do not seem to have HDTV and they had tons of problems with the sound!"}
{"text":"I have patronized Big Dog's Draft House on several occasions, and on this visit I thought it important to leave a comment.

I arrived at 7:00pm to meet a party that had been at Big Dog's Draft House since 4:30. Upon meeting our party, my husband and I were informed that the rest of the group had been waiting for their \"Green Beers\" for over 20 minutes. My husband went inside to order at the bar, while I sat at our table on the patio. While I waited, others in my party beckoned our server, Lisa, several times, each time being told \"you are my next table.\" During this time we watched Lisa serve the two tables nearest us repeatedly. Before Lisa finally arrived to take our orders, Sam, who appeared to be a busser, unwillingly took our orders. I ordered four drinks and a side of fries. One of the drinks and the fries I ordered arrived within 10 minutes (none of the other orders ever arrived). We continued to wait for the remainder of our order for the next 42 minutes. Finally, we decided that enough was enough and flagged down another server to get our check. After carefully looking over our tab, we noticed that we were charged for two items that did not belong to us. It took several additional minutes to reconcile the bill. 

Ultimately, after sitting idle for more than an hour we requested to speak to a manager. Patty arrived at our table and heard our complaints. After a long wait, we were able to close our tab. Patty returned to our table with three gift cards for $15 each. 

Big Dog's Draft House gets 1 star for their deliberately POOR service. And, 1 star for their attempt to appease us with gift cards."}
{"text":"Once again Big Dog's, you didn't disappoint!   Literally the minute we got off the plane and got our rental car, we immediately went to Big Dog's.  And yes, I got my pot roast sandwich!   We had a group of 6 people and everyone loved their food.  My cousin had a huge burger with a bratwurst on it, on a pretzel bun.  She devoured it and said it was the best burger she'd ever had.  We also had the fried cheese curds which were gone in seconds LOL.  

I couldn't finish my pot roast sandwich and wanted to take it home, but someone accidentally threw it out.  They gave me a whole new sandwich!  

Big Dog's, you guys rock.  Keep up the awesome work!"}
{"text":"Beyond horrible, I thought I ordered a bratwurst in a pretzel bun and I got a hamburger (tasted like a frozen patty from Costco), a sausage that tasted more like a bad hot link, and the bun did not taste like pretzel. It came with garlic fries which also were not good. How do you mess up garlic fries? I maybe should have tried the cheese curds instead? But at this point, I think it would be a waste of time."}
{"text":"Love this place. They have Monday football specials and Tuesdays they have a special on their ribs that are delicious. I always smell like cigarette smoke when I leave this place but the staff makes up for it with great customer service."}
{"text":"Craft beer at it's finest!  Sample the large  selection of on-premise brewed  beer while watching a game on one of the several TVs that surround the bar.  Compliment the beer with one of their signature sandwiches.  I didn't bring my reading glasses and differed to the waiter to surprise me with a sandwich.  He returned from the kitchen with a multilayer ed meat lovers delight sandwich held together with a knife being used as a toothpick.  Sorry, i forgot the name of the sandwich.  (Maybe due to one too many fine craft made beers.)  Give the place a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Typical old style bar with good beer and so so food. Service is not very good. Quite a few bartenders that need help with customer service. Maybe they are bitter since most are past their prime. Lazy cocktail servers that don't like to work knowing they work for tips. Bring friends, have fun, and ignore the attitudes from employees"}
{"text":"Favorite brew pub. Great brews, tasty food, and always superb service. They upped their tap game and have their own brews plus some really good other local beers plus some greats from Cali and rest of craft world. Happy hour is a great deal and I enjoy their different promotions (Mon - sliders, Thu - Moo & Brew, Sat - Old Fashioned Dinner, etc.). Saturday I had their September Saturday night promotion Tri tip steak dinner. Excellent trip tip & tasty sauce, mashed potatoes, corn for $13. Tasty bargain. Their quarterly beer festivals are a great way to try some tasty beers.

Only two things wrong with Big Dogs. First, Packers bar. Second, smoking like rest of LV but they do have a no smoking restaurant section plus a great relatively new expanded patio."}
{"text":"let me start by saying my family and i have always enjoyed the draft house. the food has always been good, the family loves becky to serve us. The problem is the last few time we go as a family (ages 9 ,11, 15 41 45 47 69) the dining room has been closed. we walked out the last three times but  decided to eat today becaus it was only three of us. the bartender and others were attentive concidering the are doing double duty. What gives?  trying to save a few buck? the bar area is not family apropriate. if this is going to be permenant we will consider not coming here. we were told the dining room oopens at 11 now. breakfast in the smoke filled bar with kids and elderly not gonna happen. diners beware."}
{"text":"We arrived at 8:20 for the all you can eat shrimp. When we approached the hostess, she informed us that she would seat us, but they are closing the dining room and we'd be the last customers. I'm unsure why this was relevant, it only made me feel like an inconvenience and that she was doing us a favor. My son got the shrimp those were good. These rest of our meals were awful. I got the roast beef sandwich and it was so greasy I couldn't pick it up, the bun fell apart on the bottom. The Mac and cheese was not much above kraft. The pasta was way over cooked. I was going to give 2 stars until we sat and waited 20 minutes after we were done eating for someone to address we needed the check. After we received our food we did not see anyone until that point, once the 3 of us had to stare down the staff to get attention."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great place to come and hangout. There are great deal during football season! And to top it all off there's great food, drinks and great service!"}
{"text":"Just finished our first time here. Not impressed. The food was blah and overpriced. Service was slow. Drinks were very weak"}
{"text":"Attended the Brew School offered in January. The class was great and the brewers were definitely knowledgeable about beer and how to make it. The grad party that was part of the package was a bit of a let down. The flyer said we were getting appetizers paired with our beer. Well, we got one app. Yes it is semantics, but I figured we were getting at least 3 apps since you said appetizers (plural). The growler was part of the package as well. When we got our certificates, one of them was for a refill. Well, it's semantics again, but when it says \"refill\", that says to me that the growler had been filled at least once. We  were told that the certificate was really only for our first growler.

Overall, we had a good time. I just think it needs to be more clear what you are providing."}
{"text":"Worst food ever. The chicken sandwich was red in the middle and the bartender server tried to pretend it was ok and \"normal\" to be red not pink RED. Gross. Service is terrible and u would rather go to fatburger next door. Witch is awesome by the way!!!!!"}
{"text":"Fabulous brewery and food establishment, they craft some excellent beers and feature a number of guest taps as well.

With live music, gaming, and being a Packer's bar, they feature something for everyone.

You must try the beer cheese soup and the cheese curds, their Hop Dog IPA goes great with everything."}
{"text":"Ate here for dinner while visiting my best friend in LV and the food was wonderful! The bartender even made my boyfriend a drink that she had never heard of.  I am sure this will be another favorite on my list of places to eat while in LV."}
{"text":"Home cooking, great specials, good beer, and cheese curds! Does not disappoint but I'm also from wisconsin ;)"}
{"text":"Some very good Craft Beers, I really enjoyed the 44 Magnum Red Hydrant Blend. I also had the Fish & Chips, and the Stroganoff . Both were good."}
{"text":"We have come here many times over the years, and EVERY single time, without exaggeration the hostess lacks a single brain cell. We stood for 15 mins because the hostess said there would be a 15 min wait, when there were 4 open tables. Countless waiters passed by, wouldn't make eye contact, and then a young man name Draven came by & listened to us complain & finally sat us. He deserves a raise, because he miraculously can do his job AND the hostesses!"}
{"text":"We had to drive pretty far to find this place which was recommended to me by my Biology Professor..who is a huge fan of beer so I was in. I ordered the HolyCow Pale Ale. which was very good for such a darker beer than I'm used to (5.3% alc) My bf ordered a stout by accident and drank it anyway.. guy thing I think. Followed by a North Coast which he said was good but prob. wouldnt order again, gave him a headache.. The waitress was great though and came by and gave me a huge beer of Belgium white beer.. OMG that was the best beer I've ever had. served with an orange - so delish.. and free b/c she said it was poured on accident and she hated to pour it out. Shame I was so full from the most delicious Cobb Salad I've ever had and right now I've been in a cobb salad frenzy ordering it everwhere I go b/c its so chuck full of healthy fats and protein. It had the huggest chunks of blue cheese in the dressing - and salad and bacon, egg, avocado, tomatoes, grilled chicken, cheese, black olives.. My bf ordered a cheeseburger.. so freaking good he cut me a lil taste.. and the french fries were not shoe string and not steak fries but just in the middle, just right and seasoned to perfection, they were the \"didnt even need ketchup kind\" so good. The couple nxt to us had a philly and a wrap, neither of which appealed to either one of us so we were so happy with our decisions.. The salad was better than I picutred it..and I ordere the small and I was stuffed.. I cant imagine what the large looked like. Geez. I'd go bk here in a heartbeat even if I have to drive all the way from Henderson. 
Note: Mondays is 2 for 1 philly cheesestake sandwhiches, not my thing but it might be yours.
Tuesdays is 2 for 1 Cheeseburgers YUM!!!!
Wed. is 2 for 1 AYCE fried shrimp.
and i cant remember the rest to be honest but those stuck out to me. 
Too bad I\"m trying to diet...hanging out with all this good food and beer CANNOT be conducive to my diet but all the same if you're looking for both good food and a chilled out atmosphere.. this place is for you. OH and MOST important.. we were there to watch a game and they had volume.. SO many places in town will show the game and then blare music instead... WTH? whats the point? This place has it all."}
{"text":"So I finally tried the food sober and for bar food especially one that has their own brewery and fresh made Rootbeer this place has my vote .

This is a Green Packers / Wisconsin theme bar so Cheese is king and boy oh boy did the Beer cheese soup steal my heart and space in my tummy ... I also got the peppered rib eye sandwich on the recommendation of Chelsea (she's awesome sauce ). The sandwich is huge and the french fries are yummy .. The prior visit I got the Santa Fe grilled cheese which also rocks but its super spicy for those who aren't a fan go with one of the other grilled cheeses and you won't be disappointed.. 

Overall for a place to eat food and watch sports and drink this is a fun north town spot and the service the past two times has helped move the rating up but after enjoying the food for north time this place got my 5 stars"}
{"text":"Good food, nice size portions, clean place, decent service, good value. I split the CLUB SANDWICH AND ONION RINGS with a friend. The breakfasts are good here as well.,......... LOVE THOSE BRATS AND EGGS and ENGLISH MUFFIN AND POTATOES! The  REUBEN SANDWICH IS GREAT!!! They have great micro-brewed beer here. I really don't have a bad thing to say about this place except about 20 years ago they offered a STEW IN A BASKET meal.. stew inside of a hollowed out rye or pumperknickel roll that was soooo good..... don't know why they stopped offering it. This is a good place to take your family or a first date. service and food quality has been consistantly GOOD for past few years. I really enjoy coming here..... sometimes there is a waiting period but I'll wait 15 minutes for  the quality they yeild."}
{"text":"I loved this place until my visit tonight. The food is great. Cheese curds, beer cheese soup, pot roast, and sausages are awesome. However, the service is terrible. They LOST my debt card. I placed it in the card sleeve, the server took it, brought it back and didn't say anything. I went to sign, my card and the slip weren't there. So I began to panic! The card wasn't on the table, in my wallet, or on the floor around me. I waved the inattentive sever down and told her my card was missing. \"Well, it wasn't there when I went to process it.\" So the search begins. She retraces her steps and after five minutes gives up. I begin calling my bank. Then from across the room some busser picks it up and gives it to the guest sitting next to him. HE GAVE MY CARD AWAY!!! The couple that he gave it to, got up and asked if there was someone missing their card. I wasn't expecting a free meal after this ordeal but it wasn't even offered. They asked me if I had a different form of payment before the card was found. You've gotta be kidding me! This was handled so poorly.  I really enjoy the food but this incident will prevent me from ever coming back. Horrible."}
{"text":"This is the third time Ive been to this bar three weeks in a row. Each week on a Friday night. I sit at the bar because Im a bartender an I enjoy the atmosphere the entertainment and the industry in general. Unfortunately,  everytime I've come here ive gotten bad service. Ive tried 3 times thinking maybe this time would be the last time and the charmed one. But, \"NO\".     I I do not drink or gamble but I do tip well an I do enjoy good service and good food and good industry people.  Unfortunately,  I will \"NOT\" be back ever again. Thanks for the wings I did \"NOT\" want to go or to feel rushed to leave."}
{"text":"Super sad that I wasn't very impressed. I take a long time looking for a new place to try. I read all the reviews and look at all the pics. In Las Vegas, there are so many restaurants, it's kind of overwhelming. The pics for Big Dogs Draft house looked AMAZING! Sadly, that's where the amazement ended. My pictures look great as well. As far as the taste of the food? It left much to be desired. I will say the Pastrami burger that my son got was very, very good. But my chicken and artichoke Mac and cheese was not amazing. I am a foodie and I LOVE cheese. The flavor just wasnt there. I can't remember now what cheeses is said it had, gruyere was one, but it sounded great! Didn't taste that way. I think I found 2 chunks of artichoke in the whole thing. Just so-so overall. Would not order again. My husband ordered a steak. It had AWESOME steak flavor... But I seriously think they forgot to season it!! I'm not kidding!! There was no salt on it, and I use salt very, very sparingly!!  It doesn't taste the same when you add salt after the fact... Again super disappointing for a $24 steak dinner. 
We ordered: 
Pastrami burger
Kids pizza meal with drink
Chicken Mac and cheese
Steak with 2 sides
3 beers
1 root beer ($6??)
1 Dr pepper
1 order of cheese curds
Our bill was $93. Had it been a great meal, it would have been worth this. But it wasn't. Sadly, we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday in April for lunch, the outside patio seemed like it would be a great place to have lunch on a nice Vegas afternoon.  Service was so bad that we left after 20+ minutes and never got the drinks we ordered."}
{"text":"I took my wife and a friend in for dinner and a beer.  The service was exceptional and the server was very friendly and genuinely cared if we were enjoying our meal.  The Wisconsin Cheese Curd appetizer was a great choice.  We all enjoyed our meals, the beers and the atmosphere in the dining area.  No smoke and limited noise level made conversation easy and relaxed.  We will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"After searching all around North Las Vegas for some food after a long night of drinking and listen to some local bands, we found the North town's Big Dog location. This was my first to the Draft House but I know it won't be the last.

-Food selection was great, and was very surprised by the quality and great selection of non fried foods. It was 3am and usually fried diner food is all one can find so this was a HUGE plus. 

-Got the breakfast sandwich with sausage, one friend got the same with the bacon, and the other got some kind of big salad. 

Everything was great and they had to-go boxes on hand to take home our drunken left overs. We are already planning on going back, and if not to this location to the other one.

Oh also our bartender was so cool and quick to get us everything we needed. Thanks for saving out night."}
{"text":"Being big craft brewery fans we had to stop here. They were out of a few of their own beers but the wheat and Pale Ale were really good. Now for the food. Beer cheese soup was so amazing I could have had a bucket of it. The beer pretzels were hot and delicious. The staff was very friendly. Bottom line GET YOUR ASS OFF THE STRIP AND GET HERE. Quickly."}
{"text":"The ghost pepper cheese adds just enough heat and the burgers are excellent. They have a nice outside seating area and plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Great local bar with diverse array of finger foods; great, reasonable happy hour. Is a full out packer bar during season."}
{"text":"I've been driving past this place with curiosity for well over a year before I finally decided to stop in.  And now that I did; I wish I would have gone sooner!  Everything I had here was great!  

I ordered the sweet and tangy wings, which were very good if you're a wing person.  I've been searching this city to no end for good wings, and these wings were definitely up to par.  I'll be going back soon to try them all.  

The sticky garlic wings were also good, but didn't pack much garlic flavor.  I'd recommend asking for extra sauce. Still a good, crispy wing though 

I built my own burger, and I was really satisfied with that too.  I went with ghost pepper cheese, jalapeños, grilled onions, and green chiles.  There was some kind of package deal that came with a beer too.  


I finished my daughter's chicken fingers after my meal.. again, very good!  Chicken fingers are hard to mess up, but when was the last time you had chicken fingers that were actually great?   Big Dog's chicken fingers are great.  

Needless to say, the beer menu is stacked; but I'll say it just in case.  

For beers and burgers/bar food, this place really hits the spot.  There's both indoor and outdoor seating, a friendly atmosphere, and the service was fast and friendly.  All around great place for bar food and drinks.  Especially if you hit happy hour between 3 and 6."}
{"text":"Service is usually slow, but the food is amazing. Highly recommend the bratzel! A big, juicy and messy burger with a big party, bratzel, bacon, fried onions served in a pretzel bun--also comes with your choice of side. We always order sweet potato fries on the side. It can be a bit on the pricey side at $14.50 (extra for sweet potatoes dries), but it's a very good indulgence every once in awhile!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went there the other night around 11:00pm. We had amazing service I wish I had got the women's name. She was great very attentive. Which is hard to find at that hour! My husband had steak and eggs. I had chicken fingers, we both had draft beers! Everything was amazing my husband steak was great. I wished I had got one to! Can't wait till our next date night there!"}
{"text":"We heard there was a Badgers/Packers bar up north and wanted to check it out for the Badgers - Sun Devils game.  Btw, it was a very unfair ending, so if you decide to comment on this review, please do not say anything about this game.  It's kind of a sore subject. LOL.

When you drive up you're greeted with a couple of unforgettable pieces.  First is the huge house shaped sign that welcomes you to the joint.  On the way in, there's also a very large dog statue with a sign that says, \"do not climb on dog.\" They shouldn't have put that there.  Later in the evening, our curiosity prompted us to ask the server to climb the dog.  When we got the 'good to go,' we literally took a thousand pictures on that statue.  Awesome.  The inside is pretty huge.  It actually reminds me of a local pub in Wisconsin.  Pictures, awards, Wisconsin shaped everything!  The bar is definitely the center piece of the establishment.  It takes up 50% of the joint.  TV's everywhere make it easy keep track of the game.  The staff was super nice.  Our server was on point.  She really made us feel at home.  I loved the ambiance.  Totally my kind of place!

The cool thing is the fact that they have a line of their own signature brewskis.  We got a total of 4 pitchers of the Leglifter Light.  This American style light lager alternative is mild in flavor and super refreshing.  With only 4% ABV (alcohol by volume), it is sure to keep you going throughout the game.  For our food, we started off with the Wisconsin Cheese Curds for $10.  It's white cheddar cheese curds, breaded and fried golden. Served with homemade dill horseradish sauce & ranch dressing for dipping.  Man, this was good!  If you like cheese, you will love this!  The breading was crunchy and flavorful.  Curds were perfectly salty.  We also got the full order of Doghouse Nachos for $14.00.  Chips with cheese, tomatoes, jalapeños, olives, sour cream, scallions, salsa & guacamole.  This bite reminded me of stadium nachos.  Nothing special, cheese from a can.  Lastly, we got the Chicken Wings for $9.00.  It's served with celery and carrots. You can choose to have the wings plain, BBQ, medium, hot, spicy chipotle or honey hot.  We asked for half BBQ and half medium.  The wing was crispy and perfectly fried.  The mild sauce was my favorite.  The actual sauce didn't seem to over power the wing and really showcased the chicken taste.  The BBQ, on the other hand, seemed to really over power the wing for me.  Super sweet flavor. If they used a little less sauce, I think I would have enjoyed it a bit more.  

After all brews and food, our bill was $80 for 4 people.  That's a deal.  It's definitely a far drive, however, it is Packers/Badgers season.  It's time to man up and return there for game time.  I'm so happy I found a Packers/Badgers bar that I actually enjoy!"}
{"text":"Now I found my favorite beer, BLACK LAB. Very smooth, enough alcohol to make myself happy, finish was just clean too. I came here with my girlfriend to have our typical late night food, Mac & Cheese w/ ghost pepper. Server was great, and the bartender who recognized us greeted me warmly. Amazing food, amazing beer. Maybe I will try something else besides Mac & Cheese for sure."}
{"text":"My bf myself and our uncle love going to this bar. They have really yummy bar food as well as a sit down restaurant. Good service but if you want to sit and eat in the restaurant make sure you call in at least a couple of hours in advance to reserve a table because they don't have many tables and it can get busy in there. Came with a party of 8 and waited like over an hour to be seated on a Saturday night. Yikes. Food and drinks were worth it but we were starving."}
{"text":"I have to take off a star and hope I don't have to take anymore. 

Part of the reason why it was comfortable to be here is the night time staff was friendly and attentive. We sat in our usual table and even though the bartender was stuck behind a bar he still walked over and asked periodically if we're still doing alright.

 The BF and I went in and there was a bunch of new staff. We walked up to the bar to order to go last week since we didn't feel like hanging out and having beers. The bartender and the bar back ignored us a good 5-10 or so minutes even though they were not busy. They were even having a conversation directly in front of us and ignoring that I'm looking right at them. I was just sitting there like WTF? and debating on leaving if another 5 more minutes elapse.

 There was a girl who seemed to have come up to the computer to check something (she was on her break) and she stopped midway walking away and asked if we needed something since I probably looked cranky sitting there. She put in our ticket and put the check in front of us. I put my card and the whole time the bartender never acknowledged us, never came by to take my card. He's even joking around and dancing to the music, but no time to payout my bill. 

Even when our food was ready, he just handed us the bag. My bill still wasn't paid because he didn't want to take it the 20 minutes I was there waiting for my order. Good thing I'm a honest person so I waved my card to be taken instead of cheesing it. Then he went to the computer and rang up 2 other people first, gave them all their papers before getting to me who was the only to-go order needing to get home before my food gets cold. 

Ugh, I surely hope this guy isn't the new regular night bartender because he doesn't know how to time manage nor the A,B,Cs of service. If the next time I come in and it's the same guy and none of the waitresses are working, I'm walking back out. Serious- I won't scratch my eyes out to get service at a place I raved about as a friendly, attentive neighborhood bar."}
{"text":"Big Dogs, host to endless outdoor beer gardens with over 40 brews on tap, live entertainment, good food, friendly servers and all the wisconsin theme you could ever want. The location works since its on my side of town. My favorite brew is thr \"Tailwagger\", a very nice hefeweizen. Try the pretzel. Yum!"}
{"text":"Long way from the Strip but worth the trip for a good beer. Wanted to try the Alpha Dog double red (rated A on Beer Advocate). I would say overall very satisfying. We mostly had sandwiches and salads, all were as advertised and tasty. Portions were good and prices not bad for Vegas. If you are in the area you won't be disappointed! 

Hope to try some pizza next time. Also good if you are after a Wisconsin-style Bratwurst (son-in-law had burger w/ a Brat on a pretzel bun!)"}
{"text":"Good place for a beer and a burger."}
{"text":"Come here with my dad sometimes to throw back a few and laugh at stupid people on television.

The beer is good, they brew their own and it is awesome. My favorite is the Red Hydrant. 
The food is also pretty good, from what I've had. Mostly just the bar food appetizers and salads, but they do have an extensive menu with sandwiches, burgers, and other entrees that I have yet to try.
The only thing that would be lacking is the service. I usually go here when there's only 3 or 4 other table occupied, yet it takes the waitress takes forever to come back with the check."}
{"text":"I love this place for the beers. I love me some good beer on tap. 

As always, I look for places that have good service. I've always recieved good service with any group I've been with, and I've noticed the staff is good with all of their customers. 

These are a few of my favorite things:
Mirror Pond beer
Wisconsin Cheese Curds
Big Dog's Salad
The Bratzel

That's more than a few things, but these are the things I eat the most when I go. 
There is also a jukebox there which is a must for my boyfriend...it sucks when other people only want to play country music. I'm from Oklahoma, and I can't handle one after another. The only other downside, a lot of people smoke. That is one of the only things I hate about Vegas. You should not be allowed to smoke indoors and make other people suffer, but that's another subject."}
{"text":"Wow! Went to Big Dogs last night and found out our favorite bartender David who has been serving us for years, was let go.  A few weeks ago David and Lee gave my friends and I great service and I've been meaning to review on Yelp what a great job they did for us.  We've been getting great service from David for many years and he is super nice, hard working, and super fast and attentive service.  My friends and I even would joke on occasion at another bar saying how our bartender at Big Dogs could out serve 2 or 3 other bartenders at other bars because they are always talking or watching the games and not paying attention to  the customers needs.  Hopefully David will turn up in a NW bar nearby and we can find a new favorite place to hand out!  Amazing the poor decision some businesses make and David WAS the reason we came back.  We LOVE and EXPECT great service and knew where we could find it.  Since I'm a marketing consultant, I see poor decisions by businesses everyday that costs them lots of money, so I'm never too surprised.  I'm sure when they see their loses in sales, they will have no clue as to why, lol.  I see it everyday."}
{"text":"I love Big Dog's. Great place to hang out with friends & enjoy some local craft beers. Great place to hit at 2am when you have the breakfast munchies. Great place for lunch with the wife. It covers all the bases.
Beers are delicious, my fav is the Red Hydrant(?): kinda like a Newcastle with hints of toffee, YUM!
Cheese Curds are deliciously greasy, garlic fries give you that wonderful hot-breath, and the Bratzel sandwich is amazing: Bratwurst on a Pretzel Bun, how can you go wrong?!?
They also have lots of TV's, big-screen Golden Tee, and a nice internet jukebox."}
{"text":"Fine place to get a meal or a craft beer and watch a sporting event. The stroganoff was excellent as was the burger. A wide variety of options so I'm sure you will be able to find something good to eat. If you're going on a fate or with old friends to catch up, the noise level is high as you would expect in a sports bar atmosphere so you might consider the dining room for your meal and then move over to the bar area to for \"dessert\"."}
{"text":"this is a great bar our go to spot on football season our team PACKERS of course .. and Chelsey is our waitress every time we come ( we try to sit on her section) she's attentive and makes you feel very welcome.. she's Amazing..we have made this our bar food /drinks are great prices.. highly recommend this bar!!"}
{"text":"Dimly lit bar with plenty of video poker spots. The beer they brew in house has great flavor. The service was ok, although there was only one bartender for a large bar. Definitely get the Poutine or the cheese curds. They know what they're doing with cheese for sure!"}
{"text":"We come here at least once a week. Great service even when it's packed the pot roast is delicious everything I have eaten here is awesome. Try the blue paddle Pilsner its my favorite"}
{"text":"I used to frequent the east side Big Dog's but as I know live on the west side that just is not possible anymore. Anyways I am a huge fan of local eating. This is one of the few local breweries in the city. To make it even better they brew their own Root Beer. So for you non-alcoholic drinking people out there I will tell you that it is truly a treat!

The food is a little above bar food. I might go a far to say it is almost gastro pub level food, but really they focus on burgers and brats. So it really isn't gastro pub level.

There are usually great specials either during football games and sometimes just during the week. Not that the prices are terrible normally but getti more food for y our dollar is certainly not a bad thing!"}
{"text":"Las Vegas Brewery Stop #1

24 hour brewery....I like it. The draft house is in North West Vegas, shaped as a big barn with cow statutes out front.  We ordered a sampler and were surprised by the quality. There is defiantly a stigma to beer brewed in Vegas. Normally craft beer isn't cheaper than anything Anheuser...basically get off the strip for a good beer at a fair price. We enjoyed there:

Leglifter Light
Tailwagger Wheat
Holy Cow! Original Pale Ale
Red Hydrant Ale
38 Special (blend of Holy Cow & Red Hydrant)
Black Lab Stout
Dirty Dog IPA
Seasonal: Pumpkin Ale

Pale, Red Hydrant, and IPA took it. Good quality. Nice service and a good vibe. Big Dog's is a packer hangout with memorabilia all over the walls. Good first stop."}
{"text":"A charming vibe, with a great selection of beers brewed in house. Beers were varied and delicious, and not lacking for a certain unique flavor. Food was hearty and filling, especially the cheese curds and the Bratzel Burger. Unfortunately, the service was particularly slow during my time there, due to a recent update of the menu, or so they said. Took us nearly an hour to get our food, and 15 minutes alone to get our drink order. All in all, tasty food, but maybe save a trip until they're back in the groove with their new menu."}
{"text":"My favorite spot to get burgers in Las Vegas the service is always amazing best cheeses in the city. Is a biweekly ritual in my household. The burgers and the fried cheese curds always have us coming back for more. Not to mention the tailwagger wheat beer which is absolutely amazing. I would recommend to everyone I know."}
{"text":"I'd have to say for bar food, this is one of the best places. Cheese curds are out of control delish! Twice baked wings......in my humble opinion the best I've had in town. I don't like oversized wings, and they cook theirs just right. Not slimy, and the perfect amount of crunch on the outside. I will say the seasoning can be a bit on the salty side. The service we have experienced has been good, never has been bad. So why three stars??? Well, it's bar food, good bar food....and pricey bar food. The twice baked wings are 11.99 and its maybe 8 wings. Then you have to pay extra for fries and a drink. The garlic fries are also really good. So your looking at close to 16.00 bucks for some wings. I love going but not too often just because of the prices."}
{"text":"What a surprise . . . originally from southeastern Wisconsin . . . stumbling into a Wisconsin bar located in Las Vegas.  The décor and memorabilia was just great . . . and being able to see the brew kettles made it even better.

Had there beer of the day . . . and while it was good and tasty . . . it could have been a bit colder.

Ordered the Bid Dog Nachos with Grilled Chicken . . . typical bar nachos . . . but the chicken tasted a bit like deli chicken . . . and not fresh grilled chicken.

I am probably giving it an extra star . . . being from Wisconsin . . . but with a little work on the beer temperature and updating ingredients, this place good be a GREAT sports bar."}
{"text":"Love taking my dog there to sit outside. Beer is good and food is good. Every server I've had seems pretty bummed out to be there though."}
{"text":"My parents have lived down the street from here since 1995. We used to go during the afternoon or early dinner, the menu is diverse and pretty much everything is good. I havent been here in over a decade until recently and I was very happy to see not much has changed. You can get breakfast at anytime, free drinks at the machines, amazing fried shit, in house brews (among others), friendly crowd and staff, lots of seating and pretty much a local spot. Beer wise I like the Leglifter or the Talliwagger personally."}
{"text":"Well, first time here... specifically ordered our appetizer fries to come with our sandwiches. Didn't happen, waitstaff asked if we wanted her to bring them out cause they were under the heat lamp waiting for the burgers to get done. Rather than eat mushy fries-we said yes expecting sandwiches would soon follow. They came almost 20 minutes later. Food itself was very tasty, pot roast sandwich was amazing!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for the past year and a half,  so I feel confident giving this establishment such a high review.  The food has consistently been delicious and never a complaint about service. Why not 5 stars? For me,  it's just that unless I eat food that is so mouth watering that I want to slap my mother,  I reserve 5 stars for a few establishments.  But don't be discouraged. If you want fresh, unpretentious home styled cooking with a great beer, this place is for you.  DON'T SKIP ON THE CHEESE CURDS!!"}
{"text":"As a fan of quality craft beer, I was excited to try Big Dog's. I'd had it bookmarked for months. Unfortunately, I came on the wrong day; they were out of the first FOUR beers I ordered -- the pale ale, Red Hydrant, Dirty Dog IPA, and 38 Special. Finally, I had the waitress tell me what she DID have, so she went off to the bar, and came back with a recommendation of a rye ale, which I ordered. It was probably the best fifth choice I've ever had. Apparently, Big Dog's had taken part in some sort of craft beer festival the day prior, and ran out of all of their beers there.

For food, I had the sliders, which were okay; nothing special about them, and no reason to order them again.

Our waitress (sorry, can't remember her name) seemed to want to do a good job, but also had a bit of a deer-in-the-headlights look about her. I envisioned that she had recently been in some sort of white-collar industry, and had not been waiting tables for very long.

I would probably give Big Dog's another try, but I'm not really in any hurry to do so."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a beer and possible food. Nice atmosphere. Low lighting which I appreciate at times. Beer list is extensive and plenty of styles to choose from both house craft and guest brews. Ordered the Southwest Steak Salad, so good I didn't even need the dressing. Honestly the salad was more flavorful than the dressing itself. I'm excited to go back and check out the other food/drinks they have. Service was great, very attentive at the bar."}
{"text":"Great venue! This is the staple of Las Vegas beer. The best Midwest food in town....brats and cheese curds! Try the IPAs especially War Dog. The fests are very fun to go to; however, they get cramped in the later hours."}
{"text":"Im a big micro-beer fan and was excited to try another Brewery while in Vegas. The beer was very average, and the service was also equally average.

Front of house had a major dive-bar feel to it and the brewery portion (separated by a glass window) appeared active but very cluttered and tight on space (despite the brew-side being in a large facility).

The place was very loud inside (there was a big game on, so rightfully so).

Only thing that really gave me pause was that the waitress had no idea what a \"flight\" was when taking our drink orders, kind of scared me for a minute seeing that this was a brewery. She was otherwise kind and helpful. I did have to chase her down to pay my bill though, but she seemed to be the only waitress"}
{"text":"Not a big fan of sports bars but Big Dogs is a must.
The food is delicious and everything I ordered came out exactly as I asked for it.
The service is amazing.  The wait staff is friendly and accommodating.
And most importantly, they take reservations.
Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"My Mom and Dad from out of town wanted to try this place and I'm so glad we did!  The service was great and the food was amazing! Nothing fancy but definitely a good spot for a delicious lunch!"}
{"text":"Cheese curds are weak imitation of true fried goodness 
The burgers are okay, not good, not great, but meat between bread. 
The sweat potato fries are dry and not worth ordering
The \"unfiltered\" Hefewizen was as Coors lite at best
The service was good, but not good enough to excuse the food and extra average beer."}
{"text":"It seems there is a new menu, a new patio but the same great service. 

We hadn't been in for a while, we enjoyed the nacho's before but for two people, it's a big plate. They would allow half orders but no more, so if you are hungry or have a large group, the nacho's are a good app.

They also had in the past a bratwurst plate, thats been gone for sometime, but they also had a steak and sausage sandwich, but now it's chicken and sausage. 

They have added pizza's, not too bad, the flavor is good but the crust is not my favorite. 

Overall, good food, good beer and good service!"}
{"text":"Burger was good, fries were cold. It took thirty minutes to get a glass of wine to the table and we waited 40 minutes to get our food."}
{"text":"This much oil in the basket only mean that the all you can eat is just a gimmick or the chef is lazzzy.  Just the 4 order refill and no cocktail sauce and the basket full of oil.....  
time to go I guess, before the chef give me a heart attack."}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed with Big Dog. Had their beer sampler and they all seemed rather cautious to me, not bad, but nothing raised an eyebrow."}
{"text":"I love the pizza here and I like the vibe for the most part. Normally when I come, I just go to the diner portion. 

Last time I was here about a week ago, we came to order some to go food, sat down and played some slots while we waited. I have to say, I'm not a fan of the women bartenders. If you aren't a regular the service isn't so great. You have to wait even when you've asked for something before a person they know by name. Big dogs on Torrey pines should have never been shut down! 

I will continue to go here for the pizza. Their fries suck, unless you get the garlic ones (which will have you smelling like funk for a week) also the chicken fingers were great."}
{"text":"I took my wife and kids to this place for Mother's Day  and sat outside. The waiter with his man bun was apparently in charge of the area. We sat for 20 minutes and no nothing. The dude came out and asked other tables what they wanted and ignored us. I have been to this place 4 times and had to walk out. Well after the waiter saw we were sitting there and looked me in the eye,  no nothing. Took the family and left. I think this place is against people with American Flags on their sleeves.  Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Heard lots about this place but my expectations are not a kick in the pants.
The beef stroganoff had three pierces of beef and the Chicken Tortilla soup was wayyyy to spicy. Other than that comment my grilled Pastrami was exellent.  The root beer is the best ive had. Will likely be back but hold the beef stroganoff and tortilla soup. I would bet the burgers here are a must have."}
{"text":"Used to love the one on Torrey Pines and Saraha.  They closed so I came to this one!  SO LET DOWN...way to smokey!   I was obsessed with the graveyard food and service and was so disappointed I won't go back...if friends wanna meet there I usually just stay in rather than go out!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Great food & beer, lots of machines to play.and a large amount of TVs for your viewing pleasure"}
{"text":"We brought out of town beer lovers to Big Dog because it has a great local reputation and we had not been here before. We are former Midwesterners. We loved the Wisconsin theme and menu. We ordered appetizers and beer. We loved the cheese curds and that you can add french fries to your order for an extra dollar. It was fun selecting beer from the varied choices on draft. We also loved that the restaurant was smoke free and separated from the gaming bar area. We will go back and try the walleye next."}
{"text":"Service wasn't the best, don't expect hand to foot service but the server wasn't doing her job properly, this older couple walked in and it was at least 5 mins not one person came to seat them , one server walked past but didn't realize they seated there self , had to get the server attention to tell her they seated they self , it sucks that I have to write this but if u want people to have a get experience then do a little better"}
{"text":"Best local bar in town. Great beer, great good, and great service. This place is definetly my favorite local hang out.  I go every chance I get."}
{"text":"Tends to be a meeting spot whenever I'm in the northwest. Solid bar food, plus the only place I know of that has walleye. Their brews are pretty good, but if it's war dog season, order no less than three. Then a growler of it to go, it's liquid gold. Fun times at their mini brew festivals as well, held every few months."}
{"text":"I went here last night and thought it was pretty good! They have my fave angry orchard on tap which is always a plus and their chicken tenders and fries are really good! I love a place that has good tenders! They also do nightly specials which is good. The decor and such is really eclectic and if you're in the area it's great to check out! They have an all ages dining area which is always a plus if you have a family."}
{"text":"This is the common cure  for your average las vegas Bar. (Yes is stole that from Mad Men).  Let's start with the fact that they have a micro brewery there!!!  It is kinda of the closest thing we have a for a real locals tradition sorta thing.  

What I love about this place is the Breakfast!  They have a different menu with some one of a kind items - atleast stuff you wont see on every other menu in Vegas.

I had the \"Bucky Breakfast!\"  Bratwurst, eggs, homefries, toast... and a spicy bloody mary.  The sausage was very tasty - what a way to start off the day.  I ordered \"basted\" eggs.  Most of the time restaurants don't baste them right, but I always order basted anyway.  This place basted my eggs as good as my mom does!!!!!  

I would give it 5 stars but too much Packer memoribilia!!!  JK."}
{"text":"A Bears fan going to a Packers bar doesn't make a lot of sense.  However, I do like the Red Hydrant Ale, the beer cheese soup and the last brewfest I attended despite the weather moving me inside. All good."}
{"text":"I wish Yelp let you score halves, then I could give this a more appropriate 2 1/2 rating. I tried five different beers, and the only one that stood out was the Fancy Herb and Lemon Saison. Everything else was rather bland, earning an average of 3.5 out of 5 on BeerAdvocate and Untappd. 

The pizza was disappointing, too. I had high hopes since they advertised all fresh ingredients, but I wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"First trip to the Big Dogs Draft House but had the opportunity to attend Winterfest. Fun festival to attend and it benefitted a cause dear to my heart (Komen of Nevada). The event was organized and they had some of the tastiest beer samples I have had in a while. It was a beautiful warm day to host the event outside with musical entertainment going on. Some folks brought their dogs so as time wore on, it got a little crowded. 

There were a ton of beers to sample but my favorite was a Belgian ale at 9% alcohol so the samples were only a half glass. I had a couple and quite tasty. Hoping I can locate locally and purchase. There were a few food offerings, a chile verde and a bouillabaisse. My hubby and I enjoyed the chile verde. There was also the option of heading inside the Big Dog restaurant and enjoying some food. 

I definitely will plan to attend the next festival is they did a great job on this one!"}
{"text":"I REALLY wish that Big Dog's was closer to me - I would go more often!

Unfortunately, I live in Henderson and that is just not feasible. However, I was there recently for the Peace, Love and Hoppiness Festival that they put on yearly. Too bad the weather didn't cooperate, because this could have been a really great event. That being said, the staff did a great job of accommodating everyone who ran inside during this massive rain storm! It probably worked out better for the bar, since everyone went inside to eat and order from the bar.

The beer selection was pretty darn good! Quite a lot of people left once the storm took over, so once the rain and wind died down, there was more beer for the rest of us!

I liked that it was basically a free event if you weren't drinking. You could buy a mug and tokens as you went, or you could buy a large amount of tokens. It was well organized and I may just make it back next year!

I've previously been to Big Dog's to eat - the cheese curds were calling me! They are delicious, as is the other food I've tried. The service is generally pretty good and there is plenty of parking. As I said at the beginning - I just wish it were closer to me! Maybe Big Dog's should open a 2nd location!!

Oh - and the patio out front is dog friendly, which we need more of in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Big Dogs is a great local brewery, and also is Las Vegas's Packer/Wisconsin Badger Bar!  Having gone to UW and spent some time in Madison, I can honestly say that this bar is my \"happy place\"!  It brings me back to a lot of font memories of the mid-west!  The food and beer are  great, and the people are friendly!"}
{"text":"I've never been to Wisconsin, but this is what I'd imagine a Wisconsin bar/grill would be.  The Packers vibe is high and there's lot of cheese and beer.   It's a great option for locals or for those of us tourists who want to venture off the strip."}
{"text":"This place has great beer so I go there for that foremost.  The food is plentiful, diverse and typical and pretty good.  I like that you can get Walleye Pike from Wisconsin here but the breading leaves a little to be desired.  They should offer it broiled or grilled.  Be prepared for smoke and beer in the air.  However, the servers are friendly, attentive and on the ball.  Good for sports watching too and place always has that festive feel to it. Pretzels are like in Germany.  Don't expect gluten free."}
{"text":"This restaurant is always packed with people and I have frequent this establishment serveral time over the years. It ihas great casual dining with large portions of home style food.  I was introduced to something new on the menu I have never noticed before, the Wisconsin Walleye 10-12 oz filet of this fresh water delicacy. It is offered in 3 ways: traditional corn meal breaded pan fried, broiled with citrus glaze or our house specialty \"pecan crusted.\" includes your choice of two sides for $20. The fish was delicious BUT, stay away from the breading, it over powers the delicacy of the fish. Unfortunately, I had to send it back because I ordered it with the \"pecan crusted\" coating.  Order it BROILED! The Broccolini side dish was tasted wonderful and cooked al dente to perfection. I am coming back for that same dish broiled."}
{"text":"I like their home brew tail wagger wheat!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to see a local brewery nearby when I first moved out here Big Dog's.  If it was just for the beer they'd get 5 stars.  Dirty Dog IPA and Red Hydrant Ale are my favorites.
  The food is simply bar food.  Nothing's ever come out wrong but nothing special.  They have been out of items before which is understandable but never what you wanna hear.  
  Love their lil outdoor patio.  The bar area though has such a gaming atmosphere.  It is kind of a turn off for people who want to enjoy good beer in a chill atmosphere without feeling baked out in cig smoke.  But it is sports bar-ish so it works for them.

Good beer but I'd rather buy a growler and take it home than chill there for dinner and a few brews."}
{"text":"Food and service excellent... I had the sirloin with blue cheese crumbles it was so good my fiancé had the ribs meat came right off the bone. The kids Pizza really good size for kids it was so cheesy.. Happy we tried it out"}
{"text":"The food here was just OK.  We split the cheese curd appetizer - it was okay, but since I'm from Wisconsin, I've had much better. For my meal I had the italian beef and sausage sandwich. It was decent, but not great. The beer here was good - they have their own brews and a pretty good selection. I really came here to watch the Packer game since this is a Packer bar, so that was a lot  of fun. EVERYONE  was wearing packers gear and it made me feel right at home! So if you're a packer fan, this is the place to be on Sundays! And if you want a seat at the bar on game day, make sure you get there early because the bar fills up fast."}
{"text":"Another update.   We were back in Vegas for Dogtoberfest and I was out there again in November.   Dave continues to brew some of the best beer around, the food was always top notch and the servers took very good care of us.   
However, I am very disappointed they let Dave go.   I knew him as Boston Dave and we first met him when he was at the Holy Cow.   They guy was a great bartender and blast to talk to.   Even though we don't live in Vegas, he clued us in to some of the really cool places to visit.   It's a shame to not have him at the Draft House any more.   The place won't be as good with him gone.   Please, whatever you do, keep Dave Otto and Sergio happy, the beer and the food makes this place special."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch after a trip to a new place that turned out horrible. We've been here before but my husband hadn't been in years. He is tough to impress. He loved it. He had the pot roast sandwich, I had the club. Everything was delicious and the service was good. I've never had a bad time going here. We'd go a lot more if we lived a little bit closer."}
{"text":"Pretty good service! Smoke is a little out of control, but on the upside their pizza is bomb"}
{"text":"How often have Diane and I eaten at Big Dog's?  In the past two years, just about every Monday night when we are in Las Vegas--which is most weeks of the year--and sometimes on other nights as well.  We were big fans of its long gone sibling situated on the Strip across from the Sahara Hotel & Casino where SLS now stands: Holy Cow, and its fresh Walleye Pike flown in from Wisconsin.  So it was an easy jump for us to enjoy more of the same here--along with plump Pan-fried Pot Stickers so good that they do not taste in the least frozen.  And every time I have tried something new I have not been disappointed.  So my other staples are now the best Beef Stroganoff in town, a tangy Pulled Pork Sandwich, and a memorable Holy Cow! Reuben.

But until last night I had never before sampled a hamburger here, even though I have heard great praise for them.  To take it up a notch, for my first burger I opted for The Bratzel, a 1/3 pound hamburger patty conjoined under a Pretzel Bun with a juicy butterflied Klement's Smoked Bratwurst, along with strips of Applewood Smoked Bacon, slices of tomato, Cheddar and Swiss Cheese, fried sweet onions, and some lettuce.  After adding some mild yellow mustard and ketchup to my medium-rare burger, and I was in for a real treat--even though I could barely get my mouth around the whole concoction.  The brat inside was juicy, just like the great Kosher Dill Pickle slice that was impaled by a steak knife on top of it.  As always, French Fries, too, were first rate.  And the flavor of the Pretzel Bread fortunately did not overpower the taste of the meats contained within.  This is a heavy meat eater's nirvana, and I'm glad I finally became intimately acquainted with it.

Once again service by our server Maria M. was friendly, efficient, and exemplary; and every ordered dish brought out from the kitchen made precisely to order, and of the same consistent high quality as experienced on previous visits.  This is truly a beacon of fine comfort food in the Las Vegas valley.  May it continue to thrive and please local diners, Green Bay Packer backers, and tourists alike."}
{"text":"Super nice servers bartenders good pay on keno $1.00 25c x4  four out four spot pay 
400 credits =$100 
No to many bar keno pay that way 
Great brews we be back"}
{"text":"Started coming here for beer fests a few years ago but come back for the food and community events. They have good bar food and a nice variety of tap beers including their own which is always a good thing. Service for events can be slow but regular days good and friendly."}
{"text":"another great meal here patty melt done right and burgers are good.  . beer special tonight is cream ale. Emily and Patricia taking great care of us."}
{"text":"Great food and an awesome IPA!  I love their grilled pastrami, but I guess it's on it's way out to be replaced by a Ruben.  They have a bar area and a dinning area.  If I wasn't a Vikings fan, this place would have 5 stars."}
{"text":"Big Dog's was the host for a Vegas Strong fundraiser for the shooting victims on October 19. 
All proceeds from $5 pints were donated. The event was very busy and they had a tent outside where 4 of the beers were available. Lots of Nevada breweries donated to the event, which was incredible! I was happy to support the cause and the amazing variety of brews (25 total) was not to be missed! 

Big Dogs is a nice enough place, and a huge place, with a lot of hustle on the part of the employees. The bar is very big and probably always pretty smoky, as it is a gaming bar. Fun tidbit- Big Dogs has 35 machines, which according to their Web site are \"grandfathered in\". I assume that having 35 machines is no longer permitted in taverns. The decor is welcoming and eclectic. The skee ball machine near the patio entrance caught my eye, and I would definitely try it out if I return. 

I placed a to go order at the bar and wasn't given a wait time. Instead of waiting at the bar, I went outside to wait near the patio. A server tracked me down with my order quicker than I anticipated it would be ready, considering the crowd inside. I had the green muenster grilled cheese with bacon, green chiles and avocado. Way too many chiles! It was basically a chile sandwich with not enough cheese. It tasted fine, but I was disappointed that their grilled cheese sandwich was lacking cheese. And the bread was a little burned. Doh!"}
{"text":"Great food and beer. Really enjoy Grandma's Potroast and their amber beer."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went there today around 2:30 pm and sat at the bar.  It took a while for the female bartender to even come over and get our drink order. She never came back to get our food order so we had to ask one of the servers to take our food order.  When the food finally came out which seemed like forever the fries were cold and the food was just OK.  We definitely do not plan on going back anytime soon.  Bad service and just OK food."}
{"text":"This is my least favorite dining experience in my three years in Vegas. Service was sooooooo slooow. Didn't get waters with our beers. Asked for to-go boxes then had to ask for check after that. Food was mediocre. I got the smoked mac and cheese. Flavor was ok but tasted like velveeta cheese sauce and noodles were over cooked. Fried cheese curds were good! You can smoke in part of the restaurant but the smell carries to the non-smoking section. There was a art print on the wall at our table and it looks like there were several food fights ages ago. Needs to be wiped off like the table. Had a house stout that was the highlight."}
{"text":"Even though we're not Packers fans, we love Big Dogs. The live music is great. Cheese curds are fantastic. Their fish dinners are always good. Service is a little slow, but not too bad."}
{"text":"Food is great, service sucks. My family and I have gone several times and waited (even though it was dead) for someone to come and wait on us. The last time I got up and walked out. Don't think we will be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"So I tried the red hydrant ale and it was really good. For lunch I ha the grilled chicken sandwich with lettuce and bacon. The sandwich was very good and the sweet potato fries for the side was even better!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere: dive bar with midwest style. Beer selections a great, plenty of good brews to choose from. Food is excellent, brats, ruebens, walleye fish, pizza and great salads. If u don't like smoke this is not your place, you smell like a firefighter after leaving. But lots of fun...Packers bar, so i won't be wearing my Seahawks hat there."}
