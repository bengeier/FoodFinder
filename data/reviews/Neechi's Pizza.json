{"text":"Great pizza, friendly staff. First time trying neechis pizza. As a active duty military member pizza is almost part of my everyday diet. I was very impressed with the taste and the amount of toppings the crust had good texture and was very tasty as well but the sause is what made me put them at the top of my list very unique  I haven't come across before in other pizza shops that I've been at across the country  (San Diego, Texas, north chicago,michigan,ohio) I travel alot so I like to get a taste of everyones pizza. And they offered me me a military discount which helps us military guys out thank you neechies."}
{"text":"My husband just walked in here to order dinner and the worker told him they were closed due to mechanical issues with their ovens.  A restaurant should lock their doors if they are closed. Very impressed with the customer service with this place."}
{"text":"We ordered the Hawaiian Pizza with wings and the deep fried cookie dough bites. The delivery was right around the time frame they gave me. The food was amazing! It tasted fresh, and the crust was spot on! The wings, spicy/sweet and Buffalo were very good and the sauce was amazing. I am pretty sure I became a diabetic after the cookie dough bites, they were gooey and crispy at the same time and we couldn't stop eating them! On top of that everyone I talked to from the person that took my order to the driver were very nice. After trying to find a pizza place around Avon I think our search has ended. You have our business!"}
{"text":"Best takeout pizza in NE Ohio. Very fresh and delicious sauce."}
{"text":"I have a new favorite pizza place. Their menu is varied including wings, strombolis and calzones in addition to the pizza. We got a sausage and pepperoni with sweet sauce (they have four different sauces). First off, the crust has a nice crunch. There's nothing worse than a doughy crust, but you won't find that here. The sausage is flavorful and the pepperoni is sandwich-size (also good). That sweet sauce though, wow, that is the highlight of the pie. I can't say enough how good that is! I can't wait to get back and try a few of their other items.   UPDATE  So I recently returned to Neechi's ordering a small sausage pizza with traditional sauce for myself. Their sweet sauce is awesome. Their traditional is disappointing. The big negative on my second go-round, however, was the immense amount of cheese they put on this pizza. That much cheese was kind of gross. That combined with the traditional sauce was not a good combination. On the bright side, the sausage they use is really quite good. Still, that was outweighed by the unfavorable experience."}
{"text":"I love supporting small, local businesses so I was truly disappointed when my wife and I tried out Neechi's in Avon, Ohio. Without a doubt, the pizza we purchased was the worst I've ever had. The sauce was bland, the veggies were cut so small and were so few in number that they added nothing to the taste, and the deli pepperoni covered the top of the pizza so thoroughly that we couldn't taste the cheese. In fact, I'd swear there was no cheese on the pizza. I hope our pizza's sad state was the exception rather than the rule and, if we try Neechi's again, we'll be happier with the product we're served."}
{"text":"Got the veggie pizza an wings. They really went above and beyond on the toppings. The wings were weary good as well. Service was very friendly."}
{"text":"We have ordered from here several times and each time it has been excellent. The deli pepperoni pizza is always a favorite along with the antipasta salad. Get the large size salad it's only a little bit more and almost twice the size."}
{"text":"We love the service, freshness, and taste of neechis. We love that they are a small local Business. But mostly, it's the most tasty."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT PIZZA!!! I have worked in a lot of restaurants and kitchens in my day, and the hallmark of great food is when they make their ingredients from scratch.  Neechi's makes their sauce AND crust daily, in the store.  They also source their ingredients from local suppliers and companies as well. The sauce, is tangy, bright, and flavorful, while the crust has the perfect consistency for the bed of toppings and sauce that covers it.  I love spicy foods,  including pizza, and Neechi's doesn't disappoint.  They have a spicy pepperoni, spicy sausage, and a bevy of spicy sauces that they can top your pizza (buffalo chicken) with. The pizza was phenomenal, the order was completed in a timely fashion, and this little gem of a family run pizza is cranking out some of the best pizza on the West side of Cleveland (located on SR 611/Colorado Avenue).  As far as taste and quality of ingredients, I'd rank this up there with Lorenzo's in Oberlin, and Angelo's in Lakewood, this pizza is that good.  In addition to pizza they have salads, sandwiches, chicken, appetizers that are equally tasty as well.  They cater any size event or gathering (call ahead) and deliver within reason as well.  Keep up the good work Neechi's, your family run business is really making some of the best pizza in Lorain County.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The pizza was bad news. The crust was bland and not proper crust. It reminded me of the worst possible frozen pizza but worse. All the flavors and textures were just bland and off."}
{"text":"Had a restaurant.com certificate for this place and was excited to try it out. Unfortunately,  will not be going back.  Had to wait 10 minutes after my promised time to get my pizza,  and honestly,  it was one of the worst pizzas my family has ever eaten.  We ended up throwing half of it away. I know they've won a ton of awards for their pizza,  so perhaps we just got a bad one!"}
{"text":"Good pizza. Huge calzones. Good apps. Usually takes 45 minutes to get. If it came sooner would get their 5th star."}
{"text":"loved the supreme pizza ! has all the toppings that should go on a supreme. definitely will order from them more now"}
{"text":"This place has really good pizza and wings. Haven't tried the other stuff but I am seriously obsessed with the pizza, sometimes we order it twice in one week. Lol the crust is airy and oh so good. You can't go wrong with this place. Favorite pizza in the area!"}
{"text":"Ordered a couple pizzas and some boneless wings the other night.  Pizza was okay, and boneless wings were good.  However, I think we slightly prefer Coleone's as of now."}
{"text":"Yelpers of the North Coast, lead me not a-stray. The need for a mid evening dough and cheese fix uncovered this mom n pop pizza stop. A 12\" 1/2 cheese - 1/2 pepperoni (along with IU vs NW) helped eased our basketball/pizza jones!  A light tangy italian tomato sauce covered by a salty stringy cheese blend over a crisp crunchy outer crust with some old school lunchmeat size pepps on top!  My BP and HR are on the rise...but hey you only live once... and its good to be back in my Rock n Roll home!"}
{"text":"When my husband and moved to the area, we were on the hunt for a new \"go-to\" pizza place. This pizza is our absolute favorite..everything is delicious. Highly recommend! :)"}
{"text":"Gluten free friends this is a great place for pizza. Feel confident because they had separate pans/utensils and safe practices. The pizza was delicious and they gave me a sample of the sweet sauce to try and I will be ordering next time. I loved that they didn't skimp on the toppings and definitely got my money's worth. Super friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"It's a relatively new pizza joint, so I think they're still getting their feet under them, but I have no complaints on the food. I'd like to see a little more uniqueness in their non-pizza options.  Friendly family atmosphere when walking in to pick up, and great pizza toppings including a variety of spicy and not spicy meats."}
{"text":"The pizza was good, the cheese, sauce and pep where solid. The crust had a great consistency but was very bland."}
{"text":"Not my style. Too much cheese and not enough sauce. We were not happy with the crust either. It was very dense and doughy. I had sausage, green pepper, and mushrooms. The toppings were very good.   Pizza is a strange thing to rate. Everyone's tastes are different. We were greeted with a smile and the food was hot and ready when we asked. Support our local businesses; give them a shot. Just not our style."}
{"text":"If you're a fan of spicy foods then this is your GO-TO pizza joint! Finally a pizza shop with an assortment of spicy toppings. Neechi's is new on the block but don't expect them to go anywhere anytime soon. This is a mom and pop shop so break away from  the chains and unleash the quality of fresh ingredients while supporting local businesses!   Neechi's has a very broad menu with many choices. Even a picky eater could build a dream pie with a toppings list this long.  I ordered my pizza with Spicy Pepperoni, Hot Sausage and Jalapeno's. These topping combined altogether are not recommended for the weaker tongues, but if you're a real man who loves the burn you will LOVE LOVE LOVE your pizza with these toppings!  I ordered the traditional sauce which is a bare bones basic sauce but it's not their only sauce choice and I heard their sweet sauce is even better. The toppings were delicious and didn't taste like your typical cheap chain pizza toppings.  You definitely taste the quality in the ingredients used. Beneath the toppings lies a crust that is tossed and cooked to perfection. The crust was flawless, thick and sturdy enough to hold your toppings while not being soggy and offering a nice crisp and crunchy edge. I loved the crust so much I had to ask more about it and I found out that they don't use sugar and only use olive oil. My first visit exceeded my expectations and I will definitely be back for more! If Neechi's has consistency, then they have a future of fortune! Keep it up Neechi's!!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza and they also offer gluten free pizza that is just as good.  The gluten free is a thin crust.   The non-gluten pizza is a thick crust."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite place!!!! Every week I get a pizza it has become sort of a tradition, in my home. Not only is the food amazing, the customer service is phenomenal. The owners are the sweetest people you can ever meet. If you are ever in Lorain County, ( City of Avon , to be exact) PLEASE, PLEASE stop in and pay them a visit, not just for their food but their hospitality as well. I promise you will not be disappointed.Thank you Neechi's you guys are the best. Happy Anniversary!!!"}
