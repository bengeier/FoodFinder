{"text":"This place is located off of Spadina next to a sketchy looking massage parlour. Hostess takes you up an elevator and you enter this welcoming and cool looking place. Although you could dress casual, most people came in a suit/sports jacket or dress. The service here is absolutely wonderful. They offer you free sparkling or still water. As others have said, you have a choice of 2 tasting menus. We each ordered something different so we could try everything. The flavours were absolutely wonderful. The plates are small but the flavours were intense and melt in your mouth great! I was full with the amount of food, but my husband was still hungry, so order the extra cheese plate. They give you the tasting menu as a keep-sake to take home. Make sure you make reservations well in advance. It took us one month to get in. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Alo knows that they are frickn awesome!! and they are!! I traveled from Edmonton, AB to Toronto and the first thing on my list of 'to do items' was to attend the best tasting menu in Toronto.  I did not attend because I was hungry, I wanted an adventure into taste and luxury. This restaurant did not disappoint my adventurous tour of cuisine. Julia Childs would not be disappointed and  I was delighted and entertained by each course I was served.  The service is world class, if I had a vote I would vote this restaurant for a Michelin Star award, The discipline is quite evident and mastery of each adventurous taste was amazing. I knew my sight that all ingredients were of superior quality including the Isigny Creme Fraiche from France.  This is the closest to France that I will ever get, I highly recommend a jump into European cuising by attending this place just for the ambiance."}
{"text":"A friend at work made a list of top restaurants in Toronto to check out and Alo was at the top of that list. I decided that I wanted to take my wife there for our anniversary, so I started planning by putting a reminder in my phone exactly 60 days before our anniversary. At midnight, 60 days before my anniversary, I was able to get a reservation for 8:30 PM through OpenTable. That's when the countdown began...  We started reading reviews, blog posts, articles and started getting even more excited, but a part of me thought that we might ruin the experience by setting our expectations extremely high!  The day before our dinner, the restaurant called me to confirm our dietary restrictions. I don't eat beef and my wife is vegetarian who also doesn't eat eggs. When we arrived for dinner, they confirmed our dietary restrictions, asked if we wanted to do the wine pairing (which my wife did) and then started us off with some appetizers. The food, from appetizers to dessert, was amazing! My favourite dish was the Quebec foie gras with sunchokes, hedgehog mushrooms, and chicken jus. The wine was supposedly really good too. We kept cleaning our plates to the point where our waiter said \"you guys don't leave any prisoners\" and he was right! The staff were easy to talk to, polite and very helpful. This dinner will hurt your wallet, but the experience is a must, especially for all people who love food that are from Toronto. BELIEVE THE HYPE.  We loved Alo and will definitely go back for another big milestone in our lives!"}
{"text":"I have been twice. The presentation and food quality are over the top and the service team is the best in the country. Its a pricey night out but the value is there! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My wife and I visited Alo for our anniversary and we were beyond happy with our experience.    The food was impressive in every respect - the presentation was polished and the flavours were bold where needed and subtle where appropriate.  I had the wine pairings (my wife is 7 months pregnant) and they each worked seamlessly with their associated dishes.    The only thing that might have come close to surpassing the food was the service.  Our main server was warm, friendly and paid us an appropriate amount of attention throughout the meal.  There were a number of other staff who interacted with us at various points through the evening and they were each very efficient at their various tasks and friendly when we chatted with them.  Special shoutout to Quentin (I hope I got his name right) who was very happy to chat about his time in Italy.  Alo is a gem in our midst here in Toronto.  I highly recommend visiting if you are fortunate enough to get a reservation.  We will be returning as soon as circumstances allow."}
{"text":"There is a review here by Keith C where he refers to a \"heavier set Indian guy who is always eating by himself\" every Saturday night - Not true, I'm only here about every three weeks or so :)  Absolutely superb - I've had dinner both in the dining room (once, and then again at a private wine tasting event), but all other times at the Chef's counter.  I rarely, if ever, rate a restaurant at 5 stars - however, Alo deserves it for every facet of their execution.  The service is superlative, the food is inventive, delicious and the ambience is perfect without being neither overly casual nor stuffy.  I always do the wine pairings and the wine service - right from the beginning with Anjana Viswanathan (who opened the place), then Toni and Christopher - is always interesting and well matched.  A superb match that has not changed much from the start is the Pain Au Lait (milk bread) with fleur de sel matched with Madeira.  That is a match made in heaven.  Patrick Kriss (Chef) and Amanda Bradley (GM) have created a gem of a place in the unlikeliest of places.  Kudos on a superb job."}
{"text":"Was super excited to get a last minute reservation for Alo having heard all the great reviews and must admit I was more impressed with the service then the actual food. The food was good but I wouldn't say the best in Toronto as far as tasting menus go, but the service and attention to detail was by far the best I've experienced thus far."}
{"text":"gotta write a review while ALO its still fresh in my mind. came here for my annivarsary and this place is everything you'd want in a top notch fine dining restaurant. the staff is extremely attentive yet non intrusive. they drop off your gorgeous plates in a timed fashion, they are a well oiled machine. the food itself is absolutely fantastic! and get this, i was FULL at the end of the meal. i was ready to go to mcdonalds afterwards to fill up but i totally didn't have to do that. they have 4 main courses and you have 2 options to choose from each category, but i'd just recommend sharing with your partner and just alternate the dishes so you can try a bit of everything! the dessert course is also broken down into 3. and there are little courses inbetween the big ones. honestly, i was blown away i was already ready to make reservations again since i knew that they'll be booked out for months. the course itself was $95 before any drinks, tax or tips. everything was worth the price. easily one of the best experiences i've had in toronto so far."}
{"text":"Amazing experience from start to finish.  Staff are as friendly as they come. Ambiance is warm and cozy with just the right amount of  sophistication.   We had the tasting menu with wine pairing and each course was outstanding. The presentation was elegant and the flavours were adventurous. Each course was an experience but be warned- this is not the place for you if you aren't open-minded, adventurous and don't appreciate a fabulous culinary experience. If you are someone who thinks The Keg is fine dining, bypass Alo and go to your nearest suburban chain restaurant for mozzarella sticks and fajitas.   Sure, the portions are small but this is not the type of food you eat in excess. It is not meant to be devoured quickly so you can make it to your 9pm movie. It is meant to be savoured and appreciated hence why the courses are spaced out. You won't leave stuffed but that is one thing I loved about it. I was able to enjoy the meal, enjoy the wine and not want to pass out by the end of it.   Definitely one of the best restaurants in this city. Well worth the cost (not even that pricey for the quality you are getting. $95 per person and an additional $65 for wine pairing) so if you have been debating whether or not to go, do yourself and your taste buds a favour and GET THERE IMMEDIATELY!!!   Thank you, Alo. You're fabulous."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant and fantastic good, we went here for a special occasion and they nailed it! By far the best restaurant experience I have had ! We will come back defitinely! Amazing."}
{"text":"Food was amazing, duh. But the service was impeccable.   Ambiance= It Takes a Thief+ Burnt"}
{"text":"One of the best meals we have ever had. I went with my boyfriend for his 25th birthday. Let me tell you, we were treated like royalty with such high-quality food. Truly made with love and passion.   I recommend this restaurant for those looking to celebrate a big milestone or birthday."}
{"text":"It's 4.35  It's overall very good(but it wasn't amazing that I can give it 4.5 or above.  It was very very close though).   All dishes were good but there wasn't a single dish that wowed us(Not a single dish that I would come back for alone).  Service was good.  We had the regular tasting menu ($95 each).  It's a 5 course meal but it's more like a 10 course meal because they provided a bunch of amuse bouche that's not listed on the menu.  Overall it was very good value for the amount of food that you get(at least for this type of restaurant).  They offered complimentary distilled or sparkling water which was a nice gesture for this type of restaurant.  We are not drinkers so we got 2 non-alcoholic drinks:  -Pear Tea and lemon ($8): Good mixture of pear tea and lemon taste.  Rating: 4/5 -Orange and Almond ($8):  Could taste the orange but lacked almond taste. Rating: 3/5   For the tasting menu we had:  -To begin(don't know exactly what this is called as they didn't put it on the menu), they provided 4 small pieces of cream cheese puffs and 2 pieces of bite sided foie gras puff pastry:  A very good way the start off.  Nice delicate taste.  Rating: 4/5  -English Peas:  Beautifully plated with a chicken skin on the side. Nice crispness on the chicken skin.  Rating: 4/5  -Hamachi, Zucchini, Preserved Lemon, Pinenuts:  This was one of the highlights of the night.  Nice big piece of hamachi.  All the ingredients go so well together.  Rating 4.5/5  -Pain au Lait: It's milk bread.  Butter was served in a cute little glassware.  It's better than average bread.  Rating: 3.5/5  -Dungeness crab, chanterelle mushrooms, garlic scapes, carolina gold rice:  Nice generous pieces of crab goes well with the other ingredients.  Rating: 4.25/5  -Morel Mushrooms, shallots, potato, isigny creme fraiche:  Very nicely plated.  This was okay for me.  Rating: 3.5/5  -Sea scallop, avocado, vadouvan, finger limes: This was the other highlight.  Scallop was seared to perfection(very tender).  Rating: 4.5/5  -Striped bass, baby artichokes, bluefoot chanterelles, hazelnuts:  The bass was bit too salty on this one.  The mixture of ingredients were okay.  Rating: 3.5/5  -Rack of pork, swiss chard, walnuts, bing cherries: Nice piece of pork and again very tender. Great mixture when eating with the cherry sauce.  Rating: 4/5   -Moulard duck, fennel, treviso, pistachio:  The duck was a little bit tough.  Very nice piece of pistachio.  Rating: 3.75/5  -Sheep's milk yogurt, tomatillo, rye berries: It's for cleansing our palette before going into dessert.  Nice little cool treat.  (I won't rate this.)    I think the dessert really fell short here.  Although it was nicely plated.  Taste wise it was not very memorable.    We had:  -Carrot, chamomile, lemon balm: This was okay.  Plating looked nice.  Didn't quite go well together. Rating: 3/5  -Rhubarb, almond, black pepper: This was a weird dessert.  As there were veggies on the side.  Rating: 3/5  -Dark chocolate, mint:  This was better.  Nice dark chocolate taste.  Rating: 4/5   I would like to try the tasting menu at the bar next time."}
{"text":"It was very cold in the restaurant so I had my jacket over my shoulder and the server offered me a shawl. That felt very heart warming. 5 stars for service. Food was 4 star - only if I were to compare it with other top-notch restaurants out of the country."}
{"text":"I had read about Alo for months before finally being able to try it myself. My expectations were therefore very high! Needless to say, my dining experience this evening exceeded my expectations far more than I could have thought possible.   Upon arrival, I was greeted enthusiastically by a hostess who sent me up to the gorgeously-decorated upstairs space in one of my favorite Toronto neighborhoods (Queen West). Then, an employee kindly took my coat, at which point I expected to get a coat check ticket and she explained to me that this would not be necessary. I thought this was a nice touch, since coat check tickets can easily be misplaced. The service for the entire evening was impeccable; our primary \"server\" was knowledgeable, friendly, poised and conversant. The restaurant's sommelier was kind enough to share with us many interesting facts about the wine that he chose for us (which, by the way, was fantastic). One of the best parts was that Patrick Kriss (the master chef himself) was kind enough to chat with us extensively and was very humble about his masterpiece. The fact that we got to know him even for a few minutes made the experience extra special. I would highly recommend sitting at the chef's counter. Being behind that counter was like watching one of one's favorite food network shows, but even more special because the performance was so refined. All of the chefs were calm and collected and did their work with true passion and true smiles. Even the washrooms were meticulously neat, such that at every step of the experience I felt like royalty. At the end of the evening, two employees were waiting for us with our coats ready in their arms, even before we had to ask them.  Now, onto the food! The 10 course meal that we had at the chef's counter was perfectly executed and incredibly creative. Every single course was bursting with exquisite flavor combinations that I didn't even realize were possible. I would hate to ruin the surprise of the tasting menu so I will not go in to details, but rest assured that if you love seafood as much as I do, you will not be disappointed. Also, if you are dessert lover like I am, the desserts are equally as outstanding as the rest of the meal.   This restaurant really sets a new bar for the rest of the establishments in Toronto. I am so grateful that Alo opened up in my home city and I feel very lucky that we finally have a restaurant worthy of the same praise as the ones I have been to in New York and Chicago, for instance. I will definitely be back at Alo as soon as I can!"}
{"text":"I hate to jump on the bandwagon, but Alo fully deserves a 5-star rating. I've been excited about this restaurant since its inception, and after two visits (with a third pending in November for the \"extended tasting menu\" at the Chef's table), I highly recommend that you visit ASAP. (You will probably still have difficulty booking several weeks in advance.)  While fine dining in Toronto seemed to go the way of the dinosaur over the past few years, Alo brings it back to the foreground with a vengeance. However, what scares many off from such experiences - namely, highly prices and pretension - Alo manages to avoid. While some may say that $89 per person is steep for the regular tasting menu, the overall experience (excellently executed dishes, top-notch service, and a gorgeous ambience) is actually a better deal than most restaurants of this calibre. Sure, the plates are on the \"delicate\" side, but add in the cheese, dessert and wine pairings, and even this hungry foodie left extremely satisfied.  While Toronto often has a tendency to get swept up into \"new restaurant hype\" (which is not always justified) - this time it is.  I'm counting down the days to November!"}
{"text":"Incredible dining experience. We had seats at the kitchen counter so not only did we get to eat the great food we also watched it being prepared. It took 3+ hours to get through the tasting menu of something like 18 courses!  The staff were incredible and the whole experience was a clockwork process in which we felt valued and well pampered.   Only regret is we missed seeing Gordon Ramsay by one evening. However we did get to speak to Head Chef Kris's and got a picture with him."}
{"text":"Simply an epicure's delight!  Worthy of being #1 restaurant in The country.  I was glad we did not have to wait 2 months for reservation.   We miss seeing you behind the counter Andrew P."}
{"text":"Alone, so sat at the bar. The tender is a champion at what he does. I have been to plenty of speakeasy's a la nashville and elsewhere, and he mixes the real deal. As suggested by another review, had the eats at the bar and these were fantabulous. Fried pickles, the potatoes in a to die for hollandaise type sauce that will no doubt clog my arteries, and the cheese plate. The food service at the bar is professional (the bartender does not deliver, but the wait staff), with full explanations of what you are going to eat. I may just need to head back there before I leave for the full meal. I have eaten in many fine establishments; this place is a class act for food and service."}
{"text":"Well it's hard to put into words how seamless and delicious our dinner was. Imagine a very well oiled machine working at the height of its power- that's the staff at Alo. Everyone was genuinely pleasant and nice, worked together and provided a service that is hard to explain- you just have to experience it.  The sommelier is incredibly knowledgeable and interesting, the wine pairings were perfect.   Our server Tomasz, was attentive, and I felt like he genuinely cared about our experience. Everyone in the restaurant is there for YOU. Wow, it's seriously hard to explain how well they work together.  The food was on another level. It's not that each dish tasted great, it's that the dishes in the tasting menu all made sense. It was a performance, not just a meal.  They were also very accommodating and understanding of dietary restrictions.  And they had my coat ready before saying goodbye. I've actually never experience such proactive and smooth service in a restaurant. Clearly they are doing something right, the staff is like family and the food is unmatched."}
{"text":"We sat at the chefs table and the dishes were very creative and tasty (which is not easy to find the combination of the two). The only thing is when we called for reservation, the person who answered the phone said the only table we could have would be chefs table. However, when we arrived at the restaurant, we were told \"chefs table\" is more expensive than regular salon, which surprised us a little as no one has mentioned it at all.   I also thought it was a bit expensive, nut the overall experience was great!"}
{"text":"Service is 6* superb.  You are being taken care of once you stepped in the restaurant.  Waiters and waitresses are so polite and professional.  Whenever you walk and pass by, they will step aside for you to walk first.  Every dish is fully explained.  When you are away from the table your napkin will be immediately being folded.  Every dish will have new cutlery set served.  The server ratio to customer is very high.  Once the washroom is used, it will be immediately cleaned.  All towels and toilet paper will be neatly rearranged.  When you are leaving, your overcoat is ready and to be put on by a server at the door.  A nice envelop with what you have consumed the whole night will be listed.  For the tasting menu refer to the photos"}
{"text":"Where can I select a 6th star....?  Very, very good. And nary a dollop of pretension.  No manufactured din. Good dish explanations, great plating.   A lovely wine pairing is offered. The sommelier proffered the bottle, poured and explained every choice; often somewhat obscure, and a little brave I thought on one or two pairings."}
{"text":"TBH it's a little over-rated but the food is good quality. I don't find the menu comes together as well as prix fixe served elsewhere. Our server was wonderful, he was clearly experienced, as was the sommelier, but some of the other younger staff came across as snooty and unapproachable. I felt the presentation of napkins and selection process a bit unnecessary, along with the magazine it was borderline pretentious."}
{"text":"With so many glowing reviews, and being the hardest table to get in the country I was super excited to go and expected to be blown away, but Alo blew it for me. Two boring fish appetizers, two meat courses that were bland and too chewy, a burrata cheese course I could have prepared myself, and one dessert I didn't want to finish (I'm a dessert fanatic). Michelin star quality? Not near the ones I've been to. Amazing service for sure, but the atmosphere in the restaurant isn't the best. High quality ingredients, and tasty dishes, but I could have gotten high quality and great taste for a fraction of the price somewhere else."}
{"text":"One of the best meals of my life. Went for my birthday and was blown away by the quality and creativity of the dishes and the servers were highly attentive. Left full but not uncomfortably so. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Reservations need to be made two months in advance and prepare to take a very late sitting at 10 pm!! Also, the air conditioning is way too cold and need to dial it down. They were attentive enough to give me a scarf that another guest probably left behind. The food and service was incredible and would come back in a heart beat. I even have set up an Alo fund where I save up every month just to splurge here"}
{"text":"For the bar only:  I walked in to get a seat at the bar and was promptly seated. Great, attentive bartender (wish I caught his name) that walked me through a few drinks, and I settled on the Armagnac Old Fashioned, which was great. Didn't feel rushed and never felt like I needed to wait to get his attention.  I also had the hamachi tartare dish (the bar does not have full service/full menu) with rice chips. A small snack rather than a meal, but flavorful. A playful touch with texture went a long way as the tender tartare surprisingly went well with the crunchy rice chips. There's a small table area in the bar area as well.  Definitely pricey, but I will happily pay the premium to enjoy the vibe here again."}
{"text":"A complete dining experience, not just eating at a restaurant.  I can honestly say that the service is completely impeccable. Every single moment is completely on point. After nearly every sip of water, a server was there within 10 seconds to fill my glass. As a big water drinker at meals, I loved the attention to service.   The food is also beautiful and precise. Clearly plated with tweezers, the presentation is lovely. Some flavours are new and exciting, while others are familiar and comforting. All around, food was delicious. As someone who has food allergies, I always feel slighted. On my visit, I didn't feel like I missed it at all because everything was so good.  The reservation format has now changed, which is appreciated because it used to be impossible to get a reso! Looking forward to my next dining experience."}
{"text":"Finally after all the hassle of continuously trying to book early on first Tues of the month at 10am sharp for 6 months, I was able to secure a booking of table of 5.  It was a struggle as the reservation require a deposit and the mental commitment of dropping like $800 for a dinner with family.  At one point, I was thinking should I ditch them and just go with my mom?  But then family is family, oh well.  That's where a portion of my pay check will go to instead of to Lululemon or something that month.  Finally the wait of 2 months was over, and it's the big day.  I remembered I was excited the night before and reading most of the yelp review ahead of time, specifically for the low ones so I don't expect too much.  The service was nice.  Just nice.  Comparing their service with Edulis, the latter is better.  Don't get me wrong.  The hostess downstairs greet you warmly.  You have the perks to choose your dinner napkins color to start with.  They aced on keep changing your utensils at every course.  They are cheerful and did explain every course, though not as good as Edulis (you can barely hear them).  Your cup was never left empty.  What set the difference between them and others, was basic placement.  The utensils have to be on the left for everyone.  It is awkward to have one guests set on the left, and other on the right, when everyone is right handed.  Also they did not follow the one side rule.  As in if you serve one guest from the left, every guest should follow the same.  To me that is a weird pattern throughout the whole dinner that just makes the service awkward and far from any fine dining expectation.  The beverage?  We got the crushed cranberries juice.  It was pretty good, tones of crushed ice, and not good enough for me to miss it.  We did not get any alcohol.  The food?  It is OK.  The ingredients are fresh.  Was there any dish memorable?  Nope.  I have high expectations on the bread as other reviews says it was divine.  I love the bread in NYC Bouley so much better.  The presentation is fancy, but it was just as nice as any other NYC restaurant like Eleven Madison Park, or even a typical western restaurant in Japan.  The (no gender) bathroom is clean and nice.  Some special flowers inside.  No automated Japanese toilet or fancy decoration.  Old worn towels that should change.  No wow factor beyond it was hidden behind a sliding door like behind a wall.  Nothing more special than Morimoto in NYC.  For Canadian restaurants fine dinning, I'd prefer Canoe or Edulis.  The former with nice view and I won't go hungry (unless you sign up for summerlicious or Winterlicious).  The latter at least there is that one scallop dish I will die for.  I doubt I will return with that price tag."}
{"text":"Just mediocre restaurant in Toronto. I tried their bar menu; the dishes for the bar menu are made by the same chefs at the same kitchen according to their server.  I ordered what the server recommended.  First I had a toro tartare with uni. The texture of the toast was soft and chewy, which I liked. I also got a glass of wine from Niagara, which was interesting because I had never tried wine from Niagara. Second, I had Agnolotti which included Manchego Cheese, potato and saffron. It was a bit heavy for me. Next, I had Salmon, which was cooked raw.  It was great.  Finally, I ordered their dessert: cheesecake with ice cream. It was interesting.  Overall dining experience at Alo was decent, but it did not \"wow\" me, also considering the price. I felt a little rushed and my expectation was higher as I read that this was considered the #1 restaurant in Toronto."}
{"text":"Alo is a spectacular restaurant. The best, by a significant margin, in Toronto, and truly one of the best in North America.   18 months into a two year sojourn in Toronto, we have struggled a little to find restaurants that compare in quality and creativity to what we have enjoyed in San Francisco. While Toronto prides itself on its dining scene, we've found many places that are good, but few that are exceptional, and often feel that there is an over-reliance on the space and image rather than nailing the more complex combination of elements that define excellence. We have tried hard, and consistently worked through various lists of the top rated restaurants in the city. For the context of this review, our favorites prior to our visiting Alo have been Dandylion, Edulis, and at the other end of the spectrum, Patois and Playa Hacienda.  We ate at Alo's chef's table this week: a small bar/counter facing the open kitchen that seats six side by side. The entrance to the (upstairs) restaurant is wonderfully unobtrusive, a pleasant change in a city that often values street presence and high styled architecture. There is no pretense in the outer wrapper here.  Once seated, it was immediately apparent that Alo was somewhere special. A choice of napkin was a unique little opener that pleased my wife, who noted that white linens often leave lint on black clothing. It was smart and beautifully executed. The front of house staff - the gentleman I believe was the maitre d' - was superb - understated, professional yet welcoming in a manner that one only finds in the very best restaurants. I will struggle for the words, but is no pretense, just warm, welcoming professionalism. You know it when you see it and it feels exactly right.   The kitchen staff, working in front of us, were similar - quietly effective, engaged and busy - each with a clear sense of purpose. Not a lot of talking, just focused efficiency and obvious pride.  We enjoyed the wine pairings with dinner, and the wine choices were not only creative and interesting, but delivered with wonderful passion and enthusiasm by the sommelier. This is not a place that needs or wants you to be drinking thousand dollar burgundies to enjoy your meal. The wine selections were thoughtful and beautifully suited to the food, and we came away with an expanded vision of what we might consider at our own table.  The food? Just perfect. I can't provide the litany of tastes and flavors that we had in what was at least a dozen courses, but let me just say that it flowed perfectly, included some spectacular tastes, and was just the right amount of food. Chef Patrick Kriss is beautifully creative and in our meal, found just the right weight and subtlety in each dish to leave you dazzled but satiated. There were no weak plates in the meal.  The staff interaction, by numerous members of the team, as one would see at a Keller or Daniel Patterson restaurant, was flawlessly executed. The music, a perfect soundtrack homage to Kriss's rocking Scarburian roots.  The meal reminded us in many ways of our early experiences at Saison in San Francisco - a unique combination of understatement with spectacularly creative, beautifully executed food. The professionalism and excellence of the restaurant made less intimidating by the Fleetwood Mac soundtrack. Saison vaulted from nowhere to two Michelin stars, and now, with an architectural minimalist venue to match, three stars. That Saison could dethrone The French Laundry as the Bay Area's top restaurant is a testimony to the subtlety involved in delivering one of the best meals you have ever had in a venue and forum in which you immediately feel comfortable. Patrick Kriss has that touch. Michelin may not have Canada in their world view, but make no mistake, he is destined for great things."}
{"text":"Alo lives up to the hype!! If you want a reservation for chef's table, you can't make it online, it has to be through the phone. It took at least 5 different days of trying before I finally got through on the phone. Make sure you call at 11am, at least 60 days out from the dates that you want it for.   From the moment we walked in the door, the service was impeccable. From getting the elevator, taking our jackets, getting us seated, transitions between plates, and having our jackets and elevator ready at the door, it was completely SEAMLESS. And what's even more is that for such a high-class restaurant, the atmosphere wasn't stuffy. It was fun, classy and comfortable.  We got the chef's table 10-course meal with the wine pairings. There were some dishes where we would take a bite and our eyes would roll to the back of our heads because it was so mind-blowingly good. It started with the very first starter, a tray of three mini appetizers to start and at the bottom was a foie gras terrine. Tiny, tiny sugar-cube sized foie gras with crispy wafers on either side for easy handling, but omg, it was incredible!! And this is from someone who is wary of foie gras as it can be really hit or miss with the texture and flavour, but this, this I would eat that all day, err'day.  A recurring theme for me was that Patrick Kriss takes simple home-style dishes and just pushes it to a whole other level of perfection. For example, their simple bread and butter dish. I love bread, bread is always great - but I did not know bread could be THAT GOOD! But to be fair, not every dish will blow your mind, some will just be solidly good. But even as I'm thinking about the meal as a whole, I am so excited to try it again, if I'm so lucky to get the chance. Also, if you can, get the wine pairings because their sommelier's selections are very, very good.  The bill for 2 people after tax came out to $500, which I thought was really reasonable considering it was 10-courses + wine pairings. Expensive, yes, but totally worth it."}
{"text":"Bar at Alo  No reservations required/possible  Cute area: can sit at the bar, or in a seperate seating area or on the window ledges (turned into mini seating area)  Food: around 10-12 items, tapas style on the bar menu. Can easily have a meal. Managed to get some spare bread buns from the main dining area, oh gawd, hands down the most memorable item. Alongside buca's bread knots some of the best bread in the province. That said, food was good, but not mind blowing.    Beverages: a better by the glass vino list is desired.  Service: friendly, attentive (given we're seated in the bar) and accommodating.   Overall: not mind blowing, but happy we ditched dailo for Bar at Alo. I can't say I'm bursting with excitement to try the tasting menu, but we will give it a shot.  Overall:3.75/5"}
{"text":"Where have you been Alo all my life. Boyfriend took me her for my birthday, and we were so impressed. We already know where we're coming for anniversaries ;). Albeit on the pricier side (save this for a special occasion), the food was mouthwatering and very unique. Restaurant catered to our allergies which was really nice. I highly recommend doing the wine pairing. Every wine they brought out paired very well with the dishes. If you're lucky, try booking a seat at the chef's table. Space is limited.   Only complaint- why do you have to reserve 2 months in advance?!?!"}
{"text":"Absolutely above and beyond expectations. The best restaurant experience I've had, from hospitality to dishes. All in all excellent. It's not surprising to see that alo is considered as one of, if not, the best restaurant in Canada."}
{"text":"We had a very good time. It's really about a combination. A top notch tasting menu, a professional and attentive service and a welcoming atmosphere."}
{"text":"What a treat to dine at Alo!  I didn't know what to expect!  The space is a really cool upstairs and it was intimate.  The service was impeccable.  I don't think I've ever had service like that in Toronto.  The prix fixe was reasonable for what we got in terms of quality and type of food.  Most memorable was the crab grits, the bread (!!), lobster and the rib eye.  Then 3 dessert rounds came out.  Portions are small but we were STUFFED.  Returning in a few months for my husband's birthday!"}
{"text":"The hustle of making the 2 months in advance reservation is worth it for a special occasion. A staff member reached out to me few days before our reservation to take note of any dietary restrictions. I mean come on! Talk about setting the stage for a royal treatment. The service at the restaurant is impeccable. Friendly staff, polite, and knowledgable. What else can you ask for? I really felt that everyone we interacted with during our dinner was trying their best to give us a memorable experience and that was just what they were able to accomplish. We even got a sweet table right by the window for prime picture  I remember the overall experience more so than the food.  It was a 12 course tasting menu. None of the dishes were \"omg so wow. Will remember this meal forever!!\". That's not to say that it was anything less than extraordinary. I do remember one of the appetizers and can still taste the fusion of familiar and unfamiliar flavours and thinking damn this is amaze! To keep it short I didn't think the culinary experience was that amazing and there were definitely some dishes that I didn't want to finish. However because my experience was so memorable I can't give this restaurant anything less than a 4 star rating."}
{"text":"I booked this restaurant 2 months back and finally got to come here for my boyfriend's birthday today. We had the tasting menu, where we originally walked in without knowing what we would have for dinner.  Overall the food was incredible !!! Every dish was good - this restaurant does not disappoint!! The service was excellent - everyone that works there are super friendly.  They take such good care of your dietary restrictions as well!!  Here is our tasting menu that we had today:  - potato, sea urchin - hearts of palm, pear, coconut, finger lime - choice of ocean trout / hokkaido sea scallop ( sashimi style ) - quebec foie gras - choice of hamachi or quail ballotine - choice of St. Canut rack of pork or Beef ribeye - grapefruit, elderflower, vanilla - honey crisp apple pie with ice cream - dark chocolate mint  Everything on this menu was impeccable and definitely worth the money !!  Just keep in mind that this restaurant has a 2 months policy.. make sure you book 2 months in advance as this restaurant is always fully booked !!"}
{"text":"You feel like your stepping into a membership only club when walking into Alo. The bar takes you back in time. The mixologist will whip you up an eclectic alcoholic dream. The tasting menu was a treat and every bite made my tastebuds dance a little. A great place to take a date you really want to impress"}
{"text":"Went here tonight to celebrate a special occasion with my boyfriend, and my first experience there was lovely. The food was amazing and credit goes to the chef for creating innovating and delicious dishes for us to try.  We went in for the tasting menu and was quickly seated. Although it was a full house, the service was perfect and food was delicious. Both my boyfriend and I liked the scallops and crispy pork belly very much. Each sauce created a different experience. It is on the pricier side but unlike other high end places I've been to that have missed the mark, in my opinion this is definitely worth the price tag and revisit!"}
{"text":"Dining here is an experience. They only offer a tasting menu and I would say 90% of the dishes were really good and a few of those really blew me away. However, what makes this restaurant 5 stars is the service. Everyone from the hostess to the wait/kitchen staff was incredible and it really turned my time at Alo from regular dining out to a fantastic experience. Kudos to the whole team for being so great about making last minute adjustments for my friend who is off dairy for her baby (I should have called ahead to let them know but got so busy at work. My oversight)."}
{"text":"Did the tasting menu - $105 for 10 courses and 2 cannapes. So worth the price for the quality of food and exceptional service!  Food is very creative and has a lot of high end ingredients like foie gras, black truffle, uni, and more.  Service is like dining at 3-Michelin star restaurant with water being refilled without asking, table being cleaned each course, staff pulling your chair for you when you leave and come back.  Really recommend this place. Lighting is dim unless you eat at Chef's Table."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service!! This truly deserves to be the number one restaurant in Canada. We had the wine pairing with it as well, highly recommended! The waiters were extremely attentive and were able to accommodate food allergies were nicely. Would definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"Came here a year ago so this review is a bit out of date. Since then, Alo has raised its tasting menu price from $80 to $105 but has also added a course to its meal. As my favorite restaurant in Toronto used to be Splendido (closed down in 2015), I had high expectations coming into this meal as the key players in their kitchen (including the chef and co-owner) came from Chef Victor Barry's restaurant, in addition to spending some time honing their skills at some of North America's finest (notably, Eleven Madison Park and Daniel).   Overall, while none of the dishes came short from an execution standpoint, I did feel that the menu was too safe and fell short on creativity and difficulty. Further, with only four courses, I did expect larger courses than what is typical of tasting menus at fine dining restaurants, but that was not the case. In the end, I felt a bit shortchanged due to the portion sizes and number of courses.   The best part of the meal was the bread, although the bread was fantastic so I don't necessarily mean that as an insult. I would definitely recommend that Toronto foodies give Alo a try, but I would definitely shy away from saying it's Toronto's best restaurant as many others have suggested."}
{"text":"Apart from my two-penneth worth, nothing more to add!  The best tasting menu in Toronto, super great and interesting wines, and beautiful service. Sit at the pass if you can."}
{"text":"There is nothing I can add to the long list of glowing reviews of Alo that hasn't already been said. But I will continue to add because this place deserves all of the praise it is getting.  It is elegant and upscale without being stuffy and pretentious. Yes they ask you choose your own napkin, and everything from the food to the wine is explained in detail that you question everything you thought you knew about food.  But take one bite out of a beautiful dish of broccoli and lemon that is so complexly created yet flavours so familiar, every thought will vanish.   It is a 4 course menu, with a choice of two for each course, but they also sneak in two amuse bouche, a bread course, a palette cleanser, and then a dessert. For $95 it is an absolute steal considering the quality and execution of the food. my palette cleaner was a sunchoke sorbet... sunchokes! it was fantastic. Amuse bouche 1 was the most amazing gougere I had ever eaten - little pops of heaven. There was also beef tendon chips, mussels, lobster and duck -  all excellent.  We got the light wine pairing (wine paired with your 4 mains, none with dessert or the bread) and a little cork snuck into my glass. I didn't even notice it was there, but as soon as it was poured it was whisked away for fresh glass. The attention to detail was spectacular,  Even the washrooms are beautiful! with the softest toilet paper.  Make a reservation, enjoy real food prepared by people who know how to treat everything with respect. Drink the wine. And feel so incredibly happy that a world class restaurant is in the best city."}
{"text":"This will sound redundant when compared to other reviews but this restaurant is amazing. The food coupled with the service and atmosphere makes it well worth the wait and price.   We came here for our anniversary and there were small touches that made our dinner all the more special. It sounds small but having the waiters greet you and wish you a happy anniversary as well as a greeting on the menu makes the experience special.  The 10 course meal will keep you full. The portions are small but we were so fully by the end of it. We only ordered a glass of wine each so it was ~$115 per person.   We did have to wait for a reservation to open up and booked right at 12am so just a warning that you will need to plan in advance. You could always see if there is a spot at the bar and you might get lucky.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant for special occasions."}
{"text":"Damn.  The rest of the reviews sum it up. It's not that expensive (considering other restaurants), it's damn delicious, and you don't feel rushed (nor do you feel like you have to wait too long).  The escargot was the best I've ever had, and a few other dishes also made me go \"damn.\"  Best part is that it's not pretentious, so it was a very comfortable meal.  One tip - gonna do bar service next time. The kitchen is right next to it, so a very cool vantage point to see all the food made."}
{"text":"What can I say. The best in Canada. The menu is highly developed and the chef's talents are supurb. All I can say is get a reservation and be prepared to be lifted up on a culinary cloud."}
{"text":"Was fortunate to dine at Alo Restaurant last night at the chef's counter where I had the blind tasting. 13 courses PLUS canapés to start as well as an amazing and decadent  cheese course (Délice de Bourgogne - cow's milk cheese from the Burgundy region of France). Watching the chefs in the kitchen was like seeing a special show, a lively dance, so wonderfully choreographed. It was quite the experience.  My compliments to Chef Patrick Kriss,      Co-owner *along with the very  personable GM, Amanda Bradley* and the entire team at Alo. I felt not just a welcomed guest but a VIP at that. While the food was beyond amazing, both in presentation and flavour, it is the beautiful service that I received that will make me return. (As an fyi to make a reservation for the chef's counter call the restaurant directly at 10:00 a.m. 60 days prior to the date you want. The cost per person was $130 + $85 for the wine pairing, which I did not partake in as I was driving but my counter mates kept raving what an amazing job the sommelier did at pairing each dish.)"}
{"text":"I highly anticipate going to Alo since it is the number one ranking restaurant im Toronto and a friend made a reservation 2 months ahead of time.  I really want to know what the fuss is all about.  Upon entering, we were greeted by a friendly staff who direct us toward the elevator.  The restaurant is on the third flour.  The decor is really just like a high end bar similar to the setup in a hotel.  The open kitchen was quite interesting as you can see how each of the staff works to prepare you dishes.  It was a tasting menu consisting of nine dishes.    The staffs were really professional, but there were smiling much.  I guess that's the tone they want to set at the restaurant.  I did find the music volume to be too loud for my liking as I need to talk louder in order for my friend to hear me.    The appetizer with cube foie gras was interesting, and the choux pastry with savoury filling was quite good.  The presentations were awesome for all dishes.  They were all carefully plated; however, I did find a lot dishes lack just a touch of salt.  The highlights for me  was the soft melt -in-your-mouth ribeye steak.  It was just done to perfection with proper seasoning.  And the coconut dessert, caramelized white chocolate and yogurt was light yet memorable.    I actually did not like the style of serving as I felt a the servers were not warm and friendly; however, they were all extremely professional.  The hidden washroom was kind of weird as the sliding door outside needs some lubricant as it did not slide easily.    For $150 plus 15% tips, I expected more tasty food, but it was an experience to remember."}
{"text":"We were there for a dinner to celebrate friend's birthday. After reading all the reviews online, my expectation is very high. I am a huge fan of splendido, and I expect alo to be better. The food is good, but none of a course gave me a 'wow'... that's the reason for 4 star.. Consider the price $ 89 vs splendido $180...  I think alo still worth to try."}
{"text":"Very impressive. It's unusual for that neighbourhood to exhibit such talent and wonderful customer service, so it actually throws you for a moment. Beautiful place, beautiful food, wonderful and genuine staff, and absolutely killer cocktail list. New favourite for special occasions for sure."}
{"text":"The most challenging reservation experience! Tried 3 times to book the table, fortunately the food did not disappoint us (overall). Very friendly service (you bet), good music, comfortable environment. Great cocktails!  One of the starters contain foie gras and ginger. The foie gras was smooth and delicious but dont think it matches well with ginger (or maybe it's just I don't like ginger). Highly prized pain au lait was definitely one of my favorite items. The soup with mussels and potato was also delicious and filling. But I think the desserts need some improvement. I would expect something more interesting than a dark chocolate cake with coffee mousse from a restaurant like alo."}
{"text":"Possibly my favorite tasting menu in Toronto yet (either this place or George... the two are very close). I'm surprised it only has just over 20 reviews, although not surprised at all by the 5 star rating.   Came here for an anniversary dinner. First of all, the service here is excellent. I'm usually not too picky about service, but it really has to be acknowledged in this case.   I believe the only option at the restaurant is the tasting menu. Its a \"4 course\" menu for $89 (wine pairing is an additional $65). I read online that there's an option to do an extended tasting menu at the chef's bar, so you can see the chefs at work. May return to try this (this would need a reservation well in advance). But the regular tasting menu is a decent amount of food.   Each course of the tasting menu has 2 choices. So my wife and I selected differently each time, and shared. Everything was delicious, and also the plating (including the plates themselves) was interesting. In addition to the 4 courses, there is a \"bread\" course that comes with this really buttery bread, as well as an amuse bouche, 2 \"rounds\" of desserts, and an \"amuse bouche\" for the dessert!.   I'm not a big wine drinker, but decided to do the wine pairing. Would definitely recommend that. Each wine did compliment its course well. And each course (including the bread course and amuse bouche), except for the dessert amuse bouche had a pairing. So it's a fair amount of wine.   The whole experience takes about 2.5-3hrs, but I did feel that time went a lot quicker than it did at George, where it seemed like we were waiting forever between courses.   The only suggestion would be perhaps to add on something a little extra for the special occasions. The menu said \"Happy Anniversary\" on the back, but that was about it. That being said, I was very happy overall."}
{"text":"Alo was a flawless dining experience. No wonder this restaurant is ranked as the best in Toronto and one of the top in Canada and the world!    Upon being greeted by name, I felt welcome as a guest. I was truly impressed by the professionalism but yet non-pretentious atmosphere.   The attention to details is unparalleled. The staff moved around as if they were in a choreographed dance. Choice of napkin, dark or white? Choice of complimentary water, sparkling or still? Each member of the staff had a role and there was never any overlap. Perfection.   For drinks... We didn't opt for the wine pairings. (You should!) I ordered the berries and crushed ice (how does something so simple taste so good?) and my husband ordered an old fashioned (amazing).  Moving on to the food... 4 bites for the amuse bouche. Each had a balance of taste and texture. Were they petite? Yes. But those small morsels just left me wanting more! At this point, I knew the actual dishes would be impeccable.   If I were to describe every single dish, this review would never end.  They were all hits, there were no misses. That aged beef ribeye tartare was out of this world. Agnolotti were pockets of flavour explosions. Everything was presented beautifully, cooked perfectly, and seasoned well. We were definitely full by the end of the tasting menu. My only regret is that I didn't come to this restaurant sooner!    It was well worth the two month wait!  I will most definitely book again for the fall to try a different menu. Alo deserves 5 stars and nothing less. I loved it!"}
{"text":"This place is no joke.  I had to book months in advance and all I got was 530 pm on a Tuesday, so definitely plan ahead if you're hoping to get the tasting menu here (which you should!).  First, their reservation system is great.  They respond to emails which is always a plus.  They call and confirm.  I had requested to sit at the chef's bar (something else you should also do), and they were booked there, but called me a few days ahead to let me know they could in fact seat me there.  I appreciated their ease of communication.  The space itself is like a hidden speakeasy.  The entrance is off of Spadina, and the restaurant is floating above Hero Burger.  There is a hostess just inside the entrance way, in case you are lost.  Then you take a creepy elevator up three floors and the space itself is beautiful.    The service here is bar none.  Friendly. Efficient. Impeccably.  Everyone is paying attention to everything at all times.  And yet non intrusive.  Man - I could go on and on.  I haven't had service this good in Toronto in a million years.  I'd give them 5 stars just for that.  Bravo, FOH team. BRAVO.  Here are some random thoughts before getting to the food: - the bathrooms here are some of the nicest ones I've ever seen. I loved that they have a full length mirror in each stall, although I have heard they use distorted mirrors so you think you look better than you actual do which is kind of weird (Oh! and the bathrooms are hidden so a server will lead you/follow you) - the bar stools were quite comfortable facing the kitchen - the kitchen can get quite warm so wear layers - you don't get a number for your coat, but they know exactly when you are leaving  So the food - definitely sit at the chef's table, it's so much fun to watch food come out although I think that it was most fun because we were the first people in the restaurant (obvi, at 530) so none of our courses were \"ruined\" but all were surprises.    We did the wine pairings and that was very, very worth it. I was a little sad because I love bold reds, and none of the wines were like that, but you do get wine with every single course - so be prepared to get sauced!  Interesting and rare wines I'd never seen before.  The sommelier was very knowledgeable and passionate.  Now, the food. I don't want to ruin any surprises but it is seafood heavy (or, ours was).  Our favourite dish was probably the uni, so you do have to be a bit adventurous.  I've never liked uni before in Japanese preparation, so this was really interesting to me!    I would highly recommend this restaurant for special occasions.  The final bill for two extended tastings, plus wine pairings, plus tax and tip was $500!  For two of us....hope my dining companion appreciated it!  :)"}

{"text":"My husband Matt B. and I started dating on 10/14/09, and we happened to be in Toronto for the first time on 10/14/17. It was a quick trip, so we decided to make the most of our one night in town, pinning an epic meal at Alo to the semi-special occasion of our eighth dating anniversary.  This took a bit of planning, namely a calendar reminder to get on OpenTable at 10AM PST on the first Tuesday of September, when reservations opened up for the whole month of October. I was ready and waiting when the clock turned, and this still felt like a crap shoot. I snagged a 9:45 reservation and felt lucky to have it.  We showed up a few minutes late, but fortunately, this wasn't a problem. We checked in downstairs and were led into an elevator, which we shared, incidentally, with chef and co-owner Patrick Kriss. The restaurant was on the third floor, and it felt kind of nice and tucked away from the rainy city outside. We were greeted immediately, our jackets and umbrellas whisked away. We waited for a couple minutes in the bar area before being led into the lovely main dining room. It was a great space, comfortable and sleek, with an open kitchen and a relaxed but upscale ambiance.  Service was flawless all the way through. Both our waiter and our sommelier were friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive, and the sizable staff made sure every possible need was anticipated and met. I must've mentioned this was an anniversary date, because we were welcomed with complimentary glasses of sparkling rose.  Alo is tasting menu only, at least in the dining room, so we had few decisions to make. One of these was whether we wanted a wine pairing with our meal. We went for it, and it definitely enhanced the experience. The wines were all great and the pairings considered and well presented. Also, wine pairings are super fancy and fun.  The food was exquisite. We started with a quartet of beautiful little bites: warm gougeres with aged cheddar and apple purée; foie gras with candied maple and bourbon; foie gras rolled in tiny rice crispies. Then a trio of larger amuse bouches, served with a splash of brut. Toro tartare with toasted nori emulsion and yuzu kosho, served on a shiso leaf to form a bite-sized green taco; a brothy, umami-rich dish of baby white shrimp with jellied dashi, kombu, and fermented bamboo shoot; salty, silky Ibérico lomo draped over fragrant musk melon and field tomatoes.  The next few courses brought seafood and pasta, leading us into the meat of the meal. Delicate Hokkaido sea scallop sashimi came with green tomato and Himrod grape, dressed with brown butter, lemon verbena oil, and edible flowers. Light but decadently flavored, served with Chenin Blanc from Vouvray. We had a Greco Di Tufo, an Italian white wine, with our grilled Lamèque oyster with pomme purée, smoked butter, and nasturtium. This was a nice dish with some good contrasting textures, the oyster and a sprinkle of bread crumbs layered with the rich, creamy potato. The pasta was superb--substantial, pliant packets of ricotta agnolotti in a buttery, cheesy parmesan chanterelle sauce, served with chanterelle mushrooms, Piedmont hazelnuts, pickled endive, and a robust Piedmont white wine.  Then, the fish and meat. Alo was exceptional through and through, but the Ora King salmon was the high point of our meal. This was the best piece of cooked fish I've ever had. It was cured with shio koji and finished in the oven, and it was phenomenally buttery and flavorful, just unreal. Served with Japanese sweet potato purée, maitake mushroom confit, honshimeji mushrooms, and wakame, along with a New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc. The 60-day dry-aged ribeye was also superb, a tender-to-melting piece of beef with sunchoke, spinach brown butter purée, braised pearl onion, and sauce Choron, a tomato-spiked version of Béarnaise. This came with our first red of the night, a hearty Rhône blend, as well as some pain au lait--soft, fresh milk bread with fleur de sel and house cultured butter.  We said yes please to the optional cheese course, a gorgeous round of creamy, lightly tangy Délice du Bourgogne layered with cured plum, pistachio, and tarragon, served with toasted baguettes and a Tuscan Cabernet Franc. A crisp palate cleanser of cucumber lemon purée and sorbet with juniper, kaffir lime, and champagne took us into dessert. There was apple purée with yeast caramel crumble, caramelized sheep's whey ice cream, and Granny Smith apple, a nice, lightly fruity dessert paired with a French dessert wine. Then, to end this incredible meal, a delicious assembly of macadamia purée, caramelized white chocolate crumble, coconut ice cream, macadamia espuma, and finger lime, with a sweet, strong apertif wine.  Alo is #1 on Canada's 100 Best Restaurants list for 2017. I've eaten at maybe ten restaurants in Canada, but I believe this wholeheartedly. This was a marvelous, extraordinary dinner. If you're visiting Toronto (or feeling fancy in your own city), plan ahead and book your table."}
{"text":"Truly the most surprising and amazing restaurant. The service was comparable to a 3 star Michelin restaurant. If any restaurant in Toronto could claim a 3 star rating it would be this. It'a not whether or not they will earn that accolade but rather when. Not to sound like a snob but I've dined at restaurant  Gordon Ramsey (3 Michigan starred) and I felt the food at Alo could definitely compete with that of Gordon Ramsey. Everything from the starting snack to the main and dessert are just on point. Truly happy with the experience and would recommend to anyone trying to create a memorable moment. 16/10  -Michelin Bound"}
{"text":"It would be hard to rate Alo anything less than five stars. It's definitely the priciest meal we've had in the city, but between the amazing attention to detail on every front from the reservations to the amazing service and often weep-worthy food and wine pairings, Alo has earned a reputation in Toronto as the place to dine for a special occasion.  This reputation is well earned.   For my birthday a few days ago, we made a reservation in early April and the only room they had was at the chef's table with the extended menu. This was actually perfect for my foodie soul. I'm generally not comfortable sitting on barstools, but I had no issue throughout our 3 hour meal.  The wine pairings are esoteric and whimsical but this only adds to the element of surprise and delight that this restaurant excels at. The menu is billed as 10 courses, but there are several intermezzos and palate cleansers. Service never missed a beat and the staff were far from stiff or canned in their demeanour. It was nice to go for a fabulous meal and feel that the people serving you were actual people who enjoy their jobs and have personality as opposed to following some corporate script. This is not to suggest that they are not knowledgeable, because they know their stuff.  On to the food... Simply amazing.  The portions are small, but within are such thoughtful meetings of texture and flavour. This is the sort of food that touches your mind as well as your body and to me, there is nothing sexier. Meaty chanterelles in a luxurious cream bath; stuffed morels; dungeness crab with hearts of palm; raw and seared waygu beef; silky hokkaido scallop-- all of these items were prepared with such subtle expertise and care and the context of the wine pairings allowed for an even more sensual journey.  Alo is a very special place and I would highly recommend it to foodies who are celebrating a special occasion or the adventurous patron who wants to wow an out of town guest. The bar looked nice and it would be a great place for a couple of impressive cocktails and snacks.  If you splurge on one restaurant in the city right now, make sure it's Alo."}
{"text":"The Anticipation We were told by my boyfriend's friend that THIS is the restaurant to go to, at least if you are from Toronto. He raved about it as the most godly restaurant and experience ever. We were obviously blown away. It seems like he has visited many other restaurants in the past, especially those that were in fine dining and it gave us some hope. We love eating. Not like we are amazing critics ourselves, but we couldn't wait to make our mark at Alo. The reservation process is deadly, we had to wait 3 months before our scheduled spot. Believe it or not, it's like buying tickets to a Beyonce concert, every night at 12am I'm on OpenTable trying to get the next available time slot. To my dismay, the only time I could get was at 9:30pm. What a bummer.  On the night of our reservation, Toronto was blessed with the worst weather ever lol. Anyhow, we were freezing and tried to stay indoors as long as possible at a Toronto library. When we finally stepped foot into the restaurant, we were relieved. But even though we arrived early (15 minutes prior), we still have to wait a bit before our table was ready - and that's okay. It seems like they were well equipped to serve people who came in early, small cushions near the window with a nicely lit bar in the middle.  Service This is where I will say I agree with the majority. Service was great, I love everyone's attitude and attention to detail. At points throughout our stay, I did find it a little overwhelming that so many different individuals were contributing to our night. From one girl handing out our napkins, to a completely different person cleaning table, and finally our waiter (who was my fave btw) that zipped in and out throughout the night. Don't fret, I'm not complaining, it was unique, but I'm a little traditional and wish we had less people serving us throughout the night. With less people, I felt I could probably make a better connection. Anyhow, service is still good, and I would give them lots of points for this.  Food How do I put it? It was a letdown, is that too harsh? No, I don't think so. While the artsy part of the dishes were obvious in each of the dishes, the taste was forgettable. It's like going to a gourmet burger place, only to be served with a Wendy's cheeseburger. Just because it looks better, doesn't mean it actually tastes good. I can tell that the chefs put a lot of effort into arranging the design, but do they know that the combination does not blend? Most of the dishes were either too sour or too salty. At one point, I couldn't even finish my meal because the sauce was so overwhelming, a pity. Don't get me wrong, all the dishes were edible. But for the price we were paying, edible doesn't cut it. When I come into a restaurant like this, I'm expecting to be wowed. I want something no less than my experience dining at Jacobs or Auberge du Pommier. I'm not expecting a Michelin Star experience, and I've had that in New York just a few days ago (which by the way Alo cannot match with their current dishes). I do not want to sound like I hate this restaurant, but I do have a few pointers. And obviously, I'm not a great chef so perhaps someone else can point out to me how I am clearly missing the target. But when food is too sour, too salty, that to me is not meeting my expectations."}
{"text":"Alo gets 5 stars as it really is an end to end culinary experience.  You can read the other reviews for what you get, but the menu will change and tends to be driven by Japanese ingredients.   We had a pregnant guest and they were able to make suitable substitutions for the raw ingredients.  The service is impeccable and this is an understatement - easily setting it apart from other restaurants.  The sommelier was also fantastic, telling us how to drink the wine with the meal.  Bottom line:  If it's a special occasion and you have money, AND you were mindful enough to get a reservation 2 months ahead of time, it's worth it.  Full wine pairing and tasting will run you ~$550 for 2."}
{"text":"Unfortunately you have to get a reservation 3 months in advance. Would love to try their chef menu. Oh well so came for bar food since it is cooked in the same kitchen. Food was good and well presented. The scallops were good just barely got any, they figured out a way to take a half of a scallop and make it a fancy dish but left wanting a lot more as it was expensive for what you get. Had the duck and that was good didn't like having to make lettuce tacos out of the ingredients as it was tough to put together and eat. Still good food and good drinks and great service. The dessert was the best to me. It was some banana gnocchi i think. Whatever it was it was delightful! I will definitely try to do a reservation as i want to experience the real menu."}
{"text":"Situated on what I refer to as \"Burger Corner\", Alo is more than just a welcome addition to this part of the neighbourhood: It's one of the finest restaurants in the entire city, joining a short list which in my opinion includes The Black Hoof, George, Splendido and Edulis. The staff who are delightful and professional in their own right are all bright-eyed and bushy-tailed one week into being open, and our server declared it an honour to be working under Patrick Kriss (formerly of Acadia, at which I had also eaten but with which I was not as impressed).   The ambiance is unpretentious, simply decorated and dimly lit. While they could use a painting or two in a couple areas (if you're an owner/manager and you're reading this, I'd be happy to create custom work for you: http://www.sarimichellerichter.com/), it's incredibly refined and comfortable.  The five-course prix fixe meal offered two options for most courses, so naturally, my dining partner and I chose opposites so we could try every dish. The flavours were incredible despite very modestly sized portions. There was a great balance of sour, sweet, spice and richness. Worth mentioning in particular is the pain au lait with fleur de sel and house butter, the B.C. Dungeness Crab with black rice and pea shoots, and Yorkshire Pork with chard, grapes, ramps and mustard, as standouts. Fun amuse bouches and palate cleansers popped up between nearly every course, with the asparagus sorbet being the most innovative and exciting.   We asked our server about the bar menu and he brought it over for us to see -- if you were to order all the dishes between two people it just might constitute a meal. He stated it's still under development. We also inquired as to when the menu will be switched up and he said it will be a pretty constant evolution."}
{"text":"Let's start off with the service. The service is superb. This is the reason for the 5/5. The servers are friendly and very personable. We were lucky enough to sit at the counter in front of the kitchen (chef's table) which allowed us to see the food being prepared. We were able to talk to many of the staff and the manager. Absolutely no attitude here. They were here to make your dining experience the best.  This food here is very good but I would not say excellent (4.5/5). At the counter, we had to have a 10 course meal vs. the 7 course in the dining room so we got to try more.  Plus we had 4 desserts. The mushrooms, pork  and bread (yes bread) were excellent. Everything else was just very good.   The wine guy, Christopher, was great. I didn't have the wine pairing because it was mostly white wine which I don't like while the others I was with did. So, I had red wine and each time my friends got their wine, I also got a new red wine. The people I was with didn't like their wines but the reds I got were great. Christopher explained each wine in detail. I also had the vodka fix cocktail.  That was yummy."}
{"text":"Overall experience was great. The food started off very strong. My husband and I particularly enjoyed the small bites and amuse bouche, but the desserts were unfortunately quite disappointing. There was nothing exciting about the composition or flavours.   Service was excellent and the price was reasonable at $105 plus $65 for wine pairings per person."}
{"text":"Just as everyone else has mentioned, Alo is amazing! Rated the #1 restaurant in Canada's top 100, everything from the food, ambiance and service were excellent.   I was literally jumping up and down when my husband told me he was able to get us a 6:30 reservation on a Saturday to celebrate our 5 year wedding anniversary. I was extremely impressed that as soon as we entered the restaurant, everyone from our hostess to the waiters were all super friendly yet professional.   The pace of our dinner was perfectly timed and every single dish that came out was unimaginably delicious (except one dish). The taste, flavour and presentation were all perfectly executed.   The one dish that I didn't like was the tortellini dish. The pasta imo was bland and tasted like dough and the broth was way too salty. I didn't say anything because everything else was so great and my husband happily ate it up for me.   Every other dish tasted absolutely delicious! I love that you could taste the flavour of each ingredient and that they all complimented each other well.   Each plate came with a new set of utensils and every time you got up from your seat, they would come and fold up your napkin.   This was one of the most memorable meals I have ever had and I highly highly recommend everyone to try Alo at least once in their life. We know we'll definitely be back again :)"}
{"text":"I went to Alo last night and was blown away by the entire dining experience. From the food to the service to the atmosphere, the evening was perfect from start to finish. The menu was outstanding starting with canapés,  moving onto an amuse bouche, followed by 8 courses, the food was beautifully presented, thoughtfully executed and delicious. Being an avid restaurant goer in Toronto, I've tried amazing food in fantastic restaurants,  but this was a step above anything else I've experienced in this city. The service was Michelin-worthy and staff were incredibly attentive the entire 3 hours we spent there.  My favourite dish was a fois gras stew with mushrooms and a chicken jus - I have never eaten anything like it and it is a dish I will remember for the rest of my life. I can't recommend this restaurant enough. The price tag is steep but its a perfect place for a special occassion."}
{"text":"This is my second time at Alo since they opened. It's the closest to a Michelin star restaurant you will find in Toronto. Service was amazing, they even remember my name from last time we were there. They even had purse hooks for your bag brought out to you. Food is delicious and extremely well prepared. So many flavours and ingredients in each bite. The two of us did wine paring with the tasting menu + extra courses + drinks and spent over $600 before gratuity. I don't mind paying for quality you won't find anywhere in the city. The only thing I can recommend is if the portions could be a bit bigger or if there can be a few more courses. But I will be back and I will tell all my friends to give it a try!"}
{"text":"Excellent experience! From start to finish, you know that you are in the hands of professionals. Food prepared by masters of their crafts... wines from around the world and knowledgable, friendly staff made our visit one that we want to repeat as soon as possible."}
{"text":"Loved everything about the 3 hour experience.  The staff, food and overall atmosphere were phenomenal.  There's a casual elegance about the place - from the napkin selection to the plating (and stunning china / barware)  and the personalized menu to take home at the end of the meal.  I mentioned a walnut allergy during the confirmation phone call and the waiter confirmed the table would be walnut free when we arrived.  About 2hours into the amazing meal, before the dessert courses we were asked if we wanted to add the cheese plate - when it arrived it happened to have walnuts on it.  I mentioned the allergy and the waiter immediately whisked the plate away while apologizing profusely, this was followed up by most of the staff who attended to us that night apologizing INCLUDING Patrick Kriss!! The staff is just amazing.  Definitely Toronto's best fine dining experience and will definitely return (if we can get a reservation!)"}
{"text":"Round 2 at Alo was just as awesome as the first. Amanda and Patrick have created a wonderful experience from the food to the music to the service to the awesome interior design and comfy chairs. Lucky me got to sit at the corner seat at the counter to witness the best show in the city (sorry Leafs). Something I appreciate is the small amount of guests relative to staff which allows Alo to provide an unpretentious fine dining experience that Is so rare to find. I have such admiration for how hard this team has worked to reach the top of Canada's food scene so quickly. As for the food: wagyu and koshikari rice dishes were among the best things I've ever had and were the highlights for me. I hope to come back soon"}
{"text":"Highly sought out & rated restaurant. Seems almost impossible to book a reservation here. Luckily I was treated here for a birthday celebration back in 2015 prior to the extreme hype! This tasting menu did not disappoint! We sat at the bar & watched the chefs do their magic. Service was impeccable & each dish was so well presented with an explanation. Must say it was an experience I will never forget. Fresh, decadent & mouthwatering dishes one after another. Would love to come back again if reservations were possible!"}
{"text":"What an experience! Leaves you absolutely speechless. Dined here the second week it opened and ever since haven't had a similar experience in Toronto. Recent dinner no exception.  Highly recommend you go with the phenomenal wine pairing option! Yet to try the chef's counter - next trip hopefully."}
{"text":"Came here for the tasting menus and it was absolutely amazing. One of us had the vegetarian menus and it turned out to be stellar! The other two of us had the regular menu and it was gourmet too. Service is too notch too. No wonder is ranked No.1 in Canada!"}
{"text":"The Quebec foie gras was so smooth and actually tasted like foie gras ice cream to me at first bite.  It was just so incredibly smooth and didn't resemble the typical grainy texture of foie gras to me at all.  The Asian Pear was very juicy and in a tiny shape of a teardrop.  Everything was so fine and minuscule.  The Koshihikari Rice tasted like a rice cracker while the Nori was just dry seaweed.  Overall, for this dish, I loved the texture of the foie gras and its uniqueness!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! NOTHING LIKE THIS IN TORONTO!!!! Worth the 2 month wait for reservations !"}
{"text":"Wow what a culinary experience!!! We did the tasting menu and it was marvelous.  The menu came with 4 courses but like the French, always a pleasant surprise it was really like a 7 course meal.    My favourite on the tasting menu was the Provençal White Asparagus, Ramps, Sorrel, Moutarde d'Orleans.  The smoothness of the asparagus is extraordinary.  The intercourse pain au lait was buttery and warm, just a touch battery and perfect.  Another winner was the Sea Scallops, Radish, Vadouvan- it's blended in a curry spice blend and the scallops were cooked to perfection. Oh and the Provini Veal - melt in your mouth veal!  Least favourite for me: Pacific Halibut tasted a bit fishy, consistency was good or may it was because I hit a wall. The duck was very tasty but a touch dry. The wine pairing were awesome but the portions were huge, we were getting wasted half way through, I only lasted to the 3rd course and I couldn't have anymore!  Not a bad thing I guess, I wish I could have had more.   The wine pairings, were amazing. The Sommelier was very knowledgable and told the story behind each wine.  The service was one of the best I've seen in the city.  They are swift and predict all your moves before you do them.  They are subtle and make you feel so important but not in a flashy way.  Kudos to the chef whom we didn't get to meet and the service staff that made us feel at home.  The ambiance was amazing, very cozy and had a good home feel. The music wasn't pretentious, was a mixture of rock and rap.    It was an amazing culinary dining experience and such a gem in Toronto.  Go for the whole gamut- tasting menu and wine pairing."}
{"text":"Alo Restaurant is one of the best fine dining restaurants in Toronto. It boost great service and an inspired tasting-menu that's on par with Michelin Starred restaurants. It is extremely hard to get a reservation at Alo so plan well in advance (i.e. months in advance).   Alo is located in Spadina Ave. behind a Hero Burger - an old place for a upscale restaurant. Alo feels relaxed despite being a fine dining restaurant. Its design is trendy and modern.  The chef tasting menu is inspired. The dishes transition between French, Italian and American seamlessly. It plays on classics. The dishes are creative and innovative. The ingredients are fresh and flavourful. The price for the tasting menu is on par with many of the other tasting menus seen at Michelin Starred restaurants.   Alo is an oasis above the hustle and bustle of the city."}
{"text":"This place is all the good things people review about. Despite making reservations 2 months ago, we finally sat down last night and enjoyed the 5 course tasting menu plus the 3 dessert dishes.   Despite the recommends, I didn't do the wine pairing. The server indicated it was predominately whites, which included ice wines and some glasses of ports. Unfortunately I prefer my reds so I made my own choices.   The detail they put into this meal as well as the service overall are top notch. The city just doesn't do it like that anymore. I got up twice within the 3 hours we were there and every time I was approaching the table there was someone there to pull my chair out and tuck me in.   We had dinner reservations at 6:15 and we left there by 9. Prepare to dine and relax. And it's worth every single second!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best dining experiences I've had in Toronto. The food was amazing and each course was so well prepared and planned. The service was spectacular. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, service was top notch. At one point, my husband dropped his napkin and we both hadn't even realized. However, one of the servers noticed right away and brought him a new napkin. They really pay attention to the small details to make your dining experience superb!"}
{"text":"Alo doesn't need my 5 star review amidst all the praise they have been receiving, but they will get it anyways.   Service? Amazing. You walk in through a door on the side of Hero Burger, which is on the south east corner of Spadina / Queen (even though North West is more trendy now, thanks to Kim and Kanye ... I digress). A pleasant lady, who somehow already knows your name, is waiting there and directs you onto a remarkably slow, but stable, elevator. Once you're on the third floor, someone else takes your coat, which is then miraculously available the moment you want to leave (which is basically never). In between this process, you will have a circulating round of waiters and waitresses fill your complimentary still or sparkling water, explain dishes to you one by one, as well as the significance of any wines you choose to order.   On that note, wine? We did the light pairing ($40), which paired exclusively with the savoury dishes. You have the option to do a more full wine pairing (I believe it was for 8 out of the 10 dishes for $65), or order a glass / bottle or a cocktail. Great wines. Lovely stories about the wines. Most were vintages (2013 seemed like a popular year). Plays well with the food.  Food? Unreal. It's a tasting menu (~10 courses) in the dining room. The chef(s) have the ability to take 1 ingredient and deliver it to you 3 different ways on the same plate beautifully. Do note that the meals feature some less conventional fare, such as beef tongue, tendon ... Veal sweetbreads.. Snails.. It's tough to make me want to eat some of these things, but they were so delicious, it was hard to stop.   Finally, atmosphere? Lovely. 5 stars for the tables having more than 5 fingers of space between them.  Thanks to all the staff for the amazing meal!"}
{"text":"Solid 5 stars. I have been trying to come to this restaurant since my last birthday, but unfortunately my birthday landed on a Monday last year so I told my husband-2018!  I had a really bad day today but ALO just turned my day around! The scramble egg with Dungeness crab and uni was spectacular! I wanted to eat my husband's portion and the table of 6 beside me. Yes it was that good!   You know I find it when a dish is very good, it has the ability to leave a memory and a flavour at the tip of your tongue and this one just did it! The pork belly was AMAZING!!!! Again, I would take my husband's portion if he didn't finish it fast enough.  Well done!!! Every penny was well spent at this restaurant.   The wine pairing was great. The description of the wine delivered by the staff actually made you feel like you were going on a world tour! Very well done!  Service was excellent. The waiter was friendly, made you feel comfortable, attentive and very pleasant. I will come back in a heart beat!!!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best restaurants I've have been to in Toronto.  My first impression of the room, crowd, and service, made me feel like I was in NYC or Chicago at a Michelin star restaurant.  We had the full wine pairing, tasting menu with optional cheese course. All dishes were great, and some were spectacular!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service, with options to choose dishes from a prix-fixed menu. Reservations are required to be made 2 months in advance, and only available to be booked online. Seating is comfortable and spacious, and it never felt like a pretentious restaurant trying to cram too many snobby people into one place. Everyone there was present for the good food, and service was on point to ensure a good experience.   Alo is definitely one of my top 3 favourite restaurants in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Toronto needs more of these.  The food was very well made. Great ingredients. Amazing service.   And a lot less than I expected.  At 180 per person you get a lot !    It is a lot of food. For me at least. Very heavy dishes. Lots of cream and exotic ingredients.  If you can get a rezo you should go."}
{"text":"Went here for the second time. Was celebrating my husband's 50th with 5 others. We started in the bar  which was a nice way to lead into the dinner. The food  was incredible yet again. The service is perfect- unpretentious and friendly. We had a vegetarian in the group and I am not sure if he was thrilled with the menu but I do not  generally rely on vegetarians for my food reviews!  The sommelier helped with a  yummy choice of wines. My only complaint remains the decor- my seat pointed right in front of a really dirty window that I could not help being distracted by and I'd love to see tablecloths. These are minor issues because it remains the best restaurant I've been to in Toronto."}
{"text":"Great dining experience - definitely lived up to the hype! Service was top notch. I would recommend skipping the wine pairing."}
{"text":"This is an outstanding restaurant. First class in every category: food, wine and service. A real treat and as good as any meal we have had anywhere!"}
{"text":"Alo is easily my fav spot as i can not get enough of it. They only do tasting menu ($89), in my opinion, this is so good in value as the quality of food, creativity and service is excellent. I had been a few times, all the menu are different and A+++.  Wine choices are fab too, a la carte or a choice of $40 for all the main courses or $65 for all the courses, at this point, u might wanna get a cab home as you will b in heaven. No pun intended.   The only beef is if u had a date in mind, book early as it is always full. I book my res 2 months in advance each time."}
{"text":"Best of the best in Toronto! Had their tasting menu with wine pairing for my birthday. It was outstanding. I also took one of my friends there and sat and ordered from the bar menu. It was delicious."}
{"text":"There were 5 of us for dinner. We thoroughly enjoyed our experience; everything from the meal, to the wine, to the service was exceptional! We also noticed little touches, such as a printed copy of your menu that evening and having the staff greet us with our coats at the end of our experience. Can't wait to come back! And yes, it is worth the hype..."}
{"text":"I lucked out that we were able to get a reservation for Valentines Day. I had been trying to eat at Alo since last summer. If you're keen to get a reservation for a specific day, either go on Open Table at the stroke of midnight 60 days before your desired reservation date or I have also heard that enlisting the help of a concierge service can be an effective way of getting a reservation.   Let's talk about the calibre of this restaurant. They call you a few days before your scheduled reservation to confirm and to inquire about food allergies or intolerances. I was afraid that requesting a gluten reduced and dairy reduced menu would be restrictive and reduce the quality of the meal. It did not. I was advised however that if I could tolerate a bit of gluten that the bread course was \"to die for\", and I gratefully obliged. They have staff who are extremely attentive and it all seemed like a carefully orchestrated symphony they way utensils were changed with every course and water glasses refilled frequently.   This was the best $105 hubby and I spent per person  on a tasting menu, which included everything from seafood to duck breast to lamb to foie gras. They worked with my dietary restrictions and presented me with a customized meal that in no way suffered from a taste perspective. The highlights of my meal included the mushroom course (which replaced the mussels course with hollandaise sauce my husband was partaking in), and the duck breast and the lamb which were masterfully prepared and incredibly flavourful and tender. All of the components of the dishes were thoughtfully plated and married well from a flavour standpoint. The desserts were decadent. Even the palate cleanser was delicious and creative. Each dish surpassed the next and left you wanting more, yet at the end of the meal, we were left quite satiated. My husband's only regret was that there was only one delicious bread roll served as part of the bread course and we each could have easily eaten 2 or 3 of those with the house-churned butter. Would I eat here again? In a heartbeat!  4.5 stars  6/100 (2017)"}
{"text":"Memorable first time experience at Alo tonight for their tasting menu after a patient 3 month wait booked through Amex. Tbh it was not a super \"wow!!\" experience like I was expecting, but think my expectations have grown too unrealistic over time with so much lead up time and hype surrounding Alo.   Since I'm not a professional food critic or come even close to resembling one, just wanted to make a few comments about the overall experience-  1. Impeccable service. Why is it sooo expensive here ($105/person for the tasting menu)? Because you'll be spoiled rotten all night by all the staff constantly refilling your water, opening doors, replacing your cutlery after every course etc. I mentioned that I was cold to my partner and next thing I knew a staff had brought me a shawl! The staff also knew all the dishes by heart and knew of our dietary restrictions (lacto vegetarian, pescatarian who doesn't eat dairy), which were super well accommodated without any eye rolls or judgement. 2. Despite probably being more known for their meat and seafood options, the vegetarian and vegan options on the tasting menu are also fantastic!!! Vegans- call Alo at least a day in advance and they will tailor your menu to suit your needs!  3. Booking through Amex will get you special perks such as champagne to start. 4. Remember that you are here for the EXPERIENCE, so slow down your bites (eat like the Europeans lol), savor each course, ask about the ingredients, look around you, enjoy your dinner company etc. The tasting menu offers very tiny portions, all intricately prepared and individualized for you, which is a food experience that you might never come across again, so cherish the time you spend here. Alo reminds us all that eating is to satisfy not just physiological needs, but also something more spiritual.  5. Every menu is unique, every day. My partner and I were both vegetarian basically, yet our vegetarian menu items differed. 6. We were here for almost 4 hours, so plan accordingly! Contrary to what you may have read in other reviews, the time between each course is not that long. Food does come fairly quickly (within 5-6 minutes between each course). 7. Yes, we were both still hungry at the end of our gastronomy journey. So smart foodies, do eat something before coming. Portions are, again, super small.  3 words to sum up tonight's experience? Meticulous, indulgent, anticipation."}
{"text":"Ate here with my wife on June 22/16, for my birthday. Reservation was made 2 months in advance & still could only get a 9:30pm seating. This place is popular! This was the best meal I have had since I had dinner at Atelier de Joel Robuchon in Paris a few years ago. Alo was perfect in almost every way. My only gripe was a large group eating in the bar had a newborn baby with them who cried the whole time we were having cocktails. This is not a restaurant for children! Other than that, nothing but praise- food, wine pairings, ambience & service were above reproach. Friendly, helpful service by all the staff, especially the sommelier, who really knew his stuff & explained each wine carefully & with great passion. The room itself is absolutely beautiful. Tasting menu of 5 courses was actually 13 courses, including amuse-bouche & 2 dessert courses. Every single course was heaven. See attached picture of our menu, including the wine pairings. The menu is presented to you in a small envelope at meal's end as a little remembrance- very nice touch! Best restaurant in Toronto, IMHO!"}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had in Toronto. Their presentation and creativity are spectacular. Great for a special occasion...if you can get reservations! Good luck!"}
{"text":"Alo exceeded my expectations for fine dining in Canada, but has some major things to work on to be world class.  First of all, I'm not a fan of the tables where you have half the group in a booth and half the people in chairs. Its not intimate and the table is too big. The overall look of the restaurant is appealing.  Picking your napkin color is cheesy but a nice touch.  Secondly, service was sterile and routine, not only the food descriptions but the boring tasting pairing as well. Our server was smarmy, not genuine and seemed put out. Frustrating.  Lastly, the length and pacing of the meal was horrendous. There were 6 dishes and 4 amuses.  The dinner was over 3 hours long. That's inexcusable.  15 minutes between courses left me bored and starving after dinner. For a restaurant open two years, no clue what Chef Kriss is doing, and he was there half the meal expediting.  Take away these things and its Michelin worthy.  The food for the most part is amazing. Chef does an amazing job with fish and balancing fresh citrusy flavors.  He also kills with the vegan tasting, which was a touch mushroom heavy but I thought was great and actually preferred to some of the regular courses. Chef also is amazing at adding texture to several dishes.    Some highlights included the bead cheese starter, the toro tartare with coconut which was perfect,  and the scallop.    The halibut was an utter joke, horrendous.  Dessert was sterile and boring need some work there.  I had a fun time. I wouldn't say this is a must visit, but its really solid."}
{"text":"I was at Alo for a belated Valentines day dinner with my wife. Yes, it took me months to finally get a seating and I had to use the help of my AMEX card concierge service for the reservation. It was definately worth the wait as this was one of the best meals I have ever had.  The food was beautiful, imaginative, inspired and innovative. The flavours and textures of the food were unique and made to perfection. You are aware of the ingredients and at times it did not make sense but it delightfully worked out. Every bite just lit up my taste buds and got their complete and undivided attention. My wife concurred.  The service was impeccable. There were no pretensions in the servers at all. They serve you with a smile, assist you, explain the food and wine to you. You can feel the attentiveness in the air at Alo. You can feel it is a serious place but only because your satisfaction is taken seriously at Alo. My wife went to the washroom and they folded her napkin and the servers always made sure our table was spotless. Someone was always available for us yet they were never intrusive whilst doing so. Alo is the epitome of fine dining in my opinion and I am glad we have them in Toronto. In my opinion it is fine dining at not fine dining prices. Our meal came to a total of just over $300 and that included a drink pairing for my wife, two drinks for me and a coffee. I am not trying to brag but I left a $100 tip because I really felt the experience was worth much more. Honestly, I would have been happy to pay more. Try your best to experience Alo, it is worth the wait and cost."}
{"text":"Alo is one of my favorite places to have dinner. Though reservations are usually a pain to obtain. The food tells a story throughout the meal, enter the restaurant hungry because by the time you leave you will be full not just with your stomach with your taste buds satisfied."}
{"text":"Likely THE toughest reservation to get in town. Just as hard to get into as EMP in NYC. But even with the difficultly we were able to get a late reso for dinner.   The decor is more art gallery chic than upscale high end restaurant and suits the neighbourhood. We were the most dressed up table in suits and lace dresses.   The service was impeccable and the wine flights matched the dishes well. There were no misses for me and overall the food matched my expectations, which were high. My friends thought the style didn't seem modern French and there were several fish components. For me the food was beautiful, the flavor elegant, and the proportions weighty enough, though I doubt anyone was stuffed.   This is the best restaurant for me so far in Toronto, though my friends preferred Richmond Station. So it will really dependent on your tastes and palate. I wouldn't definitely come back for another occasion."}
{"text":"Great food and great atmosphere. We were a party of 6 am had a great time. Food was delicious and reasonable priced. We definately recommend and we will be back."}
{"text":"I took my husband for his birthday dinner after reading all the rave reviews online. The service was excellent, there is no question about that. I'm sorry to say however, but neither of us found the food to be extraordinary. We found many of the dishes to be plain, or had a combination flavours that weren't complementary to each other. I'm by no means a food connoisseur, my husband and I just eat out a lot and we love good food. And the food was okay, but I don't think here was anything in particularly special or memorable about it. I think for $95 per person, it's actually on the cheaper end for what you get but don't be jaded by the hype and reviews about the food... it's good, but not great. Sorry."}
{"text":"Over the top!!! Amazing service that I have never experienced anywhere else. From the presentation of the food, knowledgeable and explanation of the food items to the attention to detail- this is a 10 out of 5 place. I got a reservation through a friend after waiting for months and it was worth every penny. The wine pairings with the courses was a must-do! My favorite part was the menu sealed as a takeaway souvenir. Classy doesn't even describe it well. Not surprised that this has been Canada's top restaurant. Bravo team Alo!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal experience. Worth every dollar. If I could go here for every special occasion..."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for my birthday dinner. I mentioned that I would love to try this restaurant as we are into fine dining, and since trying 3 Michelin Star restaurants, we are always looking for a place comparable in Toronto.  The Dining Room is small therefore reservations are a bit harder to get. My boyfriend had to reserve 2 months in advance.  It is locate in Queen and Spadina,  there was no visible sign therefore pay attention to the address.  Upon entering,  a hostess greeted us and sent us to the elevator on the 5th floor.  The hostess greeted us upstairs as well an confirmed our reservation.  Both were very friendly and pleasant. We waited in the bar/lounge area which was beautiful.  The wall of alcohol bottles was very nice.  It seemed they have every alcohol which could make a lot of delicious Food. If you cannot get a reservation,  you may also eat in the lounge.. they serve bar food and the menu still looks delirious.  Sadly, because I am pregnant, I was unable to enjoy any of their house made cocktails, but I heard only good things.  We were finally escorted to our table, and we pass by the open kitchen. You are able to sit by the bar tables facing the kitchen however I believe that would be the 10 course Chef tasting which I would love to try next time.  The menu consisted of 4 courses at $95 each person and an additional $65 should you choose to have wine pairings with your meal. They were aware that we were celebrating a birthday so they provided me the menu that said Happy Birthday! I love the small gestures.  They are also very accommodating as I am unable to eat anything raw which they had on the menu .. they provided me with options. I enjoyed the little things they sent in between courses especially their house made bread.   Food was great. Worth the price and the service is excellent. I cannot wait to return post baby"}
{"text":"Tucked away in the corner of Queen and Spadina is this fantastic restaurant and is a true hidden gem of Toronto. It was an odd path to get to the restaurant and the elevator ride was unique experience but it felt like being a kid again. Going to your own private club house that only a few know about!  Once you arrive to the restaurant the view of Spadina lit up at night is quite a sight to see. Most of us are too busy going from one place to another to see the real beauty of the Toronto. Alo restaurant has successfully been able to capture this experience for us. Its a quiet low key place, perfect for unwinding after a long day with a delicious cocktail. It is an upscale feel but the ambiance is relaxed and not pretentious at all similar to a Hong Kong bar scene.  They have an extensive cocktail list that were handcrafted by the bartenders and were delicious! The Windmill is my favorite so far, a cocktail made with Gin and foamy egg whites and crushed coriander seeds is a refreshing drink and is a foodie's dream cocktail! Waiting for the drinks is the best part watching the bartenders make these cocktails for you is quite a sight to see.   Their dedication into their craft and skill is one of if not the best in Toronto has to offer. It was like watching a conductor lead an orchestra! Needless to say, I have now found my Toronto Bar, and once you go here you will as well!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is fantastic overall!   I have been looking for the restaurant like this in Toronto...finally found one! The only thing is that we had to wait a couple months to finally visit this restaurant after making a reservation.   The service is great and the food is excellent with creativity that you don't see much in Toronto.   I would love to visit again sometimes in the spring, summer and fall when the menu changes?"}
{"text":"This is the only time I have given a 5 star to a restaurant for this level. Reservations were a definite pain in the ass because they fill up so fast and time slots are sparse. You must book in advance or use their waiting list and be at the mercy of Lady Luck.  We were coming here for my SO's bday celebration and it was impeccable service from start to finish. As we were in the dining room, we had to do the tasting menu. The savoury courses were all amazing and delicately prepared. The dishes were all prepared with visual presentation and balance in mind. If there was a defect, the dessert wasnt as varied and too similar.  The service was the best I ever had. The moment my water was almost done, it would be filled. If i needed to go to the washroom, they also folded my napkin and were there to get my chair when i was back. When they took our coats, it was already ready for us to pick up on the way out.  Great food, great atmosphere and amazing service."}
{"text":"Probably one of the better restaurants in Toronto. I'd move it into my top 2 along with Veloute and move Momofuku to #3 after the last time I went. You'll need to make a reservation well in advance. Try to sit at the kitchen table which is kind of a bar overlooking the kitchen because those seats forces you to have something like a 16 course tasting menu instead of a 12 or 13 course tasting menu if you sit at the table. You also get to see how the chef's make the food and hear how the kitchen works. There are technically 6 seats. However, every Saturday, there is always the same heavier set Indian guy who is always eating there by himself so there's really only 5 seats available. And this is EVERY Saturday. We came here for my dad's birthday so my sister made a reservation well in advance.  The entrance to the restaurant is super super hard to find as there isn't really any signs outside. Just a single, un-decorated glass door so you kind of need to know what you're looking for. However, if you do find it, once you get past this door, there is a darker hallway with a hostess at the other end who will direct you to an elevator to the 3rd floor. Once you get up there, there's another hostess who will take you to your seats. The first room is their main bar with an a la carte menu option. If you can't get a table, then you can eat in the bar area. The food there looked pretty good as the chefs were cooking it but the main star is the 16 course tasting menu.  The food itself was very good. I wouldn't say Michelin star quality yet but close. The service was good as well, still not Michelin star quality but close. The waiter messed up our order of wine and the 'sommelier' had to go back to their storage to get the correct bottle. I think the storage is on the 2nd floor as she was gone a lot longer that I thought. The only thing that I didn't like was that when they served the fish, they gave it to us with the skin on. However, they didn't completely remove all the scales on the fish skin which is a big no-no if you're going to serve a piece of fish with the skin on. I pulled 2 scales out of my mouth and my dad had one as well. He also had a sizable piece of bone in his filet which should have been removed. However, this would be my only gripe. There were plenty of desserts and they even did something special for my dad with a nice happy birthday message on the plate for him which was greatly appreciated. The price-wise, this is one of the more expensive restaurants in Toronto so be prepared to drop a pretty penny. Especially if you're going to do the wine-pairing option.  That being said, I can definitely see myself coming back."}
{"text":"Alo was rated the top restaurant in Toronto and I can see why.  First it's small and for dinner they only have 2 seating times (6:30 and 8:45pm if I remember correctly).  You can go to the bar area in the front, there are a few tables and you can enjoy a drink or two with a few bites as a walk-in.  Reservations are a must for dinner.  Being on the smaller side you get that intimate feel.  The kitchen is a bit open so you can see (depending on where you are sitting) all the action.  It's a price fix menu - &105pp.  It's about 8 or so courses with 3 dessert courses.  You do get some options in the menu.  Also you can email them any allergies and/or dietary restrictions and they will gladly accommodate!  It's a tasting menu so each course it small, but small things lead up to a full tummy (for me anyways)  They change up their menu every 6-8 weeks trying use as many in season items as possible.  When presented the bill you also get a copy of the menu (smart marketing move).  While I've honestly had better food elsewhere (don't get me wrong it's pretty good here) the service is the absolute best you will find anywhere.  The attention to detail, when you get up they come by and re-fold your napkin, how they place the food on the table, the explanations about each dish...wow.  You feel like a King or Queen here!   I'm glad I had the opportunity to try it - definitely an experience"}
{"text":"After trying alo; I can not remember who was my number one restaurant. Yes it is that good"}
{"text":"I think this is the only time I've given any place 5 stars. I was so excited to give Canada's #1 restaurant a try after reserving it 2 months in advance!  The restaurant is small but beautifully decorated. Loved the colours and the booths were really comfortable to sit in.   The best part is the service. The servers were so attentive and I didn't need to tell them to get anything and they were already at it! Whether it be filling up my water or taking the plates away, they were so efficient and attentive.   The servers memorized each dish and its ingredients to ensure we knew what we were eating. The food is really creative and some of the different things I tasted were unique! Such as cucumber puree as a pre dessert.   Definitely think it's worth the value and lives up to the hype!! Would want to be back to try their menu again since the server said the menu changes approx every 8-9 weeks."}
{"text":"We had an excellent experience dining at Alo Restaurant.  My boyfriend told me the reservations he booked was two months in advance.. so book early! The atmosphere is modern - \"Nouveau French\". I liked how spacious the restaurant was. The tables weren't packed together so there is more privacy during our dining session. Service was absolutely amazing - we were attended in good intervals. The servers knew the menu by heart! They also changed the utensils for every dish that we had :D  DRINKS:  [to start off] * cocktail bouteille pour deux * reds  TASTING MENU  * AMUSE-BOUCHE (cheese puffs & mini foie gras cakes) (4/5) This dish was a set of cheese puffs and foie gras cakes on a cute plating display. This was a great start to our tasting menu! The cheese puffs were still warm and the foie gras paste was perfection.  * VENETIAN CAVIAR, POTATO (5/5) The foamy and creamy potato purée was a great pairing with the caviar. The potato taste was very light and contrasted the caviar's flavour very well. A light dish to start off.  * STRIPED BASS, CUCUMBER, HONEYDEW MELON, RICE (5/5) This was one of my favourite dishes of the night. The striped bass was served as a sashimi, it was fresh, sweet and delicious. Each of the sides were marinated differently. A cute and unique display.  * PAIN AU LAIT (4/5) My boyfriend loved this! This was sourdough bread with salt sprinkled on the top. We were generous with the butter that came with it, as the server advised.. It was soo good haha  * ANTEBELLUM GRITS, DUNGENESS CRAB, CORN, NORI (5/5) Loved this! There was a strong taste of nori (seaweed) and sweet corn. The crab meats were in big chunks. The portion may look small, but it fills you up quickly.  * QUEBEC FOIE GRAS, SUNCHOKES, HIMROD GRAPES, VER JUS (4/5) The foie gras chunks were delicious. I do like the sauce, but I don't love it haha. I felt like it overtook the foie gras a bit.. but yummy nonetheless.  * NOVA SCOTIA LOBSTER, CHESTNUT, SALSIFY, BRUSSEL SPROUTS (5/5) I'd revisit Alo Restaurant for this dish alone. This was deeeelicious!! The lobster was poached to perfection. The sides were fresh and its flavours were distinct from the lobster itself.  * PACIFIC HALIBUT, CHERRY TOMATOES, SAMPHIRE, SHELLFISH EMULSION (3/5) Compared to the lobster, this was definitely not as good. The halibut was fresh but was a bit dry. We felt like we needed to dip the fish in its sauce in order to enjoy this dish more.  * RACK OF PORK, PEACHES, PEPPERS, PISTACHIO (4/5) We usually eat these rack of pork at Chinese restaurant so we were curious to see how Alo would cook them. It was great! The pork meat was juicy and went pleasantly well with the peaches and pistachio. Big points goes out to the pistachios!  * BEEF RIBEYE, MATSUTAKE MUSHROOMS, SPINACH, BERNAISE (4/5) We felt like the vegetables that paired the ribeye overtook the main itself! The mushrooms and spinach were so good - all marinated with different sauces. The ribeye itself was good, but did not wow us as much as the sides.  * AMUSE-BOUCHE (popcorn ice cream with popcorn bits) (5/5) I was sold the moment our server told us the amuse-bouche was popcorn ice cream!! It was light and had a great texture. Yummy yummy.  * HONEY CRISP APPLE, PUFF PASTRY, CALVADOS (5/5) Loveeed this! It combines both the sourness and sweetness of apples in one dessert. The crispy cookie also stood out to us in this dessert.  * LAST OF THE SEASON BERRIES, ALMOND, FENNEL (4/5) A colourful and cute display. A variety of mixed berries were part of this dessert. I'm not a big fan of raspberries but it was still pretty good :)   * DARK CHOCOLATE, MINT (5/5) This was aaamazing! Note that I don't even like mint ice cream haha! The dark chocolate was a bit bitter. They've included milk chocolate in the mix, along with the mint chocolate, which balanced the flavours well.  To end off your tasting menu experience for the night, they give you an envelope with the list of the dishes and wine pairings. I thought this was a cute personal touch :) I'd definitely revisit when they change up the tasting menu later on :D"}
{"text":"This is not just the best new restaurant in Toronto. This is THE best restaurant in Toronto. Chef Patrick Kriss has created something very special with Alo. It's a beautiful, modern, metropolitan space, a 3rd floor hidden gem with a gorgeous floating bar and washrooms hidden behind a sliding panel - this an undeniably sleek city restaurant. And yet there is no attitude, it's completely comfortable and unpretentious. I love that the dining room offers plenty of space between tables, and the service here is perfect - seamless, elegant, unobtrusive.   A few words about the food: After eating here, the details seem unimportant. I can tell you that the ingredients were spectacular, the preparation perfectly on point, that even the cocktails and desserts (so often lacking in TO restaurants) are incredible, innovative, and sumptuous. I can tell you that the pacing of our 2.5 hour dinner was exactly right, every dish a work of art, better than the last, full of surprises and delightful pleasures. I can tell you that Alo's $89 pre fixe is a ridiculous deal, a steal really, for what you get. But I think overall, it's the feeling that I want to share here. This food made me smile. This food made me giggle. This food made a woman across the dining room loudly exclaim \"OH MY GAAWWWDDD!!!\" in the middle of her dinner, to which we all looked over and nodded and smiled. She embarrassingly tried to apologize, but there was no need - all of us in that dining room were genuinely ohh myyyyy gggaawwwddding along with her as we cleaned our plates. We were all there for this experience together. We understood exactly.  As we were exiting the dining room, Patrick Kriss came forward to extend a hand and ask if we enjoyed our meals. I hugged him. Alo is that good. Go NOW."}
{"text":"Lady took me here on my birthday! The service is amazing. The complementary bread is amazing. Tastes so buttery and melts in your mouth. I think there's too many spoilers already.  If you get the chance to enjoy Alo, the 5 course (10 total different courses between 2 people), it's filling, I doubt we could handle more than that.   Come for the bread. It's worth the price of admission. Everything else is a bonus. A delicious bonus."}
{"text":"The hardest table to get a seat at is Alo. Food critics let the cat out of the bag day one, and Alo is booked out solid two months in advance. I made 3 reservations all at the same time, and just came away from the first of them. Yes, it's everything the critics are raving about, and then some. Food: sophisticated, stunning taste surprises, award-winning plating. Service: second to none. Canoe has the finest service and friendliest staff in all of Toronto, and Alo is their twin equal. Every encounter with their welcoming team is a delight.  Ambience: from their Zen understated sign, to the Schott Zwiesel Crystal tumblers, to the stone and wood restrooms concealed behind discreet sliding panel revealing an inner sanctum, the place whispers understated refined elegance.  My birthday guest was delighted with the surprise chocolate cake adorned by a candle and embossed Happy Birthday in chocolate on the white china.  Alo, you've created a sanctuary to fine dining. Kudos and warmest wishes for a long magnificent reign as the pinnacle of Toronto restaurants!  davidintoronto"}
{"text":"Easily one of the best dining experiences I have ever had. The space is interesting, and the service is top notch. The food is amazing and you pay for 5 courses but you end up getting like 9 when you factor in all the extras. It's a long experience, but totally worth it and I will definitely come back. I appreciate their accommodation as well, we asked for a non-seafood menu and they were happy to accommodate. No wonder you can't get a reservation here until the new year!"}
{"text":"Alo tasting menu - $115 as of November 2017.  I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at Alo. Upon stepping out of the elevator onto the 3rd floor, I immediately felt like I had stepped into another world. Part uneasy, part excited. There is the bar on one side, a very dark space, followed by the kitchen and the dining area - small and intimate. Service was excellent. The room was quite cold near the end. Be prepared for a 3 hour meal - the dishes come out fairly slowly.  Food-wise, there were some hits and misses, depending on personal preference.   My favorites were:  - Canapes - foie gras cubes (one with some puffed rice, one with caramel) and gougères - a pastry cheese ball - Amuse Bouche - venison tartare  - Oyster on potato puree - I loved the creamy potato puree but the oyster was fishy - Homemade pasta with fontina cheese, chestnut, squash  - Hokkaido scallop - can see the technique from the thinly sliced green tomatoes and grapes on top  Not a fan of the mains: - Pork belly - wasn't particularly soft, didn't like the pairing with coriander sauce - Rib eye - parts were overcooked and not a fan of the sweet sauce  There was a pre-dessert (lemon and cucumber puree sorbet - very refreshing), and 2 desserts - an apple based and a white chocolate based. Both were similar in that they included some sort of icecream/cream, meringue/chocolate and had a modern presentation.   Recommended for a fine-dining experience for date-night/special occasion!"}
{"text":"Alo is reputed to be one of the top restaurants in Toronto (even all of Canada) and it's super difficult to get a reservation for their tasting menu. It requires camping in front of a computer each month. Luckily they have a bar area that is walk in only, and serves select dishes from their regular menu. The bar area is quite cute as well!  Another option is Aloette downstairs, which is more like a relaxed bistro/diner vibe.   I went to Alo's bar area to try out their food and drinks. Their cocktail menu is quite detailed and expansive, so we just asked the bartender for some recommendations. The service is excellent! The servers are very friendly and knowledgeable. Their recommendations are super honest, and made sure to keep us reminded of the kitchen close time so we could place our orders on time.   We tried scallop and tamachi(yellow fin) as appetizers. Both are very light and refreshing. These are definitely the highlights of the meal!  For main, we had the salmon and fried cauliflower. The salmon was just the right amount of raw for us to taste the fat.  Dessert was cheesecake, and Chateau de Bourgogne (sweet cheese) and grilled sourdough bread. Both are quite interesting!   I totally loved the place and will definitely try to get reservation for their tasting menu next time!"}
{"text":"Finding the words to write this review has been so hard--Everything I want to say sounds incredibly cheesy and #cringe but this restaurant is a real  gem and deserves allllll the superlatives. Alo, you are the best of Toronto!   Now on to the food: I concur with many other reviewers that the seasoning here is more on the aggressive side. There were a few dishes that I thought were too heavily seasoned--while it was not quite salty enough to be off-putting, it was definitely noticeable. That being said, everything else was near perfect. The veal was outrageously tasty, the scallops were mind-numbingly delicious, and that toro tartare? Amazing! I love that they change up their menus and I'm definitely planning on coming back the next time I am able to get a reservation. (This is a mission in and of itself, mind you.)   After tax and tip, the bill came to $160 for dinner and a drink for one. In speaking with my friends who came with me, I think it's important to note that Alo isn't for everyone. While the food here is superb, I do think that the cost also speaks for itself. Some of us thought it was worth the price (me!!!) but others thought it wasn't. Speaking as an economist, I do think you'd have to be relatively price insensitive to enjoy dinner here. In other words, if you're a huge foodie who spends 100% of your pay check on food anyways (me!!!), why not give up a month (or two) of Starbucks runs and eat at the best restaurant in Canada?   TLDR: COME HERE ASAP!"}
{"text":"Words cannot express how delectably divine a dinner at Alo is. It is no surprise this is the number one restaurant in Canada and Toronto. If you're lucky to score a reservation at this gem of a restaurant, you're guaranteed to be amazed. Master Chef Patrick's creations are works of art that tantalize your sense of sight and smell. Each course boasts a masterful balance of taste and textures that will have your tastebuds dance with orgasmic delight. Christopher, the ever-charming sommelier, will guide you through your wine selection. Your evening will unfold like a great performance where your enjoyment takes centre stage, and every detail has been carefully crafted by the best team. The menu changes every season, making the most of the freshest and best ingredients. With each visit, you'll be yearning to do it all over again."}
{"text":"Wow!   I booked our table for 24th Feb 2017 on 25th Dec 2017. Yes! that's right you have to wait 2 months to dine here. They are always fully booked. It's really difficult to get a reservation here. I booked at midnight right when they opened reservations for the day. It was a surprise dinner that I booked for husband's birthday. He is a sous chef in a starwood hotel. It's really difficult for a restaurant to impress him and let me tell you Alo was successful in doing so.  I don't have words to describe the experience we had at the restaurant. Everything from service to ambience and food was perfect. Though the portion size are small at the end of your courses you feel soooo FULL. Each course was really tasty and full of flavours. Definitely definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"It's a beautiful restaurant but overpriced. The spinach stuffed chicken was delicious and it's a must have! I love the texture of this dish from the baked chicken with a bit of crisp skin, flavourful little bites of round pasta and bacon combined with This beautiful purée that just dances in your mouth. The duck pizza with potatoes mediocre - there any many places with better stone oven baked pizza in the city nowadays. The grilled octopus was slightly over cooked unfortunately."}
{"text":"We were incredibly lucky that our journey to try this restaurant was not preceded by months of end of trying to call and book a reservation at the restaurant! Our meal at Alo was actually a very lovely wedding gift that we received almost 2 years ago and we just finally had time to get around to finally using the gift certificate!  Because our meal is essentially already paid for, we were able to reserve well ahead of time and Becky at Alo had been more than accomodating to us since we had to change the date twice before we finally were able to go for sure!  We ended up eating at 5:30pm and we ran a bit late because of traffic, but Alo was very nice about it - we called and told them we were running late. It's right at the corner of Spadina and Queen - it's not super obvious and you have to look a bit to find the entrance.  The restaurant was beautiful inside - nicely decorated with a modern French flair. I opted to have a wine pairing along with the dishes - hubby was driving so he just had one of their mocktails instead.   Judging by the pictures you can tell that each dish is beautifully crafted and presented. They accomodated for my lactose intolerance and certain dishes they made something slightly different for me while my hubby had the regular course. The wine connoisseur was very nice and explained each of the wine's background for each course. Service was excellent! We didn't feel suffocated by waiters watching our every move lol, but they did pay quick attention - e.g. if i wanted to go to the bathroom someone took me there and moved the table a bit for me to get out.  So the first two courses were sashimi and both very different, but the various garnishes and sauces that came with it were delightful! Next was the corn and egg yolk soup - rich, packed with flavour and yet delicate!   Following that, I had carolina rice with corel mushrooms and foam while my hubby had stuffed tortellini - both were excellent. Particularly the mushroom dish - i LOVE mushrooms, and the broth in the dish had so much flavour packed in that every bite was like heaven!  Next on the menu were our mains. First we had pork belly. I loved the fried brussel sprout leaves that came with the dish. Belly was crispy skin but soft and delicious in the meat. The sauces paired wonderfully with the pork. Following that, we had baby lettuce with veal chop. Meat was cooked to perfect medium rare and it's simple in that they didn't play too much with the veal itself - just some salt and pepper - but it's the accompanying sauces on the plate, mixed together with the veal and some of the lettuce, was unbelievable!  Then my hubby had lemon ice-cream and i had cucumber sorbet to cleanse our palates before going onto the dessert course. By now i had gone through various white wines and finished off with a medium body red with the veal.   Both desserts we had were great! the first one I got was a flourless chocolate cake with a vanilla \"ice-cream\" and the second one was a bit more tart with grapefruit. Both were amazing and delicious and i was surpisingly full at that point already!   At the end of the meal they printed our menu and put them in little envelopes :) Fantastic meal all in all and I can see why this French restaurant has become the top one in this country! Definitely worth a try and I would love to go back again sometime in the future!  If you can't get in on this place, there is an alternative - downstairs they have Aloette - you can see my other review on that restaurant, but you will get a glimpse of what Alo has to offer by trying Aloette :)"}
{"text":"Review based on visit from July 28, 2017 at 5:30pm  Having trouble making an RSVP on Opentable because it is such a stupid gimmick?   Let me tell you how to book:   If today's date is July 29, then you can only receive slots up until September 27 (only allowed to book 60 days in advance). Stake out the site; as soon as 12am strikes, refresh your browser and you shall see new time slots. Make sure you decide on a time first i.e. 6pm & have your credit card ready--they go like hotcakes. Think of it as bidding.   Service: Exemplary!  Choice of complimentary distilled or sparkling water offered and even a choice in the colour of your napkin; white or light blue. Server was always there ready and waiting to fill our glasses; never had to ask for anything. They even made an effort to pull out your chair to sit down; so charming.  The tasting menu we opted for costed $105 per person (no wine pairing which would had been an additional $75)--I was happy they were able to accommodate my pescatarian diet and emailed me to ensure they've covered all my dietary restrictions.  Each plate of food was presented in a beautiful and exquisite way.  ====Menu====  [Very good] Hamachi Canapé: Bite-sized which clean and natural flavours  [Ok] Sturgeon Caviar Puff: It was tasty, but the puff was an empty shell of air.   [Good] Foie Gras Champagne Jelly: Light champagne flavours and nutty foie gras flavour combined.   [Meh] Brown butter radish: Bland and less impressive than other items. That being said, it still doesn't take away from the experience.  [REALLY GOOD] Truffle Gougère: At least we think it was truffle...not sure since it wasn't on our menu list. But wowzers!! It was so tasty. At first bite, the filling was warm and just oozes into your mouth. Loved it!  [Ok] Toro, Coconut Chili: The cool coconut was refreshing with the toro. Taste was a bit bland, but the natural flavours were really noticeable.   [Good] Baby White Shrimp, Sturgeon Caviar, Cherry Tomatoes: Came out in a dainty bowl with an exquisite spoon made of shell. Again, all natural flavours from each seafood melded with the tomatoes. Tasty indeed.  [SOOO GOOD] Hokkaido Sea Urchin, Corn, Yellow Plum: This was soooo good! The chilled corn purée on top complemented the sea urchin so well.   [LIKE FALLING IN LOVE] Medai, Sudachi, Myoga, Ice Plants: No salt on the Medai fish aka Bluenose Sea Bass so you can savour it in its freshest form along with citric notes of sudachi  on your tastebuds. Didn't find that the ice plants nor the black crunchy herbs had any flavour, but it gave the dish some nice texture  [Too salty] Pain au lait topped with a bit of seasalt and house-made churned butter: Bun was too buttery and even saltier eaten with the chanterelles potato.  [Good] Agnolotti, Beaufort Cheese, Australian Black Truffle & Brown Butter Sauce: Delicious with cheese oozing out at each bite from the agnolotti. Not sure why, but really couldn't taste the truffle even though it was on top. The addition of croutons gave it some nice texture.  [THE BEST!] King Ora Salmon, Buttermilk, Meyer Kosho, Cincinatti Radish: Best dish of the evening! Salmon poached just right. Flesh was cooked just right  [Delicious meat option] Steak, Shitake Mushrooms, Umeboshi, Ponzu Jus: Steak was about 36mm in size. Friend described it as tender & not over-seasoned.   [Pretty good] Ocean Trout, Shitake Mushrooms, Umeboshi, Ponzu: Crispy pan-fried trout in a bed of delicious buttery sauce. Flesh peeled off and cooked just right.  [Ok] Cucumber Champagne de Juniper (Pre-dessert): Never heard of pre-dessert in my life, but it was the size of a chinese ceramic spoon and very refreshing. Can be consumed in 1 bite.  [Meh] Strawberry, Chamomile, Orange Blossom: It was good where the whipped cream and cake was not overly sweet. The red strawberry decorations were just ok--nothing too special.  [Ok] Toasted Cocoa, Hazelnuts & icecream: Nothing much to say other than it was good, and the icecream was extra creamy.  ====  Note that the card terminals does not allow you to calculate tip before tax which is quite perplexing because it means you are being taxed for your tip. Paid around $140/person for the whole meal without alcohol which is very expensive but you get the quality you pay for.  I've tried it once--liked it, but probably wouldn't come back again anytime soon."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! We were blown away by the food and service. We had the extended tasting menu with wine pairing. Each dish was plated with care - the attention to detail was strong. When we ordered tea at the end, they gave us a sand timer so we can steep our tea for the perfect amount of time. The value cannot be beat... ~$195 for tasting and wine pairing (equivalent to 4 glasses of wine!). Why wonder this place is fully booked 60 days in advance. If you want to come here for a bday, book WAY ahead. They gave my bf a little chocolate cake dessert with a candle for his bday."}
{"text":"Mind officially blown.  This is undoubtably the best meal and dining experience I have ever had in Canada and possibly globally.    There is so much to say and so few new ways to say them given all the other reviews.  Believe them.  Go.  Go now, or I guess, in two months when you can get a reservation.    I will write more later but I just wanted to record this  as a massive thank you to the entire staff that works there.   Exceptional on every level"}
{"text":"Took my Miami team out there for a 9pm late bite. We sat at a table by the bar.  Everything was delicious. The cocktails are not sweet so we loved it. Bartender was great when one of my guest did not know what he wants to drink and just gave him a few preferred flavours and he ended up loving the custom cocktail. Ceviche, beef, everything was delicious. Pork belly was a bit over-cooked and my guest needed toothpicks but for whatever reason we didn't even ask for it and that annoyed him a bit. Finished off with a tea and we were happy the tea box came with its own lights so it was easy to read all the labels in the bar setting. Great mix of patrons that night. Mostly guys upstairs at the bar on a Tuesday night. Hey this girl can't complain about that."}
{"text":"The service is better than the food, and they do take customer service as serious as their food. Lovely restaurant with high-end service and presentation. Fantastic dining experience with delicious and creative dishes."}
{"text":"A group of us checked out the tasting menu. 11 courses in total, including 8 mains, pre-dessert, and two main desserts. Personal favourite part is the dessert, but each main course has its own flavour, very exotic. The service is simply amazing. The whole experience definitely worth the two month wait, and the $$$ ;)"}
{"text":"Very original gastronomic delight...staff is knowledgeable and not pretentious...This is hands down the best restaurant in Toronto....cool and innovative space....hard to get a reservation but not impossible and definitely worth the wait..."}
{"text":"It is nice to see that excellent service is finally starting to make its way back into fine dining. From the moment you arrive you are taken into an oasis that you never knew existed at Queen & Spadina. We had the daily tasting menu with wine pairings and it was both the perfect amount of food, it was also the perfect amount of wine.  It is near impossible to get a reservation here as I had to wait around 2 months for mine but when we were there we were told you can show up to the bar area and eat there without a reservation also.   Each of the courses was carefully prepared and presented and it was definitely a memorable evening and likely the best dining experience I've had in Toronto.  The price tag for dinner with the wine parings and a few beers to start came in at around $450-$500 including tax and tip making this a special occasions only type place, unless you are balling out of control.   If you can get in, give Alo a try!"}
{"text":"Alo was amazing!!!! I cannot express enough how phenomenal this place is. My wife and I took a trip to Toronto back in October. We were looking for a nice restaurant to check out, and being unfamiliar with the area, we took to Google, opentable, and yelp to research restaurants. We stumbled upon Alo, which didn't have a ton of reviews, but every review it had was extremely positive. So, we booked a reservation and figured we'd give it a shot. We were a little concerned at first when we arrived and realized it was a tasting menu. We actually began discussing where we'd be going afterwards for burgers or something because we didn't think the small plates would fill us up. Wow, were we wrong. Every single dish was better than the one before it. And even though they were small plates, they were pretty ample. By the end of the tasting, we barely had enough room for dessert....but, the dinner was so amazingly out of this world, we had to get the dessert also. On top of that, we also did the wine pairing, which was fantastic and spot on. The bill wasn't cheap. But, we had so much food and drinks, and everything was so delicious and awesome, that it was worth every penny. The service was as unparalleled as the food. Everyone that came over to our table was very friendly and knowledgeable about the various plates and wines. I can't wait to take a trip back to Toronto, solely because I can't wait to go back to Alo (and because Toronto was an awesome city, but Alo really made a great impression)"}
{"text":"After a strong recommendation over the holidays, we began our process in trying to get reservations.  The first day I tried in the evening, and did not find any resos on Open Table, however the next morning I was able to make a reservation for 2 on a Tuesday at 10 pm 2 months down the road.  Before your dinner service, alo will contact you via phone or e-mail to remind you of your reso and to ask if you have any allergies or dietary restrictions.  Located on the third floor in the building on the south east corner of Spadina and Queen, making it a unique location, away from other higher end restaurants.   Our journey began in an elevator, which really added to the mystery of our reservation.   The staff were very friendly, and the service was impeccable.    We opted for the tasting menu, with one drink each.  My boyfriend and I are the types to want to try everything, and our server recommended that we choose different dishes between the two of us.  This was probably the best advice ever, because we were able to try everything on the tasting menu that night.  Usually we like to deduce how the food was cooked and the technique used, but we were stumped with some of the plates.  The meal was absolutely delicious and filling.  I thought we were finished, until our server told us there was still coffee cake to be served.  I did find some of the dishes a bit salty, but because they were small dishes it was not a big deal.    Before we went, we saw that many Yelp reviewers post pictures of their pain au lait.  We found this kinda funny because there were more photos of the bread compared to any of the dishes.  Let me tell you, the bread was so soft, and dipping it in the chicken jus made it even better!    Between the two of us, it was about $310 with drinks and tip.  The experience, food, and especially the bread was worth the experience and lived up to its hype!"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant impeccable service! Highly recommend this restaurant for the real 5 star experience! When we entered the building it seemed like we were in some third world country and the elevator felt like it was ready to break with us inside. Once the doors opened however we were stunned by the gorgeous ambiance! We had our coats checked and our table was not ready so we were seated at the bar. The bartender was very friendly and we had some great conversation. We were then led into the open concept dining area. We could see the chefs creating the meals with intricacy and determination. The passion for making food was very transparent. We ordered from the tasting menu and each dish was delectable. The staff really made sure we were well catered to and the service was one of the very best in Toronto, I cannot stress that enough. When we were leaving our coats were ready for us at the exact moment we stepped out. Fantastic food and fantastic service!"}
{"text":"I usually don't get too deep on much past the quality of the food. This restaurant shattered all expectations and standards. I can't remember having a better meal in my lifetime. For some reason the food quality reminded me of my time in Switzerland , everyone who works here was amazing..... the detail and attention to process , ingredients , delivery was Amazing.   I'm not from Toronto but would recommend if you have one meal this is it.....and make your reservations far in advance.  Go for your anniversary, go because you love food, go because the owners and employees are amazing and love what they do.  Thank You for this amazing experience!"}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Toronto so far, very well thought out and executed food.  Can't go wrong with the chef's table or regular menu here."}
{"text":"After hearing all about Alo and how impossible it was to get a reservation there, we were lucky enough to get a last minute spot through the DINR app.    Alo did truly live up to its hype as many reviewers have already said here. When you arrived, they first took you to the bar for some drinks and led you after a while to their dining room.    There are two kinds of menus - the Chef's Table (which is extremely hard to get into) and the dining area (which is also hard to get into).  Alo features a prix fixe 8 course meal (with an extra course at the Chef's Table) and the menus change completely every season.  They do change 1-2 items weekly.    Everything we tasted danced in our mouths with bursting flavours and we were in heaven the few hours we were in there.  It is a slow meal so definitely be prepared to be there for a couple hours.    Reservations open 2 months in advance on the first Tuesday of every other month.  They just finished the May June ones but will likely open again in July for July/August reservations.  Go go go!  Seize the day and have this meal.  Updated: May 18, 2018 visit:  The food was just as fantastic this time and our service was good up until the very end when my server emphasized to me that I had put a deposit on and that my total had deducted the deposit and therefore, I would have to adjust my tip accordingly and that there's a guideline there.    Ok Captain Obvious.  Thanks.    Was it because I'm young or Asian or female that you felt compelled to point that out?  In any case, that was a bit rude to assume that I would not have tipped accordingly otherwise.  I was definitely going to do my usual 20% tipping but because he pointed that out and it irked me completely the wrong way, I gave him less.    To that server out there, I'm coming back in June.  Please don't do that again.  It was uncalled for and plain rude."}
{"text":"It's not an expensive restaurant, it's a cheap plane ticket.  You're whisked away to the land of stars and sophistication.   Just awesome.  Sure, I'd heard the hype around this restaurant.    About the world-class preparations, beautiful decor and warm attentive service.    About how it takes months to get a reservation.   But to be honest, the hype actually wasn't enough.    Toronto has never had a restaurant of this style and sophistication.   Not even close.  It's very much the kind of thing that you experience at higher end restaurants in Paris, Chicago or New York.   A completely flawless, almost effortless experience.  Perfect in every way.     The devil is in the details.   From the matching brown shoes on all the serving staff, to the way that the staff walk you to the hidden washrooms instead of merely pointing the way.     At first I thought that having your choice in napkin style was just to mask some detriment or oversight, but I ended up being wrong.   It was just a part of the fantastic culinary theatrics.  Every single movement appears to be choreographed to precision.     But not in a stuffy or silly way.    It's comfortable.   It's classy.   It's human.     How do they keep this up?  No pressure, right?       It takes a phenomenal amount of work on many levels to get all of this so right.   Much respect has to go to the front-of-house, who exist really on the same level as the superb kitchen.  Perhaps the best part of our evening circled around our repeated conversations with the sommelier, Christopher.  It truly wowed me how he was able to provide outstanding guidance that led us in some truly interesting directions without making us feel stupid or out-of-place whatsoever.     Wines were expertly paired and eloquently explained.   It's probably a good thing that it's so difficult to book a table.    Otherwise I'd have no reservations wanting to go here for every night out.     Spectacular."}
{"text":"This is rated the #1 restaurant in Canada. I am not sure why. First off, our bill came out to over $500 for 2 people. When you pay that kind of money for a meal, you expect to be blown away. I was not. Food is good, the bread is exceptional. The first course was amazing. Some of the desserts were really good, but I've had better meals elsewhere. I do agree that the service was impeccable, and very attentive. We sat overlooking the kitchen, and I could see the amount of painstaking detail that goes into each plate. They even wipe down the dishes, the kitchen is immaculate. The restaurant itself is nice looking, but wasn't blown away by the design. I guess I had high expectations given its rating, and was slightly let down. I think Canoe was better- for the food and you are made to feel like a celebrity. Frank's Kitchen in Toronto was also better. Overall, It is good, but is not a mind blowing experience."}
{"text":"Came here on Saturday for my birthday. Instantly, I was blown away by the attention to detail and impeccable service. I've never had a similar dining experience as comparable to this one. At 180 a person, it was well worth it. Everything tastes amazing, different and paired well together. My boyfriend said the asparagus dish was \"life changing\". Will definitely come back if I'm lucky enough to get a reservation as their menu changes frequently"}
{"text":"The accolades are warranted. Portions are a little small (I was hungry when I left but maybe it was all I needed) but everything is executed perfectly. The dishes are very creative and involve a lot of technique, nothing seems simple, but nothing is over the top. Great flavours and textures throughout the meal. Another must in Toronto."}
{"text":"Extremely small bite restaurant. Didn't find their dishes that creative.  The featured beef dish wasn't cooked as ordered. Service was slightly inexperienced, especially the wine service. The red wine ordered was served too warm. Ambiance was uninspiring and please note the restaurant had poor signage. Enjoy Toronto."}
{"text":"All the superlative reviews about this place are true. Each of the dishes are delicious, demonstrating amazing technique and culinary artistry. There are five main dishes, but interspersed with amuse bouches and other intermezzos, and it came out to almost 10 in the end. Each one was so perfect and delicate, you didn't want to touch them and spoil the presentation. My only criticism is that I couldn't make the sensation of tasting each dish last longer in my mouth.  Getting a reservation is nearly impossible, and I only got one through sheer luck by calling just as somebody else cancelled. The reservation site was booked for months, to the latest possible date that they book for. And it's a tasting menu at an exciting new restaurant, so unless you're made of money it's not something that you'd be able to do regularly anyway. But for a really special occasion that you're planning months in advance, it's totally worth it :)"}
{"text":"This restaurant is usually booked 60 days out but I'd heard so much about it that I decided to take my chances at the bar. The cocktails were outstanding. John the bartender knows his stuff; the guy is so busy but still manages to keep it together and keeps everyone satisfied. The bread n butter was fantastic and definitely worth trying. Can't remember everything that I had but the rice chips with tartare combo, I just couldn't get enough of. I'm hoping I can get in there again before I leave Toronto. The other reviews are a true representation of what to expect."}
{"text":"First off, the best service ever. loved how they got the elevator, opened the washroom doors without lingering outside, got my crumbs, and even put on my coat (with coat readily waiting as I made my way towards the exit).  My cup was always filled magically and my napkin sharply mysteriously folded neatly. They were friendly and awesome and couldn't be any better.     They only serve the tasting menu at $105 with wine pairings $75; and also have a comfortable walk-in bar area (booths).   The good: overall loved the food; each dish was presented like a masterpiece that I can't even describe; think it was nine courses or so; with a choice between two over four courses in between (but of course, we got one of each and shared) which I LOVED this extra variety; we had a good filling as I felt incredibly stuffed at the end.   The bad: a good amount of dishes I found were surprisingly too salty (and I grew up on salty food); the 2nd and 3rd dish or so were meh (felt like it was the flavour of every palette for me-sweet, salty, bitter), weirded me out; also some dishes hinted towards chinese cuisine (e.g. chicken mushroom jus course); I wanted it to feel more.. French..  Overall: wish I was able to terrain all the fancy places to compare; but this place was top notch for me!"}
{"text":"Finally had the chance to eat here after making a reservation 60 days in advance. Make sure you are waiting at midnight on open table or else you'll be waiting a while.   We had the dinner tasting menu with wine pairing. The two opening dishes were a bit under whelming.  The mains were amazing and made the dinner well worth it. My girlfriend ordered the beef and I had the pork. Both were cooked perfectly.   The wine pairing was very generous, we had nearly 4 glasses of wine each. The sommelier really took his time to explain the wine and made an effort to accommodate after we let him know that we didn't like one of the wines.   In total the meal came to just over $430 with tip. All in all I enjoyed the meal but will likely not return anytime soon. The food was good but the meal in my opinion did not justify all the hype. Worth checking out but go in with your expectations in check."}
{"text":"So glad to have been able to get this reservation from a friend of mine who couldn't make it last minute! The food was delicious - from presentation to creativity, and taste - so good! My partner got the wine-pairing option and he enjoyed the pairing and the full descriptions of each wine that was paired with each dish. The service was also excellent - from the moment you step foot in the door, you are well taken care of."}
{"text":"If you were lucky enough to visit Susur in it's early years you know what is possible given the right Kitchen. ALO delivers this in spades!  That so pedestrian an elevator could lead to such gastronomic delights is shocking. You're asked to sit at the bar to wait for your table to be readied, don't pass this up. With just a few well thought out questions the barkeep will produce you personal cocktail from his vast repertoire and you will love it.  Tasting menus with two choices make so much sense and made all four of us very very happy. On a hundred scale the worst of them would register a 93 and more than half were worthy of perfect 100.   The only slight negative would be the wine pairings. Maybe it was just the uninspired detailings of each pour by our sommelier? Maybe I'm being unfair in comparing her explanations to the Bourdain like stories we were so lucky to experience from the lead sommelier at George only a few months ago?  Having said all that if there is a better resto in Toronto I would LOVE to go there."}
{"text":"It's great having this calibre of restaurant in Toronto finally, however, there are some minor flaws.   3.5 stars for me, when rating it to comparable restaurants, but 4 stars when comparing it to the Toronto food scene.   While expensive, price to value wise, it's very appropriate and on par with Toronto and the quality of food.   In terms of food, it's modern giving a lot of attention to flavours and textures. This is great, but conceptually, it makes some dishes fall flat on their faces, and others, you wonder where a specific pairing has been your entire life. There's however nothing remarkable here if you're used to eating at restaurants like this around the world - what's simply remarkable is that someone is getting this right in Toronto again (the only closest comparison in Toronto was Claudio Aprile's Colborne Lane, which he sadly closed).  Where things fall slightly short is service and atmosphere. Many are talking about how Alo is going to the be the first in Toronto to bring us a Michelin star, but service wise, there's small details missing. For example, not offering any form of coat check (in a winterous city like Toronto, and at those prices, this is a minimum expectation). Or atmosphere wise, being located in China town to save on rent isn't the most appealing, but the ventilation of the place is so poor that you are greeted with the smell of deep fryer as soon as you get off the elevators.(I guess that part is appropriate for China town).   Overall, I think the value in this place is simply stopping by for a drink and eating at the bar. If you want the full dinner experience, saving it for a special occasion makes sense, only because there really isn't much competition in this calibre in the city.   However, I feel it's not worth the total experience for me personally."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants I've ever been to. Definitely a main contender for the first Michelin Star in Canada. The atmosphere mixed with the professionalism of the staff, the incredible food and perfectly plated experience.  Make sure you try the pairings. I've never had such interesting wines!"}
{"text":"Customer service is excellent.  They take care of every detail...  Pulling your chair when u sit down, folding your napkin when you walk away from your desk,  change utensils for every meal, etc.   Food wise is hands down one of the best restaurants. No words to describe the amazing experience I've had.   PS. Gotta make reservation 2-3 months in advance.  Tasting menu changes every season."}
{"text":"What everyone is saying is right!  Seriously without a doubt one of if not my favourite dining experiences ever!    I was there for my birthday last week and everything was impeccable from the drinks to the food to the service!    I loved the little touches like how they gave me a personalized menu that said Happy Birthday...and of course and extra bday dessert ;)  I think it is totally worth the price for the level of service and food you get...plus as others have mentioned there are several mini courses between the main courses and as others have mentioned the bread course is a course of its own!  The courses are perfectly spaced out where you don't feel rushed or like you are waiting too long.  Since it was my bday I had the wine pairing w/ dinner and everything was perfectly matched and explained.  Some of my fav courses were probably the bread/butter, king salmon, rack of pork...and of course the dessert course ;) But seriously everything was delicious!  I can't wait to find another reason to go back there!"}
{"text":"Alo was recently (Mar 1, 2017) named the top Canadian restaurant to dine at for 2017, but it was most definitely the top restaurant in 2016 as well for those in the know.  I had the pleasure of dining at Alo twice - once in the dining room (9 courses), and once at the Chef's Counter (15 courses). Do note that as of this writing, the chef's counter reservations are only available by calling in, whereas the dining room area can be reserved online.  The menu at Alo changes frequently, but courses such as the bread & butter course (served mid-meal) and the gougere puffs (variations on the accompaniments) starter seem to be staples - not that I am complaining, because they are absolutely delectable. It is hard to imagine freshly baked bread with house-churned butter being a course, but once you take the first bite, you will deem it worthy as such.  I especially appreciate Alo's creative usage of niche ingredients that are normally not used elsewhere.  Some stand out dishes:  1. Finger limes with ryeberry ice cream and white chocolate was a pleasant mix of sweet and sour, with nice textural contrast between the soft smooth ice cream, the caviar-like finger limes and the crunchy rough chocolate crumble.   2. Truffle lovers would undoubtedly enjoy as much as I did when white truffle was generously shaven in front of me onto a bed of koshihikari rice risotto, by none other than the Head Chef Patrick Kriss himself.  3. Matsutake mushrooms are showcased in a single dish to demonstrate the transformation of this ingredient from its raw form (with intense, grassy flavours), to a milder sweeter form once poached and puréed. And finally, in jelly format exuding elegant subtle flavours sandwiched alongside a rich tasting foie gras terrine.  4. Warm himrod grapes glazed with vermouth and ones simply frozen was a creative play on temperature. This was served on a gorgeous hand-made plate with creme fraiche ice cream, chestnuts and roasted amaranth - a delight to the senses, both visually and on the palate.  Dishes such as the grilled A5 Waygu beef and hamachi sashimi were almost disappointing by comparison - not because of a lack of deliciousness, but rather by the limitations on what you can do creatively with these ingredients.  Service has been impeccable both times I have dined there. Even though one would expect some snobbishness and elitism in such a restaurant, I received no such attitude from them - and that to me is an important distinction from other top restaurants.  If I were to be disappointed by Alo in any way, it is perhaps the difficulty in obtaining a reservation. I highly recommend going \"all-in\" with the chef's counter tasting with wine pairings, but if you are trying to organize a meal with 3 or more, I'd suggest to tame your ambitions...for now.  For those visiting and unable to secure a reservation, Alo has a bar area with a separate bar menu serving a la carte items. Do note that you would not be able to obtain items on the tasting menus there."}
{"text":"My husband and I came there for our anniversary and we thoroughly enjoyed this dinning experience with top notch service and food.   Upon arriving at the Alo, we were immediately greeted by a hostess downstairs, she checked us in and called for the elevator.  When the elevator door opened, the first thing I noticed was the beautiful decor and the friendly staff that all greeted us as we walk by.  It made me felt like I was someone important.  The service throughout the night was just impeccable with very professional and attentive staff that made sure your were well taken care of.   As for the food, I think I have died and gone to food heaven.  We had 5 courses with just the right portions. I like the fact that despite it's a set menu, you still had a choice with the main and dessert.  All the flavours blended so well together, all the meat were cooked to perfection.  The presentation was equally impressive with so many little details put into the dishes.    I know $95 might be a bit steep but it's worth it!!  Splurge and go try it for yourself! Oh the wine paring is a must if you like wine."}
{"text":"Food is complex with a depth and variety of flavors and textures. Quality and tastes are exactly what you would expect from a Michelin caliber restaurant. This is on par with 3 Michelin starred Joel Robuchon in Las Vegas, but without the theatrics and financial punishment. It is quite difficult to secure a reservation given the size of the restaurant and the small number of tables, but this is why Service was so personal and outstanding. Every member of the staff flows reminiscent of a choreographed ballet. It really is quite something to watch in itself."}
{"text":"UNBELIEVABLE service. Food was undoubtedly great but I wasn't mind-blown by all the items. Regardless, it's truly a fine dining experience that's perfect for a special occasion. It's definitely on the pricy side once you add in the wine pairings and extra dishes / drinks but worth a go for the experience.  PRICE:  I'd recommend sitting at the chef's table so you can watch all the action in the kitchen. It's priced at $155 per person vs $105 for the regular dining and you're served a different menu at a bar in front of the kitchen. I think it's worth the extra money for a special occasion if you can get it.  Wine pairings are $85 per person and cocktails were ~$15. As a typical Asian lightweight, I opted to share a wine pairing between my boyfriend and I (and it was still pleeeenty of booze of the both of us.)   FOOD:  Despite the seemingly small portions, we were absolutely stuffed by the end 3 hours later. I really liked the lobster, uni, scrambles egg with caviar, pasta, and the desserts. The sashimi plates didn't blow me away. And the canapés in the beginning weren't for me.   Overall though, the food was very fresh and tasty. The presentation was really great too. By sitting at the chef's table, you can witness the attention and detail each chef puts into creating the food (plating with tweezers!) I was even impressed by how one guy was scooping and plating the butter for the bread. It was truly a sight to watch.   SERVICE: The service was UNBELIEVABLE. They were very observant about everything. They even had portable chargers available for my dead blackberry and a table edge hanger for my purse. No glass was left empty and no napkin was unfolded. The staff was great. When we paid the bill and went to the door, they already had staff holding our coats and scarves. Talk about service!"}
{"text":"Marathon. Memorable. Money. These were the three words that came to my mind after this experience.   Marathon: The dinner took almost four hours to complete 16 courses with wine pairings.   Memorable: Each of the sixteen courses and wine pairings had a story and a purpose. For example, one of the wine pairings came from Greece where the moisture has a high level of salt content. This wine was paired with a seafood dish to bring out the taste of the ocean. Low key - I was skeptical at first, but after a few glasses of wine...  needless to say, the stories became quite entertaining and believable. I would say that 5 dishes were phenomenal (5 stars+), 4 dishes were amazing (5 stars), 5 dishes were delicious (4 stars) and 2 dishes were good (3 stars).   *** We had 16 instead of 15 since one of our dishes tasted terrible. The service is impeccable as the chef was very accommodating in making us a complimentary dish.   Money: Lets just say I will make sure not to throw out the McDonald coupons I get in the email for a couple weeks... For 2 people, it came out to approximately $500.   All in all, I would highly recommend people to try Alo (great for special occasions). The menu changes on a constant basis, so your experience may be different than someone else's. One thing for sure that will be the same is... the cost ;)"}
{"text":"Had tried this place last year. It was a hidden surprise!! Should have gotten Michelin stars!"}
{"text":"We'll start with the positives: Alo has a beautiful ambience, reminiscent of NYC fine dining. The decor is simple and taste full. It sits upstairs on a busy city street corner overlooking the hustle and bustle. The contrast is charming.  As expected the service is exquisite. The food itself is also refined and elegant...but not extraordinary. Almost every dish on the menu had either shellfish or another form of seafood leaving the diversity limited. In addition I found them complex in theory but not execute. Nothing was 'bad' per se but I wasn't wowed. For the price we paid I expected more. I had a lunch at Eleven Madison Park, one of the greatest restaurants in the world for under $80/person and about 100x more delicious. At $89 per person at Alo, it's just not worth it. If they had an a la cart menu or more varied selection I'd consider returning. But Toronto is a big city and there are plenty of other fish in the sea."}
{"text":"My review is based on the dining experience at The Bar at Alo.   Ambience -  Although the restaurant locates on the top floor of the old building. The interior is very modern and chic. The fine dining area is totally separate so the customers at the bar won't interrupt the diners. The music in the background was not too loud and still allowed us to converse comfortably. There are seats around the bar table and individual tables for bigger group (2-4 people).  Things for improvement - The seating is comfortable yet I don't feel the tables are too durable because it was easily moved. I was quite cautious and try not to knock it over. :(  Service -   We arrived at Alo after 10 PM for some drinks and snacks; we were greeted by a friendly staff and directed us to bar section. Overall, the service was very friendly and attentive. The waiter was very nice and recommended us a few appetizers and drinks based on our preferences. She even advised to order less dishes than we planned to (we were excited to try as many dishes as possible! :D). We are very thankful for her advice because food portion was just right after the dessert.   Drinks -  They offer wide selection of cocktails and wines. We opted for non-alcohol drinks which are limited to 3 choices.   We got the Black tea lemon, passion fruit orange. Both were refreshing and we enjoyed them.   Food -  Food menu is simple and mainly seafood, a few meat choices (Pork, beef) and very few with veggies.   We ordered two seafood dishes and dessert.   Overall, it's no doubt they use fresh and premium ingredients. The culinary skills was top notch. The savoury dishes were delicious but didn't blow out my mind.  Yet the dessert was so good although the presentation was not as appealing as the other dishes. It combined different flavours and sensations; it was very refreshing. I would come back just for the dessert.   I will definitely come back for dinner and snacks. I would love trying the tasting menu to fully experience the restaurant."}
{"text":"Everything said about Alo is true! Exceptional food and service. And this was in the bar area of the restaurant. Each dish was exquisite and the drink pairings perfect. Can't wait to get a sitting in the main area."}
{"text":"I have been debating with my self on writing about my experience at Alo for more than four months and now I am doing it.  I wanted to go here for over a year since I heard a lot about it and the hype was to the roof, so my girlfriend made a booking 2 months a head and there we go the night finally arrived.  We walked in and were greeted by the hostes at the elevator and another hostes at the restaurant who took our coats and showed us our table. First thing I noticed was 3 empty table and till end of the night they were all empty. Apparently they are not that busy anymore so no more 2 months reservation is required. Also with DNR app you can make same night reso.  Server was very friendly but he was not very knowledgeable and helpful. He offered us to get two different set of the tasting menu to be able to try everything so we did so. The menu was 10 courses. For drinks we got couple cocktails including one from their older menu.  Drinks were good but nothing special. Food start coming out and the portions were super tiny (1 to maximum 3 bites) which is normal for tasting. Unfortunately until end of all the savoury dishes both of us were still hungry. So we received three courses of dessert which made us think we are kind of full for at least 15 min because of all the sugar.   We paid $110/person only for the food before tax & tip. The saddest part, Chef/owner Patrick Kriss is when we walked out, we had to cross the Spadina and go to Mc donalds and get a big mac. As a chef that is so painful for me that my guest walk out hungry and get a big mac.  Unfortunately because of the hype around Alo no one cares about anything else. I have eat in many starred restaurants around the world and Alo is not even close to any of them.  I definitely will not go back to Alo since there are many better fine dinning in Toronto."}
{"text":"My review is going to be like Alo's kitchen: Clean and appreciative of food. It is an experience to watch the kitchen in action. From watching each stationed chef work on each dish in a spotless kitchen, to seeing extra flecks of salt and inadequate sprigs being removed manually from the plate before it's brought to you, it is a real dining pleasure. It did not feel like 3 hours: Time flies when you're having fun."}
{"text":"We stopped in and had the small plates in the bar.  The food was outstanding and the service was excellent.  I would highly recommend this restaurant and would return.  In fact the next time I am in Toronto I will make sure to book a reservation ahead of time.  From the small plates in the bar I had the steak, asparagus and a cheese dish for desert.  All of it was outstanding and the server took the time to explain our dishes and answer all of our question."}
{"text":"So happy I chose this for my boyfriends birthday dinner as we had such a delicious and memorable meal here!  We sat at the chefs table and had the 7 course meal. $130pp (came to $400 for two ppl plus two drinks,tax and tip) and the meal lasted almost 4 hours. At first we thought we would go get poutine or street meat after if we were still hungry (tasting portions can be so small) but we were beyond stuffed (it may have even been a tad too much food) and we practically crawled out the there and tko'd as soon as we got home. We skipped the wine pairing (thank god or we would have burst) but each settled for an a la carte drink: he had the old fashioned, I had a glass of white - both good. Had to book 2 months in advance for a Saturday night seating.   Pros: the good dishes were AMAZING. the wagyu was incredible, soft scrambled eggs with truffle puree was one of the most intense things I have even eaten, grits with shave truffle was so unique and special (and i usually dislike grits) and the poke was perfect. The house made bread with soft warm butter omg....please start selling this! Lovely dinnerware was quickly replaced after each dish and the plating of each course was beautiful. Washrooms were so clean and pretty (weird adjective to describe a washroom, I know), and as soon as I returned to my seat there was someone instantly behind me to pull out my chair and the napkin had been refolded. They even had our coats out and ready when we left and the bill comes with a keepsake menu of the night, sealed in a small envelope. Nice little touches :) Definitely a great place for a special occasion.  Some cons, which is why I didn't give 5 stars as I think for the price point and reputation these things should be improved: not all the dishes were great. some were underwhelming and really not good at all (ie the scallop, sashimi, canapes, all the desserts, weird cornbread bites that were part of the petit fours..). We had one lightly grilled fish dish (makarel?) and my boyfirends piece was incredible but mine had no flesh and was chewy and grizzly and not edible. Plus when they took the plate away they should have seen it and resolved it, as that one bite was all that I got due to the tasting size. The service was great in some ways but not overly friendly - maybe the norm in poshy places, but I think our server could have been a bit more personable. Furthermore, we sat there about 20 minutes when we arrived before anyone even approached us or took a drink order. He also did not really welcome us (or even introduce himself) and explain the menu/how many courses/confirmed our preferences etc. The biggest annoyance was the atmosphere of the chefs table seating. I have sat at other chefs tables and loved it - it felt worth the premium fee - but here, it really felt like they ran out of room and just plunked us at the metal counter where they places the ready dishes for servers to deliver to tables :/ It was not cozy/comfortable/premium/classy and since it was a surprise dinner for my bf he looked at me bewildered when we were seated and asked \"why are they seating us at this counter???\" as he longingly looked towards the cozy restaurant tables. Also the pathway from the kitchen to the dining area, and bathroom to dining area is right behind the \"chefs table' so there is a constant flow of noisy traffic behind you. We even had people waiting or people on phone calls loitering behind us for the whole meal. Not a great setting for a special birthday dinner. Aside from that it was neat to watch the hustle and bustle of the kitchen and see the effort put into each dish (minus the part where the dessert chef licked the spoon he used to scoop some chocolate and then put it back in the holder before the next use....errrrrrr).  Despite these shortcomings, we had a really good time here and would definitely recommend for a special event....but I would go for the 5 course tasting menu instead and avoid chefs table seating~  Would I return? - For special occasion only Parking? - Street parking on Queen, green Ps nearby Value for $? - Good Space? - Small/mid size dining area, small bar area Ventilation? - Good Service? - Good"}
{"text":"My bf took me here for my bday, and sat at the chef's table which was a great treat. I wish I was told how much more it would be compared to the regular seating. However the additional dishes were worth the extra money.   I think altogether there were 16 dishes and I received a complimentary bday cake.  All dishes were amazing but if I had to choose, my hands down favourites were the foie gras amuse bouches, the raw scallops, the whipped potatoes and the flank steak....   This meal was the most expensive meal of my life but I must say through and through I enjoyed it.   I can't wait to try aloette!!"}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: A fantastic spot to go to even if you CAN'T get a reso. Also, in the world of fine-dining, Alo gets top marks for being a good \"value\".  Perhaps in the vein of Daniel Wells (NYT food critic), who has been placing a stronger emphasis on \"value\" in his reviews, I would put Alo close to the very top, if not THE very top of the places I've eaten at. Sure, if you have the company charge card, any meal will be nomtastic, but for us mere mortals, it'd be nice to not have to take out a loan to pay for the meal.   Everyone KNOWS the food is stellar. And yes, the wine pairing is worth it! With that out of the way, let's move on, shall we? Perhaps the one thing that impressed me the most was the attentive but not intrusive service, and the professional but not stuffy attitude. You're there to have fun, and it seems like the staff are enjoying it as much as you are.   But what if you can't get a table (like the 99% of us who try)? Fret not, because the bar and lounge area of Alo is a great place for a drink, a bite, and definitely a date! Even during peak hours, I've always been seated by the bar almost immediately, and it's definitely one of my go-to places if I'm feeling fancy. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We waited for months in anticipation for our special meal at Alo's. As expected service was top notch and servers were very attentive. The dishes were creative but nothing out of this world and frankly quite bland. We've been to Michelin starred restaurants and in comparison, Alo still needs quite a bit of work to be near those places. I was expecting it to be something wowza worthy since the hype. It's a fun, adventurous night out but it wasn't that memorable, there was not one dish I remember was amazing."}
{"text":"I'd been waiting over a year to find out what all the hype was about. Now I know why many call it the best restaurant in the city - it didn't just live up to its billing, it blew my expectations out of the water.  I want to be careful not to spoil the experience, so won't get into specifics, but first and foremost I have to mention the service. It's outstanding. They will make you feel like royalty from the moment you arrive, to the moment they have your coat ready when you leave. Everyone is friendly, helpful, knowledgeable, and there to ensure your visit is nothing short of incredible.  The food. Oh my goodness, the food. The tasting menu is ever-changing, but some of the most unique, inventive combinations of flavour, texture and even presentation I've seen. It was like a party was in my mouth, and everyone was invited.  One last thing - DO. THE. WINE. PAIRINGS. The sommelier was amazing - knowledgeable, and making the experience an adventure in its own right. The way the wines selected complimented the dishes was, as you might expect, perfect.  If only I were made of money - I would be here every week."}
{"text":"I could tell you all about Alo.  I could tell you that I hate Chris Nuttall-Smith's attitudes toward ambition in the Toronto culinary scene, and that I hate how much he's right about this restaurant.  I could tell you that the service is at once impeccable and unpretentious; warm and welcoming despite a level of cuisine that would seem to inherently demand a certain level of stodginess and down-the-nose disapproval.  I could tell you that I came out of Yelp review retirement to laud this singular establishment; or that I just had one of the Top Ten Greatest Meals Of My Life; and that it's 10 to 2 in the morning and I can't not hop on Yelp to spread the joy that is this restaurant.  I could say that the veal and pan fried sweet breads changed the way I view an entire meat; that the bread course is worthy of being a course on its own, and that it's okay to eat that butter by the knife-full; and that the drinks are great and the space is wonderful; and that someone sets the washroom right every time you leave it, tucking the tail end of the toilet paper into the roll swiftly after your departure.  I could tell you a million things, and it would all seem like hyperbole, or bias.  Instead I'll tell you this.  Just go.    Just go and see what alums from Auberge Du Pommier, Acadia, Daniel and more can do when you set them loose at an iconic Toronto intersection, in a space that was once a talent agency cum dress shop.  See what our city's capable of when someone with the vision, ability, and opportunity applies an entire team of talented individuals toward a singular goal.  Feel proud for being a Torontonian.  And when they offer that cheese course?  Go for it."}

{"text":"I have to thank chef Patrick Kriss and front of the house Amanda Bradley for bringing World Class fine dining experience to Toronto!  As someone that \"travel to eat\", I had been planning most of my oversea trips around Michelin starred restaurants: Osaka, Hong Kong, Macau, Chicago, New York... Toronto as one of the major cities in Canada had also been lagging behind Montreal and Vancouver for Higher End, Michelin's worthy dining establishment.  Until Alo opens its doors back in July 2015.  Planning - Reservation  Reservation can a challenge but worth your effort. Plan accordingly as Opentable reservation is available 90 days out. I was planning to visit Alo as a solo diner but one of my friends was kind enough to join me so I can have the opportunity to try out every offerings on Alo's Tasting Menu.  Tasting Menu  Everything is seasonal. I recommend visiting in different seasons to appreciate what Alo's team offers. For 2 people, I would suggest ordering one each \"appetizers\", \"main\" and \"dessert\". Presentation was top notch! Pleasing for the eyes and so colourful too! Every dish was a piece of art.  And of course, we all let our cameras eat first and took some photos!  We ordered some tea to go with our desserts. 9 different kinds of Solane Tea is served here! You can even smell them before ordering!  OVERALL IMPRESSION  A combination of interesting taste profile and texture. The whole meal did take almost 3 hours so hopefully you like your dinner mate. Service here is top notch. The hospitality team (front of the house) is just amazing! Attentive and polite: a 5 star dinner service!  Will I be back?! Yes, in a heartbeat!  My meal at Alo Restaurant is one of the most memorable meals I had in Toronto.  PRO TIP  If you want to have a taste of Alo Restaurant without making a reservation, the best is drop by their bar area for a drink and a snack. The bar at Alo Restaurant has this relax and chill vibe which is great for pre or after dinner drink!"}
{"text":"So I've  been here about 5-6 times in the past couple of years. Cant believe i havent made a review after all this time. I guess its a good thing since now i can provide a pretty honest  review.  Service: it deserves a 5 star it is always excellent.  They have never missed a step here servers always professional. The wine pours from the tasting is generous. No complaints here.  Food is mostly good. Overall most of the dishes ive had here are  4-5 star rating. Ive had a few miss and those dish were pretty mediocre in flavour. So i can see why some folk on yelp would give it such a low rating.  After waiting for months and end up having an unfortunate bad experiance.  I guess there really no average dishes for me here either it was extremely good or just meh. The food was either too bland or not overly exciting. Maybe they are just trying too hard to keep things fresh? I would say 80% of the dishes ive had here were great and i would come back.   I gave this place a 4 star rating mainly because out of all the times ive been here i remeber twice my food was just average, but the other times the food was great and it totally lived up to the 5 star rating everyone has been giving them."}
{"text":"A wonderful restaurant... If you are a man.  Alo has an excellent and reasonably priced tasting menu, with very attentive service. It's got a central location and a chef that personally stays out on the floor to oversee service all evening.  However, I will no longer be recommending this restaurant to others. During the three visits I have made with my fiancée, the reservations have been under my name, and I have paid. Despite this, The staff treats me as a pretty ornament, smiled at but not spoken to, while Mark gets chatted up, by the sommelier, the chef, accosted by the bartender on his way to the washroom. The effect is somewhat like an Old Boys Club. I get enough of this elsewhere... I'll pass, thanks."}
{"text":"Amazing experience. Great night with an engaging menu and well - paired drinks. A must try in Toronto."}
{"text":"I really wanted to try Alo but didn't have a reservation so I decided to go to their bar area for apps and drinks instead as a reservation is not required.  Finding the restaurant is a bit of a challenge as there are no signs and you enter through a tiny non-descript lobby next to a nail salon where a waitress greets you and presses a button to a very tiny and quirky old elevator which feels like it could break down at any moment. It's a rather slow and clausterphobic ride up to the restaurant -- it's more charming than it sounds. The bar area is rather cozy with about 10 seats at the bar and another 10 seats with tables. The menu consisted of apps/small plates which are different from their tasting menu. There is also an extensive cocktail menu, organized by drink styles, which had recipes next to it if you want to make the same drink at home which I thought was fun. The service was excellent, very friendly and helpful, though I thought the waiter was a bit too eager to take or plates or glasses away before we were finished. The food was great -- I had the Hamachi tartare and pork belly which were outstanding. Excellent layering of flavours. I thought the presentation was a bit lacking as both dishes looked similar in terms of plating and garnishing, and didn't look as clean and artful as their tasting menu plates.  Because the seated tables in the bar area are very snug, you are almost sitting with the people next to you, which is not bad but I had a couple douchey guys in overly-trendy suits sitting next to me who had a couple drinks and were talking obnoxiously loud and dropping f-bombs which was really rude and annoying and was a black spot in my otherwise nice relaxing evening.  I'm sure to return to eat in their dining room and experience their tasting menu with wine pairing as everyone has been raving about."}
{"text":"The hype is real. Yes, you will spend copious money...close to $500 plus tax and tip for 2 people if you choose to go with tasting menus and wine pairings. And I HIGHLY recommend that you do, at least once. For a special occasion. Or even if it's just a regular night, a tasting menu with wine pairings at Alo IS a special occasion.  I visited in early February on a Thursday night with a date and there was not a single misstep. A greeter professionally meets you on the ground floor before you get on the elevator. A hostess takes your coats and greets you on the 2nd floor. We are a bit early and we are shown a seat near the bar. And because our table ends up being a few minutes late, we are offered complimentary drinks. They are lovely.  Once the menu starts everything is done to high-dining perfection. We never have to ask for water, the table is always cleared. Cutlery is always clean and set as needed. The wait between courses is the perfect amount of time to enjoy the previous course and wine without rushing or going hungry. The waiters and waitresses are dressed elegantly, are polite, professional and knowledgeable. Of particular note was the sommelier; his love and knowledge of wine was astound.  And the food - divine, complex, inventive, exciting. Each course was different and there was no disappointments. The wines were paired perfectly and the variety was impressive. I had a veg tasting menu and my date had the vegan option and we were both impressed. No fake or imitation meats, no boring salads. And all worthy of a special night out, meat-eater or not you will not be disappointed.   And the perfect last touch to the evening is a cute card in an 'Alo' sealed envelope with your menu and wine pairings for you to dream about. Make it a point to visit Alo at least once."}
{"text":"I am so in love with dining here at Alo. You get excellent service, the friendliest and professional staff and orgasmic tasteful small plates by the best chef Patrick Chriss. John is an amazing mixologist and creates sexy but tasteful cocktails. Amanda is as beautiful as the mood she creates for her customers. Chef Chriss is so passionate about craft and love of food that no foodie will walk away without feeling astonished. One of my favorite places to eat in Toronto."}
{"text":"What to try??  You can't choose a la carte. It's basically a prix fixe menu you sit down for dinner for $105 pp. You can either sit at the bar, the dining area or the chefs table so at least you can choose there because depending on where you sit, the food you get is slightly different. You can get wine pairings with the menu for an additional $75. It's my second time dining with alo and I have to say the food has been consistently amazing! From the dish selection to the plating, it surely satisfied my palate and my eyes. I really like how the food is placed on the plate and the fine details they think of for each dish. We had Christopher, the sommelier serve us the wine for each pairing and he would go on to tell us a story taking us to different parts of Europe for each wine he introduced. The service, like last time at the restaurant, was truly and consistently impeccable. They take care of you from start to finish and they really put the extra effort to make the dining experience for their patrons extraordinary. Really enjoyed the company of their staff. The only thing that is still a mystery to me is the shouting they have in the kitchen from time to time. Not sure what that signifies but if that peaks your curiosity too next time you dine with them, perhaps you can ask them!  Last tip?   Seems like everyone books online! So be set to book 60 days in advance for the day you're looking for and stay up till midnight to do the booking. Rumour has it that if you persistently call them and let them know the date you're looking for, they'll try to help you out. If you also call two days in advance from the day you want booked, you might be lucky because cancellations last minute is common at the restaurant. Good luck booking!"}
{"text":"Incredible service and imaginative dishes that are innovative and delicious! Highly recommend this dinning experience as it is one of a kind."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a michellin star I would!!! Best meal ive had in a very very long time!! Exquisite!! Love love love this place!!"}
{"text":"What is all the hype about?   Alo Restaurant the best Toronto has to offer. Our No. 1  I DON'T THINK SO.  Let me start off by saying you need to book 2 months in advance and have your credit card ready when doing so.  As your reservation get closer you will be contacted to confirm your reservation. One of which you will be read the riot act  If you are more than 15 min late they will give your table away. They will inform you it's a tasting menu only in the dinning room. Max. length of time you can sit at your table is 3 hours.  I think you get the picture.  Best part of the meal was the wine pairings.   We enjoyed some delicious wines that we never would have tasted other wise.  OK.  Now for the food!  Some of the tastings were so small they should be handing out a magnifying glass so you would be able to find it on the plate.  2 of the tastings were excellent while the rest of them were just Ok.  Cost of meal with wine pairings and a coffee afterwards just over  $215.00 per person with tax before gratuities.  Food.                      3 star Presentation.         4 star Service.                  4 star Decor.                     3 star  Overall experience.   3 1/2 stars.  Certainly not worth the wait for the reservation nor the price."}
{"text":"A5 Wagyu Beef Tartare  Style. Substance. Service.  The picture posted is Course #3 amongst 15+ of the Kitchen Counter Chefs Tasting Menu.  Renowned Chef Patrick Kriss meticulously constructs each dish, and provides a concise and vivid description of each work of edible visual masterpiece. My server Quentin was a star in his own right, professionally and proficiently attending to my inquiries, while taking the time to chat with me about favorite dining establishments. I picked his brain about preparation of the outstanding bread and butter made in-house. Needless to say, these two, along with the kitchen and front of house staff, were incredible.  Toronto is very fortunate to have @alorestaurant as part of its ever-growing culinary scene. If you're as lucky as I was to get a chance to dine here, I just have one word for you.  GO"}
{"text":"Alo isnt about eating. If your hungry, go somewhere else. Alo is about an experience. It's about tasting the mind of a young, highly skilled, highly talented chef, as he reaches for the ultimate heights of his culinary abilities. It's a sensual adventure, pushing your palate beyond its comfort and redefining your taste buds. It's about sharing a special moment with a loved one or a group of friends. The dinner will change you as a diner, your perspective about food and wine and your expectations of what a well run, well oiled, dining experience should be.  First of all I'm not a chef, so much of what was offered to me on the plate was beyond my understanding. But the textures, precision, complexity and balance of each plate were more than obvious to even a layman like myself. Each bite was like little champagne bubbles bursting on different parts of my tongue. From the delicate petit-fours that were offered to us at the start of our meal, too our final course of a rich, creamy, luscious, dark chocolate and mint dessert, our tastes buds were constantly being challenged and rewarded. Not every bite was personally pleasing. The Pacific Halibut was perfectly cooked and purposefully under seasoned, so that it could combine with the silky smooth emulsion. Unfortunately it just didn't work for me but the lady at the next table was overjoyed with the dish. But that is the beauty and challenge of a tasting menu. Too appreciate new flavours and confirm those tastes that you may never appreciate.  Please, please, please order the wine pairing. The quality, quantity and innovation of the pairings (who ever expected a Madeira in the middle of their meal too work so well) is an eye opener and at just $65 a person, maybe the best value on any menu in the city. Christopher our Somm, brought an academic charm and understanding too our meal, that my wife and I both appreciated.  The service is truly impeccable. Everything was quietly but efficiently, taken care of. From a napkin being replaced before I had a chance too ask, too our water glasses always being full. The service at Alo is about understanding the needs of the customer before the customer even knows what those needs are. Thanks too Tracy and the tall, slim, bespectacled young lady, whose name we never got, for adding so much more too our experience."}
{"text":"Best dining experience! From the greeting to the send off. They do care about the art of hospitality. Outstanding dishes filled with so many layers of flavour and texture. A lot of thought goes into this place and you can tell.  I think the fact that the tasting menu doesn't change for a few weeks is what makes the staff calm (even in the kitchen - can see them) and allows them to perfect dishes and increases quality and consistency. Out of the 8-9 courses there were a lot of favorites! Only dish that was not my fav was the steak. Cut was a bit chewy which made it tough, though the meat was tender, good flavor though. I feel like I am at a loss of words to describe, you just have to experience it for yourself. Friendly attentive staff that go above and beyond and welcome you in an unpretentious manner. As my bf said, they were like a well choreographed dance. Explanation of the dishes and suggestions for wine were great. Even their sommelier was attentive to our expressions after tasting the wine.  A sweet little bday treat as well. If you really want to treat someone take them here!"}
{"text":"Service is extremely great along with great atmosphere. Staffs here are very polite, definitely the best service I've ever received. Food choices are creative. My boyfriend and I had a great dining experience here."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, we went for the wine pairings which complemented to food well.  Staff we excellent, attentive, knowledgeable and friendly.  One thing stopped is giving 5 stars was the decor and physical space needs an update."}
{"text":"This team deserves at least 2 Michelin stars! Excellent service and world class food. Wonderful presentation and taste."}
{"text":"This hip and trendy French spot is hidden in a plain building with a lovely doorman/concierge to greet you in...if you can find it. No signs adorn the outside and the hype on getting in is serious! I was able to pop in and have the bar menu in the cocktail lounge ad hoc. The handmade cocktails looked phenomenal and the bar area is hip and sleek with a great view of the bottles and a large window letting in light and a view to the street below.   The scallops with sudachi creme fraiche, rice tempura and pickled daikon were light and delicious. The green beans in buttermilk, tarragon and marcona almonds were good, but not especially interesting. The chanterelle mushrooms, potatoes and chives were sooo fantastic!  My server was fairly attentive and very nice when she came by, although she did seem to disappear for long periods and I wanted to order more food. Great ambiance, great decor, funky sliding doors to hidden rooms add mystique. Good people-watching and nice wine list."}
{"text":"Alo is located at the corner of Spadina and Queen where it hidden in plain sight as the restaurant is located on the 3rd floor of a non-flashy building. One can walk pass by it without even knowing that it exists above. My party of 4 and I were lucky enough to make reservations in December 2017 to dine at Alo in February 2018. It is required that a $50 per person deposit be paid upfront when reserving (tasting menu was $125 per person). Having heard so many rave reviews about Alo, I knew I would be in for a night to remember. And a night it truly was. My party and I know generally what to expect at fine-dining restaurants but we were still blown away by the attentive service and detail that made the overall dining experience truly memorable.   Upon arrival at the restaurant, we quickly rode the elevator to the third floor and was personally greeted by the host and also offered a coat check. We were led to our seats and our waiter informed us that the meal would be a blind tasting menu as well as double checked any dietary restrictions that we may have. Looking around the dining room, it made sense as to why Alo is such a hard place to book reservations, there were only around 11-13 tables available. We were also offered a napkin service in which we could choose our own coloured napkins (a first for me!). We also asked the sommelier about wines in order to choose the perfect bottle of wine to accompany our meal.  The dishes of our blind tasting menu started off light and progressively went heavier. We were also given an envelope with the description of the dishes of our tasting menu at the end of the meal. These are the dishes we got served that night: - Amuse bouche - 4 bite sized delicious hor d'oeuvres. I don't remember what all of them were but there was foie gras pate involved. Each one had amazing flavour and texture. - Hokkaido sea scallop with barley miso, tangerine lace, grapes - The freshness of the scallop is what made this dish. The flavours of the sea were not lost and the other ingredients in the dish did not overpower the true flavour of the scallop. Delicate and fresh start. - Ora King Salmon with apple, wasabi, ginger shoots - Again, the quality of the ingredient is what made the dish shine. The other elements on the plate balanced and did not overpower the protein. - Scrambled eggs with dungeness crab, Hokkaido sea urchin, and Lomo Iberico. This was by far probably the favourite of the table. A very simple looking dish with so much flavour. The balance of each component worked so well with one another. My party joked that we wanted to lick our plates. - Chestnut scarpinocc (pasta) with fontina, butternut squash, and celery. This was probably my least favourite dish. The butternut squash was amazingly smooth though!  - St. Canut Pork Belly, Carolina Gold rice, brussel sprouts, huitlacoche - I've had a lot of pork belly in my life (comes with being Asian), but how this pork belly was cooked was amazing. The pork skin was crispy yet light (not heavy as we were used to), and the protein was succulent and moist. - Veal ribeye, baby gem lettuce, olive gastrique, capers - The quality of the veal was melt in your mouth and the other components of the dish were very unique and worked so well together. We were also given bread and butter during this dish and both the bread and butter were to die for. Very delicious! - Palate cleanser - meyer lemon, bay laurel, honey. - Dessert # 1 - Apple, yeast, caramelized whey; like a deconstructed apple pie/apple crumble. Very light and delicious. - Dessert # 2 - Coconut, caramelized white chocolate, yogurt  Service was amazing. Waiters were very attentive and catered to our requests. Water and wine was always refilled without asking. As expected, waiters moved aside if you decided to walk to the washroom. Napkins were folded every time you left the table. Dishes were carefully and quietly placed and taken away in sync by two different waiters. Cutlery was replaced after every dish based on what we would be eating next and waiters would explain each dish and answered any questions we would have. As we were leaving and made our way to the elevator, the hosts already had our coats and jackets out for us, ready to help us into our winter gear. I was expecting to ask the host for our coats as we left but the fact that they already knew made the experience much more special. Three of the hosts wished us farewell as we made our way into the elevator all mind-blown from this dining experience. That, truly, is service that goes above and beyond.  Overall, amazing service and food. This is definitely a dining experience to remember from beginning to end, one of the best in the city for sure. From the moment you step into Alo, be prepared to be blown away by the whole entire experience. We were taken on a food journey as we savored the complexity of flavours that harmoniously worked together. What left a lasting impression is the attentive and detailed service."}
{"text":"Alo Restaurant is a top rated restaurant in Toronto near the Graffiti Alley. In full disclosure, my friend and I didn't come here for the food. Our goal was drinks and we happened to order one dish to snack on. Here's our experience:  -Service: From the hostess to our bartender, we were greeted with open arms. They are on their game and very nice!  -Atmosphere: The space is beautiful. We were taken to the top floor and at first sat in the window sill set up as a place to sit. Then we migrated to the bar. The design is simple and regal.  -Drinks: Yep, best drinks in Toronto. Each time, we had the bartender create something based on our preferences and every time he confidently created a masterpiece that respected our preferences and pushed our boundaries in a safe way.  -Food: We ordered the burrata and it was fancy, but for a top rated restaurant we thought it lacked flavor and boldness.  Overall, Alo was a GREAT experience and we'll be back!"}
{"text":"We've been to Alo 3x now. The last one was at the Ched's table. Chef Kriss is funny, quiet but friendly. The whole experience was nothing short of amazing. The attention to detail is second to none. Our favourites this time are the duck and mussels. All the dishes were beautifully plated. Can't wait to be back! It's our favourite restaurant in Toronto! Love the Ramos gin fizz here, but I always kinda feel bad for giving the bartender an arm workout. Hahaha."}
