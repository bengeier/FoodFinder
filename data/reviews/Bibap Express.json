{"text":"First time having bibimbap and I really enjoyed it.   For $11 (raw salmon protein), the meal is fully customizable with your choosings. I appreciate the gourmet options available including brown or black rice, and fresh veggies like beets and alfalfa sprouts. This comes with a free miso soup also.   Friendly service and free lemon water!"}
{"text":"Conveniently located in the path. Lunch ranges from $8-10. I got a salmon bibimbap here. The portions are large and the sauce is quite spicy. The fried e.g. they add on the bibimbap is so cute. Lunches come with free miso soup.  I tried the sushi here and it is pretty average."}
{"text":"Holy crap, even the medium is super spicy - broke a sweat having my lunch!  It's not bibimbap like you'd get in a good high end Korean restaurant, where it all has baked together in the stone bowl - but you're getting a pretty good meal for $8 here - lots of choice of fresh veggies and friendly service, at least as friendly as you can expect when it's a Financial District mall food court - a nice change from the boring down in the PATH."}
{"text":"I've been here for lunch for numerous times during the workdays, and it's quickly becoming one of my favourite go-to lunch spots at the PATH that I also recommend to friends.   Located at the less well known spot of the PATH, the food court is less busy in comparison, thus it's never a hassle to find an empty seat. It is still accessible through the PATH by going through the First Canadian Place (FCP/BMO building), then making a right turn before you hit St. Andrew. The space is well lit with ample of natural light from the skylight and it's modern and well renovated.   The most popular dish here is their build-your-own bibimbaps, which you get a flower shaped sunny side up egg, then you pick your choice of meats (beef/chicken/fish/vegetarian), choice of rice (jasmine/brown/purple), and then choose from a huge variety of veggies. There is also the option to go for the default veggie pick as well. Or if you're really indecisive, you can also get their bulgogi on rice, which would only require you to pick your choice of rice. Each dish comes with a bowl of complementary miso soup.  I have tried both of their Bibimbap and Bulgogi and both are really good. The rice was well-cooked and the veggies were fresh. To get your money's worth it is recommended that you get the build your own Bibimbap and pick all your veggies, as opposed to opt for the default, as they tend to over-fill your bowl with ample amount of vegetable goodness :) However, for the flavour of the meats I tend to prefer the Bulgogi.   PS. There is a stamp card that rewards you a free meal for every 10 purchases."}
{"text":"A new addition to the PATH food courts, and a fairly decent one at that. $8 buys you a bowl of Bi Bim Bap, with a meat topping of your choice, a fried egg, and vegetables. You pick the sauce and they mix it in front of you. Portion sizes are decent, and lately, the rice bowls have started coming with free miso soup - which isn't groundbreaking, but is nice nevertheless.  This place also sells sushi, but pricing is exorbitant - as you'd expect in the financial district. Stick to the Korean fare.  The spice level isn't toned down much - so be careful if you order hot!"}
