{"text":"We arrived shortly after it opened, very crowded...We got seated, then headed to the buffet line...Lots of food to choose from. I have to honestly say, I tried almost everything. Can't complain about food, it's all you can eat. But there is a sign, stating to take food only what you can consume. Overall experience..6 out of 10."}
{"text":"Stopped here with the family after a hectic traffic drive. Food was okay some of it was a little bit watery and taste less. Giving it 3 stars b/c they seated my family and I quickly and the coffee cake was great. The employees were polite. Wouldn't come here again however."}
{"text":"In terms of cost, this buffet is extremely affordable with decent food variety and quality. On a Friday, they charged about $12.50 per adult. The dinner included sushi, some seafood, and usual Asian buffet classics."}
{"text":"Food is good but no privacy, seating very close to other people and service sucks wait staff not friendly at all I too cause it's the right thing to do but service definitely not worth it!"}
{"text":"Pretty nice selection for vegans (like me) and meat eaters alike. Everything looked fresh. The main problem I had was that I was wanting some sushi, but not one kind was fully veggie. All seemed to have some type of fish or imitation crab. Bummed. Price was pretty good for the selection."}
