{"text":"My wife and I have been here a few times. In have had the cheeseburger , fajitas and the buffalo chicken fingers (separate visits!).   The chicken fingers were very good but found that most other foods we have tried here are quite 'bland'.   The staff have been very good on all visits. Also nice to have a patio in oak ridges.   We don't go back unless it's for a few drinks."}
{"text":"Average burger. There are much better options in the area, if that's what you fancy. Asked about their pizza and was told the oven wasn't hot enough. Kids pizza was a pita covered in sauce and cheese. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for a late lunch on a cold Saturday afternoon. Very nice. Warm and cozy decor. Very good service too. Sat in the bar area. Good beer selection. Had a Granville Island. My wife had a Mill Street. Both frosty cold. We split the warm goat cheese salad for an appetizer. Delicious. The dressing is perfect, but what sets the salad apart is the fried goat cheese. It's warm, crispy and so rich. We also split our entrees. The buffalo chicken wrap and the pulled pork sandwich with fries. The wrap is quite spicy, with a ton of cheese and other fresh ingredients. It was pretty large, and very tasty. The pulled pork is excellent. A good sized portion too. A little spicy and sweet. Definitely in my top 10. Finally, I need to mention the fries. Normally they're treated like filler, just taking up room on the plate. Now we did get a ton, but these were super. Good chip truck quality. Would like to see them featured more on the menu. Maybe some poutines? Perhaps one using the pulled pork. Now that would be amazing. Very good experience. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Went for a Birthday Saturday night with friends.  Wow!  I've lived in Oak Ridges for 15 years and this is as good as it gets!  We were greeted graciously, our Waitress was fantastic and the Hostess (owner?) treated us like family.  The food by all accounts was delicious!  I have to say the Souvlaki was better than anything I've had on the Danforth; not that I've ever been disappointed on the Danforth. Has a casual family feel, the food choices and preparation push it far beyond the popular Roadhouse chains. I will be a regular!"}
{"text":"I've been here a bunch of times and every time I'm impressed! We've had lots of stuff on the menu and it's all good. The serving sizes are huge! Great place"}
{"text":"So...... It is closed and forever gone. Thanks k bye. I'm going to miss the best bruschetta and pasta"}
{"text":"When the folks come to visit from Woodstock I always feel like I have to impress them by taking them somewhere they've never been.  This may not seem like a very big job, but when my mother is involved it is. My mother is a picky, and slightly stubborn, English woman who went to culinary school in England. Right!?  When it involves my mother, any food recommendation requires research and reassurance.  Thank goodness for Yelp, because it brought me to Georgy Porgy.   I was psyched when I saw the online menu. It was actually readable and it provided prices. I hate when places don't advertise their prices. You never know what you've got yourself into until you sit down and start reading.  I always find online menus helpful when you are planning to dine with a picky eater. It definitely helped make my decision.    When I called my parents to tell them I was making reservations my mother said, \"Do they have decent beer?\"  (I'm so my mother's daughter) and my Dad asked \"Is it expensive? Cause Daddy's skint!\" (skint, meaning \"broke\", they were on their way back from Christmas shopping).    The place seemed more posh than I expected. All of us were in jeans but we soon realized it was a more relaxed atmosphere then we thought. The waitresses were wearing Lulu Lemon. Jealous!   The bar was impressive. It would be a great place for a party, especially a Christmas party with the dim lighting. It had loads of room and lots of booths! Everyone wants a comfy booth spot.  I'm a booth girl but, when it's one of those half booth half stool tables I always give up the comfy side to the person I'm with. Yeah, I'm nice that way. They just don't know I regret it every time.    When it came to ordering a beer I decided to try a pint of Granville Island. Never had it before but I was happy with it. It's almost like a darker Creemore. Mom and Dad got the usual Guinness and Rickards Red, both great beers!  For dinner we all ordered sandwiches. Partly due to that fact that we were all starved and lazy and sandwiches are super satisfying without all the work of an entr√©e. Oink.  I got the California Burger with Sweet Potato fries, the burger came with cheese, bacon, guacamole, lettuce, tomato, red onion and came on an onion bun...heck yes, nice touch! Mom got the Pulled Pork Sandwich and Dad got the Buffalo Chicken Wrap.  The food came promptly and hot.  Perfect.  As for the service, the staff was friendly, although they weren't very attentive. The hostess had the personality of a fence post and our waitress did not abide by the two bite rule. These things I can get over, for the most part.    Overall the dining experience was a good one.  I was happy, of course, beef and beer! Mom was impressed and Dad's forehead vein did not make a presence when the bill came."}
{"text":"This location which was the former home of Oregano North and Senor Frogs (Yes I've been living and loving in the Oaks for a long assed time now folks) has finally found a restaurant style fit for the community it serves.   To describe this space I would call it fine dining decore mixed with a Jack Astors twist, meaning its got a polished look to it but doesn't take itself too seriously. Staff are relatively new but are eager to please and more than friendly! This place is massive inside, restaurant seating aside it has a massive Bar area good enough for any sized group likely up to 50-75 people. They also have what appears to be a dance floor next to the bar which is being occupied by dining tables. But all that pales next to the heat emanating from.....A Full Wood Burning Pizza Oven...BOOM!!! How ya like Georgy Porgry now!  Having to wait for a seat in the small town of Oak Ridges home to such celebrities as.... well I think I'm kinda cool, so ME! Is something unheard of and actually a little welcome. I think a small line up at the door means that locals are choosing to dine and drink a stones throw (or short stumble) from their homes here as opposed to driving a town north to Aurora or south to Richmond Hill, Vaughan or Toronto. YAY!!!  A short wait later we were seated and presented with the menu...Holy Canadian CORNUCOPIA YelpMan!! Thats right, a menu as culturally diverse and eclectic as our country and more specifically our fine GTA. They literally have something for every cultural taste: Curry's, Stir fry, BBQ, Burgers, Ribs (which looked like something out of those old episodes of The Flintstones) Salads, grilled fish... everything really!  Starting off with drinks they had an average selection of beers on tap, my bro opted for Creemore Cream ale and I had my fav west coast brew Granville Island PA. Our party decided on: Steak Fajitas, A Cobb Salad and the clear winner of the evening The Pulled Pork Sandwich.   Fajitas were standard fare served sizzling on a skillet but I really enjoyed how much more colour was on the skillet (veggies and such) and it was piled high! Also they didn't skimp on the toppings!   Cobb Salad - Chicken on top was cooked perfectly and toppings were fresh. only draw back was thick mystery dressing served in a plastic container. It was thick and was hard to mix with the full salad bowl - maybe asked for the salad to be tossed in dressing.  Pullled Pork - HUGE!!! So big and saucy that my own bottomless pit brother could only finish 1/2. Topped with mushrooms and sauteed onions....maybe even Bacon? That would be just silly, but maybe! Served with enough fries to serve a party of 4 - great value 11.99! Holy EFF!!!  Dessert then followed and we decided to share in a slice of chocolatey heaven which bore the name \"Chocolate Confusion\"....(seriously that was the dishes name). I can see the confusion as I didn't know which of the 8 different kinds of chocolate I was eating at any given time.   Overall I'd say a great 3.5 star experience but certainly a great place to now come for drinks before stumbling home  (FINALLY I CAN STUMBLE HOME FROM SOMEWHERE)....Whatever will I wear?!?!!? For that you get a bonus 1/2.  Next time I am in, the side of hog known as the rib dinner - is mine!!!  END NOTE: HUGE PATIO!!!! Ready for next Summer already!!!"}
{"text":"Definitely exceeded expectations! I had the French Dip.. Very tasty!! The pastas were on special and we ordered the carbonara which was outstanding.. Not heavy at all, pasta perfectly cooked, lots of bacon .. It was really good.. My boy had the burger which based on the shape of the patty had to be frozen but it was still pretty tasty. House wine on special for $4.50 a glass.. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I have visited this location 5 times over the last two months, and I'll continue to do so!  The half price wings on Monday is a great deal.. BIG wings!  Their basket of fries is rather large.. More than enough for two people.  But what really makes this place great is the service.  My daughter and I have been served by different staff each time, and they've all been wonderful!    Can't wait till next Monday!"}
{"text":"Normally if I'm thinking about somewhere to eat, Oak Ridges in Richmond Hill would be the LAST place I would think of. The area seems to be a hotbed for rednecks and all-day breakfast joints.  This is what makes Georgy Porgy a nice surprise. I lIke going here with my family for casual dinner when we feel like being a bit naughty on the nutrition front. We also like to support local small business owners and I believe this restaurant is just that.  The portion sizes are huge, so be prepared. The meals I like best are their souvlaki dinners (HUGE), Friday night pizza from a real wood burning oven and their burgers. My less favourite are their liver and onions (I had it twice and don't think the liver was fresh) and their ribs (good sauce, but dry when I had them).  My kids order deep fried calamari nearly everywhere we go and Georgy Porgy probably does it the best. Always tender and crispy. Get it with their Tzatziki!!!  The service here is consistently friendly, but often slow, even when there are very few customers in the restaurant. We never go to restaurants when in a hurry and the servers are usually really nice, so this helps ease that pain. I met the lady who was either the manager or the owner and she was really lovely; enthusiastic and welcoming.   There are TVs positioned around the restaurant so it's easy to watch baseball, hockey etc. The bar area is large and looks like a good place to go for a pint or two...they even have Granville beer which is one of my faves.  Pros:  Good food Great value Huge portions Fair prices Friendly staff Good for families Wood burning pizza oven  Pre-order take-out online  Cons:  Location - in the No Frills parking lot...don't go faster than 10km or you'll lose an axel in the potholes and bumps! Atmosphere is a bit dated and dark Service is sometimes slow Very limited wine selection for a place that has such a huge bar  Overall excellent value and  a nice family dining experience."}
{"text":"I need to go back for the Souvlaki.  Those were the words on our lips when we looked over at the table next to ours and what they had ordered.  We ordered everything from steak to potato skins... to fajitas.   This is a very kid friendly place.  The wait staff and owner were friendly and very accommodating of our needs.  The food was well seasoned.  Everything tasted good.  Georgy Porgy's offers a variety of food everything from curry to fajitas to the aforementioned souvlaki.  For a restaurant with such a wide offering, the food they plate out is surprisingly tasty and consistently so.  So I am a fan."}
