{"text":"This might be, hands down, the worst food in pittsburgh. When I asked the gentleman who answered the phone how the food was he said: decent! I should've known then not to order, but I did anyways. Small pizza and Italian hoagie just to \"test\" quality.... I almost puked after first bite of pizza, and Italian hoagie was smothered in mayo! Mayo on italian hoagie with no Italian dressing??? Please save yourselves the stomach pains and order somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! They have a very unique sauce that is a little sweet. Defiantly worth a try and is one of my favorites. Their subs are pretty good too..."}
{"text":"Only ordered due to the entertainment book. The discount amount was good for the quality received. Staff is very blunt and unfriendly! All orders are to go/maybe delivery. Would never pay full price for this pie!"}
{"text":"I have ordered delivery from Speedies before, but I was hungry for some pizza after work and decided to swing by, check in, and see the homebase.  I do truly like the taste of their pizza compared to other places in the same area. To the spongey crisp crust, sweet tomato sauce and the right amount of cheese, I mean it's pizza, it's hard to capture the sizzle of the mouth in words.   They always have great prices and specials, I'd always check and call first to see what they are offering. There's no dining room in this place, there is however a very tiny waiting area, and when I say tiny, I mean like for two people at the most. The employees are obedient and friendly even when I have decided to pick up my order 15 minutes before their closing. They do accept credit cards, however they do charge a 6% (I think, or very close to) fee to your order for using one.   Overall, I'm glad I stopped in to see the home of where three deliveries come from."}
