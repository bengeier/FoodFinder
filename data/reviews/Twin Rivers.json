{"text":"I was really excited to experience the food at this place, although I dont think they should have opened so soon.   I also ordered a blackened mahi sandwich and my fries were not done. My mahi mahi was half the size of the bun and not very good either.  My mother and a friend ordered the roast beef sandwich with ah ju and it was bad for both of them! I am not sure ill try this place again but If I do I sure hope they have hired new cooks.  And I didn't get pickles"}
{"text":"Went for Sunday brunch, staff disorganized, stood in line 10 minutes for buffet. Food was luke warm at best. Wanted a good restaurant in Lake Wylie. Search continues."}
{"text":"I would have given it one star but the food wasn't that bad. I ordered the hot and sweet calamari app which had a nice flavor, my husband ordered the prime rib which was okay, nothing special, for the entree I had ordered the sushi grade tuna with a red wine demi-glaze, kitchen screwed up and sent me the grilled tuna with some sort of sauce, had to return it and waited and waited. ( the table behind us had 2 incorrect orders sent to them) Sushi grade tuna is supposed to be sliced thinly, this was a chunk of tuna, i didn't taste a demi-glaze, looked like a bit of brown sauce was thrown on top of it.  Now on to the service, we called a day before to book a reservation for 8pm Saturday, they told us to call one hour before, which we did.  When we got there at 8pm the hostess told us we had to wait, I told her we had a reservation, she had a glazed look on her face, she began to put us on a waiting list, I looked at the book and pointed to our reservation, which she had mistakenly put down for 7pm, we told her 3 times that they had told us to call one hour before to confirm, which we did, not sure why that was so difficult to get a reservation correct.  She then tried to sit us at a bar table.  I've never heard of having to reserve a bar table, whenever a customer doesn't want to wait the servers always recommend a bar table if available.  They got upset that we wanted a normal table, well, there was a 2 top by the aquarium but the very young and inexperienced server proceeded to sit us at a 4 top right outside the kitchen; we kindly asked to be moved right across and she gave us an attitude.  Good thing we moved since the server coming out of the kitchen forgot something and immediately turned around and spilled something over our server.  We did have a change in servers, which was the only thing keeping us there, I believe her name was Roxanne.  Not coming back here unless they change the entire kitchen staff and hostesses and most of the wait staff."}
{"text":"My wife was craving a burger and we decided to give this place a try. So sorry we did. The ambiance leaves a whole lot to be desired. They did absolutely NOTHING to the interior except remove all of the previous owners stuff from hanging on the walls. I have to admit it was the first time I had ever really SEEN the bar area. The last few time we were there under previous owners it was usually draped in a cover of nasty cigarette smoke. But, back to the food. We both ordered the burger plate. That came with fries. I asked the girl what kind of fries they were and she seemed dumbfounded. and then she said ummmm - steak fries?? I asked that they do their best to make them crispy and she obliged. They didn't bring ketchup, mustard, or mayo with the burger - had to ask - and wait on the waitress to deliver salad to another table before coming back to us.......The burgers were 'ok' - were they worth the 9 bucks they charged us? NO - Look at the pic to see how much lettuce I got on mine - my wife had the same amount so I can only imagine they ration them all this way. The burgers were small and the ciabatta crap bread they serve it on was nasty. My daughter ordered the Kid's fried chicken with 2 chocolate chip cookies for dessert turned out to be half a breast of chicken with one cookie.I really hate leaving a restaurant feeling totally unsatisfied with my meal - that's how I felt here...kind of like I was ripped off. I don't think we'll be going back and its a shame - it's so close to the house. I don't give them long.  on another note - my stomach has not wanted to cooperate with me all day today - it's taken me a while to figure out why - must have been my visit to this establishment last night...ugh!!!"}
{"text":"I've been anxiously awaiting the opening of this farm-to-table restaurant.  Lake Wylie desperately needs more dining options.  Although their official grand opening is August 24, they currently offer a limited To Go menu, for window pick-up.  The other day, I ordered their blackened mahi mahi sandwich, which was delicious!  It's served with a lime mayo and a side of fries and pickles. I think it was $9.  Well worth it.  Please check out what their regular menu will offer (link is in business info)."}
{"text":"We decided to give this place a chance and now we're regretting it.  First of all, the decor leaves a lot to be desired and the cheap, metal frame chairs with a thin layer of foam padding left my butt hurting halfway through dinner.   As an appetizer, we ordered the lump crab cakes.  There were 3 small cakes for $11.  I might not have thought they were bad if they were actually hot.  That's an understatement...they were cold. I ordered the grilled salmon and noticed that the waitress never asked me how I wanted it cooked.  Apparently the default is raw because that's what I got.  When I flagged down the waitress to tell her, she said that she would bring another one and didn't take my plate.  I thought this was an interesting move...like, now no one will see a plate going back to the kitchen.  Instead, she came back 2 minutes later and said that \"they\" wanted it.  A short time later, I was pleased to see that the plate came back with a new potato and more green beans (which were way over-seasoned with pepper) but...THE SAME PIECE OF SALMON.  They literally took my cut open piece of salmon that had my germ filled fork all over it, and put it back on the grill!  I find that disgusting. In the meantime, my husband had the scallops with sauted spinach.  He didn't have much to complain about until he found a random elbow macaroni underneath his spinach. Normally I get upset at my daughter when she doesn't eat, but I took a bite of the meatball she was supposed to be eating and gave her a pass. In the 2 hours since we've left, my daughter has been to the bathroom twice, my husband once and none of us have a good feeling in our bellies.  I think my pain is from the fact that we spent almost $100."}
{"text":"Salad, not enough dressing served to even matter.  Baked potato, served cold in center and hard as a rock.  Steak, fair  Service, ok til bill came. Computers still not working. Waitress couldn't add three simple numbers. We are still waiting on credit from our bank.   Bar area and bar service are only positives about this place."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try this restaurant in spite of the mostly negative reviews because it's close to our home and we wanted to at least try and support a new local business. Now, on to the review.... When we first walked in I was a bit surprised at how bland and dim the decor was. The walls were unadorned and gray and the tile floor was a bit slippery too. The table had a small battery operated fake candle which was quite cheesy.  Our server was very attentive and did a very good job for us. The menu was a bit confusing as your choice is either a $20 steak or seafood entree or a $10 sandwich or burger. I was thinking that something in the middle would have been nice to have on the menu so I considered my choices quite limited.  I opted for the Reuben and my wife chose the French dip. Our food arrived in a timely manner and the sandwiches were very good and served with fresh cut fries. The fries were a bit bland but they were hot and fresh.  Overall, it was okay. I would be more likely to return if there were dinner choices other than sandwiches for under $20. For me, the menu just doesn't match the \"feel\" of the restaurant."}
{"text":"We had high hopes for this place when we saw it was going to be a new restaurant. looks fantastic from the outside, the interior looks more like a cafe/ bar/diner, and leans hard to looking like a fish camp. We expected nice comfy booths and great ambiance, what we got was diner tables and chairs (no booths at all) no wall hangings or themes other than a wrong color blue walls, crazy, easy to get lost closed floor plan. We expected a mid to high end dining experience and with the menu prices you  would expect it too.... unfortunately the food was high priced and low quality. The thousand Island dressing was the worst ive ever had, I didnt know you could make bad dressing but it has happened. the prime rib was obviously vac pack single serve steak, not an in house cooked slab of prime rib beef, sorry to say. The blackened steak was smothered in blue cheese, we all know how strong blue cheese is and it should not cover the whole steak for sure. The creamy horseradish dip was weak with no hint of kick. A nice piece of ciabatta bread at the beginning of the meal is a nice touch but was cold and dry. I really would like to see this place succeed but it will take some major changes to turn this place around, or my guess would be it will be a 1 year wonder like most new start ups. If Twin Rivers reads this, please take this as constructive and place quality above all and turn this place around, its a great location and has great potential. good luck"}
{"text":"I was anxiously awaiting the time I could go and I wish I would have waited.  A co worker and I went here for lunch and it was just okay.   First arrived and it seems there was really nothing done to the inside and smelled if old river rat and tbones Combo. (The old restaurant it used to be and the one down by the lake that also has poor reviews.).  So we sat down and the menu is on a cutout bubble jet printer nothing fancy. The waitress didn't have a clue about anything on the menu and after we decided on the mahi she mentioned they didn't have mahi.  Jeez.  So she mentioned swordfish which was not on the menu and a side of fruit.  Came in a reasonable amount of time and it better have because it was it the darn thing was only about the size of sliced tomato and the thickness of a sheet of paper.  The bun, shredded lettuce and fruit all looked like it was carefully selected from bi-lo grocery down the street.   Next thing I know the bill is there.   We had to say thanks on the way out and there was a total of about 8 people there for lunch.   Very disappointed and will definitely not be going there for at least a couple months since its obvious nothing was really ready.  I sure hope the owners are reading this.   I guess it's back to fort mill and Charlotte for quality.   Try terrace cafe in South Park for lunch it's amazing and service is incredible for about the same price."}
{"text":"Just curious why these girls are using this site to post their personal photo sessions thought photos were for food and the restaurant.   Got a to go menu.  Won't go until reviews improve."}
{"text":"Food is OK but the atmosphere sucks. Dim with fake candles at lunch time? Seriously? As soon as we walk in the host asked if we wanted to sit at the bar. We said no and she asked why. WTF? The burger is good but, if you decide to try this place after reading this review, I suggest ordering the fries without seasoning so you might get some that aren't cold, stale, and WAY over-seasoned."}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday with family and I was highly disappointed.  The River Rat was so much better on many levels.  The food was not great at all (the blackened oysters were a joke!) and the prices are expensive for the poor quality of food they served.  The waitress spilled some of my mixed drink on me and didn't even offer me a new drink or for that matter, clean it up.  It didn't seem like the people who worked there were well trained either.  To top it off, we waited around an hour outside hoping it would be worth the wait.  And when you have a 2 y/o, that is not a fun experience.  It is such a shame the River Rat turned into this.. I would not recommend this place unless they did a complete overhaul on food quality and management."}
{"text":"We ate here last weekend.  Think it was the first weekend open for full menu. Portions were SMALL, is an understatement .  Food quality was good, better than others in the area, however really small.  I had the swordfish and I doubt it was more than 4 oz, about 1/4 inch thick.  I think it was $18.  Also had a salad, very small as well and I think $10.  If you consider the portion size, I think the prices are outrageous.  We will Try it one more time as it was good and the area needs quality like this, but if the portions are this small again this will be last."}
{"text":"I don't understand all the negative reviews, I was very impressed with my visit. The staff was responsive and friendly, food was great, and reasonably priced. The crab cakes were the best appetizer. The pork chops was my entrée and I was more than impressed. Overall, this is an excellent local restaurant that apparently had some grand opening issues, but they have overcome them. I would definitely recommend Twin Rivers!"}
{"text":"I should have written this review a while back.  A group of us went here on a Saturday afternoon after a youth football game.  The atmosphere was .... Blah.... No better word for it.  They had those fake candles on the table.  Getting past that... I really don't want to spend a lot of time on this review.  The food was sub par and the wait staff was not well trained.  It's a real shame ass I am guessing the owners put a lot of money into this place.  They should have had someone help them they knew the business better.  I drove by on January 8, 2014 and there is a For Lease sign out front.  I guess they went under.  Unfortunately, not a surprise."}
