{"text":"After reading the reviews made, this doesn't seem to be a good restaurant. However, I decided to give it a try anyway, since I always tend to try lots of asian restaurants.   My first impression after entering the resto: I really like the atmosphere.. it's so asian like: we don't see on chairs like other resto, and we have to get our shoes off at the entrance. Not only the decoration was really good, the food was excellent!   Brief, the dinner was really memorable, and you get what you pay.. Will definitely come again :)"}
{"text":"Very quaint and typical decor however in Montreal today you really need to step up your game when serving sushi...  Not bad- not great.  Service is good- kid friendly.  Tempura was really very good as was the miso soup.  But we were there for the sushi and as you may have read in the other reviews could really use a little update.  The only reason I can't give it more than 2 stars is that there are so many very good sushi restaurants in Montreal why have average."}
{"text":"This place has a great ambience which is why it gets a couple stars from me. Tables on ground, comfortable cushions, nice music, East Asian books to flip through, and nice decor. However the sushi here is very run of the mill. The rice is packed too tight, and the flavours are all over the place - sometimes good but other times very odd. I actually felt as though I was eating tuna from a can in some of the rolls. The kimchi on the other hand was excellent, which makes me wonder if this place has a Korean chef, and maybe that side of their menu is better. It was also strange that the waitress brought a closed bottle of wine to the table and didn't open or serve it. It was a twist cap, but I was surprised not to get the usual opening and testing ritual. Maybe because they normally serve sake? I don't know."}
{"text":"J'ai longtemps hésité avant de savoir si j'allais mettre 3 ou 4 étoiles. Mais rien que le restaurant, le lieu, vaut le détour ! D'où 4 :) En arrière de l'Avenue Mont-Royal, il faut vraiment vouloir aller au Bleu Caramel pour le trouver. En entrant, la serveuse nous a demandé d'enlever nos chaussures et nos vestes. Puis on s'est assis par terre, sur des tapis de paille, avec des coussins et notre petite table basse, en face d'un immense aquarium... on est déjà dans l'ambiance avant même d'avoir ouvert le menu !! Pour ce qui est du repas, les coups de coeur de la carte on vraiment été une découverte !! Des makis comme fris, chaud dehors, froid dedans... un régal !!! Mais déçue par le plateau qui suivait, où il n'y avait pas de poisson ! Des makis au surimi, crevette et légumes, décevant. Conclusion : y aller pour la déco/l'ambiance, et les coups de coeur de la carte"}
{"text":"Nous avons été visités l'endroit avec ma soeur et la famille (2 enfants, 13/8 ans). Les enfants ont bien aimé, les sushis étaient délicieux, et avec le coupon, le prix était mieux que juste. On était un peu coincé par contre, mais sinon, c'est un très bon restaurant. L'on compte y retourner bientôt sans les enfants question d'avoir plus d'espace!"}
{"text":"Hard to find any fault with the restaurant or the experience.  Our waiter contributed substantially to our pleasant evening.  The miso soup was one of the best I have had and the rest of the meal was creative, tasty and well presented.  I would have preferred a larger selection of sake... But the one we had was reasonable and tasty.  A great dinner experience.  I love Montreal."}
{"text":"Après avoir eu 2 recommandations nous nous aventurons ce soir dans au Bleu Caramel et nous ne sommes pas déçu.  En entrée les raviolis de boeuf et de crevettes sont à notre gout en attendant nos sushis. Justement le plateau de sushi arrive et nous apprécions nos 24 pièces comme il se doit. Les sushis/surimis sont frais et fabriqués sans conservateur. Les goûts sont présents et on sent qu'il ne s'agit pas de vulgaires sushis comme on peut en trouver à la pelle à Montréal. Ils sont recherchés et cela se retrouve dans notre sourire en les mangeant !  Le seul petit bémol est le dessert (crème glacé au thé) qui n'est pas à notre gout mais nous étions venus avant tout pour les sushis donc   Nous en ressortons donc clairement conquis et sommes sur de revenir à notre prochaine envie de sushi :)"}
{"text":"The ambience is exotic & inviting. Family run with kindness, it's a vacation from the hubbub of bustling Mont-Royal. However, the menu could use an update as it was average. Until then, I'd go back for tea."}
{"text":"My airbnb host recommended Bleu Caramel when my friend was craving sushi, and it turned out to be the perfect ending to an already great day (and our last night) in Montreal.  Taking Marien's (the owner, I believe?) recommendation, my two friends and I shared the Fujiyama platter (a 24 piece assortment of maki and nigiri), the JMDTT maki, the Manman maki, and they split a bottle of sake. Our order came with miso soup, and that just really hit the spot on a rainy Saturday night. When Marien brought out the Manman maki, he explained there was to be no soy sauce or wasabi for that roll, just the sauce on the plate. My friend loved that they were going for authenticity. We agreed we've had better sushi, and it was on the pricey side, but we definitely enjoyed ourselves. What really made our experience so enjoyable was the ambiance. We sat on the floor with our shoes off (there are two tables with seats on one side of the restaurant, but that's no fun! one of my friends is 6'5\" and he was fine sitting on the floor), basked in mood lighting. A couple was on a date in one corner, friends catching up at the tables behind us and to our left, and a group of what looked like coworkers having a meal together sat at one of the tables with seating. We were all tucked inside this sushi restaurant, so unassuming that you'd miss it if you weren't looking for it. It was raining on and off outside but I felt like we were in our own world inside Bleu Caramel. It was so chill.  Our host had recommended Bleu Caramel especially because she really loved the service there, and I'm going to echo the same sentiment. My friend and I had actually shown up at Bleu Caramel the night before we actually dined there. It was around 10:15 and Marien met us at the door and informed us that the kitchen was closed. He explained that most restaurants in the area closed their kitchens around 10. We understood and thanked him, ready to head out. But before we went, Marien recommended a restaurant in the area with good food that would still be open at that time. I took my phone out to jot the name down and he did us one better and gave us walking directions on how to get there. We made sure to return to Bleu Caramel the next night, well before 10pm. Marien was, again, so nice to us during our meal. We made small talk and he asked us our names at one point and when we left like 2 hours(!) later, he addressed each of us by our names in his farewell.  After reading the review about their excellent kimchi, I'm definitely going to have to order it when I stop by Bleu Caramel the next time I'm in Montreal. And I'll be sure to do some google translating of the menu before I go. ;)"}
{"text":"Went here to blue Caramel with four people we had two coupons that I paid $39 each for.  Per couple was it fixed dinner we received an appetizer of at edamame- a warm mixed fish sushi roll- and a 24 piece mixed sushi roll.  We ordered two beers one sake and one glass of wine.  The table seating is on the floor with your legs crossed there is no where to put your legs so if you're sitting there for an hour or you're going to get cramped up. The food was okay but coming from New York City I'm used to nice fresh large pieces of fish.  We were served some sort of weird lake tilapia that taste it is though it was previously frozen. The old man who waited on us was a little odd and he did not speak English-  After dinner we received some sort of chocolate covered fruit in an ice bowl.  I couldn't really identify the fruit because it was tasteless.  Although the chocolate was good. Afterwards when I went to pay the remainder of the tab which includes tax and the drinks I was given a bill for approximately $100.  Now remember I have already prepaid for the dinners.  So were two beers one glass of wine and one Sacchi plus tax we were charged $100.   If you include the price I paid for the Groupon it was $160 for dinner which mostly consisted of some rice.   Go there at your own risk,"}
