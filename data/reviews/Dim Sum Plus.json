{"text":"There are better places in the area. Some dim sum dish descriptions were inaccurate and the egg tarts were dry."}
{"text":"Another all day dim sum place opened up in Chinatown. It's neither better or worse than the other dim sum restaurants in the neighbourhood. This is just another alternate to go to when your usual dim sum joint is too busy. If you happen to be sitting by the window up top, servers may forget about you as they mainly focus on patrons on the main floor. So far this place is relatively new and not as noisy and hectic. It'll be interesting to see if they'll endure and become a fixture."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner to wrap up our day in Toronto. The fact that it's a brand new restaurant right in the middle of Chinatown with a shiny and modern decor attracted us. The service here seemed a little hectic even though there weren't that many diners in the restaurant but overall they were nice. I would say the food was good but not particularly memorable. You can definitely pick a random Cantonese restaurant in NYC and do much better for a fraction of the price. Of note, I particularly enjoyed the mapo tofu and lobster braised noodles."}
{"text":"I truly don't understand the low ratings from the other two reviews because my experience was pretty great!

I'm aware that they recently opened, and they were having a grand opening special of 10% off your bill. However, it's cash only (the promotion only - they do accept debit/credit for payment but you can't get the discount). For seven dim sum dishes on a Tuesday afternoon, my bill came up to be around $29 (paid with debit, before tip), which is pretty cheap for dim sum.

I was seated on the upper window floor with my mom and at first, we were quite worried that they would forget us since we were the only ones up there. However, throughout our lunch, a server came every 5 minutes to check up on us, sometimes even just walking over to our table and smiling awkwardly when they realize that we didn't need anything from them lol. This was especially great for my mom, whose a bit impatient with slow restaurant service. 

My favorite dishes were the siu mai and the chicken feet + spare ribs rice combo. The siu mai are huge and juicy, while the rice combo was large enough for my mom and I to split. They are all made fresh to order and I found nothing wrong with any of the dishes we chose. 

My impatient, picky eating mom loved the chicken feet and now raves this restaurant - and so do I!"}
{"text":"We went to Dim Sum Plus restaurant for Mother's day lunch. The restaurant is recently opened and is nicely decorated. The restaurant wasn't very crowded when we got there, but it eventually filled up. The service was fine.

Dim Sum Plus didn't have the cart service, but we ordered our dishes from a menu. Unlike a cart service, the dishes were hot since they are prepared for us, but some of the dishes were not properly cooked. For example, the rice in bamboo leaves dish were under cooked. Also, they forgot some of our dishes and we have to remind them after waiting a few minutes.

It came to $72 for the four of us. Would we go back? There isn't that many dim sum restaurants in the Chinatown area so we might go back."}
