{"text":"Was a moderately busy night. Me and my girlfriend got seated near the bar. After 10 minutes of sitting we finally get a menu, another 13 minutes until the waitress asks what we want. Food came rather quickly and the whole night we were not offered any drinks. So we drank the default water. Wasn't a pleasant night or service. The food was ok"}
{"text":"We sat near the bar area and was served right away our drinks A+.
 However, a waitress asked us if we wanted to order food- yes and she said she would be right back with menus. 
We waited one hour, while the bar tender kept bringing our drinks while we waited and waited and finally decided not to order food at all.
The bar tender (after 3x of asking us if our orders were taken, mind you no menu still). The waitress walked by us several times ignoring us....
This wasnt game night. 
This wasnt a busy night period.
We were 3 people...FINALLY she showed up \"oh, did you want anything?\" Took a lot of nerve on my behalf bot to chew her over, \"yes, 2hrs and 15mins ago would have been nice.\"
\"Well what about fries?\" No thanks, we're about just leaving.

We did not get an apology, no compensation and when i asked for her name she rolled her eyes.
NEVER AGAIN"}
{"text":"On Thursday mornings it's all you can eat roast beef from 11:00AM until 3:00PM. After having had a taste, I knew I had to make time to come back and try it.

This time the place was busy, the waitresses were attentive and everybody was at the top of their game. After being seated, I got in line and tried out their buffet.

With an entree of chef's salad or soup, the buffet has roast veggies, baked potatoes and creamy mashed potatoes, but then we get on to the meat of the subject: generous portions of tender roast beef cooked and seasoned to perfection, rare, medium (more flavorful I find) or well done with a choice of pepper sauce (more like a gravy with black peppers in it) or portolaise (port wine sauce).

Definitely worth the visit."}
{"text":"Not a bad spot to grab a quick bite or even chill out and watch the game.
Plenty of waitress working so service is okay.
Good burgers and friendly staff.

Love grabbing a beer here they have a good selection and it's always cold. A lot better than driving downtown to find a fancy spot."}
{"text":"I actually like this place.     Sure, it's a brasserie so don't expect white glove service, but it doesn't pretend to be anything other than it is.....a comfortable local bar with great breakfast, a dance floor and a stage for a band.     
Service is friendly, meals are affordable.    It's a great place for a laid back family or work gathering."}
{"text":"Went there  for a Christmas lunch with friends and Highly enjoyed the food. Have been back a few times and everytime enjoyed myself and the food.  Not too expensive."}
{"text":"Nice and big terasse outside, good for the summer. First time i went I got fish n chips which were actually really good. My favourite are the chicken wings, which I've had a couple times and always enjoyed. Definitely want to go back for a drink on the terasse soon!"}
{"text":"We went here hoping to find some decent food, but were greatly disappointed! The menu is very diverse, but I think that this is why the chef is not really an expert at making anything. The food is bland at best. The beer is ok. Overall, way too expensive for what it is. We ended up spending $70 for 2 people. The meal itself was worth maybe $25. I tried it, but never again. Ok if you're starving or your tastebuds don't work"}
{"text":"C'est ma première visite à ce bar sportif et je ne sais pas trop à quoi m'attendre. 
Le décor est celui d'un bar sportif avec des télés partout et un decor tout en sport. Je me dit qu'habituellement, la nourriture d'une brasserie est bonne et généreuse. Une table d'hôte a prix raisonnable est disponible mais j'ai vu en entrant un spécial burger qui m'a ouvert l'appétit. En effet le hamburger etait délicieux. Je dois dire que c'est un des meilleurs burger que j'ai mangé.  Oui, le burger etait fait maison avec une viande hachée fraiche. Avec le fromage et le portobello c'était parfait. Les frites maison étaient aussi délicieuse.  Ma compagne de table a opté pour le Poutine a la viande fumée et elle etait comblée. J'ai été aussi agréablement surpris que cette brasserie au lieu de servir les vins au verre Auberge et Jouvance, sert des vins très potables. Bravo a eux. Pour le service ce fut parfait. Notre serveuse Lizette a pris soins que nous manquions de rien . Son service etait amical et professionnel. J'y retourne bientôt, probablement un. Soir de match du CH pour voir l'ambiance."}
{"text":"Yahhhhh go if other people want to...but otherwise find somewhere betta!

Booze: relatively expensive compared to most places in the sud-ouest. (9$ for a smirnoff ice, 28$ for a pitcher of sangria, didn't catch the beer prices but even their 5@7 prices were at best ok (a double cocktail for 7$ only from 5-8).

Atmosphere/Ambiance: ...meh ok. It's all cute ladies serving the tables, so that's pleasant and they mostly seem to be quite nice and efficient. It's a general sports bar feel to this place, equipped with TVs and terrace and plenty of tables so pretty decent for groups especially. Age range seemed to be from 18+. 

Music: the satellite radio they were playing at the beginning of the night was spot on with lots of popular summer-y tunes makin us all wiggle with delight in our seats as we sang along to some songs.... And then the DJ started. Wow did that ever suck. For about an hour he played 70's music which was hit or miss (sweet home alabama = hit; 3X acdc songs practically back to back = miss!) ...and then outta nowhere it was 50 cent and other various similar songs which made everyone who was dancing sit down lol. 

So yah overall pricey, generic sports bar with sometimes good music and cute ladies serving u. I'll only come back whenever my friends and colleagues want to, it certainly won't be my first choice."}
{"text":"On aime ça la \"BDR\"!!! Pour l'ambiance, le service, la proximité de la maison... mais surtout la bouffe! Je commence ma découverte du menu, mais à date, tout ce que j'ai mangé était délicieux et très abordable.

Je compte bien m'y trouver quand le CH fera les series (optimiste ;-P)"}
{"text":"i arrived to the bar,i ordered a buck of bud...waiteed.... looked at the barmaid to remind her... she looked at me... i waited... the buck never came.... an hour later she came with the buck.... (i didnt take it) thank u for the good service (not really).... very bad experience atleast im with my friend.... i would have rated zero."}
{"text":"Located in the renovated Place LaSalle mall we decided to try out this brasserie for a quick lunch. Place was pretty quiet for lunch say for the few usual suspects. Was greeted right away and told to sit anywhere we wanted. Our friendly waitress gave us our menus to look over.

Waitress comes back and takes our order. It took about 20 minutes or so to get our order. My wife ordered the club salad which is basically a salad with the club sandwich ingredients minus the bread and fries. She truly enjoyed it. Well presented, fresh spinach, bacon done right, and a great little sauce on the side. I had the regular club sandwich which was ok, nothing earth shattering.

Service was very friendly, but we suspect that maybe it was our waitress first day. She was super friendly, but almost poured water into our drinks (lol) and seemed to forgot to ask us if we wanted anything else. She also was slightly overwhelmed at the few tables she was waiting on. She apologized for the delay in getting our check and thanked us for our patience. 

We enjoyed it enough that we will try it again, this time for supper."}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of my favourite restaurants in Montreal. The supper menu is excellent, so much so that I can't pick one single meal that I like the most. For starters they have amazing hamburgers, my personal favourite however is the Southern Comfort burger-it's so delicious. Their fish and chips, pulled pork sandwich, poutine, lobster ( in June), and breakfast foods are also other meals they offer that are delicious."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place and tried hard, but.... it was awful. I went with my girlfriend looking for a quick Brasserie style meal and a beer.
They do have a great choice of beers but it ends there.
My girlfriend ordered a vegetarian burger - not a good choice - we weren't sure what it was but it really wasn't edible. 
I went with what should be standard fare for  Brasserie in Montreal - the classic Hamburger steak and onions - not sure how but they managed to mess this up also. The meat was way over cooked and dry as cardboard, the few onions that came with it were barely cooked, but the worst part was the gravy. The gravy was basically (or at least tasted like it) BBQ chicken gravy - awful!!
Maybe we got a bad night ( Thursday at 7:00) but don't think we will be going back."}
{"text":"Brasserie des Rapides is better than your local sports bar, but lacks the authenticity of Irish pubs that I oh-so love. It's a French-Canadian resto-bar with big TVs, a big menu and a handful of cute \"modern\" features thrown in, such as free charging stations for your phone, a stage for events (they host a lot of seasonal events that usually include a special menu or nicely priced deals on their standard menu) that hold a dj booth and space for karaoke, ... It's cute, and you can tell that they invested a lot of money into it to make it a focal point of the otherwise lack-luster \"strip mall\" (is that what its considered to be?) on Champlain. 

The best part about BDR is the food. Very big selection, with original menu items that you likely won't see in other pubs of the same genre. I especially love their burgers, but I would recommend anything on the menu that showcases meat since they seem to specialize in it (I used to do my shopping in the area and I could smell meat being smoked, roasted, ... from their kitchen when passing by, the aromas were really amazing). The portions are really generous, I usually end up taking food home. It can be a bit pricey for a resto-bar, but I feel like I'm getting my money's worth.

As for the drinks, the prices really aren't anything special, but I would recommend getting a pint or a pitcher of their home-brew, it's quite nice and a cheaper option. I haven't enjoyed any of their cocktails though, I'll stick to speciality bars for those lol

Overall, its a really nice resto-bar! If you're in the area and looking for food with a Canadian flair, I would recommend BDR :)"}
