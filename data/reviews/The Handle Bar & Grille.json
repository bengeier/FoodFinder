{"text":"The Black Friday is to die for. Owners are cool. All homemade and close to home. Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Went here for wing night (50 cent wings and 2 dollar yuengs). The wings were good, however the service was very slow! Didn't seem like a busy night either. Was surprised since everything ordered was deep fried and quick to make."}
{"text":"Very good. Will return. Owner and bartender both very friendly. steak tacos $9 and chicken quesadilla $8.  Fresh."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in the area with entertainment, great food and the best ever curly fries. Unfortunately they closed with no notice and the place is now for sale"}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Not an assortment of fried bar foods.  Daily specials are always a good bet.  Fresh ingredients makes a big difference.   Four or five brews on tap and full liquor assortment."}
{"text":"Great non smoking bar. Had three big drafts for about 10$. Wings are good, had medium hot buffalo and they were HOT! Beer specials during Pens games. Great staff. Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great environment, great staff, and great food! Pleasant bar guests to visit with, good live music on weekends, and the owners are very interactive with the customers and makes us feel at home. Def be pushing as many people as possible to check it out, won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this place. Regular stop for dinner or drinks. Menu is on smaller side, which isn't a bad thing. What they make they make very well. Burgers, salads, soups are all outstanding. Fun atmosphere, friendly attentive service. Great prices. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Dined here Friday 1/18/13 and was impressed. Simple menu, but big on taste. Had the choriso won tons, steak tacos, and bacon cheese burger. Service was good, too. Wish I could give 4.5 stars. The missing 0.5 star is for the small menu."}
{"text":"Recently remodeled andreopened from what we were told.  Visiting a friend here, not a local.  EXCELLENT food!  Everything we ordered was top notch: black and bleu sliders (my fave), potato skins, chorizo wontons, wings, stuffed poblano peppers.  Met the chef; he gave us tastings of his cream of mushroom soup--also superb!  Wish we lived in town.  Will definitely eat there again next time in town.  Service was quick; bartender friendly and helpful--knew the menu well.  Go check them out!  AND--the owner is a MARINE!  Support veteran businesses!!"}
