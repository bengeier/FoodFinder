{"text":"My family and I gave this place a second chance and suffice it to say, it didn't change our initial opinion of the place. For the price they charge us the food isn't good not even close. The crab rangoon isn't crab rangoon; it's just cream cheese. My fiance ordered general tsao and sesame chicken, both of those dishes were the same; one just didn't have sesame seeds on the chicken. General tsao is supposed to be spicy. They used the very same sauce on both dishes. On top of that, their chicken is dry ..very dry. How is the chicken dry with sauce on it I'll never know but it was like biting down on 3 day old chicken that sat out. Chicken was so dry, it needed lotion. 

What I'm confused about the most is the rice. They're supposedly supposed to have been two boxes of WHITE rice that came with the chicken meals. They came in separate boxes, why was one box of rice discolored? When you get to the bottom, that's when the rice was white. I found that to be weird. Their portion sizes need work and the egg rolls are overcooked. The first time I ordered they forgot a few items and had to send someone else out with them, by that time it was cold. 

It takes them forever to deliver, too. I can understand the average 30-45 minute wait but when it's way beyond that timeframe, it's ridiculous. 

Overall, this is the kind of chinese food you eat when the good chinese place is closed for the day and you're drunk and need a quick bite to eat. We thought the place was having a bad day the first time we ordered and gave them the benefit of the doubt. Well fool me once...

Never again."}
{"text":"Great new owners as of April. Food is better and great delivery service. Can't wait for more"}
{"text":"By all means, skip this restaurant. China Moon used to be good, but no longer. Walking in to place an order, you can see clearly that the restaurant is not clean. The floors are filthy, the walls need scrubbed. The cieling tiles should be replaced.  Waiting for the order, I didn't want to touch anything...


I ordered a chicken and broccoli combo meal and a General Tso combo meal. Both come with fried rice and an egg roll. The egg rolls were way over cooked and dry, like they had been prepared hours ago. The chicken on the chicken broccoli combo meal was under cooked. One bite and I had to throw it out. It wasn't safe. On the other hand, the General Tso chicken was over cooked, also tasting like it had sat a while.

What a shame, and a waste of money."}
{"text":"We had China Moon for the 1st time recently. We decided to try them based off of the great reviews they had from everyone else on here. For the most part, I can say we were definitely not disappointed.

The food was really good. We tried several different items on the menu and I can say the only thing that disappointed me was the vegetable egg foo young. It was a little bland for my taste. Their beef spare ribs, kung pao chicken and vegetable lo mein were among the highlights of the meal. I would also recommend the pork egg roles and the ham friend rice. It only took them about 20 minutes to put our order together which was also great. 

I would advise people to consider ordering small portions. In the future we will do this. The large is way too much food unless you are planning on feeding an entire family. They can also get a little pricey.

All and all, if you are looking for good Chinese food in Twinsburg you really can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"I had the chicken lo mein lunch special. The special includes egg roll, fried rice and soft noodles. The price was very reasonable, less than $6. 

The restaurant tables and atmosphere was okay. There were only a few tables and a lot of space. There is no denying that this is a family owned restaurant. I guess this is why the other reviews suggested ordering food to go. 

All-in-all my experience was pleasant and I will more than likely eat here for lunch...often. I cannot wait to try all the dishes. 

I am giving the restaurant four stars for the food."}
{"text":"Exactly what a Chinese restaurant should be. 

We discovered this restaurant a week ago and have ordered twice in that time. We go online, put in our order, and tell them we want the food at 6pm. Both times- they have showed up at 5:55pm, and tonight- the roads were that stupid icy. Punctuality.

The food? Tastes like Fast Food chinese should. Let's be honest- Fast Casual chinese food is either \"What I wanted\" or \"Bad\".  This is what you want. 

The lady and I have been searching for good chinese for three years. We've finally found it. China Moon will be our place henceforth. (Now, if we can find a good Indian place in the Southeast...)"}
{"text":"Never eat here. Dirty. Horrible food. Lots of onions because they don't want to give you other veggies. Worst food ever."}

He asked if I could wait one hour because they are very busy.  I said yes; he came just about an hour and a bit later with a little child, apologizing for delay and thanking me for decent tip.

Generous portions on the two entrees, both of which had loads of crunchy broccoli pieces, etc.; they were awash in tons of thick, brown Chinese restaurant sauce."}
{"text":"Don't let the dirty floor, missing floor tiles, lack of decor fool you.  The food IS as dismal as the restaurant.  We got chicken with broccoli, House Egg Fu Young and steamed dumplings.  No flavor, limp vegetables, fried rice consisted of gray rice with no egg or vegetables.  A complete waste of $17.70!!!"}
{"text":"This place was good at one point in time and was my wife's favorite. Not any more. Just brought food home and it was terrible. The chicken from the chicken and broccoli and the chicken lo mein had that \"fresh out of the microwave\" flavor. About all I can say good is the white rice tasted good.  Hopefully we don't get sick"}
{"text":"Easy online ordering. Good quick service. Great tasting food. My family and I love to go to China Moon when we are in the mood for Chinese"}
{"text":"This was our favorite place when we lived in Twinsburg. Very good food, fast service, very friendly staff. Our favorite go to for Chinese food.  We have moved a city over now and we still make the drive (slightly out of the way) to drive to China moon and get take out."}
{"text":"Food at this restaurant is so amazing I could not believe it honestly looking at the state of the place but I will get to that later, I ordered the boneless spare ribs with pork lo mein and fried rice and let me tell you it blow me away what an amazing flavor. After this I was hooked, another  amazing dish is the Moo shoo  pork, dumplings,orange chicken, Kung pao chicken well everything is great just one thing I had to point out, do not eat inside the restaurant have it delivered or carry out trust me and thank me later. But besides this it is my first choice when I had to go to Twins burg to run some errands."}
{"text":"Kids eat this not very good food for the $6 lunch special. Ok for them-but not \"good Chinese food\" if you know what I mean. Ok take out is the best I'll give it-depending on who cooks it."}
{"text":"Will never go here again.  We used to order takeout a couple times a month.  In the last year or so, the quality has gone downhill.  Big time downhill.  

The place is dirty and always freezing!!!  Slow as can be.  There is always a kid there who just sits on his iPad.  Makes me feel sorry that kid isn't having a childhood."}
{"text":"I've been eating at China Moon for years and they never disappoint. My family has even ordered huge amounts of food from them and served it at parties. Everyone I know loves this place. I usually get the Rangoon with sesame chicken and it's consistently good."}
