{"text":"I live \"near\" this place, but \"nearer\" to other earlier established Mexican grills in this quadrant of the city. I have tried them all. This place has got them beat hands down in both price and flavour. I stopped in on a whim because I was excited that a Mexican grill was actually  on my drive home. Lucky for me it was their \"soft launch\" night. I ordered fish (crispy basa) tacos, beef quesadillas, regular tacos and a grilled chicken burrito. The quesadillas were flavourful and tender. Fresh toppings help the taste. The beef had the perfect combination of salt and mexican flavouring (I think it's adobo, but I'll defer to those more in the know). The tacos were amazing, esp. the fish. Still crispy after a 10 minute drive (stop and go rush hour). One of the quesadillas had a pineapple sauce in it; a really nice addition. But the mother of all was the burrito...OH MINE BURRITO! I have never (in this city) tasted a fresher burrito for this price anywhere. If I can compare the vibe; in between a mucho burrito/chipotle and a Mexican \"cantina\"like La Mexicana/Milagro/La Carnita. These guys (young energetic owners, I understand) just opened a jewel if they keep serving what they served me this evening. Good on ya! Good luck and I'll be back. Oh, and the 4 stars should be 4and 1/2 but I couldn't figure out what to press. I never give 5 bc no one's perfect."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Ordered off of uber eats. Got a chicken/yam bowl and a pork al pastor bowl. The portions were huge and everything was extremely fresh. Totally recommend! Like a better version of chipotle!"}
{"text":"Ordered it for lunch.  Had a big order at work and everyone enjoyed the food! From their pork bowls to Quesaddillas and their Burritos! Everything was super fresh and tasty!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place, the decor is fresh, modern and clean and there are not many healthy options in this area. 

Three people in my office ordered burrito bowls and none of us could finish them as they were WAY too salty, mushy and inedible. The best part of the bowl was the guac. 

Service is a little slow but I am sure this will get better with time. I do hope they fix the salt problem."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing and full of flavour! The customer service was great and the portion sizes are even better. This place will not disappoint. Its underrated in my opinion. Definitely better than any Zteca or Chipotle that I've been too."}
{"text":"If taco/burrito was a family business- Cali Mexican Grill would be the younger cooler version of chipotle. 

I say that because they follow almost the exact same formula- even the seating and layout. The menu is eerily similar as well. However what impressed me was the toppings that they had that was different from chipotle. Like the pineapple and cilantro. Also the option to put \"crunchie\" which is basically toritlla chips crumbled onto your burrito.

The place was shiny and shimmery and sooo soo clean. I am a fan."}
{"text":"Was in Toronto on a business trip and stumbled across this gem. This place is as legit as the food spots in Southern California where I have lived for 12 years. It's perfect food if you are on the go and want to get a great meal at a good price. Highly recommend this spot."}
{"text":"Really good!
I got the fish tacos and they were excellent.
Loved the available sauces and toppings I was pleasantly surprised. Definately worth a visit"}
{"text":"The place is clean and the staff are very nice. We ordered tacos and chips. They were okay but very heavy on the pepper in the el pastor as well as the guacamole. Also was expecting corn tortillas but they serve flour. Overall, not a bad choice as the food was okay, but if I wanted more authentic mexican food, I'd go to another place. Note: seats are backless bar stools on a concrete floor so not the safest if you're with toddlers."}
{"text":"I got the beef burrito and sweet chilli one. The burritos were huge. Really good flavour and loved the variety of toppings they had. Were very fresh. So glad they opened up near my place. Will definitely get them again."}
{"text":"Got a chicken bowl and they were super stingy on the toppings. We got a small sprinkle of cheese, 4 pineapples and like 3 peppers. Also don't get complimentary tortilla or a second choice of rice like Chipotle does which is unfortunate. For next time I'd much rather just head to Yorkdale across the street and pay the same price for a better bowl at Chipotle."}
{"text":"Ordered:
Chicken burrito
Pork Al Pastor burrito

$8.45 each.
Guacamole extra $1.

Fresh ingredients.
Big burrito.

Very clean.
Very modern design.
Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Updating my review because after an order was made incorrect to two days ago, I've been trying for two days now to contact a manager but every time I call he's busy or just stepped out or is on the phone. I even instagram messaged and have yet to get a response. It's been two days of this now. Good customer service was obviously a fluke the first time I went and this is what it's actually like: unresponsive. Try this place out and pretend like it's a game of roulette: you might get good service, you might not."}
{"text":"Grabbed lunch here for the first time.

It's like Chipotle but better, the pineapple and red pepper in my burrito bowl was a great addition! Will be back again!"}
