{"text":"I love this little place. They always have the freshest produce. I usually buy a muffin or one of their healthy and yummy salads. Probably the best muffins I've ever had - crispy tops, jam packed with flavour bottoms. Quinoa salad and lentil salad - both amazing."}
{"text":"Great friendly service! They have nice quick healthy lunches you can grab and go, as well as fresh baked goods. In the summer they have a few plants you can buy as well as fresh cut flowers. Prices are very reasonable!"}
{"text":"I first heard about Reesor from my cousin who was buying maple syrup & produce from their farm on 9th line. We started stopping in here on our way to our cottage. Well sort of a detour since our previous place just doesn't cut it anymore.

Fresh baked items, great selection and love the variety of jams, spreads etc. Easy stop when you factor in how great their quality is! My kids love the molasses crinkle cookies and oatmeal/raisin cookies."}
{"text":"Great customer service and fresh produce! It's just fun to take my son to pick food or pumpkins come the holiday season. Love the fact it's in stouffville so it's close to home too. Only minus is their parking lot is gravel and makes for pushing the shopping cart to the car a bit harder for seniors."}
{"text":"I love Reesor's Farmer Market but unfortunately it is only opens from June to Fall, but luckily Reesor also operates Reesor's Market & Bakery on Main Street Stouffville which is opens year round!

The smell of freshly baked goods really hit you the moment you walked in but in a good way. Cookies, Muffins, Cakes, Breads all baked in house... 

Reesor's also carries produces from bakeries, chocolatier (Charlinda), Coffee Roaster (Velvet Sunrise) in the neighbourhood and Ontario.

Definitely worth checking out if you are in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Reesor is a well known farming family in Toronto/GTA.  It is no surprise that Reesor's Market & Bakery is a miniature farmers' market.  I visited one Saturday afternoon in winter to sate a butter tart craving.  I found fresh farmers' market quality and home-styled baked good made by local producers at Reesor's.  I also expected and found fresh produce, small batch home-style soup in jars, gourmet cheese from Ontario and Quebec and gourmet cold cuts.  What I didn't expect were an array gourmet ready-to-heat frozen dinner entrees, including gluten free frozen dinner entrees, gluten free pantry and baking groceries, organic groceries, antibiotic free and organic meat, etc..  Reesor's Market is right on pulse on the food trends.  

If you are not particularly in need of organic and gluten free products, you would find the shelves and shelves of gourmet and unique pantry groceries vastly interesting.  Here I found soup beanie bags (just add meat and cook a pot of stew or soup), spices and rubs, gourmet chilli sauces and cooking sauces, honey by Ontario beekeepers, local jams, speciality pasta, locally roasted ground coffee beans, chips and dried fruits, etc..  I was so amazed.  I ran through shelves after shelves.  I walked out of the store with butter tarts, a bag of soup beanie bag to make a Chuckwagon Chilli, and a can of Piri Piri Chicken Dry Rub.  My dinner mate was in for a treat that evening."}
{"text":"Freshly baked bread, muffins, pies... We usually go to the bakery on Stouffville rd. My hubby loves their lies, kinda pricy $12 for a pie but worth it for a treat.
They also have a good selections of jams, spreads, and sauces"}
