{"text":"A less pretentious place you will not find in the Valley. Good assortment of beer on tap (including my current favorites, Sierra Nevada Pale Ale & Widmer Hefeweizen), and every night they have a different beer special for $4 in a giant mug. A giant mug of decent beer, that is--none of this Extra Lite Carbonated American Urine stuff. I think they regularly have a bottled beer special too.   The people-watching is good. On the weekends, expect groups of shrieking ladies in their 40s w/ excellent 1980s hairdos being ogled by middle-aged guys with large, round stomachs.   Other entertainment includes a pool table, table shuffleboard, and many flat-screen TVs w/ sports. Bonus: We ended up there on a Saturday night during karaoke and were treated to a guy in his mid-50s belting out \"I wanna fuck you like an animal!\" with great enthusiasm. I hadn't expected that when we left the house for the evening.  The food is basic but edible. Apparently they have a 10-inch burger. I find the idea somewhat nauseating, but I suppose it would be money-saver if divided among several people. It's important to line your stomach with a big slab of protein before downing big $4 mugs of beer, one after another.  Service-wise, the bartenders are quite good, but table service is hit and miss, particularly if the place is busy."}
{"text":"Swingers Bar???Okay I pass by this bar everyday on my way to work and convinced my husband to take me there. I knew as soon as I walked in it was a mistake but I figured it was a little late and to just stay and give it a chance... There were 4 of us and we sat down finally 8 minutes later a waitress comes over and asks us what did you guys have again? I was like we just got here. Ordered our drinks and  I started to look around and noticed there were alot of people making out with many different people in the same groups... Could this be a swingers bar?..ewww we drank our beer down asked for our tab to be closed out and the waitress gave us some other guys credit card..didn't even ask us our name..had to yell wait to get her back to get our credit card back.. Never ever going there again..."}
{"text":"It's out of my hood, but had to check it out anyway.  While waiting for a friend, I sat at the bar next to a gentleman that had recently been cut off.  Instead of asking him to leave, he hung around telling everyone how he had been cut off - and by everyone I mean anyone sitting at the bar and anyone that would answer his phone call. (He was obviously a regular - every bar has at least 1 of those, if you know what I mean)  I know the \"you have 30 minutes to secure a ride rule\", but his friends were there to take him, which means the 30 minutes does not apply.  Anyway, once I got a bartender's attention the service was good.  They were training someone new and she was very nice and polite.    I was told to order one of the hot pretzels so that's what I did.  Holy CRAP!  The sauce was not what I was expecting....it was every better!  I didn't have time to try anything else, but I will be back with my friend to try some other items.  The pricing wasn't bad, there were sports on the TV and there is a smoking patio.  Coolest thing:  TV's in the booths!"}
{"text":"I used to love it here. What a great hang out and on weekends there was always a good breakfast to be eaten but not today! We went back to one of our favorite places to have a bloody may and some decent eggs, potatoes and bacon but were not happy. The first thing on the breakfast menu was a draft beer which tasted moldy and strange. I ordered a Bloody Mary - but really a vodka and tomato juice since I'm allergic to Tabasco and all red peppers. I was talked into ordering the bloody mary bar for 3 bucks and juice on the side. I had no idea I was going to pay 5.50 for crappy bloody mary fixings and a small can of tomato juice. The bloody mary bar fixings were so crappy that  that I only drank the juice and vodka on the second round but was still charged  5.50. I have never been charged more than the 3 bucks on many other days. All I got was a BS  \"sorry we have to\" response. Then we ordered breakfast which was why we were there. We ordered an exotic breakfast of 2 eggs over medium w potatoes and bacon \"crisp\". That was to prevent them from serving us very undercooked bacon and potatoes which happens in a lot of places. We waited 25 minutes for our breakfasts. The eggs were undercooked with slimy whites  and the bacon was certainly crisp - it was burned. I guess so much for the nostalgia of breakfasts at Hazlewoods. The crummy service and overpriced drinks will keep us away for a long time. The waitress was nice and pleasant but gave us the wrong check to boot. I should have just paid it and left ( it was for much less money) but the honest person who still likes Rich Hazlewood wouldn't allow me to steal from him. This was a great place for a simple weekend breakfast but not any more. Why did I tip her?"}
{"text":"Visited Hazelwoods today for Yelp Book Club.  While I had a blast talking with the group about the book, I was less than thrilled with the restaurant.  Was the service bad because of the USA/Canada gold medal hockey game?  There were a lot of people there, but I wouldn't necessarily call it \"crowded.\"  The only way to get the waitress to come to our table was by flagging her down.  Even that didn't work sometimes.  On the bright side, I actually enjoyed my French Dip quite a bit.  But the lack of quality service trumps the food in this case.  Plus, it's far from where I live, so I won't be back."}
{"text":"We came in on Thursday for trivia. We already had dinner so I enjoyed a delicious Moose Drool which was the Thursday special and snacked on a giant pretzel! The pretzel was 10 inches, buttered and salted perfectly! They serve it with a spicy beer cheese which was a nice change from plain cheese. It had a nice kick and great flavor. Trivia was well run and service was decent.  We had a nice experience and will be back for sure."}
{"text":"If you want a good place to watch sports in Arcadia you don't really have a ton of options.  Hazelwoods, despite some shortcomings, is great for that.  It's a lot like college in that it is what you make of it.  And also like college, the more you go the better your experience will be (see: learning curve).  For instance, those that have been there know it's not really the best place for food.  Typical bar fare with certain dishes (spicy beer cheese, fries) that will stay with you, and not in a good way.  On the other hand, if you eat before you go and are merely looking for a place to kick back and have a beer or three while watching the Dbacks or Cards, or play trivia, then Hazelwoods is an option worth considering.  Cool, comfortable, cold beer."}
{"text":"Our photo booth company (Digital Expressions Open Photo Booths) was hired for a birthday party.  The manager was very accommodating and easy to work with.  I also had their award-winning chili.  It was spicy hot, but very good."}
{"text":"this place blows. the waitress was so horrible, and just stood there and talked to some douches at the bar while we were waiting for her to acknowledge us so we could get beer. i had a burger and it was so messy i actually had to eat it with a fork, and that's weird. it wasn't horrible tasting, i suppose, but still, this place is dumb.  they do have playmakers, though. so, 1 star. we probably won't ever go back."}
{"text":"Best bar in phx. Angie is the best! Wings are great. Miss the were potato tots though!"}
{"text":"Bar food is well - bar food, but it's executed well!  Company is great at trivia nights, service is ALWAYS friendly and timely...I just switched from 3 stars to 4 stars writing this... Place gets an A for effort.  Could use a modern makeover, but maybe that's why the place has that throwback copper roof charm where everyone knows your name."}
{"text":"Hazelwood's boasts 15 flat screen TVs to showcase everything from baseball to extreme fighting to NASCAR to football. The bar is laid back and cozy and offers a nice-sized patio. They have live music and attacts a 20 to 60-something crowd.  This is definitely a neighborhood bar, attracting a friendly crowd. And there's an abundance of beers on tap."}
{"text":"I sure miss you guys, it is tough to find a home base as good as The Woods.  Best of luck Craig, you had things running smooth, as good as we'd seen going back to 02'!!!  Hope football season treats you all very well!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to this sports bar before, and have had poor service before. Decided to try again, but after today I will never go back. The waitress was horrible took forever to get our food, and even longer to get our check. This all happened when we were the first ones there, and only a few people after that. I've never left an establishment without leaving a tip. But today was a first!"}
{"text":"Been here a at least 20 times over the years and the beer has been great. The food and service, not so much. About two weeks ago I got the fish, shrimp and chips and it was more like fish flavored fried breading rather than fried fish. Went there today, the service and food was really bad. I got the lunch taco special and specifically asked what came on the tacos. Was told twice only meat and cheese. The ice cold tacos arrived and they were more than just meat and cheese. The taco meat to start was a broken up hamburger pattie (probably left over meat from the day before) and in the mixture was something like a potato maybe, some lima beans, onions, carrots and other stuff, I think. Far from just meat and cheese. This was my last visit."}
{"text":"Once again, I go here on 7/3/2010 for UFC fight Lesnar Vs Carwin. Although I'm dissapointed that they're charging a $5 cover at 5:45 even though the fights don't start til 7, I get over it quickly because Tammy, the bartender, is and always has been, top notch. I usually patronize this place twice a month, tops. Tammy remembers me, and knows what I drink. Wow.   After 2 beers ($4 25oz Dos Equis), I tell Tammy I am going outside for the remainder of the evening to smoke my cigar and watch the fights on their large, misted patio. No problem. The outside waitress (Rachel?) immediately comes over and calls me by name and asks me if I want another. Tammy's on the ball and has tranferred the check, even though I know she's slammed at the bar. Needless to say, the rest of the night was terrific. I enjoyed a good cigar, watched some good fights, and got stellar service, inside and out. I will never go to another bar to watch the UFC. Thanks Tammy."}
{"text":"WOW, I feel explaining my experience here would not even come close to how I truly felt, words cannot express. The service was TERRIBLE.  I can start with the witchy \"know-it-all\" bartender being completely rude, not helpful, and pours one awful drink.  If you order a mixed drink, don't expect any alcohol in it.  The bartender informed me they serve 3 1/2 counts per drink, and if you're a bartender like I am-you know thats not even a shot of liquor. Second, the bald manager who made inappropriate comments, and even shut the fire off on us when about 4 of us were sitting around it!  Then proceeded to cackle laughing as he was walking away to sit with two employees who probably had gotten off of work.  I also watched him down two cocktails, and smoke cigarettes while going inside and out of the patio.  That is some extreme inappropriate, dissatisfying management. I will never return to this place again, I now know why I avoided it for so long. There are WAY better sports bars within a 1/2 mile radius of there with better food, service, and ambiance. Even the diviest of dive bars are better than this crap."}
{"text":"So I came in last night with my boyfriend & mom... I ordered 2 vodka/sprites & a rum & diet coke at the bar & then decided to take a table since one had just opened up. When our waitress came we ordered one platter (samples of everything; chicken tenders, zucchini, jalapeno poppers, a couple other things..) and pita & hummus dish for my mom. When she came with the food, she asked if we had ordered a sample platter at the bar before sitting down, because it was showing that we had ordered a total of TWO sample platter & the humus dish. I said no... We didn't order ANY food at the bar.. And she kind of made it seem like I might have been lying & that we did order the meal at the bar, 1. why would I order two? 2. Why would I lie about it? Anyway she asked who I ordered from at the bar, a male or female & that she would go talk to them about it. I saw her talking to the bartender. When she came back by she didn't say anything so I asker her if it got straightened out. She said yeah, it's fine. It was stupid because she made a big deal out of it. She could have just said \"okay, there must have been a mistake.\" & told the kitchen not to make 2. But she argued with me about it a little bit. How rude. She probably just wrote that we ordered 2 on the ticket on accident and seems like she didn't want to own up to her mistake. Or she genuinely didn't think she wrote our ticket wrong & that she surely could not have made a mistake. Anyway, we got our check, and we were being charged for BOTH fricken platters!! Obviously another mistake. She took it off after we told her it was still on our ticket. She was just kind of rude, not very happy. Took kind of a long time. It was a little busy but nothing crazy! I do like Hazelwoods but was just kind of like WTF about that whole situation...  Our food was delicious though & the vodka/sprites were good. Fair prices too. Which is good because I would have given the rating something as shitty as that waitress' attitude. My other experiences have been pretty good here though."}
{"text":"The service is pretty bad here but otherwise it's an ok sports bar.  Lots of beers on draft and the food is about what you'd expect.  Decor needs an overhaul.  This place has good bones and could be a really cool spot, not sure why they can't quite get it together.  They are always making little tweaks like new uniforms, slightly different menu, etc.  Here's what they should do: tear out the child's bedroom-style carpet, take down all the crappy vinyl sports and beer signs, and get serious about prompt service!  Just because it's a sports bar doesn't mean it has to be tacky."}
{"text":"\"Hazelwoods Has It ALLLLL Wrong!\"  I thought I was safe getting my usual Saturday burger, tots, and beer cheese to enjoy while watching some football. BOY was I wrong! The order was completely ruined -- which was NOT our excellent waitresses fault -- she literally showed us what we ordered... This is because the POS system was down, so the poor girl had to hand-write everything out! The kitchen was certainly not up to par, per the last couple weeks I visited. When a sports bar need only rely on CONSISTENCY and a place to grab a very simple BEER and BURGER, this was unacceptable. Mayo and ketchup were not supposed to be on our burger, but it was, and on the BOTTOM BUN at that (ew - soggy!!!), the beer cheese had a thick, disgusting layer of hardness on top (clear sign that no one could even figure out how to turn on heat lamps!), and the vegetables for the burger were lacking (not even 1 tomato slice), and soggy. :(  Visited September 2015"}
{"text":"I sat at the bar and had to ask for my second beer - even though the bar tender walked past me several times.  The wings were on the under-cooked side. I originally went there to play Buzztime trivia and was instructed that the machines where by the door.  This would not have bothered me if both machines that I used ended up running out of power.  I will no be returning to this place."}
{"text":"Of the \"Woods\" family, that being Teak and Hazel, this is my least fave... Service is rather on the forgetful side and I found running to the bar and fetching drinks a much more efficient enterprise...Kudos to the myriad big TVs with flat screens.  I was able to distract myself from the Suns getting spanked by watching the D-Backs handle the Padres.  Food was a resounding \"meh\".  Yeah, the typical bar fare was offered, i.e. fried stuff, burgers, dogs, wings, etc.  Surprisingly they offer salads.  I for one don't believe salad should be on any bar menu, but hey, whatever works for ya! The true barometer of any \"pub\" is the fish and chips and wow was I underwhelmed...Two bricks of fish ( who knew there are square fish out there in the Pacific? ) and those brackety-netty fries that Chick-Fil-A cornered the market on - blah! Sorry fans of the woods of Hazel...I won't be back.  You can find me in the forests of Teak from now on!  PS- The only reason it got 3 stars and not 2.....Personal TV in the booth.  Kinda cool :)"}
{"text":"Used to love this place.  But now the waitress's suck.  Horrible.  Never check on you.  And when they do they forget your order.   Not the same.  Must be new management.  Been coming here for twenty years. The karaoke attendants are the best.   And draw a good crowd. On Saturday night. Also the craps dealer on Sunday night are fun."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a good meal and happy service, make sure you ask your waitress more than once what is in the food and good luck with the service. I have very specific food allergies which include a very severe bean allergy and was told the taco Tuesday taco's had only \"Meat and Cheese.\" We ordered and found that they had much more than that. If you don't include the beans, carrots, onions, and potatoes then yes... it was only Meat and Cheese. Be very careful when you order and have food allergies. You might get a trip to the hospital with your food.   The service was terrible. The manager seemed to be genuine, so I understand the concern for trying to make things right, but the waitress was terrible. If you are working for tips.. make sure you at least have a smile on your face and know how to interact with humans.   If you are here to watch a game and drink a beer, I think you might have a good time but if you are expecting to have a decent time for lunch, just head down to any of the other reasonable priced restaurants in the area. At least those people are nice and there isn't a potential food allergy waiting. (or a hair in the food)..."}
{"text":"Had a girl named Drew as our server. Great service, fun atmosphere, lots of people but not over crowded. They have about 10 different wing choices- medium wings 12 count, 2 24-oz beers, 1 pint and chips/salsa came to $23.66 during happy hour which went til 7pm. Loved it! We will be back :)"}
{"text":"Wings are good. Lots of beers. The waitresses need to pay more attention to everyone at their bar, rather than focus on regulars only while completely ignoring other people trying to get drinks. One night my sister and I eventually just left. It's really a hit or miss here. The bar tenders really need to check their attitudes and the way they talk to customers. Just because you work at a dingy dive bar does not mean its okay to be a bitch and talk trash to or about customers. Oh and the trivia night here is pointless, most of the time the \"winners\" are googling the answers to every question on their phones, sometimes right in front where it's obvious but no one says anything... Blah. No fun. Even though this place is a hop skip and a jump away, I probably won't be back. Unless I get dragged in there by someone else AND they are buying my drinks LOL. Over it!"}
{"text":"I frequent this establishment and generally ignore the poor service, but after my latest encounter they have lost me as a customer. I waited 30 min to even be acknowledged only to have longer waits for food and drinks. I have never had worse service."}
{"text":"Hazelwoods is a great neighborhood sports bar.  The staff is very friendly.   So is the crowd of Arcadians that come here.  Big beer and drink specials every night.  The nachos are tasty.  Check out the Team Trivia a few nights a week."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a few years now , over that time I've seen the prices go up and the clientele go down. This place has gotten to the point where I  can't even eat here.... $10 for a dozen wings???!! Another 1.00 to grill em??!! Jeez!! The wings are so small it's more like 7 or 8. Also they use paper menus!!! Gross and cheap!! It kills my appetite when i look down and see someone's week old food chunks and grease spots on my menu! The whole experience left me feeling like I need to wash my hands."}
{"text":"I was looking in this area for a place to watch some football. This place has several tv's with different games on. The fan base of customers varies. I ordered the Denver omelete. It was a filling breakfast. I ordered a beer on tap as well. This could be a place to go with friends or bring the family. Service was pretty quick."}
{"text":"I started to go to Hazelwoods about five years ago because that was where my friends decided they wanted to hang out.  It's a great bar.  They have wonderful food.  I would give it three stars only because of their drinks.  I'm rating it compared to JT's drinks.  They know how to pour.  Hazelwoods it a great place to walk in and feel comfortable.  I like a bar and when I say \"bar\" I mean I like a nice long wood bar.  I thin their lighting could be lower, that is my one big turn off.  What I love is their enrollment in \"Team Trivia\" on Friday nights.  If you don't know what that is then you must look it up on their sight.  It's a trivia game and the winning team gets $30 dollars in money to spend on food.  There are three winners and we usually win at least third place.  We go on rolls.  If a big sports game is being televised then get there extra early."}
{"text":"I love going here every Friday good food and it's pretty cheap the waitress already knows what we order every time we go. She even picked up on one of our friends that doesn't go every Friday and what he orders and he's only made a couple of trips there. My Favorite has to be the Pretzel and the beer cheese great combination! This place is way better than Sips next door and Zipps across the street. The bar is an oldie but a goodie :-)"}
{"text":"Probably would have never gone here if I hadn't gone with the derby dames.  Way outta my drive radius.  But they do have a mean burger!!"}
{"text":"My inner-nerd was excited to hear about NTN Buzztime and team trivia so I was stoked to come down and try this place out.    I wasn't stoked, however, to learn that NTN and team trivia were two different things.  And I wasn't stoked to wait 10 minutes for our server to wipe down our sticky table.  Regardless, this place's parking lot was packed and the bar was buzzing with Thursday night football and baseball fans drinking down pitchers and pints.  Aside from the pool table and shuffleboard, as if that alone wasn't awesome enough - they have FOOZBALL too!!  The food and service was pretty average. I ordered a grilled chicken and ortega chile  sandwich with Monterey jack cheese.  It tasted pretty bland - I ate only half, which if you know me, means it must have been pretty blah.  The fries were the zesty seasoned variety - probably frozen, but were still pretty good.  Rum and cokes here were standard as well.  Glasses were shorter than expected, but neither too weak, nor too strong.   Now to the trivia.  It's team driven and can go kind of slow.  So the bigger the group at the table, the more brainpower (but also, the more likely for differing answers and arguments).  For my friend and I, who thought we were at a disadvantage - we coasted to 3rd place (out of 10).  Not too bad, and we won a gift certificate back to Hazelwoods.  I'll use it someday I'm sure.  Like when I'm in the neighborhood or something.  Not in a big rush.   P.S.  It was Grover who was on the cover of Sesame Street Fever, in case you're wondering.  EDIT: 11/07 Ok, I'm downgrading to a one-star review, which is for the understaffed Saturday when I went to watch Big-Ten football and have some lunch with a gift certificate.  One server to about 30 people in the entire restaurant portion.  To add insult to injury, I paid with a $10 GC and left a $2 tip for an $8 lunch and the server chased me out when I left and couldn't wait any longer.  Service was so slow and the attitude of the server toward me in the parking lot was uncalled for."}
{"text":"When I want a 10 inch... I know where to go now.  My friends and I came here for trivia (Thurs @ 8pm) but was pleasantly surprised to find that they offered a 10 inch hamburger for only $10! Of course we had to try one, we split it for ways and that was plenty. It was actually pretty good. The meat was moist and flavorful, the bun held everything together. I wish we had more fries though.  We did order a basket of fries that never made its way out. Our server was nice enough to offer to comp them but we were way too full from he burger to think of eating more fries at this point.   The drink specials were good. We had $2 bottles of Bud Wheat, it was actually pretty tasty.   The trivia teams here are kinda different. Not what we're used to but every bar has their own crowd so I'm not going to ding them for this. I had a good time here and the food and service was fantastic.   One thing I have to mention is that the parking here is ridiculous when its packed for event nights (such as trivia). We were close to being boxed in by other cars."}
{"text":"Had the jalapeño burger  Dry, bland, unimpressive Even more unimpressive was the service I had to scream for silverware and the lady acted as if I was in the wrong as she talked to her friends"}
{"text":"I met up with a buddy of mine here last night for a few beverages.  The bartender was very nice and I also met the owner, who you could tell was very involved with making sure customers were happy.  I am not sure if it was because I was really hungry, but the nachos were great even though they didn't look too exciting.  I particularly liked the iced rim around the inner edge of the bar to keep drinks cool; I am sure that is great in the summer.  The patio had a fire going and people who were not playing trivia (was trivia night) seemed to be channelling that way.  Speaking of trivia, some cute older gentleman recruited us to help them with some music trivia and they were excited we could help them out :)  The patrons in general seemed very nice and friendly.  And best of all, beer is cheap!"}
{"text":"I'm not normally this negative in reviews but I think its justified here. I went in on a Wednesday night for Trivia with 5 friends. The service was bad, a waitress spoke to me once in 3 hours. The food was bad. On top of that, the trivia was literally the worst trivia I've ever been to. I've gone to Trivia in a bunch of cities and have never experienced it like hazelwoods. The questions were unchallenging and they were all spaced about 5 minutes apart so it took about 2 hours for 30 questions. The host was boring and I was counting the seconds until I could leave. Would not come back if you paid me."}
{"text":"KInd of a mixed bag here on my first visit. This is the ultimate neighborhood bar experience because nearly every dude that entered during my two-hour stay was greeted by name. I had read about happy Hour specials online prior, but when I asked about them to the heavily tattooed bargirl, she didn't mention them, instead telling me about the higher priced all-day special. How can you get new regulars if you treat the newcomers like we are from Planet Mar?  Maybe they got enough regulars, but they might need to get younger cause some of regulars are getting old. She did become nicer after I chatted up one of her old buddies at the bar and she even put the Yankees game on the small bar TV for me. The food I ordered to go contained the worst version of sweet potato fries ever - burnt and undercooked at the same time (see photo). The Western Chicken was pretty good though featuring two giant onion rings and a rather large thin cut chicken breast covered with cheese and bonus bacon which wasn't on the original description. The bun took a beating with too much BBQ sauce, but overall not bad. It is supposed to get crowded at night, might check it out then and happy Hour prices are good on domestics also."}
{"text":"I'm usually a big fan of dive bars but wasn't impressed, at all.  One of the kegs was empty so my friends didn't get their \"favorite\" beer, not a huge deal but not a good thing for 5pm on a Friday.  The servers seemed really overwhelmed and was probably due to the fact that there were only 4 for the entire place and it was really busy.  On a very positive note, my friends said that the food was really good for bar food.  This might be a great place for any day and time other than happy hour on a Friday."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I had been there unfortunately nothing has changed the atmosphere was dead and the drinks were overpriced most people go across the street to zips I won't be back"}
{"text":"I to really wanted to like the place. It seems to have a lot of cars in the lot when I go by so I stopped in tonight at 6:30 on a Friday. There were not that many tables occupied but the stools at the bar were full.   I walked up to the bar and ordered a Vodka Collins and asked for a menu. I was thrown off guard when the bartender asked me what that was! I told her how to make the drink. Which was served in the wrong type of glass and without a garnish!    I decided then that $4 was all this place was getting from me!  I am so sick of bars hiring untrained bartenders because they think a cute girl or guy is all that is required. Well I'm not gay and I don't like girls so this doesn't work for me. And the guys usually don' appeal to me either if they are clueless.  I don't tip the clueless. That's my new motto. The drink still was not up to par so I sucked it down and called it a night.  As for the rest of the service; I was asked by 3 waitresses if I would like to order since I had a menu in the 29 minutes I was there, but when I first came in I could not find one.  The menu was not very appealing so I probably will never return."}
{"text":"I recently have been frequenting this bar to watch sports and play trivia.  It is a nice neighborhood sports bar. I like it much better than the chains around town. Burgers are good. service is good. Can get a bit warm but just go into the bathrooms and cool off."}
{"text":"Good happy hr love the bartenders and staff. Food is good jalapeño poppers and wings my favorite. Great place to watch football happy hr is good and they have daily specials.   Just heard they are closing sold the building."}
{"text":"Horrible for food, but great for beer and watching T.V.  I work nearby and thought this would be a great place for me and the co-workers to have lunch. The atmosphere is great. I love that they have a punching bag machine but the food is as greasy and fried as they come. On the up side they have great deals on beer but that is the only thing worth paying for.  On my most recent visit, we ordered the Taco Tuesday tacos. First we asked what come's on them and the (haggered looking) waitress said \"It's just meat and cheese.\" Come to find out it's made up of what looks to be the left-over beef from the week before, combined with some random beans and a lot of diced up onions, which is all said to have been \"pre-made\" by our lovely waitress. While inspecting this creation of a taco, we learned that it wasn't even cooked all the way; the bottom was still as cold as my ranch. When the waitress came by the \"check on us\" even though she looked like nothing mattered to her anyway, my co-worker who ordered the tacos said he doesn't like onion at all and had no clue it was in the taco (we thought it was only \"meat and cheese\"). The waitress said \"O, it's pre-made, What do you want me to do about it?\" Mmmmmmm.......Well I want you to take it back and throw it in the trash and make me something fresh! Errrr!  Our experience didn't end there, as the rest of us continued with our meal, another co-worker found a dark strand of hair weaved in a fry. This instantly killed most of our appetites and made all of us examine every inch of our food before proceeding to eat.   When the checks arrived, I requested to speak to a manager who was much more pleasant than the waitress. She apologized for our service and took care of the people who ordered the tacos and had the \"hairy-fry.\" Though the manager was nice, the damage was already done and we will not be coming back.  I'd rather go back to Zipps for greasy food and beer or The Stand; they have nicer service by far!"}
{"text":"Not a place that I would choose to go under normal circumstances, but my coworkers selected this as our Friday happy hour. The exterior and interior are nothing pretty to look at, but it is certainly a good place to gather with a whole bunch of random friends/coworkers. It has a bit of a \"cheers\" vibe to it. Unfortunately the Arnold Palmer drink that I ordered was very watered down, and someone said the same about their margarita. Chips and salsa were decent. Service was attentive. They didn't mind when we kept pulling stools up to the table as people kept arriving. We all had a good time! Overall- I would come here again for a work event, but not on my own."}
{"text":"A so-so sports bar that treats us well on Tuesday nights. The karaoke is scary (I'm really not a fan of that \"art form\") and the tables are really small so we can't ever fit our whole team around one table.  The drinks and food come fast and they're an okay price.   Not a bad stop but I wouldn't go out of my way, especially considering that Zipps is right across the street."}
{"text":"You're looking at last night's trivia winner right here. Oh, yeah, be impressed. It only took 6 months.   My friends and I have been meeting up almost every week for trivia at Hazelwoods. It's just a really good excuse to get together, catch up, and show off some smarts (or stupidity). The waitresses are really nice, and the food is actually pretty good. The garbage can cheesesteak wit wiz is blowing my mind (and my gut) right now. I don't see any reason to hate on this place. It's like Cheers. How can you not like it?"}
{"text":"I have visited hazelwoods over ten times. I like the food and the set up of the bar in general. I want to like this bar and have given it a fair chance. Despite this I will not be returning. The day time wait staff has been unfriendly and has not made any attempt to engage me as a customer. With direct competition across the street I expected more of an effort to keep potential repeat business. I have repeatedly not been greeted in a friendly manner, been engaged as a customer, or thanked for my business in any way. I work in the service industry and understand and value of taking care of your regulars. I will not be returning to this restaurant with other options in the immediate vicinity."}
{"text":"We use to eat here at least once a week. Cooks keep changing and food gets worse and worse. Sad because we loved coming and enjoying the great food."}
{"text":"Never going back again. Ordered a hamburger \"medium\" and when we received it \"well done\",we requested to speak to the manager. Craig the manager explained to us with his racial slurs of how his Latin cook must of cooked it too long. He finds that \"The Latins\" tend to over-cook everything. Thanks for your ignorance Craig. We will never return."}
{"text":"We went here last night for the first time.  We really enjoyed it.  We sat down at the bar and the bartender greeted us right away.  She was really nice.  The next thing we noticed was that the bar had an icy edge to it.  The part of the bar that's closest to the bartender is covered in ice and that's where your drink stays so it keeps cold.  How cool is that?  Pun intended.    Also, we had awesome timing, because Trivia started at 8pm and we just made it.  We enjoy playing trivia, which Hazelwood's has 3 nights a week.    They also have a pool table, foozeball, shuffelboard, a boxing game, and big buck hunter.  They also have dartboards, but you have to bring your own steeltip darts.    For those Jack Daniels lovers, they have single barrel and it was just $6.50.  There are about 16 beers on tap, including Guinness.    Give this place a try."}
{"text":"This place truly sucks ass even for a sports bar. After a late night trip to Zipps, the waitress said they stopped serving food so she recommends Hazelwoods across the street. Yes granted they serve food late in the night, however I would rather have stayed hungry then eat their food again. The wings were terrible and flavorless. The pizza tasted like it was frozen and to thaw it out, it was tossed in the microwave to be served. I cannot stress how bad their food is. Karaoke night was horrible as they let older drunks take a stab at classic songs. The place reeked of piss. Please save yourself the time and money and stay far away from here."}
{"text":"I can't stand this place. It's always filled with a bunch of drunks, it smells, and the karaoke could put me in the grave. The last time I went, I was DD and the waitress tried getting a double tip out of my drunk friends. I didn't appreciate her taking advantage of my friends (who had no clue what was going on) so swore I'd never be back. And, I haven't."}
{"text":"Hazelwoods is one of those neighborhood bars you pass by during your commute home and might not give it a thought. The outside isn't screaming \"Look at me!\" but inside, it's the people that does. It is a bit dark but the outside patio is available for you sun worshippers, which I didn't get to check out. I was impressed that the owner/manager accommodated our football needs on Sunday Funday. Staff is a bit slow but maybe because they don't want to intrude during football games. Without a doubt, there's enough TVs to give you sensory overload but hey who can resist beefcakes on the screen?  If you want cheap and good breakfast, nothing fancy, this is way better choice than any Denny's or IHOP. Where can you get breakfast with a Bloody Mary for under $10? Anyone that offers that will get at least 4 stars in my book :)"}
{"text":"Go during the week in the daytime!! The best bartender ever!! Service was prompt and she'll never let your drink run dry!! Haven't had a bad thing on the menu!!! Can't wait to watch the football games here on Sunday's!!"}
{"text":"Great bar, great service and great bar food.  We meet here once a month for our drinking club with a running problem (phoenixhhh.org) for our mis-management meeting and always have a great time.  They even have some options for those of us who are vegetarian."}
{"text":"Tonight, for the first night ever since I've touched the U.S. Territory, I have experienced xenophobia. We were in a karaoke bar, and I put my name in to rap The prince of Bel Air in Italian. I started to sing it, and the whole crowd started to scream \"USA USA USA,\" seemingly to drown out my Italian version...I get it, I am in your country! I realize I was singing in a language you didn't  understand,BUT, facts: 1: I do speak English, on top of speaking other languages  2: I respect your American culture, and I am blending with you all, i love it! 3: almost all of those people have non-native American heritage, meaning we all come from somewhere different. I think that it always is unfair to quickly judge others. I think that acceptance is key of today's world. I think that there's so much more than United States or Italy or whatever other country, fuck all nationalism! There is so much more. Let's love and understand each other, I want to believe that we can be better than that."}
{"text":"Hazelwood's is dark and dingy, and the clientele can be a little sad. It's a dive. That's just what it is.  But Hazelwood's has a special place in my heart for two reasons:  1) You can get nearly ANY game here, and enough TVs that you can usually get audio. It may not be as posh as Zipp's, and the wings might not be as good, but if you want to watch a game, Hazelwood's is the place. I used to watch nearly every Trail Blazers game here before I had a kid.  2) They have Big Sky IPA on draft, one of the finest standard IPAs in America, and a rare find anywhere.  Oh, and there's a pretty good trivia game, too."}
{"text":"So we have been looking to change up our scenery a bit on football Sundays from our typical joints. We found this place by accident really. He thought it was a different place... to our happy surprise it was not. So we went in to check it out. Since our first visit, we've been back 3 more times. The food is decent, it is a chill spot to go sometimes but it can be a bit pricey so just be aware how much you drink :)"}
{"text":"Pretty nice sports bar not quite half moon size and ambiance. But, this place has really good Hamburgers a Lil better than the yard house IMO. And the prices are better  than a lot of similar quality bars. I liked the TVs in the Boothe's even though msnbc was on lol, liberal bar? Probably but worth going back to many more times for a burger."}
{"text":"This sports bar reminded me of \"Cheers\" everyone knows everyone! From customers, to bartender, cooks and servers. Went last night with a good friend who comes here all the time. It was karoke and I do not do karoke but this place was jammin! Everyone was into it! Friendly service! THE NACHOS were the best I have had in Phoenix (debating going again tonight JUST TO ORDER THE NACHOS) The wings were yummy too! Both were suggested by our server. This bar isn't in My neighborhood, but I will make the drive again and again. See U soon!!!!"}
{"text":"I like this place! I went here for a little day drinking and had a good time. Talked to a couple of regulars from the neighborhood and just hung out. The beer was cold and the best thing was that it stayed that way.  If you sit at the bar, there is a frozen strip that you can set your beer on and it keeps it nice and chilled. Very cool concept!!   They have a tone of TV's and they also have a laid back staff. Go check it out for your self."}
{"text":"This is a great place to watch a game from the TVs in the booths to great game day specials like happy hour food pricing all day (like an inexpensive pretzel the size of a dinner plate!), $3 domestic pints and $5 Titos or Jameson!  They even open at 9AM during peak game watching season and have a breakfast menu!  There is a pool table and shuffle board to entertain yourself when the game's not on (or if you need to divert your attention)."}
{"text":"Came here to watch UNI dominate #1 kansas, and watch the wrestling championships and got a great server! Had some hot wings and a kobe buger that was one of the best bugers i've had in a long time! They had a pretty good drink and food special and a nice atmosphere. Next time I'm back in Phx I'll be come back for sure."}
{"text":"I live close to this place and they open early for hangover breakfast and have delicious pancakes and AMAZING onion rings.   My boyfriend and I like to devour onion rings as early as possible in the morning and these are amazing and conveniently located.   But: the service is AWFUL. WORST SERVICE EVER. even when we are the first customers there in the morning, the waitresses sit in a booth and watch TV and never come back. when its medium crowded, the waitresses disappear. when its overcrowded, they never come back.   they dont pay attention to who walks in first... so if you walk in and sit down farther from a table being served, the waitress will skip you and go serve the person who is closest to her (but walked in 10 minutes after you).   my boyfriend and I joke that we have an abusive relationship with hazelwoods. we are like beaten wives -- going back because we love the onion rings, but knowing we are going to get treated awfully.  one time i asked for a vinegarette and received raspberry walnut vinegarette and had an allergic reaciton (nut allergy). the waitress never came back to bring us our check.  ive had to get up many times to find the waitress on slow, empty days to pay the check.  the last three times we've been we have walked out before being served because we've waited over 10 minutes in a moderately empty restaurant or the waitress has served someone who came in after us first.   sometimes you will sit for 20 minutes without acknowledgement our menus.  the management is NEVER THERE. its like no one is running the ship."}
{"text":"I REALLY wanted to like this place!  Good location, good sports decor, large cheap pitchers, and bar sports (pool, darts, foosball, scuffle board), but alas, I did not.  I have to agree with some (most) of the other Yelpers when I say the service was subpar.  Usually I can handle poor service if the food is decent (I know, I know, it's bar food) but even for bar food, it wasn't very enjoyable.  I mean, HOW on EARTH do you mess up a cheese crisp and chicken tenders?!?      We may go back for a late night foosball game and a health dose of beer, but as far as dinner, drinks and sports.... I sadly say, head across the street to Zipps."}
{"text":"Macaroni and cheese was better than average, but they just through on a ton of cheese. Good price for captain Morgan's during happy hour. The pretzels are huge, and the dip is spicy."}
{"text":"We were just visiting and came here on a Sunday night for some Sunday Night Football and Euchre.  We ordered the regular tots and sweet potato tots, and both were very good; I really liked the sweet potato tots.  The wings are great, and the fiesta salad with carne asada was just amazing.  Staff is really friendly, and the bar itself is really active - in addition to the nice little TV in our booth, it was poker night and free-play craps.  We ordered dessert also - a full basket of yummy zeppelinis for only $5.50! If we lived in Phoenix, we would definitely frequent this bar =)."}
{"text":"My buddies and I came out to Phoenix for Spring Training.  We flew in on a Thursday night and decided to check out the bar scene. One buddy knows a guy in Scottsdale and tells us to check it out.  My buddy and I get there and its more of a pool hall atmosphere (ie NO CHICKS!!!).  We joined our other buddies at a table and had a full pint of beer (only $3!!!).    Atmosphere was dead for a Thursday night, few if any chicks and the guy at the bar attempting karoake was loud and annoying.....  so we probably went here for all the wrong reasons...maybe not a college type bar scene"}
{"text":"I'm giving Hazelwood's a tentative 3 stars.  It seems as if they've fixed their service issues.  I've been there a few times for happy hour in the past month and they seem to have implemented a team service method.  Still good food and nice cold beer."}
{"text":"I've been hanging out here a bit since it's on the way home. I've never sat in the booths so my experience is restricted to the bar. The BAR! I never saw one where they iced it down to keep you glass cold, so that was cool. I've had the wings they are decent and the bartenders are attentive enough to warrant hanging out here."}
{"text":"[Edit/Update]:  Okay, Hazelwood's has stepped up their game.  they now have flatscreens outside for a perfect outdoor gamewatching experience -- or if inside is the way you swing, then each booth boasts its very own 15 inch LCD.  Their wing selection has grown and their beer continues to be on a rotating special.  This place is a premier game watching spot.  I really love this place as a happy hour spot especially because they have the tastiest wings in the valley and because they have a specialty beer on sale every day (maybe its a weekly sale -- don't go consistently enough to know).  Oh, and these beers are huge too.  Some nights, Thursdays i think, you will run into the Roller Derby Girls post-practice or post-fire-bombing, whatever.  Frankly they frighten me, but I find it pretty intriguing that they go there to get lit.   If the Roller Derby ain't your thing then they have plenty of large flat screens to watch a sporting event.  Their set up is pretty conducive for good game-watching.  They have some table games like shuffleboard (fun) and foosball (fun) and videogames like Big Buck Hunter (dumb -- for my dweeb friends only).  Hazlewood's also has one of the best smoking patios in the Central area -- its huge and you can usually find a good seat.  Typically, we park it out here for the majority of the night.  Trivia night used to be pretty cool as well, but got to be sooo cool that everyone we knew would join us on Thursday nights and fuck up our sweet answers.  Stupid friends.  The four star ranking is a result of: ~ Great wings ~ Good beer specials ~ Good smoking patio ~ Interesting clientle  ~ Good game watching"}
{"text":"The good:  * Beer specials - Each night there is a draft beer available in a 24 ounce mug for 4 dollars. * Wings - Try the spicy garlic. You can get them baked if you like it that way too. * TVs - Tons of them and booths have them as well. Always lots of sports on if that's your thing. * Bartenders - Easy on the eyes and usually friendly, unless you're a drunk/creepy guy.  The bad:  * Waitresses - Usually overworked on busy nights, it can take a few minutes to be served or get another drink. Order a pitcher or a 24 ounce mug to avoid waiting long times between service, or if halfway done with a drink and the waitress comes by, order another drink early. Words to live by if you go to a busy bar/restaurant.  * Music - Local music is more often a miss than a hit. Just be aware that sometimes it happens and if you can avoid it you should. Plus it takes away the shuffleboard and pool table area, so those won't be useable during a band.  * Karaoke - I like a good round/night of karaoke but the nights they have it are usually pretty bad. Maybe I've just been unlucky and been there on especially drunken nights. Either way it was hard to sit through. (shots helped though)  * Rowdy Sports Fans - Sometimes things get a bit crazy here during big games, so be prepared if you go on such a night. Big cheap beers and really excited sports fans sometimes means a super loud and occasionally obnoxious environment."}
{"text":"I tell ya, we have been to Hazelwoods A LOT.  But after last night and the continuous nights of crappy service, it was our last.  The place is half full and you get service as if they were both slammed and understaffed, it makes no sense.  Last night we constantly saw the girl we thought was our server (not sure as she never came back) constantly going towards the bathroom.  Hmmmmmm.  It's not like she was going to a stockroom then coming back with supplies.    We loved Hazelwoods because it's a good place to watch a sporting event, the food is good, the wings are good but not hot enough, (even the suicide are like medium), and the beer selection is good.  These things, however, are overshadowed by the crap service. The waitstaff, consisting of all females, is just the worst.  We have spent too many occassions either never having a server approach our table or once they do, they never come back.  When they drop off your food, then never ask if you want anything else or check back to see how the food is.  When they drop off the check they do not ask if they can get you anything else or if you need something else they will gladly get it.  They do not refill waters, even when you have downed 4 steins of beer, they simply do not care to get or refill anything that is not making the check grow.  I'm a former server of many years, am I too criitical?  No.  I simply knew how to get better tips out of my customers.  Too many times my husband and I have been irritated in Hazelwoods rather than having a good time, that tells me no more visits there.  Bye bye Hazelwoods."}
{"text":"Excellent service, fun Team Trivia nights, a happening sports bar.   Location: Off 36th St and Indian school. Parking is OK but sometimes when crowded, like on a Friday night, it's impossible to find a spot near the bar.    Food: The bar serves kind of typical bar food, like nachos, hot dogs, big pretzels, and sandwiches. There are other options as well. The pretzel is tasty, but I haven't tried much else. There are other fried apps as well.    Drinks: I order the cider, and you can order pitchers of cider too.  There are beers and cocktails as well.   Service:  A+  The servers here are friendly, timely and helpful. I have been going to Team Trivia here for over six years, and some of the same servers are still here. They will do separate bills, come check up on our table multiple times, and refill drinks constantly.    Ambiance: This is a typical sports bar and they host Team Trivia Weds, Thurs and Fri nights. It's free, and your team can win gift cards to use for food/drinks!  Get there early, or your team may not get a table."}
{"text":"The food is not all too great here. Its mediocre at best to put it into terms i suppose.  My boyfriend and I have been here a good number of times now and mostly just enjoy being with our certain friends that live down the street and playing pool and what not here b/c there is plenty to do if you come on like a double date get together ordeal.  I do not know how to order that huge burger here b/c every time i over look the menu i can never find it for the life of me!  I know myself, I would never be able to finish it on my own, but just the idea of ordering something that huge would be a crazy thing to see and do.  Service here is also mediocre at best nothing that makes me remember this place for that reason.  This place is more for just a okay place to get together at and watch the games or play them."}
{"text":"Hazelwoods is one of my favorite bars in Phoenix. I mean, they have TVs at every booth. How awesome is that? You have the ability to put on any game you want without asking for help.   Atmosphere-wise, think a neighborhood bar with mainly a younger client base, combined with a fair amount of interesting folks from all walks of life.   On top of the relaxed atmosphere, the quiz master that's there on Wednesdays and Fridays is entertaining, organized, and well-prepared. We try to go every Friday for their trivia night. He makes playlists of songs by length to time the rounds, which adds a nice vibe to the place. The food won't blow your brains out, but it's reliable, which is all I really require of bar food. The drink specials are pretty good too. Plus, everyone who works there is really attentive and sweet, and if Claudia is working she'll make sure you're taken care of, even if you're not one of her tables. :)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! We came here to hang out after dinner and to catch the second half of trivia. I'd never heard of places with Friday night trivia so that was cool.  I also really loved how they had pool and shuffleboard. I could totally play shuffleboard for hours, and even though we didn't sit at the booths, I noticed that they all had their own TVs - how convenient!  We ordered a bunch of beers and drinks - no food. The servers were so nice, they brought us extra waters to keep us hydrated. The beers were HUGE!  Overall, this place has a lot going for them and we had a great time!"}
{"text":"Went here to watch two sporting events the other night (Oakland A's (loss to Detroit in game 5)) as well as Thursday night football.  This is a perfect venue to do these things. My server Angie was great.  Checking on me enough to make me feel wanted, but not so much to make me feel like she wanted me to get the hell out of her booth.   I ordered the chipotle meatloaf was a little weird tasting, but then again I've never had chipotle meatloaf, so maybe that is how it is supposed to be.  I wanted to try the mac and cheese (which for some reason is not listed on their menu which appears on their website) but unfortunately they were out. Every booth has a TV, and I love you for that I will be back again for that.  The wifi is very fast, and allowed me to pull out my laptop and get some work done while visiting Phoenix.  The staff was very friendly, which I did not always experience during my previous visits to Hazelwood's.   However, I have no idea why, on such a big sports night (also ASU football and Yankee's vs Baltimore playing that night) that you choose to do Trivia.  Yes there were some people there participating, but largely it just got in the way of watching sports."}
{"text":"This place is alright.  They have tons of TVs, with individual one's at the tables.  It's perfect for trying to catch all the games on Sundays.  The food and drinks are pretty cheap, but they're skimping on quality.  You get what you pay for here.  We had watered down screw drivers and a mess of hash browns and eggs thrown on a plate.  The waitress needed an attitude check too.  There are better sports bars around here, so I'm skipping this one."}
{"text":"The fried food is a little greasy but the pretzels are good. Little pricey for what it is but the time to go is during trivia! $12 for a pretzel but awesome service!  Bunch of pitchers are fun for a trivia group. The food is pretty yummy especially after a few."}
{"text":"This place is a total sports dive... that can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on who you ask. This place boasts decent bar food (I like the burgers and the suicide wings), a STOCKED build your own bloody mary bar on sundays, and some of the wierdest regulars you'll ever run into anywhere. On any given night they have CHEAP specials on 32oz drafts... can't go wrong with that!  Not much really to set the place apart from any other sports bars... pool table, Golden Tee machine, TV's everywhere... Go for the experience and decide for yourself how you feel about this place!"}
{"text":"This place gets 4 stars from me for 1 reason only...CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP CH CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP drinks!!!  Drink specials like whoa!  Hell yeah!  And isn't that why one goes to a sports bar anyways?  Maybe that's just me but I doubt it.  Furthermore, I contemplated grand theft for the first time in a long time after seeing all of their TVs.  HD as far as the eye could see, 60+ inches everywhere, it was truly a sports fan's paradise.  I was afflicted with serious TV envy when I realized how much they dwarfed my TVs at home.  Their happy hour specials were awesome, $6.50 BIG domestic pitchers that served at least 4 full pint glasses, 4 sliders for $2.50 that were of WAY too much for me to eat on my own, $5 personal 1 topping pizzas, and an attentive wait staff that could have probably been around a bit more but definitely wasn't MIA by any stretch of the word.  Look, I could sit here and tell you the food was gourmet, but I'd be lying.  It's a sports bar and we have to be realistic.  If I were you, other than the drinks of course, I would go for the wings.  They were super cheap as well and definitely the strongest part of our meal.  Oh, and the curly fries were delicious :)  I was teetering around the 3 and a half star point until I went in the bathroom and saw that they had Team Trivia contests 2 separate nights a week and Karaoke another 2 nights...SOLD!  Great place to catch happy hour and watch a game, but wouldn't stray too far off the beaten path of normal bar cuisine, could get a little iffy.  I will definitely be back, my friends and I all had a great time."}
{"text":"3 Words: Worst. Service. Ever.   I'm usually pretty tolerable about less-than-stellar service, but this place takes it to a new low. I met some fellow Yelpers for our book club meeting. I was there a few minutes later than most of the group so they had drinks already. Our waitress came right over and took my drink order - a water to start. We all started talking about the book so we were a little slow to get a food order together. She came over and asked a few times and we finally ordered. We had probably been there 30 minutes at that point.   It takes a good while for the food to come out and we don't really get much drink service in the meantime. She might ask one person (they probably had to flag her down) and then would leave without checking with anyone else at the table. I was able to somehow convince her to bring me a pint of Fat Tire. Not sure how that worked out. Although, someone ordered a shot and was brought out not really what he ordered. When the food comes she brings two other people's order, but not mine. I figured she couldn't hold them all or it was a few minutes behind. We don't really see her for another 30 minutes or so. We finally flag her down and I ask her to cancel my order. She looked all surprised and seemed like she tried to blame it on some guy. No apology, no nothing.   We received crappy service the remainder of our visit. We asked for separate checks and she brought over one long bill. One gal took it up to who we think is the manager and asked it to be split out. We ended up getting separate checks, but my drink and another girl's fries were on the same bill. Really? Ugh. Not a big deal in the grand scheme of things, but was just the gross maraschino cherry on the top of a melted sundae.   Yeah, the Olympic hockey final was on, but it wasn't busy at all before that and we still had bad service. We determined they don't like blondes. I'll pick a better sports bar before I color my hair. =)   Recap: Worst. Service. Ever."}
{"text":"Now this place is fun!! Typical old school sorts bar with what looked to be amazing sports bar type food. Stopped in for a beer or two at this classic. Enjoyed 2 great IPA's, played a bit of trivia and admired this fun place. Saw dishes coming to the bar for other patrons. The Cheesesteak looked really good as did the giant pretzel. Lots of space. 3 rooms. memorabilia from Dbacks etc. One really cool thing I had never seen before is a metal rail atop the bar that is refrigerated. Place your bottle or mug there and it stays icy cold!!  Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Really enjoy going on for live trivia.  This place knows how to bring out fun and smart people at the same time.  Football season is starting so if you can't catch your team on the tv.  Every booth has its own tv with its own volume."}
{"text":"I came here for the book club yesterday, and I can't say that I will be back  any time soon.  The afternoon started off well, but ended in a general distaste for this place.  When I first got there, there was hardly anyone at the resturant, and it seemed like we got loads of attention from our server.  She was always coming over to us to bug us to order something.  I honestly wasn't that hungry, but I felt like I should order something, since the waitress kept coming over.   I ordered the American hot dog plate, and got fries and my coke to go with it.    Eventually every one else ordered, but one girls sliders order completely got ignored and never delivered.  When she mentioned something to the server, she seemed as surprised as we were.  It seems like after I food got delivered, that's when things went downhill.  For starters, the place got packed with people watching the USA/Canada hockey game, but I feel like maybe we got forgotten.  So much so, that I had to ask a manager to get our bill for us.  I also told him that we haven't seen or heard from our server in almost an hour.  then, when the bill DID finally come, we had to send it back to get split so we could all play our share.  I know its a sports bar, but it really lacked in service.  I think our table really felt ignored after while, with no drink refills, and having to flag down servers to even get our bill.  I don't plan on returning, as I was neither impressed with the food nor the service."}
{"text":"the wings are decent but it is always crowded. i don't mind that but the waitresses are overwhelmed many times."}
{"text":"Sometimes a place like this is not too bad to hang out at.   It's your typical sports bar.  Greasy fried food.  Big patio for all you damn smokers. Very average cover band(s). The music I heard was AC/DC, to Van Halen then to Metalica.   That's about it, just a bar to go have a drink at and get some greasy food."}
{"text":"We sure will miss Danny! He was really inspiring us to come back outside of one weekend morning a week.  ...Bummed! Were looking forward to new menu, special items he cooks himself and more creative music nights! Eventually we may just have to stop coming here...for certain if Jess ever leaves or gets fired like all the awesome mangers that have  tried to make this place fun. Dear Owner, Im NOT a fan of you.  This move takes you from 5 stars to 1 in my book.  It's common knowledge that  patrons return because of the people that make the place...bartenders, managers etc. So if one has common sense, it   seems  that this would be taken into great consideration prior to firing a superior individual who personally dedicate himself to a business.   The best bars find systems, great crew and keep them in place.  People come here for the people, not just the TVs. Even a church is just a building without the people.     Sadness and disgust  overwhelms the bar today by many of us who without explanation feel a good man was fired for no reason other than the bar owner must have been experiencing an emotionally unstable moment and is therefore driven towards sabotage.  The owners rep as a tyrant is all too well known but not understood or respected.  :("}
{"text":"I go for the trivia and for the grilled wings.   First of all, I always expect to pay more for all drummies, the price for all drummies here isn't bad by any means.  The problem is that they charge you to have the wings grilled as well!  I've never seen that happen before.   Service is what you would expect from a bar, not bad but not spectacular in any way.  They have terrible beer specials. You save maybe fifty cents for their beer specials.  Only reason I go here is because its a central meeting spot with friends.  If you can overcome the price gouging for their items (ie they charge you for extra sauce on anything), it's not such a bad place. I like them better than Zipps."}
{"text":"I like the bar but the service was WAY below par ... I was going to go across the street to Zipps but it was too crowded so I decided to try Hazelwoods.  I had a friend with me that told me he had received poor service the 2 times he had been there before .... seems to be a pattern.  It was busy so I can excuse  slow service  (definitely should have had 2 bartenders) but I cannot excuse poor attitudes from servers/bartenders. Not sure if I will be back which is a shame because I liked the layout and atmosphere.  Very curious why so few servers and only one bartender on a NFL Playoff Sunday!!!"}
{"text":"I was ridiculously drunk by the time I came here. All I remember was:  1. a huge foam football helmet on some douche bag 2. pizza so oily it oozed out 3. wings that didn't taste spicy or sweet 4. Arizona college decals in the bathroom 5. Arizona losing to UCLA  Oh, and there was a huge football size scrolling marquee on the front. Unnecessary. Well, it was free because my buddy paid but other than that, I don't think i want to ever go back. At least there is no smoking in Arizona now."}
{"text":"My recent addiction to NTN Trivia led me here last night. After hearing they have tvs in the booths I was on a mission.   The place is kind of reminiscent of my time working in real estate. It is a meeting place for 50's male sporto guys that drink too much, make gestures at the girls, and think beef strogonoff is gods gift to man. You know the type I'm talking about. This place was full of them... I'm sure at least 75% had subscriptions to every sports package on TV and every lolita porn site on the internet. I just ignored them, and I wasn't bothered. There was a girl in the corner dancing to Jay Z with her hands in the air and shaking her ass.... she was roughly 50 and white.   The entire bar is covered in sporto stuff from the sport ball carpet, to the logos and memorabilia everywhere. Think Dustin Hoffman's room at the asylum in Rainman, but with soccer ball carpet. There are a ton of tvs everywhere, including your own if you get a booth. They have foosball, pool, darts, and shuffleboard to keep you entertained which is great. They have a nice patio too, unfortunately so many people smoke on it you can hardly breathe.  I liked their menu as it was extremely varied. I ordered the Sweet Chili Wings and was amazed at how many I got for $5.95 and they were pretty big tasty wings too. Also at the table was a cheeseburger that looked good until my girlfriend proceeded to take all the veggies off and put a pound of ketchup on it, slice it in half, and then rip the halfs in half with her hands. Weirdo.   After dinner we sat drinking beers and playing trivia until almost 2am and were never rushed or made to feel like we should turn the table. The service was not good by any means but they were at least welcoming.   I'll go back here. It wasn't an amazing experience, but it is definitely a fun place with at least decent food."}
{"text":"Yes, just about every free-standing bar (meaning one that's not part of a hotel or something) tries to claim sports-bar status by littering their walls with big-screen TV's and tuning each to some different game. Well . . . see . . . anyone can do that, which is why it's popular. To make a REAL sports bar you need a management who develops sports as the raison d'etre of the place itself. And yes, I just used a fancy French phrase to philosophize about a sports bar.  Hazelwood's not only has large TV's on almost every vertical surface, they have TV's at every booth, just like truck stops in the old days had mini-jukeboxes.   Hazelwood's has good bar-fare at good prices on their menu, but also impressive specials that are only in effect during games. One of their beer specials when I visited was Widmer Hefeweizen. How often do you see that on special in other places?  Hazelwoods's not only welcomes local amateur sports teams, they sponsor a few, like the local rugby guys.  Hazelwoods will not only call you a cab if you over-imbibe, they also will shuttle you home in their own shuttle craft for free within a reasonable distance. This is putting their money within reasonable distance of their mouth, if you ask me.  But what is most important--and is most likely a result of the policies and features above--is the customer base. When I go into a sports bar and sit at the bar I want the guys next to me--strangers who just happen to be sitting there--to occasionally lean over and say in breathless excitement while staring me in the eye \"THE DIFFERENCE IN TIME OF POSSESSION IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE GAME WAS LESS THAN 5 MINUTES BETWEEN NEW YORK AND INDY!\" Seriously, this is important to me because just as people in a dancing bar should be fully involved with dancing, people in a sports bar should be fully involved with sports. And I find such running commentary helpful because I basically don't know shit about football.  Also, on the night I was there the rugby players were entertaining the whole bar with their profane gang-sings about necrophilia and such. This further contributed to the integrity of the impression. This is a sports bar full of sporty people.  So yes, Hazelwood's is a success and deservedly so. This is a SPORTS BAR. It's not an Applebee's, nor is it a dive with a lot of TV's. If you enjoy the spirit of the rabid spectator and can share the excitement of those who thrill to vicarious participation, you should go to this place."}
{"text":"That's one hell of a big burger - and for only 9.99!!! 2lbs of freaking beef and and 10\" burger is what results... bring a couple friends to get this thing down.  Large outdoor well-misted patio, \"coldest beer in town\", Karaoke on Tuesdays and Saturdays, interesting crowd. Old-school sports bar atmosphere."}
{"text":"I came for the NTN Trivia but stayed for just about everything else. The staff is great, they've been accommodating with my sports choices (namely the Blackhawks), the beer's cold, and the prices are good.   My only complaint was the garlic fries. I don't recommend them."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar with good drink specials and friendly staff (especially Angie). Trivia on Wednesdays is always a good time and the pretzel, nachos, and wings are delicious to mention a few."}
{"text":"My friends and I went to Hazelwoods for two reasons, friday trivia and my friend's birthday.  I wouldn't say that this was the most amazing place ever but...  I found the service to be accommodating.  I was there on friday for a friend's birthday.    It's almost impossible to eat healthily at a sports bar, and the salads on the menu weren't exactly the best.  So I asked for a salad that was off menu.  I asked for a mixed greens salads with all the veggies they had available, a grilled chicken breast.  Since I'm a fan of chicken wings, I also asked for a side of buffalo sauce, and some blue cheese to go with.  The salad was great, and exactly what I wanted.  I hope they would put it on the menu.... just saying... :)  Some other comments about the food.... the fried pickles weren't that great.  The \"breading\" didn't stay on the pickle and it was hard to cut.  They were in quarters and I wish that it was more bite sized.  Sweet potato tater tots are always amazing, and that pretzel cheese sauce was on the spicy side."}
{"text":"I went to watch the UFC fights Brock vs. Cain.  First thing I was caught off guard at was $5 cover to get in.  They did offer prizes which included alcohol in a raffle so that was fine.  One major thing was they wouldn't include it in my tab I had to use the ATM which cost me some more money.  Lucky for me I got there early so I got a table that I could see 3 TV's from.    So on to the food and drink.  I had a 25 oz Dos Equis Lager for $4 which was the special not bad to start out with.  I put in an order for half of a dozen hot wings.  I was really unimpressed with the wings.  They seemed over cooked and there was barely any sauce on them.   I would expect the hot wings to be hot but no they weren't.    So overall a good place to watch the fight as the crowd is into it.  I will have to try other things I hear the burgers are good.  Also remember to bring cash for the cover."}
{"text":"Okay, so if you're looking for a real sports bar in Arcadia you've found it. It's totally a man's bar and one of those places you feel silly ordering a martini or glass of wine but that's what is great about it. You've got shuffle board and pool and TVs and a menu that will make any lover of fried food super happy. I mean, it even has one of those machines that you blow into to find out your blood alcohol level... need I say more?"}
{"text":"I've got two words for you: trivia night! Hazelwood's is the place to be for trivia night! It's sooooooooo much fun! The food portions are ridiculously huge, so are the drinks, and playing the game is free! If you're not a smoker, the down side is that smoking is allowed on the patio =( On the upside, there is a flatscreen tv in every booth and even more holstered to every square inch of the walls throughout the bar - all of which are tuned in to local and nationally televised sporting events! So, long story short: if you're looking for a place to get together with friends for some inexpensive (yet tasty) food, and some kick-ass trivia ... then take your butt over to Hazelwoods! (Just don't sit in my booth!)"}
{"text":"Best grilled wings in town, best soft pretzel in the world and some of the best servers in Phoenix.   Love this place ! While it's not much to look at-the food and service are always great.   Sort of an odd bathroom remodel lately though in the guys room.   Also some of the locals in this bar are creepy losers so don't get too cozy with them- just bring your friends with you and have a good time on your own."}
{"text":"My friends and I started coming to Hazelwoods for their Thursday night trivia and always have a blast!  Not only do they have a great happy hour but they also have nightly drink specials depending on the day of the week.  Besides Team Trivia, they also organize card games on specific nights (sorry I'm not sure what kind though).  I also love their beer selection, 16 beers on tap!  For being a dive bar, they also have pretty good food.  My friends and I always end up ordering the Pretzel with spicy cheese dip!  It is a very large portion and comes hot and buttery from the oven.  I also love their 1st place burger which is HUGE at a  1/2 pound!  You can even add another burger patty on to make it a full lb but the regular burger is more than enough for me.  The main down falls is that they nickel and dime you on some items.  Adding cheese to the sliders or the burger is going to set you back $1, sometimes the server will tell you and most times they won't.  Also I have asked for ranch dressing in place of some sauces the appetizer comes with and I still charged $0.50 for \"extra dressing,\" even though I don't get the sauce AND the dressing.  Service can be hit and miss as well.  I've had a server one time that was very short with our table but then another night, the same server joked and had a good time with us.    All in all, if you are looking for a chill place to hang out with your friends and watch the game that has cheap beer and decent food, Hazelwoods is your place!"}
{"text":"Great for pizza & wings...hot, honey garlic wings are very good. Neighborhood fave for locals. Friendly staff. Great place to go watch a game."}
{"text":"I was treated poorly by staff in my first interaction with this establishment but applaud ownership for showing an effort to resolve the mistreatment. I have not been back since but the fact that ownership takes an active role in customer relations is noble."}
{"text":"This place is so close to my house, it's hard not to go here. The food is average but the service is usually great. I never have to wait too long for food or drink. They have trivia a few nights a week. There is a different beer special daily, otherwise the beers are all reasonably priced. The best thing on the entire menu is the pretzel and the beer cheese it comes with. The onion rings are also good as they are not frozen and they make them fresh. Also - the booths all have their own tv's in them so you can watch whatever game you want (in addition to the flat screen tv's all over)."}
{"text":"With the addition of allowing dogs on the patio-Hazelwoods has gone back up to 4 stars in my book!   Since I'm a crazy dog lady, I almost always have a dog with me, and now that I'm trying to eat healthier, I'm trying to avoid drive-throughs.  Hazelwoods has a couple of giant and amazing salads, great specials on big beers, and they bring a water bowl for the dog!  Oh, and say hi to Angie.  She's my neighbor's sister in law, and she is AWESOME. :)"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of sports/sports bars, but I really liked Hazelwoods. We came with a few friends on a Friday night and played team trivia - even took third place and won a $10 gift cert!  We didn't eat, so I can't comment on the food, but we got lots of rounds of drinks and the service was pretty good. They carry Ace Pear Cider in bottles for those of us that are gluten free, which was a nice surprise.   The hands down best thing was finding out that they had a FREE shuttle service both TO and FROM the bar! I was going to be the DD for the night, but quickly scrapped that idea and got a ride home at the end of the night."}
{"text":"WOW The land of a thousand HD televisons! This is a sports bar located in the heart of Phoenix at 36th street and Indian School rd.  It does not disapoint when it comes to televising the big games!  They have EVERY sports package imagninable all throughout the year and even sponsor a local rugby team to boot!  The food isnt bad for sports bar fare, the beer is ICE cold and for an older central phoenix building this place is really well maintained.  Only three stars because the only local beer they have on tap is 4Peaks KiltLifter, a beer that can be had at Fiesta Mall Red Lobster, kinda missing the point right?  A good place to visit for really cold beer and that all important scoreline when ih the city of Phoenix."}
{"text":"One time visitors from out of town on a Saturday night.  Good crowd of regulars.  Not pretentious or touristy as the Scottsdale Rd bars; more of a working Joe & Josephine's bar.  Reasonable prices.  Karaoke was fun.  Had NTN trivia.  UFC on plenty of screens.  Outdoor patio featuring bands on certain nights.  Only complaint was the waitress did seem to pass by many times when the beer mugs were low or empty."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Hazelwoods for years!   I love the Greek Salad. But they never seem to put enough red onions on the salad. I always have to ask for extra red onions. (that's just my opinion) The Ruben Sandwich is very yummy! If you like sauerkraut, they put extra on this sandwich.   Now, I've never had one of their burgers until last night. I seriously think I hurt myself! We started off the night with a $5 Kiltlifter mug and then ordered dinner. The 1st Place Burger and french fries was a big helping! I was able to eat 90% of my plate! Since I live 100 yards from Hazelwoods we always walk. The walk home was hurtful! I don't think I'll have the burger again. It was delicious don't me wrong, it was just too much for me.   On another note, Hazelwoods has some of the best Garlic Chicken Wings around! I defiantly recommend Hazelwoods to any and everyone!"}
{"text":"Came for the afternoon football games, waited 45 minutes until a waitress finally passed our table and informed us that there was a large party outside and they were to busy to help us, go to Zipps across the street instead, much better service there"}
{"text":"I wouldn't consider myself an old timer or regular here but have been here more than five times under 10 in the the last four five years. It's been a cool chill spot for trivia and basic bar food. Get some wings and the Sonoran burger before they close in the end of may. This corner has become rather bougie (legit Arcadia vibe) in the last few year's so coo chill dive bars can't/won't last. I never met the owners but has always been a quality experience. From the karaoke nights on patio to bar trivia. Definitely curious to what will be next here."}
{"text":"lets face it 3 stars is all it gets because it was A-OK. not exactly the place i would intentionally travel to. way outside my zone of travel.  i tried the hot wings, style Hot. the flavor was good, the heat was good.  they gave me the option of Blue Cheese or Ranch, i chose ranch because i do not like Blue Cheese. they also gave me a serving of honey mustard..which may be normal. i'm confused because the serviing of honey mustard dwarfed the serving of Ranch, which is a typical side for Hot Wings. overall the wings were good, spicy and crunchy. ranch and Honey Mustard complimented the Spicy Hot sauce of the \"Hot\" Wings.   i spent 40 bucks with Tip for 2 people drinking througout the cardinals semi finals vs. Carolina. much surprised by the conclusion. i figured choke was on the menu...but no.  the outside Patio area is expansive, which is nice to see for a bar. smokers have received very little respect...and smokers used to be the bread and butter for bars. as we usually drink more as we smoke.  but they have added booth style seating to the outside patio which is now partially inclosed by clear plastic sheeting to enclose the patio area.  if i lived in the area i could see this being my neighborhood watering hole...but since i do not live in the area..i will keep the Roosevelt as my local watering hole..despite the obvious contrast between the two bars.  Hazelwood's, thank you for being my 100th review."}
