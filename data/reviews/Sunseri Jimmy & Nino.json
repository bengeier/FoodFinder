{"text":"Ask Mr. Sunseri for his recommendations and you'll leave with a bag of the best Italian imported food in the city! Great quality foods and always fresh. FANTASTIC place to shop!"}
{"text":"The italian coldcut sub was a travesty! Lots of STALE bread with skimpy meat portions, and no hots or flavor. Bread better suited for pigeons than people. I can find better Italian sandwiches back home in Baltimore. We'll feed these to our dogs when we get home.  You get what you pay for. Avoid this tourist trap!"}
{"text":"The pepperoni roll on a Saturday stroll in the strip is the stuff dreams are made of. Add in the guy working the stall smoking a cigarette and joking with North Hills house wife's about sampling his spicy roll and you've got and unbeatable steel city moment."}
{"text":"Man I wish we had a place like this in Phoenix.. Visited the burgh this past week and found this little gem in the strip district, let me just say the atomic pepperoni roll is on point. Also try and go on the weekend as there's more to offer on those days (salt sticks). Jimmy and Nino are two stand up guys as well. Needless to say I look forward to my next trip back to Pittsburgh strictly because of this place."}
{"text":"Every Time we are n pittsburgh we go here to get our italian sausage...They do and incredible job...and the customer service is hands down fantastic...."}
{"text":"The best cannoli, hands down! The ricotta is super fresh, it is incredibly flavorful, and they wait to fill the shell until you order it. Whenever we are in Pittsburgh, I insist we stop by! Today, I also got the atomic pepperoni roll which was incredible! Super fresh and flavorful dough. It has a peppery spread with the pepperoni on the inside. The bread became a little wet on the bottom, but is very good after being toasted! Love this place and the history it embodies from the Strip!"}
{"text":"Get your deli meats here.  Small but where you need to go when you need good quality food and honest answers.  Can't go wrong here looking for weekly needs or special party needs.  We used to stop every Saturday when we lived in the city.  Now we stop every trip to the strip.  Don't miss out!  Good stuff and this is coming from a PSU fan!  Can't believe I am saying this.  Forget your collegiate boundaries when it comes to good food!   Keep puffin Jimmy and Nino and we'll keep buying!"}
{"text":"Had a sub here for lunch yesterday.  Cheesesteak.  Boy oh boy was THAT thing good.  If the rest of their food is as good as their subs then I will definitely have to go back."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are great, as are the bakery items. The sfogliatelle is spot on."}
{"text":"Every time I am in town, I get a regular and an atomic pepperoni roll to bring back to California.  I even have a friend who ships them to me a couple of times a year.  The dipping peppers, the bread, the meatball subs...the whole experience...what can I say?  This is Pittsburgh in a tiny Strip District storefront."}
{"text":"Completely agree with Deborah: decent sandwich on absolutely horrible bread - mealy tomato and brown lettuce, too.  I know it was only $4/$7 for a 6\"/12\" sub, but it was pretty bad.  (I bought a 12\", intending to take half home for later, but I wound up throwing the second half away, and I NEVER throw away food.)  

As a Italian grocery, it seems okay, but the attitudes are a little snippy, and it's a pretty grungy-looking place."}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service. I'm from Scranton, another area known for good Italian food, but whenever I'm in town I try to get to Sunseri's. I love their bread. The atomic pepperoni rolls, regular pepperoni rolls, and the pepperoni and cheddar rolls are definitely favorites. And then you add the meats and friendly service, and it's definitely worth a trip to the Strip District by itself."}
{"text":"Great little Italian store down in the strip,  2nd best meatballs in the immediate area, and they make a great meatball sandwich, along with sausage sandwiches, pizza slices, and a host of other hot foods. These I believe are available mostly in the lunch time hours on the weekdays and most of the day on the weekends. Good food for a good price, featuring a deli counter for meats and cheese, sliced and by the pound, a nice selection of sausages, and a wonderful refrigerated pre cooked meals cooler, lasagna, meatballs, sausages in red sauce are among the stand outs. Worth a visit for sure, also, on the weekends they hawk pepperoni rolls out front on the sidewalk, though I've never gotten the whole pepperoni roll thing, if you dig it, there you go!. One misleading thing about the place, is that a sign out front advertises Chinese food by the pound, yet the staff knew nothing about it, I suspect some midnight prankster had stuck the sign up there under the cover of darkness as some sort of sick prank, hats off to you mysterious monkey wrencher"}
{"text":"This place is the deli you have always dreamed about.  The sights, the smells, the tastes...  Delicious!  The fresh bread is amazing, the stuffed pizzelle's are very good and my wife thinks they have the best cannoli's in Pittsburgh.  Stop in & talk to Jimmy and ask him about Stella the parrot.  This place is a 'must-see' every time we're in the strip."}
{"text":"I've been going here ever since I was a kid and it's awesome! You gotta get the pepperoni roll!!"}
{"text":"Don't go if you want a nice dining environment.  To say the furnishings in the dining area are spartan would be an understatement.
But, the food is fantastic.  Fresh made, fairly priced, and delicious.  Get a dessert cookie or cannoli to round out your lunch.  
I hit this place every time I'm in Pittsburgh.  Everyone hears about Primanti's (which is good, dont get me wrong), but this place is every bit as good."}
{"text":"This is one of my staples whenever I visit the Strip District.  Sunseri's offers you lots of cold cuts, cheeses and pre-made hot italian food.  In addition, they offer fresh bread, olives and a small assortment of baked goods.  They also have a cooler that has some more cheeses, pre-cut italian cold-cuts (pepperoni) and the famous \"Jimmy & Nino's Legendary Dipping Peppers.\"  Not sure what is in these peppers, but I love them.

My favorite thing to get there, in addition to the Dipping Peppers are the Pepperoni Rolls.  These are fantastic, freshly baked, with ample pepperoni.  They have the best capicola, mortadella (with and without the pistachios) and salami that I have found in the city.  They do have great sausage, both sweet and hot, here as well that we usually get for homemade ravioli.

The staff is always very friendly to us whenever we are in there, even when it is really crowded.  On days when the place is empty, they are always willing to chat you up about anything, but in particular italian food.  Jimmy is always there and chomping on his stogie.  He is really interesting for sure and always good to talk with. 

I highly recommend stopping hear anytime you are in the mood for good italian food."}
{"text":"I always had a good experience eating here for lunch.  Yea it is a bit run down, but name some in the strip that aren't?  They have $5.00 lunch specials and Jimmy was always very nice and the huge stogies in his mouth just took me back.  Funny.. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"$3.00 fresh baked Italian loaf, need I say more.  The Italian bread is so yummy and makes great bruschetta.  They bake their bread fresh daily and do not include any preservative so eat it quick!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the prices - normally, specialty Italian stores are ridiculously overpriced. Not this store. Reasonable, fresh meat, cheese, and olives (great kalamata olives! i stocked up). As for the pepperoni roll, it was a decent, filling meal - the bread was chewy and fresh."}
{"text":"Us New Yorkers try to stick to the four main food groups; garlic bread, pizza bread, fresh bread, and cheesy breads!

There breads are yummy! i finish TWO twelve inch pizza bread in less then a day! and that says a lot since i don't usually eat that much bread...

Yes bread is fresh! they are made fresh everyday! Breads have very short shelf life max 3-4 days if stored in room temperatures...an hour or two before the shop is closed they tend to sell all their breads half price or buy one get one free...Sunseri Jimmy & Nino go for natural ingredients some bakeries add artificial flavors, colors and ingredients...not this place! delish!"}
{"text":"Best meatballs in town, plus the pepperoni rolls can't be beat. Grab a sandwich and seat outside and enjoy The Strip experience. Thanks Jimmy for delicious food!"}
{"text":"Pittsburgh Bound!  Part X

(For Part IX, go to: http://www.yelp.com/biz/stamoolis-brothers-company-pittsburgh?hrid=8hA8rRHss2PRlroWujzT_Q)

The Sunseri name is famous in Pittsburgh, and although their small alcove of Italian meats and bread is one of the smaller storefronts in the Strip, their pepperoni bread is melt in your mouth, filled with great mozzarella cheese.  I grabbed a loaf and we picked at it while we walked around.  My mom and I inhaled half of it without blinking an eye.

If you are going to get a loaf of Sunseri's pepperoni bread, I would suggest not doing it on an empty stomach.

(For Part XI, go to: http://www.yelp.com/biz/primanti-brothers-pittsburgh?hrid=k97SGRvnhBMrHzqofs1WNg)"}
{"text":"This place offers the best pepperoni roll around. To be honest I've never been inside; I usually just grab a loaf at the sidewalk stand in passing. This is a much more meat-and-cheese filled loaf than the Mancini's counterpart, which definitely is filled out with bread.

I've occasionally had a few of their other breads, including sourdough and cheesy jalepeno. They're all tasty and reasonably priced, but the pepperoni roll is always king."}
{"text":"We ordered an Atomic Pepperoni roll. The guy gave us a sample and we loved it. It is a basic pepperoni roll with different kind of peppers in it. For an entire roll, it is $8 ($6 for just  pepperoni)

$8 fed 2 people and we took a lot home as well.

Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The BEST pepperoni and atomic pepperoni rolls ever!  AMAZING dipping peppers! SUPER friendly and charasmatic!  Entire atmosphere and the way they talk to you, you feel like part of the italian family!!

LOVE THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"This place has the most heavenly smell!

The pepperoni bread is an absolute must.  I was disappointed that there was no jalapeno bread left, but what can I do?  The prices are fantastic.  $5 for a full loaf of pepperoni bread, in NYC that's easily $8 to $12.  I will stop here before going home every time."}
{"text":"Pepperoni roll for breakfast on Thanksgiving is a damn awesome thing."}
{"text":"Great inexpensive sandwiches that are perfect sized for lunch. I go to Jimmy and Nino's often to get an eggplant and meatball sub. I highly recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"I need to indulge myself on the rest of this establishment but review is limited to the bread they sell on the street.  On a crowded street you will find a very funny bread-salesmen gunning for your attention to be focused on the racks of bread loafs behind him.  Well sir, you are in fact an excellent and carney-esque salesman but you need not do much.  The aroma emanating from the bread itself on a busy street is enough.  Goodness is the smell of freshly baked bread amazing.  And this place has a few standard options and some excellent \"different\" options.  The cheesey jalapeno bread was incredibly delicious.  However, my favorite selection of the day was the freshly dressed (I want to say with some fresh tomato sauce and basil) toasted  bread.  WOW!"}
{"text":"Everyone talks about Mancini's pepperoni roll. Clearly, they haven't tried Sunseri's. For $5-6, you get a pepperoni roll 2-3x the size. The pepperoni is high quality and dough delicious. Don't forget to get a side of their homemade marinara sauce for dipping. You - and your 2-3 best friends - are in for a real treat."}
{"text":"I have stopped by here 3 times within the past 2 months, each time with my fiance.  The first time that we stopped was on a Sunday morning when the cart came into view with all of its nice looking breads.  I have walked by the cart and store many times before without really stopping to check it out.  That day we decided to though since I was hungry and did not want a full meal and boy am I glad that we did.  Originally I was just going to get one of the loaves of bread to have a bit then and save for later but then I noticed some true french bread pizza (aka pizza toppings on top of a slice of french bread) which I ended up getting.  While I was ordering that my fiance noticed some Sfogliatelle and she ended up ordering one of those as well.  I think the total cost was $3 and Jimmy told us the story of how the sfogliatelle was created while chomping on his cigar.  Both of our items were good and both my fiance and I were espcially impressed with the sfogliatelle.  It had a lot more filling than we are used to getting as well as a more orangy flavor which made it extra good.  Honeslty she was just happy to find a good Sfogliatelle in Pittsburgh.  She is Italian and is used to getting them with some family members at some Italian bakeries in NYC.  The second time that we came here was once again at the cart on a Sunday when Jimmy enticed us with sfogliatelle that was fresh out of the oven and still warm.  Finally the last time that we came was on a Saturday and so the whole store was open, not just the cart.  It was interesting to look around inside and see everything that I had been missing by walking past it all of these years. There were a number of display cases with a ton of baked goods in each of them and it also looked like they served a bunch of different lunch type items like sandwiches to go.  Jimmy once again waited on us and as always was super friendly and told us some stories that we enjoyed.  We ended up leaving this time with not only sfogliatelle for my fiance but also for her parents.

The bottom line for me is that I will definitely be back here again in the future.  Everything that I have ever ordered here has been good and it is always fun to talk with Jimmy!"}
{"text":"I was treated extra special today at Jimmy & Nino Sunseri's in the Strip
Thank you so much, I feel great!"}
{"text":"Walking by Sunseri's in the Strip District is nearly impossible to do without stopping by to get one of their pepperoni rolls. When I say they are legendary, I really mean it! They have regular ones filled with  pepperoni and cheese, but they also have \"atomic\" ones if you like things on the spicier side.

I'm not sure who is a bigger fan of Sunseri's between my mom and I, but she doesn't live in the city and frequently sends me on trips to get her pepperoni rolls. I've braved some pretty harsh weather conditions to get them for her, and if they weren't as good as they are I might think twice about making the journey. They are 2/$10 for the regular or $6 each, and 2/$15 for the atomic or $8 each. Carrying more than 2 pepperoni rolls is comparable to carrying a small child with as big as they are, so you seriously get a bang for your buck here.

During my last visit I was a bit under the weather and decided to try some of their famous wedding soup. You can get frozen quarts of the soup for around $5, and combined with a pepperoni roll you have a tasty and filling meal for less than $15! Usually I'm wary about trying new wedding soups out of fear of being disappointed, but Sunseri's had chopped chicken and little meatballs with one of the best broths I've tasted (aside from homemade, that is). 

You can't go wrong with whatever you choose here, and I'd love to try other items including their sausage and other Italian classics. Stop by Sunseri's next time you're in the strip, and you may even meet Mr. Sunseri himself as he frequently spends time around the shop, cigar-in-mouth and all!"}
{"text":"Maybe it's nostalgia for the cigar but I thought he looked ridiculous. He bragged about a $4 pepperoni roll. There's a reason it cost that, because it wasn't very good. The sauce was disappointing. I wouldn't come here for anything."}
{"text":"I came here as part of the Pittsburgh foodie tour and it was so lovely and an absolute privilege to actually hear from Jimmy Sunseri about the origins of his store. 

It's a lovely homey Italian herbs smell that you encounter when you walk in and I was corrected by Jimmy when I made such a comment that actually it's a Sicilian smell! I had the special of the shop, which is a pepperoni roll which for me, I got some pieces of bread that tasted a wee bit raw. But it was accompanied by the most deliciously lovely marinara sauce and I grabbed a spoon and ate gobfuls!

This place is a lovely bit of local colour in the Strip District and definitely step in to check it out and get the marinara sauce! Everyone in the store is super friendly and oh also if you want to use the loo, just ask a member of staff for the key! 

Yelp Review 64/2017"}
{"text":"I love pepperoni roll, and Suneri's pepperoni roll is literally the BEST EVER.

I always love the smell of fresh dough coming from Sunseri's when I walk through the Strip District. It draws me in every time. This shop is packed with tons of different foods to choose from. The pepperoni rolls are always my go-to item. It's only $8 for a gigantic pepperoni roll. My boyfriend and I got one and we were able to have leftovers as well! I have never had such amazing dough in my life, and there is the perfect ratio of pepperoni, cheese, and dough.

Sunseri's has tons of great food to check out, but seriously, at least stop in and grab a pepperoni roll. It is 100% worth it!"}
{"text":"The atomic pizza roll is phenomenal! Not as spicy as it sounds, and the flavor really pulls you in. A little heat from the peppers, a generpus portuon of pepperoni, mounds of cheese under a sweet layer of dough. Most definitely more meat, cheese, pepper then dough. Just how i like it ;)"}
{"text":"The Pepperoni Roll... can't beat it. Best in the 'Burgh. If you're wandering in the chaos of the Strip on a weekend morning, be sure to stop by and get a Pepperoni Roll, with marinara sauce to dip, they're usually selling them outside. 

They also have a room upstairs if you want to devour some right away, or just take it home and heat it up for a delicious game time snack."}
{"text":"Sunseri Jimmy & Nino is the perfect combination of Italian hospitality and convenience. Located on the strip, the outside of the store has bench and table seating. A man outside was offering samples of their pepperoni roll as he stood next to a large bakers rack full of fresh breads. A couple approached and he assembled two rolls for them on the spot. I overheard the girl saying that these were her favorite rolls of all time. 

My husband and I walked inside to check out the menu. They have anything from hoagies to lasagna. I got the eggplant and meatball sub with peppers and onions. My husband got the loaded Italian hoagie. While we waited for our food to be cooked we browsed the back part of the store. I have a major sweet tooth, so of course I was attracted to the display of fresh pastries they had. Towards the very back they have a selection of cheeses, herbs, spices, and oils. I didn't check out this area too much because I was too distracted by the sights and smells of the front of the store. 

The best part of all is that Jimmy himself sat in the store and talked to everyone in line. He sat in his red chair chewing on a cigar. You could tell this was a place where he had regulars and he knew almost everyone.

We got our food after waiting about 7 minutes. One of the workers even offered us a sample while we waited. My husband thought he got someone else's order. Two huge sandwiches came in his bag. He took it back to make sure and they said the order was correct. The amount of food you get for the price is better than any fast food place. We left full and satisfied unlike when you go to fast food. We definitely hope to go back soon."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Italian market in Pittsburgh.  I buy food from here almost every week.  It doesn't have the crazy selection (or crazy crowd) of Penn Mac, but what it does have is a serviceable meat and cheese counter, a good range of olive oils, a few different brands of canned tomatoes, nice pepperoni, and a tiny little produce section which is heavy on the peppers.  I usually get my pasta from here rather than Penn Mac.  They have a few different choices of brand, all of them decent, and you don't have to fight a hundred out-of-towners if you want something.  The people are friendly, and if you stop in frequently, they remember you (Penn Mac and a lot of the other stores are just too crowded for the level of fussing-over that you'll get here).  

Jimmy (the guy with the cigar permanently ensconced in his mouth) also makes fabulous pepperoni rolls and sandwiches.  We like to eat lunch here as a break during our grocery shopping.  During the warmer seasons, you should sit at the outside tables and people-watch, because you will see and hear some truly hilarious stuff (this is the place where I heard the guy from Hermanowski's corner store chatting with the nun selling raffle tickets about another nun, Sister Dominica or something similar, who had won $50 on the scratch-off lotto and blown it all on more scratch-off tickets).  There's also an upstairs dining room for when it gets colder out, though."}
{"text":"Weeeeeeellll, a little smaller than the deli up the street, a little less friendly, or should I say a little more fake in their friendliness.  Offerings still blow away any deli/grocery store offerings in the D.C. area.  But low rating because the sandwich I bought came on a roll that was STALE. Boo!  Hiss! Meat was excellent, though but without the bread I was left hungry and feeling let down."}
{"text":"So I love the meatballs and the pepperoni rolls so much. I mean so very much.
Also a great place to swing by for sandwiches. They have good subs for sure.
Everything is priced right with generous portions."}
