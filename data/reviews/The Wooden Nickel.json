{"text":"My husband, my son, and I had a wonderful experience at the Norwin Town Square Wooden Nickel. We used the 40% discount that came via email for dinner and used the 40% discount on a bottle of wine that was offered as a special for Saturday night.  This was our first visit and we were pleasantly surprised. The decor was lovely - elegant but not too fancy. We were seated in the dining room where you could see the food being prepared in the kitchen. It was a nice touch. We ordered the appetizer of calamari, which was very good. Dinner came with bread and seasoned oil and butter - very delicious. My husband and I ordered the stuffed pepper soup which was a bit spicy for me but my husband enjoyed it. My son had the Caesar salad which he said was delicious. We ordered the macaroni and cheese with shrimp and crab meat, the scallops dinner, and the swordfish as our three entr√©es. Everything was absolutely delicious! The scallops in particular, were out of this world delicious! We ordered the special for dessert which was blueberry cannolis served with chocolate ice cream - yummy. With our 40% discount off of our dinner and wine, our evening came to $85. Even without our discount I feel our bill was reasonable. Our service was flawless and we had a wonderful evening. It is great to have a restaurant like this, finally, in our community.  Do not let those complaining about the prices scare you off. You will enjoy yourself - and it's nice to not have to drive to downtown Pittsburgh for this kind of dining experience."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Horrible tasting food. \"Pasta\" is now rice. My filet tasted like Liver. The only thing that was good was my salad. If you are looking for a higher end dining experience there are many better places in the Pittsburgh Area to award with your business.  Or you could spend less and go to Denny's for better food."}
{"text":"The food is mediocre at best and the prices too high.  I knew this restaurant wouldn't last in this area."}
{"text":"Stay away.  Overpriced and underwhelming. $24 for a $4 Cornish hen, instant mash and frozen veggies.  I would be inclined to give a better review if the meal was great, but it wasn't. It was just ok.  The other meals at our table were similarly disappointing, portion and taste wise.  Decor is nice and the service was good, but can't make up for the lack of value.  Too many better restaurants in the Irwin area."}
{"text":"My family, party of 5, ate our Thanksgiving meal here this year, never again. The roasted turkey was great but $22 for instant potatoes and Stove top stuffing and ending with very cold pie was not my idea of a thanksgiving day feast out. Very disappointed. Our server however was very sweet."}
{"text":"Food is OK. Service is spotty at best. I would not mind the price point if the service and food was better. I doubt I will go there again. Tried it 3 times with less than a positive experience any of those visits."}
{"text":"We recently had an event here and had the worse demeaning experience due to the owners and management. First, we had a sit down luncheon and not only was the food late, there was a 20 minute delay between the time they served first table and last table. In addition, we paid for the non-alcoholic drink package and they never asked the guests what they would like to drink until we reminded them while we were eating. Secondly, we signed a contract several months ago and two weeks before the event they called to tell us they are raising our prices and gratuity prices. We tried to have a discussion with the main manager and owner explaining that we do not feel it's right to increase rates when we signed a contract. They kept saying we have the right to do this whether you think it's right or not. Finally the manager said he would pay for it out of his own pocket. What owner would even allow that?!? Of course we said thank you, we appreciate your consideration. Just then I watch the owner walk out, mouthing off about us to her private party. She was absolutely rude to us and called us trash. Then the manager went to some of our guests and told them, in his opinion, the groom (who asked for the consideration of the price change) is a jerk. So management and ownership is publicly talking about their guests. This is not how you treat your customers. So, beware if you book an event, even if you sign a contract, that means nothing to them. Neither does doing the right things right for your customers. I travel the country eating at the nicest, high-end restaurants and never experienced anything so awful. Oh did I say they ruined the brides shower? You need to get a little more classy Wooden Nickel."}
{"text":"I have now been to both locations and can honestly say that when I visit from San Diego, this is my favorite restaurant in the Irwin area. My last visit I had the Duck Duck Goose which was FANTASTIC.  The duck was spot on, perfectly cooked and more importantly not over cooked.  Our service was also excellent. I wish I could remember her name, I know that she mentioned she had worked at the other location and had transferred.  Price range.....it's a little high, but is still in the acceptable range."}
{"text":"This location is amazing! The bar tender and server Devin is the most fun! He is so fast and polite! He makes me laugh every time I'm there!  He also makes great drinks and always has a smile on his face!! The food there is absolutely delicious too!"}
{"text":"So glad we ignored the previous poor reviews in our quest to find a great local restaurant - found!  We sat at the kitchen and received complimentary tastings - a unique surprise. We also enjoyed watching everyone cooking, especially our own meals.  We ordered the pulled pork tacos, French onion soup and Not your mothers meatloaf. I don't think I've ever ordered meatloaf in a restaurant before, but it was all good.  We enjoyed our wine and beer flights (specials on a Friday night).  Yes, we were there for quite a while- which is exactly what we wanted for a nice evening out, enjoying each other's company as well as talking with Laura, our friendly waitress and the sous chef stopping by with some small dishes to sample (or devour). We had so much food we didn't mind at all taking it home in the blue bag."}
{"text":"Terrible service, Terrible food,  a waste of $100.00.  Will never go again.  The waitress apologize but it couldn't make up for the long, long wait for the appetizer.   Finally got a basket of a few pieces of dried bread.  Food, when it finally got to the table was dried out and less than adequate."}
{"text":"As a new restaurant in the area we expected it to be as good as the Monroeville location. It was not but I think it will be just as good over time."}
{"text":"I've never been to the monroeville location that everyone seems to say is good, but the Norwin location isn't too great. I ordered lunch for pick up this week. Blue cheese burger w/ onion rings & chicken pesto sandwich. Chicken was very dry, not much taste, burger was ok, but can get a better one at Applebee's probably. Onion rings were frozen onion rings from the shop n save they are part of next door. For what u pay, not even close to being worth it. Had a coupon which helped, but lunch was $24.00 for 2 to go. It was first and last time eating there for sure. And the to go bag was a shop n save bag to boot. 2 thumbs down."}
{"text":"3.5.  My husband and I went on Valentines day- it was a great date night atmosphere with wonderful and pleasant staff.  I LOVED my lobster mac n' cheese.  Only negative was my husband's Steak frites choice.  It seemed to have premade fries ( or tasted as such quality of mcdonald's fries) with just an okay tasting steak without too much flavor.  Compared to my lobster mac n' cheese and the classy environment, it just didn't seem to fit.  I plan to come back and check it out again though :)"}
{"text":"They opened yesterday.   The food was good, drinks and service were also good.   My only negative comment is the price.  Two people, total of three drinks, no appetizers, no salad, no desert, the bill was $103 + tip.  Most meals were $32-$38"}
{"text":"This visit has been a long time coming. We have heard mixed reviews and always wanted to try it but hesitated because we have very limited time to go out to eat with 1 day off a week. We finally got there for our first time last night. The set up when walking in is very strange because it seems impossible for a staff member to know you're there unless they have a hostess on duty. We walked back to the bar a young man sat us. Tammy promptly came over and greeted our table. She was very welcoming and polite. I had a dirty martini(it was martini night ) and he had an iced tea. We started with the bacon wrapped scallop app. Which comes with a balsamic glaze, it was very clean and simple and I would order it again. After being told about the chefs features we went with the seafood fra diavlo and the filet and stuffed shrimp (which I substituted a crab cake for) I wish I would have remembered to take pictures because they were just as good as they looked ! We were so pleasantly surprised to enjoy everything about our evening from start to finish ! We will definitely be back based on quality and service ! Thankyou for a wonderful experience !"}
{"text":"I was @ a meeting in Irwin earlier this week. There were grilled chicken salad from the wooden nickel. They were terrible the fries were so salty and hardly any chicken to go with the boring greens. I've been there before and left un- impressed.  Now I don't even have to go there to know the food is still of poor quality.  Maybe they should of got salads from the shop n save next door.( Oh they probably did.)"}
{"text":"This is by far the best option this area has for food.  They recently reduced prices on the menu, so it has become way more reasonable.  They have some pretty amazing specials, like Wine Wednesday (5 dollar glasses of wine), Martini Monday (5 dollar Martinis), Saturdays 40% off bottles of wine... etc.    The food is delicious.  The drinks are well priced.  This place is a must go if you're in the area."}
{"text":"This review is more of a 2.5 stars. I'm still tore between two and three. So, I've been to the Wooden Nickel in Monroeville once for a baby shower, and the food and service was decent. This was my first trip to the Irwin location. My mom and I were out shopping and it was late afternoon. I needed to get groceries, but everyone knows it's not a good idea to go grocery shopping on an empty stomach, so we stopped in.  There are three separate rooms- a bar area, the main dining area (with the excellent view of the open kitchen), and another sort of dining room. The latter I assume is used more for larger parties, showers, etc. There was a sign near the front stating to please seat yourself in the dining room, so we found our way there. The place was completely empty. My mom commented on this but I didn't think it was such a big deal since 1) it was late afternoon, way too early for a dinner crowd and 2) the Steeler game was on, and it's not a place you'd go to watch the game. Plus, it was an hour or so before the Pirates game started.  Our first waitress was friendly, she answered some questions we had about the menu, etc. My mom ordered the Pittsburgh salad with shrimp (you could choose between chicken, shrimp, steak or salmon - all at different prices). I ordered the Pesto Chicken Caprese sandwich with coleslaw (other choices were fries, soup or onion rings).   As I mentioned, we were the only customers, and it took a good 25 minutes to get our meals. A second waitress came with our meals and announced she would be our new waitress. She set up mom's salad down and stated that the \"shrimp was buried under the fries\".  My sandwich had fries on the plate and I told the waitress that I had ordered cole slaw; she told me to keep the fries and she'd go get me cole slaw, which she did. My sandwich had two extremely thick pieces of chicken so I decided to eat it without the bun. They were covered in pesto, mozzarella and tomato, which would have been delicious, but the chicken was super dry and there was waaaayyy too much pesto, I had to take a bunch of it off. I did try and few of the fries, you know, since they were there anyways. And I have to admit they were really good, they were crispy and had a nice seasoning. My cole slaw was okay, I like to add pepper but there was none on the table and the waitress wasn't in view, so I went without. My mom's salad was small, even for a lunch portion. There were exactly 3 shrimp, again what the heck, even ridiculous for a lunch portion. But, she did say it was tasty nonetheless.  Our bill came and for some reason the bill was less that it should have been. Salad price with shrimp was $13 but we were only charged $10 and my sandwich should have been $11 but we were charged $9. I thought this was weird, we did order off the lunch menu, but I looked later and the prices are the same for the dinner menu. Obviously, we didn't complain.   Overall, the place is very clean and decorated nicely. I was very surprised at the time it took to get our meals since no one else was in there and the food was fair, at best. I would probably give the Wooden Nickel one more try, but I wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice, but I will not be back.  Overpriced and the food was really bad.  I'm not a picky eater and I am definitely not one to complain, but the food was just plain old bad. I got the crab cake with a remoulade.  Crab cakes didn't have a binding unit and I don't even know what was in the remoulade.  Whatever was in that seemed to be all over the potato hash too.  It tasted like vinegar or soured something."}
{"text":"Loved this place.  The inside decor was beautiful.  The service was great and so was the food.  I ordered the crab macaroni and cheese which was awesome.  We also shared a bottle of wine .  This was a good deal when comparing to the price per glass of wine.  Sometimes they also have someone walking around offering free craft beer samples.  This was a huge plus.  So glad we discovered this hidden gem!"}
{"text":"My Friend and I went here over this week end.  We both had an excellent experience.  We had the Polenta appetizer.  It was really good.  The French Onion soup was the best that I ever had.  My friend had the Crab Cakes and loved them.  I had the feature, NY strip over risotto, it was perfect!  The best part of our experience was our professional, yet fun and friendly waitress, Tammy.  She made our experience exceptional and made us to feel special and valued.  Although they were busy, Tammy even brought the chef out to meet us!  We did enjoy the luxury of having the 40% off coupon, but I will definitely return when I want to celebrate with an excellent fine dining experience!"}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere and delicious food! Plus our waitress Mindy was extremely friendly and efficient!"}
{"text":"Very nice decor, great service & excellent food! Also extensive food & drink menu. I would highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend had wanted to come here for awhile now and so when she got her new job I decided to take her out for a nice meal to celebrate.   The building is beautiful and much larger than we expected. But it was broken down into rooms so it felt much more intimate. I ordered a beer that I had never heard of off of their nice craft selection. I forget hat it was called but it tasted like coffee and it was bad. I ordered the crab and shrimp macaroni and cheese, Alison the chicken Parm. Both dishes on the lower end of the price scale and still our bill was $60 before tip. The macaroni was very good but it didn't have that much seafood in it and shouldn't have cost $26. Alison said that her chicken tasted good but it came out cold.  our server was wonderful, efficient, friendly but good service isn't enough to justify high prices when the food is just okay. If you do decide to go, buy Wooden Nickel gift cards at Giant Eagle for the fuel perks with their prices the fuel perks add up quickly. I was hoping for more, the bar looked worth coming back to, but I won't be paying for dinner here again."}
