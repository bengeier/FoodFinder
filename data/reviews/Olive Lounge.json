{"text":"Olive is sort of the \"do it all\" space in the Madison Hilton.    During breakfast hours, 6:30 - 11am weekdays- you can fix yourself a plate from the breakfast buffet and sit in any one of the comfy chair and table clusters located around the room.  And on weekends, lunch is also available from 12 -2.  But my favorite time to go is cocktail time, for the bartender here makes a mean dirty martini.  And I am happy to sit, relax and watch the people flow in from the nearby convention center.  Windows look out onto the lake and to the adjoining Monona Terrace convention center with it's Frank Lloyd Wright design.  Service is spotty.  Sometimes it's good and other times- while there is a flurry of activity- it appears that all the servers are running room service orders up the nearby elevators.  Definitely not a destination bar.  But the next time you are staying in the hotel- stop in for a drink and linger for a minute to watch the world go by.  And enjoy a martini of your choice with it's namesake olives plunked down into your glass."}
{"text":"We had brunch here with family who were staying at the Hilton. They had coupons to order off the menu,  but we paid, as there was no buffet on Labor Day.   I know I should cut them a break, because it was a holiday and we were a big group. But an hour between ordering and the food coming is just insane. It wasn't just us. I saw another table saying they couldn't wait any longer... And it wasn't just that the food took insanely long, but there were no updates, no apologies, no explanations.   When the food came, it was nicely presented and fine. Probably slightly overpriced."}
{"text":"This is the bar/lounge in the Hilton Monona Terrace Hotel.   Good drink specials, inexpensive and STRONG cocktails, and free appetizers during happy hour. Very comfortable and relaxing atmosphere.  But HORRIBLE SERVICE. We had the same slowww, forgetful, inattentive, annoying bartender for three nights in a row. Go for the drinks - not the people!"}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast several times as we were staying at the Hilton. Pretty great view, nice set up, decent service, and food was just about average for breakfast. I think it would be better for a nightcap or something.. but hey, German places are better for that!"}
{"text":"Beautiful view of the waters, beautiful furniture, amazing service. I had a glass of riesling which was about $12 and the tuna tartare. It was slightly spicy and on top of chopped avocados. You are given deep fried wonton crackers to dip into the tuna and avocado. I would have preferre saltine crackers or water crackers though. I also had the cheese and meat platter- cubes of extra sharp cheddar, slices of salami, block of pâté. It was amazing."}
{"text":"I've had better service at hotel lounge and restaurants. This is the bar/lounge in the Hilton Monona Terrace hotel.   I heard the bartenders make excellent martinis. I was only here for breakfast and there was a fixed hot/continental buffet for $17/15 or so. I thought it was overpriced so we ordered a la carte. Service was LOUSY. My mediterranean omelette was $15 and didn't even come with potatoes or toast. It was just an omelette on a plate. So overpriced in my opinion. The servers were rushing and disorganized, even though there weren't that many people.  We found much better restaurants in the area the next day."}
{"text":"Our family held a Christmas gathering in the Alcove room that is part of the Olives' lounge - actually we spilled out into a portion of the lounge since our group was so big.  Since it was Christmas day that wasn't an issue because it was pretty dead at the hotel and in the lounge.  The bartender, Erica, did a great job hosting us and she kept the drinks coming (nice and strong). Same with the next night when we stopped back after dinner elsewhere.  If this review was just based on Erica I would give it five stars but the food was pretty mediocre.  I know it was Christmas and it was a hotel bar menu but they really should make a better effort with the quality and preparation of the items they do serve - they were just OK for the price.  Anyway we did not let the food ruin the festivities.  Olives worked well as a place for us to celebrate together."}
