{"text":"Small mom & pop burger shop that recently opened and it's definitely  somewhere you wanna check out!

Pretty good burger for the price! Everything is fresh and homemade, and the service is great. 

Had the fearless beach burger with fries and the mother clucker with fries. 

The burger was yummy with good charcoal taste. 

Chicken burger had a nice crispy coating and tender/moist meat. 

Fries were a little on the thick-cut side for those who enjoy those type, but would prefer a little crispier. 

Everything was simple and delicious. 

Overall would highly recommend and would definitely be back."}
{"text":"My reason for coming here today was all the good things that I had heard from people about their burgers.  I am a bit of a hamburger junkie.
But once I saw the menu and spoke with the owner who was serving, I ordered a
Smoked meat sandwich.
Now I always find ordering a smoked meat outside of Montreal a risky thing.  First off, most places can't seem to tell the difference between smoked meat, corned beef and pastrami.  But the smoked meat here is from Lester's in Montreal and served on rye bread with yellow mustard.  Just like in Montreal.
Secondly, most places seem to use a machine sliver for their meat.  Some even brag about how thinly it is sliced.
Here, just like in Montreal, the smoked meat is hand sliced in nice thick slices.  A nice medium fat.  Lean smoked meat just isn't done anywhere that knows there stuff.
Now the next thing that got me were the French fries!  Cut in house and fried twice the way they are supposed to be done.
Now was I surprised that the owner grew up on the block behind the Snowden Deli.  Not really.

The place is small but very clean.  I also heard that they will soon have soft ice cream!

This place is great!"}
{"text":"I read a couple of reviews on the smoked meat sandwich and figured I'd give it a try. I've had authentic \"smoke meat\" sandwiches for many years in Montreal and can vouch the meat at Fearless Meat tasted like the real deal, but whoever cut my sandwich needs a lesson in carving. It was cut too thick, was not hot and steamy, and did not fall apart quite like the meat I love. Not to mention the rye bread wasn't quite right and the mustard was grainy, which I do enjoy on other things but not on this sandwich. The Montreal style sandwich is all about the textures, and although this was close, it missed the mark for me.

Hubby had the beach burger and it was decent but nothing special. We enjoyed the thick cut fries and although the soft serve only comes in chocolate and vanilla, it's so rich and creamy! We would go back just for the ice cream."}
{"text":"I've been there once so far and I love it. I had a poutine ($5.00) which was delicious. I want to say it's just as good as Smokes'. Perfectly melted cheese and plenty of gravy. I also ordered the Beech Burger ($4.00), glad I did! I wish it was around when I was going to high school in the area lol."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place. Me and boyfriend had the Montreal smoked meat sandwich and a cheeseburger. It was absolutely delicious. This place not only has good food but friendly service and a clean atmosphere. It's great to have a local burger place with quality food."}
{"text":"Stopped by Fearless Meats today...ordered the burger only with all toppings...no cheese or bacon...did takeout instead of sitting in. 

The negatives - pretty tasteless bun, meat was a little overcooked. 

The positives - patty was 6oz and larger than than a 4oz standard burger patty, cooked fresh on a flat grill, toppings were fresh, price at $4 was amazing. 

Giving this joint 4 stars. Will definitely be back to try some of the other items on the menu."}
