{"text":"The food was amazing I will go again when I come back. I'm from Las Vegas so when I have good Latin food you have to post it"}
{"text":"My friend and I landed about 4:00PM dreaming to get that arepa hot melting butter over the fresh creamy arepa right out of the owen, I entered and it was as I was in a. Piece of Venezuela land, when I saw my Reynaldo Pepiada! Wenorderen and sat l, the Manager was ofcourse the typical Venezuelan open and welcoming lady.  She made special provision for us because she was about to close earlier due to some repairs needed in the kitchen, still it was a choice worth waiting cuz she made fresh and delicious arepita that  when  done  I got sliding bite by bite in peace down my throat, my dream was finally a reality! Accompanied with a succulent fresh guanabana  juice, the real thing! Was heavenly and paradisiac.  I praise God! Found Arepas on Charlotte!  A must for those who want to adventure something new, you won't be disappointed!  The place was humble but clean."}
{"text":"I had the period arepa and my friend had the mechada arepa.  We also had two empanadas. The food here is excellent. The staff here was friendly. I will tell all my friends to eat here."}
{"text":"After a recent trip to a Venezuelan restaurant in NYC I've found a new love, The Arepa!  After searching for an arepa place in Charlotte it became apparent that Arepa's Grille had to be tried.  Delicious!  My wife and I split the reina pepeada and the domino(substituted Gouda for mozzarella).  Both were so tasty and fresh.  The chimichurri sauce(green) could've had a bit more garlic in it but was still pretty killer.  I drowned my arepa in it.  If you've never tried an arepa do yourself a favor and visit this place."}
{"text":"Few things are better than an arepa - let alone an arepa bar.  As mentioned in other reviews, arepas are made from 100% corn, but they are nothing like a tortilla. In Colombia, they are served plain or with toppings and in Venezuela they are stuffed - but the arepa is generally the same.   Arepas Grill offers the Venezuelan style. The cafe is simple, no frills - just great, fresh food served by nice people. I highly recommend trying the juices with water too. Note, don't go in a rush, expect food to take 15 minutes to prepare."}
{"text":"Arepas Grill is an unique restaurant that serves genuinely Venezuelan and Colombian food. I am originally from Venezuela, and this place reminded how much I miss the food of my country. I had the Reina Pepiada Arepa (Avocado,Chicken and mayonnaise) and it was excellent. I believe they have fair prices since with only one arepa ($7.50) I was completely full. The staff was wonderful explaining us the food and the service was quick (between 5-10 min to receive the food). I strongly recommend this place to any American who wants to try some unique food or any Venezuelan/Colombian that misses their food! 5/5!"}
{"text":"I passed this place on my way home one evening. I finally decided to try it today. Based off of previous reviews, I ordered the Reina Pepiada. I also ordered a pollo empanada with a side of their green sauce. (I believe it's called guasacaca sauce...thanks Google!) Overall, everything was delicious! The empanada filling could use a bit more seasoning but the guasacaca sauce certainly helps. In fact, I wish I'd gotten two of them because it was really good. It's now my second favorite sauce after the guajillo sauce at another local place. As for the arepa, it was excellent. You can't go wrong with avocado and cilantro. The portions are generous and very filling. Their prices are affordable. Others have mentioned the wait can be long, but I didn't mind it at all. Latin cultures are much more relaxed so I anticipated it. I highly recommend and will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"I seriously thought that this was a Mexican place and expected to get a quick taco or burrito for lunch since it is a stone's thorw from work.  Surprise, it's Venezuelan.  Arepas are corn tortillas stuffed with various meats, cheeses, etc. and grilled.    My Arepas was a great value, generously stuffed with beef and cheese and nicely seasoned. A great value for $6.25.   After getting some assistance from the staff I chose the seasoned beef and gouda, a top seller. The menu offers several arepa choices as well as fresh squeezed juices with water or milk.  My passion fruit and water juice was delicious and took me back to my Cabo vacation several years ago!    The staff was friendly, but the service was a bit slow, especially since there was only two other customers there.  Located in a former Quiznos, the restaurant is simple clean, and simple with side lot parking and easy access off Old Pineville Road."}
{"text":"Such nice folks here.  They were so friendly and helpful as I was making my menu decision.  Tasty arepa (I have a killer place by my house that is maybe a bit better), but the service was really lovely."}
{"text":"One of the best and most unique Latin American meals we've had while still in the U.S! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Holy cow.... this place is amazing! If you want authentic Colombia/Venezuelan food this is your place. The food and service is absolutely pronominal. If I could give it 6 stars I would"}
{"text":"When I came in there was no one in line. I ordered the arepa mechada and it took them about 30 minutes just to make the corn cake. I was in a hurry and I told them that the wait was a lot longer than I expected and instead of honoring it the only thing the lady responded back was that each corn cake takes about 10 minutes to make and it is made on the spot. I am now extremely late to work because it didn't just take 10 minutes it took 30 and extremely unhappy about the service they gave me."}
{"text":"Great food and really friendly staff! It didn't take much time to get our food (~5 min). Prices have gone up a little bit in comparison to the pictures uploaded by another reviewer but there are also more things on the menu! The venue is well kept and there's outdoor seating as well.  I had the Reina Pepiada ($7.50) and an empanada de carne ($1.50) and both were delicious! I would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"This wrapped up sandwich is full of so much flavor.  I love it!!  The service was great and it was very clean.  I went during lunch but the line went really quick."}
{"text":"It's a new place but the arepas are tasty and authentic. Try the queso guayanes,la reina pepiada y la guasacaca. This is really a fantastic option for very authentic venezuelan flavors. I reccomend with eyes closed."}
{"text":"Very very good place. Besides Venezuelan food they have some Colombian goodies also. We got 3 arepas. One chicken arepa ( shredded chicken) with cheese. One arepa with perico (scrambled eggs) and cheese. And other one with queso de mano (soft white amazing cheese). The arepas are very big. We got natural juices .. pineapple and passion fruit .. DELICIOUS! I wanna come back to try another type. Everything is hand made from scratch. And try the sauces! Garlic, medium spice and very spice. Soooo gooood! 5 starts. Keep the good work guys!"}
{"text":"Easily one of the best meals I've had in months. I don't know why arepas aren't more common, I guess we just need more Venezuelan immigrants. For those who don't know, arepas are flatbread made with ground corn. It's good stuff and highly recommend them.  I asked the waitress which arepa she likes best and she recommended La Pais, which comes with shredded beef, beans, chorizo and avocado. I also ordered fried plantains on the side, because they are awesome. The arepa I ordered was outstanding. They had two spicy sauces which I enjoyed as well.  Please try this place, it will be a good change and you won't leave disappointed."}
{"text":"Delicious arepas! And the girl that was behind the serving bar was beyond nice, she was super helpful considering that we had never had arepas before, she explained all the options and give us recommendations. We are SO coming back here"}
{"text":"Arepas taste so wonderful you need to buy one now & one for later! The mozzarella arepa was incredible! I once had them in NYC from a street festival and these are the same delicious treat!! I also got the Reina arepa which had chicken, avocado and mayo like chicken salad, which was a savory mix. There are more varieties but I need to go again. For those who are new to this, arepas are corn based cakes with savory meat inside. The meat options and cheese are my favorites. I like the combination of corn cake and meat and cheese. They also have empanadas and other bakery treats I want to try next time.  The prices are reasonable about $5-8 per arepa. The green sauce is spicy but a perfect addition to the savory. The service was quick, nice people for me as I did lunchtime take-out."}
{"text":"Simply delicious !!!! All the food and deserts are freshly made daily by the staff who is so nice, it makes you wanna come back and have lunch and dinner here everyday."}
{"text":"Good but not $16 dollars good for 2 arepas.  Food is tasty but slowly prepared, too expensive for what it is, and lack of amenities like a self serve refill station or plates that don't get soggy.  Friendly people but they could step up their game."}
{"text":"I visited Arepas with my wofe and family. The owner is very pleasant, and the establishment is very clean. Now in regards to the food, ot was all delicious, my wife had the Bandeja Paisa, and I ordered the Cachapa. I had a better Cachapa elsewhere, so that is the only reason I won't give it a 5...oh, the passion fruit juice was DELICIOUS! I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"This is truly a hidden treasure.  These arepas are warm, fresh pockets of goodness! The place is a little hard to find. The workers are really nice.  They even gave me a dessert from the bakery next door to try.  Have been back multiple times. A definate must-try."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time yesterday and it was also my first time having true Venezuelan food. Ordered two of their arepas (Pelua - Shredded Beef and Gouda and Reina Papiaida - Chicken Salad) and the Cachapa which is a sweet corn pancake folded over with cheese in be middle. They are pretty filling and it's almost like eating a nice fluffy tortilla with filling inside. It's pretty close to authentic as my girlfriend who's Venezuelan told me so we'll definitely be back. Esp since I saw they make tamales too!"}
{"text":"I will say they are pricey, but because they are pretty much the only place that makes them ,they can jack up the price. They are very filling and delicious. The creamy avovocado chicken one is my favorite. and all their juices are good too! They take a while to make but I have yet to be disappointed."}
{"text":"Mediocre to say the least, food was reheated in microwave tasted old was overpriced and the ONE lady couldn't or shouldn't answer phones and take orders in person... incredibly disappointed they shouldn't say this is Colombian food!"}
{"text":"I got turned onto this place from the Cooking Channel Show \"Eden Eats.\" Eden herself is a touch spastic and really needs to lay off the Red Bull, but the show is interesting and covers mostly ethnic places off the beaten path. One show took place in Charlotte and featured arepas from the Antojitos mi Colombia bakery.   Arepas are made from pre cooked corn flour, hand molded into disks, pan fried and then baked. They can be split open and filled with all manners of deliciousness and served sandwich style; a corn biscuit of sorts. Anything made out of 100% corn will catch my attention - can't consume gluten; it' been so long since I've had a sandwich out at a restaurant!   The bakery has the Arepas Grill attached. The menu board shows all the different fillings you can get in your Arepa. I uploaded pics of the menu. You order at the counter, wait 10-15 minutes and they bring it out to you wrapped in paper. I ordered the Pelua - shredded beef and gouda. It was warm, the arepa was light and crispy and the meat was well seasoned; I inhaled it in minutes. Absolutely delicious.   Other than the arepa's they serve sweet corn pancakes and also a breakfast platter and desserts. The sandwich was more than enough to fill me up, but heartier appetites may want to order dessert; they had the usual South American options of flan, tres leches and a passion fruit mousse.   An option for a vegetable side dish would be nice, but just a minor quibble. I loved what I ordered and will definitely be coming back to try the different sandwichs and also for breakfast."}
{"text":"In search of something different...Arepas was new to me! I ordered the Reina Pepiada. It was really good. It reminded me of a chicken salad sandwich, but the bread is corn and it was spicier. When you are here, go with an arepa, that's what makes this place so special. Hubs ordered the daily special (fajita) and was wishing he would have gone with the arepa . The fajita was fine, but you can get that at any Latino restaurant. If you like heat, ask for the green sauce...and if you are even more brave, ask for the spiciest sauce! HOTTTTT!  I'm not sure what to compare it to, price wise. But it was good and filling. You can leave under $10 or splurge and get a jugo natural.  It was a bright and cheerful establishment and very clean. The employee that took my order was friendly.  Like others have said, it will take time to get your order. That's good because it means it's fresh. However, if you are on a tight schedule, you'll be risking it and shoveling the food down you (like I did).  Buen provecho!"}
{"text":"Had lunch today & it was great. Will drop by again. Chicken with avocado was delicious."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delish!  Now i'm at home trying to make them myself b/c I live so far away! HA!  The place is clean, the food is great and the service & price is wonderful.    Don't forget to ask for \"the green sauce\" !!   It's right off the Woodlawn light rail :)"}
{"text":"Truly, this would be 3.5 stars, but I digress. I ordered the Reina Pepeada for$6.50 after being offered a taste. Delicioso! It is an arepa stuffed full of a chicken, avocado,mayo & cilantro blend. Creamy and cool, perfect for a warm summer day,   You order, pay, and then have a seat while they prepare your arepa. 5 minutes later, your lunch is brought out, warm and toasty.  I really enjoyed my lunch, and so did my Wife and daughter (they had their own, I don't share). A couple of negatives: a little pricey. And not flexible for people who might not want a specific ingredient. For instance, anything with avocado has it mixed in, so you don't have the option to order without it. I don't eat beans, so I couldn't order my first choice because the beans were mixed in with the meat. Not a deal breaker for me, but picky eaters might have a problem. My next visit might bring this to a stronger 4 stars, we will see."}
{"text":"Since moving to Charlotte, I have been on a hunt to find places to satisfy the random cravings of my Denver staples. One of those cravings are arepas from the Quiero Arepas food truck. If you ever find yourself in Denver, make sure you track them down! So, I found Arepas Grill (thanks, Yelp!) and I headed down to check them out. Just a note... The street address on Yelp is wrong. It is located at 4740 Old Pineville Rd #A. Right next to it's sister restaurant, Colombian Bakery. I walked in and the place was empty. No seriously, there weren't any employees... I waited for a solid three minutes until someone showed up to help me out. Which was fine, as it gave me time to look over the menu. I decided on the Carne Mechada arepa ($6.00) and maracuya (passion fruit) drink ($3.00). He took my order and disappeared to the back. He reappeared a bit later with a freshly made arepa. He proceeded to cut it open and stuff it with the shredded beef and cheese. I asked for the spicy, avocado sauce that I am accustomed to having my arepa served with. The passion fruit drink was awesome! Very fresh tasting and refreshing. I'm on the fence about the arepa. I like how fresh the arepa itself was, but I wasn't really impressed with the fillings. It was definitely tasty, but I am used to my arepas being fixed up with more than just meat and cheese. A little more garnish would have put them over the top! This place could definitely earn the fourth, and even fifth, star easily with a little bit of improvement. They should take a look at Quiero Arepas menu! I would be psyched if they added something like the La Havana to their menu! I'll visit Arepas Grill next time an arepa craving strikes!"}
{"text":"Unbelievably excellent! Highly recommend this restaurant.  We came in with a large group and tried 4 different menu items and shared bites of each.  Super fresh and tasty.  Made to order.  The food was hot and fresh. It's worth the 8 minutes we waited.  The kids loved it.  Friendly and helpful staff.  We are coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Prices have gone up from what the picture says (Carne Mechada is $8.50 now, empanadas are 1.45) place is nice, food is great. They take a while to serve your food (guessing they cook everything as you order and its not frozen). Either way food is great and its a lot. But be aware of the price increase."}
{"text":"This was a fantastic find.  Very authentic food and weekend specials.  Great arepas!!  You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"First time eating Venezuelan food and the arepas didn't disappoint.  Ordered the La Paisa, it was filled with so much pretty much overflowing with avocado, beans, chorizo and shredded beef stuffed in a corn fluffy tortilla-like bread.   Everything was served hot and freshly made.  The beef enchiladas were already prepared, rebaked and served hot.  The pastry was crispy and the filling was delicious.  The restaurant is far from fancy but the food was great and staff friendly."}
{"text":"Amazing food. I got the Bandeja Paisa and it was outstanding. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to return, but I always recommend Arepas Grill to people staying nearby."}
{"text":"I waited for like 30 minutes for my food when there was only 2 other people in here and then I got stung by a wasp on my way out because there was a GIANT WASP NEST right underneath the door! Those don't show up overnight. It's clear the owners ignored that giant wasp next above the door cause it was probably too expensive to call pest control."}
{"text":"I came in based on other reviews... let me tell you it did not disappoint! The arepas are large and in charge... if you are hungry, two will fill you up nicely and you'll get to try a couple of flavors. The chicken salad with avocado is like Old Faithful: an oldie but a goodie.   The place is clean and service is ok.   Again, go for the arepas, come out feeling happy and satisfied!"}
{"text":"This was a great restaurant. Everything was home made and so fresh. The areba sandwiches were amazing. Their green velvet sauce tasted good on everything. I wanted to buy a gallon of it and I would if we weren't just traveling through Charlotte. I would highly recommend it to anyone living there or traveling through."}
{"text":"I was first introduced to Arepas in Las Vegas by one of my coworkers there. Moving to Charlotte, I've been craving them for a while. Yelp to the rescue.  Read the reviews here, location was relatively close to my office so I decided to give it a try. Not disappointing at all.  The wait might be longer than I would wish, but it's irrelevant, as I continue to go back for the food. Perhaps if you are in a rush, don't think it's a quick grab-n-go or order ahead of time and pick-it up on your way.  I've had the Reina Pepeada last time and it was delicious. The shredded chicken was fresh and the avocado sauce is amazing. I always ask for the additional spicy green sauce and basically drench the arepa. It's soooooooooo good.  if you want beef, the carne mechada is nothing to miss! If you are in for something sweet, get the fried plantanos. Nicely crispy outside, but soft and sweet.   The intersection can be a little crazy, so keep an eye out both ways."}
{"text":"Yay, arepas! I hit up this place on a chilly Saturday afternoon while I was out and about and hungry.  When I walked in the first thing I noticed was that the it smelled really delicious inside the restaurant. The place is in an odd little strip mall next to the train tracks and it has zero atmosphere, but the minute I smelled what was going on in there I did not care one bit. I started my arepa explorations with a Pelua, which is beef and gouda cheese. I'm going to go ahead and say that that was the most delicious thing that I've put in my mouth in Charlotte so far this year. A vegetarian arepa (the La Del Gato) with cheese, plantains and avocado was also pretty tasty, although it could have used more plantains and less avocado for balance and flavor. The fresh cheese is out of this world, though. I will definitely be going back. It sounds like this place is doing well, too -- the guy working the counter said he was still cleaning up after a massive lunch rush when I got there just before 2."}
{"text":"Arepa was tasty, but I was the only waiting and it was between 10-15 minutes for my food. 1 Arepa plus drink was 11 or 12 bucks. I've had arepas in Raleigh and from food trucks that were just as good at half the price."}
{"text":"Being a minority, I try and support minority owned and local businesses as often as possible. We stopped in to the arepa grill for what I was hoping would be a quick bite.   Getting a to-go order took a lot longer than I would have liked. From order to pickup took 15 minutes. There was only one customer in front of me, but the  cashier seemed over extended. With the fillings to the arepas already prepared, I assumed it would be in and out.   Now to the food... There was thankfully no portion control. My Carne mechada arepa was loaded to the gills. The taste of the meat was delicious. So much so, I forgot about the wait until now. My wife had an arepa with sweet plantains and cheese. Somehow, some of my carne mechada found its way onto hers  Prices are a little steep I thought. We paid $17 for two arepas. Otherwise, the place was really good."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, and love, love, love this place.  The arepas taste like mom's arepas.  They are professional and overall nice people to order from.  I have only had stuffed arepas and juice when I go there, but I'm sure that I'll be trying more things."}
{"text":"Some of the food is ok. The service and customer treatment really need to improve. I don't recommend the hallacas at all from Arepas Grill.  The natural juices are really good.  The hours of operation are not followed diligently. They are changed sometimes without notice and it's really disappointing to drive all the way from somewhere and find the place is closed during their normal business hours! While I realize sometimes businesses use Facebook to notify clients, not everyone in the world is on their Facebook page and really limits the ability of new clients to understand their actual business hours."}
{"text":"Very good la paisa and decent service it was pretty slow for us being the only ones in here, but the ladies were very nice. Not sure if I'd come back again but it was definitely worth the try."}
{"text":"I had the arepa with chicharron and an empanada. Both were delicious. My only problem with this place is I think the arepas are overpriced. Food is great but prepared extremely slow, it was quite the wait. I loved the food but I truly think it's too expensive for what you are getting, Arepas are supposed to be street food!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! As a Colombian I am very picky when it comes to eating Colombian food and I LOVED this place. I ordered the calentao' and it tasted like something my mom would cook on a Sunday morning. For those looking to try authentic Colombian food, this is your place!  I usually go to Greenville to eat Colombian food because it's closer -although way more expensive- but from now on I'll be coming here!"}
{"text":"Surprising local find that's a perfect alternative to more common cuisines (American, Mexican, Indian, Chinese). Prices are moderate and the food quality is great. I went with the Cazón fish dish and washed it down with a mango juice and flan dessert afterwards. If I had more time and was more hungry I would've gotten the Venezuelan breakfast dish. Overall greet experience and I'm glad my hotel was close to this place."}
{"text":"¡Absolutamente fabuloso! Mi esposa es colombiana y sus estándares de comida \"criolla\" son muy altos.  Ordenamos el calentado con huevos pericos y arepa y fue un éxito total. También ordenamos la arepa con carne mechada y un choripapa que estaba delicioso. Usualmente vamos a Greenville por comida colombiana porque es más cerca pero la comida no es tan rica y es mucho más costosa.  Las personas que nos atendieron fueron super amables y nos hicieron sentir muy bien. Totalmente recomendado para las personas a quienes les gusta la comida auténtica."}
{"text":"Whether you like the bakery goodness (bunuelos, pan de bono, or empanadas filled with CHEESE!) or the arepa side of the house (reina papeada's chicken/avocado/mayo mix is delicious), this place is great.  I use to stop by early on my way to work and get a load of baked goods for my workplace crew, and it was always a hit.    While I've been there upwards of 30 times, I haven't tried many of the full meals, and the pan de queso was a disappointment compared to the NYC versions I've had.  The bunuelos can occasionally sit too long and lose their crispiness, which is one of the saddest things I can imagine.  Still if I am driving by, it's hard not to stop and get some goodies."}
{"text":"We were tired of the same food so decided to try this place out. The food is sssoooo good! We ordered for about 6 of us in the office so ordered chicken and beef empanadas, the chicken arepa, the beef arepa, chicken salad arepa, choripapa and shared it all. Everything was very well seasoned - make sure to ask for the green salsa to go with them that has a little kick to it but not too spicy for those that are sensitive. They also have an orange one but is VERY spicy so be aware.   Only reason it wasn't 5 stars is because they had a little bit of difficulty remembering what we said enough to ring us up. We had to repeat our order a couple times. I had someone who spoke Spanish with me so it helped a lot but they were still a little confused. I think she may have been training, which is why it wasn't too frustrating.   This will definitely be on my return lunch list. They cook everything fresh and pack the arepas so thick you could almost just buy an extra arepa with your order and scoop some out to fill both. Maybe 10 minutes total from ordering to getting your food. There's no way you'll leave hungry, we all need a nap now..."}
{"text":"Excellent food! My boyfriend and I are always searching for great food finds and hidden eateries. This place is a goldmine! I wish I lived here just for this place now! We will be stopping by anytime we are in town now! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Really delicious with a home cooked feel. The shredded beef, black beans, queso fresco, eggs with mixed vegetables and a arepa was a combinations delight. Will decently be our stop to eat when visiting Charlette. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Excellent Venezuelan food. Location is a Venezuelan style Arepera\"; the arepas are big, well stuffed and delicious. We ate the \"Hallacas\" today, it's a Venezuelan type of tamal, and a traditional Christmas dish, it was really good. Passion fruit juice is an a must. Arepa of Queso de Mano, Reina Pepiada, Carne Mechada, are excellent!  Place is clean and has the \"Salto Angel\" waterfall painted on the wall at the back of the restaurant, very nice! Service is friendly and excellent! This is our place to eat when we go to Charlotte!"}
{"text":"The owner is such a sweet lady. I love coming to her store and eating her food. Arepas are amazing and it is my place to go for fresh maracuja (passion fruit) juice. I love the green sauce chicken dish. It is cooked fresh and with much love. It is easy to miss from the street, there is plenty of parking and the place is clean and welcoming. It can get busy around lunch time."}
{"text":"As  a Ven suelan, I gotta day that this place is excellent. Arepas, empanadas and tequeños are on point. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"This place was really delicious.  I had some sort of chicken + avocado salad in my arepa that was very tasty.  My table shared plantains and black beans that were both amazing.  The ambiance isn't amazing, but the food is very very good and very cheap."}
{"text":"Bastante desilusionada con la calidad de la comida venezolana en este lugar. Pedimos una reina pepiada, una cachapa y par de tequeños. El relleno de la reina no tenía nada de sabor, la masa de la cachapa no es la tradicional, parecía más bien masa de torta. Los tequeños no estaban frescos y todo por un precio considerablemente más elevado de lo normal."}
{"text":"I don't speak Spanish but I do speak delicious. The food at Arepas is exotic to my American palette. Everything was so good and it was inexpensive too. You'll definitely get full as they have lots of snackable options on the menu.   I never heard of an arepa until I ate here but they are delicious. You have to try them if you go. They also bring out some nice dipping sauces that spice up the sandwiches and sides on the table.   The lady working behind the counter was super friendly and helpful to our ignorant American tongues. We'll definitely be back.  Donald Trump is a b*tch!"}
{"text":"A quick yelp search lead me here for lunch recently and I ordered the La Paisa arepa and a diet coke to go. The wait was about ten minutes (which felt kinda long given that the place was not busy) but it was tasty and worth it. I like the flavor of the arepa and the fillings HOWEVER what MADE this item so tasty was the fresh avocado and the green salsa. Without it, the meal would've been too heavy and not flavorful enough. The one thing I really didn't like were the pieces of pure beef fat in the arepa. There were about three pieces and I picked them out. This may not be a negative for some but it was for me. Regardless, it was easy enough to take out.  In general - it was good (with some modifications) and filling. I would recommend it!"}
{"text":"So, I've never had Arepas. I've had Mexican Gorditas and Salvadorian Pupusas... Arepas seem to be similar to these. Sadly, I'd take a gordita or a pupusa any day of the week over an arepa. Not that there's anything wrong with arepas, they just didn't have the same addictive side-effect their Mexican and Salvadorian counterparts did.  Now, to the actual experience here; mine was fine. Just fine. Nothing bad, nothing good. It was just fine. I did screw up a bit as I only noticed the big boards right above the food prep area thinking it was a very limited selection. Only after ordering did I realize that they had a much larger selection of arepa option on the back wall.  I ended up ordering Reina Pepeada arepa and another one that was just a corn disc with cheese (I can't remember the name. I didn't have to wait very long for either of them, so that was good.   The Reina Pepeada was literally overflowing with the filling, which tasted like a very bland chicken/mayo salad. I didn't get much of the avocado, much less cilantro. It was a massive portion and I didn't finish it. The other one was pretty bad. But I think that's the way it's supposed to be. The corn disc itself was so dry it was hard to eat without liquid. It simply tasted like a very thick dry tortilla with a little bit of white cheese on top.  Overall, it was ok. I didn't' dislike anything, but I didn't really like anything enough to be all like, \"duuuuuude, let's totally go get some arepas!!!\".  My biggest gripe is how extremely overpriced everything seemed. Again, Gorditas and Pupusas seem to have more character, flavor, and deliciousness and they're about 1/4 of the cost of the arepas here. They seem to use the same ingredients, so I do not know why the price discrepancy. The price points for all the products and how bland my food was, are the sole reasons why I will probably not return."}
{"text":"The arepas are way over priced. The service is not that great. We waited 15 minutes before receiving any help by the lady in the front. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Extremely good food, great variety, very friendly staff! The Arepas are delicious, you can get them filled with all sorts of stuff, everything is very flavorful. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Ok.  Just ok.  A big pile of pretty much flavorless meat.  I was definitely expecting more out of it.  There are just too many other choices in that part of town for me to go back."}
{"text":"This little back alley gem was just right for a quick in and out lunch. I ordered two beef and two chicken empanadas. I had never had them before so I figured what the heck, may as well try em. They had a lot of items on their menus that I would like to try in the future so I will probably be back as this is pretty close to my work.  The empanadas were absolutely delicious,  I cannot believe I missed out for so long. They were freshly made and fried and had a corn meal type crust. 4 hit the spot just right, and the sauce that came with them was amazing as well. I would love to know how they make it. My buddy got some sort of Venezuelan sandwhich that I didn't catch the name but I plan on trying next time and it looked even more tasty than my empanadas."}
{"text":"It was my first time trying Venezuelan and it definitely won't be the last! We ordered a beef empanada and La Paisa arepa, which was the most expensive item on the menu at almost $10.  The best part about the empanada was the hot sauce...It was so delicious that we had to ask for more of it. Otherwise it wasn't that remarkable. It contained chunks of meat which weren't really evenly distributed throughout. This led to some meatless bites.  The arepa was out of this world good. Ours had shredded beef, chorizo, beans, and plenty of avocado. The avocado tasted so fresh and was a great complement to the hot meat and beans. It was a little messy to eat but nothing a few napkins couldn't fix."}
