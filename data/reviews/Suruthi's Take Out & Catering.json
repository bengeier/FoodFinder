{"text":"Grab 3 delicious samosas or a tasty meat roll for only a dollar, or dip into their lunch specials of delicious curries and rice for about $7. This place is fantastic and the food is always excellent, especially for a dollar-conscious take away!"}
{"text":"This is takeaway place only. I picked up Idli and Medu Vada, which were decently priced. When I asked for extra sambar, it was for $5 which was on higher side. Also it is cash only.  The Idli and Medu Vada tasted perfect. The sambhar was strictly okay."}
{"text":"This is the best place for Sri lankan food in Cabbadge town. Omg their somosas are to die for and the food ooohhh wow is an explosion of flavors in your mouth, beautifuly cooked always fresh because the guys cook daily, you better go early because it finishes fast. I have been going there since I move to this neighbourhood. The owner and his wife are really nice warm people and the cook delicious. Plus you get a lot of food at a very low price.  I will keep coming to this place for the rest of my life!"}
{"text":"Still serving out food that's worth trying, if you are in the neighborhood. Just got this dinner combo, Mutton Curry, radish, spinach & dahl (lentils) on rice all for $8.00"}
