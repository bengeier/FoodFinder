{"text":"Well this is the third time in three weeks we were there. The wait was quoted as 11/2 hours for a table. The lobby was not very busy and there were quite a few open tables. They probably did not have enough help to adequately serve the open tables. We chose to sit at the bar, because it is first come first serve. We found a seat within minutes at the busy bar. We decided to try the chicken tacos and the pulled pork tacos. These items as has been with most food ordered was very good. The only disparaging remark about the food was the noticeable difference in portions between the chicken and pulled pork. The pulled pork tacos were stuffed with meat. The chicken tacos were sparsely filled, It would be safe to say if the taco flours were clear you could have read the menu thru the taco. I am not sure why, however it was disappointing; common sense says you do not send two comparable items to the same table with such a glaring difference in portion sizes. With that being said the wait for the food to come from the kitchen was the fastest we have seen, comparable to other restaurants. If you choose to sit at the bar you may want to be prepared for the exchange of beverages from the bartender and a hairy armed patron to pass over you meal. The last two visits I have noticed that the manager has been busy delivering food to guests. I wonder if this is the best use of his time. In a new restaurant I would think his presence in the dining area observing and speaking with guests could be more beneficial. This visit was an improvement in service and a decline in  perceived food quality."}
{"text":"Our 2nd visit - we like the tables in the bar, great service, good food, if you can stop by for \"happy hour\" do!  Favorite sides are the dirty-grits and the succotash - try the burnt tips, you will like em.  Oh! Make reservations unless you like waiting to get seated."}
{"text":"First time there Monday. I grew up going to Marcelitas and was sad to see it go.  This place is awesome and I'm glad something is at this location that will work. Pretty spectacular decor, good beer selection, lots of Bourbon. We both had burnt ends and they were great. Tribe and Browns were both on and the TV setup is really good. Great job and we will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Good food, but a one hour wait for food after ordering. Waitress said that was a normal wait. This place just opened last week, and it seems like they're still working out the kinks. The kitchen flooded while we were there."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and friends said they had just tried this place. Get in early if sitting at the spacious bar or call for reservations. Food was good, burger got a bit overcooked however their still new. Appetizers were also very good as were the drinks at the bar and the TV's are big. Casual dress and nice atmosphere makes for a decent night out."}
{"text":"The food is not the best BBQ I've ever had, but there is a variety of options for everyone.  However, let's talk about the service.  I've been there four times now and I expect WAY better customer service for the amount of money I spend there for dinner and drinks. Obviously when a new establishment first opens, there is a learning curve, but this place has been open long enough to improve their service.  The first people you see when you go through the door is the unwelcoming hostess staff.  Usually there's about four of them.  They never greet with an hello, it's just \"how many.\"  The first time I went, an elderly couple in front of me asked for a table not a high top, not too crazy of a request.  The hostess said they only had tables or they had to wait.  The couple did not mind waiting for the next available table.  During this conversation, the orangeish/pinkish haired hostess told another hostess that she needed to \"deal with them first\"--\"them\" being me.  First of all, you aren't \"dealing\" with anyone, you are helping them.  The hostess should have said \"I will help them first, and then I'll help with this couple.\"  I didn't mind waiting, I didn't mind if that elderly couple sat before me, I just wanted to be talked to like a human being.  I cannot believe this hostess still works there.  She is not polite, courteous, or helpful.  I'm not sure what Oak and Embers' customer service values are, but she does not have any."}
{"text":"Was here last night. Wait for a table was fine--only waited about 5min for a group of four. The drink selection is vast. Serving sizes are perfect. The biggest problem I have with this place is the atmosphere--granted I hated the atmosphere at Marcelita's too. One of the rooms had the brightest lights I've ever seen in a bar/ restaurant. The room we sat in was basically a sun room/ porch, which for a table of adults on a Friday night is not great--and there were plenty of other open tables scattered around better parts of the restaurant. The food was just OK--doesn't compare to Mabel's on E. 4th. Brisket was decent--not too flavorful. The sausage links were dry. The onion rings were watery and had zero flavor. The mac and cheese is amazing. The plus side to all of this--I had 1 mixed drink and 2 craft beers plus an entire meal and my bill wasn't even over $50. I don't think I'll go rushing back to this restaurant unless it's to sit at the bar, which seems to be the highlight of the restaurant, and order appetizers. All in all--OK at best. Again, seems like a cool bar to go to have some drinks and grab some snacks."}
{"text":"Food was average.  Portions were very large.   The service was terrible.  We had reservations and we were seated promptly but the waitress didn't come to our table for over 20 minutes.  Then it took another hour to get our meal.  The waitress never offered to refill our drinks, bordered on being down right rude and acted like she was doing us a favor to bring us the check.  There are much better places to spend an evening out."}
{"text":"Highly recommend!!  This is our second visit. Reservations are a must to get a table. We all had the pulled pork dinner and one person had the ribs. Everything was very good. We will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"The restaurant just opened, and it's beautiful.  We arrived a little after 5pm and the place was packed. Word got out that this is the new place to go to! They have a huge selection of wines, beers and bourbon... Something for everyone. The menu is widely varied, and everyone would find something that appeals to them with no problem.  Saying that, there are a few items we had issue with. We ordered crab cakes as an appetizer,  and they were prepared and presented perfectly. We loved the kick of the sauce that the cakes were finished with. My husband ordered chicken and waffles with a side of green beans and I ordered the smoked sausage with green beans and Mac and Cheese for entrees. The sausage was over cooked, a bit hard, and the green beans were under cooked, raw almost. With my meal came corn bread, and that was hard, way over cooked as well.  The chicken was fantastic, and the Mac and Cheese was excellent!  Our server was great, very friendly and attentive. We're chalking this experience up to new restaurant kinks that will work themselves out after everyone gets a bit more experience in working in a popular place.   We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I just wrote a giant review and Yelp deleted it. Sorry Oak but I don't have time to rewrite it."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the awesome pulled pork and the beer selection!  Sides of Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes were very good!  I took half my food home - generous portions and reasonable prices.  New to the area, I didn't realize it was new for the location until I talked to some of the locals.  Bar seats were great to watch the Indians play with a great open air environment - enjoyed the extended summer like temps!  I will look forward to a return visit - best to arrive early as it filled up fast."}
{"text":"We had a reservation and were greeted promptly and taken right to our table on a Sunday night.  We had a group of six and the place seemed a bit understaffed as our waiter was very busy and had difficulty getting to all his tables throughout the restaurant.  The waiter when he got to us was very knowledgable about gluten free options which are essential to my wife.  The kitchen was not as attentive and he took and appetizer back to check when it was delivered and came back with one which had been made in the gluten free fryer.  So the ordering system and special orders seem not to fully get the message to the kitchen which makes the wait staff have to run to make sure the orders come out right since others deliver from the kitchen.   They need to get the bugs out of their systems so they don't serve the wrong things as often...   The food was worth the wait and mostly the fumbles of the kitchen staff.  Bourbon selection is amazing.  One of my table mates had the brisket which was delicious and plentiful. Another had the meat loaf which he described as meat loaves as it was plentiful.  Desserts were worth exploring cheesecake was huge.  If you get the bourbon ice cream ask for the bourbon glaze largely raw sugar but that bourbon taste really hit the spot.  Desserts were all splittable as were many of the entrees and appetizers.   If they got the bugs out of the communications with the kitchen and staffed better I would have given it five stars."}
{"text":"My family and I thought was just ok, pricey for the quality.  Cornbread tasted old or just dry... probably will not go back..."}
{"text":"This is one of the best BBQ restaurants we have dined at! Wonderful food and wonderful service. Definitely needs reservations!"}
{"text":"Marcelita's -- my absolute favorite restaurant growing up closed down and this one took its place so I decided to give it a try. It has a very clean, new sports bar feel. The dining room we were in had tv's on the wall, which allowed us to enjoy tv without having to sit at the actual bar. I felt very welcome as soon as I sat down. Reagan was our server and she was super nice and attentive which made our experience really pleasant.   I ordered the brisket platter with green beans and cheddar smashed potatoes. My mom had the Brisket Melt. I enjoyed the brisket, It was tender and flavorful.  I received a huge portion on toast along with sweet corn bread, which had like a honey butter crust (so good). I liked the cheddar mashed which were smooth and creamy. My green beans were overcooked, tried them, didn't like; so I didn't eat them. I also sampled the Brisket Melt; when it arrived it was so big my mom said she was embarrassed lol. It was huge but it was also very good. Her brisket was shaved which made it even more delicious in combination with the hearty bread--perfect for that kind of sandwich. The pepper spread and bourbon mushroom sauce both had a really good taste.  We also ordered drinks; I had the Sparkling Embers --which Reagan said was the owners wedding drink...I loved that little detail....and my mom ordered Bourbon Root beer Float. Both drinks were made well and were strong. I looooved the Sparkling Embers. My mom was a little disappointed that her float didn't have actual ice cream in it, but she still thought it was pretty good. Overall I really liked dining here. I'm definitely going back. I recommend this to anyone who loves bbq. There are so many different things to try... there's pretty much something for everyone including vegetarians.  Because the menu is so big I suggest looking at it before you go just to get an idea of what you'd like. Fun atmosphere, friendly service and good food"}
{"text":"Food was awesome as usual but service was slow waitress was disorganized and inattentive"}
{"text":"I am not a fan of giving bad reviews, especially to new restaurants. So here is what I will say - make a reservation because there is usually a wait. The owners did a fantastic job of remodeling the place since it was the Mexican joint, and I cannot wait to use the patio in the summer when it gets warmer. The food was good - the menu is big and there are plenty of options to choose from. I would go back for sure to give it another try - the only bad thing is that the service was very poor. I am not sure if my waiter was having an \"off\" night, but I sat there for 15 minutes before he came over to get my drink order. I actually wasn't even sure who my waiter was for the longest time because there was no indication of who it was when I sat down. He also waited on 2 other tables who sat down after me before he took my drink order. And then it took another 10 min to get my iced tea, and another 10 on top of that before I got my alcohol drink from the bar. I am hoping that that when I go back, the service is better because this place has a lot of potential and the food was great. I would hate to see it not do well because of servers who put half effort in."}
{"text":"A little on the expensive side. OUTSTANDING selection of beer and bourbon.  Bar staff was extremely knowledgeable and helpful."}
{"text":"There's good news and bad news so that's why I choose to give a 3. The good news is the food is amazing! The menu is awesome and everything tasted great. My salad (the mixed greens salad) looked so beautiful i didn't want to eat it. HOWEVER, I side the restaurant it is loud and freezing cold. It took forever (about 45-60 minutes) to get our food. I was with two other people and each of our meals had something wrong (steak well instead of medium, wrong salad dressing, wrong vegetable). The service was just ok. If you can get past all those things the food is some of the best in town, honestly."}
{"text":"Food was on point... smoked to perfection. Beer and cocktail selection was fantastic. Only went four stars because they did not have Belvedere vodka."}
{"text":"We tried twice the food is not very good.  The service and decor were nice.  But I couldn't eat my dinner the second time."}
{"text":"I wasn't too eager to make dinner plans for this place. My husband spent the better part of a weekend talking the place up based on what he had \"heard\". I had never been a fan of it's culinary predecessor, and the outside face lift just doesn't scream \"rustic steakhouse\" to me, however, I gave in to appease the hubs. All in all, our dinner this evening was a MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT.  Yes - the extensive interior remodel is a major improvement over what once was. However knocking out a few walls and covering them in faux wood wallpaper does not a great meal make.  As stated in previous reviews, the three teenaged hostesses were still huddled at the front counter when we arrived and looked dazed and confused when WE greeted them. The proposed hour-long wait was entirely anticipated and even though it was full of patrons watching the Indians game, were able to find seats at the bar and order a cocktail or two before our table was ready. Our hour wait ended up being closer to two hours because many people had made reservations. Apparently, to eat in a timely manner, reservations are necessary here.  Once seated, we ordered the Cajun shrimp tacos as an appetizer, the beef brisket sandwich with a side of baked beans, fries and corn bread, and the Cajun grouper with cheddar mashed potatoes.  The shrimp taco appetizer was a few notches below sub-par. The shrimp was in some kind of creamy sauce, sprinkled with the tiniest amount of cheese; I literally watched the excitement drain from my husband's face as he chewed - they were that bad. We didn't finish them. As for our entrees, my husband liked the brisket, but couldn't eat the beans. We think there may have been some kind of chili pepper/sauce in them, and it wasn't tasty. As for the grouper - all I could taste was the Cajun seasoning, and the cheddar mashed potatoes were cold and far from the creamy, cheddary delight I had been hoping for.  Our take-away was this: if you want to have a few drinks and maybe eat some wings, but don't want to drive to BDubs, then this place will do. If you want a few drinks and an incredibly tasty meal - drive to Cleveland."}
{"text":"Went on a Tuesday night with my dad and my fella. Awesome food, really fast service, our server was fun and attentive. I ordered a pork chop dish and loved every bite. Can't wait to come back on a weekend and check out the bar scene. Would definitely recommend this place and plan on visiting again soon."}
{"text":"staff is extremely slow, too young and very inexperienced. food is good but not worth the poor service. i suggest getting it to go, and that is chore in itself."}
{"text":"Great casual atmosphere. Brisket and wings where perfect  good place to watch a game. Nice big bar."}
{"text":"First visit on 8/24/17. A little above average. Got brisket sandwich which was flavorful but fries were stone cold. Salad was loaded with bad onions and wilted lettuce. Tried to get quarters from a rude bartender for the kiddies stuffed animal grab machine. If they keep the machine they need to fix it so it takes dollar bills or put a change machine jn the place. Will give the place another try because of location."}
{"text":"I've been watching this place over the last several months. Decided to try for lunch.   We got the pulled pork and the brisket sandwiches. I did not try the pulled pork but was told it was good. The brisket was really good. Needed a bit more sauce. Seemed like the sauce for the brisket was more vinegar based. The sauce for the pulled pork was sweet and smokey and tomato based. Got fries but they were a bit over cooked. I like crunchy but these were just really crunchy. I will give them benefit of the doubt that it was a fluke. The sweet potato fries looked good though I did not order. I was told they were good.   Service was good. The interior is completely changed from Marcelita's. Looks good. Big bar in the larger room and the old bar area is now just a dining room. 2 garage doors are now on the side. Should be cool patio in the summer.   It is a bit pricey. Most BBQ is. Nice portion though. I did take half my sandwich home. 2 sandwiches and an ice tea were $30. So bring your cc."}
{"text":"Hate to say this buy its just ok.  We were so excited to have another place to eat in Hudson but in the end, guess not.  Dont see myself going back but gave 3 stars bc i live here. Service was average, food was just ok, and drinks are drinks.   Price is on the higher end for what you get but it pays for the owners new porsche 911 and maserati suv in the back :).   My hope is this summer it will be nice to eat outside."}
{"text":"Food is always excellent at this place!  Excellent portion size and a huge selection of drinks especially bourbons!  There was an error tonight on the timing of our order but the manager Joey made up for it in a big way!!  It's nice to see such caring customer service.  We'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant tonight on a recommendation from in laws and some friends. Really glad I did. Very refreshing from the regular bbq joints in the area. We walked right in at 5:30 on Monday night. No Cleveland sports on tonight. Service was respectable. Waiter told us about the dishes we had questions about. Could have stayed on the refills a little more frequently, but I won't deduct points for that. The restaurant was becoming busy quickly. I could see the need for reservations. Now onto the grub. We started with the cheese curds and burnt ends. The ends were very flavorful and with a side could have made a meal on its own. Perfect mix of fat with meat and sauce. But, we're big people, so we didn't stop there. My wife had the short rib which was dynamite. My dad had the half rack which he thoroughly enjoyed. My mom had the chicken and waffles. She was extremely surprised at how good the waffle was. Lastly, I had the half chicken with sweet potato fries and dirty grits. That meal hit on all cylinders. The sides like the grits were unique and offered something not found at other places. Would have loved to drink some bourbon, but had to drive back to Akron. I'm surprised to read some of the other reviews. When a place is new, you have to give it some time to work out the kinks. Not just a couple weeks. If you like bbq, you owe to yourself to try it. Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"Went there this past Friday. We had a reservation for 6. Table was ready when we arrived which is very appreciated. Server came right away and so did our drinks. Got 2 appetizers the burnt ends and nachos. Both were very good but the burnt ends were better but a little pricey for what you got. Dinner was why it's only a 3 star. My table gave it an average rating across the board. Pulled pork, pork chop, ribs, brisket were all just ok. We'd go back but probably just for drinks and apps in the bar. May try dinner again after some time."}
{"text":"This was our first time here, we were treating another couple for a birthday.  We got drinks and ordered our food, menu looked great! Two minutes after our food came the FIRE ALARM  went off!  The alarm was so loud and hurting many people's ears.  The waitress and multiple staff came by and said \"it's just smoke in the kitchen, no need to leave\". Well the alarm was never shut off and me and my sister were getting a headache from the noise and stepped outside till they could turn it off.  Then the fire trucks  came and as I'm standing outside ALL the kitchen staff comes running out of the kitchen and I see other staff leaving the building.  While my husband and brother in law are still inside along with many other customers.  The waitress gave my husband to go boxes and then had the nerve to make him pay FULL PRICE for our food.  ARE YOU SERIOUS??? What a slap in the face when she gave him \"free appetizer coupons\".  We ripped up the coupons and left them on the table. TEACH YOUR STAFF WHAT TO DO WHEN A FIRE ALARM GOES OFF.  You don't let customers sit there and then have the nerve to ask them to pay FULL Price for food they couldn't eat.  I hope they are fined for not making customers leave right away."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed. Out of onion rings, Tito's and cheesecake. Also no bleu cheese stuffed olives. Service was slow and the waitress was snotty. Need better acoustics. Hard to talk to others in our group. Nice remodel though.    Another awful experience! Avoid this place. Rude staff!"}
{"text":"Great staff at this newer restaurant between Hudson and Twinsburg. Decor is comfortable and mildly southern/western without yeehaws and hats. More classy Kentucky Derby south but with a relaxed vibe. Extensive beer list and sweet sauce made me happy. The dirty grits were nice and I liked the chicken nachos."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by a few weeks after they opened and the wait and service was terrible but the food was good.  I didn't write a review at the time because I wanted to give them the chance of working out the newbie glitches and was hoping the food would at least stay the same if not also improve.    Fast forward several months later and I stopped in with my dad for dinner and they had in fact fixed themselves.  The service was good and so was the food.  We started with the burnt ends.  95% of it was delicious the other 5% was solid fat.  My dad thoroughly enjoyed his chicken and waffles with a side of apple slaw while I dinned on the tasty pulled pork tacos.  I couldn't finish all three huge tacos so I got to have a wonderful leftover lunch the next day."}
{"text":"Luved this place. The bar is very beautiful with great selections of beer and wines. The food preparations are \"par excellence\"  The atmosphere is very nice and the service is great . Special thanks to Amanda and Cori who made sure everyone was having a great time . Will most definitely recommend this place . Thx DR MD"}
{"text":"Not Quite Ready for Primetime Many things weren't clicking. First we played seating roulette being moved twice to avoid being seated in the same room with a large raucous party. Although we had asked to be seated in one of the empty booths we were told that wasn't possible.  (They remained empty all evening).  Next I ordered a glass of wine from the menu but our server said they didn't carry it. I had to point it out to her. When my husband asked for a bourbon from their extensive list he was told it wasn't available. This went on three times so he switched to beer.  Of course when I ordered an appetizer our server informed us they were out of it, but by then I expected it. The tavern is new in town and every one in our party found the food enjoyable so I'll give it some time and try it again."}
{"text":"The burnt ends and cornbread are out of this world good. Great drinks and great service, it's a staple for the weekend and an awesome addition to Hudson"}
{"text":"Between the city boundaries of Hudson and Twinsburg we found this BBQ restaurant. The restaurant was easy to find and plenty of parking on the left of the restaurant and around to the back. It has a tavern and rustic feel. A patio area outdoors and booth or table seating inside.   Our server was very personable and sweet. It was a great first impression, however, things went sour thereafter. They had an impeccable list of bourbons but were out of most all of them. Nevermind that, lets get to the food.   We ordered 3 different meals one of which was a smoked maple bourbon salmon that we requested green beans with. The salmon had a bland taste and the green beans were firm and rubbery. The name and picture is deceiving. I was thinking a sweet, savory, robust flavor. Nope, must have smoked off. The other two meals were smoked meats with sides. My husband got the pick 3, brisket, chicken and ribs. I just got the Brisket. First let me tell you that the one and only BBQ sauce they have at this establishment is NOT appetizing. Rather thick and tart. Maybe a jam texture. I prefer a more vinegar, sweet taste that drips with goodness. Also, I have visited many BBQ places that usually have many different style sauces and flavors. Disappointing as this makes or breaks the restaurant and sets some apart from others. Back to the meats. The ribs were seasoned perfect and fall off the bone. Very good flavor. The Brisket was tough and chewy. They dumped a whole lot of sauce on top, maybe to mask the toughness? Ugh. I was looking forward to a soft, buttery texture but NOPE. The chicken was overcooked and again, a lot of sauce poured on top. The corn bread was served with each meal. It was very, very dry. I was hoping for a moist center with a crispy top but not what I got. It was a large serving.  Overall, I can't with this restaurant and I debated on actually writing this review but I needed the restaurant to know truly how I feel in hopes they consider some changes. Maybe my experience was a one off and more people think its great. Come by and find out. After we left I knew I wasn't coming back after we got our check. Not worth the $90+ with tip we paid."}
{"text":"Loved it! Their pulled pork was really great, and brisket was pretty good as well. Next to Mabel's in Cleveland this is the best BBQ around our area it seems.   We reserved on open table. Our waitress was amazing..... super knowledgeable and friendly! She was telling us they had worked in perfecting their fries, and it seems like they did it because that was one of my favorite parts of the meal! My wife loved their corn bread with a sweet crust on the top.   We love Winking lizard and it reminded us a lot of that atmosphere with just a smaller, more fresh and well crafted menu.   Give it a try! We didn't go when they first opened but based on some other reviews it seems like they have worked out the kinks!"}
{"text":"I am personally not a ban of barbecue, but this place is outstanding! I went when this restaurant first opened so the service was pretty slow and the staff wasn't as attentive as they should have been. I blame the slow service and lack of attentivness on the fact that it just opened so I couldn't blame anyone for that. I wouldn't say Oak and Embers is traditional barbecue because I liked it and like I said I am not a barbecue fan. Oak and Embers has a modern rustic feel to it and the atmosphere is inviting. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"They did a great job remodeling this place. Huge! We enjoy coming here a lot. The burnt ends appetizer is awesome. You can't go wrong though with whatever you get :) I don't really care for bourbon but that's in all their mixed drinks so I don't like any of them. That's ok though."}
{"text":"As far as BBQ goes it was fairly average. Cornbread was dry and sweet potato fries weren't awesome. Also, they need to have options for sauces, I didn't really like the bbq sauce that came on everything. No mustard, vinegar or spicy bbq sauce options. The atmosphere is great though!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to see their new location. They open at 4pm and when we arrived there was a line about 15 people deep. The interior is large, they have a nice large bar area, large dining room and also seating in their solarium. They also have a nice outside patio which was not setup for seating just yet. The service was great and for only being open at this location for about two weeks I would have to say they have worked out most of the kinks.   Items ordered   House smoked wings. My preference would be a little more smoke flavor and for them to flash fry them a bit to crisp them up. The were just a little to rubbery for my taste. Next, fried chicken with cheesy succotash, the fried chicken was great and it had a honey hot sauce that comes with it that is to die for! The cheesy succotash was amazing, nice and cheesy. Also had the pick three with brisket, Ribs and pulled pork. The meat was juicy and flavorful. The sides were mac & cheese which was not really cheesy and the noodles were over cooked. The other side was their dirty grits, I can't get enough of those grits they are so good. Also had the beef short rib and it was cooked perfectly. The meat was super moist and flavorful. The side was apple slaw and it was really good. Also had the grilled salmon with tostones and green beans. The salmon was grilled to perfection and the same for the green beans. Over all a great experience hope they keep up the good work and we will return."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to the opening of this place. I wanted it to be great. Sadly, the BBQ here was about as good as the Mexican food in the buildings previous business.  I should have checked that reservations were the preferred seating method. We arrived a were told we had a 30 minute wait while empty tables sat through our wait. When we were seated it took some time to be greeted by our server. She took our drink orders and when I said we were ready to place the rest of the order, we were told we would have to wait until she came back with our drinks. What a wait that was! The slow, un-attentive service continued the rest of our visit. When the food did arrive, it was just, OK. Of the four sides we ordered, only the grits were worth eating and they were good. The fries were soggy and limp, the Mac & cheese was bland and tasteless, and the BBQ Beans were not cooked long enough. The smoked sausage was overly seasoned with fennel, unless your a fan of smoked black liquorish. The burnt ends were good. The pulled pork and ribs were just OK. Nothing to make me take notice. Certainly nothing of note that would bring me back. If your a fan of good BBQ, keep your expectations in check before heading here, and also be sure to make a reservation."}
{"text":"Nice new restaurant in northern Hudson, in the renovated Marcellitas location on 91.  The food is great and abundant. I've been here 4 times and have had 4 different meals. Each one has been great.  I especially like the brisket, the meatloaf and the grouper.  Large portions, reasonably priced.  The beer selection is good and if you are into bourbon, the selection is good. The ambience in the bar is great. The only down side, as stated in other reviews, is some of the staff. They need to fire the hostesses and get more friendly, problem solving people to make their restaurant's first impression. The waiters/ waitresses have been 50/50. Hopefully they will get this worked out with time and constructive criticism from unhappy patrons. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Both the bar staff and our waitress were awesome. However, that's TA out where the good review ends. Ribs (2 star), brisket (1 star), sides (3 star). The dirty grits were good, the onion rings were good, the green beans were eh, the veggie side eh, the burnt end app Good. Disappointing to say the least based on the fact that their Chesterland location is so successful."}
{"text":"I am giving it a 3 for now because I have been twice now once when they first opened and once this month after being open a while.   The first time we went it was so crazy busy. We waited an hour to be seated and another hour to get out food. The ordering system seemed confusing for the servers as they could not locate wines and such on the menu on the tablet. This remained true once we came back the second time as well. Slowed the process and seemed more inconvenient than helpful for them.   We had a large group of 16 the second time but made a reservation for that. It was very well set up when we got there and the room looked great. They were accommodating with changing the TV to a station we liked. I do think they should have had two staff members helping out our table given the size and other staff members popping by but the restaurant fairly empty for lunch hour.   One drink order came out wrong and our bills even though taking time to separate them on the tablet with her were still wrong. Items were spread around other members. Again, I don't like those tablet things they use.  However: THE FOOD! It continues to knock your socks off like the other location.....They have such a focused menu with great dished and they do it right. Love the flavor, the portions, and don't mind the prices given the other two factors. I do wish the dishes came with sauces such as sour cream, BBQ sauce, or ranch on the sides because feels like everyone always has to ask for them anyways here. We will be a frequent flyer here because it is close to home, cute decor, and quality food with leftovers but they still need some work with service and working out the kinks in their system."}
{"text":"Well, not what we were hoping for.  We waited a little more than a week after opening in hopes they would be on their game; we were wrong. We knew we would have a long wait and we did (50 minutes to be seated). No big deal since the place just opened after months of delays. We went to the bar to get a drink while we waited and we encountered the most rude female bartender I've ever experienced. Besides \"what would you like\", I'm not sure she could speak. No please, no thank you, no smile, nothing... we felt like a burden. We are finally seated and we ordered right away since we had time to look at a menu. Another hour passed and we still had not received our food. We inquired with the waitress and one of the owners as they passed, but no one ever came back. We finally told the owner we didn't want it anymore as 2 hour and 15 minutes had passed since we've arrived. We were told \"sorry\" and he scurried away. Granted, we didn't pay for our last drink, but I wonder if the staff gets their bad attitudes from the owner. The place seemed okay, but I'm not sure we will ever go back. Here's my tip for them; customers have a choice and your service will help them to choose somewhere like Brewsters in Twinsburg or one of the fantastic restaurants on the square in Hudson."}
{"text":"Food, drinks and atmosphere was great. Service....eh. Server Dave made me and my party of 6 uncomfortable with his stabs about my vegetarianism. Actual quote after ordering a bean burger: \"First time coming to a BBQ place and you order a bean burger?\" We told him I was a vegetarian and he continued to RIDICULE me and asked condescending questions regarding my diet. \"Do you just eat carrots?\" And my favorite \"Plants are alive too.\" (Note: no one was arguing otherwise. This guy just thought he was really original and funny) Just really unnecessary and uncomfortable exchange that none of us were entertaining but he just kept going... He got 15% tip because we are good people and service work is rough but this guy needs to learn how to talk to customers. There are other great restaurants in the Hudson area where you can get great drinks AND great service."}
{"text":"The parking lot looked packed, but we got seated in less than 10MIN. The BBQ hit the spot! We ended up getting the BBQ deal, which gave me two sides and a choice of meat. Between the two of us, we got the ribs, shredded pork, cheesy grits, fries, apple slaw, and onion rings. The ribs were my favorite, and the fries were just to my liking (a bit soft). I wasn't a fan of the cheesy grits and the onion rings didn't come out fresh. But if they did, I bet they'd be great. lastly we ended the meal with the cookie skillet. Although it was a thin layer of cookie it was perfect to satisfy my sweet tooth. OH.. best part of the meal, was definitely the cornbread! Crispy outside and warm inside!"}
{"text":"Disappointed in the  lack of accommodations for birthday dinner.  Would not suggest for special occasions."}
{"text":"Have a desire for the meat sweats?  Looking for a solid bourbon list?  This is a good spot for you.  Pulled pork, brisket, ribs and burnt ends (app) were all at our table (plus fried catfish). All were done properly, served in copious quantities."}
{"text":"We had prompt hostess service and attentive waitress. Offered a gluten free well marked menu. We also had brisket at the table that was so tender you could have cut it by just looking at it. Healthy portion. Our son dove into before I could get a picture!!!  The BBQ here is awesome. This looks like a fun trendy place. We came for lunch on a Sunday prior to the start of Football. Pulled pork sandwiches were filling. Again healthy portion. We topped it off with homemade cheesecake. The other son dove into it before I could get a pix!!  A definite return."}
{"text":"Portions were large. We had the beef brisket and half chicken and both were very good! We also got Mac and cheese, succotash, apple slaw, and dirty grits. All were delicious. Our server was also cool and helped explain the menu and suggest dishes. Food came out very quickly. They also have tons of tvs and a big bar area if you are wanting to watch a game. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Our group of seven had a very good first visit to Oak and Embers in Hudson. We had a 5:30 reservation on a Saturday and were seated immediately. Our server answered all our questions and gave us some good suggestions. My son and I had the ribs which were meaty, tender and flavorful. Ask for extra sauce , because ours did not come with any. We sampled several side dishes because there were seven of us and they were all pretty good. Sweet potato fries and traditional hand cut fries were freshly made and plentiful. Mac and cheese was fine but not great. The onion rings and green beans were both good. The cheesy succotash was very good and the dirty grits were fabulous ! We all liked the cornbread. Two in our party had bbq bacon burgers and said they were very good. My mother in-law really enjoyed her pork chop. My son had the half smoked chicken and although it tasted great, it was pretty small. Overall I would definitely recommend this restaurant. Nice atmosphere and large beer and drink list too!"}
{"text":"Though they serve BBQ and smoked meats here I'm not sure I would list this restaurant as a BBQ place. There are no sauces on the table nor were any served with the meat nor offered as a side. Portion sizes were extremely generous. Specialty drinks were rather pricey for the size offered."}
{"text":"We were hoping for good barbecue, which is hard to come by in northeast Ohio. We waited a while after their grand opening due to the mediocre reviews wishing it was just start-up issues, but no such luck.  The food was average at best.  We tried quite a few things..... the brisket, the half chicken, ribs. All tasted ok, but nothing special. The sides are not good ---the cornbread is too sweet and very dry, the baked beans are filled with rosemary (really strong tasting). The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because the servers and hostesses were very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Took my family here last night. The place looks great. We went at 5 because we knew with a new restaurant it would be crowded and we were right. Seated right away. We had a good combination of items. Brisket,pulled park, ribs, chicken and waffles and all were good. We also liked the queso but be warned it comes with pork rinds not chips (which were not good). Service was good. My only complaint is that they up charge for things like a side salad instead of listed sides or chips with the queso instead pork rinds. I know that running a restaurant is difficult but when entrees are $15 to $24 up charging $1 for salad seems silly. Won't keep me from going back though."}
{"text":"My group of 6 got seated on a Thursday night a little after 8pm with no wait. The place was not as crowded as I anticipated from reading the reviews and most people had already cleared out for the night.  I read all 84 reviews before coming here. Every. Single. One. I could tell there was a lot contrasting opinions on the food here, so I wanted to make sure I ordered the right things. I knew I had to get the \"Dirty\" grits. I love grits, but rarely order them and would usually favor Mac and cheese. The reviews mentioned that the Mac and cheese consists of little cheese and overcooked noodles, lol not appealing. I went with the dirty grits and could not have been happier. They had a lot going on, and I'm still unsure what exactly made them \"dirty\", but there was definitely cheese, corn, and some kind of meat. You need to get these grits. You will not be sorry. For my meal, I ordered the chicken & waffle. The chicken was crispy, moist, well-seasoned and served on a cornbread waffle that was equally delicious. It was a VERY solid and satisfying chicken & waffle (and only $11!). My plate actually came with a piece of cornbread although I'm not sure it is supposed to. The cornbread was the only thing I tried that I did not like, like other reviews mention, it was cold and dry.   I also tasted the Bourbon BBQ Smoked Wings, the Burnt Ends, and the plantain chips from others at my table. The wings had great flavor and were very, very moist but also very saucy. The Burnt Ends were awesome, but also very saucy. Like to the point where it's almost more about the sauce than the meat. I can see why this could be a problem and potentially leave people disappointed, but they were really good in my opinion. The \"plantain chips\" are really tostones. They were really nicely seasoned and SUPER good. Most tostones I've had are not done well, super dry, crunchy, and either mad under-seasoned or way too salty. These were perfect, crispy on the outside but nice and chewy on the inside. Just how I like them and crazy delicious.   I got a Moscow Mule which I liked a lot. It was not very strong, which is honestly how I prefer it, so it worked for me. As promised, they have a lot of beer and bourbon options. Everyone at my table liked their drinks.   Every staff member we interacted with was super nice and helpful. We experienced very attentive service and our food came out fast. We asked to have our checks split in a kind of confusing manner, and they were happy to do it.   I wish I could speak to the brisket, pork, sausage, or ribs but I can't. The other people at my table got chicken and salmon. Everyone liked their food. After reading the wide range of reviews, I didn't want to set myself up for potential disappointment. I did the research and wanted something that proved pleasing to other yelpers. Obviously it worked for me! I loved my meal and had a great experience here. I'm visiting from out of town and will likely come back on my next trip."}
{"text":"I really like this place, good food, generous drinks and excellent service! Oh, price is middle of the road !"}
{"text":"We arrived for our reservation at 7:30.  We were seated and ordered but the food did not arrive until 9. Seems they need a bigger kitchen or more help. That's too long. But the food was good"}
{"text":"It was busy and smelled so good but the food was luke warm, okay flavor.  I think they could be great but they just didnt do it when we were there"}
{"text":"Good service and nice beer selection.  Food was just OK.  Best part of my meal was the cornbread."}
{"text":"Where do I start? From the moment I walked in I knew it was going to be a terrible experience. We had a reservation (which by the way, if you want a booth you have to state that in your reservation. I found that out from the snotty teenager who sat us)   A group walked in a head of us and they had a problem with their reservation, for some reason it took FOUR people behind the hostess stand to try to resolve this issue, while the lobby backed up and everyone else was ignored. We finally make it to our table and after a solid 8 mins out waitress greets us takes our drink orders and leave, we figured since we had ample time to look over the menu we'd be able to put in our appetizer order, but I guess that wasn't an option. She was more attentive to the group of 8 and the group of four around us, I guess our tip wasn't good enough? 25 mins after our original reservation time after we've received our drinks, the waitress asked all the tables around us if they'd like to put in a order and continued to walk right but us. I'm not sure why I had to stop her and ask her if we could put in our appetizer order... but we did and 20 mins later we got our appetizers the Burnt ends were good (not worth the aggravation though). An hour after we sat down we are putting in our dinner order (we requested that we put in our dinner order after we finish our appetizers, because we didn't want everything coming to the table at the same time). Our waitress disappeared quite a bit over the hour and forty five mins this adventure took. Our drinks were refilled once (oh and she asked when she put down our check if we'd like a refill). This place isn't worth the aggregation. The bbq is over priced and really mediocre at best and  service is terrible. I wouldn't go out of my way to come back, which is a shame, there was a lot of hype around this place and it just didn't live up to the Michael Symon endorsement (maybe the Chesterland one is better?). Overall I would have rather thrown $100 out the window, at least it would have been put to better use."}
{"text":"We have been waiting for this place to open for months. It is really worth the wait. My husband said the ribs were excellent.  He ordered a half rack and was satisfied with the amount of meat on them. The corn bread was also is a big hit.  Salads were fresh.  They have a wide selection of Beer and bourbon.  High marks from a food snob!"}
{"text":"Starts the meal with the deviled eggs with bacon jam and fried green tomatoes which was very good!   I have been to the Oak and Embers in Chesterland and the food is the same.  I prefer the Hudson location, as it is much roomier and comfortable.  The bbq chicken salad with avocado ranch was delicious.  Great place to get together and have a great bbq meal."}
{"text":"Service: 4/5 Good or great service. Sometimes you will wait but only when it's jammed packed  Food quality: 8/10 Real BBQ in Ohio. Smoked meat flavor is fantastic. Sause is the boss. But the catfish is bad and should not be on the menu because it is bland. Short rib, ribs, burnt ends, pulled pork and loaded grits are all baller. Short rib is the best thing I've eaten there.  Extras, Drinks, and Bourbon selection: 5/5 My Lord, if you like Bourbon come here.  Overall: 17/20 It's very good and I would go again, but don't get the catfish."}
{"text":"Great BBQ, nice atmosphere.  I just wish they had a bit broader menu.  I would love some wrap selections."}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten at the new Hudson Oak and Embers several times since they have opened. Overall the experiences have been good. Occasionally we sit at the bar and eat, which is an accepted practice at most restaurants. Tonight, the guy next to me asked the bar tender for a styrofoam cup, which the bartender then asked: \" Is it for what I think it is?\" He said yes, and the bartender obliged. Really?Unfortunately for my wife and I we had to sit there while this guy loaded his mouth then continued to \"SPIT HIS CHEW\" into the cup while we ate. Disgusting!! Hopefully management will read this post and advise their bartenders that spitting chew into a cup at a restaurant might not be the kind of image the owners had hoped or planned for? There are several townie bars in the area that this guy could frequent that don't serve food at the bar that he could \"sit and spit\". I hope they would agree. 5 for food,,,,1 for this experience."}
{"text":"Great first experience! The place was clean, the food was good, & our server, Theresa, was very personable. The hours on Google say that they're open until 10pm, but they stay open much later, as does the kitchen. It's a great addition to the neighborhood & we look forward to going back."}
{"text":"The portions were large and the food was good.  The lighting seemed a bit bright and was missing some coziness.  The beef brisket was very good.  The dirty grits were recommended as amazing and seemed just okay.  Overall a nice night out."}
{"text":"The renovations to the restaurant are absolutely beautiful, they did a fantastic job! I agree with the comments below. Hostesses can use some training, say hello, welcome, ect. Took some time for them to even look up and acknowledge the three of us.  Were seated in the bar at a high top table, not bad. No we did not have reservations, did not think to call to make one being a newer restaurant they usually do not take them when first opening. Had a wonderful waitress who was very  attentive. Two of us ordered the pulled pork sandwich with fries, very good, pulled pork was perfect, yummy fries, and the bbq sauce was awesome, wish they would sell it. Third person had the fried chicken wrap and loved it also. Will return!"}
{"text":"I've eaten lunch here a few times and I would love to say I've tried everything and it's all excellent but i have been stuck ordering the same thing every time because it's soooooo good!!  I highly recommend adding smoked chicken onto any salad - you will not be disappointed :)."}
{"text":"Outstanding new restaurant in Hudson the food is a little expensive but it's good they have an excellent selection of craft beer on draft as well as Bourbon and other drinks the patio is nice in the places roomy in Friendly"}
{"text":"Barbecue, Bourbon, and Beer is their tagline, but I feel they only  do one of these well. I've eaten a lot of BBQ in the Carolinas, TN, TX, St. Louis, etc. And I was disappointed by this place. The concept is great, but they need a little help with the food.   I visited for lunch during the week after Christmas. It was not overly busy and we were able to get a table right away. The decor in the restaurant creates a great atmosphere and they keep it classy with brown paper on the tables, like a real BBQ joint.   I'll start with the high point. Their beer selection is amazing! Lots of craft brews and plenty of local stuff. They have rotating taps and their selection changes quickly. They also have a great list of bottled beers. They are listed on Untappd as a verified venue, but when I went their draft list wasn't up to date.   Their other schtick is bourbon. They have a decent list of standard bourbons, and even do flights, but there wasn't anything overly special in their list. Being so close to KY it might be nice to carry a special bourbon made just for them - just a thought if they want to really attract bourbon connoisseurs. They also do an array of bourbon cocktails, but I didn't try any.   Finally the barbecue. I will say it looked amazing and presentation was beautiful. I started with the burnt ends appetizer. The plantains they were served with was a different touch, but done well. The burnt ends themselves were not dry and had a good mix of meat and fat, but it was hard to taste the flavor of the meat, because it was drowned in sauce. For my meal, I ordered the half rack of ribs, mac & cheese, and dirty grits. The ribs were decent, not quite fall off the bone, but texture was ok, and definitely not dry. It was again difficult to taste the flavor of the meat, because it was once again drowned in sauce. The mac & cheese was average, and you could barely taste the cheese over all of the cracked black pepper. Lastly, the dirty grits... these could have been amazing if it the flavor wasn't completely over taken by flavor of the cracked black pepper - the texture of the grits were creamy, the chorizo, corn and other flavors were a nice add, but I just couldn't get past the over-powering pepper flavor.   I would come back, but only to enjoy a few beers at the bar and maybe give some of their bourbon cocktails a try."}
{"text":"The Black Bean Burger is shit! It was mushy and squeezed out of the bun. I realize that this is not a place for non-meat \"burgers\" and everyone else food looked great and they all really enjoyed it so I am not slamming the place. I am only posting this in case you end up with a non-meat eater in your group. If I end up there again I will try the fish. The place was cool and the service was great. I did not complain, what should I expect from a BBQ joint veggie burger?"}
{"text":"First time there, had previously been to marcelitas, and have to say this is a world apart.  Decor is great, really like what they have done with the update.  Huge patio area and outdoor bar, will be a big hit once they get some tables out there I'm sure.  Only complaint about the facility was the music, which was a bit on the loud side and modern country, which not everybody likes.  Might be better to pick something with less volume and more neutral like blues.  We had smoked chicken wings and deviled eggs for appetizers, both were very, very good.  Entrees also good.  My wife had the smoked chicken salad which was amazing, I recommend.  I had the BBQ - brisket had good flavor, but was pretty dry.  Ribs were great as was the pulled pork.  Good smoke penetration on the meats.  I'm on the fence about the BBQ sauce, wasn't bad, but nothing to write home about, somehow was hoping for more from it.  Amazing bourbon selection.  Deserts looked great as well, but didn't leave any room to get to them this time  Overall I  would recommend this place.  There are probably a few hiccups (dry brisket and other things mentioned in different reviews) being newly opened, but look forward to trying out other items on the menu, which was pretty impressive overall, and I will definately be back, and likely more than once.  We weren't there for sports, but if you're looking for a place to watch a game, look no further, this is probably the best sports bar in a few miles radius at least"}
{"text":"Fair at best. Pasty Mac and cheese. Fatty roast beef sandwich. Service was fine and good beer selection. Sorry, we'll never go back."}
{"text":"Busted on a Friday night.  We had a very short war time for a table and service was quick.   Calamari was a bit thick, but overall good.  I had the chicken and waffles, which was very good.   This is not a complaint and I didn't feel rushed, but we were in and out so quick that I didn't feel that I enjoyed the experience.  However, I will return again."}
{"text":"A nice addition to the area with an extensive craft beer and bourbon menu. Wonderful selection of delicious pulled pork, brisket, and ribs with excellent sides. We like the apple slaw. It does have a sports bar feel with several dining rooms adjacent to the bar area. We have had good attentive service every time we have eaten there."}
{"text":"We have such limited options in Hudson for dinner out and this is a welcome addition. I have been here every week since the opening. Food is incredible. Great beers and the staff is super friendly. What they did with the interior of the former restaurant is also a sight to be seen. Love this place."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our lunch today.  Chicken Nachos are very yummy (a little overly messy, but yummy). My hubby has had 3 meals from this awesome BLT.  Looking forward to going without the kids!"}
{"text":"This has to be among the most bland, tasteless BBQ I ever had.   I tried the brisket and sausage combo.   Both were close to tasteless with a too sweet BBQ sauce.   Even the sides were dull.  Nice service and good beer selection but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Chriozo meatloaf was tasty. Pulled pork was good. Burnt ends were gross.. maybe we had a bad batch but they were extremely fatty and drenched in BBQ sauce."}
{"text":"5/25/18   One of my favorite restaurants in this area. Nice craft beer and extensive bourbon selections. Ate on the patio at the bar. Awesome look. Service was very slow and orders/requests forgotten several times. Wait staff nice though and it was very busy.   Food was outstanding as usual. BLT deviled eggs have a delicious and unique taste. I don't often order salads as an entree, but you certainly can with the barbecue chicken salad and you'd be happy you did.   The ribs are very meaty, the bones are good size and the sauce very tasty. Ordered 1/2 slab of baby back ribs. Must have had 10 bones! Comes with two side dishes. The dirty grits and smashed potatoes are to die for! Also comes with cornbread, which is more like a pastry."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, amazing servers, fantastic food and drinks, I'd eat here everyday if I could."}
{"text":"Went to dinner tonight and sat  at the bar right away.. waiter was excellent and drinks were right away and food faster than expected. What was even more was the taste! We had the burnt ends, brisket and baby backs. All were excellent and now just ordered the Creme'Brulee and am anxiously awaiting it's arrival! Stay tuned"}
{"text":"After living in the Carolinas I've missed some good BBQ - thanks for bringing home back!"}
{"text":"After my experience last week at the bar, I will not be back. I went there when they first opened & was not happy with the service at the bar. We felt ignored & like they didn't want our business. Fast forward 6 months later we decided to try it again. We sat down at the bar, and the one bartender gave us menus & walked away. No hello, nothing. After 5 minutes we ordered a drink, followed by food. Meanwhile a couple sat down next to us and they got a- Hi guys how have you been? So, because I'm not a \"regular\" I don't get a hello?? When our food came out I received the wrong thing, and not once did either bartender acknowledge it. The server that ran the food took it back & brought me the correct dish. While we were eating not once did they ask if we needed anything else. We quickly left afterwards, I was done.. the service at the bar has completely ruined my opinion about this place, which is sad because I do like the food. But I will not return after this."}
{"text":"We went for lunch on a weekday and found the entire experience to be perfect. The portions are large. The taste is heavenly. The presentation and service are exceptional. The ambience is bourbon themed industrial farmhouse. It is clean and spacious. We will return."}
{"text":"Alright, I know that Oak and Embers is known for their BBQ, but my very favorite thing to order here is actually the Tavern Burger.  I am obsessed with brie cheese and this burger is topped with brie cheese and Hungarian peppers which are kind of like a candied pepper.  I honestly just get it with the cheese and it's delicious!  They make sure the whole burger is covered in cheese and do not skimp.  I also love to get the sweet potato fries on the side.  This was my first visit to the new Hudson location and it seems like a great addition to the area.  It was nice and spacious and I think the outdoor area will be really fun once the weather warms up.  I will definitely be back again for a beer and my Tavern Burger!"}
{"text":"Large portions of sub par food.  Our waiter Dave was attentive however and the Basil Bourbon drink exceeded expectations."}
{"text":"We went for dinner on a Friday night with 2 other couples. I called the day before and was able to get a reservation for 6 at 7:45 in the bar. My husband and I arrived early to check out the bar, and our table was ready at 7:15. We had a great seat to see the bar and the baseball game! I had the grouper and it was good! My husband has the brisket and it was ok, pretty dried out. But the sweet potato fries were good and so was our service! We will go back and try again in the future!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and concept. Horrid service and extremely loud. Waited 1-1/2 hour for table and still wasn't seated. Couldn't get service from bar either. It may be a good place down the road but it won't get any money from me. Had to leave and get served at another restaraunt."}
{"text":"We went here for Valentine's Day and it was great. I hadn't been here before as it's a fairly new restaurant. I made a reservation through Yelp and everything was ready when I got there. The restaurant looked really nice. I had been there before when it was a different restaurant and they did a great job making it their own.   I ordered the smoked chicken taco appetizer, a house salad, and a side of cornbread. Holy cow the tacos were amazing. Salad was a good salad, and the cornbread was good too.   The cornbread is really sweet. it literally has a layer of sugar on top. It was different, but pretty good. The only complaint was that the avocado ranch dressing I ordered for my salad didn't taste like anything, not even like ranch anymore. I would recommend a different dressing, but otherwise everything was fantastic."}
{"text":"Location,appears to be in Twinsburg, not Hudson. No matter. Interior is nice. Not sure what they're doing outside. Construction took long enough, that they could have laid some sod between the sidewalk and the exterior patio. Junk out back was unappealing as well. Food, menu and service all,average. Missed opportunity to excel."}
{"text":"My wife and I came up here for lunch on Saturday afternoon. Our server, Heather suggested the O&E nachos. (Brisket) They were wonderful. I had meatloaf. My wife had bbq chicken. Our sides were cheddar smashed potatoes, green beans & onion rings. The food was great. The server, Heather was good to guide us through the menu."}
{"text":"Decided to visit this place for lunch.  The inside is decorated with a woodsy but industrial vibe.  The menu has a lot of options.  So I decided to try the ribs.  They were tender with a Smokey flavor and the sauce was tangy sweet.  You will not be disappointed.  The portions are good and the service is great.  Don't forget to try the Dirty grits.  Great flavor!  This would be a great place to take your family and/or friends!"}
{"text":"The first time was something of a novelty I had one of their sandwiches and I thought it was OK. The second time, the dew was off the lily so to speak as the food was just passable and I was very hungry. The third time did the trick; I couldn't finish the food I ordered which this time was the Meatloaf with BBQ sauce. Horrible! Weird texture and is tasted sort of like chemicals. So I tried a couple of ribs which my son had ordered. I wouldn't serve them to my guests. The meat was dry and it fell off the bone, which tells me that they may have either boiled the ribs before smoking or they just overcooked them. It's hard to believe that this food is cooked on premise and not actually prepackaged stuff from a restaurant provider. The bar looked like fun, but I'll never find out. I've been there for the last time."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday night. You definitely need reservations. I would plan at least 3-4 days out.  I have been to the Original location in Chesterland and the food is comparable. This is the best barbecue place in the area!  Everything I have had I really like. I would recommend to go with their staples. Brisket, ribs, pulled pork. You really can't go wrong. Their sides are also excellent and you get generous portions. I will say, that I had the green beans, which were really good at the other location. They were just okay at Hudson. The sweet potato fries were amazing and my son loved his Mac and cheese. My daughter really liked her fried chicken and waffles as well.  I have had the burnt ends and wings before as well and they are tremendous!   They have a solid beer and bourbon selection and the service was good.   You definitely won't be disappointed at Oak and Embers Tavern!"}
{"text":"Was expecting more aesthetically when we arrived. Had a very garage/Harley Davidson feel to the building. Service was great. The food was very average, but portion sizes were definitely generous. Probably won't go out of our way to eat there again."}
{"text":"What ever happened to customer service? Tonight we came to try the NEW Oak and Embers for our dear friends birthday. When I called to make the reservation, I asked, \"may we bring a small cake, and could you keep it in the cooler in the back?\" I was told, \"no problem.\" We showed up early for our reservation and we were poorly greeted. The hostess could not/would not put this very small cheesecake in the cooler. She then tried to sit us at a table that was practically in the lobby. There were multiple tables and booths open throughout the dining room and I asked for a booth. Completely screwing up her plan, she went back to her iPad and was visibly aggravated to sit us somewhere else. I said to my wife, since we both come from a restaurant background, me being a GM in a previous life, \"I'll ask the server! He will hide the cake in the cooler, at the very least, hide it in the back.\" I was wrong! Here comes your warning! If you get to meet Chad, I strongly suggest that you get up and head to a different restaurant! Drink menu? Nope, \"we're out.\" My wife asked, \"Cider?\" Chad isn't quite sure about that, as he's nose deep in his iPad looking for answers. \"Oh wait!\" He says, as he reaches into his pocket and pulls out his personal cheat sheet for us to look at. We asked questions about menu items, but he had no ideas about what may or may not be good to try. His response, \"I've never had it, it looks good though.\" \"That item is 86ed.\" Non restaurant people may not know what that means! I eventually asked if he was brand new? Was this his first day? Nope! \"I've been here since it opened!\" He exclaimed. Our friends bought a glass from the bar and he brought it while we were eating our appetizers. I simply asked, \"Chad, can you please bring that with our check?\" This is where Chad went off the rails. He responded with some smart mouthed comment about not pre-busing the table. We asked for the manager, she apologized and said she has spoken to him before about similar behavior and took 25% off the bill. She was nice enough but didn't really seem to care. The food was okay, but nothing that I couldn't live without or get elsewhere. Our friends steak we brought medium not well as requested. When we told Chad he left without the steak and had to check on something. The manager came over later without a plate to get the steak for a recook. We were done eating by the time she had her food back. I don't believe in participation trophies or patroning places that do not value customer service. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Please read the whole review.  It starts differently than it ends.  We (four adults and a baby) arrived at the restaurant just before 5:00PM.  We were told the wait would be 45 minutes (even thought there were SEVERAL empty tables, we were told those tables were for those who had reservations).   We felt the wait was doable.  They use texting to inform you of when the table is ready.  The text I received stating I was on the wait list was posted at 5:01PM.  Well, we waited, and waited.  In the meantime, the empty tables filled slowly, our fault, we did not have a reservation.  We were finally seated at 6:17PM.  Again, our fault for not having a reservation, but staff should have had a better take on the wait, 45 minutes that turned into 76 minutes is quite a difference, especially with a baby.  Once seated our whole experience there changed.  Our server was on us immediately, acknowledged the fact we waited a long time, and was aware the baby had waited quite a while, as well.  He arranged for the baby to get some milk and a few dishes quickly, which caused a near cranky kid to be quite calm.  We ordered appetizers, which also came quickly.  The Burnt Ends and Nachos, recommended by our server, were very tasty. The main meals included pork ribs, a shrimp plate and fried chicken were all well received.  I was the one ordering the fried chicken, which I enjoyed but was a little different.  I stole a couple of my daughter's pork ribs and they were moist, tender and seasoned very nicely.  Too often rib restaurants make their name with bold flavors.  With these ribs it was nice to actually taste the meat.  The baby (26 months old) loved his mac and cheese, cheesy succotash (I also ordered the succotash as a side, very good). and ate different things from all our plates.  He enjoyed it all.  The other thing we enjoyed was what the Manager did for us.  Our server told us the Manager was also aware of our wait, and did something very nice for us.  I won't say what that was specifically, but it was a classy move.  Thanks to the wonderful food, our incredible server and the Manager's gesture, we will return to this restaurant, the next time with a reservation,"}
{"text":"The place looks cool, follows all the modern \"rustic\" restaurant decorating guidelines. Good beers. Unfortunately the \"BBQ\" tastes like steamed meat. Flavorless drowned in disgusting sauce. An insult to barbecue.  How can you say you smoke your own meat but there is no smokers to be found and the meat tastes like it came out of a combi-oven?  Man this is pathetic..."}
{"text":"I loved it! I had the half rack of ribs and enjoyed it. My husband had the catfish and felt that the serving size was smaller, but tasted good. I'd say stay with the smoked meats to choose from. I think this is a place is a good place to celebrate and not really a quiet romantic dinner place. And make reservations!!"}
{"text":"We were in tonight and unfortunately the fire alarms went off which went on for a decent amount of time until the fire department came and then we had to wait outside for 10 minutes. After going back in, our food obviously took a while to come out since the staff had to catch back up. When it was time to check out, our server brought us a full priced check so we asked for a manager. The manager brought the check but didn't say anything or apologize for anything that had transpired. We noted that paying full price after everything that happened didn't seem fair and asked her what she thought would be more appropriate. After adjusting the bill to 50% off which was nice of them, the manager had our server deliver the check instead of bringing it back herself. Bottom line, our sever Theresa was amazing but the management did not handle this appropriately from start to finish. Food as always, when it came out, was really good."}
{"text":"very fun atmosphere , food was fantastic! very large portions and decent pricing. would recommend to someone who loves to eat! The chicken and waffles were amazing, the waffles are made of cornbread. also, the mussels were awesome. we also go brisket and ribs. The ribs were some of the best Ive had (smoky flavor)"}
{"text":"Maybe I'm a little biased since I love the original location in Chesterland, but the first experience at the Hudson location was everything I could have expected.  This is a BIG place with a BIG bar and lots of people.  The crowd was mainly middle aged, Hudson crowd you would expect, but the atmosphere was fun.  They did a 180 degree turnaround from the Mexi joint that was in its place before and went all out on design and features, including what looks like it's going to be a huge patio.  There are inside and outside seating at the bar, and TVs are huge.  The food is likely what brings you here, and in my opinion will keep you coming back.  Portion size is bordering on 2 meal status, but more importantly it's good.  Like really good.  My brisket was fall apart and had a nice bark to it, and the 7 slices gave me lunch the next day.  Fiancé had pulled pork and loved it.  The sides always play an important role in barbecue and they had plenty to choose from, including mac and cheese and green beans.  The cornbread served with the meal surprised me, since my first experience in Chesterland was a little tough, but they must have figured it out.  A great addition to the Hudson dining choices, and a choice we'll probably make often."}
{"text":"My first time here was the best!  Friendly hostess and excited staff!  Came here for a lunch with my mom and sister.  I started out with a bourbon slushie.  I LOVED it!  I highly recommend that!  Oak & Embers nachos were our appetizer.  I stuffed myself on those!  They were so delicious!!!!  Then I decided on the chorizo meatloaf.  I want more!!!  So yummy here!!!  Worth every penny!!!  Service was fantastic.  I never had to ask for drink refills.  Clean and neat place!!  So much fun!"}
{"text":"From the wait for one of the three teenage hostesses to notice the four of us at the counter to the unfriendly manner in which we were finally greeted (\"Do you have a reservation?\" Instead of \"Hi\" Or \"Welcome\") and throughout the 2 1/2 hour miserable experience of waiting and waiting until finally receiving food a tad chilly to the touch, me thinks we will never return to this local establishment!  The Chesterland restaurant informed us in April that the Hudson restaurant would open in May. They opened in September with absolutely no fanfare. No grand opening. No signs indicating doors had opened. Now we know why! We arrived at 5 pm and were told the wait would be 30-45 minutes. An hour and 15 minutes later, we were seated.  The booze was served 15 minutes before the water--perhaps that is policy. Get 'em wasted and then the food won't seem so late ... or so bad!   The meatless baby-back ribs should qualify for the Mediterranean diet (no red meat!) and the fries were slightly limp-wristed with a soggy finish!  The  \"Dirty Grits + 1\" were great, but be forewarned...the +1 doesn't mean you get an extra ingredient!  It means an extra $$$.  Seriously?  Cheesy grits?   Get a good look at your server when she comes to take your order!  You may never see her again!  Ours finally swung by to check on us as we took our final forkfuls. She disappeared before we could express our concerns.  There are several other points I could make here, but I won't waste my breath...Don't waste your time with this place!  A HUGE disappointment!!"}
{"text":"Food was OK. Mac and cheese lacked seasoning alll yet the sweet potato fries were over salted. Service was friendly but very very slow to get food."}
{"text":"Does not live up to the hype. Burnt ends are a major let down, I've never seen that much fat on a plate. Service is extremely slow (50 minute wait for a salad and shrimp and grits).  Food was average at best. On the plus side, they have a good beer selection. Won't be back."}
{"text":"This place was cool, I was expecting more.  It's quite nice on the inside.  We were seated pretty quickly, considering how busy it was on a Thursday evening.  We ordered drinks to start, a Suffering Bastard and Spiced Pear.  They were both pretty weak, though the Spiced Pear had better flavor. If you've ever been to Porco Tiki bar, this Suffering Baster doesn't compare.  We ordered crab cakes, which were good. They were just small.  I would have much preferred 2 larger cakes to 3 small cakes.  SO ordered the ribs with sweet potato fries and onion rings.  The rings are battered and not breaded (which is a big deal to me lol, breaded always cuts gums).  The ribs were pretty tasty as was the cornbread they brought out.  I ordered the brisket and was immediately disappointed.  It was dry AF!  We didn't even finish it. Thank goodness I had my dirty grits and mac & cheese to keep the hungries away.  We did get a second round of lackluster cocktails: he a gin & tonic and I got the Devil's grandma.  We decided to skip dessert since we weren't impressed with the offerings.  Service was adequate and the atmosphere was fine.  But if I want upscale BBQ, I'll probably stick to Mabel's."}
{"text":"Very impressed. Cozy. Warm feeling. Service great. Food was made to order perfectly. All staff was amazing. Other patrons were respectful. Definitely would go back again"}
{"text":"This place is beautiful!! Huge selection of craft beers and bourbons! The bartender was very knowledgeable and selected the perfect drink for me! The Burnt Ends appetizer was so delicious! I can not wait to go back and try an entree!!"}
