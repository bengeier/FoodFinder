{"text":"This place is amazing. My fiance and I tried it for the first time today for breakfast and can't wait to go back. Breakfast in general is difficult to do badly, but it's also difficult to do it this well, and Mark's Cafe does just that. This is some of the best breakfast in the area. Forget your chain restaurants and come here. The eggs (we had over easy and scrambled) are some of the best we've ever eaten. Her waffle, which I recommend, was definitely the best part of our meal. We saw a couple people order the pancakes, and all I can say is good look finishing them. We overheard the waitress telling a table that only one person has finished 3 of the pancakes at a time. Challenge accepted the next time I go back! Speaking of the waitress, the entire staff is just as amazing as the food. My coffee was never more than half empty, and they even brought me one to go. This could be due to how small and homely (British definition not American) atmosphere. I love the feeling this small diner has. There was a bit of a wait, but it is definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Excellent. Great service and great menu. One warning though. The pancakes are ginormous. I would estimate that one of their pancakes is the equivalent of 3 anywhere else. However they are fluffy and delicious."}
{"text":"First time here. It was delicious. Service was great all the staff is nice and helpful. Ordered the short stack and man o man they were big."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming here for years. It used to be named the culinary cafe. The eating area is small so I'd stick with groups of four or less. The recently renovated the place and the decor is much more modern. It looks great and inviting now!   The staff is always friendly. I love that you can here the chef singing in the kitchen. You can tell he loves what he does and it reflects in the quality of their food.  I always get their eggs benedict. They have several varieties that sound amazing but I always go for the regular version. I could not ask for a better eggs benedict. LOVE IT! My mother ordered the raspberry french toast this morning. I had a bite... SO GOOD! My dad ordered chicken fried steak. He ate the entire thing so he must have enjoyed it. The food comes out fairly quickly but not too quickly where you question how much of the meal was made prior to ordering.  I have only eaten breakfast here but from what I hear, everything they offer on the menu for breakfast, lunch and dinner is delicious. I recommend trying this place. Also, they do cooking classes here! I've always wanted to attend but haven't gotten the guts to try it. I would love to learn the chef's hollandaise sauce recipe..."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best breakfast spots I've found in Tempe. Service is super friendly and honest! Food is amazing, don't pass up on the Benedicts or muffins! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite brunch spot. I have been here 3 times now and another visit is scheduled for next week. Mark's has been consistently good. I appreciate the tasty food and attentive service. On our first visit, my husband raved about his chicken and waffles. I have tried the ultimate eggs benedict and French eggs benedict, both delicious. On our last visit my husband and I shared the breakfast wrap and banana pecan pancakes; both tasty but our favorites are the eggs benedict (they have a long list of variations of this classic dish) and chicken and waffles. Whatever you decide to eat, you really can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love getting Breakfast at local owned businesses. We try to go almost every week. Lately, we've been a little underwhelmed with our selection in Tempe, and have been haunting Denny's. No bueno. We looked to Yelp to see what we may have missed and found Mark's. And I think we now have a new default place! Great Hollandaise, just like previous reviewers suggested. Tangy, sweet awesome! I had the French eggs benny on a croissant with prosciutto. Holy taste buds!  BF had a spicy version, the Southwestern eggs Benny, and he loved his too. His only beef was wanting more of the potatoes they serve on the side. Compared to some of the humongous waffles and pancakes we saw coming out, eggs Benedict was a really tasty, but smaller portion. Especially after our Grand Slam slumming at Denny's. Overall - Mark's Cafe is delicious, local and full of friendly staff and patrons!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness.  I was looking forward to trying this quaint little place.  I finally got a chance to stop by.  Unfortunately, I was not able to eat.  Before ordering I asked where the restroom was.  I was directed behind the counter and through the kitchen toward the back.  Imagine my horror when I saw food being cut up directly adjacent to the bathroom (which was filthy, by the way).  I could not believe it.  A metal table that they use to cut up fruits and vegetables was right next to the bathroom door.  You can literally stand in the doorway of the bathroom and touch the food they were cutting!  Plus, food such as onions and perhaps potatoes were stored on the floor right next to the bathroom.    I am sorry, but I cannot and will not eat in a restaurant that prepares food in such close proximity to their toilet."}
{"text":"We were looking for a new place to have brunch this morning. For me, that means breakfast food at lunch time, not some buffet serving squiggly seafood. Luckily, Mark's serves breakfast all day.   The hollandaise and Eggs Benedict were mentioned highly and were part of the reason we decided on this place. By my count there were 9 versions of Eggs Benedict, and they are so accommodating, you could probably get any combination you preferred.  Did I mention accommodating? Excellent service, family owned business where everyone seems to have a vested interest in the business.    I must say I was hesitant to order anything with the hollandaise, because I make a really good hollandaise, and usually I'm disappointed with the sauce anywhere. I must say this is a very close second to my own sauce, and the best at any restaurant in memory.  We tried the Irish, French, and Neptune EB. The hash on the EB, was some of the best at any restaurant, I did think however that the heavier taste of the hash, overwhelmed the light lemony flavor of the hollandaise. It was good, I nearly licked the plate, but I'm not sure it highlighted two good ingredients into greatness. My recommendation would be to start with the plain hollandaise, and work your way from there.   I also ordered a Banana Pecan Waffle. This had fresh sliced banana cooked in a cinnamon syrup. For some reason, I had pictured more like a banana nut bread waffle, not a regular waffle with banana and nuts in top. That was my misconception. I enjoyed the waffle and brought the last quarter home for a snack later. The syrup that the banana and pecans are cooked has quite a bit of cinnamon. It reminded me of the sticky sugar created when you make cinnamon rolls.    Of note, they offer many flavor combinations of tea and coffee. I had the iced ginger peach tea. It was really refreshing and flavorful and they give you a cup to go if you ask.  My son had the Irish Cream coffee. I could smell the vanilla and Carmel notes of the coffee.   Some of the other Yelpers mentioned Christian music, I didn't notice any music, or it wasn't blatantly playing.  But really, does it matter? If the food is good enough (it is) I wouldn't care if they were playing monk chants. In looking for a restaurant on Yelp, someone else was complaining about the Metal being played at another establishment. Proof you can't please everyone.  It is a small place, I wouldnt recommend large parties without giving them some warning."}
{"text":"Wow, just wow.  Delicious food,  amazing staff, fast and fresh. Can't wait to go back!  I was having a rough morning and within 5 minutes, the staff had turned my day around. Left happy and full!"}
{"text":"I am writing this review while still sitting at the table... The customer service is so friendly and sweet! I wolfed down the Grilled Muffin trio (incredible) and fell in love with the Tomato Basil Soup and grilled cheese...CANT WAIT TO COME BACK"}
{"text":"Absolutely delish, great food, great staff, overall excellent dining experience! I had the chicken and waffles...AMAZING. You get tons of food for your money, and it's hard to eat it all. I am from Utah, but will def be back!"}
{"text":"First time here and it was amazing!  Best eggs Benedict I have ever had and no words for the grilled muffin! I love supporting family owned businesses and will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Like other reviewers, I found the staff to be friendly and efficient.  The restaurant itself was clean and pleasant...although I could have done without the bible quote written along side the daily specials and the \"have a blessed day\" upon leaving.    They had a few portable tables and chairs set-up outside but I'm not sure why they had the ketchup and strawberry preserves sitting on the tables in direct sunlight...this is Arizona...in the summertime...think food poisoning?    My friend ordered the corn beef hash breakfast to which he said it tasted like canned corn beef.  I, on the hand, ordered the chicken fried steak....hmm.  In full disclosure, I ate everything on my plate as did my friend; however, by no way is that an endorsement for how great the food was because it wasn't...the food was just ok.  My eggs were great...the potatoes were bland (sprinkling parsley over top seems outdated and didn't add anything to the plate)...the chicken fried steak was serviceable and the gravy was ok - it lacked pepper and was too thin for my taste.  The best part of the meal was the English muffin with the strawberry preserves...yummy!  I  enjoy supporting local businesses and this business is obviously doing something right since they've been in business for the past 11 years.  I'm glad I went and I wish I could say that I can't wait to get back but for now all I can say is, \"Been there.  Done that.  Next.\""}
{"text":"Had lunch at Mark's today.  It feels like something right out of Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives.  Great food, low key atmosphere, friendly service.  I ordered the Black Forest hot sandwich and it was excellent!  Roast beef with swiss, Russian dressing, grilled tomato, and bacon on rye.  The bread was griddled just like a good hot sandwich should be.  Nice and buttery.  I loved their french fries with the skins on.   Great little neighborhood joint for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"Mark's Cafe is by far the best breakfast place in the area. The food is great and the service is phenomenal."}
{"text":"Hands down the best brunch place that I have visited in the Phoenix Valley.  It's local, family-owned, and the service was friendly and exceptional.  I had the Neptune Eggs Benedict.  They used REAL crab meat, and the hollandaise sauce was perfect for me - light, like the way I like it!  The bottomless coffee that we had was incredible value for the money.  The wait staff including Mark's daughter must have come back to refill our mugs 10 times.  We also had one of their incredible muffins (apple strudel) which they grilled and served with butter plus their raspberry sauce (their own recipe).  Everything was just great.  They were also very nice to let my friend and me sit there for a couple of hours even though the line was out the door (we were meeting up to catch up after not seeing each other for a long time).  My favorite breakfast/lunch place in the Valley by far for the above reasons.  I will go back again and again."}
{"text":"I love this spot and everything you order is almost always spot on! Amazing food and people and quantities and qualities. Reminds me of the places in Massachusetts I grew up around where they personally attend to your cravings and deliver :) steak and cheese!"}
{"text":"We used Mark's Cafe for a departmental recognition breakfast of 50 people and I cannot begin to explain all of the compliments we received on how great the food was. Mark and his team arrived on time for set up and breakdown of their equipment, they were fast, efficient, I mean there truly aren't enough nice things I can say... And on top of all of that, the pricing was sooooo reasonable!! It's safe to say we will be using Mark's Cafe again! Thank you for everything!!!"}
{"text":"What a great new discovery in my hood. Driven by here thousands of times, but never stopped....Big mistake! Extensive menu, great taste, super friendly folks. We'll B back for sure. Thanks Karen & Mark for a great birthday brunch!"}
{"text":"We have now been to Marks Cafe multiple times and have enjoyed each visit equally. The food and service is outstanding and the atmosphere is relaxing. My only grip is that it is a little small. Food is worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, cozy atmosphere, it feels like going to an aunts house around the holidays for a big meal. Lots of people, but you feel important, and people you barely know are happy you are there and like their cooking. There was no hesitation to substitute items either (food allergies). This is my defacto Tempe brunch spot."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to stop at Mark's for quite some time and finally made it. Definitely was not disappointed. Service was great, food came out quick and hot. If you like biscuits and gravy I would recommend the chorizo gravy. Very flavorful and not too spicy."}
{"text":"The only reason I give this place a two is because the waitress works hard and is great I ordered the country fried steak over Cooke with potatoes still half raw and eggs sunny side up also raw with a pool of grease and two links over cooked this is the second time I've been here second time I've been disappointed how does mark call himself a chef"}
{"text":"Hard to give this an accurate review. I did expect the staff to reflect the number of stars so when our food and drink orders were taken after the people who came in after us, it was a little annoying. We then grabbed the attention of the young girl with dreads and asked for water, not knowing it wasn't default. I don't think we saw her smile once, other than laughing when a party of 6 came in. About 10/15 minutes later (real time), we got our food (after the other table) but still no water. Watching the girl float around the diner, doing this and that, it was also frustrating. Then we took a bite of our food and all was saved, for the most part. The chicken fried steak was the most tender I've ever had. Don't even get me started on those eggs and English muffin! So incredibly good, it definitely tamed my hunger monster. All in all, the rest of the staff (the two waitresses) that we came in contact with, was very kind and friendly. Something you always look forward to, when going out, but especially going to a small place like this with such rave reviews. Who knows, maybe the girl is just new (an \"In Training\" button wouldn't hurt). I understand that with a small café, everyone has to wear at least two hats so with that and the memorable food, we'll probably be back."}
{"text":"WOW! This place is such a gem! Amber is kind, funny and really welcoming. She really made my experience unique and one I'll never forget. The pancakes are larger than a human face. I couldn't even finish one. I'm not sure if two people could finish one. The biscuits and gravy were soooooo delicious! They have many different kinds. I got 1/2 plain and 1/2 chorizo. I honestly can't wait to go back and visit again!"}
{"text":"I wish I had time to add a review but couldn't because the whole freakin restaurant smelled like PUKE! I had to leave, couldn't stand the stench."}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast place there is!! I'm impressed with the variety of options the menu offers and every thing tastes amazing!! Definitly recommend this place, you're missing out if you haven't tried it. Try the country frittatta it tastes amazing!"}
{"text":"Go eat breakfast there. Diane is a fantastic server and Mark makes delicious food. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I popped in with a friend and my two year old daughter for breakfast at 10:30 on a Saturday morning.   The wait was only as long as it took to bus a table, and even though the place is small, no one waited longer than 3 minutes to be served. The wait for service was a little longer.  The staff was immensely patient with my 2-year old, bringing a coloring page and crayons to the table and even miniature pitchers of milk to pour into her cup.  Drink orders were taken immediately, but our food order wasn't collected until about 10 minutes after we were seated. Then we waited quite awhile for our food. 2 couples that arrived and were seated after us got their food before us. Luckily, the food was worth the wait.  My daughter got the 1-egg breakfast with an egg, sausage and home-style potatoes. I got the traditional eggs Benedict with home-style potatoes and my friend had 2 pancakes (syrup, bananas and pecans on the side) eggs and home-style potatoes.  My food was delicious and served hot. If I lived in Tempe instead of North Phoenix this would absolutely become a regular haunt."}
{"text":"The Hubster & I have been on a Tour of Arizona Eggs Benedicts and we currently have Mark's Cafe as #1 for Traditional as well as Specialty! Personally as a Breakfast joint if you can't make Eggs Benny... Then you shouldn't have a Breakfast Menu!   #1.The Traditional has a VERY NICE slice of Heaven... Ohh wait I mean Canadian Bacon compared to what other un-named places call a \"slice\".   #2. The Hollandaise Sauce... If I could ask for a To Go Soup container of Marks Hollandaise Sauce I would totally do it! Its magical... I'm not sure what he does differently but its easily the best Ive ever had!   We prefer Brunch vs. Breakfast so one morning we drove in to Tempe from Gilbert (Far I know! LOL) & arrived at 1PM for Breakfast. Even though they close at 2PM there wasn't a single bit of rushing us at all, unlike those \"other\" places. The food has been PERFECT every time, no matter what we order!   Menu Recommendations: Traditional Eggs Benny, Southwestern Eggs Benny (I prefer it with the English Muffin vs. Biscuit), The French Benny *Special* Croissant w/ Prosciutto... Lets say OMG! Banana Pecan Pancakes, Cajun Chicken Club w/ Cajun Fries!   This Local, Family Owned & Operated Restaurant.... ROCKS! Its worth the drive where ever your coming from! ;-)"}
{"text":"After seeing all the 5 star ratings we decided to give Mark's a try this morning....that was a mistake. The hubs ordered pancakes, bacon & eggs while I got biscuits and gravy. The pancakes are massive, but quantity does not trump quality in my book. Seriously the worst pancakes ever, dry, cakey, and tasted like bisquick. The bacon was thin and pitiful and looked as though it had been cooked in a microwave. My biscuits were \"ok\" but they also tasted like bisquick. Only redeeming part of my breakfast was the gravy, it was loaded with black pepper so it has a nice spice to it. All in all I think we'll stick with our usual joints, The Good Egg or Matt's Big Breakfast!"}
{"text":"First time here. Brought the (newly vegetarian) daughter.  Full house but a couple open tables so no real wait. Busy so it took a few minutes to take our order but definitely understandable.  THE waitress, and I say that because I think she's the only one, Amber is phenomenal!   And I'm not just saying that for the service she gave us but also from watching her with the other customers.  Daughter ordered the Spinach salad.  She said it was good.  I'll take her word for it.  Bonus; there was bacon on it so I got that!  I had a Belgium waffle and a side order chicken fried steak with country gravy.  Waffle was very good.  Gravy was also very good (tried a sample before ordering).  The steak was THE BOMB!  If that thing was frozen I'll eat my hat.  Batter wasn't too thick and the steak was so so tender.  I could cut it with a fork and it just melted in my mouth.  Can't wait to come here again."}
{"text":"Nice neighborhood breakfast cafe.  Lots of breakfast options and reasonably priced.  Daily specials are worth a try.  If you arrive early, they are understaffed and service suffers.  Friendly but slow due to only one server when we arrived."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, server's were friendly and they got my order right the first time. I'll be coming here more often."}
{"text":"While you won't find Mark's cafe on a \"best of breakfast\" list don't let that detour you.  They must not have eaten here because the Scottish Eggs Benedict with salmon and hollandaise sauce was amazing. Much better than some upscale places I've been to over the years.  Definitely worth your time and will impress!"}
{"text":"Marks Cafe is absolutely AMAZING!! We visited on a Saturday mid morning and it was crowded, but we only waited about 7 mins before we were seated. Once seated we reviewed the breakfast/lunch menu, there is a so much to choose from. I had the BLT with fries and a side salad, my mom had eggs, bacon, speciality eggs, hash browns and muffins, both meals were absolutely delicious. Portions were huge, more than worth the money. The staff was awesome, special shout out to Amber! The basil mayo \"OMG\" delicious! Happy Birthday. She was amazing, so much personality. Thank you for making our Saturday amazing."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely wonderful. The super friendly and knowledgeable staff, delicious food and generous portions sizes make me want to eat here every day! I only wish we had found them sooner, so many wasted meals elsewhere, ha."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast! Staff is very friendly and a great home town place. When you visit, you must get at least 1 muffin!"}
{"text":"You guys, this place is A-mazing! Tired of the same ol' same ol' breakfast options? Then you gotta try this place. Clever and tasty breakfast combos, as well as standard fare, are available. Coffee was good and refilled constantly. My husband and I travel all over the east valley looking for breakfast joints; this one is now our favorite. We were warmly greeted upon arrival, and our waitress, Amber, had a great personality and offered tasty suggestions from the menu. She truly is \"The Taste Bud Whisperer\". We will definitely be returning!  Suggestions: try the grilled muffins with raspberry butter; try one of their benedicts; arrive before 10 AM on the weekends to avoid the crowds."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Specially the grilled chocolate muffins.......Great Service, in all a lovely experience"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! The staff are always nice and welcoming and the food is always very delicious and fresh!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast one morning, great service and great food. Good size portions and delicous. SUPPORT LOCAL BUSINESS!!! Hang in there Mark, we're cheering for ya!!!"}
{"text":"This will be our go-to breakfast place every time we come to Phoenix. The wait staff is super friendly and attentive, even when short-staffed like today. Our server's shirt said \"Tastebud Whisperer\" and that's exactly what she is. My husband was having trouble deciding what to order, and she asked him a series of questions that was like a flowchart that led to the perfect breakfast order for him. (Chorizo Hash Benedict with some alterations). The grilled muffin is delicious, and my Irish Benedict was really good too. We love this place!"}
{"text":"I thought I'd give Mark's Cafe a chance seeing as how they're the \"little guy\" struggling to get by, however, lying to customers is the biggest fail imaginable. Our waitress, Mark's daughter, insisted that we have one of their famous homemade muffins that they make fresh every morning. \"We sell over a hundred a day and only have a few left,\" she bragged. I could see them sitting at the kitchen window and they looked suspiciously like Costco's muffins. As a former coffee shop/cafe owner myself I can pretty much spot a Costco muffin a mile away. She then rattled off the flavors, again each style sounded suspiciously familiar. I decided to try one, giving them the benefit of the doubt, but one bite into it I knew it wasn't homemade. I then googled the flavors and the google autocomplete finished each with \"costco.\" Ultimately, I got duped into paying $4 for a 50 cent store bought muffin. It's one thing to sell store bought muffins, it's another to lie to customers about it."}
{"text":"All I can say is GREAT Breakfast!!  I have had breakfast there 2 times and it was great both times.  The bene's are wonderful.  My boyfriend thinks they are the best he has ever had.  The grilled muffins are to die for....a must try.    The wait staff is friendly and efficient!  This place gets very busy but it is worth the wait.  I will be in the Tempe area soon and you can bet I will be there for another wonderful breakfast!!"}
{"text":"Mark's Cafe has by far the best breakfast I've had in a long time. The food was absolutely phenomenal. My omelet was so flavorful and rich, the biscuit was flaky and warm, and the sausage gravy was to die for! My boyfriend got a waffle filled with chorizo and green chiles topped with scrambled eggs and spicy gravy. Now, I am the biggest baby when it comes to spicy, but after trying a bite of this waffle, I was ready to keep eating despite the burn on my sensitive taste buds. That tells you just how delicious and flavorful this breakfast was.  We got to speak with the daughter of the owner and she was telling us all about Mark and his vision for the restaurant. They offer a New England style just-like-home breakfast with the bold flavors you find in the southwest. Nothing is ever frozen, every vegetable is hand cut, all the ingredients are bought from local farmer's markets,... You don't get a breakfast more fresh than that, and that freshness is so apparent in the taste.  The worst part was that we each could only fit in the one meal, but I cannot wait to go back and try everything else one their vast menu. There were so many options that all looked so delicious it was nearly impossible to choose. Often, when a restaurant has that many options, they can't specialize in any of them, but at Mark's, anything on their five-page menu could be the chef's specialty.  On top of the food, the service and environment were impeccable. Mark's is a real mom-and-pop shop that offers a comfortable feeling of home with delightful conversation. Everyone on the wait staff was kind, funny, interesting, and knowledgable. They were so personable and sweet and they genuinely cared that you had a good experience.  You would think that for such amazing service and even more amazing food, you would have to pay a pretty penny, but the prices were beyond reasonable. I was happy to pay what I did and then some. These hard-working folks deserve every cent.  Thanks a million to everyone at Mark's Cafe! You guys made my morning and I am already thrilled to head back next weekend!!"}
{"text":"Just tried to check this one out based on Yelp reviews but they were closed. Sunday morning 8:00 am. Bummer"}
{"text":"Mark's Cafe is Tempe's hidden breakfast gem! The service is top notch, being extremely friendly and making you feel right at home. Shoutout to Amber and her talent as, \"the Taste Whisperer,\" where she will as what you like, and recommend something that you may have never thought you'd try. The food here is extremely filling, delicious, and well priced, with many of the dishes having large portions to ensure maximum deliciousness! I had the \"country waffle,\" which is a large waffle topped with white gravy, bacon, ham, and fried chicken, and was immediately launched into tastebud heaven. The gravy really sealed the deal, and I recommend getting some dish with it, or getting some on the side.  I will definitely be coming back the next time I'm around town!"}
{"text":"Great food and super service.  Nice atmosphere and very convenient.  I wish they were open 7 days a week"}
{"text":"Mark's Cafe was amazing! Generous portions, friendly staff, excellent food. Can't wait to come back and try something new. Wish they were open just another hour or so later so we could go for an early dinner!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to Mark's at least a dozen times in the last 6 months. Fantastic breakfast spot. I've had a few of the different eggs benedict, but my all time favorite is the French Eggs Benedict - it's served on a wonderful croissant instead of an english muffin. Absolutely perfect.  We stopped by one time for their Friday night dinner, and truthfully were disappointed. After loving their breakfast so much we had high hopes for the dinner. While it was delicious, it wasn't quite up to my expectations; perhaps the breakfast set them too high. However, we will continue going back for breakfast as we can!  The staff is always friendly, and is quick to recognize you as a regular."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I live close by and wanted to try a new place for breakfast, so we found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try. We both had the eggs Benedict, one with salmon and the other with chorizo. We got them with the spicy hollandaise sauce, which was very good and I would definitely recommend the spicy over regular! The food was AWESOME. Loved their fries. The only downside was its very small, and the wait can be kind of long. Also it took about 35 minutes to get our food :( we were so hungry so that really sucked. We looked around and it looked like everyone's food took forever. They had the kitchen fully staffed so not sure why it took forever. Very limited seating so I would not recommend for any party larger than 4! We might go here again if we are craving the food, but I wouldn't come here just because. The food wait was way too long. Glad we tried it though :)"}
{"text":"Marks Cafe is literally around the corner from my house. For years I wanted to try the place out and I finally did. I wish I had tried it sooner! The food was amazing and the staff was so welcoming. I will definitely be back for more delicious food!"}
{"text":"We could not love this place more! Always busy on weekend, but always worth the wait. Waitstaff is so friendly and hard working. I always get California eggs benidect with spicy holindase, it is incredible. My husband trys something new every time and it's always amazing. My absolute favorite breakfast joint around, one day I will try lunch as I am sure it is spectacular too."}
{"text":"Mark's is consistently one of the best restaurants I've eaten at.  I am a semi-regular.  It's pretty simple: If you like eggs benedict this is the place.  My personal favorite is the Irish Eggs Benedict - which is basically corned beef hash re-imagined as a benny.  The fritattas are also fantastic. The strawberry preserves on the table is a nice touch also. Breakfast for two is around 20 bucks.  Support a local business, have a great breakfast, and skip the buyer's remorse so common among Denny's patrons."}
{"text":"We love finding rests rants that are hidden gems! So my best friend and I decided to try this place out!! They have an indoor and outdoor dining area, the indoor area is kinda small but feel homey feel. They were a little busy at 930AM when we went and only had one server so it took about 20 minutes to order. The food however.... Was amazing!!! I have the Raspberry French Toast and my friend has some kind of Spinch, Tomatoe and Oregano Fritata! I will defiantly eat there again, regardless of wait time! The staff was also very friendly and personable!"}
{"text":"Finally an answer to the age-old question:  where do I go when I really want eggs benedict?  Mark's Cafe has the best you will find!  They are properly made, delicious, and are offered in a variety of creative styles -- I really liked the spicy southwestern style.  Now, some of you are saying, \"wait a minute, I can get eggs benedict at almost any diner\".  If you are one of those people, then I'm sorry but you just don't know what this dish should be.  Hollandaise can not be made from a powder, as most versions are! Give Mark's Cafe a try and you'll be surprised discover (or re-discover) proper eggs benedict."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with my GF. Super-friendly (but not pushy) service, and good, simple food. Had the mulligatawny soup and the grilled chicken sandwich. Both very flavorful, served very hot. Bread for the sandwich was perfectly toasted.  If you just want lunch, and don't care if it's overly fancy, this is the place to go. Tasty food and a great all-around experience."}
{"text":"My new favorite breakfast / brunch spot. Where have you been all my life Mark? CFS was great and the portions were plenty large without getting ridiculous like some places seem to be proud of. Can't wait to come back and try something else next time."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  Biggest pancakes I've ever seen.    Manhole cover size.  Chorizo hash eggs Benedict. Awesome. Great friendly staff."}
{"text":"Wasn't greeting ever! Caught on there was a wait list at the counter you need to interupt the person there to get your name on the list. Food was average and portion average to small. I was put off by there only being one bathroom as in single room for the whole resturant and kitchen to share. Mom and pop operation was the best charm."}
{"text":"Mark's Cafe is the best kept secret in the Valley. This family-owned business offers delicious, reasonably priced food with awesome personalized service!!!"}
{"text":"Went to visit Phoenix fro Michigan and remembered this place from last time. It's been 5 years and was hoping it was just as good. Come to find out it still was. Our waitress was amazing and talked us into every delicious dish that we had. I always got a Benny here and it never disappoints. Also their grilled muffins are also good. They are even better with the homemade butters. Yes that was plural. They have multiple kinds. You need to go here for breakfast at least to start. You will not be disappointed and if you are I have no doubt that they will make sure they correct it to get you back in."}
{"text":"I read the menu with eyes as hungry as my empty stomach while the sole waitress in the restaurant participates in light hearted banter with a regular. Her voice cheery and enthusiastic. She turns as another customer walks through the glass door, the little white curtain of paper at the top of it shakes a bit in the wind.  \"How are you doing?\" A blonde girl with a soft voice and a silver hoop nose ring asks the waitress as her and her boyfriend help themselves to a table. He wears a fierce beard and a diamond stud in each ear, he stands taller than all of us, at least 6'6\" The waitress answers the generic but heartfelt question with a \"highly blessed and favored, can't complain. Got out of the bed this morning so I'm doing good!\"  She takes their drink order and weaves through the tables (a little too close together) gracefully and without looking down. \"What can I get for you hun?\" \"Can you do a half order of the French toast?\" I ask \"How about we just do the kids?\" She replies  and then in a whisper \"if anyone asks you're twelve.\" \"Perfect thank you, then I'll have the biscuit and gravy with the white sausage gravy, and that'll be all.\" \"Sounds good hun. Thank you so much!\" People this perky in the service industry usually annoy me but her genuine enthusiasm and obvious motherly passion for feeding people is charming and utterly enjoyable.  \"Hi pretty! Look at your beautiful hair!\" She runs after her sister who is walking behind the counter just arriving, possibly a little late for her shift.   My biscuits and gravy arrive first. Hot and delicious the biscuit is a tiny bit dry but I know it's a fluke from the few other times I've ordered this dish which has always been perfect previously. The French toast is simple but done well, no mushy bread in the middle. While I'm enjoying my meal I am also enjoying the music, not too loud, filling the small restaurant. Although I enjoy even more the cook working in the kitchen who I can see through a \"window\" in the wall, he's wearing an apron and a backwards black baseball cap. He is thoroughly enjoying himself and singing along to the music not trying to be discreet. His voice isn't necessarily pleasant but his demeanor is, and his body's bouncing rhythm and smile are contagious.   The food is fantastic yet humble the service is great, and the people working here enjoy themselves and the restaurant. It's really everything I need in a breakfast spot and will continue to come here when I decide to be late for work and treat myself to a morning meal."}
{"text":"I have no idea how I've never heard of this place before. I've lived in Tempe for 8 years and am always searching for new breakfast spots to try. I'm so glad I found this place today!  Wife had the French toast, kids had the pancakes, and I had the everything omelette. Everything was top notch quality and delicious. The service here is second to none. We'll definitely return again soon!"}
{"text":"I was visiting my daughter and decided to stop in for lunch based upon all of the positive reviews. Service and hospitality was 5-stars plus.......that's where it ended. The Cafe was only half full and our order took almost 45 min. My hamburger was bland (no seasoning), cooked to medium (ordered rare), the green chilies were flavorless and the bun was slightly stale with a soggy bottom. I feel very generous in giving a 3-star rating, but it's the customer service from the time we arrived to the time we said good bye that was outstanding.  Hospitality goes a long way and can sometimes make up for the lackluster and flavorless food."}
{"text":"So, we waited a while.....but it was sooooo worth it. We were stopping through on our way back home to LA and came based on recommendations.  It was so tasty.  We had the raspberry and banana French toasts and the California Benedict and the chicken fried steak.  Every single bite was out of this world.  I appreciated that every dish was different and better in some way than you can find elsewhere. The gravy was exceptional and we had it two different ways.  The Benedict was the best I have had and I am a big breakfast go-er.  Our waitress had a shirt that said, \"the taste bud whisperer\".  She was indeed.  She was the sweetest and gave us perfect recommendations.  And, everyone was so sweet and accommodating.  Thanks you guys!!"}
{"text":"I do not know exactly how many folks I've taken to Mark's Cafe (f.k.a. Culinary Solutions Cafe).  I can tell you that Chef Mark - with decades of Executive Lunch/Dinner experience - will blow your mind and \"ruin\" your palette.  Many of those that I have taken to this phenomenal Breakfast/Lunch/Catering cafe have gone back on their own - without me (when then can get away with it).  My favorite dish is impossible to identify, but my favorites remain any of the Eggs Benedict dishes, or the Friday Night Dinner's.  (BYOB!)  This is a perfect local spot to impress your clients."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service! Amber is an asset to this place, she is genuinely passionate about her efforts.  I enjoyed the food, the cozy atmosphere and it was even great to hear some Christian music on the radio.  The portions are HUGE so be ready for that.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Really great place for breakfast and great food.  A bit on the pricy side, but at the same time, it's not a run of the mill chain restaurant either.  Friendly staff and comfortable environment."}
{"text":"This tiny little place has big heart! The food is simply amazing and chef Mark's passion and formal culinary training comes through in every bite. Be prepared to wait a bit at peak times, but it will be worth the wait and you will not leave hungry. In fact, plan on finding somewhere to \"walk it off\". The staff is energetic and just as sweet as the homemade muffins.    Trust the reviews. This place is a real gem!"}
{"text":"Marks is a great family owned and operated place.  Try the chicken and waffles of your really hungry or just a omelet, either way fantastic food.   Be forewarned, the weekend are very busy and there is almost always a 15min wait; with a small restaurant and lots of regular patrons makes this a constant. Also since mark is usually the one preparing your dish the food takes a while. THIS IS NOT A PLACE TOO CONSIDER IF YOU ARE IN A RUSH AND JUST NEED A QUICK BITE TO EAT. Just sit down, get a grilled muffin and some homemade raspberry butter, and relax.   All that being said, this is easily a five-star place that is a neighborhood staple. They also have outdoor seating that is dog friendly!"}
{"text":"This place is a find! It's one of my favorite breakfast places. Every time I come, everything I've had here has been delicious! I'd definitely recommend everyone eating here. The staff is also always friendly. The only downfall is that the restaurant is small, cafe size so there's usually a wait but it's always worth the wait."}
{"text":"First time here and they had really good California Eggs Benedict. You could definitely tell that their hollandaise was homemade. Not a big fan of the homefries.. only because mine were deep fried  Not sure who our waitress was because different girls came to the table but they were all very nice and attentive. The lady who took our order said the banana pecan pancakes were the best but to me there was nothing amazing about them .. maybe that is why she said to take them home and add ice cream to them. Overall, good expirence.."}
{"text":"Tucked away on the east side corner of Albertsons parking lot. It's a small family owned business that doesn't mess around on the food. I got the chicken and  stuffed waffles and it was superb. It's good to find places that aren't too commercial for a solid breakfast"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best brunch restaurants.  Service was incredible and the food was even better.  We had a party of 11 and they did everything to ensure we were comfortable and satisfied.    I ordered the Chorizo wrap and it was exactly what I hoped for.  My buddies ordered the different egg Benedict's and nothing but outstanding comments.  Don't leave without ordering the muffins!!!  You honestly just have to go for yourself.  However the kicker...when you go, BYOB!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and i recently found this hidden gem and it is delicious.  It is now our go to breakfast place!"}
{"text":"Mark's Cafe is my hands down favorite breakfast place in Arizona. I know, kind of a big statement, but every visit here is a joy.  The food and service is always top notch. Bacon, cooked how you like it (we like it extra crispy) is always magical, and eggs made with perfection and care.   As a self-professed crazy food obsessed person, I love the variety, with their extensive menu. And trust me when I say - everything is good. I have tried a ton of their offerings from the egg benny's, to chicken and waffles, burgers, and numerous scrambles... There's nothing I have yet to dislike!  Mark's is small and warm, and totally has that shop  around the corner, mom n pop feel. Always cooked and staffed by Mark and his family, this is a true definition of an amazing local family business. It's comforting to see the same friendly faces at every visit, honestly something so rare these days. My husband and I are big fans and will happily support Mark's for years to come!"}
{"text":"Tried this out today, and fell in love. A great, smaller, mom and pop restaurant, with a very personal touch. The staff consists of family, and are extremely pleasant during all interactions. There's no freezer here - everything is made fresh daily by the family. And the food is deeeeee-lish! My only suggestion is call ahead, as they are smaller and fill quickly. We lucked out with a table outside to accommodate our size (6), but we heard the owners ask follow up customers if they'd called ahead. Will definitely repeat here, enjoyed the pleasantries on top of the heavenly food!"}
{"text":"Love visiting and supporting a local family owned restaurant. =) The staff is always very welcoming and friendly. =) My daughter LOVES their fruit cup, and it is so much better than the typical fruit cup.  Their eggs Benedict have to be my favorite, with the CA Benedict probably my most favorite. Yum!"}
{"text":"The girlfriend and I have been eyeballing this place for quite some time. We finally got around to it this morning, and our experience was nothing short of wonderful. When we first arrived the place was completely packed and we put in our names to wait. We waited about twenty minutes to be seated and in that time we struck up a wonderful conversation with a couple of regulars who were super nice. Finally we got seated and started browsing the menus. Everything sounded delicious at this point because of how hungry we were. Amber (marks daughter) was our waitress and after explaining that I had no idea what to choose, she made a suggestion for me and explained that she is known as \"the taste bud whisperer\". Let me tell you, her suggestion was right on par with what my taste buds were craving. Our overall experience was wonderful and we will for sure be back and will probably become regulars. Our food came out fast and hot. Everything was prepared perfectly, and the staff has a way of making you feel like family even if it is your first time there. I loved every aspect of it. Thank you guys for an amazing breakfast and setting an amazing tone for the rest of our day!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, everything was SOOOO GOOD. I had the chorizo waffle and it was BOMB dot com. Awesome family owned place, I even got a chance to say hi to Mark himself! 10/10 recommend and will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"We love this place. The waffles are amazing and so is their Greek Frittata! Oh em gee. Yum!!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! Great service and unique menu! The streusel is a must with the raspberry butter!  They also give the kids markers to write on the table which made them very happy and busy! We will be coming back! Every week!!!"}
{"text":"We tried Mark's Cafe based on other reviews on Yelp and we were not disappointed.  The servers are super-friendly and helped my husband decide on an entree based on his answers to their questions.  He usually never considers ordering a benedict, but he loved his chorizo hash benedict with chorizo gravy even though the biscuit was small.  My Neptune's benedict was also delicious with fresh crab and homemade Hollandaise sauce.  The crab was plentiful, but the sauce could have been warmer.  We both thought the home fries were fine, but nothing special.  Prices were a bit high, but the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Visited Mark's Cafe at about 10am this morning (Sun) with my daughter.  All the inside tables were taken, but the young lady at the counter took my name and said it would just be a few minutes as there were a few tables finishing up their meals.  As we waited, another couple customers came in and I heard one of them make a remark wondering why they weren't that busy.  I thought they were crazy since every table was taken and already a few of us waiting to be seated, but oh well (more on this later).  About five minutes later we were seated, drink order taken, and trying to decide on what to have from their menu.  So many good options.  Daughter ordered the breakfast wrap and I ordered the biscuits and gravy.  Our server was incredibly friendly and asked if I wanted sausage gravy, chorizo gravy, or half and half.  I was going to play it safe with just sausage gravy, but she made the chorizo gravy sound like it was to die for so I got the half and half.    Food came out in less than ten minutes and looked amazing!  Daughter loved the wrap and the biscuits and gravy was the best I've had in many years.  The chorizo gravy had the perfect amount of heat and the biscuits were light and fluffy.  Loved going back and forth between the two gravies.  So good!  Service was spot on with fast drink refills, light banter, and attentiveness.    As we left, we saw over a dozen people waiting inside and outside and understood the earlier comment about them not being busy when there were just a couple of us waiting.  I'd be willing to wait too with how good everything was.  Definitely going back."}
{"text":"I had breakfast with 11 other people here for the first time and we were completely blown away.  The service was spot on and my Scottish Eggs Benedict was amazing.  Everyone's food came out promptly and the server was very friendly and accommodating!  Everyone in my party raved about their food and asked if we could make breakfast at Mark's a regular thing.  We'll definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"This is my 3rd visit here. It is our favorite Sunday breakfast spot! It's a tiny corner cafe in a strip mall. Pretty nondescript (these are usually the best places)... Seats about 40 people inside and 12 on the patio. Skipping to the good stuff, the food!!!! I've not had anything here I didn't like! The pancakes are the size of hub caps, coffee is bottomless, service is very friendly and accommodating! If you like eggs Benedict, I highly recommend the French! It has prosciutto ham over a fresh croissant, topped with hollandaise sauce. Ask for the spicy hollandaise to give it an extra bit of a kick;) If you like scrambles/skillets get the kielbasa scramble.  Get there early, there is usually a wait by 11am!"}
{"text":"Tried Mark's Cafe for the first time today on a recommendation from a friend. One thing's for sure, you will not leave here hungry. I had the blue cheese bacon burger and it was incredible. It was as delicious as it was big. A very generous order of great french fries accompanied the burger. I look forward to going back and trying something different on the menu."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Mark's since the remodel. It happens to be just outside of my normal breakfast route, but I was close by today so I stopped in.  I actually had no idea they had the big redo till I asked the waitress if they had changed names. She had waited on me my previous visit so I had a feeling it was the same place.  They had a community renovation project to help them out, Awesome.  Anyway the updated decor is a good improvement and makes the place feel better and more comfortable.  They were packed this morning which was nice to see and I got my coffee straight away from being seated at the new bar counter area.  The staff was extremely nice and friendly even though they were really busy  so that gets a big thumbs up from me.  I had the California Eggs Benedict which is a step up from the usual Eggs benedict Florentine by adding avocado and tomato.  It was very good and my eggs were cooked perfectly with a very nice hollandaise sauce.  They do have strong diner coffee that will definitely wake you up which can be a good or bad thing depending on your preference for coffee.  Glad too see this place doing so well. I will definitely be back sooner this time.  I think I will be adding them to my normal breakfast route.  Keep up the good work.  Try:  - California Eggs Benedict"}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! Delicious food, great service, and affordably prices. This was our first time here and we're in love - pretty sure that we'll become regulars.   We received a warm welcome when we walked into the restaurant. The server was genuinely nice - she shared a few details about the menu, allowed us to pick our own table, told us to help ourselves to the white markers to write on the glass table, and let us know that everything on the menu is customizable and that they serve both breakfast and lunch at ANY time. I truly felt empowered to ask if she could make the iced Almond Joy coffee into a hot drink. She did!   The food! The delicious food! I ordered the biscuits with chorizo gravy, eggs, and bacon. The biscuits were light and fluffy and were served with a generous amount of chorizo gravy on top. The chorizo gives the gravy just the right amount of flavor without overpowering the dish. The waitress shared that they make their own chorizo and drain out the fat before adding it to the gravy which gives it the balance. The eggs were served on a different plate but I transferred them to eat them with the gravy. The gravy was that good!  My husband ordered the Chorizo Wrap (burrito). It included, egg, potato, cheese, pico, onion and served on sour cream. He said it was excellent.  The restaurant is a little small, it seats about 60 ish people but it doesn't feel crowded, it felt cozy. They were attentive and friendly throughout the meal. Our water and coffee was continuously filled. Neighborly.  I can't wait to go back next weekend!"}
{"text":"A cute little hole in the wall in Tempe. Our server, Amber, was exceptional. Made great recommendations with a pleasant charm & wit that made the experience one to remember. Will definitely return :)"}
{"text":"If I could give this place 10 stars I would! My girlfriend and I happened to be in the area and found this place on Yelp. Service was awesome and VERY helpful. I had a combo of chorizo hash eggs benedict and corn beef hash eggs benedict with the spicy chorizo hollandaise sauce. OMFG!!! The best eggs benedict I've ever had!!! My girlfriend had an omelet with broccoli, smoked sausage and two kinds of cheese and that was unreal! I can't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"I love this place!! I've been coming here for years but today is my first time with Jess.  It just keeps getting better every time! Amazing atmosphere, feels like you're at Home, GREAT specialty coffee drinks, and if you go- YOU MUST TRY ANY OF THE EGGS BENEDICT DISHES!!! DEFINITELY coming back again!"}
{"text":"Not what I had expected based on other recommendations. You no longer can BYO for mimosas. The wait was long and the food was average at best. The staff is friendly and helpful with choices but there are other restaurants in the area without the wait and just as good of food."}
{"text":"Why, oh why is this place so highly rated???  Mediocre food at best. My kids ate one bite of their pancakes and refused to eat more. They did rave about the bacon, so I had to order more so they wouldn't starve until lunch. I had the chicken and waffles. The chicken was hard and mostly breading and the waffle was tough. The bright side was the waitstaff. Everyone was very friendly and made the trip to this place bearable. The coffee was decent though. :-)"}
{"text":"Nice small town community feel, complete with a bulletin board full of cards and local gatherings when you walk in! Food was tasty (really enjoyed the apple muffin and Greek frittata).  Some lipstick on my coffee mug from the previous drinker and chatty wait staff are keeping me from a 5 star, but it was all in all a good meal. Definitely recommend to anyone wanting a new breakfast spot."}
{"text":"This is a good little breakfast spot. I love Eggs Benedict and they have a lot of options so thats already a good thing. Service was friendly, a little slow but not too bad. I thought the place looked pretty clean. Nothing stood out. I was enthusiastically recommended the spicy hollandaise, and it didnt taste bad, but i'm a bit of a purist, and i felt like the extra kick took away from the rest of the dish rather than helped it. But that's just my opinion.   *Update. Went here again this weekend after too long of a wait at Denny's and so glad we did! Got the Scottish eggs Benedict with the regular hollandaise and two big thumbs up for that! So good! My boyfriend got the Irish and he loved it too. Kids got the ginormous pancake that they couldn't eat all of. This place is really good. Would highly recommend over Denny's."}
{"text":"Good pick for a family owned breakfast/lunch place in Tempe! We stopped by on a Saturday to get brunch and were surprised to find a pretty small restaurant. The wait was only about 10 minutes (much shorter than most other options in the area) so we waited. Glad we gave Mark's Cafe a chance because our food was really good!  My fiancé ordered the Irish Eggs Benedict with spicy hollandaise sauce. He said that it was good and that the corned beef hash was tasty. I ordered 1 Neptune Eggs Benedict and 1 Scottish Eggs Benedict with 1 side of regular and 1 side of spicy hollandaise sauce ... because why not! I personally enjoyed the Neptune Eggs Benedict more as well as the spicy hollandaise sauce. For me, the regular one was a bit too tangy. The side of home fries that came with the order was very tasty as well!  We received good service while dining there. Our waitress was attentive and offered recommendations, came to find out that she is the owner's daughter & her husband works there as well! My only regret is not trying out one of the massive muffins that we saw others had ordered. Also overheard from a group who was trying to order mimosas that it is BYOB here. Overall, we're definitely likely to return in the near future!"}
{"text":"One of the best breakfasts I have had in a very long time!! You don't need a menu if you get the \"taste bud whisperer\" as your waitress. She will find you the perfect thing to eat and has the best recommendations. I had the country fried steak with half country gravy and chorizo gravy and it was delicious! If you are in Tempe, you have to check this place out!!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing and the service was excellent. The country fried steak was cooked perfectly and the chorizo gravy complimented it very well.  My wife had the eggs Benedict, over biscuits instead of the English muffin. She had it topped with Mark's homemade chorizo and loved it.  We will definitely be back and recommending Mark's Cafe to all of our friends."}
{"text":"Best breakfast spot ever! They give kids dry erase marker's to write on the tables. So cool! My fiancé and I also love the Christian music that they play! That's actually what sold us besides the delicious food of course!"}
{"text":"I will always remember the remarkable enthusiasm and energy displayed from  Amber,  our server!  She was super friendly and catering when informing us that they will customize any items on their menu.  With that said, I was able to try a sugar free chocolate cookie dough iced coffee!  The link sausages were a star being fresh, tender and not overly greasy!  The chorizo hash didn't shine so much for us but their blueberry pancakes with warm homemade compote was scrumptious!  In fact, I was told that I stated a few times, how tasty the blueberries and pancakes were!    I love non-chain places!   You can feel the warm, inviting family atmosphere that Mark, Amber and  Amber's husband naturally create.   The mood is contagious and you can tell the patrons leave with a full stomach and smile on their face!  I will return for more...... of both!!"}
{"text":"Exceptional service!! Food was great! We got the corned beef hash as well as the Belgian waffle and both were delicious!! Couldn't ask for a better place to stop before heading back home."}
{"text":"Every time I am back in AZ in good to Mark's for breakfast. My son meets me too. The food is constantly GREAT and the cook and the servers are always great too!! I travel a lot in US and Globally  and Mark's is Great!!"}
{"text":"In the short time that I've been coming to Mark's Cafe it has quickly become one of my favorite places in Tempe. From front of house to the faces in the kitchen window, the staff is bubbly and full of life; they never fail to brighten my day and make me feel at home.  My favorite item on the menu is probably the grilled blueberry muffin with fresh raspberry butter, but Ive loved everything I've had here so far. Amber, aptly named \"The Tastebud Whisperer\", has never failed to steer me towards a dish that hits the spot. I cannot recommend this place enough. If you're looking for a new hole-in-the-wall to call your own, look no further."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. I've been going here almost every weekend for breakfast since discovering it! My personal favs are the eggs benedict (any of the different varieties they offer) and their biscuits and gravy (always ask for sausage links, too!). Today I went in for lunch and discovered they have amazing burgers as well! Get yourself a cheeseburger with cheddar and ask for some basil mayo. Best burger I've had in ages!"}
{"text":"Mark's Cafe is the breakfast place you never knew you needed. Tucked away in a remote corner of a typical, Phoenix, non-descript shopping mall, this little gem is easy to miss.  A family owned business, it's clear that much pride is taken in the service it provides of feeding the masses. Two huge things to love about this place.   First, the menu. It's extensive!  No shortage of options and everything is made fresh. I had the quiche Lorraine, which did not disappoint.  The dessert for my breakfast (don't judge me) was the Apple strudel muffin. My only regret is that I didn't lead my meal with this.  The raspberry butter provided the perfect bit of tartness to balance out the sweetness of the muffin. Just perfect. Couldn't finish it. The upside is I get to enjoy it again later.   Next, the service. I felt like I was at my friend's parents' house with said parents doting on me. My coffee and water were never low.  And my high maintenance (yeah, I'm self aware) style of \"extra this, but none of that\" requests were encouraged. Our waitress, Amber who is Mark's daughter was amazingly attentive and helpful - without it being \"too much.\" Seriously, Amber, can we just hang out sometime?  You're way cool and genuine.   The only downside to this place is that it's small so there may be a wait, but you can call ahead."}
{"text":"Service was fantastic and amazing food. Great little  gem in Tempe. Fair warning,  the pancakes are enormous!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Let me first start off by telling you about how incredible and personable the staff is! Christina and Amber are the best and by all means, let Amber guide you too the best plate of food you will ever eat. She knew all the right questions and suggestions to make my chicken and waffles delicious. The sausage gravy and chorizo gravy are a must. Deff come check this place out. Whatever the wait is, it's worth it."}
{"text":"We found this place on yelp when crepe bar was closed. Wow how happy are we! It's a very small place,  about 10 tables inside and a few on the front side walk. The food is awesome. I had the spaniard omelette and my friend had the quiche. We will be back again. The service was very good."}
{"text":"While I've eaten here in the past and the traditional Eggs Benedict was fabulous, today I decided to try the Southwestern version which comes with chorizo instead of ham. The spicy chorizo completely overpowered the rest of the plate, drowning out the flavors of the eggs and hollandaise. I will certainly not order that dish again, but rather go back to the traditional version.  The service was just ok, not especially friendly, but our drinks were kept filled. Make sure that if you eat here you have time to wait for your food because it is also not fast.  ~JS"}
{"text":"Was in Tempe for Spring Training. First time at Mark's Café.   Small place Come early as it can get very crowded, as i was told. Excellent service. Amber explained what was on the menu, the specials She was EXCELLENT!   Food was great..i had poached eggs, bacon and potatoes. I will definitely comeback next time I am in the area."}
{"text":"Its my wife's favorate breakfast place the pancakes are great and the hash browns are amazing. I get the eggs Benedict and they are very good. Just a small place so might have a bit of a wait"}
{"text":"Food was good, freshly prepared and enjoyed it..... One of the reasons for the lower rating was the wait.... Took over an hour to be seated and almost 30 minutes to get my food and ordered a salad.... Now I typically am not apposed to waiting a bit longer for food especially if the quality is good which Mark's does have. The issue that I had was the expectation that was set when we put our name on the list was a 25 minute wait... They seem to have a capacity issue since since they moved our table physically twice to accommodate others..... Until they resolve the waiting/ expectation issue I would be hesitate to return until it is addressed....   One opportunity they may have is since this location is at the end of the property they are renting is to possibly create a drive thru window to address some of the capacity issues....They may have to manage the preparation process differently but just an idea......."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service!! They really make you feel at home. Our waitress was super friendly and upbeat. Definitely surpassed our expectations. Can't wait to go back and get risky with my food choices."}
{"text":"They have great service and fast delivery. My office orders lunch  in from them a couple times a month. Every time, I try something new from the menu, and every time, it is just mediocre. The food is just whatever. It's not super delicious, but it's not nasty ever... It just never quite satisfies the way you'd hope."}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast I've had anywhere, honestly.  The eggs Benedict are amazing (get the spicy Hollindaise?, it's fantastic) and my life was incomplete until I had their grilled muffins. Plus, everyone who works there is very friendly and accommodating.  We come here at least once a month."}
{"text":"I love this place. It is a must have if you are in the area. The servers are amazing and always attempt to remember everyone's name when you are a regular. Their food is very very good. I have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I've never had so much fun and enjoyed the wait staff as this place. The food was phenomenal and you could taste the in house recipe and freshness. This is a must visit breakfast spot. Family-owned and Beyond fresh."}
{"text":"You would miss this place if you weren't looking for it as it is nestled away in a corner, but definitely glad I was looking for it! The staff is extremely pleasant, on top of things, filling coffee as needed an offered suggestions when ordering as a first timer. I had the California eggs Benedict. A buttery croissant topped with smoked salmon, sautéed spinach, avocado, tomato, two poached eggs and their spicy hollandaise sauce. Perfection. Or, as the waitress suggested \"life changing\". I also had a pumpkin muffin to start which was grilled adding a crunchy,  caramelized awesomeness. I will definitely be back and will bring some friends to tackle the raspberry French toast."}
{"text":"Amazing fresh food made with love in every bite. I had the chorizo eggs Benedict and every bite was better than the last. Mark's Cafe is small but packed with love by all the employees who want to make sure you enjoy the experience as much as they do."}
{"text":"My place to get cup a coffee on the way to work on the morning, they have a very good coffee, and they also have good services that I did not wait for long of my coffee that only a few minutes in-n-out. I used this place for my coffee before hit to work and I plan be here often for those coffees that I liked. I truly recommended!"}
{"text":"This is a very small, friendly restaurant with big portions. The Friday dinner menus changes from week to week. Mark (chef and owner) seems to take pride in his restaurant and food, if you are lucky you may also hear him singing in the kitchen. Bring your favorite wine or beer in on Friday night as this is a BYOB restaurant. There is no corkage fee if you do bring your own wine and they have wine glasses available, but if you are bring beer, bring your favorite beer glass as they do not have glasses for beer. The food was fresh and well prepared and really had homemade quality. This restaurant is so well liked in neighborhood and by the regulars, that many volunteer came together to help this restaurant reopen and remain in business, that says a lot about this neighborhood gem."}
{"text":"We were lucky enough to land the food whisperer waitress and she was positively a hoot!  She convinced my husband to let her order for him and she was spot on.  She asked me if I liked basil and promptly brought me basil aioli for my fries - YUM!  I had the tuna salad sandwich which is not something I ever order but it was fabulous (and do the croissant if you get a sandwich - trust me - you'll love it even if you're dead inside).  Unfortunately, I couldn't take the rest of my sandwich with me because we were out shopping all the day and tuna + hot car = no bueno."}
{"text":"What a great little surprise in Tempe! I pass by a lot and didn't notice it. It's a small diner on the corner far end of the Albertsons plaza on Rural and Guadalupe. Luckily it faces Rural.  I heard about this place from a couple friends who know the owner Mark. I'm so glad to have bookmarked and made the visit. They specialize in Eggs Benedict among many other items. They even have freshly made muffins. I had a bite of the chocolate one, served warm with a raspberry infused butter, and was Delish!!!  Mark is also up for the challenge of any requests. I stuck to the menu and had the vegetable frittata made with an option of egg whites. Really good.  They serve breakfast and lunch and open early at 7:00am daily.  The only downside here is that there are no customer bathrooms. Other than that, I would highly recommend giving it a try especially if you're a lover of a good breakfast."}
{"text":"Friendly family environment, I eat alone a lot and they let me sit and read my book and enjoy coffee before my meal.  I can only speak to the breakfast items and have loved everything I have eaten here.  I do love a good hollandaise sauce and Mark makes a few good ones.  Also, the eggs are cooked perfectly!  It is always clean and usually busy, but that busy never interferes in the awesome attitudes of the whole staff.  Thank you Mark's for being a class act!"}
{"text":"This is a tiny popular spot. We went once with friends who were in town. WOW!!!   There is so much to choose from, better study the menu before! I however did not and took forever to decide. Once we all had finalized our decision the waitress came over and told us the best way to order how to have it cooked. She was spot on. I did not know they could do a frittata. I had ordered a bowl, but she suggested the frittata for the combination I ordered.   This ingredients were perfect. The vegetables were perfect. I could have used less cheese, but this is a personal preference. If you asked dh, he would say it was not enough.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Small family owned cafe. We went and it was busy but got a seat at their small bar table. Wife of owner busy working and super friendly. Owners kids work there too. Slightly under staff during busy time but they apologized and food makes up for it. Nothing fancy but good food. Try the chicken fried steak or corn beef hash. Everything looked appetizing though. Could use an upgrade or larger space."}
{"text":"I just love this place. It might be small. It might be crowded. But, damn, are the folks here ever so nice. To me, it's well worth a trip to Mark's Cafe.  The last time I was here, I only had to wait 5 minutes for some bar seating. Despite how full the cafe was, the servers were friendly, polite and on top of their serving game.  I already knew that I was going to get the 2 biscuits and half/half (chorizo and classic) gravy order, with a side of sausage. After I placed my order, along with coffee, it only took about 10-15 minutes for my meal to arrive. It is sooooo good! I was fairly stuffed, by the time I was done.  There's bar, indoor and outdoor seating. The place is fairly small. When I showed up, a party of 10 took up about half of the room. A tight fit, if you plan on going with a large group.   Even if this is a drive from where I work and stay, while I'm in town, I think it's worth it. My overall experience is excellent. Keep up the awesomeness, Mark's Cafe!"}
{"text":"Great, little neighborhood spot. I'd love for them to expand or take over a larger location.  Their claim to fame is the variety in eggs Benedict, and it is true, lots of variety.  But what I find most unique is their take on muffins.  One, they are huge.  Two, they are sliced down the middle and put on the grill and served warm.  They come with different flavored butters.  Worth a try, but plan to share as the portions are HUGE."}
{"text":"They have the best muffins in the world!! They cut the muffin and put it on the grill!!!! Everybody has to go there and eat the muffins! If you don't go there and eat the muffins you crazy"}
{"text":"As an LA native I find it difficult to love an eatery in Arizona. No offense but the food out here is just very limited in taste, flavor, and variety. But after stopping by here, I have definitely found my breakfast joint! First off, I love eggs Benedict with crab. The only place I've seen it excel in is San Francisco. But this place does it well. The sauce was amazing too. We also had the country fried steak ....  wow! Fire. So good and I've never been a fan of breakfast potatoes but they know how to make me like them! I also had one of their breakfast muffins, hot and fresh. I did like the muffin but I didn't like the strawberry butter or whatever it is. It's their specialty but idk it tasted a little strange. As far as ambiance, it isn't the nicest, but you are going for the food not the look. Would recommend for sure !"}
{"text":"This place was okay. It was a standard breakfast cafe, if you ask me. Its a good place if you have people who want breakfast and others that want lunch. Service was good and the food didn't take very long."}
{"text":"First time in! The food was great! I ordered a basically philly cheese with au jus and great fries! I didn't care for the cheddar I think a white cheese like Swiss or Romano etc would of been better. My boyfriend ordered the black Forrest! It was amazing. The hostess was very cheerful and friendly but it did take a while to get refills in tea and the final check but all in all will definitely try again!!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst chicken fried steaks I have had. The quality and taste was that of a TV dinner, luckily their gravy helped mask the penurious quality of what undoubtably is a frozen then refried piece of cardboard breaded with the tears of those who have ate this dish before me. The home fries were not thoroughly  cooked and the over use of spice out weighed everything on the plate. Needless to say it was a feeble attempt at a country fried steak and eggs breakfast. I got a water which was good old Tempe tap water. At least get a filter or something. The service was good and prompt but did not make up for the lack luster breakfast I received. I will not be returning. Being a small hole in the wall joint I had such high expectations for this place and was sadly let down."}
{"text":"The staff went out if their way to take care of us. Food was absolutely amazing. Just a small local place. Best Eggs Benedict I have ever eaten in my life!!"}
{"text":"Mark's cafe is one of those places that you pass by at a strip mall unsure of what kind of restaurant it is, you know those places that don't pique interest unless you stumble upon it on yelp? It doesn't lack character, it's the curb appeal that throws you off because it's not much to look at from the outside but inside meaning the food, it's worth exploring and enjoying. Went with a friend on a random Saturday brunch/breakfast outing. S wanted a place close to home, so, I looked via yelp, and noticed Mark's had good reviews and stars. Read somewhere it's a benedict kinda place.   Anywho, the staff was friendly, endearing, and welcoming. They have a wide selection of omelettes, benedicts, and lunch items. They also have many special items, and from what our server told us, they accommodate special requests since Mark has a knack for coming up with good eats. I got the Ultimate Benedict, which comes with prosciutto, tomato, spinach, and avocado over a croissant, with either regular or spicy hollandaise, I recommend you get the spicy because it's not spicy per se but it has this smoky full flavor that grows with each bite. What I love about this benedict is that it's layered on top of a croissant, so, the bread just soaks up the sauce and all the goodness. I also got a single stack pancake (which is the size of the plate, so, get one if you're getting it as a side), and they have toppings, so, our server's recommendation was to get the banana pecan, my friend got the banana pecan combined with the blueberry compote. It was all delicious, and I'm adding Mark's to my breakfast rotation. P.S. they have more than tabasco if you're looking for a spicy condiment, just ask. Happy eats!"}
{"text":"Our 1st time here, service started out sketchy our 1st 10min or so but the \"Tastebud whisperer\" stepped in & made all the difference! Food was delicious & service was great after all! Place is very small & had quite a few families on the waiting list by the time we left at 10am on a sat. We will definitely be back time & time again!"}
{"text":"We always have great service here. Try the muffins and raspberry butter..I especially like the apple muffin. The Irish bene's are tasty. Be careful ordering pancakes. One will feed the whole table. Homemade yummy goodness!"}
{"text":"I had a little extra time before going to work so I finally came back to Mark's Cafe and ate breakfast at the restaurant.  This time I had the chicken fried steak, scrambled eggs, home fries and an English muffin.  A very hearty breakfast the chicken fried steak was juicy and had a nice crispy coating even with the gravy on it.  The country gravy is very tasty.  Real bits of ham and very flavorful.  I came on a Friday right when it opened and got seated right away.  My food came fast and the waitress made sure to keep our drinks full.  Mark (and I believe his wife, the waitress) thanked us for having breakfast there and wished us a good day.  I love little spots like this and I will try their lunch menu next."}
{"text":"Food was good.  The wait was ridiculous!  Waited 30 minutes for a table for two, sat down and waited another 20 minutes to have our order taken and another 25 minutes to get our meal.  Not cool.  Talking with the floor manager, she suggested that we call ahead and get our name on \"the list\", so that we don't have to wait as long.  I hope they get their logistical issues worked out because I really wanted to like the place!   People were really nice!"}
{"text":"Whenever someone asks me for breakfast recommendations in the area, Mark's is always on the short list.  We've been there a few times and have tried the protein platter, unruly omelet, B & G with half and half gravy, and the country frittata.    First, both types of gravy are good, but the chorizo gravy is exceptional.  You have to try that.  I really enjoyed the frittata as well, along with the English muffin with homemade strawberry jam.  Very nice.  I found the unruly omelet to be a little dense and dry, but I took 2/3rds of it home as leftovers and turned that into a nice scramble of my own.  I want to go back and try the waffles, pancakes, and muffins, but I usually opt to drink my carbs instead of eat them.  We'll see.    The food is great & in generous portions, and the service is fast and friendly.  We always enjoy breakfast at Mark's."}
{"text":"Staying in the area for the holiday's and found this place on yelp. It was the picture of the eggs benedict that convinced me this was probably a great local eatery. I had the chicken fried steak with half country gravy and half chorizo sausage gravy and wished I'd done all Chorizo. It was fantastic and made to order. Service was amazing. The waitress was a gem, full of spunk and energy, plus great insite to the food, which made it easy to order as a first time customer.  We will hit this place up again on our next trip to Phoenix."}
{"text":"First time in this morning and I had a chocolate banana iced coffee with the chicken and waffles. I'm definitely going to back. The staff and service were excellent and the food delicious. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal! Choice of food is amazing and if it is not on the menu Chef is so diverse that he will make your tastebuds scream with his skills! Highly recommend taking a muffin to start and you have to try the homemade hollandaise sauce regular or spicy you cannot go wrong! I will definitely be a returning customer here!"}
{"text":"In town from out of state and decided on this spot for Saturday brunch due to positive Yelp reviews and its proximity to our hotel.  The place was packed and people kept arriving, we had about a 15 minute wait for a table.  I loved the classic diner feel to this restaurant as the servers were laid back, the menu was traditional breakfast items with no fuss, and we could even write on the table while we waited for our food!  We were immersed in a hilarious game of hangman so the time flew.  We ordered pancakes, the Denver omelette, and toast.  The homemade strawberry jam on the table was fabulous and paired so nicely with the warm, crunchy, and buttery toast.    Beware- the pancakes are bigger than your head!!!!  A little more quantity over quality on those so they fell a little flat, no pun intended.  The server suggested that we take the extras home, heat them up in the oven, and enjoy with vanilla ice cream.  The Denver omelette was well prepared and definitely not dry, however the green peppers seemed like they were from a can.  Coffee was consistently offered to be topped off and they even offered me a to-go cup for mine at the end of my meal- nice touch!  If I lived in the area, this cafe would definitely be part of my regular weekend brunch rotation."}
{"text":"Mark's Cafe is a small, inside/outside diner with friendly servers and amazing food. As my first time here, I was impressed with how quickly we got sat and got our coffee. I asked whether the bearded man on the menu actually looked like Mark and the waitress laughed and said yes. Mark is actually her father! Plus her daughter and husband were also working - a real family business!  I got the special of two eggs, two bacon strips, and French toast instead of pancakes. Plus, the waitress offered to put some cheese on my eggs, and listed a bunch of options including feta; I of course chose feta. Before I had even drank half of my coffee, our food was there.   Everything was hot, delicious, and made to order. I'm very happy about my experience and will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I love this place . It's small and family owned . The servers are so sweet and they still use the old fashion ways of taking orders !   My boyfriend lives down the street and this is one of our go to breakfast spots . We are huge breakfast people and this place always serves us great food  . He usually would get one of their speciality waffles and I always get eggs Benedict's . I usually try a new one every time we stop in but every single one I have tried I have loved"}
{"text":"By far my favorite breakfast restaurant. I have been here on several occasions and every time I leave satisfied. This last time I had the eggs benedict with chorizo hash. It was not spicy and the poached egg was cooked perfect. My boyfriend and I love the homemade muffin trio: apple, lemon poppy and chocolate combo is a must!   My only complaint is since it's so small, there's a waitlist that forms so you could end up waiting 30-45 min. Overall the food never disappoints and everyone staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"This is tucked back into the corner of a shopping plaza. Very small but super delicious! I had the biscuit with Chorizo Gravy. That was so good. We also had California Benedict. And Belgium waffle. The ambiance was good. But again this is a small place so if you want a seat I would recommend calling ahead to see how busy they are. Happy Eats!!!"}
{"text":"I was in town visiting some friends when we decided to stop here and eat. Its a cozy little area, which makes it feel homey. All of the staff were SUPER friendly & energetic. Since they were busy they recommended us to do the quad of muffins, which was half of each muffin they have. THEY WERE DELICIOUS. The Apple Crunch type one was my favorite. They also asked how I wanted my bacon, which most eateries don't do that, they just give you one type. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Traveling through for work. Saw the good reviews and decided to give it a go. What an excellent idea.  These amazing reviews don't do it justice. Fantastic food, awesome and entertaining service, and just an overall killer atmosphere. Consider it a destination breakfast location. My server took my order then made awesome suggestions to make it even better. Couldn't recommend it enough."}
{"text":"Stopped in today with friends for brunch at this local family restaurant. It's tricky to find as it's the last small shop in a strip center, facing Rural. We had the place to ourselves since the main rush was over. The service was excellent. They were happy to customize our orders how we liked them. My wife and her friend had the egg frittata which they really enjoyed. I had a biscuit and gravy which was good, but perhaps not great. I would have liked perhaps a bit more sausage or pepper in my gravy. I also had the banana, pecan pancakes.  First, the pancakes were HUGE!  At least 10\" in diameter. The toppings were mixed in a bowl of goodness that were delicious!  Can't wait to go back and try something else.  Check out the pictures."}
{"text":"5 Stars!!! This place is legen--wait for it-- and I hope your not lactose intolerant, because the second half of his word is--dary!  Amber delivers rockstar service.  Only wish is if they had a better way to organize the wait on the weekends with a small space (pagers maybe).    Perhaps they would be interested in a partnership where we can park a food truck serving the menu to help manage the huge demand on the weekends while maintaining the same excellent quality."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place to come to, tried the southwestern egg Benedict's and loved it! The pancakes were huge and really good! Customer service was the best overall very attentive severs! Definitely will be back and very family friendly!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for breakfast for years, remains a favorite. Homemade hollandaise, regular or spicy. Country gravy, sausage and chorizo. Ongoing specials, great waitstaff. Amber, daughter of Mark, leads the front of the house, and will guide you through a wonderland of great food.  Pancakes are massive, chorizo hash is tasty and unique. Show early on weekends to minimize the wait!"}
{"text":"Honestly loved this place and would take all of my out of town guests here. However, after today I'm okay with not going back. We had not one but 3 small hairs in our food. The waitress was nice and remade the food but that was it. She just kept saying \"I don't know what happened.\" Well we don't either but it's unacceptable to happen that many times. If I had two hairs in my muffin alone the least you could do is take it off. Three hairs is a little outrageous and repulsive to find in your food. All of us had our hair up in hats so it definetly wasn't our own."}
{"text":"We've been hearing about this little place for a while and decided to try it. I cook scratch at home and was looking forward to their chorizo gravy.  I ordered the ultimate chorizo chicken and waffles, looking forward to a nice, crispy piece of fried chicken. What I got was a pre-frozen, pre-breaded piece of chicken tender, sliced thinly on top of my chorizo gravy. Very disappointing! The waffle had great flavor with chorizo and green chilies cooked into it.  Unfortunately, they used canned green chilies which were tasteless and full of skins.  I go to New Mexico each year and buy green chilies to roast and freeze. It's not hard to use real green chilies... My dish was $15.95 and NOT worth that cost. My husband got the chicken fried steak which was very tender. One of his 2 over easy eggs had a broken yolk and it was covered in gravy. Yummy but disappointing. He enjoyed it so overall, the experience was good. Our waitress was very sweet but called be \"sweetie\" and \"honey\", which is nice but it bothers me personally. Very friendly people and quaint little place. We'll prob go back for lunch but it's not at the top of my list."}
{"text":"This small little breakfast place in Tempe is amazing! Mark, himself is the chef! No joke. This is a small, little find of a place that one may be lucky enough to find if you don't blink.. OR if you have yelp, of course! The staff right off from entering is nice and ready to make you happy. We were instantly greeted with waters and told that the pastries were down to two because they are supposedly THAT good! We did not embide, BUT, maybe someday! I loved that they advised us of that, though. I also loved that we instantly got water without having to ask and the coffee we did ask for was on it's way shortly thereafter.  From the menu, I would sum Mark's Cafe as being a Benedict place! There are almost a dozen types of Benedict's on the menu and a couple on the 'specials board'. I ordered the Neptune Eggs Benedict. I was pleasantly surprised, (as I always am in the desert), to get REAL crabmeat on this Benedict. Mark's ran out of crab for half of the Benedict, BUT the waitress was super sweet and offered any other Benedict on the menu for me with an apology. To be honest, I was full off the one half of the Neptunes already! Neptunes is obviously a crab benedict underneath the usual hollandaise, but they have a plain hollandaise and a spicy hollandaise. I highly recommend the spicier of the two. It's freshly made by Mark and that makes all the difference in the Benedict. The second half I got to replace what was missing from half of the Neptune was a special on that day: the French Benedict. Same type of typical Benedict but with proscuitto. Yum! It comes with a side of house potatoes too; yummy for that leftover hollandaise sauce!  My boyfriend ordered the Biscuits and Gravy. It was a HUGE plate of just that: Biscuits with sausage gravy, both freshly made. It came with a couple of eggs and bacon too. In case, all that sausage in the gravy just wasn't gonna be enough! There was a Blueberry Pancake ordered and on the table by our friend. She asked for just one from the stack order. They happily accommodated her request. That pancake was the size of the dinner, err, breakfast plate it was on. SO huge! The blueberries come on the side for you to spoon out at your delight and are syrupy and a concoction made again, by Mark the Chef , himself.  The coffee never ran empty and the staff was super nice and happy.  Mark's is a small cafe. We arrived about 1130am on a Sunday and it was almost full and I would imagine it fills up with quite a wait during the busiest times on a weekend.  I love a family run business that is local such as Mark's Cafe. I learned after our brunch there that day that Mark's does catering too. Good to know for any events in the upcoming holiday season! If he can perfect a Benedict and it's sauce, I can only imagine what he can do with holiday pies!"}
{"text":"My buddies and I were in Phoenix  last weekend for our time-honored Spring Training trip and were led here by Urbanspoon (yes, some people still use it).  It doesn't look like much from the outside, but set aside your skepticism - it's a perfect breakfast spot with perfectly reasonable prices.    We ordered from the entire breakfast gamut - eggs benedict, chorizo breakfast wrap, waffles, kielbasa/swiss/egg scramble - and found winners across the board.    Our waitress even had the good sense to warn my friend that an additional short stack order was unnecessary - one pancake would surely suffice.  She wasn't kidding - this pancake was bigger than my face and nice and fluffy.  Get the word out about this place - their FB page is \"Saving Mark's Cafe\" so I'm not sure if they're in danger of having to close down...hopefully that's not the case because it would certainly be a damn shame."}
{"text":"It's been a few weeks since our visit here the staff is very friendly ,the breakfast was. Good although I thought a bit pricey"}
{"text":"I want to like this place more than 3 stars, but unfortunately that's about where Mark's Cafe stands.  The good stuff first: the staff was SUPER nice. The place is small, but inviting. Not very stylish, but not off-putting either. The flavors of the food were pretty decent. I ordered the Irish Eggs Benedict (with Corned Beef Hash instead of Canadian Bacon). I enjoyed the taste of my meal...except the homefried potatoes; those were bland.  Now, the bad: none of our entrees were served very hot. They weren't cold enough to send back, but just merely warm. And, don't be fooled by the photos (including mine), you won't leave this place stuffed. The portions are decent, but they are by no means generous. I was satisfied after cleaning my plate...but I actually had to clean my plate to just barely get there. In my book, diner breakfasts should be big. They should have you walking out full and happy. I mean, what's one more scoop of  homefries really going to cost them? I'll tell you what one less costs them: customers.  The coffee was typical \"diner crud.\" I wouldn't bother ordering it if you actually love coffee. It's the same watery, bitter mess they serve at most old timey diners. I wish, in general, these mom & pop diners all over would step up their coffee game. This isn't the 20th century anymore; people expect a good tasting cup of joe.  Overall, Mark's Cafe is decent, but not noteworthy enough to recommend."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time this morning....excellent service and staff, along with an amazing menu!  Marc had the chorizo waffle, sounds strange, but was incredibly delicious!  I had the chorizo wrap...the portions are large-just overall a delicious, quaint lovely breakfast spot!  Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"So we decided to try something new which brought us to Marks Cafe. The food is great. If you have children this place will be perfect, their kids meal is small and simple and not to mention the kids can draw on the table with washable markers. Yes, mom and dads I am talking to you!! We can actually talk without the kids constantly bugging us since they're entertaining themselves drawing. LOL!"}
{"text":"Based on Yelp reviews we stopped by and checked this spot out. The portions were big and the food was cooked to protection. The service was spectacular or I would have given it 5 starts. Our drinks were empty half of our breakfast and it took them 10 minutes to cash us out. I would go again to try something else on the menu for sure."}
{"text":"I love the food here, but the wait service is super slow!!! Like said the food is great, but have to give it a 3 bc of the service. I especially love their omelets"}
{"text":"Not super impressed by this place. I ordered something simple. A cheese omelet, it was OK at best. Potatoes GREASY! This place gets good reviews and maybe I should have ordered one of the bene's to get a better taste for the place but I also think a simple omlete should be stellar and it was not. I may try it again but I doubt it. There are better places IMO. Service was good though and they were very nice."}
{"text":"Simple comfort food. They didn't do anything fancy with their chicken fried steak. It was exactly what it should be."}
{"text":"Not pictured: THE BEST BISCUIT I HAVE EVER HAD! The biscuits are small-ish but they come with the honey butter and you can ask for the strawberry jam that is made IN HOUSE. Get a biscuit on the side. It's the best $1 you will spend in your life.  GET THE GRILLED MUFFINS  The food is incredible and all but the service is even better! They were probably pretty understaffed and were all rushing around but they were very apologetic, engaging, and down to earth. Some people might complain about slower service but you didn't come to Denny's you came to a family owned place with charming people who don't run like robots. You get people who talk to you and care about if you enjoy your meal. They love it when you get creative or risky with what you order! I am not a chorizo stuffed waffle kind of person normally! I had many wonderful conversations and I really felt like I belonged there in an authent  Both of the waffles were delicious but they were a little thick for my taste but most people love that, it's just a preference thing.  There's another review that says nothing is local or fresh. That person is LYING! It's all fresh and a good deal of their best stuff is made here!   My husband and I will be back many more times to try EVERYTHING ELSE on the expansive menu but mostly for the sweet servers and the biscuits.    SECOND REVIEW  Biscuits are still delicious   Got a quiche Lorraine that was very good and WOW what a Benedict. New requirement: YOU MUST GET THE GRILLED MUFFINS! I don't know why someone thought they were from Costco? They may be the same shape but that's just how muffins work? They have unique flavors and are hecka delicious. Poppyseed is the best."}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to try a new breakfast place today and we found Mark's  cafe based on the reviews. It was delicious!!! The staff was very friendly. The amount of food was great as well. It was a great breakfast experience."}
{"text":"Cute little place, good food, but a little over priced. I got the southwest benny, and it was good the first few bites but after a while I couldn't handle how dry the chorizo was. It was also in a patty shape which was kind of weird and sort of reminded me of dog food... I still want to come back and try all their other eggs benedicts, though. My friend got the country benny and she loved it. Boyfriend got the raspberry French toast and he scarfed it down in like two seconds haha. So just based on my experience and my taste buds, I'm giving three stars. I'm hoping as I explore the menu, it'll change my review :)"}
{"text":"Mine and my boyfriend's favorite breakfast place in town. Amber never steers us wrong and always greets us like old friends (we're there at least twice a month). The biscuits and gravy are worth ruining your diet over (get the gravy half and half). Seriously. We always take friends here when they ask to meet up some place for breakfast.   Get there early or be patient - the place is small - because it's completely worth it."}
{"text":"This was good. We got there about 10:15am on a Saturday. There were a few tables occupied when we got there and when we left about 40 min later it was full of patrons.  I had the French Eggs Benedict with spicy hollandaise and one banana pecan pancake on the side. My husband had the Irish Eggs Benedict with spicy hollandaise. My Benedict was really good, but I liked his even better. Also the pancake was delicious and incredibly huge. I even liked the home fries, which is a side dish that usually I can take it or leave it.  The service was very good; very attentive.  There are a lot of things on the menu I would like to return to try."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast joint with courteous staff. I had the eggs benedict with salmon, cup cake trio and their macadamia nut cold coffee. I had enough to take back for a snack as well. Amongst the cup cake trio, the Apple Cinnamon flavored one was hands down the best. Blueberry and Chocolate were just average. A little pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"Without a doubt one of the best breakfasts I've ever had! A little unassuming place on the corner, the menu is a knockout!  The staff are the friendliest (Tastebud Whisperer) the food....oh the food....! I seriously can't tell you how yummy it was! Go here!"}
{"text":"Amazing!! Don't come here starving because service is kinda slow. They weren't expecting the morning rush in a holiday Friday I think. They called in help, so it got better as we dined. Food is amazing ! Pancakes bigger than your face and muffins to die for!!!"}
{"text":"The service can be a little slow, but that's because they're usually full and the kitchen is small. That's my only complaint. The food is great. They have good potatoes, the irish eggs benedict is delish!!!!!! Give em a try. The staff is very welcoming. They seem to love being there which makes it feel homey."}
{"text":"Excellent, fresh, local food.  Awesome, friendly, accommodating service.  Too bad I didn't know about this cafe sooner.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Local (family) business with chef Mark, his daughter and other family members supporting this breakfast and lunch cafe. ALERT: They are closed on Mondays and Tuesdays.  I normally stop for breakfast. The food is way better and prices comparable to other breakfast spots (such as US Egg and First Watch). If you love eggs Benedict or superb waffles this is the spot for you!  Today I ordered a lunch of pesto chicken pasta and a slice of grilled bread. The portion was large (I took over half home) and very tasty. Cost was $8.95. Service was attentive with a friendly, family feel. I love the background music here. The place is very clean.  There are 8 four top tables and 1 two top table inside and several tables outside, as well as several counter seats for service. They also offer take-out and catering. Mark's Cafe is located in an Albertson's shopping center on Rural and Guadalupe with parking right at the door."}
{"text":"This place is great! Very friendly staff/family, and the food is delish! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We arrived to standing room only!  Clearly a locals hot spot.  We walked in and was quickly greeted by Amber mike's daughter is very excited to see newbies. She really knows her guests.  I'm typically very skeptical of coffee at breakfast houses, but that I'd give it a try.  The color was a dark rich brown when putting in a little bit of cream and I thought here we go!  I got a little worried when I thought the smell smelled like a typical Folgers cup of coffee, but when I tasted it it's one of the better cups of coffee at breakfast places.  We were finally seated in a cozy corner next to the window.  Scott ordered the Spanish omelette and me having missed the Spanish omelette on the menu ordered the three cheese.  When I ordered an extra side of salsa the Spanish was brought to my attention and I ended up switching out getting that as well.    My food arrived first and it looked lovely.  There was a small of an interesting herb I couldn't quite place so I tasted the potatoes because I could see that there were some herbs on them. The potatoes were slightly undercooked and had a Provence herb mix, but not enough seasoning so I had to add additional salt and pepper."}
{"text":"Mark and the staff have a great place here. We are now new regulars. Thanks for the great service and food."}
{"text":"My husband and I are tying to eat breakfast at a local restaurant once a week, and this last weekend we decided to try out Marks. We have heard great reviews of their Hollandaise sauce & we LOVE eggs Benedict. We brought along a friend & we each ordered a different kind. (the Irish, Scottish & Southwestern) Right after they took our order Karen came out to apologize, but they were completely out of Hollandaise.... What? It wasn't even late! - we were there around 9:30 on a Sunday morning! That was the whole reason we came in, for that yummy buttery, zesty sauce! After we got over our disappointment we each ordered again. I ended up trying out their steak omelet that was on their breakfast specials.  It was pretty tasty. The omelet & steak was well seasoned and had a lot of filling inside. I hate omelette's that are more cheese than egg, but this one was just cheesy enough for me. The breakfast potatoes though were just potatoes. They were not very dry & bland. I had to smother them in hot sauce & salt. Maybe it was just because I had my taste buds set on eggs Benedict, but I was a little disappointed. I will give Marks another try & another review, hopefully they have enough Hollandaise next time."}
{"text":"Had some time before the hubby had to be at work so we went to Mark's and this time, we were able to eat there. The first time, we got it to go and I picked it up.   Small, quaint place a downhome feel to it. There are 10 tables in the restaurant. The waitress was very friendly and did a great job of keeping our drinks filled and brought things out in record time. Fast service!   I had the Biscuits & Gravy with a side of sunny-side up eggs and some bacon. Very good, very tasty, so yummy! I will definitely order that again! Next visit, it's the lunch menu we'll be trying!"}
{"text":"Worst Breakfast I've probably ever had.  I've always been skeptical of places that also cater, but this place had 'charm' from the outside. Also had some friends RAVE about the hollandaise sauce so I thought I would give it a try.  Took the kids for a late breakfast.   The service was quick and very friendly so a plus there.  The restaurant itself is small, and the only 2 clients inside were about 95 years old sitting side by side facing the rest of the restaurant. Basically you couldn't sit anywhere without their eyes being on you. Granted that's not the owners fault, but still weird.  I ordered the SW Eggs Benedict. It came with a side of \"home fries\"  The Benedict itself consisted of an old and dry biscuit, beneath what used to be a frozen puck of chorizo (now completely dry and flavorless) topped by a rather bland hollandaise.   That wasn't even the worst part...  The \"potatoes\" we're green, and mushy. Home fries are supposed to be chopped potatoes of the potato color with a delightfully crispy outside. They were clearly boiled and then maybe attempted to be pan fried?  More about green potatoes: www.nytimes.com/2007/07/03/health/nutrition/03real.html?_r=0  My daughter ordered pancakes. Pretty sure they were biscuick, though I have no proof so it may or may not be so. Either way they weren't the best, or the worst.  Lastly, the music.  They were listening to a Christian radio station. It was blatant. I couldn't handle it, I'm sure others will disagree and that's fine. Everyone has the right to their religion and to go where they please.  These are just the reasons I won't go back here with my family."}
{"text":"Small, intimate, a bit crowded, easy parking, friendly and kind waitresses, a gourmet and happy chef and a business that has existed for10+years in the same spot make for a delicious meal in a pleasant environment!  That must be Mark's Cafe.  He serves delectable breakfast and lunch food during 7A - 2P and closed on Monday and Tuesday.  It's a happy family staffed restaurant.  He makes a fabulous biscuits and gravy, 2 ways, standard white, and chorizo, an orange-tan colored delight.  You can order it one way or both ways.  The same is available on the chicken fried steak.  His hamburgers are large and cooked perfectly to order. He has a large white board with off menu specials as well and is known for his varied eggs Benedict breakfasts.  For me, I think he could make better home fried potatoes, needing more flavor and crispier texture.  A big surprise is his English muffins which are crispy and taste great, I believe they are fried in butter!  I could go on and on but it would be best if you just tried him out.  We will be back again many times."}
{"text":"After a morning appointment we needed some food!  It was getting late, so it was really \"brunch\" time.  YELP showed this place was close and highly rated.  While looking at menus and chatting with \"Amber\" we learned they have been here14 years and it is entirely a family operation.  The items in the menu are familiar, but often have a twist to them.  Like a corned-beef hash with hollanaise.  In my case I got the country fried steak, but with chorizo gravy instead of the usual white gravy. Also ordered was chicken and waffles, chorizo waffles, and French toast.  The steak was good.  The flavor without the sauce was pretty typical, but the chorizo sauce made it unique.  The potatoes had a nice seasoning, too.  Eggs also came with it, and were simple eggs.  The chicken in the chicken and waffles was cubed and somewhat crispy.  Also available with chorizo sauce.  Very tasty.  The chorizo waffles are actually stuffed with chorizo.  They put syrup on the side, but I don't think syrup really works with chorizo.  French toast was French toast.  Overall a very nice meal.  I'm hoping to come back soon and try something else!"}
{"text":"Delightful from the minute we walked in the door! Amber the 'Taste Whisperer' helped create an amazing breakfast not even listed on the menu--- and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"It's the absolutely best breakfast place in AZ and probably in the country.  I know you probably think I am being dramatic but I travel all the time, I've lived in Mpls, Houston, Dallas, Chicago, and now the Chicago burbs and no place can compete.  We lived in Tempe for a short time while there for my husband's work project and found Mark's on Yelp.  Thought let's give it a shot.  It's hands down the BEST.  It's not fancy (sometimes hard to get a  but the service and the food quality are the absolute best.   Honestly anything you order on this menu you will be pleased with.  Moving back to IL this is the number one thing I miss.   Keep it going Mark's Cafe you all are GREAT!"}
{"text":"After seeing this place on Yelp last Saturday, we thought we would try it out for a late breakfast. First impression, SMALL. Very small. Only about 10 tables crammed into a small space. A few seats at the bar and a few tables out front. This place is in a strip mall at the very end, so it's hard to see unless you drive right near it. The people are very friendly and seem genuinely happy to work there.  Mark the owner was there cooking with his son in law. His adult daughter is a waitress there, too. Other people work there but not sure if they are family. They had light Christian music playing in the background. The have markers on the table so you can draw on the glass tables while you wait. (Wipable markers). We started out with the fried muffins sampler plate. You get 3 half muffins of your choice. All were good. Took most home. I had a Greek style egg plate with hash browns and English muffin. Very good. Lots of food. The plate was about 10.00. But you get alot of good food. I forgot what my hubby ordered, but he said it was good. All in all, we enjoyed the place. Good food and good customer service. Prices were a little high for breakfast. But food was good. They need a bigger restaurant. They only have 1 restroom and you have to walk through the kitchen to get to it. The restroom is small and hot. So I give it a 4 star, just because the place is small and because of the awkward small restroom."}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD! I'm not kidding when I say great food. This is a hidden gem right in our backyard. Fantastic food and friendly staff and service. Please give them a try and promise you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"What a delightful hidden little restaurant. The food was fresh, appealing and served warm. The service was fabulous with smiling servers that made time to chit chat and double back to see you without interrupting our brunch."}
{"text":"The Mexican style wrap was prepared and displayed well and it tasted fantastic. They're gravy is delicious, coffee mediocre, but drinkable and the waitress had to be the nicest most comical person I've ever been in contact with at a restaurant. Next time I'll try the chicken and waffles, the waitress took us on a \"visual journey\" to see them and ended the conversation with, \"they taste so good make you want to slap yo mama!\""}
{"text":"There is sooo much to choose from!!!!  If you don't see what you like on the menu,  just ask Mark! He will whip it up!!!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing! The service is excellent. The spicy hollandaise sauce is fantastic!! I love the music they play"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service in a down home, welcoming spot.  Very good Eggs Benedict at a fair price.    Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Food was good, staff was friendly, Christian music was a huge turnoff.  Probably will never go back because of this."}
{"text":"We used to do our weekly sunday breakfast at Chompies.. that was until I got serious food poisoning from them and vowed never to go back. This left me and my family in quite the pickle... we love local breakfast places but hate chain restaurants. One morning while driving around to find a new breakfast spot we found Mark's... tucked away in a little corner of a strip mall. As soon as we walked in i could tell it was going to be good, the customers were so happy, and the employees were super nice. The food is simply amazing, chef Mark is a wiz in that kitchen. Everything I have ordered from here I would eat over and over again. My favorite is the hollandaise, it is the best I have ever had!! I recommend this place for anyone looking to break out of the restaurant rut."}
{"text":"One real hidden gem of Phoenix! This little restaurant shames others with outstanding flavor and variety of gourmet level cuisine at very reasonable prices. When they say you can get your dish prepared ANY way you like, they mean it!  Best Eggs Benedict (ALL SEVEN) in the Sun Valley! And the ONLY place to find REAL Mulligantawny Soup! Make sure you check this amazing treasure."}
{"text":"Love this tiny little cafe. Small but mighty, good is fantastic. Service is great. They're specialty is eggs Benedict, housemade hollandaise.  Also Housemade chorizo."}
{"text":"Very nice little spot! The menu is huge, and they will usually cater to whatever you ask for if you want something different! The head waitress is always there, I forget her name, but she's very nice and helpful. The food is very tasty, though I've only ever had breakfast... the only reason I give it 4 instead of  5 stars is because they use a very strong cleaning solution on all the tables, and are constantly spraying and wiping them down, which leaves an awful hospital-like aroma in the air. On one occasion, the smell was so bad that I couldn't finish my food. Mark's staff, if you read this, don't use so much cleaning solution while people are eating, or switch to something that isn't nearly as strong!"}
{"text":"By far the absolute BEST Benedict in the valley.  This little mom and pop joint is definitely worth the stop by the food is delicious,  the staff is all family and so friendly, you will not regret this meal decision!"}
{"text":"I ordered the omelette with Mushrooms, peppers, tomatoes, onions, broccoli, topped w melted cheese & some herb stuff?? I asked for egg whites but they gave regular eggs because they forgot but that's okay. Friendly staff, nice little mom&pop restaurant actually run by a father & his daughter I believe."}
{"text":"Gotta say I've tried coming here twice and both times walked and had to walk back out. Cleanliness of the restaurant and wait staff on both visits was pretty sketchy. Which is why I never made it go the food, which given the eyeball test I wouldn't eat anyway."}
{"text":"Was running errands and was hungry for breakfast so I  opened up yelp and swung in. Took my boyfriend and we both ordered coffee. It's was very good coffee! Strong flavorful not over brewed and fresh.   I couldn't decided what I wanted so Mark's daughter offered to split two meals to make one for me. I got the biscuits and gravy one biscuit with each gravy.  The chorizo sausage gravy is hands down the best! I don't even like chorizo.   I also got a traditional eggs benny. The hollandaise sauce was PERFECT! The egg was perfect and the ham was thick and delicious.   The boyfriend got the chicken and waffles with chorizo sausage gravy. The chicken was tender and flavorful. The waffle could have been more crispy.   Over all very good. Great service. Fun place. Recommend it."}
{"text":"Service here was great. Everyone was very friendly and welcoming. I came here on a Sunday morning a little before 9am. We waited about 5 minutes and got seated.  Chicken and waffles: You can pick between white gravy or chipotle. It was my first time trying it so our server suggested I do half and half. I definitely liked the white gravy more. The chipotle was a little weird with the waffle. The waffle was very thick! It was delicious but kind of heavy.  Nutella Strawberry Belgian Waffle (daily special item): Yummy! It was as expected - thick belgian waffle, fresh strawberries, delicious nutella."}
{"text":"I've never written a yelp review until now specifically because I had such a great experience at marks! I live in San Diego and went while visiting for Christmas. The food was so delicious, i got biscuits and gravy and a country fried steak- so good. Not to mention, the service was awesome! everyone was so unbelievably nice and our waitress was cracking us up the whole time. Thanks so much for the experience guys, you da bomb."}
{"text":"You know how you crave something absolutely disgustingly greasy when you are hungover sometimes? Don't ask me why biscuits and gravy became a hot topic of conversation waking up in bed but it led us to Mark's Cafe.  The place is a tiny family owned restaurant and everyone was very sweet and the service was decent.  As for the food, we ordered Chicken Fried Steak and it was \"okay\" but nothing special. The potatoes had a rubbery texture like they had been previously frozen. Coffee is standard diner coffee and my poached eggs were cooked perfectly and served in a side dish.  All that I can say is that the staff was very friendly and sweet. Otherwise, you're better off making your own breakfast at home."}
{"text":"The biscuits and gravy were the best, we also tried the chorizo burrito which was full of flavor"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dining experience here yesterday when we decided to stop in for breakfast. We parked our keesters on a patio table and were promptly greeted. Apparently mark's cafe has been in business for 20 years,  and it seemed like a family run type of place.  The service was funny and friendly.  Our food was so delicious, and we can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, even though it was super busy & only 1 supergal to do everything in front!  All our food was delicious!  She gave spot on recommendations!!  Will definitely be back again next year"}
{"text":"We came on a busy morning and right after we were served, our boys spilled orange juice and water all over the table! They were so nice about it and super accommodating! Food was good and portions big too! You can definitely feel that it's a family owned and run restaurant- our kinda place! We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"OK Mark's Cafe. Color me impressed!   Met the girlfriends here Saturday morning for breakfast. I saw the great reviews but wasn't really sure what to expect. I was grateful there was an open table at 8:30am and they were quick with the coffee - cause I needed it. When it came time to order, my friend Sal could not decide between two items. She asked our server, Amber, her preference between the two. Sal wasn't ok with the answer Amber provided, for Sal was really craving that hollandaise sauce! Amber sensed this, asked a couple of questions about Sal's preferences and then said \"how about I bring you the chorizo hash on an open biscuit and one covered in hollandaise and the other in country gravy.\" SOLD! Then Amber swiftly turned around so we could spot her nickname on the back of her shirt - \"Taste Bud Whisperer\".   Everyone enjoyed what they ordered and it was all quite filling. I can't comment on the prices for Sal wouldn't let us see the bill. But I can tell you the atmosphere was relaxed and family friendly, the service was prompt and personal, and the food was yummy. I wish I lived closer to this place."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I have gone here multiple times and the service is on point with great breakfast food as well. The restaurant itself is not the biggest but I have never had to wait more than a few minutes to get a table. The service is fast, the menu is a standard American breakfast menu with some house specialties added as well. I typically get an omelet and add pancakes on the side which are great!   I think the service is what makes this restaurant awesome as well. The servers are always happy with a welcoming attitude. It shows they truly take pride in the restaurant and enjoy working there. It puts me in a good mood and I leave full with a smile so that goes a long way!!! I cannot wait to visit Arizona and dine here again!"}
{"text":"Oh man this place is yummy! I had the Irish Eggs Benedict. There was so much I couldn't even finish it all. Nice family run business in a shopping center that has a diner feel to it. Very friendly staff. Will be back for sure when I come to visit from Los Angeles!"}
{"text":"What a great little cafe!  My son had an omelet that he said was the best and I had some oatmeal loaded with fresh fruit. We had a side of the best bacon and the home fried were so flavorful. But even better was the friendly atmosphere and terrific service. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent, service was great as well. Listen to the taste bud whisperer's recommendations and you won't be let down."}
{"text":"I guess I can hold a grudge and be a little bitter, the last experience left me sad when I went to Mark's Café, but after a long long long long time, it was time to give them a try.  I had still been hearing that Mark's is the best spot for eggs benedicts, and those are still my favorite, so I wondered on over to Mark's around 11ish on a Saturday morning, and let me tell you my hopes of having any eggs benedicts where slim to none since it was almost noon.  The place was packed, so grabbed a seat a bar, again service was friendly and fast.  I asked if they had run out of hollandaise sauce, and guess what, they had not!!! Oh today my was day!!  I didn't even need to look at the menu I knew what I wanted, I ordered the Irish Eggs Benedicts. It was 2 English muffins topped with corn beef hash and 2 poached eggs and covered in fresh hollandaise sauce. This was an excellent tasting eggs bennys, the hollandaise sauce was creamy, bright yellow, a little tangy and buttery smooth! Everything I had hoped it to be! Soo good! This was a delish breakfast for sure!   I am so sorry I waited forever to give Mark's another try, but you better believe I will be coming around more often!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been searching for the best Eggs Benedict in the valley when we found this little place of pure delight. If you ever wanted to travel the World and taste Bennies, save your money because the best from around the globe are right here! They have seven amazing variations on the menu, including, of course, the Traditional which will be the best you have ever had! The combination of fresh ingredients and their homemade Hollandaise Sauce, is just to die for! Don't think that they stop at seven Bennies, no, always ask if they have a special! For example, the French Benedict is out of this World!"}
{"text":"The muffins are incredible!!! I recommend the chicken and waffles with the chorizo gravy. In my mind it doesn't work, but my mouth was saying yes it does."}
{"text":"This place is not bad at all. I wouldn't say i am a fan quite yet because I did not get to finish all my food, but one of these days when I'm in the mood I will give it another go.     My manager said her burger was good as far as the toppings but the burger itself was bland and needed flavor even just salt and pepper can go a long way.    I had ordered a country style frittata that was good but was missing something just couldnt put my finger on it, I added my side potatoes to make it a little more flavorful and loved the two together.    One of these days you will get another chance. Some day."}
{"text":"This quaint, little eatery is within walking distance to my home, so needless to say, it has become a spot that I don't mind frequenting some weekends, especially when the tummy is rumbling.  Just because it's nearby, the food obviously has to hold its own in order to have me continually coming back for more, and I can proudly say that Mark's Cafe has hit all the right notes with me, as well as my belly!  The staff always gives you a warm welcome as you enter the establishment, and continue to show that same respect and appreciation to all of their customers throughout your experience at Mark's.  Anything in the way of food that I've ever had there has been top notch as well.  That being said, this restaurant is absolutely worthy of the five star review I am giving it.  Hats off to you, Mark's Cafe, keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"They're super friendly and said I could make anything on the menu, so I substituted hollandaise for gravy, both the same cost as a side, and up charged me. At first I was a little confused but they gave pretty decent portions of the sauce so the extra $2 wasn't a biggie I suppose.  Apple streusel grilled muffin with real butter was insane & given a complimentary taste of the raspberry butter (I'm still a pure butter guy). So nice of them!  The chicken and waffles were delicious, I love how the chicken was a thin well breaded breast piece that was cut into the perfect slices. Served with real butter and a gooey syrup.  The staff there is just amazing, I cannot believe how friendly they were. Even as I was leaving the kitchen staff said goodbye all the way from the kitchen!  I'll be recommending people to support this great lil business!"}
{"text":"Hands down best experiences here. Been many times and will always recommend friends and family to go. Still have never ordered on my own, due to the taste bud whisper there who always orders the best meal for me depending on what I'm feeling like that day. Everything that comes out of the kitchen is delectable and if you leave hungry, it's your own fault. LOVE Mark's Cafe!!!"}
{"text":"Wow!!! This little place is amazing! And of course Amber is amazing. Quick note, her menu choices are on point!  This is a must try if you like little hole in the wall places.  Its small and cozy and there is nothing real fancy about it. However, if you want great made to order food and service that is awesome, then you need to make a visit."}
{"text":"Went two days in a row. Once for breakfast then lunch. Service was great the first day a little slower the second but not horrible very nice people. Breakfast was absolutely amazing, could not stop stuffing our faces. Boyfriend had the ultimate Benedict and I had the banana pecan pancakes and shared the apple crumble muffin. Lunch the next day boyfriend had the chicken Alfredo he couldn't stop eating it. I had the chicken salad croissant. Only sad part was it was a little bland but wasn't bad once I added salt and pepper. I highly recommend it and we will be going back again soon. Would give it 5 stars but because of the slower service and the sandwich gave it a 4."}
{"text":"Actually I would say 4.5 stars. I ate here on a Thursday morning around 8:30. As expected, not a lot of business at that time.   I received impeccable service from the lone server Sara(h). Very attentive. The food was perfectly and quickly prepared. It was also very tasty. I had my choice of hot sauces and the coffee was very good.   I ordered the Irish Benedict and this is why 4 stars instead of 5. The cook uses canned corned beef hash. I'm not saying it's terrible but the breakfast would have been amazing if it had fresh corned beef.   As an Irishman I cannot give canned corned beef 5 stars. That being said, I will be back to try something new."}
{"text":"Wow! I am blown away by how good Mark's Cafe is. I've finally found a breakfast spot I would wake up early to get to. The grilled caramel apple muffin is out of this world. By the way, the chorizo gravy really IS amazing. You have to give this place a try. Service is great in this yummy little breakfast nook."}
{"text":"It's the little things that can decide whether you like a place or not, and want to come back.  After seeing this place on Yelp, I stopped by, ordered the Spaniard Omelette. It was good.  The toast was good.  The potato's were definitely not good, I did not like the taste at all.  The owners had their young kids helping out... as a proud father of 3 kids, I am kid friendly.  However, the kids were being kids, not something I really was looking forward to at 7:30a or 8a in the morning, especially within the confines of a small space, and plus, they charged my credit card with someone else's bill.    Due to the potato's, the kids, and/or the incorrect charge, will check out other places in the area during my visit here."}
{"text":"The grilled muffins are amazing! The staff is super kind as it's a family run business! The portions are huge and the food is always good! A great little hole in the wall!"}
{"text":"Mark's catered an event for us  Their food was great and the service they provided us was impeccable. We will use them again with pleasure."}
{"text":"Usually the wait time here is 10-15 minutes since it is a small place. We got lucky and got to sit at the counter and beat the wait. We ordered a cup of regular coffee and one iced coffee to get us started. The iced coffee with a splash of vanilla added was fantastic. The chicken and waffles, as well as the eggs benedict tasted great. I had mine with a side of scrambled eggs and American cheese on top. I tried the chicken and waffles first without the syrup and it can definitely stand on its own. The syrup makes it taste even better and wasn't too sweet and overpowering.   This place is family owned and the staff are very friendly and attentive. There is a little sign on the wall that says \"All I need is a cup of coffee and Jesus.\" I definitely think Jesus will be making his return so that he can have the chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"I love this place! Excellent breakfast food with a nice twist. I haven't had anything I wasn't super impressed with here. Additionally the staff are amazing, from the waitresses to the cooks. Everyone is extremely friendly and really cares about how much you love your food.  Go here if you want a home style experience with lots of love!!   5 star food and 10 star service"}
{"text":"Mark's was fantastic! We found the restaurant through Yelp and live just down the street. We love local spots and we will definitely be back. The service was phenomenal and everyone was so genuine and nice. Food was fantastic and there is a great selection to chose from! We love our leftovers too! Thank you Mark's!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast this morning seats were available at the counter we had coffee and were given water when we sat down very busy little place. I had the protein plate 3 eggs cooked perfectly ham,sausage ,and bacon very good also had biscuit and gravy also very good. Wife had the chicken fried steak and gravy she said hers was good as well. Even tho it was a busy Saturday morning they were able to seat most within 15-20 min."}
{"text":"Let me start.  This is not my first time here. Their standard menu is very good along with numerous daily specials to complement. Some of the must try's are the California Eggs Benedict. If you like a little kick request the spicy hollandaise, Awesome. They make everything from scratch including a made to order chorizo sausage gravy!!!  You may want to try a muffin trio as a starter. The bake them on premises and then grill them to give them a nice crunch with flavored butters. The place only holds about 45 people so on weekends get their early. The waitstaff is very good and helpful.   They are located in the corner of a strip mall in the Albertson's grocery center.  Try it and you'll be a regular.  Back again on another trip. Did the Cali eggs Benedict again. You just can't go wrong with excellence!  Thanks Mark!"}
{"text":"So delicious! And customer service was amazing! We're on vacation in from Ca and this place came across yelp so we decided to try it! Everyone was so happy with their food, I had Country Frittata with biscuit gravy Sauce and a side of their famous chorizo gravy sauce, their grilled muffins with raspberry butter OMG delish!!!"}
{"text":"I was in the mood to give my $$$$ and support a local establishment so I found Mark's here at Yelp. I went very early one morning and was the only person there. After looking at the menu since this was my first time I played it safe and ordered the pancakes.  The pancakes were HUGE. In fact, they covered the entire plate (see picture). The eggs were good and the bacon was extra crispy.   The pancakes didn't have a taste or flavor at all. It was like eating typing paper with syrup. The eggs were really good and the bacon wasn't bad.  All and all I think I'll go back again, but I won't order the pancakes. I'll probably try something else. In looking at the other pictures here I'll probably do an omelet or something,   I believe in local businesses and think they deserve another chance."}
{"text":"Never again. I knew I should have walked out when. A Chorizo burrito is called a \"Chorizo Wrap\"."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place based on the great reviews! Everyone was right! All of the workers are so kind and personable from the time you walk in till the time you leave. It's a hole in the wall place but still very popular. Food was fantastic. I had the unruly omelet...the potatoes were tasty and they even offered me homemade strawberry jam for my English muffin (highly recommend). Will definitely be coming here again!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been here, and it won't be the last. I got the Cajun Chicken last time, and I had to get it again this time. I also got the grilled cheese with bacon which will not help my weight loss, but will help my appetite. I love small businesses, they are the closest to home made than anything else out there. Get better Mark!!"}
{"text":"This place is a keeper.   Family owned, family run with a great menu and a some impressive attention to detail in the kitchen.  Just the basic \"Three Egg Scramble - w/ham, onions & bell peppers \" is awesome and comes out of the kitchen piping hot every time.  Their toasted muffins are to die for and I heard them say they make ~300 ever weekend!  It's a bit of a hole in the wall, and when busy you may have to wait for a table or seat.  They have a breakfast bar that is usually free.  I can't bring myself to dock them a star for being too busy as that is just a byproduct of how good they are.  On the rotation!"}
{"text":"WHAT A GEM! On a road trip from Orange County to Tucson, we stumbled across Marks Cafe (shout out to other yelpers for their great reviews of this place). Amber is truly (as the back of her shirt says) The Tastebud Whisperer. Warm, friendly, and knew the menu backwards and forwards, she deftly guided our choices like a sommelier at a fine dining establishment. The feta vegetable frittata was superb, my California Eggs Benedict was lighter than air and tingled my taste buds. Also, do yourself a favor and try their pesto mayonnaise, it is truly to die for. We will definitely make this place a stop on all our future road trips to the wildcat state. Thanks Amber!"}
{"text":"Not only was the food amazing but the staff really shined!! I am one of those people who gets reaaaallly indecisive and can end up just getting the same thing over and over every time. Luckily Amber, the taste bud whisperer, came over, asked me some questions, and was able to make a recommendation that I never would have thought of trying- chicken and waffles smothered in gravy and chorizo sauce. And it was AMAZING! She did the same for my fiancee and every table around us. I feel like every restaurant needs a taste bud whisperer for indecisive people like me! I am so happy that we got to try this place and look forward to bringing more people!! The service was fast, cheerful, and well organized, even on a crazy Saturday lunch rush. Definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"Came here on a whim on a Sunday morning. Only waited about 10 minutes for a table. Service was great. I had the Irish eggs Benedict. It was fantastic. The corned beef hash was just the right amount of salty, and the spicy hollandaise went well with it. Poached eggs had a perfect runny yolk and cooked white. The menu is huge, and I'm sure I could go about 20 more times and find something new I'd like to try."}
{"text":"If you're searching for a breakfast or lunch spot for right now, drop what you're doing and get here before 2 pm! They close at two and are also closed Monday and Tuesday.   I love a twist on eggs Benedict, you may have seen that if you read some of my other reviews. Today I tried the southwestern Benedict, made with spicy hollandaise, chorizo and topped on a delicious biscuit. Super yummy! Also wanted to try a pancake so I ordered one cake with their banana and pecan deliciousness in the side. Also amazing! The pancakes are giant, you have been warned. The potatoes that come in the side are also amazing. Super flavorful! I also tried the boyfriends frittata that was covered in gravy and it was definitely the best gravy I have had in a restaurant.  Super friendly service. Mark is in the kitchen singing up a storm and his daughter, granddaughter and son in law are providing some dang good customer service. So excited to have found a local, family run place in the area. One thing I have noticed since my move to the Phoenix area two weeks ago, there are a ton of chains/franchises.  I cannot wait to go back and try their grilled muffin and more Benedict twists!"}
{"text":"A must to go too!  A family restaurant and such sweet personalities!.  Try and eat three of their pancakes!  Allow Amber to pick a breakfast out for you....such fun there!  $$  All the staff is precious.  Portion sizes are large.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Love the family atmosphere and breakfast menu. Should  one not find something on the menu, Mark seriously will cook anything you want. I find the prices great for the serving sizes and quality.   Also you can describe what you like and the wait staff will give great recommendations. I also like that they ask if you want bacon crispy or soft and how well done one wants their eggs. Total customization to ones tastes."}
{"text":"Recommended to me by my dad, so we went there together this morning. I got the California Eggs Benedict which is the usual Benedict but with cooked spinach, avocado and tomato. I replaced the tomato with Canadian bacon. It also came with a small side of home fries (cubed pan-fried potatoes).The Hollandaise sauce was thinner than I'm used to and had pepper instead of paprika but it was really good. The eggs were poached perfectly and the English muffin was toasted and very good. The fries were a little underdone for my tastes (not undercooked but not browned like I like) and were also seasoned with just salt and pepper - but they were pretty good.  Overall, a very tasty breakfast. I think the plate with the added ham and a large glass of orange juice was under $15, so not bad for the quality and if you really love a great poached egg. They also have t-shirts with cool designs and the inside is very small but clean with super friendly, fast service.  Only 4 stars because while it was good, it wasn't amazing. Thicken up the sauce, brown the potatoes and add a few more spices for that coveted 5th star. Still, check it out when in the area!"}
{"text":"Run...do not walk to Mark's!! The people,as much as the food,make this place. A true gem that breaks the rules and invites it's guests to do the same!! I mean,when was the last time your server encouraged you to go off menu and create your own crazy dish!?Which i did btw and everything was perfection all the way down to the 'medium' poached eggs (yes i was actually asked how i would like my eggs poached,light,medium or hard). I could go on & on from the incredible muffin,to the coffee & selection of hot sauces...just go and experience for yourself...now!! Mark you and yours are a real inspiration.....see you for breakfast tomorrow."}
{"text":"Consider this 3.5 stars. I stopped into Mark's Café with some friends on a Saturday morning. We got there pretty early so there were plenty of tables open. It was full when we left so it can get busy apparently.   For a small place their menu is pretty big. Lots of variety on the usual breakfast fare - benedicts, omelets, pancakes, waffles - you get the idea.  Two of us went for egg dishes and two opted for pancakes. I was on the egg side, keeping it simple with scrambled eggs, bacon, and potatoes. I'm usually more of a hashbrowns kinda girl but these potatoes were really delicious. The combo of everything was great and I had no problem cleaning my plate.   The people who chose pancakes were singing a different tune however. These pancakes were ginormous. Not only were they beyond \"plate size\" they were about an inch thick. WAY too thick for my taste and both of them barely put a dent into those things. I know some people love crazy big portions but I think they could stand to scale it back a little.  Overall it was a good breakfast, the staff was friendly and I would go back."}
{"text":"Love finding a good family owned place.  First time here this morning and it was quick, delicious, and everyone was really friendly.  Ordered a short stack of pancakes and was presented with 2 of the biggest pancakes I've ever seen, couldn't even finish one!  Amber gave me a recipe for making desert with the leftovers so I'm guessing it's a common occurrence to not be able to finish them, lol.  My husband got the Chicken Fried Steak, and it was good, flavorful gravy and the Potatoes are AMAZING!  Will come back and want to try lunch here sometime too!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for breakfast on a Sunday morning. It was a cool, partly sunny morning, so I decided on the patio seating. Our waitress Amber was out right away to greet us, but gave us ample time to look over the menus. I decided on two fried eggs, country potatoes, and since they didn't have gluten free bread, I chose a small side of cottage cheese, and crispy bacon. Our food came out, very quickly. I was impressed on the speed of the service. My eggs were cooked perfectly, the potatoes we very good, and the bacon was crispy, just the way I like it. I liked that they put chives on the cottage cheese, a refreshing taste. Our waitress was very personable, and always made sure we were taken care of. FYI: they make their own ketchup, strawberry jam, and have 60 different kinds of hot sauce! I  will be back, and can't wait to try lunch items!"}
{"text":"While the food is delicious the true reason we return is the family feel.  A wonderful mom and pop place run by some of the nicest people you will have the pleasure of meeting.  Also a lesser known talent of Chef Mark are his dinners.  He came and cooked an anniversary dinner for my wife and I in our home.  His steak was so tender and flavorful!  Stop by and listen for Mark singing while cooking in the kitchen!"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place, let's start with the service. You can tell this cafe is family owned by the hospitality. Both my waitresses were extremely friendly, I can honestly say I'm not sure if I've ever gotten service like this anywhere else. I ordered the chorizo hash Benedict and our waitress asked me if I liked gravy and suggested me do one with their spicy gravy and both on biscuits, it was amazing. Will definitely be coming back and bringing my family when they come and visit."}
{"text":"Two words: Eggs Benedict.  'Nuff said."}
{"text":"Mark is a classically-trained Master Chef who trained in the same class as Emeril.  You will not believe what he does at his menu's price point.  Tiny little café with 9 tables--if you blink, you'll miss it.  Family-run establishment with great, friendly service and DELICIOUS home-made goodies.  Their muffins will make you cry with pleasure.  Waffles are awesome, particularly when part of their fried chicken with sausage gravy plate.  Their extensive selection of Eggs Benedict may be the best we've ever had.  Lots of East Coast/New England delicious fare.  Truly a pleasure to dine here--a well-priced gem with incredible food prepared by a Master Chef.  You will really enjoy yourself!"}
{"text":"This place is to Tempe what Matts Big Breakfast is to downtown but with a larger heart and a truly family owned atmosphere. It's small. There can be a wait. However, that is because EVERY plate is made to order. It's worth it! Trust me. I'm a chef and I hate breakfast. Breakfast to lunch, you will not be disappointed with the execution of your food. I STRONGLY recommend getting one of their seasonal muffins. To die for! I usually get a half of all three. Pumpkin, chocolate and blueberry. Not to mention Amber! The \"food whisperer\". She can take a glance at you, ask a few food reference questions and BOOM! She has your order. Remarkable wait staff and food. Hands down the best place to feel at home."}
{"text":"Came here this morning and sat at the bar, and the only thing I'm disappointed in is how long it took me to come here.   I love the fact that this is a family run joint and the people that work there (including the family) are extremely kind, friendly, and funny. They are accommodating and know how to make you feel welcomed. They also play Christian music which makes me happy as well! I have never been to a restaurant that does that so I was pleasantly surprised (one of the many reasons why I'll be coming back).   I believe my server was Amber, she is the wife of one of the chefs. I asked her if I should get the California eggs Benedict or the country fried steak because I couldn't decide. The \"taste bud whisperer\" aka Amber recommended a side of the country fried steak and a half order of the Cali Benedict and I am grateful she did because I got to eat both items I wanted!   I'm a HUGE fan of country fried steak and I was blown away this morning. It was breaded perfectly and I couldn't believe how tender it was. The white gravy was fantastic and seasoned perfectly.   The Cali Benedict was also very good and next time I'm going to add bacon to it. The potatoes were also yummy, but I would prefer if they were crispier. Lastly, I ended up ordering a side of bacon because.. I had to! I was so impressed with the place I couldn't help myself.   I cannot wait to come here again!!"}
{"text":"Loved the breakfast, we went later in the day, so there were not huge crowds. The service was great, they took their time to talk to us and give us suggestions on what to eat. The omelets were fantastic and we got one of the chocolate muffins, that was excellent, it was warm and we added their home made butter, worth trying."}
{"text":"Please decide on being either a business that attracts a foodie following or one that competes with Denny's. Doing both doesn't work and stretches too thin the obvious talent in the kitchen. The environment makes it difficult to enjoy the food. The menu has terrific bone structure, but the chef's true talents seem lost behind a curtain of traditional diner fare for the masses. An edit down to a smaller menu of showcase items would allow for each plate to get the attention it deserves. Somewhat of a diner feel but quite compact & loud with mostly all 4top tables & chairs- no booths & cramped counter seating for only 4. Tasty breakfast dishes at reasonable prices true, but not necessary. Where is the outreach to farmers to highlight quality ingredients? Service is friendly but this is a space where too little room exists for servers to comfortably maneuver without bumping guests. Having both a nearby cook's line of hot grill equipment and a sub-par HVAC in general, the space overheats rapidly. The constant inflow of additional outdoor air flowing in from the always-open front door compounds the issue since the SRO scene lends itself to people hovering over dining guests and not knowing if waiting inside is any better or cooler than outside.  The breakfast scramblers are truly sometimes more like a mush than a scramble whereby the egg part is almost indistinguishable from the add-ins. The side of diced potatoes need to be more cooked. And the Neptune Benedict has a good flavor profile but would be definitely over the top had a bit more restraint in the portion of crab been coupled with a higher quality lump crab. The English muffin too was good but slightly under toasted and therefore soggy. The grilled muffin is yummy, but where health and healthy foods go hand in glove this food concept seems dated and more in keeping with festival booth fare than that from a chef with great skills."}
{"text":"The best breakfast in Arizona, no question. Family ran business. Literally, Marks daughter is the server, her husband is the cook, and his younger daughter is the hostess. Amazing service. Never disappointed. You can walk in, ask the server to bring you something good and I can almost guarantee you will be amazed. That place you must take your family and friends when they come to town. If they ask you if you want chorizo gravy... Trust me, you do."}
{"text":"Great food and service with a smile! I rarely miss stopping at this place on my way through town because I can pick pretty much anything on the menu and not be disappointed! The service is also fantastic: several of the staff have been here for years and you can tell they care about the quality of their product and and taking care of their customers!"}
{"text":"I've been to Mark's a couple times but, after my last experience, I don't think I'll be back.  They don't stock fresh juices, the wait staff says, because they don't have the space.  I get that, but still missed juice with my breakfast.  I ordered pancakes and got one huge one, which wasn't a big deal.  Unfortunately, though, it was also dense and chewy and I didn't like it enough to finish even half of it.  There are lots of pros to this place - they'll save you a place in line if you call ahead, the wait staff are friendly and know the menu well.  Maybe try it and avoid the pancakes?"}
{"text":"Found this gem on Yelp after our usual spot was unavailable. We are so glad we did! Forget the usual old spot-- this is now were it's at! From Mark's family who treats you like you're family, to the most amazing breakfast you'll ever eat! Don't walk--- run to Mark's for breakfast now!!"}
{"text":"We literally just had breakfast here and we are 100% satisfied!   Service was perfect the two gals that took turns serving us were really nice and quick, they were on top of refills and condiments with a beautiful smile on their faces.  Food definitely hit the spot. We had the chicken and waffles, country fried steak, and blueberry pancakes. It was so good I couldn't stop eating even when I was full. My stomach said stop but my taste buds and my heart said keep going.  Overall we really enjoyed our morning and it was thanks to our experience here. We also thought it was cute that Mark was in the back personally cooking the food (we're guessing it was Mark cause he looked exactly like the guy on the picture). I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a good morning with good food."}
{"text":"Still the best Hollandaise I've ever tasted, but the last few visits to Mark's were frustrating for their inconsistency. Hard English muffins one time, a poached egg with the yolk cooked solid on another, and--gasp--a chunk of eggshell under my egg on a third. Any one of these could happen to any chef now and again, but the pattern of at least one mistake like this per visit has me wondering if the kitchen hasn't gotten too busy for Mark to manage everything all alone. While we visited just about every other weekend for a while, Mark's has slipped to once every 4-6 weeks on our breakfast rotation."}
{"text":"Mark's Cafe, overall, is good but it's not great.  The wait wasn't so bad, hospitality is positive, service is okay, food is good, water seems like unfiltered tap, and table cleanliness was questionable. I like the location.  Parking isn't such a challenge, atmosphere is simple, dining area wasn't overly crowded. Staff greeted us very positively and made us feel welcome. We waited for a table to be cleaned once a party left and were then allowed seat ourself. Menu has a promising selection but seems a tad overpriced.  I didn't realize the going rate was $2.45 for a fountain soda.  I'll stick with water. Had to wait for server to take our order, and it was a bit of a wait for our food to make it to our table as well.  Wait would have been less of an issue IF our food had all come out together.   The potatoes had a bit too much herbs and spices for our morning palate I guess.  They entree itself was tasty.  It's Sunday, first I heard Christmas music but then the Christmas music seemed to transition into Christian music. Christian music I guess is not a problem on a Sunday but I guess this occurs every day of the week there. Overall it was okay but the reviews lead me to believe it was much more. May go back but no huge draw."}
{"text":"So being very hungry me and my friend Sally set off for a grand adventure to find a breakfast place. As always we go right to Yelp and see what places have good reviews. We decided to come to Mark's Cafe since it was near by had good reviews.   When we first got there it was packed, so we thought that was a good sign. It was a nice day outside so we sat outside in the front. We waited a little long for service, but the waitress was really nice and explained it was just a weird day and we don't normally have to wait that long.   I ordered the Country Frittata with Potatoes and an English Muffin. I would say get the sauce on the side. My friend got the California Eggs Benedict with potatoes. We also shared one banana and pecan pancake, that was so good!!   We had water and hot chocolates as well. The hot chocolate was the perfect temperature. The only thing was when you got to the end of the drink it was very sweet and had thick chocolate at the bottom.   Great service and friendly establishment. Family own and makes you feel welcomed!!"}
{"text":"Out here for Kajikawa Classic and found Mark's Cafe on Yelp. Fantastic food and even better people. Their enthusiasm is infectious! Will be sure to eat here again whenever we're in AZ."}
{"text":"Prologue: My girlfriend and I were discussing where to go for brunch on a lazy Sunday when she suggested IHOP but also asked me to suggest something new as an alternative.  As usual, I turned to my fellow Yelpers for advice and we settled on trying this restaurant for the first time.  The Plot: We started by sharing a Pumpkin Streusel muffin followed by an Unruly Omelet  (substituting the bacon with ham) and Chicken & Waffles w/ Sausage Gravy and Chorizo Gravy.  The Scene: The portion sizes were very good and more than enough for the two of us.   The star of the meal was the Pumpkin Streusel muffin, which was served split and toasted with plain butter and raspberry butter. The muffin was light, crumbly with a nice pumpkin flavor, which was not too spicy or sugary and that went well with the raspberry butter.  My girlfriend thoroughly enjoyed the omelet, which was loaded with plenty of the meats, veggies, cheese, and was served with home fries that were prepared  and seasoned just right and were very satisfying.  The chicken that was served with the waffle was moist, juicy, and tender with a breading that had a nice, light crunch and enhanced the flavor of the chicken quite well. Both the sausage gravy and the chorizo gravy were very tasty, had the perfect consistency, and were properly seasoned.   The Rest of the Story: The waitress told us before we ordered that they loved a challenge and welcomed special requests.  So my girlfriend requested to substitute a Pumkin Streusel muffin for the English Muffin that came with her omelet (with a up charge if necessary, which would have been fine with us). This didn't seem like much of a challenge, however the waitress said she couldn't do it and that we could substitute toast for the English Muffin or something like that.  So, we ordered the Pumpkin Streusel muffin as a side and didn't eat the English Muffin.  My girlfriend also mentioned that the eggs in her omelet were a little dry as was the chicken. It also seemed liked the veggies were frozen rather than fresh, as was probably also true for the chicken, and the ham was sliced.  The Belgian waffle that was served with the chicken and gravy was light and fluffy, but tasted more like a bread roll than a waffle. It's not like it didn't work, but my taste buds were expecting a traditional Belgian waffle and so what I got just didn't compute for some reason. The chicken was good but did look like a uniformly sized and breaded frozen chicken cutlet. Considering the consistency of the waffle my guess is that it also has not been cooked to order.  We had to ask three times for refills of coffee and creamer. My suggestion is that they take a tip from IHOP and leave a carafe of coffee and a bowl of single-serve creamers at the table.  The result of all this was that we felt our four-story review had to be lowered to three stars.  Epilogue: The service was prompt and courteous. The bill for the two of us with tip came to $40, which is a little pricy when you consider how many of the ingredients apparently came out of the freezer. We'll possibly give this place at least one more try at some point and see if we can upgrade our rating to four stars.  Photo design by Billie Z."}
{"text":"The prices aren't really that bad taking into account how big the servings are. The pancakes were huge and fluffy so you can certainly split a meal. Kinda reminded me of Luke's diner from Gilmore girls just a lot smaller.  Looked family owned and the customer service was great! The food didn't take long and everyone was so friendly!"}
{"text":"Sooo good! Service was top notch. The muffins, pancakes, and omelets all live up to the hype. Neither my fiancé nor I were feeling eggs benedict this morning so we will have to come back again to try that out!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! If you haven't tried it you should! BYOB bring the champagne for mimosas!!"}
{"text":"This place rules, I'm really bummed I didn't think about getting up early enough to make it this morning! But everything is super good, muffins, pancakes, waffles, and the egg benedicts are really good also! Service is great, food is awesome, portions are a good size. If you like being full, having awesome servers who don't look bummed to be at work, and having delicious food, go here!"}
{"text":"This Place is Fantastic! !Service is Amazing! And The Food is Omg! I'm at a loss for words! everything from the muffins to specialty Eggs Benedict and French toast is so good it's a religious experience!! Amber is so kind and personable!! Love it!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast spot in Tempe. My boyfriend and I usually go every weekend and most of the meals I have gotten for breakfast or brunch has ended up being a favorite of that item. For example, their muffins are AMAZING! grilled and so soft and warm. Definitely the best muffins I've ever had. The service is amazing. It can get a little busy around 10ish but they're usually prompt and on top of things. The \"taste bud whisperer\" is so personable and friendly and has never steered us wrong on a meal. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Amber and Mark have the best kept secret in South Tempe. Try one of the specialties and you too will be a regular"}
{"text":"Excellent food but terribly slow service.   This is a five star place. But I had to take one star away for the slow service. Not because the people are rude. On the contrary the staff is very courteous, but they feel overwhelmed. Days that I have been here, there are usually four or five folks working but only one of them is serving the ten or so tables. Just makes everything move slow.  Food here is beyond excellent. Classic eggs Benedict's is my favorite and my wife loves the chicken and waffles here. Chef Mark's hollandaise sauce is the best I have had. I have had a few note items on the menu and have never ever been disappointed. I would definitely recommend this place any day of the week."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and this quaint neighborhood breakfast spot has become my fav! I really enjoy the thought put into each menu item. My favorite is the Neptune Eggs Benedict. The dish is very light with nice crabmeat and the Hollandaise sauce over the eggs and egg McMuffin are excellent. As a shareable, the fresh baked muffin variety with homemade butter are absolutely devine!"}
{"text":"The chorizo here is just perfect - not too hot, but spicy and full of flavor! Try the biscuits with chorizo gravy, never had this anywhere before, ready to go back for more. The pico de gallo has a little bite, which is perfect for me. Great place that I hope doesn't get TOO popular that they outgrow their style and taste.  Wonderful."}
{"text":"It would be really considerate of them to let people know on their website that they're closed for vacation... Instead of just a sign at the restaurant."}
{"text":"The restaurant is small, feels crowded and has a slightly grubby feel. On hotter days it can get warm inside too, despite the ceiling fans overhead. The breakfasts here though, are very tasty.  We came here a little before 11 on a Saturday, and it was moderately busy, but there were still enough tables available that we didn't have to wait for a seat. The menu consists of breakfast and lunch, with signature egg benedict dishes, omelets, waffles, and sandwiches, just to name a few. I browsed through the benedict selections and decided on the Neptune benedict ($10.95), a Benedict with real crab meat (From a can). I ordered it with the spicy Hollandaise sauce for some extra kick. The delicate sweet flavor of the crab went well with the creamy, perfectly poached eggs and sauce, perched on top of an English muffin. I have to say, I was very impressed with the eggs they use. They are very fresh and high quality, as evidenced by the deep orange-yellow yolks.   I also tried some of the chorizo waffle, a hefty meal of superbly seasoned chorizo with a large, lightly crisp waffle.  Service was very friendly and attentive. Overall, a good place for breakfast."}
{"text":"I am visiting Tempe for a week and have sampled several breakfast spots. THIS IS THE BEST!!! Hand-cut herbed home fries, made to order Hollandaise sauce, homemade jam, cheerful waitstaff, good coffee. If I  lived here, it would be my spot every day.  Don't miss it! Deb George, from Iowa"}
{"text":"Great food and amazing service. I'm here for breakfast and a lil overwhelmed. 14 different Eggs Benedict.....Wow"}
{"text":"Great food great waitstaff. The eggs Benedict are the best in az. Highly recommend them. It does get quite busy between 8-11 so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"The biggest pancake I have ever seen. Awesome eggs bene. Excellent service. Staff is a blessing."}
{"text":"Amazing food at this simple place in an Albertsons strip mall. Me and pops will be regulars."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast!! Good price for lots of food. The pancakes are the size of a hub cap, you will only need one. Eggs Benedict(s) are also a good choice. Great place to eat."}
{"text":"This morning we decided to give this place a try after reading the positive Yelp reviews. Our experience was...okay. Nothing horrible but nothing great either.  I got the traditional eggs Benedict and my boyfriend got the Irish eggs Benedict. It was good, a little lacking in flavor but okay. The potatoes, however, were extremely bland and lacking of any seasoning. I needed to add salt and pepper to my entire meal, which came from these dirty looking tin cans sitting on the table. I noticed the portion of potatoes they gave us was extremely small, I felt gypped! I almost said something but decided not to make a fuss over it. The waitress brought us a glass jar filled with ketchup for the potatoes...I didn't like this at all. The jar had some dried ketchup on the underneath side of the glass lid and it just looked greasy on the outside with finger prints all over it. It just bothered me. I know they're trying to be cute and unique but really just leave it in the original ketchup bottle.  Also this isn't a large eatery, with only about 10 tables. The size doesn't exactly bother me but when you have a baby at the next table screaming, the entire room gets tense, you can actually feel it. But it's not the size of the room its how they use the space. The Farm House in Gilbert is also a very small space but it is extremely warm and inviting, Mark's Cafe lacks this.  FYI, if you haven't tried The Farmhouse off of Gilbert just south of Guadalupe, please do, it's incredible, but get there before 8AM or you'll be waiting in a line that goes around the building! Wonderful place!  Just a side note if the owners ever read their Yelp reviews. We noticed they were playing religious music, which didn't bother us even though we're not religious, but for the sake of respecting EVERYONE who comes into your place of business it would be a good idea to be neutral so you don't lose customers.   All in all this place was mediocre at best. I definitely felt it was over priced for what you get. Service was fast and friendly so that was a plus. However, knowing that I can get better quality, better tasting food, with cheaper prices elsewhere has me thinking we may not be back. We often go to Crackers Cafe on Elliot and Priest which is excellent. We've been there over a dozen times and every time it's a win. Wonderful food, great environment, friendly staff, and prices that make you feel like you're getting a great deal. Mark's Cafe is over priced with a lack of comfort in their decor and food."}
{"text":"Cannot say enough good things about Mark's. We had a large party and we got right in, the staff is incredibly friendly and helpful, the menu is huge without being overwhelming and the food arrived quickly and was amazing. 7 types of eggs Benedict!"}
{"text":"I felt like we won the lottery discovering this place while passing through on a business trip. I literally did a Yelp search to find somewhere local to have biscuits and gravy and this was first result. I am SOOOOO HAPPY that we did not continue looking for more options because not only were the biscuits and gravy AMAZING (traditional sausage and chorizo option 1/2 & 1/2) the server was AMAZING. They call her the \"food whisperer\" and I recommend having her make your choices. She is so nice and so great. Actually everything was great. The food, the atmosphere, the coveted \"Love muffin\" and overall EVERYTHING! I will make sure I go out of my way if ever back in the area and hit this place up again and again."}
{"text":"Awesome food! We split the Ultimate Benedict, Waffles, and Country Frittata at our table.  Love finding small and local places like Mark's Cafe. Need to support local establishments!  Wear your stretchy pants when you come here! :)"}
{"text":"Mark's Cafe is a delicious family owned and operated establishment.  A few things to note for newcomers: Arrive early. It's a small restaurant- beat the crowd and get a table.  The portions are generous.  Undecided on what to order? Have a consultation with the Tastebud Whisperer (aka Amber) and you won't be disappointed.  The homemade muffins and butters are a delightful treat- take some home for your neighbors & friends!  The staff is super friendly. Once you enter, you will be treated warmly like family!"}
{"text":"There's a reason this place was packed when we went in: it's phenomenal!  Fast, friendly service and, of course, delicious food!  Everything tasted fresh and well-flavored, and they had some really interesting specials: I had the chorizo quiche and my wife had the best California Benedict we've ever seen.  The kids had hot chocolate to drink and it was a huge cup with a huge dollop of whipped cream on top and chocolate syrup!  We live half an hour away but we will come here next time we want breakfast.  Wonderful!"}
{"text":"What a great name for a restaurant in my biased opinion.  I've tried to come to Mark's Cafe several times, and have failed.  Maybe it was for dinner, a Monday, a Tuesday, or that two weeks when everyone went on vacation.  But I never gave up.  I was on a mission to try this local favorite.  And I knew today was the day.  It was even getting close to the 2 pm close time.  But I was determined.  Luckily, no secret hand signal was needed to enter.  It was Feb. 14th and the cafe was decorated for Valentine's Day, not with something corporate concocted with branding and mailed over, but by a real human being who went to the store to buy supplies.  It was a really nice touch.  I ordered the cajun chicken club.  I was in the mood for a club, and I wanted to put Mark's Cafe to the test.  It is easy to make a bland club sandwich.  I also ordered the fries instead of the chips.  The fries were of the fresh cut variety.  And a small plastic jar with a spoon and ketchup was presented with the fries.  The sandwich was really good.  The chicken was moist and coated with Cajun spices, which was complimented well by the lettuce, tomato, and mayonnaise.  The bacon completed the sandwich.  The server was attentive and stopped by a few times.  Mark could be seen loitering around.  I was there past 2 pm, but no mention of this was made.  If you are looking for that local feel, Mark's Cafe is your restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool. We got there early to avoid the crowds as they are a tiny place with a lot of business, especially on the weekends. The staff was amazing! Please get a reading from the Food Whisperer, she will blow your mind when she predicts exactly what you want after talking to you for 30 seconds, its crazy and entertaining. Food was yummy but very rich. Go there with an empty stomach, because their yummy sauces are very filling and will last you a better part of all day lol. If your looking for a cool mom and pop breakfast joint with creative and yummy food....this place will fill your craving!"}
{"text":"Can't believe people like this place.. Mark step up your game.. Canned Corn Beef Hash!!!! Stale croissant!! Processed everything.. Being the freshness back"}
{"text":"Pulled up here on a Sunday morning and was told to expect a 1 hour wait. I thought \"ok, must be good!\" Not worth the 1 hour wait.  All ingredients are large corporation: nothing is local, nothing is fresh nor inspired.  Coffee is bland.  The French toast had way too much cinnamon and was not well mixed so you got heavy mouthfuls of cinnamon.    Service was nice with the exception of the lady who ran the credit card machine. We sat at the counter, 2 feet from her, and she made sure to let you know you were messing with her mojo if you asked for a refill of coffee which was within her reach.   All in all: an ok \"hole in the wall\" diner when in a pinch but nothing I would drive out of the way to nor worth an hour wait."}
{"text":"This place just impresses me more and more.  Remember that Roy Orbison song:  Anything you want, you got it. Anything you need, you got it. Anything at all, you got it.  Mark Vojtek is an executive chef who opened up a little breakfast place in Tempe.  His dishes are creative and delicious.  The main waitress (who is also Mark's daughter) says that she specialized in \"making dreams come true\"--that means that you can get your breakfast or lunch made to order, with any reasonable variation possible.  So, if you want to get a plate of veggies topped with sausage gravy, they'll be happy to cook it up and bring it to your table.  Really, it's no problem.  Service is friendly and generous.  The place is small, so be sure to get a seat early--it can fill up here fast!  The french toast is fantastic, the pancakes are trucker-style (gigantic), and their chocolate muffins are something that words are insufficient to describe.  Butter, just lots of butter and everything will be alright with the world--they're that good.  We love a lot of the breakfast spots around here, and Mark's was certainly on our rotation.  It's just that we have been rotating to Mark's more often as of late.  The taste and service won us over.  We think you'll agree.  The place is tucked into a corner of the strip mall where it is located, but you shouldn't have any trouble finding it with all of the cars crowded into that area of the parking lot.  It's a local, family-owned business that just happens to make some of the best food around.  If you haven't visited Mark's yet, I hope that I have now provided you with an excuse to check them out."}
{"text":"Tucked away in the back corner of the albertson's shopping center is a wonderfully quaint cafe! It's small but don't let it fool you the portions are HUGE. Everything I've tried there is FANTASTIC. The employees and sweet and they have SO many options! A must try, I will be back often! :)"}
{"text":"Even though Mark has had a heart attack and only goes occasionally on the weekends, the food and staff have not missed a beat. Super friendly service and delicious food. Love the unique specials such as chorizo stuffed waffles and the Bene burger."}
{"text":"Best Breakfast spot around, it's got that small town pancake House vibe, while also keeping the coziness of a coffee shop. Order off menu, mix two or three dishes together it doesn't matter, the kitchen will literally make anything breakfast related and it's always the best. Don't forget to order a side of gravy!"}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed with this place. There was a bug in my water, the bacon was over cooked and my date didn't really like his French toast. I could've made it way better for him. The only good aspect about this place was the waitress. She was super nice, and super enthusiastic. I more than likely will not be going back. It just didn't cut it for me.   On our way out I saw why there was a bug in my water! They had glasses of water on standby near the front area. So you're not getting a fresh new cup of water.  I just wasn't a fan, it was nothing personal."}
{"text":"My favorite 3 dishes: Eggs Benedict, Biscuits and Gravy, Kielbasa scramble. I love the feel of this mom/pop cafe. The service is wonderful. I have also been to their Friday Night dinners. Love the BYOB concept and the special menus. It's nice to know who exactly is cooking your meal. The only thing I wish was that they never closed for vacation!"}
{"text":"Just wanted to continue to give kudos to this place. We now make a point to go at least once a month. The grilled muffins are a delight. I'm in love with the Scottish eggs Benedict. The raspberry butter is where it's at."}
{"text":"The food was your average breakfast items.. The only issue we had was staff.. They were too busy chit chatting behind the counter.. It took them forever to bring us the bill.. They were too busy discussing what ppl were saying about them on Yelp then checking on their customers.."}
{"text":"Mark is a talented chef - his specialty hollandaise sauce is the best I've ever had.  Biscuits and gravy are wonderful - not thick and lumpy white stuff - flavorful and always served HOT.  Order the chorizo  gravy if you like spice.  Pancakes are light and fluffy, waffles are great too.  Order a muffin as soon as you are seated - it is served cut in half, buttered and grilled.  Lunch?  The hamburgers are big and juicy; all the sandwiches are filling - no skimping on ingredients. Amber (Mark's daughter) runs this small cafe and remembers the \"usual\" for the regular customers.  You'll be taken care of like family.  Great service and great food.  If you are looking for the local breakfast joint, this is it!"}
{"text":"A Hole in the wall breakfast spot! I got myself the Chicken & Waffles and man was I surprised with how well everything they had went together! I will definitely be back again for more and different food they offer."}
{"text":"What a cute little breakfast place! It's a bit pricey but I really do find the food tasty. I love that it's me and bf's go to place for our breakfast date."}
{"text":"I continue to explore local restaurants in my neighborhood and again, I'm very happy with another great find. Mark's Cafe food & service is great... Be careful when you ask for Pancakes as they are HUGE!!! Order just 1 or get the special and split with a friend. Also had the California Eggs Benedict and the potatoes were really good! This place is now officially added to breakfast options for the family!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. I had the traditional eggs Benedict with home fries and it was wonderful. I will be going back very soon."}
{"text":"Service is good. Was kind of hard to find bc it's located in a strip mall facing rural north of Guadalupe. Food portions are huge but taste wise just ok. I had the everything omelet and hubby had the Scottish eggs Benedict. The Benedict sauce was good but bread a bit tough. Omelet was just ok w home fries and English muffin."}
{"text":"Based on one review...I am willing to give them a second chance...perhaps I picked the wrong items or it was just a bad day?!?   Me and kids took a spin and visited.  Small cozy restaurant in a strip mall.  Service staff was better than average.  Food was ok.  I ordered some sort of scramble plate....3 eggs scramble with (steak, onions, cheese, schrroms), home-style potatoes, and English muffin.  Kids both ordered Denver.  The egg scramble part of my meal had a good taste, better than expected. The home-style potatoes left me wanting more flavor....they were plain with little seasoning.  A hint of a little bit of crust on them would have helped.  Also, I was expecting a skillet-like presentation (scramble on top of potatoes maybe?)....instead, I got a pile of scramble, with potatoes next to it.  The kids liked the Denver, but barely touched their potatoes.  They too love potatoes and told me after eating they didnt care for them.  Lots of good reviews, perhaps just unlucky today?!?"}
{"text":"I had quiche, it was excellent. The pancake fills the plate and then some! The French toast has 8 slices. Everything comes with potatoes and English muffins. Service was quick and friendly.  I would not recommend it for folks in a wheelchair the space is small."}
{"text":"I visited again today with a couple different friends. I went with the same Scottish eggs Benedict, as I knew it was a winner. And it didn't disappoint again.   But my friends tried the unruly omelets. They were super excited about them. In the end, they were both not impressed. They mentioned the vegetables didn't seem fresh (possibly were frozen veggies) and they just were not good or worth eating.    It was much busier this time and while the staff was friendly and working hard, it seemed as if it wasn't a very efficient system."}
{"text":"Don't miss this place and don't skip the grilled muffin(s). Great little place with fantastic service and food."}
{"text":"Great breakfast. Delicious poached eggs, very good Greek omlete, and our 6 year old daughter liked the strawberry yogurt parfait. Recommended."}
{"text":"My son and I wanted to find a new breakfast place so I looked on Yelp.  All the reviews were very good and they were not wrong.  The people were so nice and the food was delicious.  Can not wait to go back and try some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"If you hate delicious food, do NOT come here!!!  The only thing better than the benedicts, is the outstanding service. Bell & Amber made food dreams come true and happen to be adorable as well! The table ordered southwest Benedict, Irish Benedict, and the Neptune Benedict. All delicious. The only downside was a tiny side of hollandaise sauce costs an extra $3.25.  Oh, and order the homemade grilled muffins. You won't regret it. That's a fact, jack!!"}
{"text":"Decent place for breakfast, nothing special though. No coffee other than hot regular, sounded like teas had several options."}
{"text":"Not sure how this place got 4 and half stars.... it was a real disappointment! I've never had to battle with my pancake To cut it, it was like rubber! Also 4 pieces of sausage cost us $8.00 what a joke, we could have gotten another meal for that price. very dirty and the bathroom was gross. Was excited to try this place but it was a let down.  Also the server aka the taste bud whisper was very load and annoying she wanted to order for me. Won't be going back to this place."}
{"text":"This little hidden gem is one of the best breakfasts places that I have ever been to! My girl and I were out hunting for a place to go get breakfast. Of course it had to be on a weekend & every single place that we wanted to go to was packed. I came across this place on Yelp & decided to try it out. Luckily, we were seated right away. This place is so tiny!!  I can not begin to explain how good the food was here. Portions were big & the prices were fair. Service was excellent.   Had to use the bathroom during my visit, it's kind of funny because you literally have to walk through the kitchen to get to the rest room. Was kinda cool seeing all the cooks at work. Haha"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! We came from Vegas to visit and found this place and everything about it was great! Service was awesome and the food was YUMMY!! I would definitely go back if I'm ever in AZ again :)"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful great food!!! Great service they are all so friendly. Was so good that we went back two mornings in a row"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place! Amber...the tastebud whisperer was phenomenal...when she tells you to trust her on menu suggestions, just go with it!! Seriously Amber thank you for making our morning, you are a special woman and your light shines bright. Best service and dining experience I've had in a very long time!!! This is a family owned and run establishment and the grilled muffins are to die for! This is my new favorite way to start a day! Get there early or you'll be waiting for a while!"}
{"text":"Marks is the best breakfast place in Tempe! The food is outstanding and then there is the service you will be made to feel like family in your very first visit. Chicken Fried Steak and eggs is the best!"}
{"text":"Diamond in the rough. This was our first time to Mark's, it won't be out last. We came for breakfast based on a recommendation we were NOT disappointed at all. The service was friendly and always with a smile. We were invited to sit wherever we liked and immediately were brought water. The eggs were cooked and seasoned perfectly, the most amazing part of breakfast was the pancakes. They were huge, airy and cooked all the way though. They had amazing flavor and really hit the spot. This little cafe in Tempe is a place that should not be missed."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Amber was a very engaging waitress! She was ready to answer questions and give suggestions. I had the ultimate eggs Benedict (replaced the meat with smoked salmon. The sampler of muffins - turned me in to a muffin snob. . I would definitely recommend the place. The only thing I'm upset about is that i was just passing thru and probably will never be back. Sad."}
{"text":"Just wow.   This little Mom and Pop breakfast place is absolutely amazing.   Our server was passionate and knowledgable about the menu and was able to recommend additions to our orders to match what we really wanted. She was patient and so nice (and her name escapes me, but she's the daughter of the owner), and I would go back for her alone, but the rest of the experience was amazing as well.   The service was well-paced and everyone was attentive with our water levels and making sure we had everything we needed.   The food was unbelievably good. I got the three egg scramble with chorizo and it was out of this world.   The portions are large so there is plenty to take home. If you're looking to try a new breakfast/brunch/lunch place, this is the spot to go!"}
{"text":"Quaint mom n pop type place we chose for a late breakfast after ASU devils killed the Utah Utes the night before at 2014 Homecoming! Delicious!  Loved our server, the Tastebud whisperer helped us figure out how to please our palettes with the right flavor combos! My husband and I sat in the back with our 10 month old daughter, and we're quickly greeted and offered beverages by a boy about Ten years old whom our server said was her little brother helping out! :-)  We saw lots that interested us on the menu, so our helpful server guided us to the perfect options to tantalize our tastebuds! We settled on  regular coffee, but I noticed a couple chalk and dry erase boards with a more creative selection of beverages and daily kitchen specials.        My husband almost always gets pancakes,  or an omlette, so it's no shocker that he picked the Banana Pecan pancakes with a side of cheese eggs and bacon. I, however, am a sucker for a creative Benedict. It was a tough choice given the array of Benedict options, but the Scottish caught my eye. It was an English muffin topped with smoked salmon, poached eggs, served with seasoned breakfast potatoes,  and I was given a choice of regular or spicy hollandaise.  I chose spicy, which was perfect.   We enjoyed it!  Definitely plan to visit again when we are back in Tempe."}
{"text":"Service was amazing and portions are huge. Everything was a la carte. If I were local, I'd be a regular. I'm so happy I found it."}
{"text":"Service was excellent and food was great too. Pricing was decent but seating is limited so first come first served."}
{"text":"We love having this gem of a local cafe in our neighborhood. Always great food with great service at great prices.  Best to arrive early for breakfast to avoid a line!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff with a good menu selection. We have been here a couple of times and customer service never disappoints. However, the food can be off and does not taste fresh.bwe got an omelette and a frittata with a side of potatoes. The potatoes were definitely not fresh and tasted as though they had been sitting for a while. Also our food came out within 5 minutes of ordering even when the restaurant was packed, a good sign of pre made to order food."}
{"text":"Always a fan of this great little breakfast spot! Mark's is consistent, delicious, and always great service."}
{"text":"Sever Amber is the official \"taste bud whisperer!\" Ask her when you are stumped about what to order. Also Chef Mark will customize your meal if you have a preference or food allergy. Love that he's so flexible!"}
{"text":"What a great family owned breakfast spot.  We are always searching for new mom chain restaurants,  and this is a place we will revisit!  Food was amazing.  I had the chorizo waffle.  Sounds odd,  I know.  It was heaven. Shredded cheese,  sour cream,  pico. So fantastic. Hubby ordered the corned beef and eggs. He really enjoyed them.  We shared biscuits and gravy which were fabulous.    The server was friendly and i enjoyed Mark's singing from the window!    Love this place!"}
{"text":"Still same amazing food. I've tried a handful of different items. My favourites include the country frittata, the raspberry French toast, the grilled muffins with raspberry butter, and my standard go to order of chicken and waffles with sausage gravy and no egg on top. The service tho is outstanding. I moved to Maryland in May and came back here about a week ago and guess what: AMBER REMEMBERED MY EXACT ORDER! Super friendly, family owned, delicious food. This is easily the best breakfast place in the world. I miss it already *sighs*"}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and we stopped in for breakfast. Everyone was very nice- our waitress was unbelievably sweet - between the amazing customer service and great food it's 10 stars in my book!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best food, awesome service, and great find if you're a foodie!!!!! The banana and pecan pancakes are to die for and the eggs are fluffy and so yummy! Chicken fried steak is the best we've ever had and the bacon is perfect!"}
{"text":"I ordered the ultimate eggs Benedict, a side of 4 bacons and a 6oz side of the chorizo gravy. I killed that shit but boy I'm paying the price! The place was packed and getting seated was slow. But the service and food MORE than made up for it. 5 stars, I would eat there again but i would make sure i have nothing important to do the rest of the day cause that gravy will put you down!"}
{"text":"Today was our first time at this Cafe and I'm sure it will not be our last! Food was delicious and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Bomb, bomb, bomb!   Outstanding service, great attitude,  very very tasty food!  Only negative, small room.  But other than that don't pass his place up!   This is my spot!"}
{"text":"This place is really good.  Went there for the first time today and had to wait about 10 minutes which I hear is t bad even though it was a Friday.  Place is pretty small but gives it charm.  Waitresses were short staffed but they were still super friendly.  The owner \"mark\" is very nice as well.  The waitress pretty much ordered my food for me and I'm glad she did, food is amazing will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast on a Sunday morning. The weather was beautiful so I sat on the patio. My waitress was Amber AKA \"Taste Bud Whisperer\". I will start by saying Amber was very personable and swears she will remember my name by what I order. When I return (and I will) I am going to test her. I ordered the biscuits and gravy with a side of country potatoes. Amber asked if I wanted half the order with chorizo gravy. I had never tried that so I did. The meal was out in a very short time. I asked for hot sauce for the potatoes. She said we have about 40 different kinds. I was thoroughly impressed. I also found out that they make their own catsup. It was pretty good. The Biscuits were swimming in gravy, ok maybe drowning. I thought the biscuits were a little chewy and kind of small. The country potatoes were nicely done. I wish I had ordered toast or something to take up the excess gravy which was delicious. It seems like a waste to not use all that good gravy.  Well breakfast is a hit. Next time I will do lunch. Maybe I'll get a burger or the Philly steak sandwich."}
{"text":"This place is my go to for breakfast. The food surpasses anything I've had in this country. A must have for anyone local or traveling through."}
{"text":"Off-the-hook delish. You just can't go wrong with this family-run gem. Mark may be cooking away, but Amber is the heart and soul of this place running the front. I will be there as often as my waistline allows!"}
{"text":"Another one of my favorite breakfast spots. This small, family run business is thriving in our neighborhood and make the best \"made to order\" breakfasts. If you don't know what you feel like eating the waitresses will read your mind and put a plethora of items together with amazing homemade goodness!! This place makes my mouth water."}
{"text":"Awesome little family owned restaurant! Service was awesome and the food was great! Their spicy benedict sauce was the best! We ordered the Neptune, Scottish and Irish benedicts and all were amazing!!!"}
{"text":"We had excellent service from the owner. She was so sweet when she provided our son with toys and talked with us. However, we were more than a bit disappointed with the food. The muffins were from Costco. My hash was from a can, and the food was generally bland. However, the hollandaise sauce was homemade and the eggs were cooked perfectly. I guess we were just looking for a meal where most of the ingredients were fresh and made in house. That's why we go out to eat! I can open a can and throw something together at home."}
{"text":"Had my first breakfast at mark's cafe today and it was a great experience. Breakfast is my favorite meal to eat out and being new to the area I'm searching for a regular spot. This might be it. The food was great. I had the corned beef hash benedict which tasted great and was just the right amount of food for me. I love eggs benedict and love they always have at least 7 to choose from. The rest of the menu looked great and I was impressed with the service. I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 for 2 reasons. I liked the coffee just fine but didn't love it and when I got my bill it was a little more than I expected. Again I'm new to the area so the price might be right on par with other breakfast spots around. I'd give it a 4.5 if that was an option."}
{"text":"Great place to have a breakfast. Great customer service and great food. You can bring your own champagne in to make mimosas"}
{"text":"I had read some reviews of Mark's Cafe on Yelp and as a lover of Eggs Benedict wanted to try their signature dish. I ordered the Neptune Eggs Benedict which is made with crab meat. The hollandaise sauce was among the best I have had. It delivered a lemony taste that wasn't over powering. I often find that chefs use lemon as a food coloring in hollandaise rather than the key ingredient. The sauce will bring me back to try the traditional Eggs Benedict.   I was disappointed with the Neptune because nothing was done to the crab meat to enhance it as far as I could tell.  In this variation that I have enjoyed elsewhere the crab was in a Maryland style crab cake and had a nice texture to it. Here the crab was piled on the muffin without any flair or additional flavoring. It just wasn't that special the way it was served.  The accompanying potatoes tasted fine but I like my potatoes to have a little crust on them. These were soft and lacking the character added by the fry pan.  I will go back to try other menu items. The hollandaise is exceptional and other menu items have me curious. As you cannot judge a book by its cover you cannot judge a chef by one dish."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere, has that great family feel, and to die for food! The chorizo Benedict was by far the best Benedict I've ever eaten, eggs were perfect and hash was so so yummy! My husband had the ultimate chorizo Chicken and waffle. I don't know if I've ever tasted a better gravy then the chorizo gravy on it. A++ keep doing what you do, we will definitely be back when we're in town."}
{"text":"We will be back. Had the biscuits and gravy and the California Benedict. But the best part was the truth of grilled muffins.  I can't say enough on how  great the service and food was."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. We liked the English muffin better than the croissant. We also got the chicken fried steak and the gravy was some of the best I've ever had. The potatoes were good too."}
{"text":"In general, I'm not a huge breakfast fan and don't like to eat eggs but fortunately, I was able to find things on the menu that I would eat. In reviewing Yelp prior, there were a lot of pictures of the biscuits and gravy. So naturally, I tried the biscuits and gravy. I got half sausage gravy and half chorizo gravy. I liked the sausage gravy better but if you like a kick, you'd probably like the chorizio gravy better. I would get that dish again when I go back. I also got the raspberry french toast. I didn't think it was anything special but I don't think I would order it again. Overall, I would say it was alright. I wasn't necessarily in love with what I got but I'd be willing to go back and give it another try. I got there at 8 and didn't have to wait for a table but by 9 when I left, it was packed. I was most attracted by the small business feel and they are definitely doing things right. I'd support them over a lot of places. Also, the service was fabulous!"}
{"text":"We LOVED our breakfast from Mark's, and all the good reviews are true!  First and foremost, the service was fantastic. We just ordered pickup, but felt valued and important - both over the phone and in person, making the payment and getting the food. The women I dealt with were both fantastic, super friendly, warm, kind - I felt like we were friends, even after just talking a short while!  Second, and perhaps most importantly - the food was phenomenal. We got the half/half biscuits and gravy (sausage and chorizo), and it was so decadent, so well done, so tasty. I would have eaten it again, later that same day...maybe even right then! I also got the frittata, which was loaded with yummy ingredients, and perfectly cooked. Loved that they included our choice of jam for my toast, and the home fries were delicious.  Lastly, the price was right. This place does great food, for a fair price, and the 4.5 star rating is accurate!! Give them your love and your money. We will be back when we come back to the Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"I have been to tons of breakfast restaurants around the valley. Today was my first time here and it blew me away. It has surpassed my previous top breakfast destinations by a large margin. Will be back here soon. Also I highly recommend asking Amber for suggestions on the menu."}
{"text":"I recently moved in to Tempe from south Scottsdale so I am on the hunt of some delicious breakfast spots. Mark's did not disappoint. Remember the show Cheers? That is basically this place. The staff are so friendly it was actually amazing! The dog friendly patio was a big perk as well because I love taking my fur baby to hang out with me when I can.   As far as the food goes I had biscuits and gravy and they were delish. Very stick to your ribs, good. My cute little date had a chocolate chip pancake that was bigger than her tiny head. (She's 3 so her head is pretty tiny.) The pancake was very yummy as well.   This is a place that I will revisit without hesitation and even if there is a line outside don't expect to wait around long. They're very quick and the food is worth a quick 15min wait."}
{"text":"What a gem not only is the food the best we have had out here the hospitality and warmth of this family owned business is unmatched! The muffins are stupid good and we don't even like muffins! Eggs Benedict delicious and what particularly appreciated as a foody is they let you mix and match if you want to try things. Or get a half a muffin so u can try multiple types! We will look forward to eating here when we are in town and wish nothing but good energy to these very nice people. It's a family run business that is very busy so you may wait or need to have a little patience but it's oh so worth it! Mmm till we meet again haha!"}
{"text":"WOW!! My husband told me about this place & the famous food whisperer waitress.... he was so right!! We got there early, right when they opened, and were greeted by a friendly staff & Mark at the food service window. Our waitress asked me about 5 questions & nailed something delicious for me to eat - eggs Benedict over biscuits instead of English muffin, half of the order with traditional hollandaise sauce, the other half with chorizo & extra crispy potatoes. Who is this lady?! She spoke right to my pregnant belly & it was AMAZING. I can't believe I've never eaten here. We will be back for sure.   P.S. if you sit near the food service window you can hear who I presume was Mark happily singing as he prepares food... gives you the warm & fuzzies of being in a local restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is a little hard to find and small because it is mom and pop style dining but that does not take away from the delicious food that comes out. I had a Belgium waffle with banana and pecan syrup, two eggs over easy and two huge sausage links! My wife had the California  eggs Benedict. Both plates were loaded with food so what you pay for is what you get. We shared a cup of coffee and so with tip and all it turned out to be about 30 bucks total. Definately reminds me of the farmhouse in Gilbert. Lastly the staff was very nice and friendly from start to end and was very attentive to refills and if we were satisfied. I plan to recommend others to this place and bring family."}
{"text":"We tried several other restaurants in the area, it's Spring Training season, however Mark's Cafe did not have lines out the door, but good ratings and not too far from the hotel. And the right price for a group of 7 with little to no waiting (even for a smallish restaurant).  Perfect!!  The best part was their Egg's Benedict, called \"The Ultimate Egg's Benedict\" we also got some comments from other guests. It's a must have!  A few of the children of Mark's works here, very nice family, and great family owned restaurant. This means quality. I definitely look forward to coming back here again."}
{"text":"Our whole family enjoyed our trip to Mark's cafe.  Great food with great service!  They provide dry erase markers at your table to draw on them.  The kids thought that was awesome. Go check this place out.  You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped into Mark's Cafe today for breakfast.  My wife had the 3 egg chorizo plate and I had the bacon and egg frittata.  I loved my meal and so did my wife.  It came out fast, hot and fresh.   We both ordered sides of bacon and they were  also fantastic.  The coffee was very good which is a huge part of an enjoyable breakfast in my opinion.  We tried both reg and decaf.    This place is a small little restaurant in a corner space in a shopping plaza.  It is clean and family oriented.  Mark's isn't a fancy place but it's not trying to be.  It's a small cafe serving excellent food at fair prices.  If you're looking for a good breakfast in a comfortable environment then this place should not disappoint.    In today's world of big chains and \"take a number\" mentality, it's nice to eat at a place that not only serves excellent food but does so with the care and attention that let's you know that your patronage is valued.  Before we left we had an opportunity to speak with both the owner (Mark) and his daughter.  Very pleasant, caring and genuine people who are committed to their business and the quality of their food and service.    Folks, this place just had their 10 year anniversary.  In the restaurant business you don't make 10 years if you're not doing something right.   We will be back and we will be recommending this place to friends and family as well.  PS - We enjoyed the music.  Nice to have the positive encouragement being conveyed through the music being played."}

{"text":"Although Mark, apparently looks a lot like me, I am not the owner of Marks Cafe!  That said, the menu, look-n-feel and overall vibe of this lunch, brunch and breakfast-all-day, family restaurant mirrors the vibe I would go for of I we're the owner.  This is a solid, reasonably-priced restaurant with good food, excellent service and a basic, no-frills, coffee shop atmosphere!"}
