{"text":"Used to be a big fan when they were located on the ground floor. It tastes completely different after they moved to the upper level :("}
{"text":"We all know Pacific Mall (@ThePacificMall), the largest indoor Chinese mall in North America, is synonymous with retail shops selling bubble tea, phone cases & accessories, fake designer bags, electronics & DVDs, and even rims!    But I always crave fish balls when I am there. My go-to place has always been on the first floor.  So you can imagine my shock when I initially discovered the space was replaced with a nail salon!  But fear not, the aptly named Fish Ball Place was relocated to the second floor food court.  It's a great place to stop by for an afternoon snack ranging from fish & beef balls to tripe & Taiwanese sausage!"}
{"text":"After so much bubble tea and dessert in pmall,  I was craving meat. These snacks for $1.50 did the trick. Just satisfying enough"}
{"text":"There were a lot of people swarming around this place so I followed the crowd.  The verdict -- okay food, not bad nor great.   Curry Fish balls were so so, I prefer the ones from Food Jungle, a bubble tea shop in the food court by escalator  Fish siu mai tasted more starchy than fishy, i wouldn't order again.  But there are plenty of other street food choices on the menu, I can be motivated to go back again."}
{"text":"I remember this family started out as a tiny convenience store in the south-east corner of the first floor of Pacific Mall. They were selling beef balls and fish balls right from there and there would always be a line up! I use to go there all the time (it was a must every time I went to the mall) cause their curry base was really good. I thought they had closed down until I discovered their current location (quite hidden if you don't go to the end of the second floor). I decided to get their beef balls and beef tripe and it was good but certainly something was missing. I'd still go there but not as often as I use to. Also, they never look busy compared to their previous location."}
{"text":"One of the few things I (80%) do when I go to Pacific Mall or P-Mall is to get bubble tea, get curry/spicy fishballs and egg waffles! Or to grab a phone case, screen protector, gifts for friends... but on a more common basis, I come for the snacks!  This is my ultimate fav curry/spicy fishball place to grab snacks from!   The prices are cheap, unless you're ordering off one of the more unique food orders like mussel or escargot. I always get the spicy fishballs and tripe whereas the Boyfriend gets the spicy beef ball, lobster balls or tripe. One stick of fishballs/beef balls is $1.20, I believe, and that's probably the most ordered from their store.   They have a non-spicy version as well but I don't think it's a high level of spice. The terms of curry fishball or spicy fishball is interchangable to me so don't get confused, hahaah.  You order from one side and get your order from the other side. Sometimes they give you a number and they'll call it out. Service is usually pretty fast as it's just snacks. However, they don't usually provide a lot of tissue so be wary of that.. and their tissues are pretty thin so you can ask for more if you'd like.  This place never disappoints and it's a simple snack/meal to satisfy my tastes and usually makes my trip to PMall worthwhile! Plus it's usually not a long line up, so give it a go! I can't promise you won't be left craving for more..."}
{"text":".               Curry Fish Balls                         ($1.50)                         ---------  Quintessential Hong Kong Aphrodisiac.   Well, as much as Oysters anyways. Want your Balls spicy or non-spicy? There's only one TRUE option, you know.  An outdoor Fish Ball cart should be in order. Doesn't feel the same when it's indoors. Imagine along Queen st. Shops with a skewer... Dripping Curry Sauce everywhere{1} while shopping...  That's how it's done.  -------------- {1} HK-style is all about walking and snacking in unison.      Hint:  Do not mix that with Korean or Japanese culture."}
{"text":"Hk style curry fish balls!!! This is my favourite snack whenever I go to hong kong.  This store is located in Pacific mall on the 2nd level near the back.    There are a wide variety of skewers you could choose from.  Today I just got the fish balls and beef balls as a snack.    They were already prepared on the side and dipped into the spicy curry sauce and served in a Styrofoam cup.  It was a little messy eating it with all the sauce at the bottom.  They were 1.50/skewer and the best thing is that taxes were included :)   Its not the same as hong kong especially with the atmosphere but sure tones down the craving until my next trip to hong kong."}
{"text":"This will probably be my choice of fish ball place from now on. The fish ball curry has a spice kick to it unlike the other places I've tried and I love it! Their other snacks are good as well but I prefer the fish balls better. Its such a shame their far from where I lived but its a treat for sure when I come by pacific mall.  I highly recommend them for sure!"}
{"text":"Woot love this place for their beef and pork balls :)  Not a fan of their fish balls though."}
{"text":"Its yummy street food inside a mall. What more can I say.  There are many other food stalls in this part of p-mall so it can get quite busy especially on weekends. So when you are walking and trying to eat your fish balls it can be quite a challenge. Walking and bumping into people while trying to shove food in your mouth is harder than it sounds.  The food is pretty good. The fish ball sauce is quite yummy and you can pretty much drizzle that sauce over anything and it will taste good."}
{"text":"Delicious sauce and a pretty big selection of items for cheap :) I would only come here to have their fish balls and those kinds of things, I've bought the bubble tea sometimes because I was lazy to go to anther store and thought I would get thirsty, but I always end up throwing away like half of it :("}
{"text":"This is the place to go if you want to have anything on a stick. Like beef balls, fish balls, pork balls and everything intestine. Been at pmall since forever and still pretty much the same. Pretty much $1.50 - $3.00 for anything,.. good if you want a quick bite."}
{"text":"Wanted a little snack and saw this place. Got the curry fish ball to try and it was pretty good. They pre-make the fishballs and leave them in the sauce so it sits there for a bit. It didn't have that crisp bite to it like it was just cooked. But I would come back for another snack if need be because the price is really cheap. $1.50 for a stick of four fish balls!!"}
{"text":"Not the best fish ball place anymore, but still good. Has anybody else noticed that their sauce isn't as strong anymore?! I remember the days when their curry fish balls were actually spicy! Now, it tastes watered down and ..not so flavourful.   Regardless, they're still better than most places and I still come here for the balls and tripe. Delicious enough and cheap with a variety of items to choose from.  Whatever they did to their sauce, I hope they change it back to how it used to taste."}
{"text":"Curry Fish Balls! Fake Shark Fin Soup! Minced Fish in Soup!   Street Snacks and Comfort Food for a lot of people that growing up in Hong Kong.  Fish Ball Place is located inside Heritage Place at Pacific Mall.  Fish Ball $1.50 a skewer came with 5 fish balls was A-OK! You have a choice of spicy or non spicy version. Not as good as what I had when I was younger... but I found food tasted better in memories..."}
{"text":"great price for beef balls, quick service. I usually just get a lot of beef balls because the other items don't pack a flavour kick as strong as them without being too pricey."}
{"text":"In all honesty I would give it half a star. The customer service there was literally the worst. Sometime the beef ball would taste good and sometime it wouldn't, so it is very inconsistent. They talk behind your back in cantonese (probably) and gives your stares. I would never go back there again."}
{"text":"Love the fish ball and beef balls here. There's a nice kick to the curry sauce. Reminds me so much of Hong Kong."}
