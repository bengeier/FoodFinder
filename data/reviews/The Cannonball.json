{"text":"Was really displeased with the staff. Unbelievably unwelcome environment. Rude to boot. Every other business in the area is super friendly but I wouldn't head back here. I think they were upset to see a baby but I nursed her, she was quiet and they were empty. The irony is that we love coffee and very soon we'll be stopping somewhere on our way to work. Not there however!"}
{"text":"Service was great and the atmosphere is just the best! I had brunch with some friends on the patio in the back and it was like entering a different world. The music was very well chosen and even the washrooms had the same cool rustic appearance as the rest of the café. Beautifully decorated and the food was amazing.

I ordered a simple bagel with cream cheese but my friends got a breakfast sandwich that they couldn't stop talking about. It just felt so quaint and I really want to go back again!"}
{"text":"I dropped by yesterday to have a snack and to read for a couple of hours.

The decor is pretty clean and simple. One might perhaps describe it as homey. The tables are nice and large. There is a collection of magazines to peruse while sipping your drink. The barrista was pleasant and fairly efficient.

First I ordered a London Fog and an egg salad sandwich (grilled). I am not sure why London Fog was the most expensive drink on the menu -- it's made with a tea bag, for Chrissake -- but it tasted fine. The sandwich seemed very simple -- just egg salad and a couple of standard toppings -- but the egg for the egg salad was cooked just perfectly, and it was surprisingly delicious paired with the slice of brie.

For my second round I got a cappucino and a blueberry poppy-seed muffin. The cappucino was well done and the muffin was fresh and very tasty. Don't let the simplicity of decor and menu fool you -- the food and drinks here are crafted with care, by someone who knows his stuff. And oh, they are licensed and have Mill Street beer on tap!

So, why only three stars? The HOURS!  5 p.m. closing time -- and closed on Sundays? Bye-bye, see you at linuxcaffe!"}
{"text":"Pleasant surprise as I had some extra time to kill transferring from the 504 to 502 streetcars (first stop after the DVP, and way nicer than the Broadview and Queen corner). 

Since they have coffee in their name, must try their coffee to see if it even compares to Broadview Espresso (my favourite). Ordered a small Americano, and it looks like they have two sizes. The coffee is ok, just a little too burnt tasting for me, and the sleeve is also a little big for the cup so keeps slipping when I put it down, so I give it 3 stars for the coffee. 

However as I was ordering my coffee, notices that they had chocolate scones, so could not resist! \"They're delicious and homemade!\" Best decision of my day. Chocolate chips were still melty (should have grabbed more napkins) and the base is flaky and crusty. While I might not return for the coffee, I might come back for the baked goods!

Total bill for coffee and best scone ever: $4.82"}
{"text":"Came for the patio which was highly recommended in reviews.  Was 'decrepit' looking with a collection of 'junk' on one side, including a cat crate and a pile of grungy looking patio pillows.  On the main patio area - a rusted table and chairs aside the small flimsy wooden tables, a rusted freestanding firepit, a few pieces of garbage, a milk crate and what appeared to be a dog ball in the middle of the patio. Looked more 'closed' than 'open'; not very inviting to say the least. 

Sandwich was tasty although served with a few salt and vinegar ripple potato chips.

Won't be back and was definitely not the charming patio experience we were looking for on such a beautiful summer's  day."}
{"text":"Americano was delicious. Breakfast sandwich was solid. Staff was friendly. Seemed like a cool spot if you live in the neighborhood (was visiting from NYC)"}
{"text":"Said I'd come back to try their breakfast, and I did this morning.

Got the breakfast bagel with ham. The portion was huge for the price. Everything was so fresh and, as others have noted, not microwaved, but properly, carefully prepared. You'll wait longer for a breakfast bagel here than in a lot other places, but it's worth it for the quality when you dig in!

Loved how I was given so many options with the bagel, as well. I could choose my cheese, my toppings, my bagel bread, and was given the option of with or without ham. This was done on a cute little multiple choice form. This level of customer care at a busy cafe early on a weekday morning is so impressive.

Their americano is also even better than what I remember. YUM."}
{"text":"Coffee is tasty, and they have a great but quaint menu of food. I was offered over five different kinds of cheese before settling on the smoked mozzarella for my breakfast sandwich. The tomato basil soup was a bit garlicky for my taste, but it's the only thing that's keeping me from giving 5 stars."}
{"text":"Nice hidden back patio (just ask), best cookies around and their tuna sandwich (grilled) is fantastic.  Prices reasonable."}
{"text":"My favorite sandwich shop on the east end. I go there as much as my eating out budget allows. Great bread, ingredients, coffee, and draft beer! The atmosphere and service is very nice as well."}
{"text":"one of the best chocolate-chip cookies in the city, yum.  The coffee beans come from Merchants of Green Coffee so the coffee is very fresh.  The double Americano is perfect--a little sweet, very smooth and strong!"}
{"text":"Nice looking spot, the guy at the counter was surly and had a bad attitude. We got a breakfast bagel and bagel with cream cheese and vegetables with two Americanos for almost $18. The coffee was pretty good but the food was a major disappointment. First they gave us the wrong order which we realized after we left, when I went back (our bagels were waiting for us) and got our true order and opened it up, I was shocked. There was barely any cream cheese on it and the bagel was sliced a quarter of an inch from the bottom, it wasn't even toasted. Just a poorly made sandwich.

I have worked in food service and there is no way I would have given that to someone.

Go to Tim Hortons and save your money and avoid the bad vibes."}
{"text":"It's very quiet in here but they play English eighties rock. Good place to sit down and read a book. Half-pints and full pints of local beer on tap. They have a mellow older crowd and also a couple students. There's a no-cellphones sign on the counter and a bunch of common room magazines. I like it."}
{"text":"There are coffee shops that take their business seriously - high quality coffee, good equipment, skilled servers who learn drinks that aren't on the menu and practice latte art - and those that fill space.  This place is in the latter group.  The server (who I believe is the owner) didn't really hear my request and ad-libbed some unwanted foam, the temperature was too hot, and the coffee not the best.

Too many other good places around to rush back here.

*They got an extra star 'cause it's a little indie coffee shop trying to make a place in this odd block on Queen E."}
{"text":"Nice, laid back coffee spot. Casual interior with mis-matched furniture and vintage travel posters. The overall vibe is a nice change from so-hip-it-hurts spots that seem to proliferate across the city. The kind of place that goes well with a chunky knit sweater and a great conversationalist!"}
{"text":"Really warm and welcoming atmosphere to come into on a cold February day. I don't come to the east end much but I'm glad I did to check this place out. It's nice to get out of your own hood sometimes to see what other little communities are doing in Toronto. That's exactly how this place feels to me, a little community. Everyone said hi to everyone else and they all seemed to know each other. Am I actually on the set of a new friends-esque Tv show??

I had my coffee quota for the day but I was feeling pretty hungry so I opted for the smoked turkey sammy which 100% hit the spot. 

Also I'm Always a fan on coffeeshops that serve beers/liquor too. Pretty much my dream to own a little place like this."}
{"text":"I tried F'Coffee during the 2010 Indie Coffee Passport, and it's taken me this long to stop cringing at having to give it 2 stars and just dive right in there. 

The positives are - cute little cafe (with a patio), nice easy to get to location. 

But the coffee (soy latte) that I got was so terrible that i'm not going to be back. Not even to give them a second chance in case that barista had been huffing used coffee grounds. The shot was bitter, and was pretty much overpowered by the scalded soy milk anyhow. No thank you. If i'm in the area i'll make the extra effort to visit Mercury or Merchants, where the baristas will pay more attention.

F'Coffee, you shouldn't even let that word be in your name! Why."}
{"text":"OK, I guess I'm addicted. You wont find better than this place, you may find similar but it wont be The Cannonball.  I also forgot to mention in my earlier comments... the breakfast bagel for $3.75 tax in.... they pan fry the egg, not microwaved like most. This matters to some and it matters to me.  Did you know microwaves are banned in Russia because they are deemed dangerous and unhealthy."}
{"text":"3.5 stars
I really like the atmosphere here. 
Very warm and cozy.. 
coffee is well priced and flavour is delicious. 
Not to be harsh but I just wish it was open later!!! It's a great spot and I wish I could regular it more but I come from a ways away so I just wish it'd be open moreee. Very nice people work here and it's a very friendly vibe. Will return when I can!"}
{"text":"I went here for a private party about a week ago and was impressed! The beer fridge was very interesting and the atmosphere and decorations were pleasant to the eyes and mind. The americano I ordered was amazing and unfortunately, I did not try any of the treats. I shall return!"}
{"text":"Glad that I checked out F Coffee as one of the stops on my \"Indie Coffee Passport\".  Friendly staff prepared an excellent Americano and the atmosphere seemed pleasant.  Looking forward to checking out the back patio in warmer weather.  Hoped to try their allegedly great cookies, but there was very little baking to select on my late Saturday afternoon visit."}
{"text":"How can a coffee place not be open on a Sunday?  That is when I like to fully sink into my caffienne coma.  Personal preference I guess.

The coffee at F'Coffee is great - I mean they get it from the holy grail down the street, Merchants of Green Coffee (the heavens open when I say that cafe's name).

I also give bonus points for the name of F'Coffee (tee-hee!!).  I like to sit at their front  window and watch streetcars and the rest of the world go by.  I have heard that their patio out back is killah in the summer.  Looking forward to trying it out.  Will also try their food on my next visit."}
{"text":"I came in here hoping they would have good food in addition to good coffee, thankfully they have a good variety of sandwiches and other snacks, the big problem for me was that they were all more expensive than I was willing to spend. Being a fan of grilled cheese sandwiches, I ordered one (which was also the cheapest sandwich around) and it turned out to great and came with some \"house chips\". Not the most filling of meals but definitely very tasty.

My drink was a-ok, the location itself did not really stand out for me. It didn't seem to have a lot of charm or personality as some of the other favourite indie places have had for me. 

The staff didn't seem too enthusiastic about life, so that was also a minor setback for my time here.

But I do appreciate the large space and ample seating along with the large window-wall that lets in lots is light."}
{"text":"There's always time F'Coffee and food. This is a charming and modest cafe in the Leslieville area. They have on offer one dynamite combo for a cafe: grilled cheese sandwiches and beer! Grilled cheese sandwiches come available with your choice of cheese: brie, cheddar, havarti, smoked mozzarella. When they are paired with sourdough from St. John's bakery they are divine! Also a number of sandwiches on the lunch menu and they are all prepared to order and fresh. Their gazpacho soup is perfect for a summer day, it's made with fresh veggies and blended appropriately. 

Coffee menu is definitely not as diverse as Dark Horse down the street but I can attest that their brewed coffee is strong and smooth. 
Hours are limited but if you do find yourself in the area, this would be a decent spot to relax and grab a bite to eat."}
{"text":"I dont know why it is so hard to find a good breakfast bagel in old toronto/ cork town but I been steered right to Cannonball and it pretty accessible from the king or queen streetcar getting off on carrol street on either streetcare

Small cozy place,  as i said I spot for a breakfast bagel with ham, cheese and egg,  it orginal egg cheese tomato and ham is extra but its a 7 dollar bagel with everything, I think i been here 3 or 4 times since I found it and hasnt disappoited me yet. The lady from the kid has a bit of humour when calling out order ie with me, i asked for no tomatoes , she calls out breakfast bagel extra tomatoes, (it didnt have any) which is funny to joke with customer

All and all, I know where to go if I want my bagel, im in the area often."}
{"text":"Great food. Great coffee. Decent prices. And a truly fun and welcoming atmosphere. Say hi to Rob, the owner, and be sure to try the veggie chili and the breakfast bagel. They also usually have two tasty beer brews in tap!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere for doing some work at the window seats. Lovely building with gorgeous light fixtures and homey vibe. The owner is also very nice. 

Bread products are amazing. Chili is good (vegetarian only) and the breaky sandwiches looked awesome. Good quality teas. 

Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I had a HARD time getting in, literally.  That door is very unique I was kind of afraid to bust it while at the same time it was the heavy type that you need some power usage.  What can I say?  I'm weak.

It's just not my kind of hang-out location, neither for Coffee Beverage, Beer, nor Food.  I had my Cappuccino created from the Saeco Espresso Machine and it was average, I wouldn't go out of the way for this but today I kind of did because of the Indie Coffee Passport.

I guess Food is more common consumption here compared to other Indepedent Coffee Shops since it's been awhile from the time I saw a Salt&Pepper shakers on the table.

Simply not my cup of Joe.  I won't be coming back F' Coffee."}
{"text":"Have been meaning to come by for awhile...I guess the hours and being a tad west of Broadview have prevented me from making the trip.   I often end-up at Mercury or Te Aro instead.   I'm currently sipping on an iced americano with cream, which is pretty tasty.  At $3.50, it's not cheap.  

So, why 4 stars?  The Patio!  It's fabulous.  I feel like I'm in an urban getaway!  There are tons of small bistro tables, random outdoor chairs, plastic muskoka chairs and lots and lots of greenery.  There are vines growing all over the side wall and a big tree that provides tons of filtered shade.  The decor is also accentuated with random eclectic pieces like old door frames, bicycle tires and wooden stumps.     They also stream nice jazz music to add to the soothing atmosphere.  This patio is a great surprise and is serving as a great work space!"}
{"text":"So to be perfectly honest, so far this is the only place I've been to with my passport that I will not be returning to. The coffee is meh at best, they don't heat the place, and although cute atmosphere, it isn't really anything special. The Leslieville / Riverdale area is littered with great little coffee shops, don't let this place put you off the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I like the simplicity that this place offers.  It has a small menu, but each item is apparently delicious.  I usually order their veggie chili or custom made sandwhiches.

For 10$ I can get a sandwhich and esspresso and a place to surf wifi for a couple of hours.  It feels like you are at home sitting at your dining room table."}
{"text":"In the land of trendy coffee shops, this place is a true gem. While many of the other coffee shops in the neighbourhood feel like they're the \"see and be seen\" type of place this place is quaint, good, and friendly. 

The coffee tastes great, nothing spectacular but just generally good coffee, and the tea is wonderful too. They have a great back patio and play awesome music. I spent the afternoon here working and found it to be relaxing and simple. The best part was the staff was friendly and seemed to have an ongoing relationship with the patrons which doesn't seem to happen in other coffee shops in the neighbourhood where the staff are sometime too cool for school.

My only critique would be that is closes early."}
{"text":"I just walked in and ordered the breakfast bagel. They made it fresh for me so it was hot and delicious. 

Eggs, cheese, thick slices of tomato and chewy bagel for $5. I would have taken a picture but I ate it too quickly.
 
I think I've found my new favourite lunch spot."}
{"text":"I must say, I only dropped in because of the name. My dear, late Grandmother had a number of puns that she used regularly, including telling people to \"Go F'Coffee!!\" She was a fantastic lady and anything that reminds me of her, I make a point to spend a moment reflecting - and where better than a freaking' coffee shop!
I had dropped the missus off at work and took Queen East Back with the intention of using Broadview up to Danforth. But as I sat at the light this small coffee shop caught my eye so I parked a few blocks east and walked back. 
Simple place, simple counter service (\"pay whenever\"). Ordered a breakfast bagel which the man with the cellphone made and the other man - \"Rob\" as he was called by a local guy that looked liked he had nothing to do but small talk - brought to my window seat. Had a coffee as well, and tried it black for the first time in ages. I try to give new coffee shops the opportunity to be the one that weens me off cream, and F'Coffee's coffee may have done that! Really good coffee, classic coffee cups and mismatched plates. Good spot.
Free wifi too which is always an incentive, although I mostly looked out the window and yet another condo being built.
Will return."}
{"text":"I dropped by this afternoon to do some reading. Red Rocket Coffee and Dark Horse were both really packed with no seating, so I ended up here where there were plenty o'tables. 

It's a funny name for a cafe, apparently it's short for \"Time For Coffee\". 

This place has a real community-vibe, with what seemed like a lot of regulars, people stopping by while walking their dogs, and old men discussing local politics. They are also hosting some kind of Halloween shindig and have a busy bulletin board with notices of community events and organizations. It's more of a social place, but I wasn't the only one doing work. There is free wifi. If you'd rather read the paper, they get the NYTimes here, as well as Canadian papers.

Contrary to experiences other people have had, I found the staff to be pleasant and easy-going. Even when a homeless man came in later to use the washroom, the staff were respectful and didn't act like jerks. 

I had a London Fog ($4) and it came in a HUGE mug. They use Stash Teas and milk from a local farm. With a little bit of honey, it was the perfect thing on a cold, rainy day. The cookies (or F'Cookies) looked fat and yummy, but I didn't indulge this time. 

Too bad they aren't part of the Indie Coffee Passport again this year. Oh well. 

I agree that the hours are kinda lame."}
{"text":"This is a very small, quaint little cafe on the east end of Toronto that also offers a limited selection of food items 

I have had mixed feeling about the coffee itself as some days it seems to be better then others but the service is always excellent and the owner really strives to make a positive impression. It's a little limited in space however many people don't know that there is extra outdoor seating available in the back.  The hrs could be a little more convenient, they close pretty early and they are not open on Sundays.

Better suited to walk by traffic as I think they only have street parking and finding parking on Queen st can be a challenge but it's still worth popping in to grab a cup of coffee if your in the area. This place seems to draw in \"regulars\", like my Dad who come in daily to grab a quick coffee and chat a bit too.

My dad was the one who recommended it to me and did so because he prefers decaf coffee, which this place doesn't brew unless you ask so it is super fresh and a rarity for the decaf drinkers out there."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend the other day with our babies and surprisingly were able to fit our strollers in.  This place only opens until 5pm, so definitely caters to a daytime/ work anywhere crowd.  Not sure if they have free wi-fi, but there were a lot of people with laptops there.

We went closer to closing, and had their soup special (mushroom soup) with tea lattes.  It was average coffee house pricing but the teas were good and the staff were friendly.  The soup looked like it was homemade and was so delicious.  I think I may come back for lunch to see what else they had.  Atmosphere was fairly quiet and we didn't get any dirty looks from bringing our strollers in so that was a good sign and when they closed at 5pm they weren't rushing to get us or any of the other patrons out.  I've read good things about their patio, so looking forward to going there in the summer and maybe even having a drink (yes, they serve beer here)."}
{"text":"F'Coffee is weird.

It is never open (M-F daytime only), they have a lot of beer, and they seemed to want me to leave even though there were no other customers.  I thought at first that it must be a front for something, but upon closer investigation of the fridge (stocked with butter and beer... [lard vs steel anyone?] ) and the guy in the back wearing a dirty apron hovering over the sandwich machine... I really think it's just a surly coffee shop.

Let's start with the coffee.  There is no cappuccino on the menu but I asked for one anyways.  The guy didn't really even acknowledge my request, just started making it.  He broke out a big paper cup - a latte sized paper cup (they have cool cups here btw - integrated heat-shield-hand-thingy) and I was concerned.  He took a long time to make my drink, and the espresso shot looked amazing.  I believe this gentleman knows how to pull shots.  He did not tell me the total, just took my 5$ bill and handed me change, and did not say anything else.  It was weird.

Onto the rest of the menu - they have a lot of beer at f'Coffee, whish I think is strange because they are only open weekdays during the day, catering to the unemployed and work from home crowd.  They did not have a good selection of baked goods today, although the case suggests that on other days there may be more to choose from.  They have a lot of sandwiches to choose from, but again, there was no one there except me so... One last oddity: they had flyers there for Merchants of Green Coffee.  WTF?  You have flyers for a coffee shop around the corner on your counter?

Overall, I will never go here again.  Ever.  It's not like they would be open anyways.  I would rate this a 1 star because the experience was poor, and I felt foolish when I walked home past Dark Horse - that I let my curiosity get the best of me and now must suffer with this latte cup of cappuccino.  However... the coffee itself was decent, so 2 stars, but I still don't think you should go here."}
{"text":"C O F F E E   P A S S P O R T  S T O P (#5)
Drink(s): London Fog/Mocha
Food: Chocolate Chip Cookie + Small Veggie Chili w/ bagel

Atmosphere: Small cozy place with a western touch for me. (I think it's the floors) The tables are big and line up by the sides. The owner is very nice as well. Very welcoming with an invitation of small talk. I've been here 2 times already.

Verdict: The London Fog had a real nice warm flavour to it. It went absolutely fantastic with my chocolate chip cookie. I suggest you take a bite of the cookie and a sip of the London Fog. Amazing. The drink breaks down the cookie and the two just mesh together so well. It had a nice aromatic scent of earl grey. Loved it. As for the mocha, it was really good as well. Nice strong taste. Definately not watered down. 

The Veggie Chili with bagel were great! The bagel was so damn soft and crunchy. Perfectly toasted and the chili had lots of different.. well.. veggies! Again, take a bit of the bagel and some chili and it's just delightful. Healthy and cheap. The small bowl, which was the perfect size for me, was $5 with the bagel. Awesome deal."}
{"text":"Liked this spot. Friday morning and it was still quiet. Good coffee, nice service, clean and great music.. Not much for a celiac to eat but they did have some gf pre packaged treats. 
Wouldn't feel safe eating anything else. 
Enjoyed the atmosphere though"}
{"text":"F Coffee's opening hours is the shortest and most inconvenient compare to other espresso coffee shops that participate in the Indie Coffee Passport. Not only it closes on Sundays, on other days it closes early at 5 pm! 

Cappuccino with nice heart shaped latte art. The roast itself is not bad...the drink is a little heavy... 

F Coffee is one of the noisiest coffee shops I been to. With the loud music and people talking loudly so they could be heard over the loud music and the acoustic of the place all adds up to a more bar like atmosphere... And for what I saw not too many students studying or surfing the internet here... and there are seriously lack of electric power outlet here!! I could not even see one at all! 

Barista was really friendly and was so impressed to see that I almost finished with my passport... just one more to go!!"}
{"text":"Man, the music here is sweet. My soy latte wasn't so great, and you know what? I'm not going to hold that against them. When you're chilling in a sunlit café in Riverdale with Fade Into You blotting out your negative thoughts, things like that don't matter. F'Coffee's got a splendid vibe, a healthy amount of seating, a Goddamn LIQUOR licence, and lunchy foodstuffs like sandwiches, soup and chili. I spent a good chunk of time here at a wedge-shaped table watching neighbourhood whozits come and go, and you can tell this is well-loved local. I will return, mark my words, I will return.

Obligatory Title Pun: If you don't like it, F'Coff.

Menu Readability: Chalk boards EVERYWHERE.

Need to mention: The hours suck serious donkey doob.

What this place teaches me about myself: I love Mazzy Star."}
