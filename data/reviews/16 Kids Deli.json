{"text":"Today was my first day here at 16 kids deli. The food was great. I am pretty picky and the girls got it just right. Not to mention they are all very friendly. One of the workers was outside grilling, it smelled amazing. He was also very nice :). I will definitely go back again. Can't wait to try something else!"}
{"text":"A tasty, little local deli hidden in a gas station! Don't be fooled though, it's not gas-station food. The sandwiches are very good!"}
{"text":"Every time I come in here I feel at home. Everyone says hi and is extremely nice. Not to mention the food and coffee is the best in town. Love this business and recommend it to anyone and everyone"}
