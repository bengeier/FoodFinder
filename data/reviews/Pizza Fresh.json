{"text":"We were disappointed in Pizza Fresh.  We ordered two pizzas - one with garlic sauce and two toppings and one with classic pizza sauce and three toppings.  Both were loaded with toppings but the crust was tasteless and soggy - never did get cooked through or crispy.  Since the directions called for 425 degree oven, the toppings were overdone while trying to get the crust to cook.  After eating a couple of pieces each we threw the rest in the trash.  I wouldn't go back even with a \"daily deal\" coupon."}
{"text":"Great take and bake. If you like white pizza I strongly suggest trying theirs. I prefer this much more than other take and bakes I've tried.  I'm not sure about the complaints on price. Most of the cost of pizza is the ingredients and paying who made it. The point of take and bake is the convenience of making it whenever you want."}
{"text":"We've purchased take and bake pizza from here twice. Both times we got a Lighter Garden Vegetable and another large (cheese & black olive, for the kid). I have to say the Lighter Garden Vegetable pizza is delicious!  It's on a nice thin crust, creamy sauce, sun dried tomatoes, spinach, artichokes, etc! It is so good. The other pizza we got was also thin crust, delicious as well.   The crust reminds me of Zpizza, which I love, but the one at Metrocenter closed. I love having pizza without all the grease!   To those that balk at the price - look for a special. I've used Groupon Now twice. Great deal.  Friendly staff, prompt service. I really like Pizza Fresh."}
{"text":"Went due to a Groupon we bought, SORRY will never go back! We both got sick not long after we ate, ordered chopped garlic as additional item the guy put a scoop in the center of both pizzas, didn't even spread it out? I see now why the place is never busy when I drive by. Papa Murphy's MUCH BETTER!"}
{"text":"I found this take n bake gem on New Years Day and was back within a week to get another.  I really enjoyed this pizza and for the price you really can't go wrong.  Both times the pizza was delicious and both times we got %50 off our next purchase. (within 7 days of receipt)  The gentleman working there is very nice and very helpful.  He makes conversation while making your pizza and holds the door for you as you leave with your gigantic pizza.  I highly recommend Pizza Fresh if you want a take n bake pizza that tastes great and doesn't cost a lot.  Great little find hidden in the corner of the Dana Park shopping center."}
{"text":"Pretty hard to find fault with a fresh, hand-tossed pizza, topped with quality sauce, ingredients, with great selection, friendly, helpful staff (who I now have seen repeatedly and they REMEMBER me!)....and after Groupon, total spend is $12 for 2 large pizzas that I bake to my liking at home.  I keep saying even w/o the Groupon I would come here, but I think now I have done 4 Groupons...I am addicted!"}
{"text":"Horrendously overpriced. ~$13 for an xlarge 2 topping that I had to bake myself? The pizza itself was better than average, but if you don't bake on location then at least make it cheaper than going to pizza hut and having it delivered to my door, ready to eat.  I'm glad I had the experience, but I don't see where the benefit to this is, at all. It isn't more cost-effective than going to the grocery for frozen pizza, and it isn't that much better than frozen.  On the plus side, the gal at the counter that made my pizzas was very nice, but it's a shame I don't see this kind of business surviving. I probably won't return, I am pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"I love their pizza!! it is very tasty and tastes fresh. Their cinnamon bread was to die for! i will definitely come here again! there vegetables are extremely fresh and the service and outstanding. Papa Murphy's is nothing compared to pizza fresh. Prices are good compared to Papa Murphy's when Murphy's products are cheaper but more expensive to the customer while Pizza fresh has better products and cheaper prices for the customer. Absolutely terrific! They have my business for a long time!"}

{"text":"The best thing about Pizza Fresh is the value. There is almost ALWAYS a Groupon Now for Pizza Fresh so you can get a whole bunch of food for around $10. We usually get a large pizza, an order of wings, and a salad or garlic bread.  The pizza isn't as good as Papa Murphy's take n bake. I would compare their taste to those pizzas you buy from Fresh and Easy. My husband said their wings are mediocre.  And if you order the salad (which is only enough to serve 2 people) make sure they give you an extra dressing packet. Our salad was very dry.  Our favorite pizza is the garlic spinach. We tried something new last time, the veggie, and it just wasn't the same. Garlic spinach all the way!"}
{"text":"Great first experience. I called on the phone and ordered a $5 large pizza. (I got a coupon in the mail) When I arrived 30 minutes later I was told about a mix up that happened so I guess they sold my pizza to someone else. But the nice lady ended up making my daughter and I a FAMILY sized pizza AND gave us cookie dough for the inconvenience. All for $5. WONDERFUL customer service. Now my daughter and I are baking our pizza. Im sure it will be DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"tried this pizza w/a Groupon and were pretty happy with the experience. we ordered a family size meat lovers w/side salad and wings. the salad was great even though they forgot to give us the dressing. wings were cooked right as instructed on the container. the problem came with the pizza--we had a couple scares w/the flimsy wrapper & tray and we had to cook the pizza longer than instructed. next time, we may opt to cook it directly on our own pizza tray to avoid the same problem. Other than that, everything tasted great and will probably come back if I find myself out of time to cook dinner"}
{"text":"Tried the family size pepperoni and mushroom.  Fresh and delicious.  Flavorful crust.  Also had a Caesar salad.  Again, fresh but needed more than one dressing packet.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"A++ better than another nameless take and bake.. delicious crust and a variety of ingredients. Nice staff and though its farther away than another to remain nameless pizza joint its worth the drive.. very impressed!! Love it!!"}
