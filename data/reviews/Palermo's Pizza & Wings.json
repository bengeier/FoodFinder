{"text":"I was giving this place a chance and was hoping for the best since it is down the street from my home.  We ordered wings, a chicken breast salad and personal pizza.  I have never had such horrible food I mean how do you mess up a salad.  The chicken looked like someone hand pulled apart a day old dry chicken and threw on top of a wilted bed of lettuce.  The wings were super tiny almost no meat on the bones.  It is too bad because the service and the restaurant overall were great but the food not so good.  Will not be eating from here again."}
{"text":"This was the best pizza I have had in a long time in Arizona .. I am from New York and it's hard to find great pizza spot . The sauce  was just right and the dough taste like home made . The wing sauce selections was the best that I have ever experienced at any pizza place .. The wing sizes were great .. The wings was delicious .. I asked for my pizza crust to be a little crispy and they made it that way .  The decor and the staff were nice and checked on my table several time to make sure I was good  . I like to feel at home at a restaurant and I will definitely return due to the service and the food quality .  I have been to other palermos in the valley , this is the best palermos (67th Ave and Camelback : 6756 west camelback road  ) I have visited thus far . Several tv to catch all the games and full bar . The menu is extensive and more items to choose from. They have a kids menu for the kids which was great .. This is my new neighborhood spot .."}
{"text":"Can you say greasy! Wow!!!! I could have filled a red solo cup with the amount of grease on this pizza. We couldn't even stomach trying the pizza that we got from here. It very well could be awesome tasting pizza, but the grease!! We ended up throwing the pizza out and getting hotdogs instead."}
{"text":"I rarely write reviews but I had to because this was too bad.  First I walked up to the counter and asked about Happy hour special the guy said he did not know because the manager never tells them anything(?)...worse customer service ever, I cannot believe they are in business.  Food was ok nothing great at all.  Then I went to pay and another guy just swiped my debit card without giving me an itemized receipt...asked him what he charged turns out he over charged me because he did not know their own specials either...horrible.  There seems to be a big lack of communication between manager and employees.  Poor management.  I will never go back."}
{"text":"This pizza is as god as it gets. it is different from all other corporate chain pizza places. It tastes like pizza straight from italy! The slices are huggeeeeeee! the cheese they use is so much milkier than any other pizza place. the wings are to die for! they use really tangy sauce so they taste differnt as well. the establishment looks a bit dirty but its a hole in the wall and thye usually serve the best food!"}
{"text":"I love this pizza & wings come here with my brother all the tine. Fresh pizza dough made by the owner. Pizza and wing combo is the way to go."}
{"text":"This place USED to have amazing Pizza. I guess they are under new management now and the food sucks! The pizza came to to my house cold and it seemed as if they put a lot of cheese on a round semi cooked piece of bread. I've had better pizza for a better price at Dominos."}
{"text":"Never...never...never again.  It took 2 hours to get our food, even when we called twice to check on it.  My husbands pizza slice was cold and looked as though a steam roller had rolled over top of it.  His wing \"sauce\" ended up in the bottom of the bag rather than on the actual wings.  My 5 year old son had more intelligence than the delivery driver (and I'm not just saying that because it was bad service...she actually opened up her mouth and talked so I'm being serious).  When I complained to the manager, I was told to call back to complain to the owner in an hour.  It was so bad that it's actually kind of funny.  I've never written a review before but this was sooooo bad I just couldn't help myself!  Help YOURself....STAY.....AWAY!!!!"}
{"text":"Palermo's pizza reminds me of growing up many years ago in Detroit.  I haven't found pizza like this anywhere else in Glendale. I love it!"}
{"text":"They put a flyer on my door for new customers..and phone person was rude..they suck in my book.."}
{"text":"My mom had her birthday event here a couple months ago and the owner was very welcoming and friendly as well as the servers. He gave my mom a bday drink on the house which I thought was awesome! Highly recommend this place for good food and service!"}
{"text":"The worst service and food imaginable! We ordered tea and got 1 tea and 1 peach tea. The waitress never corrected the order. When the wings finally came they were soggy and cold. Further, the plates were filthy so we asked for new ones and they were filthy too! One of the staff, not sure what his job was, was dozing in a booth the entire time we were there! He had a beard that was inappropriate in a food service setting. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE! If I could give it zero stars I would!"}
{"text":"Not eating there Period...I was looking forward on eating a calzone....nothing crazy....10 dollars for calzone pure air ....and I only got like 5 pepperoni slices and 4 mushroom and like 4 or 5 jalapenos in it....horrible I opened and literally counted them. Didn't enjoy it at all. For  10 dollars not worth it.. 3 to 5 dollars maybe. The vibe there sucks on top of that.........I didn't feel welcoming at all.  If it helps it tasted ok but not worth that money....ripp off...."}
{"text":"So horrible!!! Order for delivery had to wait 45mins that was OK thought maybe they are busy... An hour passed by called \"oh we tried to call but your phone went straight to voicemail\" my phone was fine! Had to wait another 30mins.. Pizza was not cooked all the way too much cheese and salty.. Wings had no taste.. They tried to accommodate me with a liter of cola.. Don't recommend this location!!!"}
{"text":"I've been a customer of Palermo's Pizza on 67th Ave for almost as long as they have been at this location, under two different owners. The present owner has no affiliation with the family that owns the other Palermo's Pizzerias, he simply retained the name. Yesterday my son and I went to Palermo's pizza for a thin crust, light cheese personal pizza as we always order it.  Victor took our order and brought it into John who was the cook on duty.  Victor then left on a delivery. John came out to answer the phone, he glared at my son and me sitting at the bar and didn't even bother to acknowledge our existence.  When he brought the pizza out to us I could see that it was not what we ordered.  We left the pizza and drinks and paid our bill.  John did't bother to ask if anything was wrong - of course he knew why we left it. This is the third and last time he's going to give us his attitude.  John has just cost Palermo on 67 my family's business.  Apparently Chris, the new owner who knew of the two previous times John did this, would rather keep his cook than his customer's. There's a great Palermo's on 91st Ave and Thomas who'll give you whatever you ask for and do it with a smile! (http://www.palermospizza91.net/) If it's a sports bar you're looking for, there's \"The Nest\" on 95th Ave just north of Camelback. (http://www.thenestaz.com/) See you there!

{"text":"I love to come here for pizza and wings. Watch sports on TV. They just renovated as well."}
{"text":"I don't understand the other review (below). For over 10 year all the family Plaermos pizza places have been my favorite! I'm from New Jersey just outside NYC and grew up on thin New York Style pizza. I can say that of all the places I've tried this is the most authentic and delicious. The Sicillian style is also exactly as it's supposed to be.

Appetizers, salads and beers have also always been good. Alway friendly service."}
{"text":"The pizza and wings were awesome! The staff was so helpful and attentive. Great service."}
{"text":"Love the pizza and wings !!!! Been going there for years , even before  they remodeled . For good  food on game day this is ur place !!!"}
{"text":"Have ordered from Palermo's before and delivery has always been slow. Tonight delivery took 2 hours. Called after 1hr 15 minutes and was told all deliveries were out and should be there soon. So Pizza and wings rode around in a car for 45+ minutes. Everything was cold and disgusting. Called owner to complain and he wanted to give us $7 off a $45 delivery!! Will NEVER order from them again."}
{"text":"best service, great food, & just a fun environment to be around. if you're a sports fan than this place is def the place to hit up for your favorite team."}
{"text":"This place has some of the most amazing DOG FOOD or at lest that what my pizza tasted like. It was so nasty I would much rather of had a cheap frozen pizza then try and eat this crap again. The crust very dry no flavor, sauce was more like plane tomato sauce, cheese tasted very cheap almost to the point of being fake and very salty, the pepperoni was okay at very best. I highly suggest that if you want pizza to not come here if your in the mood for dog food you are at the right place."}
{"text":"I don't know why all the reviews are bad.. we had a good experience here.. yes the service was a little slow but it's cause only one guy was working because his co worker called out.. he was on top of everything and tried his best. The food was delicious and the server was really nice. I definitely recommend the pizza!"}
{"text":"First time here and unfortunately the last. Pizza was mediocre at best. They were out of certain toppings which was disappointing. The restaurant itself though was clean and well maintained with multiple tvs."}
{"text":"First time eating here and the last. Ordered a pizza for delivery got it late and cold. Wings were nothing special sauce bland. Pizza was cold and worst of all it jad hair on it. The good thing is they exchanged it but when i brought it in i got the worst attitude and the dirtiest look."}
{"text":"I don't know why I didn't read the reviews. They almost discourage you to use delivery, he said it was well over an hour and 45 min. They don't have a huge delivery area. So we agreed to pick up. Its nice inside and has a bar. We ordered medium pizzas and wings. We got home and I was very excited to try the pizza but much to my dismay I opened the box to find CANNED MUSHROOMS all over. Gross. I haven't seen canned mushrooms on a pizza...well...ever! Wings were crispy and by that I mean burned. After reading the reviews I see others had the same complaints, canned shrooms and burned wings. You are obviously reading the reviews...so just don't go."}
{"text":"Delivery took an hour to arrive pizza but was very good. Wings were very small tried teriyaki and mild so good. My new pizza spot"}
{"text":"Nasty is all I can say!  2 hours after ordering we got our pizza.  DO NOT GO HERE FOR REAL!!!! pizza nasty, cold, dry, wings tiny and not crispy.  Again don't go here.  I will drive any day for Barro's"}
{"text":"Worst service we have experienced in years. Sat down and tv so loud couldn't hear yourself think. Waited over one hour for 3 subs and never got them so we walked out. No apologies or accommodations while we waited AND the place was near empty. No professionalism."}
{"text":"I ordered a medium pepperoni and mushroom pizza for carry out. It was done on time, however, they used canned mushrooms and ruined a promising pizza. The pizza also had a salty taste, was very dry and cost $14.21, which is the most I've paid for a 2-topping medium pizza in a long time. And good luck getting any menu info on the web-site. Click on appetizers and it brings up salads. No prices are listed and no pictures of the food except cover-shots on the hone page.

I had a bad feeling about it when I placed my order and I couldn't understand the person on the phone. It sounded like they answered saying 'hello' and I had to confirm this was Palermo's Pizza. I told them what I wanted and they said 'ok bye' and then realized they hadn't got my phone number and asked for it. Then said 'ok bye' again without telling me how long it would take. So I asked 20-30 minutes? They said 'yes. ok bye.'

I figured it must have been busy. I went in to pick up my pizza and there were only 4 customers in the place with 2 visible employees. 

Its ironic that I paid extra for an added topping (mushrooms) that not only cost me more, but ruined the pizza. Whatever amount of money they are saving using canned ingredients instead of fresh, they just lost 100x fold in my future business. I'll be looking elsewhere for a true New York style pizza. This isn't it."}
{"text":"Wow just ate there with my wife and the best customer service and food we will be back."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza and wings in az, the owner is by far one of the coolest and nicest person you will ever meet, if you are looking for a good spot to eat and enjoy good sports than this is the place to be"}
{"text":"Horrible delivery service! 30 minutes late and did not even offer me any type of discount or some kind of deal for messing up my order to at least attempt to keep a customer. Way to go Palermos, whatever you do don't order delivery, my whole family is hungry and now I had to go get something else, what a waist of time"}
{"text":"This is by far, the best Palermo's Pizza you will find.  I have tried other locations and they don't come close to the quality of this location.  I was there about a week ago with some friends and tried their pizza and wings.  The pizza was thin and crispy and the toppings were delicious.  The owner was very attentive and made us feel very comfortable.  This location also has a full bar also which is a plus.  Great price for great quality pizza and wings!"}
{"text":"New bar, great new additions to the menu. I live around 67th and Buckeye and it was worth the trip."}
{"text":"Not so good!
I don't know about you, but I like my pizza with sauce and cheese pretty close to the edge and not have 3\" of crust around the whole thing. Perhaps if that sauce and cheese had tasted amazing,  then I would feel different. Alas, It is only marginally good and not worth another visit. There are many other places to choose from,  so I will."}
{"text":"Havent been here since the remodel but I  their wings. The pizza is eh. (To be fair im not a big fan of thin crust) the people are friendly the specials are great and that place has been there since I was a wee girl, and theres a reason."}
{"text":"Came with my son on a ufc fight night and had great, immediate service! The pizza was delicious, staff friendly and helpful. Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"First time back here in a long time. Had pizza and wings for take out. It was hot and tasted great. The pizza had lots of cheese and the wings had plenty of sauce. Mondays the cheese pizza is only $5.99 for a medium which looked like a large to me. We will be back to try other items."}
{"text":"Worst experience EVER! I try to support locally... I ordered 2 large 2 topping pizzas and 20 wings for about $44! The order finally arrives after 1 hour and 10 min. The driver is about to give me the wings and realized that the sauce was dripping everywhere. The bag tore too. Due to the sauce leaving the container, the wings sucked! All dried up and very little. Then the driver doesn't have a pen for me to sign. I open the pizza box, 1 of which the cheese slid right off, the other was over cook and about gave me a heart attack with all the grease. It tasted like cardboard. I called the manager and was as told to call back after 9 PM because he wasn't around. I called later that night, he just said, \"I'm sorry, the driver is new. I can give you a free pizza any time this week.\" I tell him, really!?! The pizza sucks, I dont want a free pizza. I want my money back! Of course, I was not given the money."}
{"text":"We attempted to call in an order for delivery.  Clerk was slow and put us on hold, after mentioning a 2-3 hour wait time.  We ended up driving to the store in Glendale.   Pizza was greasy, cold and putrid ;  the wings were good (if you like under-cooked food).  Overall, worst restaurant in town."}
{"text":"They put a flyer on our door so we decided to give it a try. We ordered lasagne and mild chicken wings (delivery). When i opened the door the delivery guy basically just handed me the receipt and said \"sign this\" i dont even think he said hello. As far as the food,  the lasagne had a weird taste,  almost resembled spoiled.  Not sure if thats how it always taste or it was just mine.  The chicken wings were ok but hardly had any sauce.  We wont be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Ordered at 2:20pm and just got delivery( 4:00 pm ) Cold and no call to tell me they would be past their estimated hour delivery online. So sad i was hoping to have a new pizza option. On top of that they charged a extra 1.00 for bad service over the amount that was quoted online that already included tax and a 4.00 delivery fee. So not happy with them."}
{"text":"We've ordered over the phone twice and both times our debit cards were compromised. The pizza and wings were not worth the phone calls to our credit unions. They definitely have some security issues to work though before we order from them again."}
{"text":"First I want to say that the food at this place is absolutely disgusting. Terrible quality food and unhygienic operation. Second, the owner is a hostile, rude, disgusting human being who called me horrible names that I won't repeat here because their travel bag dropped hot sauce alllllll over me and my car. When you have bad food AND bad service as these people do you have no business. I look forward to seeing their closed forever sign coming soon. Worst place you could ever eat in Phoenix, if you want better pizza, go to dominos.....or your local grocery store's freezer section."}
{"text":"This place seemed clear at first glance in the dim lighting. After being seated realized it wasn't so clean. And after placing a order we waited 55 mins for a 14\" pizza and were still waiting on our 20 wing for 15 more mins before we decided we were leaving . I was the only costumer in this restaurant.  Oh yea and the plates were greasy and had crusty food stuck on it still. Waiter argued  with me. Because I left a half drank dos xx. Honestly first bad experience and I didnt wanna pay it but I did."}
{"text":"I ordered the Meatball sandwich to go and I was never asked if I wanted a drink while I was at the bar.  That's the very first thing that they should ask when anyone steps up to the bar!!!  

But I was really confused when I was walking in because it looked like it was closed down.  So I was surprised when I pulled open the door that it wasn't locked!

But the sandwich was not too bad.  And I never walked out of a bar without spending at least $20.  I only paid for my $9 sandwich."}
{"text":"Several things on the menu were either not available or lunch only although not indicated on the menu.  Also happy hour was only on bottle beer,  not draft.  Wings were small and pizza was ok."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service, love the food. Appreciate the fact the owner is on site.  Definitely recommend! Absolutely come back.  Family oriented"}
{"text":"The server was fantastic and the special is a good deal 2 slices and drink for 4.99. Lots of Tv's for sports. The pizza is not great but not horrible either. Typical average Az pizza place. They even have Zeppoles which are hard to find. They are not the best ones I ever had. Bottom line an average place to come eat pizza and leave with a full wallet and belly."}
