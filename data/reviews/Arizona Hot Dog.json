{"text":"This has to be one of the greatest Hot Dog joint I have ever been too.  The customer service is excellent and the customization of the dogs are endless.  Excellent choice of the potato buns instead of the soggy poppy seed buns.  This place is so damn good, I eat here at least 2-3 times a week while I am at work.  A must try"}
{"text":"Although I think they're a little pricey for hot dogs, they're really good. Plenty of toppings to choose from so you can customize your dogs anyway you like them."}
{"text":"Im what you would call a hot dog connoisseur, and this place is as good as it gets! I have ate there several times now and the chicago dogs are the most authentic I have found. The chili cheese dogs and kraut dogs are always a good choice there too. They use all vienna beef products and everything is always fresh. Definitely my favorite hot dog place ."}
