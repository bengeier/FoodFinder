{"text":"This is fun, Alaskan, wood-lodge style eatery located in the same complex as the Chandler Mall.  amazingly, for being so close to the mall, you get some pretty good seafood for a really good price.  they have a full bar, compete with HH specials, though i don't recall being very impressed with the choices."}
{"text":"well, maybe it was the  time I went or what I had but I would have to give them about the same rating as I would give red lobster. I can't understand how anyone could like Red lobster if you know what good seafood is.I was born and grew up with family from Baltimore Maryland where good seafood is what the city is about.I was excited to try it as I love seafood but my food just was not good. I can't say my service was all the great either. I would not go again"}
{"text":"I am a complete fish lover.  Growing up that was my staple -- fish, all kinds of seafood, octopus, lobster, crab...I think you get the idea.  I had passed this place on the way home one night and vowed to see what it was about.  I checked out their website -- not too shabby!  Hubby and I decided to give it a go the other night.  What a disappointment.  I can't even articulate about how overcooked my food was or how meagre the service was.  I practically begged for water and silverware.  Words cannot describe how angry I felt when I left.  The food, the service, utterly disappointing.  I ordered their Cedar Plank Salmon.  The salmon was so overdone that the edges were past the point of crisp -- they were burnt.  I asked our server if I could please get one that was not quite so charred.  I swear she rolled her eyes at me.  The sides were the only highlight of that meal.  Hubby's meal was \"ok\" by his standards, but I could see a stream of resentment building in him.  It was a Thursday night, not too packed, but busy enough.  Our server was more concerned with her chatter with the other servers.  It's one thing to have friends at work, but you don't neglect the customer.  I saw that we were not the only ones who bore the brunt of her bad service.  When my plate came back, she slammed the dish down so hard that the salmon almost fell onto the table.  Surly much?  I can't give this place a good recommendation.  Their beer selection was ho hum as was their mixed drinks.  Not a place I would recommend for friends or out of towners."}
{"text":"Eh.  Service was okay, food was okay, not terrible, but not terribly impressed.  Oppressively dark (in terms of lack of lumens of light) ambiance.   Coconut shrimp appetizer was tasty enough but nothing special.  Pecan-encrusted trout entree was a little dry; accompanying green beans were fun but the potatoes were outright boring."}
{"text":"Rockfish is one of the many restaurants near the Chandler Mall.  I'd have to say it's one of the better ones in the sea of chain restaurants that is Chandler.  It has a kind of fishing lodge feel to it.  I love the Mexican Shrimp Martini for an appetizer and the Po Boy (shrimp of course) for a main meal.    I never go to Rockfish for dinner on a Friday or Saturday night.  It's packed and you have to wait FOREVER.  If you are lucky you snag a place at the bar and eat from the menu.    They have a nice outdoor area too that would be great in the wintertime.  Big fireplace"}
