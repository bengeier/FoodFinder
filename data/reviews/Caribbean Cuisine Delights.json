{"text":"Humble looking restaurant in the basement of Sheridan Mall pleasantly surprises with authentic and delicious Caribbean fare. I recommend the Roti, good portion size and very tasty."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in a food court of North York Sheridan Mall, I was here garbing lunch with coworkers.   The food here was decent! I ordered their Jerk chicken with rices and peas plus salad on the side... The food was warm, yummy, easy on the pocket, great portion size too. The chicken was cooked well and was quite tender. I also got a double on the side, mini roti filled with chickpeas; it was quite good.   The service was quick and we were in and out in no time. Over all very good experience.  To my Muslim Bro & Sis - They have a halal sign on the menu."}
{"text":"Nice place if you need to pick up some jerk chicken ASAP! Forgot to ask for some sauce so the chicken was a bit dry for me. Overall the meat was marinated perfectly! Rice and vegetable were nice. You get a very good deal for the price that you pay. I would come back again."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since they opened a very long time ago.  This is old-school traditional food from the Caribbean.  The goat is melt in your mouth luscious ... my kind of seasoning.  Dal puri ... mmmmmm.  The gentleman who i believe owns this fine place gave me a generous slice of CASSAVA and COCONUT pone.  I had half ... saving the rest for tomorrow.  I ate that and all the world's problems disappeared momentarily ... dreamy and totally luxurious flavor.  These guys are true to their cooking roots and I love them for it.  Never had a vad experience here."}
