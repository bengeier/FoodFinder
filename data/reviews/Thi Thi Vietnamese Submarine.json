{"text":"If you've never tried a Vietnamese sub before then this is the place to start. Thi Thi has 8 different varieties. Loaded with shredded carrots, cilantro, a slice of cucumber, very hot peppers, and soya sauce on toasted French bread, the sat√© chicken is my favourite.  Flavourful and filling, these subs are far better than anything you'll find at Subway or Quiznos."}
{"text":"The best Vietnamese sub in Calgary. Worth standing in line. Grab a sate beef or chicken sub, enjoy as you stroll the Bow River pathway at noon on a sunny Calgary day!  Doesn't get much better than this!"}
{"text":"This is called Le Van now and I think it's better than before. The subs are pretty good and the spring rolls and wontons are decent too.  The only thing I don't like is the often seem to be out of pate and you can't have a true vietnamese sub without it. Am I right??   Average prices and good food makes this a good choice for a quick meal in the southeast."}
{"text":"Best. Subs. Ever for meeeeeeeeee  The super beef and chicken is delicious though the beef is super spicy which I keep forgetting and then I go back and order it again every time. \"Can I help you?\" SUPER BEEF AND CHICKEN!!\"  cue heartburn of awesome. THAT's how tasty it is! They also do a sub (huge subs btw, that's what she said.  No really... that's what she is saying right meow) and bubble tea for ten dollars.  Ten dollars did you say? Ten bucks! You can't get anything for ten dollars let alone delicious bubble tea and vietnamese sub!  The service is always awesome and the freshness of the buns and vegetables are wicked wicked.  I want a sub now"}
