{"text":"The service here was really poor. Our server took thirty minutes to take our drink order and messed up our order. I would not come here."}
{"text":"We had a decent size party 8 adults and 4 kids.  We arrived at 630 and waited an hour while other smaller parties were seated ahead of us instead of them putting tables together.  We ordered drinks and app and were served pretty quickly.  We ordered our food and a couple minutes later our apps came.  They were good.  At this point it's 8pm. 15 minutes later 3 people's food come out.  5 minutes later another 3 people's food.  Another 10 minutes later and now we all have our food.  I ordered the ribs and tenders combo with broccoli casserole and mac and cheese.  I eat my sides first and cut a rib off.  I take a bite and it's hard and crunchy.  I take another bite and the same.  It's bad enough that we waited so long to get seated and served but for the main course to be inedible is inexcusable.  At this point our kids are upset because it's so late and they're hungry.  Boo on you Cheddars"}
{"text":"I went there to celebrate a birthday. Everything went well. Noticed that there must have been a lot of people celebrating birthdays as we were from the number of people who had presents and balloons. The food was good and we received excellent service. So if in the area would eat there again."}
{"text":"We go here every 2 weeks and the go to is the chicken and sweet pecan salad. IT IS HUGE AND GOOD!!!  Love the very sticky,  honey crossant that comes with it also.   This location is much better than the Charlotte/Harris Blvd one. Better service and food. The one in Charlotte tried to jip us on the salad size!!  Also be prepared to wait...a long time!! We will finally figured out around 9pm it's not so packed.  Ask for Cindy...she's on point!!"}
{"text":"My husband daughter and two grandsons ate here this evening. When the food came to the table two of the plates had the wrong sides. My daughter and I both had the 6oz steak, we ordered medium rare, both steaks were overcooked. my husband and both grandsons had burgers and they were extremely salty.  The black bean side was inedible and the mushrooms never arrived. We were there at around 5 pm when it was not busy but still had to track down the server for drink refills. We still left more than a 20% tip as the food was not the servers fault. We did let her know about the food and in my opinion, the manager should have come to the table.  We will not eat here again nor would I recommend it to my friends."}
{"text":"Today's visit is likely my 50th visit to Cheddars in Gastonia. My first visit at 2pm so few customers. Unfortunately there are few servers also. Service was mediocre at best. Quite a wait before waitress appeared, then extended wait receiving our meal. Our meals were barely warm and my chicken Dijon had slight taste of fish. Much better service during busy times."}
{"text":"We were skeptical at first because of a few bad reviews. We went anyway and we were so glad we did. The restaurant was clean the staff was friendly and attentive. Our food was delicious and came out of the kitchen quick. The salad was fresh and the chicken was moist and tender. I will definitely go back. The prices are reasonable and we enjoyed our dining experience! We tried the lemon chicken and the broccoli casserole is awesome!!!"}
{"text":"This was our last visit to this Cheddars location. My wife ordered chicken which was given to her cold; not the exterior..it was warm... but the inside was just shy of frozen. This is prolly our third or fourth bad experience here. It's not only food related which was two of the four but also the service. I do not recommend spending your hard earned money here!"}
{"text":"Perfect restaurant for Gastonia. Not too expensive and has usual American food.  Casual chain   You'll be fine if you know it's a hourly paid cook in the kitchen  I had to get up and find someone to bring me ketchup--I was forgotten. Annoying and no apology. I won't be back"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Cheddars. The place looks clean and nice. However, our server did not appear for 20 minutes. Salad dressing was good, I ordered balsamic vinaigrette. Salad greens were mediocre at best. The chicken strips had some kind of thick gooey breading on them. I think this was supposed to be crispy, but it was too thick to be crispy so it was just gooey, doughy, I don't know, just gross.  My husband's rib eye was cooked well, but it was very, very fatty, and gristly.  There must be some decent food there, the place was full with people waiting. We will not return."}
