{"text":"Risotto with chicken: chicken is good, rest of the dish had no flavor what so ever.

Lousiana BBQ ribs: dry.  Now why the hell I decided to order BBQ while in the North Pole when I'm from the Midwest is beyond me...

Service was OK.

Ambiance is very classy and upscale.  Seemed like most of the restaurants in Calgary we visited were classy/upscale but the food was WAY below PAR.  To be honest, the best food we had was at the Hotel at the airport, room service turkey and cheese sandwich.  I'm sure there are places in Calgary that have great food but holy crap, every restaurant we went to, the tab was over $100 and the food was not very good at all...."}
{"text":"This was my second time here at the Grill with the first time a stop over during a 17 Avenue jaunt in search of the best nachos. We had some apps and some drinks and went off on our excursion to find the best nachos but never did. Damn it. If you know a spot let me in on the secret.

We stopped in yesterday for brunch and my friend ordered her jambalaya without sausages and loaded with chicken. I ordered the west coast chicken club. Food did take a little bit long considering there was no one else there but my sandwich? Well worth the wait. Oh. My. God. The chicken was a knock-out. The avocado and bruyere melted in my mouth. My friend ended up with sausage in her meal and after doing her best to get through it, eventually had to send it back.

Now, most times this can be an issue. But at the Metropolitan Grill, they went above and beyond and exceeded my expectations. They not only removed the meal from the bill, but also gave us a 15% discount on top of it. The manager came over and personally apologized for it but, as a former server and bartender, I am well aware that...well it happens.

Would hit this place up again and again. Always loved the balcony and the view. It has sweet style and I look forward to hanging here at night some time. Check it out. And if you do, you have to try the west coast chicken club. It's probably one of the best sandwiches I have ever eaten. Oh yeah. I went there.

Yelp yelp and away."}
{"text":"Stopped by here on a Saturday night for a glass of wine with a friend. There weren't that many other customers in the place, so service was pretty quick - which is good since there seemed to be a lot of staff on shift.  The waitress and the bartender were nice enough and attentive, so no complaints there.  The bartender even took a glass of wine off of our bill when my friend discovered a lot of sediment in the bottom of her glass of red wine.

I don't know if I would come here for an actual meal, but this place did the job for a couple glasses of wine with fun music in the background that wasn't too loud so that we could talk."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I came here because we wanted to go dancing at a place that wasn't full of 18 year olds.  I had been to the \"Met\" before for appetizers and the food was quite good, I would definitely go back for a chill evening.  I recommend making a reservation if you plan to come for food.

The place is always buzzing.  My most recent experience was nothing but boring.  We arrived later in the evening and got in no problem.  I could feel the eyes boring into us girls as we walked in and up to the bar.  This place is full of executive-like and womanizing men.  They stand around and eye you up.  As a woman, unless you want the attention, you have to be able to put up with a lot of guys hitting on you.  When we were first ordering drinks it took forever for a bartender to even acknowledge us.  Finally we got a guy to serve us.  He didn't know how to make the shot we were asking for, so we settled for another one.  The drinks aren't cheap, almost $6 for a highball.  The second set of drinks we got another bartender, who was quite good looking.  That is one thing about the staff here, I don't think anyone isn't visually pleasing.  They know it though.

The DJ plays top 40 and they also broke out a lot of 80's.  The dance floor is full of middle aged people, trying to dance like they were 18.  Its quite entertaining actually.  We had fun dancing.  The place is quite hot, with all the bodies packed in, that's a definite downside.  As the night rolled on we stuck with the second bartender we had and he served us well.  It got draining fighting off all the guys, I can only put up with so much desperation.  You know its bad when you flash your wedding ring and they don't even flinch!  

The Met is a fun place to go, every now and then.  If you live that life style, it would feel like a second home I'm sure.  Its a place to check out, go for appetizers and drinks before the dancing starts, it might turn into a wicked night!"}
{"text":"Poor, slow service. Overpriced. Small portions, low quality food... Hoochie mama waitresses. This place is a meat market for sure. Yep. 'nuff said!"}
{"text":"I gotta hand it to the Ladies, whenever they have a ladies night, pretty much any place that has wine/booze, music, atmosphere to dress pretty, and the company of just one handsome gentleman, they're guaranteed to have a good time.

But for guys that same logic just doesn't work. We need to go to a HAPPENING place and the Met Grill didn't deliver.

Enter a night out on the town with a bunch of BJJ aficionados who decided to stroll into here after a solemn night of thanksgiving dining and discussions about political views. The ratio of men to women in this place was 20 to HALF-A-GIRL. Now I don't want to sound like a beefcake in a meat market, but seriously when you say hi to a woman, even one that was clearly with her S.O. and you're asking \"how are your guy's night coming along?\", she immediately hits you with a shield of \"I JUST REJECTED 12 CREEPS PROVE TO ME YOU AREN'T ONE\". Forget it, too much trouble to talk about the weather outside.

And really it was so bad that I doubt any attention-starved-girl would go here because she wouldn't make it to the bar without a few dudes sidling up to her. 

So we spent most of the night just circling aimlessly and people watching. I couldn't stop laughing at the sight of the dance floor and huge bleacher crowd beside it. You know, the people who have nothing else better to do than to stand and watch the people grinding on the dancefloor with a drink in their hand. Then the site of one guy relentlessly pursuing a couple of girls and afterwards scowling at the one guy who managed to spark up a conversation with them (spoiler: at the end of the night we saw the same guy sitting on the bench nursing his eye while cops surrounded the corner of 17th, hahaha)

The music was a little bit top 40's and a little bit salsa. The bar service and the drinks were...you know what? I should've taken my friend's offer to crash at his place and gotten drunker because wow, it was a human circus I couldn't digest.

The night ended with us strolling down the street, one of us kicking leaves into the air to catch up on fun, the other grumpily hailing a cab, with another burning out in his massive truck. I lagged behind, hands in my pockets thinking \"man, we should have gone for Karaoke instead\"

{"text":"First, let me give you a quick review based on several experiences here.  Then, let me tell you a story!

The Met, as us cool hip 20-somethings like to call it, is a restaurant/lounge just off 17th Avenue.  It's actually a very nice place for dinner.  We've eaten there once, which I won't go into detail on as it's part of my story.  It's got great atmosphere and the service is pretty good.  But, fair warning if you're planning on bringing a date there.  I have yet to see a server or bartender working there that wasn't really really ridiculously good-looking.  So if you have wandering eyes or low self esteem, probably best to take a date elsewhere.

At night, on Friday and Saturday, after 10PM The Met really comes alive.  It turns into a club.  A club with no cover charge, which makes it even better.  And if you're into that kind of thing, it attracts cougars - lots of 'em.  The music is usually a great mix of top 40 and classic beats.  Unfortunately, the DJs always tend to mix in techno/trance/whatever-cool-name-they-use-now, despite the fact that it almost always empties the dance floor.  Hm, maybe it's intentional to remind people to buy drinks?

So anyway, good music, good service, and not much drama (the doormen are pretty good at keeping everyone in check).  But don't be shocked if you have to wait in line for a long time, especially after 11PM.

Now, story time.

For my birthday a couple of years ago, my fiance & I decided to have dinner at The Met, as we had been there dancing countless times but never enjoyed a meal.  I was excited.  We had dinner reservations at 7 or 8 or something (I don't recall).  When we arrived, we were greeted and escorted into the private room at the side.  In hindsight, I should have suspected something when the server walked us right in without saying anything.  The private room should have been a give-away too, but by the time I realized where we were going, it was already too late.

Upon entering the private area, I was shocked to be greeted by the \"surprise\" of over 30 people.  Close friends, family (some from out of town), my best friend from 8 hours away - yeah, I was surprised.  My fiance had spent several months secretly planning this party.  And I was relieved, as I had started to get suspicious about my fiance becoming friends with several of my Facebook friends, some of whom she hadn't met.  I was getting a crazy vibe off that.  Phew, not crazy, just meticulous and awesome!

The service we received that night was awesome.  And the food was worth the choice.  That night definitely made up for any bad birthdays I had (there are a few)."}
{"text":"Don't bother. At this location, there are so many better places around.

Loud, rude staff who are more concerned with looking good and having a good time than doing their jobs well.

Also, after 10 it turns into a creepy-cougar and mid-life-crisis-divorced-guy dance club. 

I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the private rooms at the Metropolitan Grill. What kind of private rooms you ask? Well, if you're thinking that they're the kind of private rooms you might book for a small to medium sized function, you're thinking right. 

I've been to a couple of different networking/presentation type events, and the smaller room off to the right of the bar has a pretty good setup. With a large screen at the front of the room for any visuals, I've seen the room setup with rows of chairs or groups of tables. It's a nice alternative to a boardroom. There's a larger room on the left hand side as well if you need it.

With full kitchen and bar service available, the service during these events was professional and above par. Should I be in need of an event room, the Met's got my vote to check out."}
{"text":"We arrived at this restaurant and there was a menu sitting at the bottom of the stairs for people to view before deciding if it was worth the walk up.  There are the usual sections of appetizers, salads, sandwiches, and entrees.  It was a nice evening so we decided to sit on the patio.  It seemed everyone had that idea as the restaurant had very people inside, expect those hockey fans.  I also liked that the patio wasn't full either.

Our waitress seemed a little frazzled and told us it was a busy day.  She let us know there were a few dishes that were sold out and not available.  I couldn't decide between the Asian stir fry or the lobster and shrimp sandwich.  I didn't think the stir fry would be anything different than what I've had in the past so I decided on the sandwich and sweet potato fries for $20.  My friend picked the salad with grilled chicken.

Being told there was one cook, I wasn't sure how long our food would take but it wasn't too long of a wait.  My sandwich was good but didn't have as much taste as I would have preferred.  It could have used less mayo but there was chunks of lobster.  There were many fries; too many to eat by myself and they were the thin cut.

It must have been a busy day as the half of the washroom stalls ran out of toilet paper but at least they had soap and tissue! 

The location of this restaurant is great and the patio was nice, the food and service wasn't the best but decent."}
