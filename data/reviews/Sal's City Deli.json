{"text":"I was disgusted by what happened to me during a recent visit.  I ordered chicken salad without French fries on it, as I am a severe diabetic and can't eat them.  They brought it to me with fries.  The waitress did apologize and said she did tell them \"no fries.\" It's okay that a mistake was made; no one is perfect, so I nicely asked to prepare me another salad without the fries.  They brought me another salad in no time at all.  At about 1/4 way of eating the salad I started to find pieces of French fries STILL in it.  So what this means is someone stuck their hands in my salad and tried to remove all the French fries and served me the same salad.  Luckily for me I noticed them. Not only could this have a caused a serious diabetic emergency, but it was completely unacceptable.  I called the waitress over and refused to eat it or order anything else.  So, caution to consumers.  If your food is prepared incorrectly, DEMAND they make it over and not pick through your food.  Those that have health issues or allergies could experience a life threatening sudden illness."}
{"text":"Fish sandwich was huge and tasty. Love the homemade tartar sauce. Always friendly service even the to go orders."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant! The food, especially sandwiches, are really good here and at really reasonable prices. The service is phenomenal. It's intimate and the servers are very kind and personal. The owner also spends a lot of time there and talks to most everyone in the restaurant, incredibly friendly. This is a great option for anyone who is downtown Pittsburgh or heading to North Shore."}
{"text":"Good Cuban sandwich today. First time visit.  A co-worker had their burger yesterday w\potato pancakes - we will both return!"}
{"text":"I got take-out from Sal's for the first time yesterday, and I had a more overall positive experience than other reviewers.  I think that's partly because I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich, which costs about half of what the other sandwiches cost.  The young woman working the register was super friendly, the food was cooked quickly, and I liked the giant slab of pickle that's included on the side.

There aren't tons of options on the menu for people like me who don't eat beef or pork, so I probably won't venture very far afield in their menu.  For what it was, my grilled cheese and fries were perfectly fine, and I'll get take-out there again, I expect."}
{"text":"Great food here.  Sandwiches and wraps are tasty and everything is made fresh daily.  Kettle style homemade chips are great too.  The Ruben is great along with the tuna salad and buffalo chicken wraps.  Takeout is pretty quick too."}
{"text":"The food here is really good but they need to improve on their efficiency during lunch rush.  Twice we have walked in and ordered and they get really backed up.  We are going to order via web from now on for to go orders."}
{"text":"Review update time:

I tried the Pastrami and Swiss today.  While it was very good, the Reuben is definitely better.

The homemade chips were great.

While I've enjoyed most of Sal's soups(Cream soups like mushroom/celery/brocolli(?) plus their tomato soup are great) -- THEY'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT CHICKEN NOODLE.  It sucks!

I've had it twice -- separated by six months or more.  There's just no saving it.  It doesn't taste of chicken, it doesn't taste of noodle, it's just so bland. I thought initially it was just the salt level --- but that's not it.  The only thing that comes to mind is diluted vegetable onion broth. Taking one spoonful makes me want to throw the $5.00 bowl of it in the garbage.  But I didn't do that, I carefully took bite after bite trying to identify how this could be fixed.  I just don't know.

Sal: Find a new recipe for the chicken noodle soup. This one sucks!

Go to Sal's, but just don't order the chicken noodle, you've been warned! :)"}
{"text":"We were looking for something quick but good for lunch and healthy. 

Very accommodating. Seated quickly and service was on. Busy place. Ordered salads and wrap. Not bad a little small. I guess we needed to order something unhealthy to get super sized! Probably a great place for burger or traditional sandwich. Homemade chips were good filler!"}
{"text":"I've worked downtown for years, and never ventured to Sal's - mostly because I'm not a sandwich/deli person - until I was forced into a work lunch there. It wasn't a terribly busy lunch rush, so we were seated pretty quickly, which was nice. Our server was...meh. A step above \"blah.\" I'm pretty sure that she didn't even smile once. And I'm certain that she didn't even GREET us. Ya know \"Hi I'm Mary.\" She just launched right into getting drink orders. She was efficient and had everything right, so I'll give her that, but her demeanor left a lot to be desired. The food: also a \"blah.\" $9 for a \"Grilled Veggie Wrap\" along with a small pile of \"Homemade Chips.\" To me, pairing chips with a healthy option is stupid, but that's just me...  The chips were yummy, but I only ate a few because fried stuff just isn't part of my way of eating. The wrap itself - boy, did it look good! But that's where \"good\" stopped. It was bland, bland, bland, bland, bland. Did I mention that it was bland? It's supposed to have \"grilled veggies,\" which one would assume would be seasoned in some way, but they clearly were not. The hummus - I couldn't even taste it. Hummus is pretty darned distinctive with it's strong flavor profile, but I didn't taste it at all. A proper hummus with the right amount of salt and garlic would have added SO MUCH more to this wrap. The addition of feta cheese would have added some flavor, too. Lastly, $9 is steep for what I got, even for a downtown restaurant.

Moving forward, my relationship with Sal's shall remain the way it's been for years: It's at the corner where I wait for the bus.

I wouldn't recommend this place. Sorry!"}
{"text":"Typical deli food in the heart of downtown Pittsburgh. The mufallata was more bread than meat, but the Rachel sandwich was very good. House made chips aren't bad; the pricing is competitive, and the service is efficient & friendly. A good lunch spot if you have time to sit down and want to keep it light. The location is well situated in the business district."}
{"text":"Horrible. 

Stopped here to grab a sammie and it was so not worth it.  I ordered a muffaletta that was missing the advertised olive tapenade. Instead a bottle of mustard was slathered on. My other dining companion ordered a fajita chicken flatbread and they thought it was just ok. Our waitress forgot everything without a reminder...napkins, water, check...everything. We had to ask for foil for the flatbread several times. 

With that said, the location is convenient in the cultural district. Maybe stick with the basic items and you'll be good to go?"}
{"text":"I've been to Sal's twice. So take my review with a grain of salt. It was fairly new the first time I visited. I ordered the grilled cheese with fries. Pretty good lunch, but I was more impressed with the service. Friendly waitress and an attentive cook who came and visited my table. So I was pleased and decided to bring my fiancee in a few months later.

Awful experience. Ordered the lil sal burger and baked cod. We sat and conversed for around 25 minutes and began to realize people around us (who were sat ten minutes after us were beginning to get their food). I asked the waitress about our orders (since I work in the city and had to return to work soon) and she told me that the burger takes awhile and the fish isn't quick either. That statement is sad and overblown. I've had both in dozens of places in the city and never had an issue. So we waited another ten minutes and decided to ask for the check. The manager came over and gave us the same reason and asked us not to leave so he didn't have to waste food. The guilt trip ploy worked and we waited. During our wait the chef meandered on by and briefly told us that the oven temps were low and that's why the fish was slow. Eventually the manager (who was not very pleasant) brought us a to go bag. 

While the meal was covered I can't say I'll go back anytime soon.

Food was alright, much better when you are able to sit and eat it while it is warm."}
{"text":"I stopped in and I was asked if I had a reservation. I said No. Web site says no reservations. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I stopped in with some time to spare and not knowing what to expect.  I tried to ignore the sign out front that claimed it was the best deli this side of New York. Overall,  I had a great experience. 

I mentioned I was escaping a baby shower at my apartment.  They sat me and immediately gave me the space I needed. I ordered a beer which came quickly and ended up picking the Italian sub. 

Once I had my full meal,  one of the main things I appreciated was the space the waitress gave me. She even said for me to \"take my time\" a few times since I first sat. 

I love a good Italian sub and was excited to try it.  My first thought was that it looked small.  Any negativity evaporated once I tried it.  The sandwich was thick and very spicy.  Overall a great sub!  

I highly recommend stopping at Sal's of you are in town."}
{"text":"What a pleasant lunch with the fabulous Rachel C.!  The service at Sal's is top notch.  Our server today reminded me of the lady at Ritter's that calls everyone \"baby.\"  My Greek salad (- feta + Italian + chicken = not-so-Greek salad) was decent. Nothing to write home about, but the olives were plump and the chicken not pink, so there you have it.  Sal's is a great place to stop for a quick meal that doesn't feel so quick.  The prices are reasonable and the menu is diverse for a \"deli.\"  Thank you, \"Sal\" for offering a great addition to the Cultural District!"}
{"text":"This was a nice find for last Friday lunch. I will say that other \"yelp\" members led me here and it was worth the stop. 

First, I love deli's and was annoyed i had never tried this place. Put Sal's in my rotation! I went with the Cuban and it included the usual meats but the pickles and spicy brown mustard on a ciabatta bun made the sandwich a keeper. The location is great, service was like clockwork during a hour lunch and very reasonable. 

I can't wait to go back and try something else. :)"}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for Sal's, I really did.  And I was hoping the few reviews I saw were not typical.  Unfortunately, the reviews are all too accurate.  My first negative about Sal's was the fact that I had to call to find out what their hours are.  The website is all fancy smancy yet somehow, unless I missed it, the hours of operation are not included anywhere.  Not that I mind making the phone call, but if it can be avoided by adding some simple business information on your website....

I only ordered take out and did not call ahead.  They have a separate entrance for take out orders where you can see into the kitchen and watch your sandwich being made.  That was pretty cool.  I ordered a Muffaletta but asked them to go light on the olive tapenade which they did.  The sandwich itself was okay, could have used some more meat.  It came with a pickle which was a nice touch.  But for $10?  Hardly worth it.  And maybe it's just me, but I feel like the staff could be a bit friendlier.  Especially if you're a new business trying to make an impression.  

I guess I can appreciate what they're trying to do.  If what they are trying to do is create a New York Deli-type environment.  I don't know that Pittsburgh really wants or needs it, though, as I personally feel there are just way too many other better and/or cheaper options around."}
{"text":"Eating at Sal's was a long time coming.  Thank you city zoning for getting rid of the crack lighter,  brillo selling convenience store that use to occupy it's place.

I am not a sandwich girl...so why was I in a deli one might ask...? My boyfriend invited me for a lunch date and I was all too glad to oblige.  He urged me to get the beef on weck...but no instead I choose to have the hot pastrami which was served with housemade chips. The food was very good and the housemade chips were delectable. I stole most of my boyfriend fresh horseradish to put on sandwich.

Sals also services wine and beers.  Nice touch Sal.

Now I can see what all the fuss is about this deli is good, it's even better than good in the words on Tony the Tiger its greaaaaaaaaaat!"}
{"text":"It's nice to have a new place for lunch.  I've been to Sal's a few times now, and tried two different sandwiches:  the Italian and Fish Sandwich.  Both were great, and their fries were tasty.  I'll be back again and would recommend Sal's to anyone."}
{"text":"Although Sal's is a \"Deli\" i really consider it a restaurant with some deli tendencies. They have both a carry out service and a sit down restaurant.  Service through both is good. Though I prefer to sit down and order with a waitress, more often I call ahead an order for pickup, simply because of a hectic workday.

I love the southwest grilled salmon sandwich and I've heard good things about their burgers. The potato pancake reuben is also really good, but since it is more of a knife and fork type of \"sandwich\" I wouldn't want to try to manage that one via carry out.

Another bonus is that each meal comes with a side of fresh house made potato chips."}
{"text":"M and I strolled in for lunch after I discovered this place which seems to have appeared out of the blue.  It's much larger inside than I expected and also more of a traditional diner.  I was thinking seats along the walls and booths, more looking like a Subway, but normal restaurant it was. 

I can never turn away from a Cuban.  Much as I might try to order something else, I open my mouth and Cuban comes out.  I really didn't want chips though so I asked about the \"southwestern\" quinoa salad.  I love quinoa.  I think it should be a staple on every menu.  It's just so versatile, so something called \"southerwestern\" sounded like a good choice.  However, I was told it had peppers, onions, black beans... ok, southwestern enough... Italian dressing and feta.  Um what?  What southwest are you referring to?  I don't think that they even have feta in the southwest.  Still, I ordered it cause 1. I like all those ingredients, even if they don't seem to make sense together, 2. I am intrigued by things that don't seem to go together and 3. it sounds like something I would whip together at my house and call a success. 

The Cuban insides were amazing - ham, pulled pork, mustard, pickles, cheese - all done well.  The bread however - a brioche roll - was all wrong.  It was delicious, don't get me wrong, but not the appropriate carb for the meal.  The quinoa was very odd - again, not bad at all and definitely something that I could make at home.  I have no idea who thought to put those things together, but if they just named it something different I would be on board. 

All in all, a good meal, just not put together in a traditional way."}
{"text":"The French dip was really good and my pal had the Reuben and loved it. The chips are yummy. Come to Sal's. The only downfall; the junk 50's music."}
{"text":"I've walked by this place dozens of times and never went before today. After stopping in, I regret not going in sooner. I walked in, placed a take-out order and was back out the door in less than 10 minutes. While it was a little more expensive then what I'd normally want to spend on lunch, the quality of the food more than made up for it. The beef on weck was tender and juicy even before dipping the sandwich in the au jus. I especially like the touch of a horseradish spread. It really pushed the sandwich over the top for me. The housemade chips were fine. There was nothing bad about them, but nothing exceptional either. Overall, this was a great meal. I'll definitely be back again"}
{"text":"Sal's City Deli has provided me with lunch on quite a few occasions, but I just stopped inside for the first time last week.

Since I am usually giving an order to someone to place for me, I typically order a smoked turkey and swiss sandwich ($7.99), which is a good and safe choice.  On the last trip I ordered a Buffalo Chicken Wrap ($8.79), which wasn't my favorite. I found the bleu cheese to be really overpowering and too much. However, the rest of the sandwich was good.  The prices are OK considering you get a bag of chips as well.

At lunch time, this place is fast. The cook was humorously calling out orders and keeping things moving. The employees on the front end were very friendly and pleasant.

This isn't the most exciting place in the world, but it is a good place for lunch."}
{"text":"Rude staff and overpriced average food.  Been there a few times only because it's close to my office left unimpressed each time.  Today I went to the Take out section.  I stood there for 5 minutes while the clerk ignored me even though she made eye contact multiple times. Finally when she decided to honor the customers with her time, she ignored me and went to the guy who came in after me.  I left of course and will never be back. I'm surrounded by quality restaruants so this isn't a loss to me but they lost a customer.  I would not have given them any stars but the app won't allow it."}
{"text":"We stopped in to Sal's City Deli for lunch today. We've decided to slow down on eating out (saving for vaca) & then trying new places when we actually do decide to eat out. 

We've walked by Sal's many times, but for one reason or another, we never stopped in. We decided to today. Bobby ordered the cuban sandwich and replaced his complimentary homemade chips for potato pancakes (upcharge) I didn't try his sandwich, but the potato pancake was very greasy and seemed mushy. I dont know.. i've only had potato pancakes at a few places and none were overly greasy so that struck me as odd. 

I ordered the pittsburgh chicken salad. The salad was delicious! I cant express how fresh the salads greens themselves tasted! i was very pleased.

I am glad we made our way to Sal's. I'm sure we will stop back in. The menu has alot of great options."}
{"text":"The sandwich wasn't bad I should have got a Ruben but was craving an Italian sub. Here is why I have a problem. The menu stated that the sub came with house made Italian dressing. That was a complete lie it was that generic
Bright yellow garbage dressing I think it's called golden Italian it was horrible. The second strike came when I got the upgrade side of fresh cut fries. This was the real joke they were frozen fries. Clearly this place is misguided I wouldn't go again and wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"I had walked past this restaurant too many times to count and finally got a chance to try it out recently when I had down time between ushering shows at the Benedum.

Sal's has both a dine in area and take out options.  There is a separate entrance for the take out.  The inside is colorfully decorated with several Burton Moris prints and other Pittsburgh and arts related items.  Smart considering their location in the cultural district.

The menu offers more then just the typical deli.  There were quite a few \"normal\" deli selections, but they also had things like beef of wick (hot roast beef on a kimmuleck roll) and a potato pancake Ruben.  They also had several soup, appetizer and salad options.  It was a nice variety, more then you might expect from a deli.  

I started with the fried pickles.  They were tasty, but nothing to write home about.  I had thought about ordering potato pancakes but changed my mind when I ordered the potato pancake Ruben as my entree.  You had the option to have the Ruben with corned beef, chicken or turkey.  I chose turkey.  The sandwich was HUGE.   And the potato pancakes very tasty.   it came with a side of apple sauce, sour cream, pickle and house made potato chips.  The sandwich was so large I wish that I had not ordered an appetizer.  

Service was quick and attentive.  Even though almost every table was full, the server make sure water glasses were full and everything was going well with their patrons.  

Sal's also has a great selection of desserts.  I wanted to order the cannoli but they were sold out, so I got the salted Carmel brownie.  It comes with a scoop of ice cream and was very tasty.

Overall, I really enjoyed my visit to Sal's and will likely be back.  Especially with my frequent visits to the Benedum."}
{"text":"Man, do you have to get the pastrami! It is divine! Their desserts are good too. Lovely service and convenient downtown location. Recommended."}
{"text":"I liked Sal's. I think it was because of how clean it was for a lower priced city restaurant and the nice variety on the menu. 
Erica wanted to go for her birthday, and although the line was long, we were getting stink eye from some ladies, and we weren't seated in order...she didn't want to leave. This made me assume there was something special about this place!
Everyone at my table had some sort of warm sandwich- a Rachel, Chicken aioli, and grilled cheese. I had salad as there weren't a lot of gluten free choices. 
I had the beet and goat cheese salad. There were tons of walnuts and the orange balsalmic was great. My mouths was drooling over the gorgeous grilled cheese, though. It was only $5. My only suggestion to Sal is to have some more gluten free options! (Call The Yard, theu have GF grilled cheese!)"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a friend and asked the waitress her recommendation between the Cajun Chicken Sandwich and the Rachel (Reuben with Turkey) and she suggested that I get the Rachel.  I opted for the 1/2 sandwich and cup of soup combo and it was more than enough for lunch.

I got the potato soup which had lots of potatoes.  So many in fact that I couldn't finish it.  The 1/2 Rachel was filled with lots of turkey meat and the right about of slaw and thousand island dressing.  

Great place to grab a sandwich, will have to come back again and try a few others."}
{"text":"OMG that corned beef!! I had the Potato Pancake Reuben and it was ridiculous! I don't know where they get that corned beef but it was out of this world.... best corned beef sandwich I've had in my life!! YUMMMM"}
{"text":"We visited Sal's on Light Up Night.  Everything was fantastic!  We were there with a party of 7 and each of us enjoyed our meals.  My husband had the Southwestern Grilled Salmon sandwich and he couldn't stop talking about how delicious it was!  The portion size was great too.  

Another standout item was the clam chowder.  We are clam chowder fans and this was the best that we have ever had.

If you are downtown and are looking for a place to eat that is reasonably priced with excellent food, stylish, relaxed atmosphere and great service, Sal's City Deli is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Best Rueben in town! I take my ruebens seriously, i judge a place on it. If you mess up a rueben you're dead to me. The staff was great and I liked the overall feel of the establishment."}
{"text":"I have been there twice.  First visit had a corned beef and swiss.  It wasn't bad.  I saw them making Reubens and they look nice....I'll get one the next time.  Second visit had Louisiana Gumbo.  As others said this place is expensive!  The Gumbo had lots of dark meat chicken few peppers and lots of broth.  It needed Okra. I have been to New Orleans and my wife and relatives passed down Gumbo recipes and make it regularly. This Gumbo doesn't compare.  They charged $7.95 for the Gumbo.  The Corned Beef was $8.95.  I also had the potato pancakes for $2.95.  

Watch out for the step when leaving the carryout entrance."}
{"text":"Pretty good lunch place. Active but not too noisy. Staff friendly and seem happy. Menu pretty. Corned beef mmmm and price reasonable."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic. Second time I have eaten here in a week, and today is only Tuesday! Cuban sandwich is to die for. Amazingly fresh ingredients. The housemade potato chips as a side are wonderful. The only thing better then the food is the hospitality. Job well done."}
{"text":"Decided to do lunch at Sal's today.  The place was pretty packed and I was lucky to get a seat.  Once seated,  I glanced at the menu and had a hard time making up my mind what to order.  Lots of yummy sounding delicious sandwiches, hearty sounding salads and gumbo was even on the menu. I settled on the pastrami sandwich beings that it is touted to be thier \"number two best seller\" (I imagine beer is the number one).

When my sandwich came, it sported a generous serving of pastami underneath  Swiss cheese , spicy brown mustard with lettuce and tomato on grilled marble rye bread. House made chips were served as a side.  It was delicious! But what really blew me away (and how it earned five stars from me) was that while I was half way through my meal,  the chef made an entrance in the dinning area and asked each table individuality how thier meal was.  When was the last time you saw that? 

The services is fast and friendly, the decor and atmosphere is cheerful and bright, the portions are plentiful and the food is good. It's no wonder that this place is busy for lunch."}
{"text":"As a western New Yorker, my heart has longed for a good beef on weck--an incredible sandwich with beef and au jus. 
Sals is the perfect place for that and they nail my hometown food. The house made chips are a tasty side and they have a tempting cooler full of beer. 
Prices are very reasonable for the quality of the meat (no gristle in my beef. It was smooth and rich) and the size. 
Staff is INCREDIBLE. Felt like I was at a family members house."}
{"text":"Kay tends to order better than I. 

One taste of her caramelized, dewy, and salty pastrami, on weekday evening at Sal's, and I knew I had chosen hastily. 

Sucker that I often am for the word \"aioli,\" I chose the Grilled Chicken Aioli, customizing it with that Danish delight of cheeses, Havarti, which added a lardy yet sharp and lightly sweet flavor to a succulent chicken filet that could have used just a little more seasoning to embolden it. The same held true for the aioli itself, one that was slathered inside both halves of the beautifully bronzed, delicate, feathery Brioche roll that housed the sandwich. As regretful as I was, it was no bust. 

Flanking the GCA was a Red Skin Potato Salad that was creamier than an overturned dairy truck and was laced with crunchy, vibrant vegetables that added noticeable mouthfeel as well as eye-pleasing color. 

I had for dessert a Raspberry Cream Torte that was essentially a gloriously presented, tart, and buttery parfait-meets-cylindrical cheesecake that was layered with spongecake a la Junior's. 

Sal's makes me want to return, not only for the pastrami but for their Italian Hoagie as well as their Beef On Weck (I've never had it anywhere that I can recall). The next time, I won't play it so safe. I like what Sal's is trying to accomplish. I think you will also. 

P.S. We had no problems with the service that was provided by the joyful and conscientious Monique nor did we find the ordering set-up or hours confusing."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in here right before a show, like right before! We walked in and asked if we could eat in 15 minutes and the owner said no problem! 

We quickly ordered a fish sandwich with fries to split and one Coke. We paid and I put a tip on my receipt but the owner told me who he was and that I didn't need to tip him. I thought that was nice. We took a seat at the bar stools and right away the owner brought us some of their homemade chips which were amazing! Can't go wrong with homemade chips...and free!! So nice. Then we got 2 cokes, instead of the one we ordered. The owner said it was no problem. Our food came out (split already for us on two plates) with about 7 minutes to spare! We scarfed down our sandwich, and I wish I could have finished the fries and chips! 

I'll definitely be back to properly enjoy a meal. But I was so thankful to grab a quick bite before a show!"}
{"text":"So the other day I'm off to one of my favorite haunts for lunch, only to arrive to find a line out the door and to the end of the block. Kind of sucked, because they only take cash, and for once I HAD cash in my wallet, but I couldn't take the time to wait in a line that long. So I started to walk back to the office, down the same four blocks I've walked every day since October, and suddenly I saw this deli/sandwich shop that I had never noticed before. Sal's. All done up to LOOK all NYC Deli, and since the weather had turned for the better, they had an open air thing going on. I had honestly passed them by for six months. So I thought, oh what the heck, and went in to check out the menu, and maybe get a sandwich.

I walked into the 'order' counter, as opposed to the seating restaurant section, the the kitchen is right there in full view. 

I checked out the rather pricey menu, and watched as some of the items were being assembled in the kitchen. At first I thought 'Reuben', but then I saw one and didn't see the kind of meat velocity that makes a Reuben a Reuben, so I opted for the fish sandwich.

I had to ask what kind of bun the fish came on, and was told the usual 'hamburger' bun. I asked if they could give me a bun that would actually FIT a fish, and at first they just kind of blinked like they were confused, but went to the line-up of cooks and asked if they could put it on a hoagie roll.

Gasp! Rocket science in action! Putting an eight inch long fish on an eight inch long bun! What a strange and foreign concept. They agreed. So I ordered the fish. 

Do you want anything on that? Lettuce? Tomato?

Yes please.

Caching, caching...

Cheese?

Sure

Caching...

Tartar sauce?

Lots

Caching, caching...

We were now up to almost $12 for a fish sandwich.

The kitchen was run like a military operation, but instead of a general in his camos, there was Chef Boy-Ar-Dee in his spiffy white jacket with some fancy emblem on the front, and his big paper hat, barking orders. Including \"hey, that one fish goes on a hoagie bun!\"

Here it came, bagged up, along with a side of home made extra salty potato chips, and off I went to the office.

The fish was good, and thank goodness, I asked for a bun that fit. The 'lots' of tartar sauce actually was two very large cups, of which one would have been plenty, except that it was some kind of homemade tartar concoction that really wasn't very good. The big Claussen on the was nice.

All in all, it was a FTLT visit. Too pricey for a sandwich, and not spectacular enough to match the price. A lot of attempts to 'visually' create the NYC Deli atmosphere. But the right Deli atmosphere in NYC is a dive...with a mound of reasonably priced GOOD food. Turn off the neon, and crank up the meat. You'll not blind me sir, as it's my tongue doing the looking...when I'm looking for food."}
{"text":"Wow! We stumbled upon this restaurant before going to a Pirates game. This is really a one-of-a-kind restaurant. Not only is the food superior, but this is service you don't see anymore. Our server really cared about our dining experience and food. Most notably, the owner personally came to all the tables to see how everything was. He even brought out a delicious pretzel appetizer with a beer cheese sauce for us to try because we were so complementary. A very nice touch. The prices are reasonable and it was wonderful that there were options for everyone in the family. this is one restaurant we will visit again.  Thanks for such terrific service."}
{"text":"I'd passed up this place a trillion times. Never called to me. But a scheduled meeting brought me in here and I have to say, smelled good inside, so I figured we were on the right track!

I'm trying to watch my girlish figure, so I opted for the Greek Salad (when I really wanted the Pittsburgh Salad topped with FRIES!). It came loaded with all the right ingredients, especially extra green and kalamata olives. I added chicken for $2 extra and it was a hefty portion (worth the price tag!). 

Our server was incredibly friendly and I really appreciate that. It's just refreshing to get someone attentive and happy. I'm interested to see what the sandwiches taste like, so I'd come back to try out that delicious sounding reuben!"}
{"text":"Sals opened about 2 months ago and their prices were a a little high but their food was always decent. I like to support independent businesses so I ate there 2-3 times per week for lunch. 2 months after they open the raise their prices $1 on EVERYTHING! They said it was bc their dinner time business wasn't doing so well. That doesn't mean u charge ur lunch crowd more! They have tons of staff doing nothing every time I go in. Maybe u have an over staffing issue but I shouldn't pay more for an already expensive lunch! A small container or soup is now $4!!! I can get a better deal at au Bon pain! I won't be going back. If u r looking for a place for an occasional lunch sals is good but not for a place to frequent."}
{"text":"Nice little city deli but if you live downtown don't  believe the hours posted, because they close willie nillie. And that could be middle of the day or at dinner time! Sucks!"}
{"text":"Sandwiches packed with meat and nice and hot so you can tell it is fresh. All the sandwiches come with homemade crispy chips and a pickle on the side. This deli is very busy everyday and I can see why. The sandwich I had was the classic Reuben with chips. It was packed to the fullest with corned beef and sauerkraut, with the 1000 island dressing gives it the perfect kick to make it the perfect hot sandwich! I would reccomend this deli for all meals of the day!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is closed!  Which is good, because it was awful, dirty and the service was abysmal.  With that said, I have notified Yelp over a week ago and it's still showing as Open."}
