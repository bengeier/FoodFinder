{"text":"Fast, great price and friendly service.  It is always my favourite place for Hong Kong Style breakfast, their satay beef noodles is just unbeatable, really amazing beef slices.   I believe they are strongly connected with the privous Rural Restaurant (???? in Chinese, closed few years ago) I am glad they are back."}
{"text":"One of my best childhood places to go to! fast friendly servicd and food is tasty at a good price!! although the place is small, their service is super quick and food comes fast as well. Not much of a wait on busy days! must give it a try!!!"}
{"text":"Wow hidden gem. I ordered the tomato beef with instant noodles and it was great. Prices are really good. I've been to many HK cafes in the city and this one is definitely tops."}
{"text":"I try to go to HK Garden whenever I can.  My favourite go to meal here is the $3.99 or $4.99 I believe congee, fried egg noodle and congee fried donuts meal. Super cheap, and superrrr filling.  Good luck trying to get a seat here on a Saturday/Sunday morning, everybody seems to be rushing here for good cheap food on the weekends since HK Garden closes at 4pm.  Extremely friendly service, and cheap prices. Can't complain!   I do find the congee extremely bland, which I guess could be a bad or good thing depending if you're not a fan of the extra added salt that is put in congee at times. But it's not a problem, as they supply each table with the standard white pepper, salt, soy sauce etc"}
{"text":"Really great place if you are looking for quick service and cheap prices. Originally went to the food court beside but the food there is pretty shitty and the place is filthy. I personally really like this place because they serve authentic Hong Kong style food which is pretty tough to find. My favorite is the Hong Kong style milk tea and the beef brisket noodles. Like all the authentic Chinese food restaurants, cash only."}
{"text":"3.75 ha5cha for noodles and beef brisket after 14:00. Comes with soy milk too.  Super value happiness."}
{"text":"Decent food for a cheap price.  That essentially sums up most Hong Kong-style cafes and definitely applies to this place as well. I really can't say much more. Chinese food is almost always a good deal for your money compared to other cuisines. I'd come here again if I'm in the neighbourhood but probably wouldn't purposely drive more than 15 minutes just to eat here."}
{"text":"One of the better hk cafes in scarborough. It gets very busy at lunch but usually service is quick. It was my weekly lunch spot this past year and the servers are nice. There's not much oil or msg/salt in a lot of the food - and I LOVE that. The pasta dishes are pretty large in portion and they come with a drink and soup. Very respectable and cheap milk tea also - both cold and hot for about $1.  I love the tomato beef macaroni soup. Tons of diced tomato...will ALWAYS order whenever I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Overall, the place is good for its food. But for service, I give them a 2 star rating. The wait staff are rude and don't even have a smile. Definitely a place for you to get food and leave. Not a comfortable place to stay and chill. Kinda felt like they were rushing us to pay and leave. I would come back for if I need a quick bite."}
{"text":"This place is extremely cheap (which is fantastic for me). It offers the standard Hong Kong style food that I find extremely comforting and if you're looking for a cheap breakfast, this place is the place for you. It's only $4.50, I believe, for 2 eggs, ham or sausage or luncheon meat or bacon, 2 slices of toast, and macaroni in soup + a free drink.   Some items on the menu are a little hit or miss (which is why I took away a star) but, because of the cheap price, I'm willing to forgive it. Also, the interior is nice and clean, and the servers are friendly (despite not knowing much English, they are very accommodating to my friends who just pointed to the menu).   Definitely a place that I would return to for some good, cheap eats, just remember to bring cash."}
{"text":"Just ate a brisket noodle soup afternoon tea set for $3.95...you just can't go wrong. Portion was decent to the price and taste was good too! Service was quick, place is clean. Will be back. It's cheaper eating here than making food at home lol. Took away one star for the watery milk tea though!"}
{"text":"awesome breakfast I had!  HK style congee, and steamy roll, $4.99 before tax! feel warm in the cold weather."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for HK style brunch. It's a nice small little HK style brunch restaurant in the Agincourt area. As soon as you walk into the restaurant, you have a clear view of the entire place. When we arrived, the restaurant was fully packed so we had to wait a little bit. It does get occasionally quite busy here it's a popular place in the neighborhood for people to get their brunch fix. You get a complimentary Chinese newspaper when you sit down which is cool- I don't read Chinese newspaper but it's a nice perk. They have various lunch specials and combos. I ordered the steak lunch with fries and toast. Pretty good steak for under $10. Fries and toast were okay. Like any HK style brunch, you have to order the cold HK style milk tea! Staff are friendly, service is great and the food is great. Overall, a nice small hidden gem for HK style brunch in Scarborough. Will definitely be back for brunch!!"}
{"text":"clean and comfortable environment. nice and friendly service. price can be beat!!!"}
{"text":"Fast, cheap, and good.  The workers here are astoundingly fast and nice. I was seated right away and the food came in the blink of an eye. I ordered the baked ham and chicken with spaghetti with the cream of mushroom which tasted above average for its price.    Would recommend."}
{"text":"HK Style cafes have become an indispensable part of my diet. I am often overwhelmed with urges to chow down some baked rice, pork cutlet..etc And of course definitely can't forget the milk tea! The reviews for this place made it extremely appealing even though there has been less than a handful. With that in mind, I tried not to set my sights too high for this place and I was about right. This place is options galore. You can pretty much find all your favourites AND everything else under the sun. The prices are very reasonable albeit the portions are less than desirable. They have excellent English descriptions for all their items. The place is clean and... oh yeah the food is alright. Nothing here will wow you but it does the job sorta. There are definitely much better options out there especially around this area. However, if you must then try it."}
{"text":"Speed Rad: 1) $3.75 Beef Brisket noodle afternoon tea. 2) Busy, be prepared to share table. 3) Average Quality, but great value 4) HK milk tea.  Great tea taste, ok smooth, ask for more milk 5) Congee is great.  Steamed Rice roll (cheung fun) is excellent.  The bottom line here is value.  Due to price war with the food court, the price vs. quality ratio is excellent.  Markham and Richmond Hill easily charge 50% or 100% more for food than here.  This place is busy, you might be asked to share table.  Please don't be upset, it's not royal york hotel here. The restaurant is served by 2 waitresses, and they are quick and efficient, but they don't have too much time for chit chat.   Food Quality is very typical of HK style restaurant. Cream soup taste like awful as usual, pick other soup. HK milk tea is above average. Congee - excellent, better than a lot of king and queen places. Steamed Rice Roll - Made fresh in house.  Silky smooth.  Lunch rice dishes - average."}
{"text":"This place was near full capacity during lunch hours on a Friday. The parking lot was even more full. In fact the lot was so packed and there were so many people already waiting for spots I decided to park across the street.   The service at this place is lightning fast. I ordered a vermicelli with soup and satay beef which comes with buttered toast, ham and one egg for $6.25. Added iced milk tea for $0.75 more. The milk tea arrived within 30 seconds like it was premade or something. Adter a couple sips and literally within 2 minutes my lunch arrived. This is fast food to the next level. Like a super saiyan of fast foods...Yes, I made a Dragonball reference. I was in and out of this place in less than 15 minutes.   Everything tasted pretty decent and for the price its hard to complain.  Just a note: Don't wear a red polo t-shirt if you are coming here like I did. The staff wear this as their uniform so I ended up looking like a worker there myself...lol"}
{"text":"Finally got around to trying this place.  The hours open sure didn't help my cause  Pros: Lots of items to choose from Very friendly staff  Cons: Hours open are not long  I've been wanting to try this place but the biggest barrier are the hours this place is open.  They are only open until 4pm everyday and are closed all day Sunday.  If you're part of the Monday to Friday work crowd like me that makes it tough to come here at all. Sunday would be a perfect time for me to come but they are closed.  Dinner is also out of the question because of the early closure.  Having said all that, if you manage to come here, this place is great.  Opening the menu, you can see they have a variety of different items you can find at HK style cafes.  Almost everything comes with a drink and soup.  The soups here are much bigger than other HK style cafes.  We ordered the curry beef brisket and a chicken steak set meal.  Our little one had the macaroni soup with toast and a fried egg.  The beef brisket was pretty good.  I liked how it came on a separate bowl so I could choose the amount of curry in my rices.  My GF's chicken steak was pretty good too.  It comes with things like fries and a hot dog that I don';t normally order at HK style cafes, but she said they were good and that's good enough for me. The servers were very nice and they were able to make adjustments for our little ones food without any problem at all.  I like this place a lot.  I just wish their hours were a bit longer so I could come more often.  I'm basically relegated to just coming for Saturday lunches and that's it.  It will be a very good lunch though."}
{"text":"For this review I will be splitting it into sections.  Date: December 30th as of 7:30AM What I had: Steak with fries and eggs What my family had: vermicelli with spam, egg and toast.  1. Price and portion   For me, the pricing is not bad if only they served a lot more than what was presented. Compared to what's in the area, the portion is small for its price. The bowl of vermicelli is not full and it comes with one egg and 2 roasts. For my steak and fries, the steak is small and should barely be called a steak. It's beef with gravy with a handful of fries. Tight portions and is not worth the price. Instead of $6.75 for the vermicelli, it should be $5.50 at most.  2. Service  This is the worst of all sections. As soon as we sat down, the waitress attempted to guess our orders which was a little annoying cause we like to take time and look over our options. Although food comes fast and on time, the waitress is even more annoying. Whilst eating, she would stare at us and just made us uncomfortable. AS SOON as there was a clear plate, she would RUSH over and grab it. Some might see this as a blessing, but with a family, it feels like she's rushing us and made us feel super uncomfortable. I would prefer the lady to be slightly late or wait for a signal to clear plates.   3. Food  The food itself actually wasn't bad. Things were seasoned and was actually filling. The tea and Hong Kong style lemon tea was pretty good. The \"steak\" I had was properly seasoned and had a hint of rose-merry? Not bad. But of course, other options in the area is better than this restaurant. The food court itself is better.  4. Final Conclusion  This restaurant should take this as constructive criticism and work towards change. Yes, you have regulars but they won't come forever. You need something more to push people to come to your restaurant specifically. Change the staff to someone more patient and professional cause right now, your restaurant feels like a fast food place with the rush."}
{"text":"Hmmm...HK Garden. I only will order their WanNam Bridge Noodle. It has a sweet and sour taste...not quite like the Mainland China taste. It is more smooth and not as spicy as in China. But seriously this place is kind of hit or miss, the quality of the please is not the same even within a week. I wonder whether they have different chefs during the week.  Sometimes the soup bases are very light...they just feel like water. Over all I will not complain although the noodle portion is kind of small too."}
{"text":"New and clean! the breakfast is great ! and servers are friendly . the HK milk tea is up to par! this is My new go to place for HK style breakfast."}
{"text":"I quite like HK Comfort cafe food. it reallly hits the spot sometimes. and when you are with the right people, the food seems to taste 10 times better. I had a noodle there, and it did not hit the spot. But the price is cheap, and the area is clean. Like most HK cafes, they have so many items on the menu, that it's really hard to know what to pick that they are known for so it's a hit and miss. i wouldnt say no if someone wanted to come here and if im looking for hk cafe, i would not shy away from this place."}
{"text":"Price War is on at this little plaza strip! In order to survive the competition from the vendors in the food court, a new restaurant like HK Garden has to offer quality and value.  HK Garden newly renovated is clean and spacious. Friendly wait staff eager to please with a smile and recommendation.  $2.99 Special after 2 pm dine in Noodle Special that includes a soy milk drink? That is just unheard of in a sit down full service restaurant! So how's the quality. It was excellent! The portion is perfect as an afternoon tea.   The HK style milk tea that I paid 25 cents to upgrade from soy milk though was so so. Not smooth and really weak. I would not order that again.  Lunch Special for $6.45 that changes daily and All day breakfast/combo/meal set. A great solid menu selection for a HK style Cafe.  Business hour 7 am - 4 pm and closes Sundays.  HK Garden is a good place if you want some good and cheap food when you are in the neighbourhood. Please don't come here with a date unless she/he is as thrifty as you do!"}
{"text":"The food here is either decent or below average. The best part of this restaurant is its prices and quick service.   I have come here multiple times with friends. Food was okay, except for this one cream pasta dish that was super bland except for the top layer of it. Would not recommend.   The waitresses don't really speak English, so a lot of communication is through pointing at the menu and nodding your head to whatever they say.   I'd personally prefer eating at the food court."}
