{"text":"I work in the building that that houses Market Creations and don't understand any of the positive reviews.  The service, especially the grill/cafe side, is terrible.  While the staff is nice, they are rarely near the registers.

The coffee is self serve, which is fine, except the sugar packets, sleeves and lids are tucked behind the side of a soft drink cooler.   For over two weeks the cafe didn't have lids for their coffee cups that actually fit (they were for a different type of cup.

The place is now under new management.  I went their today (10/16) for a breakfast sandwich.  The cafe sent me to the buffet, the buffet sent me back to the cafe and then the cafe said they were no longer serving them.  When I asked if they were going to have them in the future, they told me they already sold out for the morning.  It was 7:45am and the place was dead.  

I've given this place a ton of chances due to the convenience, but I think I am going to walk a little further and go to the Market in the Ohio Savings and Loan building from here on out."}
{"text":"I have tried to like this place and have even had lunch sometimes but I think I have had it at this point.

1. Requested chicken sandwhich,only to find out after I got back to work, the chicken wasn't even done! Cook wouldn't cook another one because it was minutes to closing. Bad customer service!
2. Ordered a chessburger. Cut it in 1/2 and it looked like it had been pre-cooked for a little bit and then set somewhere and cooked more once it was ordered! That's just nasty. Isn't this supposed to be fresh?
3. After 9:30 in the morning. Cafe claimed they didn't have breakfast sandwhiches or bagels...only muffins. The buffet had very scarce items on it. This is supposed to be breakfast? This is supposed to make people want to come in? Preparation is very helpful. How can you not have stock for items you know customers come in for? 

That was the last time I will be visiting the little cafe or buffet for a long, long while. I know that this is probably one negative view out of many positive experiences but it's just as important as the rest!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Great place to get away and have much if you work downtown. Atmosphere is very pleasant and the food is so great."}
{"text":"How did I not know about this place? I went in after running an errand and I could not have had a better lunch! The bread was fresh and the sandwich was huge and so good. I also tried a cherry turnover and was expecting it to be stale - nope! It was also so good!! How does the subway across the street stay in business when for just a little more you can eat here? I will definitely be back. A rare gem on this side of downtown."}
{"text":"Food was cold, overpriced, and staff was awful. I work in New York and travel to Cleveland. I used to look forward to Cafe 1100s pasta, but this new place was simply not very tasty."}
{"text":"A nice spot! This is a buffet-style restaurant that has unique selections, fresh fruit, and a nice salad assortment. You can fill your plate and grab a drink for $10. This is a bit hidden so there's always plenty of seats. I like to grab a stool at the bar and watch sports center, with new age country playing in the background. Decent place for a lunch!"}
{"text":"I've been going to the small sandwich \"Café\" to get coffee ONLY after my previous issue with the food they put out.

1st Issue: They no longer keep the coffee cups on the counter, you have to ask the 1 person who works there to get one, she is usually not in the front and you have to wait for her to come out of the back to give it to you. Maybe if you made at least one of your employees stay out front to provide customer service & check people out, you wouldn't have people leaving without paying (if that's the reason for the cups going behind the counter)

2nd issue: Today I walked in @2:10, saw another customer waiting for food, I asked for a coffee cup and the lady said \"Ya'll keep walking in and we supposed to be closed\". I said I will go somewhere else, go ahead and close the door. The doors were open so it implies they are OPEN. She mumbled something under her breath and she said she would still serve me but I was not having the attitude! So I left.

3rd issue:  Hours of operation on Yelp say they are open till 2:30
There are no hours of operation on the doors or posted inside.

Who is managing this place!? Just so you know management, your employees are also talking bad about you!  
There are many business professionals that work in this building that pay a lot of $ for this \"convenience\" and the customer service and management of this place is piss poor!
The place that was there before you had a line from breakfast till after lunch, every day! That should say something!!"}
{"text":"Just like their restaurants in downtown Chicago they offer a variety of fresh and health menu items. All their flavors and seasonings were spot on. They have a separate area for grill items. I had the burger today and it was delicious! Freshly cooked potato chips too."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited when this place moved in to the 1100 building. At first Market Creations Café was pretty good, but the quality slowing went downhill. In one of my sandwiches I found a plastic gloves finger. Then they changed the menu and got rid of the sandwich I ordered so I had to switch. But whenever I called to order roast beef they were always out, until one day I called earlier to order and they had gotten rid of it completely because \"it wasn't selling\". I was hoping the resturant would be better than the café but I cant say it has been. The food is usually cold, even though it usually tastes pretty good. As a receptionist in the building I can say I would never serve this food to a client who comes in, but I go down every once in awhile to have some lunch and always end up asking myself why I even bother going back there."}
{"text":"Honestly I want to give this place five stars but there have been multiple times when I arrive a little after 7 AM and they are still closed, despite the fact that they're supposed to be open. Then they'll open at 7:15-7:30 and most of the time they don't even have everything ready. That is the only problem I have with this place, otherwise it's great. Try the wings!"}
{"text":"This is an above average lunch buffet.  The quality of the food is better than in the other two nearby buffets.  You pay by the pound and you only get one trip, so make it a good one. 

The corned beef was tough and chewy, but it tasted good.  The mashed potatoes were delicious, as were the carrots and green beans.  I'll probably be back to try some other items.

My lunch partner indicated that he was very pleased with his meal and would also like to return.  I'll join him and add more info at another time.

My lunch was $8.10 for two pieces of corned beef, mashed potatoes, and carrots mixed with green beans.

Recommend!"}
{"text":"My food would have been edible and hot; especially the fish if there were more than one cashier.  About ten customers were in front of me with one cashier and only after 10 minutes another cashier came forward but by then it was too late. Cold tilapia is not good.  Charging 25 cents for a small plastic cup for water is tacky.

This was my first and last visit.  If properly staffed lunch would have been enjoyable."}
