{"text":"I do love the Desert Steak house, but if you are going to use the same concept as fast food restaurants being that you go to the counter and order your food and get your own drinks, well then you need to lower your price. Please go back to the way you were."}
{"text":"The steaks were great quality and cooked to perfection. I had the filet with the burgundy sauce and my husband had the sirloin. The wine list had a good variety. We particularly liked the atmosphere. The restored historic building turned fine steak house and separate bar/lounge area. We can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"The bacon wrapped shrimp and steaks are great!
Service is wonderful and they want things to be perfect.....feedback is welcome and encouraged."}
{"text":"What a gem! Took our out of town guests to dinner based on recommendations from friends. We were nervous to bring guests on our first trip but our nerves quickly disappeared. Huge, classy restaurant with open kitchen was visually stunning! We had ribeye, prime rib, lamb chops and ossobuco and all our meals were prepared and plated perfectly and were delicious!! Our server, Christine was delightful and Chef Ron came out to check on us and we were happy to tell him how pleased we were. After dinner, we checked out the cool beer and pizza place on the other side of the restaurant before heading to the awesome outside patio. Huge covered patio with lounging area, cornhole, giant Connect Four game, picnic tables and the best part--dog friendly!! The patio and light poles were covered in tons of twinkling lights and really added to the relaxing atmosphere. Even after we paid our dinner tab, Christine came by to check on us and encouraged us to check out the cigar bar. 
The whole experience was great and we will definitely be back with our Peoria friends!!! Thanks to the owners for bringing the West Valley exactly what we needed--a new local hangout!"}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times in the last 3 months.  I have tried the Steakhouse which opens at 4:30 and have gone twice to the Pub area.  I have not tried the Cigar Lounge yet. My experience has been excellent all three times.  
First time at the pub I had the Philly Steak sandwich with the standard fries and it was delicious, the server was super friendly and helpful, the food came out in a normal rate of time. I brought my girlfriend back with me and we had beer with our food that time.  Our server was very friendly and helpful suggesting a beer to try.  We had Brie Bites, Mussels and a French Dip sandwich.  We loved everything we ordered.  the Brie was so yummy. The mussels big, fat and fresh in garlic butter.  The Cesar Salad I had was perfect. I'm going back with my husband and adult kids on a Friday night to just enjoy the outdoor area. 
The third time I was there we went to the Steak House section which opens at 4:30.  I called ahead and asked if we could come at 9 or 9:15 since we were going to a high school graduation.  We had a party of 12 people that showed up at 9:30.  Everyone was very friendly and helpful.  We had water and drinks very quickly.  We ordered the Mussels, Prime Rib Sliders, Artichoke Dip, Brie Crisps, Bacon Wrapped Shrimp, Mac and Cheese with shrimp added, Filet Mignon, Rib-eye, Prime Rib, T-Bone, and Baseball Steak.  We also had the Creamy Garlic Smashed Potatoes, Fresh Veggies, Sweet Potato Fries and Salad.  Everyone in our party raved and loved the meal.  The steaks were huge and thick and perfectly cooked!  I have eaten at Stockyards, Ruth Chris, Durants, and several other pricey well known steak places.  Our steak at Desert Rose Steak House was just as good if not better.  We ordered drinks that were delicious, our service was fantastic.  We can't wait to go back as a group again and eat there.  And I usually do not like to go in a group to restaurants because the service and the food quality is usually not as good.  It was so delightful and wonderful eating at Desert Rose Steakhouse.  They made us feel special and yes it was pricey but for the quality of food and service we received it was very much worth it!  I'm going back again this month.  I love having a place that is an excellent LOCALLY owned steak house so close to where I live.  I love walking downtown Glendale and frequent many of the restaurants there that are locally owned.  I now have a great steak house to add to my list.  Everyone in our party of 12 is looking forward to going back again and getting a really delicious meal.  Our left overs the next day were just as good!"}
{"text":"Went in at 11:01pm, they close at midnight,  already shut down the kitchen on a Saturday night. Pathetic."}
{"text":"Best steak I ever had, and at a reasonable price! Great place to experience for the west valley. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Awesome place!  Ate in the steakhouse, enjoyed a cigar in the cigar lounge and then sat on the patio listening to the bands outside.  The food was great!  I lived in New England over 30 years and the lobster roll was as good as any I would get there and the scallops were cooked just right.  Our waiter, James, was great, highly attentive.  The inside entertainment, Ronnie Hazelett was great in such an intimate atmosphere. We will be coming back in about two weeks and bringing friends. This may become a weekly trip."}
{"text":"When we heard this restaurant was opening in downtown Glendale we were excited for a new restaurant in our side of town. Sadly I'm worried that the restaurant may not last to a 1 year anniversary if it continues this way.  

We went on a Saturday night around 7 and were promptly seated. After maybe 10 minutes a waitress came to take our drink and appetizer order. Another  waiter then introduced himself and asked for our drink orders again. We ordered drinks, appetizers and pizza and settled in to watch people playing the backyard games on the extended patio. After 45 minutes we still didn't have our appetizer.

Finally the Gm came out to tell us that the kitchen was incredible backed up and our food wouldn't be out anytime soon. At that point we opted to leave and find another place to eat. We may come try again when this restaurant has some of their problems fixed but I don't have high expectations."}
{"text":"Dinner experience, at the steakhouse: I ordered the 16 oz ribeye, rare plus, and my wife ordered the 10 oz filet, medium rare. Steaks are served with two sides. I had the garlic mashed potatoes and zucchini, and my wife had the garlic mashed potatoes and mac and cheese. 

My wife's steak, to her initial taste was that it was pretty good. She enjoyed the mashed potatoes as did some friends we dined with, however I was not impressed with them. The garlic mashed potatoes were enjoyed by all who tried them. I will say, the zucchini was outstanding - possibly the best I've tasted.

My steak arrived medium well, and the staff was accommodating by remaking it to my specifications. I understand these things happen, and this review is not being impacted negatively by this happening. The manager also brought over two bacon wrapped shrimp, which was a very nice gesture. I'm not a big shrimp person, however, so I found the taste to be good or just ok. I gave the second one to my friend and he had about the same reaction.

My steak was not the best, and definitely not the worst ribeye I've had. It's probably one of the better ones I've had in recent years - most of the time when we eat a steak, we go to a Longhorn or Texas Roadhouse, which I certainly don't advocate or think is the greatest. The reason I mention it is because my wife enjoys the filets at those places, and judging by the quality of what I've received at these places, ribeye, would seem to be a very tough steak to find a decent cut of, over the last 5-10 years I've observed. 

So here's the difference: A 10 oz filet with two sides is $27 at Longhorn, and at Desert Rose the price is $46. The 16 oz Ribeye was $45, I believe, and is obviously somewhere in the $20-25 range at Longhorn/Texas Roadhouse/other chain steakhouse type places. The quality at Desert Rose, however, was about on par with what is served at Longhorn, for all the meals, and for the prices we payed at Desert Rose, I expect a higher ilk, such as approaching a Ruth's Chris, Fleming's or a Smith and Wollensky - a steakhouse serving prime cuts. If these were prime cuts of beef, this place is frankly being ripped off by their distributor.

I'm sorry to say, we probably won't return to the steakhouse there, because of the high price/mediocre quality. We will more than likely give the gastro pub a try, and we did enjoy their outdoor game area."}
{"text":"This place rocks.  When you first arrive the look of the place really is cool.  The service is fantastic!  Everybody is so nice.  The food was delicious.  We're about to checkout the cigar lounge but everything else has been great so far.  You have to come here!  Kristie was the friendliest waitress who recommended the bacon wrapped shrimp which was ridiculous."}
{"text":"Walking around Glendale glitters and wanted more than pizza.  Not many choices in this little commercial area.  Seems they are trying to chase two crowds with pizza on one side and steak house on the other.  Opted for the shared steak dinner and all cuts were done to our expected order, prime rib was great, petite filet was very good.  No bread, server seemed out of element trying to achieve \"dining experience\" when setting is more suited to \"pool hall\".  Bar couldn't pull off a Negroni."}
{"text":"Food is good.. But service sucks! Lots of drinks on menu they were out of. Ordered food took almost a Hr to get.  Ordered water they forgot.. Ordered a beer they forgot.. had to get on my own.. Need to improve on service."}
{"text":"Before I start off with the negative, let me just say that our waiter was great. But the food was the terrible.  Chicken was over cooked and burned. Steak not cooked to our request. The muscles were not cooked all the way. It was way over priced for quality of food. The cooking crew had a full on arguments in front of us. Every ones food at our table was so bland and had one ingredient way over barring. I recommend that you choose a different place. We will never be back to the steak side."}
{"text":"I have eaten at the pizzeria restaurant and the stakehouse. The chicken and artichoke pizza was very tasty. The waiter was very attentive to my parties needs during our stay. The second time I ate there I tried the chicken blanco. My date had the pumpkin salad. Both were very tasty. The services was again great. They even came outside when we were playing games to get us drinks. The outdoor courtyard is huge with lots of games to play. They have the whole thing covered with strong fans to help keep you cool. The whole place is a fun atmosphere. I would like to have my next party here!"}
{"text":"After another great movie experience at Harkins, we decided to try something new. So we find ourselves sharing the second day of life at the Desert Rose Steakhouse in Glendale. 

On first observation, it is a clean, minimalist environment. Lighting is soft. Smooth jazz fills the room. You have your choice of black tufted semi circle booths or square tables in the center of the room. Fortunately the TVs in the bar area are easily ignored.

The menu is interesting. For a steakhouse with such expensive entrees, the side dishes are undeniably carb heavy and well, unsophisticated. Absolutely incompatible with a healthy diet. There is one offering of unspecified vegetables.

We ordered the salmon salad and the ciappotta with pasta. They do not offer bread. There are no salt and pepper shakers on the table. I understand that this is generally intended to avoid angering the chef as though he/she  can't season food properly. But the chef's feelings aren't important to me. I like pepper. 

The salad arrived with a seasoned portion of salmon, a bed of mixed greens, a small cup of cheese and dressing. The lack of textural and flavor variety in the salad was immediately striking. My husband's meal was a brown mess of pasta, mussels, fish and shrimp. Unlike mine, his could not fill a hungry customer.

The manager came by and asked about the meals. Neither of us were delighted and he picked up on it. My sweet husband struggled to be encouraging. I felt that I was being helpful by being honest. The manager offered to supplement my salad with additional vegetables. I appreciated it. I am not sure anything could salvage the brown mess in my husband's bowl. Not even bread for the sauce? Not a single vegetable?

The issue with the ciopatta is that even though there is a variety of seafood atop the optional pasta, they all tasted kind of the same. The sauce was bland and shallow. The pasta simply an afterthought. The presentation offputting. 

Our opinion is that this restaurant wants to be \"fine dining\" (their words) but isn't sure how to get there. The menu is uninspired. The presentation weak. The scant portions, pub style sides, and lack of excitement in the fare will need to change. 

The staff was very pleasant and helpful and we do hope that they are respected enough by the powers that be that this type of honest feedback is taken into consideration when moving forward."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Had great service, wonderful food, and fantastic atmosphere.  My first time there and I will definitely be back.  They have several restaurants/bars/entertainment all in one place.  Great place!"}
{"text":"I don't even know how to start, came here Saturday night, was pretty calm inside not super busy. Some other patrons were looking upset already at the end of there meal, all of a sudden they start cursing and trying to start a fight. That just kills the mood, food was ok at best, ordered prime rib medium rare, came with a big piece of fat and was if best medium. Friend ordered rib eye, and I swear the meat had a cut like a skirt steak, vegetables were on point though. What a experience..."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch was off the chain. The omelettes were eggscellent. The menudo was really tasty and reminded of the time my mom beat the shit out of me when I ate all the menudo back in Mexico. I literally cannot type anything else because I'm stuffing my fat face and drinking a pitcher of Mimosa that was a FUCKING PENNY!"}
{"text":"Desert Rose is like a three ring circus with a steakhouse, pizza bar, and cigar bar. It is a tremendous addition to Glendale - thanks to the owners for bringing it to us. There were a few things we would change  - as one might expect in a new restaurant. The pizza bar is similar to the Yard with games to check out.  We elected to splurge for the steakhouse.  Be ready to spend more than you usually would in Glendale. We started with the bacon wrapped shrimp. Unfortunately, these were greasy due to being deep fried. This treatment also rendered the shrimp a bit mealy. Suggest the chef check out Sierra Bonita Grill to see how these should be done - or even Abuelos, both of which are better. We had steak - a 10 oz filet and a 16 oz NY strip. If you want a steak, prices start in the $40 range and go up from there. You get two sides; we elected to have a salad for a$1.00 up charge. This was good, although the blue cheese dressing was somehow watery despite big chunks of blue cheese. Steaks were good, although these were the smallest ones. Light eaters might find some of these too large. For our other side dishes we had the potatoes au gratin and the macaroni & cheese. The au gratin was very greasy due to being reheated in a ramekin. Mac & cheese very bland and flavorless. No desert for us - we each had two beers that totaled $28 for all four.  With food, we dropped $146. These prices are similar to Flemings or Arrowhead Grill, although not near in quality. You will have a much better meal at Firebirds for about $100. So, they have a long way to go to match or exceed local competition. Still, very glad to have this option in Glendale. We will be back, this time to try the bistro side. I might even have a cigar!"}
{"text":"Awesome!!! Great place to unwind after work Desert rose has awesome food and service nice place to enjoy family and friends!!"}
{"text":"I am so excited that a new fun dining experience opened up in downtown Glendale! I met my parents and had the best time at Desert Rose Steak House tonight. 

I started and ended at the bar where the bartenders were friendly and knowledgable about the liquor, wine, and beer. If you come with friends the atmosphere is lovely with great lighting, nice background music, and all for the right price. I had their house Cab and Pino and both were delicious and affordable; I can't wait to try their more expensive quality beverages. As well, all the sports games were on and of course started conversation among staff, friends, and other diners. If you end the night alone, as I did, the staff will not disappoint. This establishment was definitely started by local fun people who enjoy good company. The bartenders were a delight as well as the rest of the staff including their amazing and welcoming manager. 

The food was delicious! I had the Mac-n-cheese which definitely had that sophisticated adult flair. I ordered mine with shrimp which added that extra flavor along with the melted blend of cheeses. The sauce was not overwhelming like other places, but instead savory and almost like a scrumptious before and after taste to a lovely cooked bowl of pasta. My dad ordered a veggie pizza which is great for anyone looking for a fresh cooked pie! Everyone knows a good pie has the best crush and this dough will not let you down: crisp on the outside but warm and soft on the inside. My mom ordered a seafood dish that filled all three of our tummies, and still made us wish we had more. The sauce was just right, the bread was great for dipping, and the seafood was cooked to perfection. She did not order it with pasta, and honestly I wouldn't have it any other way (especially if you are trying to watch your calorie intake). The dish was so flavorful and exciting! Across the board this menu is new, fun, and delectable; 5 stars for taste and delivery!

I cannot wait to come back to Desert Rose if not for the great food, drinks and price, then for the company and staff!"}
{"text":"We thoroughly enjoyed dinner at this new place in Glendale! It's walking distance from the Old Town area and a must for anyone that loves quality food and service.  The attention we got was perfect - not too much or too little.  No one walking around every 3 minutes asking how you're doing and interrupting your meal and conversation, but just the right amount to ensure nothing falls through the cracks.

The food was top notch.  I had a filet and it was perfect.  My wife had the Mac 'n Cheese with poblano peppers and loved it. Desert - Tiramisu - was apparently homemade and outstanding, as well."}
{"text":"Laura was great. Provided insight on the menu and was very helpful with all of our questions since they just opened in our neighborhood. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"What a great surprise!  We stayed at the Gaslight Inn and ordered take out to watch the Oscars in our room and I was so bummed we didn't done in!  We have the \"Big Fat Cheeseburger\", which definitely lived up to its name, and the Pumpkin Spinach and Feta salad - SO GOOD and totally reasonable, which made the food a major value!  Great steak fries, burger was really tasty and cooked to perfection and the salad was the best we had on our whole trip.  We had trouble finding decent food in Glendale and this place saved the day. I just wish we had dined in because the dining room was really nice - warm and modern.  The server was super nicer do helpful - took the time to give me a quick tour of the whole place, including the gastropub next door, which looked like just a great place to hang out and have a drink and great food.  They had a giant Jenga game, shuffleboard and a bunch of other fun games.  I highly, HIGHLY recommend eating here - we will for sure the next time we're in town."}
{"text":"Just had the brunch special and the omelette not only hit the spot but the toppings were very fresh and tasty. Service is great and I can see this place being a go to spot in Glendale , AZ"}
{"text":"Our group made arrangements to have dinner on a Wednesday evening. My partner and I ordered our meal before 7:00. At 8:20 I asked one of the two wait staff to box our meals to go as we couldn't wait any longer for our food. Additionally, we never got our water glasses refilled. The bill came without the promised $10 discount on the prime rib special (it was corrected) and it came with a 20% tip already built into the total. I will never be back."}
{"text":"This place is very pricey for the service you receive. When you first walk in the customer service is lousy. Unfortunately the gal that stands at the door has never learned any customer service skills. She did not greet us and say welcome into the restaurant and her explanation of how the place works was not great at all. That steaks are so over priced! A shared meal for 2 is $80! Really? I had the Salmon seared salad with the sun-dried tomato vinaigrette. I'm not going to say that it wasn't tasty but they went very sparing on the lettuce. My husband enjoyed his prime rib French dip and his french fries were good as well. The decor is all over the place. I didn't know if I was in a bar or sports bar or lounge or some Industrial Place. There's just too much going on. They don't have waitresses. Not normal. It felt as if I was at Sonic drive-thru to me. You should not have to walk up to a cashier to order in a place that sells expensive steaks."}
{"text":"Wow. To see the reviews from this restaurant as anything less than phenomenal is surprising. Our party arrived early for our reservations but we were still seated and served immediately. The waiters, waitresses and even the manager were great to us. My husband received a free birthday dessert and the food was also good:) the best part was the concern the staff showed for my husband when he started choking and literally needed the Heimlich (it's only funny because he's ok and we have dark humor) They all made us feel very comfortable and the manager even sat and spoke with us for awhile to ensure my husband was ok. We all had a good laugh after and even stayed the rest of the night for drinks. This place has a great outdoor area with giant jenga, corn hole, ping pong and more (I think that part is considered the gastropub, but they are essentially connected to the steakhouse) Anyways, we had a fantastic formal dinner then partied all night after. Great fun!"}
{"text":"I was beyond happy to hear about a new cool place coming to Old Town Glendale. However, my experiences have been extremely disappointing. 

Before I get into a story about my experience, let me say this. Desert Rose needs a real manager. Whoever is doing it now has no idea what they are doing. Please, for the love of god, get a good manager; it might save this place from going under.

So, my latest bad experience. I showed up one night with a couple friends and asked if the outside seating was available. I was told it was and the hostess sat us. Time goes by. And more time goes by. Then even more time goes by. Now, I am getting more thirsty, hungry, and annoyed. But! Light at the end of the tunnel! I recognize one of the bartenders from my time hanging out in their cigar lounge. I approached her and asked who the server was for my table and she told me that the hostess wasnt supposed to seat anyone there because they didnt have a server for those tables yet. I guess they had planned to put reserved signs on the tables, but no one did it and no one told the hostess. Genius. But, the bartender stepped up, even though she was slammed, and took our orders. I ordered a steak, well done. Probably an hour and a half later, it arrives. It was rare and cold. The potatoes were cold, the broccoli was cold, the only thing that wasnt cold was the beer i was sipping while waiting for my food to arrive. Did I mention the hostess had given me plastic silverware. Have you tried cutting a steak with a little plastic knife? I'm just glad the steak wasnt hot or it would have melted my fork."}
{"text":"Had an 11:30 reservation for Mother's Day. Arrived at the steakhouse to check-in with the hostess and was told to check-in with the hostess on the pizza/patio side. Waited 10 minutes to check-in with only two people ahead of us as the hostess was in no hurry to deal with customers. Finally the hostess from the steakhouse side came over, checked us in and led us thru a crowded maze to our booth. Seated and another 15 minutes passes, no server or drinks. Hostess returns and wants to know if we'd seen our server yet. Big no there so she runs off to get our waters while the people in the booth next to us tell her their server had been to their table 3 times and they still did not have any drinks. While we waited for our waters we saw 3 other tables of customers get up and leave without ever being waited on. Also saw a fight break out when customers from the table across from us went to the buffet and returned to find the hostess gave their table to another group.
Then the buffet line ~ it was huge I'm talking Disneyland on a holiday weekend long. One employee making waffles, two making omelets which really slowed the line down. We finally made it back to our table with our food at 12:50 pm, an hour and 20 minutes after we arrived. I thought this was the first time they had attempted a Mother's Day brunch and the server said no they do this every year. Management needs to retake some planning and logistics courses if they think this is acceptable. The server once we finally met her was running her ass off to take care of all of her tables. We tipped the young lady 30% as none of this was her fault but I'm sure some of the customers probably did think that way and stiffed her on the tip. Management is a joke and although the food was very good, we'll never venture to this establishment again."}
{"text":"OK I would of gave this place three stars. but they just opened the server was grate but the kitchen  was so slow no bread the steak was grate  very  flavorfull side options were good mac and cheese was just OK the only weird thing that I thought was they give you a1 before the steak come out its not Denny's but will be back for anther try"}
{"text":"This place has an identity crisis. The food is decent, so let's start with that. Some great cocktails on the menu as well. But they were sharing bartenders with the pub outside. So don't let the fact that they are marketed as two separate businesses fool you. It took awhile to get drinks; our servers had to be flagged down; and we had to serve ourselves water. As for the outside - totally different. It used to be a place that was seamless - the pub to the steakhouse and back was completely comfortable for all ages and groups. But now - the pub does not have servers, people order at the counter, and they have signs up prohibiting gang signs and colors. When did it turn into that kind of place that we have to worry about that? Won't be back. Posted for the pub as well."}
{"text":"Not a place I will return to. It was a busy night but not so busy that our order hadn't been started after an hour. After several attempts with the waiter to get the truth we were finally informed that our meal was still in the queue to be cooked and one was a salad. The truth would have saved us a little time. I couldn't tell you if the food is good because we finally left. I wouldn't recommend this place at all, especially for the price of their food."}
{"text":"OMG!  This place is amazing!  Met Tori the new manager for the first time this weekend and she made sure we had a surreal experience.  She checked on us often and made sure we were doing well.  

Their food was yummy.  Especially the prime rib!  Is it wrong to gnaw on the bone in the restaurant?  :)

Can't wait to go back for the food and excellent service!"}
{"text":"I cant believe I have not been here sooner.  This is a great place.   I ordered the T-bone.  it was so good.  It was topped with a deliciouse butter sauce.  Cooked to perfection.  Comes with two sides.  I ordered the house salad and twice baked potatoe.  The salad was good topped with mozerella.  The twiced baked potatoe not so much.  It waa very dry had to put bluecheese dressing all over it.   my friend had the chocolate cake for desert and she said it was the best she ever had.   She had the lamb chops.  She said they were fantastic.   They give you fresh focaccia bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar to dip it in. Very good  We were there on a night they had  open mic.  All the  singers we 're very good.   If you want good food good servers defiently go here.  I will be back"}
{"text":"I'm going to start by saying I'm extremely disappointed. Worst service I've had in a long time, and as of now I would not recommend this place to friends, family, or anyone. The first time I came here I would have rated it 5 stars, but my last experience was by far a 1 star visit - I'm only giving 2 stars because Richard, the manager on duty provided decent Service and the food we did get was for the most part not bad. 
After the first good experience, I decided to come back for a second time, this time to celebrate my birthday, and also to show my wife's parents a new place. 
First, the initial service was not impressive. It took more than 15 minutes just to get our drinks, after which the server walked away without taking our orders. 5 minutes later she returned, took our orders and left. We didn't see her again, no drink refills, no nothing, for the next hour it took to get our food. 
Finally, the food did arrive, only not including my dish. The server said she would be right back, and did not even come back to acknowledge that the dish was delayed for more than 25 minutes, by which point the rest of my family was well into their meal. After an additional 10 minutes they finally brought out the dish, by which point, I just asked for a box - so much for my birthday dinner. 
I fully enjoy supporting local restaurants, and it pains me to write a bad review about one. I may eventually give this place a second shot, and will update my review if I do and it's better, but as of right now, I'd say you're far better off finding a better place to eat."}
{"text":"Been here twice. Once when the place first opened. Gave them a pass on two hour wait for food, having to ask up to 4 times for drinks, and eventually going to bar for our own drinks. Also, food was cold. They comped a lot of it due to our complaining, so that was cool. As I said though, gave them a pass because they were new. Fast forward six weeks. Went to try again thinking they maybe got it together. Ordered thai chili wings and they bring out wings with sauce on the side. It was literally spicy bbq sauce. Asked for another because we figured it was a mix up. Nope. That is their version of thai chili. Meaty wings though. After two visits, they definitely need a new chef and better operational procedures for serving and delivering food. Also, place is very over-priced for the west side. At their prices, you would assume the food would be specialty. Also, having a pub side would assume you have pub menu and relative prices. Not the case. The reason for two stars is the ambiance. Great place to hang. It's evident that their prices are to make up for how much it probably cost to put the place together. I would avoid this place for dinner, but because I like the setup, I would go for drinks. The two stars is solely based on the venue, and nothing else."}
{"text":"Going to a new restaurant on opening night is always a risk. Other than not having all the beers listed on their drink menu Desert Rose nailed it!! Food is great, pork chops and prime rib were really good. It's a big spacious room with a small bar in the back. 

Next up they will have a gastro pub with patio and cigar lounge. Down the road a music venue. 

It's in an old building just south of downtown Glendale.  Same owners as the Gaslight historic hotel and wine bar. 

It was worth the risk!!!"}
{"text":"Tried the Steakhouse and my wife and I both really enjoyed it.   We both ordered the osso buco which is a leg of lamb over creamy mashed potatoes and carrots.....fall off the bone.......much better than I thought it was going to be...........we will be back again for sure.   They also have 2 other buildings......a pizza gastropub and a cigar place......also have a place outside for concerts although I've only been to the Steakhouse once but I give it 5 stars........clam chowder was good, will try the onion soup next time......side salad was average.......also noticed they have brunch."}
{"text":"We had a party of 8 and sat in the bar area. The service was excellent, and our glasses were never empty. We ordered 3 different pizzas and everyone thought they were excellent. I highly recommend for a fun family evening."}
{"text":"Amazing Bone in ribeye and garlic mashed potatoes. Fish and chips were good, pretty good burger. The Mac and Cheese was not good at all. They need a new recipe. Service was good. They tried really hard but you could tell they are new. The atmosphere was awesome! I have high hopes this place turns in to a great spot for locals."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! I was impressed with our waitress and her knowledge of the dishes. Christine did her best to get our drinks right away, but the wait staff failed miserably by not bringing our table bread service until she said something!  We ordered cocktails from the bar and I was SO APPALLED at the $12 price for a very small margarita! Not top shelf, not special, not a Cadillac at all! Just a small drink!!!! The mixed drinks are only $7! What's up with that??? They call it a \"SPECIAL DRINK!\" It's a special price all right! You'd have gotten more stars if your price was reasonable for the size. A 10oz margarita does not constitute a $12 price tag! You're blowing it there!  

We had the 16oz ribeye, PERFECTION! Lobster Mac n cheese ok, not enough chunks of lobster, they get lost in the sauce. Seared scallops were also perfection! I enjoyed the white asparagus. Lobster roll amazing! The dill aoli was a nice touch. 

Get your drink prices in line and you've got a winning place!"}
{"text":"Desert Rose is a gem in downtown Glendale.  The vibe in this place is fantastic.  We have visited several times and have been completely satisfied with food and great service.  Our waiter, Nick, was exceptional in customer service.  Friendly, professional, caring staff who are very attentive.  On each visit, we have enjoyed quality dishes prepared perfectly.  Appetizers are to die for.  You can sit inside, outside on the spacious patio, or visit the cigar bar.  There is plenty to do for any age with activities throughout the huge outdoor area.  A must visit."}
{"text":"Nice little place .. open mic.. prime rib.. great service.  Definite must try!!  Loved the outdoor space too."}
{"text":"Best place in Old Town Glendale for Sunday brunch. Prime rib cooked to order omelettes. Great staff."}
{"text":"Went there at 4:30pm on a Tuesday. Was greeted and asked how many and my name which I gave my last name. Then she asked for my first name also which I gave. We were seated and given menus. A waiter came over and asked if we'd like some water and we said yes please. Started reviewing the menu and I was ready to order appetizers and a few items at their prices would have been close to $100 just for me (yeah this place isn't cheap so I figured they should be as good as Arrowhead Grill, Morton's, Ruth Chris, Don Shula's, I think you get the point. (I've dined at all these plus more high end joints. )  The waiter came over and said we're not serving food from the restaurant right now would we like something from the bar. I asked if the bar had a menu and they weren't serving any bar food either. Needless to say I won't waste my time going back to a place that call themselves a steakhouse with hours posted saying that they open at 11 am.
Considering their location and lack of parking plus a poor showing, I believe they can kiss their supposed $5 Million investment to be flushed down the toilet running a business like this."}
{"text":"I struggled with even starting this review. I went back and forth in my head wondering if I can adequately rate this place. After much thought I decided yep, I can. The reason for my teetering was because we didn't eat here. Now the reason I will rate this is because we planned on it! 

Went here on Valentine's Day; we were told \"we're booked\" so we made our way to the bar. I laughed because the open layout of the restaurant made it clear, it was far from booked. We were told everyone would be arriving shortly..... Honestly this was no big deal to us. 

So here we are at the bar. The bar tender says I'll be right with you as we sat at a small table. We confirmed it was part of the bar service as we sat down. Then we waited and waited and waited. Easily 20 minutes! It was clear the bartender was overwhelmed, but the place was not even close to busy. 

As we sat there she served a couple who sat at the bar way after we arrived. To help her out we moved up to the bar. I ordered a beer that had to be retrieved from \"our other bar\" creating another delay. The wife ordered a drink which was made from scratch and tasty. 

Now after 20-30 minutes I scanned the menu with a desire to have a quality steak. However, as I sat there I felt like I couldn't justify forking over my hard earned cash with the experience I had up to this point. We even picked out what we wanted to eat and talked back and forth about ordering or leaving for another 15-20 minutes. Eventually we decided to leave. 

I give this place two stars for the hope my experience was the result of a brand new restaurant ironing out the details. Rest assured I will be back, please don't let me down. I am tired of driving to downtown Phoenix for places that have achieved the potential this place has. 

One last thing, there were open tables in the restaurant the entire time. Not one or two but many."}
{"text":"I went last night for the live jazz.  Although the music was great their food was good but their advertising was false.  They have a flyer that promotes specials on food and even when I showed their flyer to the waitress and manager they flat out lied and said they didn't have any specials.  It was not about the money but the principle.  You're looking at your promo, in writing and deny it."}
{"text":"Pizza is good but survive really sucks. Pizza came out way after my pizza and the wait for a beer is like pooling teeth. Looks as if no dressing was on it. Before the salad came out I told the bar tender to just cancel the salad. She said it's already on their?? What I was thinking. I can't cancel an order that never came out."}
{"text":"We started with Prime Rib sliders way over cooked and the prime rid meat was all shredded. The Salmon was way over cooked. Their lobster roll was more chucks of celery than anything on a big sub roll. The service was ok. The advertising for this place was not what I expected. Off to the side was a big wall of windows and a door going into a sports bar."}
{"text":"WOW!We were looking for a local spot to celebrate my Mom's birthday. We went on a Thursday evening. They weren't busy and our server was VERY attentive. The hubs and I shared a 16oz ribeye. Mom had the prime rib salad, which was on special. We brought our own cake, which the kitchen cut and brought out at the end of the meal. This was such a delicious meal! All 5 in our party were impressed and will return (hopefully) soon. Bottom line: EAT HERE!"}
{"text":"First timer and will be back.   Greeted by a high energy hostess; who we saw assisting servers to be sure guests received exceptional service.   Nice restaurant with seating for intimate dinners to large parties.  Tastefully decorated for the holiday.  

Menu is vast, something for everyone.  Our server was Justin who was friendly, attentive and overall excellent server.  He kept my water filled like clock work (poor guy, I drink a lot of water).  We received a nice warm basket of lavash (wonderful)  We both ordered the classic sirloin with loaded bake potato and salads.   Our steaks were cooked perfectly and seasoned well, potato jumbo size.   They have a lot of side options to choose, including homemade Mac& cheese. We stuck with the basics.    Excellent food, great service and nice ambiance.   The busers are engaged, in fact all the employees work together to be sure guests are treated right and enjoy their meal. 

They have a sister restaurant next door pizza and burgers, it was hopping with lots of fun things to do both inside and out.   We will be back.  

Bonus is that it is in walking distance to Glendale Glitters, so you can take a nice stroll and enjoy the beautiful lights."}
{"text":"Every night that I drove by this place, I was excited that Old Town Glendale finally had added another really cool hip place to grab a bite. That being said, when we booked our reservations on a Sunday night, the first party arrived on time, just to be told that our reservations had been canceled because we were late, in an otherwise empty restaurant. After we were sat down, we had an ok waiter, but he seemed very quiet and stuck to the basics, no offers on Specials, drinks, or other cool stuff since this was our first time there. If I am going to pay over $100 for two adults, I expect the waiter to be friendly, naturally outgoing, and somewhat excited. He definitely wasn't. I ordered the braised lamb, and it tasted overly gamey, and tough to eat and the sides were just ok. My advice would be to spend your $100 at another place that is excited to serve you! My experience will more than likely keep me away from going again. Such a shame as I love Glendale and was hoping this restaurant would be a great addition to a growing set of hip new places to check out. It wasn't."}
{"text":"I will give this place a 4 star because the female manager is rude. All the servers were great!!! The service was a bit slow but they were low on staff. The food and drinks were amazing!!! Other than that I love it. I was out of town so this was my first time her to check it out. The manager was speaking to another customer about seating and yell at an employee in front of everyone outside. Very unprofessional if you ask me. We actually thought abut going somewhere else while seeing this. But we said no. I was happy we did not because the servers and bartender made it great!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the NY strip medium.  They brought it out completely raw!!! I sent it back...They brought it back to me on the same plate, same meat, same sides, they did not replace anything and called it good.  We were warned, but decided to try anyway...You are better off going to the chain steakhouses, at least they know the difference between medium and rare!!   Complete abomination of a steakhouse."}
{"text":"They still get high marks for the food.  On the pizza/gastropub side,  they no longer have table service,  although that continues in the steakhouse. 

So, you go to the bar and place your order with the bartender. In my case , which was late afternoon,  this gave me the opportunity to be ignored by a different set of people. To be fair, there is no cashier this early,  and the bartenders were distracted. The bartender told me they have one in the evening. 

Not sure this is solution to their service issues,  but I hope out works better than I would guess."}
{"text":"Checking out the menu online, before I arrived, I notice happy hour pricing on the menu: 

Happy Hour
3-6:30pm
Mon.-Thurs.
$2 off all well drinks
$2 off a draughts
$2 off all appetizers
All Day Specials:
$10 Pizza & Bud

I'm sitting in the Steakhouse side, because I'm there with friends, 4 of us in a nice booth. The place is EMPTY and it's 5:00 on a Wednesday evening. I walk in from the parking lot to the steakhouse-because that is the closest door to me. I don't even realize there is another side-the Pub, until another friend arrives from that location.

HAPPY HOUR: We proceed to ask for the Happy Hour menu. And we are told by the waiter, there are no happy hour prices in the Steakhouse. But, it's on your ONLINE menu. It is exactly as it is written above. Yes, he says, but that's for the Pub ONLY. Well, it doesn't say that on your online menu, we say. Well, he says, I'll ask the manager. Then he leaves. WE are thinking, do we need to get up from the booth, to go to the Pub side to have happy hour food/drinks? Thinking the manager is going to accommodate our request for happy hour menu pricing, we sit at the booth. The waiter comes back, No. Manager won't budge. 

So if you go there for happy hour, do not sit on the Steakhouse side of the building because it's all FULL PRICE for the same food you would get at happy hour prices on the other side of the wall from where we were sitting. That's just LAME. If you post these prices on the ONLINE menu, then you need to word it so it says These prices are good ONLY IN THE PUB!

Next, my glass of wine is so far the best thing about the place, oh and it's only $5.00 a glass for this Merlot.

We proceed to order our steaks and burgers. There are 4 of us. Two get burgers, and two get prime rib-how do we want it cooked? Medium. Which means pink in the center.

Out come burgers, and prime rib. 

On first glance at prime rib -its grey. No pink. Um....this is very well done for prime rib and not Medium. Waiter comes over, we say-try again please....meaning a new cut...since you can't uncook prime rib..

2nd try: A few minutes later, the same plate, same vegetables/potato arrive, but the meat has pink liquid on top of it, but is still GREY.

3rd try, seriously, this time, brought to the table by the Manager-note, same plate, same vegetables, which have now been handled by the waiter, the manager. Finally get a Medium color of meat on the same plate. 

By this time, our friends with the cheeseburgers are done with their meal.. We are just starting ours. 

We were not offered anything extra to make up for the time we had to wait on the Medium cuts of prime rib. Not even $$ on the bill. 

Rey, our waiter, was excellent. Too bad he informed us that he was leaving, and moving out of state. He had also told us that Chef Anthony, who is mentioned on the ONLINE menu, had also recently quit. Maybe that's why our prime rib did not get cooked right the first time."}
{"text":"Food is overpriced service stinks Paid 50 dollars for a small Pizza and a hamburg never again it was terrible"}
{"text":"Visited this place at 6:30 on a Friday night and it was pretty empty, which should have given me a clue about the food. Everything was very overpriced. I ordered a medium burger with no onions, it came with onions and was burnt. The French fries were so oily and tasted like old potatoes. Don't be fooled by the environment or staff. The food is very mediocre and does not appear to be of the high quality that you think you're paying for. Would not return."}
{"text":"First time here and OMG so good!!! Loved our waiter James; he was super informative and made that much more enjoyable! I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Very good food from appetizer to dessert. You really can't make a bad choice on what dish you get. They had great service so we made sure to tip well since they definitely deserved it. The selection of wine is good and when I was there they had live music playing which was jazz I think. They also had a pretty cool outdoor area with games."}
{"text":"Need to start out on the positive, the food is really very good. Succulent steaks, fresh veggies, huge portions. Now, the down side...Our second visit to this place and the service was utterly terrible. The first visit service wasn't terrific, but this second visit, they outdid themselves! Server named Jonathan was slow getting to the table but no biggy, right? Gives us a little more time to look over the menu to decide what we want to give him our order when he does make it. He finally brings our drinks we place our order. He does not write any of it down........**Red Flag**........Now, I must say, I was in the Service Industry for years and that right there is one of my biggest pet peeves. I should have made him repeat our order back to us to see how badly he got it jumbled up in his head. He leaves the table, we go back to laughing and having a great time with our friends. He walks up about 10 minutes later and asks who had the twice-baked potato........**Red Flag**........None of us Jonathan, none of us have a twice baked potato but you would know that if your wrote our order down. Now, time for food delivery. They have food runners so another person brings out one plate, steak has wrong temperature and wrong vegetables...back it goes......**Red Flag**.......Next plate comes out, wrong vegetables, steak has the correct temperature flag in it, but my history of working in steakhouses tells me it ain't right....go figure, Med Well Filet was Med Rare. UGH!! Next plate comes out and it's right...hallelujah!! Then, mine, wrong veggies again. Mind you, as the plates going back to the kitchen, they decide to bring back single plates with one item on them from the f-ed up meals. WHO DOES THAT??!!! I'd had enough, asked to speak with the manager. Richard came to the table and I sort of let into him. He was extremely apologetic and said he'd fix the bill. Once food all made the table, it was mostly great. Richard did take half off our bill. Until service improves, we will only dine in the bar!!"}
{"text":"We were a party of 8 and we were served by friendly and efficient staff; Jonathan was our main server and he was great.   I had the best plate of scallops ever with giant portions of grilled asparagus and zucchini; delicious.  My husband had pork chops and raved about them. Carrot cake was moist and tasty.  The atmosphere in the steakhouse is very different from the pizza and sports bar out back.  We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I call the place \"buried treasure.\" Buried behind the cop house in dieing downtown Glendale. Despite reports of huge amounts invested in site improvements, the place looks industrially spacious but a bit drab. 

So where\"s the treasure? In the food and service. Our server Jeff was exceptionally attentive and friendly. Better yet, my filet was at least as good as the one I had at Fleming's last month. But the price was 10% lower. My wife's Pasta Cioppino was blessed with an amazing array of perfectly prepared, perfectly prepared fish and shellfish morsels.

Many Yelpers have noted a sharp decline in service quality at the local Fleming's. That includes us. So it's nice to have a less pretentious, more welcoming alternative so close at hand. This place deserves to be busier."}
{"text":"We should have tried the pizza place next door. I was very disappointed with the entire meal and our \"service\" at the steakhouse.
1) ordered a drink that on the menu came listed as grapefruit vodka, ginger beer, lime, soda. It came with half the glass full of previously frozen strawberries. It was decent, but I wasn't in the mood for sweet. When I asked the server about it he just shrugged it off and said it was correct. 
2) The free herb bread is amazing.
3) The expensive steak flatbread is not. Mushrooms were not on the menu and it was 3/4 mushroom for the topping. I would not have ordered it if I saw mushrooms. When I asked the server about it he just shrugged it off and said next time order it without mushrooms.
4) the Caesar salad was drenched in dressing that tasted like mayonnaise. Croutons were massive and soggy. 
5) Had a hard time deciding just what steak so we have the steak dinner for 2 a try, which was difficult considering the cost. Petite filet, baseball cut, and N.Y. strip, all ordered medium rare, all received at 3 different temperatures. All medium well to well done, except half of the filet which was medium rare but the other half was well done and dry. When we told the server he just shrugged it off and walked away. No offer to get it right, just walked away. 
6) We ordered our three sides to be garlic mashed potatoes, onion rings, and Brussels sprouts. We received zucchini instead of Brussels. When we asked the server about it he asked if we were sure then went to the kitchen. He brought back Brussels sprouts and said it was a miscommunication so the Brussels sprouts were on the house. Mashed potatoes were flavorless and had a texture similar to paste. We each took two bites and left the rest alone. The onion rings were nothing special, decent with ranch. The zucchini and Brussels sprouts were nothing short of amazing. Very well cooked and delicious. When we told our server about the potatoes he just asked if we wanted to take anything home with us, no acknowledgement of the pasty potatoes. 
7) When we received our bill the pricing was wrong, higher by a dollar or two then what is published on the menu but at that point we just wanted to leave so we left our money and walked out. 

Long story short, save your money, eat at any of the other fabulous restaurants in OTG. You could eat at any one of them 3 times for the price of this one lousy experience."}
{"text":"We ate in the steakhouse about a month ago.   We each had a different steak with all the side.  Music was playing, food was great and service was very good.  We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would. My friends and I went here for dinner. We made a reservation. Before going we took a look at the menu online. We were interested in the happy hour. The server informed us that the happy hour wasn't available at the steakhouse. We would have to go next door to the pub for happy hour. Come on, it doesn't say that online. Fleming's is a steakhouse and they offer happy hour! One of my friends and I ordered the prime rib medium. Both our prime rib came out well done. The server took it back. Then brought it out a second time. It was the exact same way! It so tough that I wouldn't even feed it to my furbabies! The manager came by and said he would get it right. Well, third times the charm. On the third attempt, they finally gave us medium prime rib. The server did mention that the chef quit. Which wasn't hard to believe because of the food that was coming out of the kitchen. We received our bills and nothing was comped. I like to support local restaurants, but this was an epic fail. Save your money."}
{"text":"No wait staff. You have to go get your own food. Seems like a desperate attempt to save money.   The owners are trashy. They sit in the bar and bicker with each other over the books. They trash talk the staff, and you can tell they just don't give a shit. Seriously bad for business.  Great venue, lots of potential, yet it's all wasted on shitty, overpriced, overcooked food and WAY over priced drinks.  The stakehouse is poorly run and under lit. No wonder it's fkn dead all the time."}
{"text":"I just ate at Desert Rose Steakhouse, and was very disappointed.  My wife and I ate there about four weeks ago, and it was great.  I had the double bone-in pork chop, while my wife had the prime rib.  Everything was cooked to perfection, and we had a great time.

We were very much looking forward to going back to Desert Rose again; however, this time was quite a bit different.

We didn't have reservations on a Friday night, and this initially posed an issue as the place was booked, but the hostess thought we'd be able to get something within a half-hour (no problem for us).  We were seated within 10 minutes, so great start so far.

We ordered the pumpkin salad to share, and the salad was great.  They knew we were going to share, but didn't split it; however, we never actually worry about that (i.e. it's just gravy when a place actually does split it for you, but we don't expect it).

After that, we ordered the same meal we had last time (i.e. double bone-in pork chop, and prime rib).  The sides were double-baked potato and brussel sprouts for the prime rib, and asparagus and mac-and-cheese (called world famous on the menu), for the chops.

We also ordered a bottle of wine for dinner.  The bottle was delivered to the table with two wine glasses, and the server then immediately left; without anything more than \"here's your wine\".  The first things visible, were the jagged edges of the foil around the top of the bottle.  Clearly someone had thrust a cork-screw into this bottle (who knows when), and pulled the cork through the foil violently.  That was what was presented at our table with no apology, no cork (so who knows when it happened), nobody asking if we wanted a taste, or even a pour...and just an open bottle with extreme jagged edges at the top.  What steakhouse, or even restaurant for that matter, doesn't open a bottle of wine table-side?

(Ugh, but I can still get around that if the food is good.)

Unfortunately, It wasn't.  The vegetables were great.  The double-baked potato and mac-and-cheese were ok at best.  The meat was appalling.

We both ordered our dishes medium.  My pork chop was so well done it was inedible.  My wife's prime rib was also so well done it was almost grey, and I'm pretty sure I coughed dust after tasting it.

I complained about my dish, and they re-fired a new chop for me.  Although I told the waitress how bad my wife's prime rib was (and she even visibly saw it for herself), they chose to ignore it because my wife has a problem with criticizing others (i.e. she won't ever send something back).  There also was no manager presence (visible at least) the entire time; even after sending something back, and also complaining about the other entree...even if that part was only verbally one sided, but backed by the waitress' view of the prime rib.

I eventually got my re-fired chop, and the kitchen over-compensated by having the middle partially raw.  I decided that enough is enough, and I'll take the partially raw chop, and re-heat it myself at home from the doggy-bag.

The waitress did offer a free desert...which I never wanted, nor took...but I do respect the attempt.  I still tipped 22%, because although the waitress, kitchen, and management failed us today, there are still others that rely on these tips... and now we have words, and vehicles to use, to show our disappointment; instead of punishing some of the other innocents (e.g. bus people, bar tenders [unless they pulled the cork], etc.).  In addition, it could just have been a very bad night for everyone.

I won't be going back anytime soon, but I gave 2 stars because of my first experience...and I really hope it somehow gets back to that.  I will also say that he outdoor patio was hopping, and we might still try the sandwiches on the gastropub side (as long as the kitchens are separate)."}
{"text":"Definitely recommend this place. The food was delicious. The service was awesome. Steak was amazing and the garlic mashed potatoes definitely tasty. The bacon wrapped jumbo shrimp for an appetizer was a great choice."}
{"text":"Tried this establishment because of the Local First Arizona golden ticket initiative (buy local). The previous reviews mentioned issues with service but my experience would indicate that those issues have been resolved (thank you Brianna). The food was flavorful and the portion was generous. 

I would not hesitate to return and I highly recommend this establishment for its food, character and knowledgeable staff."}
{"text":"We stopped the other night to have a steak and we had a wonderful steak one of the best steaks I've had in a long time. they sure do have those steaks down pat !!! as for the rest of the experience maybe they should just scratch the menu and serve only steaks !!! the sides the desserts everything else really subpar I was very disappointed. If you want to great steak, well, stop in and get a great steak but don't bother to order anything else it's not worth the money .....GUY S."}
{"text":"Four stars for great food, good value and with its large outdoor patio and area, it could be a super venue. We were part of a large group (30+ adults), had reservations in the lounge and several different wait people. It's too bad the service ranged ranged from very good (our busboy and a sweet young blonde woman), to \"Um, we ordered with everyone else so can we get our food and maybe eat with them before they pay their checks and leave?  Never mind, I see their doggy bags so just make ours a to go order . . .\"  (young brunette female).  Whether this was the server or the kitchen's error, it should be addressed. The worst part of it all was the \"entertainment'--a group of 3 or 4 including a guitarist and a guy playing the accordion and an odd-looking Joker type fellow for a visual pop.  We were in the lounge, far away from the music, but unfortunately not far enough away. Many of the sounds they made sounded like a discordant cross between Appalachian Blue Grass and polka music.  I'll give them 1 star for trying. 
I'll come back for the food and value but with lowered expectations for service--and certainly not when that particular band is playing."}
{"text":"Tonight was my 2nd time at Desert Rose Steakhouse.  Glendale SO needs a place like this!  Thanks for filling this void.  We started out with the Bacon wrapped Shrimp!  A meal in itself!  Delectable!   The bread served with oil and balsalmic was , meh..but the meal was great.  I had the Osso Bucco which was enough lamb for two!  Moist and delicious.  My sister had the Seared Salmon, which was perfectly seasoned.  Veggies were basic for Asparagus, Broccolini or a Squash medley. 

On a previous visit i had the Double Bone in Pork Chops.  I can't say enough about that dish...only that I shouldn't have to ask for a steak knife!  It was thick, moist and perfeclty seasoned!  

This restaurant has great potential!"}
{"text":"Fire the manager and the head chef. 3 visits HOPING for a satisfactory experience left us wondering how the people running this place got their jobs!

Service in is the worst. Lots of people \"look\" busy but we were constantly thirsty and stayed hungry for too long.

Pizza was burned on the outside and raw inside, and was $35 by the way! Steak was cold on another visit. 

Please make this work! We need this on the west side!"}
{"text":"At the time of this review this is a newly opened restaurant and it seems that they are still tinkering with things.

This Steakhouse is located in Downtown Glendale. They offer a private parking lot, outdoor dining, a cigar shop and a nearby gastro pub. 

We were greeted by a friendly hostess and she gave us our choice of table or BIG COMFY Booth. The restaurant is sort of open and airy with a typical masculine feel and does have an open kitchen.

I ordered the salmon sandwich. It was a really delicious sandwich and I would have given a solid four stars if my review was only for my lunch. The bread was fresh and delicious. The generous portion of salmon was seasoned nicely and was moist and flaky. The salad was big fresh and crisp. 

Unfortunately I noticed my husband's meal was done and sitting under a heat lamp for at least ten minutes before my sandwich was made. To say the least the bread, meat and cheese in the sandwich didn't arrive in good condition. Also the fries were similar to what budget steak houses serve. 

We waited a while for our waiter to check on us so we could inform him about the French Dip Sandwich and he got a run on tables and wasn't able to stop by for a while. So we started to eat anyway. We did wind up telling the server and we spoke to the manager (maybe owner) in detail about what was wrong with the sandwich and she was very understanding. She also took the sandwich off our bill.

This restaurant is newly opened and they might have some growing pains.

This can be such a great addition to Glendale. The manager seemed keen on working things out I am sure they will be quick to improve.

3 stars is still a positive review and means A-OK according to Yelp."}
{"text":"2nd time I stopped by the associated cigar lounge, during published open hours.  Dead as a doornail.  Again.  Tried the steakhouse - practically empty, waited to be seated for 5 minutes, nothing, left. Not going to try again."}
{"text":"You need to try Desert Rose you won't be disappointed!
They have something for everyone. If your hungry for steak they have that hungry for a pizza they have that
Prime rib sliders and much more. 
Try there Sunday brunch from 10:30 AM to 2:30 PM
You won't find a better brunch in Glendale 
Come and enjoy all the sports and they always have all the UFC fight's."}
{"text":"Today is my official birthday and all of our plans fell through, so my husband decided we should at least go out for dinner and try something new. So Desert Rose it was. Once we decided which side to sit in, we ordered the brie crisp. If you like brie, you'll love this appetizer. We also ordered a whiskey drink that was amazingly delicious. Then I ordered the pumpkin, feta salad. I'm always cautious ordering as a vegetarian. But, I loved the play of flavors and was very satisfied. My hubs had the Philly and was also happy. Our server, darbey, found out it was my bday, and offered me a delicious carrot cake. All in all,My birthday ended a success. The only reason they did not receive 5 stars was because it was a tad hot inside. We will be returning soon though. Thank you, Darby, for helping make my bday great!"}
{"text":"Just had our Christmas party there. Good food, great staff, and real good cocktails. This is going to be a great place for downtown Glendale."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch, it has nice atmosphere. My friend had asked for a draft beer but the waiter said they wouldn't have those for a couple more days. Which was ok, the cocktail he ended up getting was great, apparently. 
I tried to order the ravioli which they also didn't have. I couldn't eat anything else because it was either extremely expensive (understandably, but I don't want to spend $40 on lunch) or swimming in dairy (lactose intolerant). I just wish the waiter had told us ahead of time what the restaurant didn't have. 
I ended up ordering nothing and just ate a couple of my boyfriends fries. They were way over salted. 
I'll come back in a couple months when this place has all of their supplies to actually be up and running. Three stars for now - staff was friendly. Food was apparently ok, boyfriend said he wouldn't come back except to go to the bar.

I'd recommend waiting a couple weeks and then trying this place. It does have a lot of potential."}
{"text":"We came for Sunday brunch.  The buffet was good, not a huge selection, but everything was very good and fresh. The ambiance was awesome! Great outdoor area. A fun place to take the kids at the right time."}
{"text":"This steakhouse has beautiful atmosphere, nice dining music, and the food is great too.  We will most definitely return.  They offer specials on certain days of the week.  Give it a try.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The BEST STEAK I have ever had in my life and that comes from a guy that eats out everyday at good restaurants. The ambiance is great. They treat you well as if your a super star.

Prices are pretty normal for a high end restaurant. They also have Bar food, Giant Burger for $12. Happy Hours Beer and wine $5. I prefer the open bar room. 

The personal is extremely friendly. 

The Cigar Room is amazing. This is a first class operation.

I highly recommend it. They deserve 10 stars."}
{"text":"Alright people of Glendale, we finally have a place that is locally owned, servers delicious food and has the best selection of beers and liquor!

I have two words for you: Angels Envy.  This is the best bourbon you're ever going to taste and Desert Rose carries it!  They actually have a pretty nice selection of whiskey, it could almost be called a whiskey bar.

The steakhouse is a part of a few other restaurants that are pulling off the same concept as the Yard.  There's a huge patio with the same kind of games and lounging areas like the Yard.  However, DesertRose has a cigar bar which neither of the yards can claim.

If you need me, I'll be at my new favorite hangout!"}
{"text":"Wow! A hidden gem close to home! Awesome environment, loved the atmosphere. TVs for the game, live band, food was delish!! The burger was a real burger 1/2 pound was really a 1/2 pound. Salmon salad had a huge piece of salmon. And the the server...... Nicholas was on point!!! Man super impressed!! Heard a lot of mixed reviews on this place but def a new spot for us in fact back tonight for SNF and pizza!!"}
{"text":"My family and I ate here for Easter brunch, they do brunch every Sunday but we thought we'd try it for Easter, it was more than amazing and exceeded my expectations, I have been to the outside bar/gastro pub in the past but this was my first time in the steakhouse section, they had so many things to chose from and everything was fresh and cooked great. Pancakes, French toast, bacon, potatoes obrien, prime rib, ham, omelet station and waffle station so much more ! There were also complimentary mimosas and refills were one cent, I'm not sure if the complimentary mimosas was an Easter thing or if that is every Sunday but reading past reviews all refills seem to be one cent regardless, it was a very good first experience and I will defiantly be going back."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, a little more pricey than $$, but if you want steak come in for the early bird special. We had scallops and steak, both cooked perfectly. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Very Disappointed!!! We come to Arizona every year  to visit family and we always come to Desert Rose and unfortunately this will be the last. About 15 min after we ordered our food we were informed that they ran out of the steaks we wanted. So we had to reorder. The place wasn't that busy and it took over an hour to get the food. After the manager was informed they did nothing to accommodate us beside give us attitude and avoid us anyway they could and the steak wasn't very good."}
{"text":"I found the Desert Rose Steakhouse recently when I happened to stay in downtown Glendale, AZ.  I love this place.  I had the prime rib,  it was the BEST prime rib I have had in a long time.  I do not live locally, although I'm in Arizona on average once a month.  This will be a regular place that I will stop and eat at."}
{"text":"Best spot in town. The food and beer selection is like no other place in the city. Donovan and the rest of the staff always make sure I'm well taken care of. Cigar shop, bar, restaurant, music, and a variety of games. They have whatever you need."}
{"text":"I am so torn... and I am going to copy this review for the gastropub too since I am not entirely too sure what I experienced. The food was good, the facility not so much. We walked into what we thought was a steakhouse/restaurant and were not greeted & when we asked for guidance we were told to seat ourselves and go to the counter to order. Then we heard karaoke, so we headed to the next room, which I think was the gastropub. We sat down and reviewed the menu, then watched some people order before a server (with food in hand) saw our deer in headlights look and came over to us. She walked us through what we should do & gave us a menu since the one I took from the previous room belonged to the steakhouse. 
We went up to the BUSY cashier and placed our order- no tip since we did all the work. If I did not ask for a water cup in addition to our alcoholic beverages we'd have been parched. Our beer & pineapple cider came after a few minutes and my boyfriend had to go back to the bar to order another beer before our food came out. We would have drank about 3 drinks each, but we did not want to have to keep on purchasing them one at a time.
Oh, we also checked outside for seating but I was completely overwhelmed. The outside is beautiful and huge, but it was filled with live music, tons of games and kids- I think there was also face painting taking place. A man walked by and handed us business cards, we thought he might work there, but he was just trying to get the word out about his business. 
The nice server that gave us guidance delivered our food, she said she would be back to check on us, but we only saw her walk by a few times. 
We had already decided we would never dine in again, so we were hoping the food would be awful. We were wrong, the food was really good. I did leave a tip, just because I felt the two people that gave us guidance (cashier & server) deserved to get something, as we were not sure what was what. 
I don't really like crowds, so that in addition to the lack of customer service is why I won't dine in again. I may order to go- but I don't even know if they do that. I am sorry my review is so awful, but it kind of fits into my experience, as I had no clue what was going on there."}
{"text":"Great place to come and relax. Great atmosphere and even better food. If you like \"The Yard\" then you'll love this place. The weather is perfect to be outside and the layout permits that."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, friendly staff! Service was ok and Food was just ok. Need more variety! Want to come back for the games and karaoke!"}
{"text":"This is not a $$ place. It's lucky to be $$$

Our bill for 2 people was $185 with tip. 
The beer ranges from $5-$14 and the mixed drinks average $10 each

Now to be fair, we had 1 appetizer and the steak trio for dinner. 

3 steaks ordered mid rare and all 3 came out different temps. Flavorless mashed potatoes and ok onion rings. The vegetables were very good. The Caesars were way over dressed and the croutons were stale and chewy. 

Service was good but the server was extremely strange. The down side was whenever we mentioned that something was cooked wrong, he shrugged it off. 

Lastly BE AWARE the menu items do not list all the ingredients in them. This goes for food and drinks. Be sure to ask the ingredients for each and every item you order. 

We will not be back to the steakhouse but may try the pizza place next door."}
{"text":"Service was pretty awesome. Slice of pepperoni pizza I had was good. Artichoke dip is served with garlic bread, blah! Sweet wings taste like barbecue sauce. Thai Chili wings is where it's at. Dr's? Mac and Cheese was soooooo plain, served with garlic bread. Took it to go, added pepper, some salt and smoke paprika. Which tasted so much better.

They had soooo much selections of alcoholic beverages! Decently priced. They had a huge patio with comfy seating areas. I saw extra large sized connect the dots and Jenna which was cool. I was told they have bands out there sometimes. Pretty cool."}
{"text":"Came here after we were referred by a friend. Worst $120 I have ever spent. Came for Sunday Brunch, everything looked great but the food had no flavor. The potatoes, the prime rib, the eggs were all terrible.

All of our drinks were warm and flat, they brought us about 4 mimosas all of them terrible. My daughter ordered lemonade, it tasted like water. I ordered a cranberry juice, it was warm.

The only good thing was the DJ. 
I emailed my complaint, never received a response."}
{"text":"Not unlike other comments, I will start by saying, we were really, really trying to like this place as we want nothing more than to have a great restaurant to support in the limited Glendale line-up of eateries.  That said, last night was our last of three experiences at Desert Rose.
We intended to treat our son and daughter in law to a memorable evening to celebrate our son's recent job promotion. Upon entering, our festive mood was blasted half way across Grand Avenue by an amplified saxophone player who nearly blocked our way through the door.  Whose new, creative idea was this??? 
We had a reservation for a booth so happy we were to see it was furthest away from the blaring music but sadly not far enough as it turned out. BAD idea, Desert Rose!

The service continues to be subpar as we soon witnessed with the exception of an extremely attentive busboy who filled our water glasses with enthusiasm all night.  He should be promoted to waiter status as we saw the most of him!

The four of us ordered wine and beer and requested bread for the table.  This continues to be an issue for Desert Rose.  Their \"gourmet prices\" call for bread for the table but they just won't concede.  When asked, they did produce a plate(?) of four pieces of garlic toast......arriving in tandem with our two appetizers.  The artichoke dip (presented with the remaining litter-mates of garlic toast) was not edible.  It was cold, someone forgot some main ingredient and the calamari was the same temperature although anything that heavily breaded can disguise the worst of flavors so it was at least palatable, unlike the dip.
For the sake of time and space I won't give detailed accounts of our disappointing main dishes but I ordered the sirloin, medium cooked at our waiter's suggestion.  I made sure to clarify that the steak would be pink to red which he acknowledged.
Sadly, the steak was well-done and dry, served alongside a Mt. Helens mound of vegetables.....perhaps the most favorable of anything on our table all night and hence, the humongous portion as if I might not notice how bad the steak was.

I'll try to end here shortly.......by saying, none of our meals, including ho-hum desserts were to write home about and that pretty much sums up the Desert Rose.  \"Okay food\" is sometimes acceptable if you're NOT hoping to host a nice, celebratory experience AND if the prices aren't so ridiculously high for what they're trying to sell!  The noisy and annoying saxophone player is not enough distraction from average food at best.

As with so many other start-up restaurants that ultimately fail, Desert Rose is making the same mistake by not knowing what they want to be.  It's all just too confusing.  The decor and prices of the steak house dictate fine dining but because of the casual theme of the pizza attraction, many patrons are wandering around aimlessly in tank tops and yard-work shorts in the bar adjacent to the saxophone player adjacent to the hostess station, adjacent to the front door! (Someone please tell me why he's there!!!)

The hostess, actually, was quite nice!  I even heard her ask us, over \"Body and Soul\", if we were celebrating a special occasion to which we said, \"Yes we are in fact, our son's amazing promotion!\".....
Not that it mattered as we were charged full price for our son's subpar dessert.

Sorry.......the bloom is off the rose for us, Desert Rose.  We tried so hard to love you!"}
{"text":"My husband and I discovered a wonderful \"secret\" last evening, it's called Desert Rose. New 2 in 1 restaurant in downtown Glendale. It offers a steakhouse and a gastropub as well as a beautiful patio with live music and games. The food at the steakhouse was fantastic. My husband was delighted with the Chioppino and I enjoyed some beautiful lamb chops with a rosemary balsamic glaze. We will be frequent visitors."}
{"text":"I've been waiting a while to try this place. It took a while to get it built and I heard that they had many issues with licensing and inspections etc. I have read the previous posts and folks just got understand that it takes a while to get a place up and running 100 %.From what I could see it's just getting better and better. We went with a large group that had a variety of different dishes including pizza,steak, salads etc. everything that I had including the service was excellent. My only complaint was with the bar. It seems as though they have a few inexperienced people working there. I think in time that will come around. 
If you get a chance give this place a try. The owners a lot of blood sweat and tears make this thing work, the least we can do is give it a shot."}
{"text":"Darby was our server, she provided great service and was very pleasant.  The food was great. We will definitely be back. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the atmosphere is fantastic, you can tell someone put a lot of work into the place. Now to the disappointing news, the service and the food was awful. My husband and I went with another couple, I had soup and salad my husband had spaghetti, the other couple had chicken fettuccine, salad,and a French dip.  We had 2 beers and a glass of wine.  The bill came to $ 105.00 with a very small tip due to the poor service. Im sorry to say we will never return"}
{"text":"As my husband and I were seated I noticed the restaurant was a bit loud, there is an open kitchen concept and live music playing. We were seated right between the two which may have amplified the noise.

It took ten minutes for our server to take our beverage order, we selected a bottle of wine, and another ten minutes for it to be poured. I ordered the bacon wrapped shrimp to start, it was tasteless and cold. My husband ordered a caesar salad, however it never made it to the table. Our steaks were delivered to the table before I had a chance to finish my appetizer, our server never once checked on us in the time between courses. The steaks were fair and cooked to our liking, however the baked potato needed more butter/sour cream and I had to walk up to the servers station myself to get steak knives. The server once again never checked on us and our water had yet to be refilled, even though there seemed to be plentiful food runners, bussers, and server assistants.

At this point, I asked one of the hostesses to speak with a manager. The manager came over and I explained everything, saying it was alright if they were busy, I understood as I have been in the food industry for 15 years, but if a server needed help, it was the managers responsibility as a leader to let the staff know that they're a team and it's alright to ask for help, even if it's not ones regular duties. The manager apologized and went on to talk to our server. What blew me away is even after I mentioned the water refill to the manager, our water glasses still remained empty, no job should be too small for management. 

After 15 minutes our server came to our table and apologized, we accepted and ordered one red velvet cake and one creme brulee, however two pieces of cake were brought. The cake was dry, probably pre-cut and remained uncovered in the fridge. The server again apologized and we continued to just ask for the bill, upon receiving the bill a ten percent discount was applied and the caesar salad was never deducted. 

Overall, I will not be returning, it seems perhaps another soft opening is in order as well as a new menu better suited for an even flow of fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Service has really gone downhill in the last year. The food is subpar. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite steakhouses. 

And it is very unfortunate that it is far from where I live. I ended up craving steak that night and so did my girlfriend. I found this place and am grateful I did. Called ahead to ask for the wait and there was none. 

We get here and they have their own little town! Of course it being St. Patrick's Day.. but even then. They had an outside area with family games, live music, great environment, huge board games, and good vibe. We visited this location after we had our steak dinner. 

We got the Steak Trio... my ohhhhhh myyyy  (drooling face emoji). 
With the option of 3 steak cuts, we got the 5 oz. filet, 8 oz. sirloin, and the 12 oz. New York Steak. When I tell you that this was well worth the $100 bill... it was worth every penny. And unfortunate that we could not and did not finish! Sooo much food. We got the side of mac and mashed potatoes with sweet potato fries on the side. Everything was well served. Prior to getting our meal, they have this cheesy bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. That alone was really good. 

I can't leave off by saying that the 5oz. Fillet was perfect. I had never been one to like steak, but that was when I did not know my cuts. And this place cooked it to perfection. We ordered our meets medium. I suggest you all do the same and get this whenever they have it!! You won't regret anything. I will come back one day.. I will. 

The inside of the steakhouse itself is really nice, it has its own character. Love the color scheme and layout. I would definitely recommend this place. 

5 stars in my book, without a doubt."}
{"text":"They don't honor reservation times. Horrible service. Food not cooked to order. Dont eat here."}
{"text":"This place was a pleasant surprise!  The staff was extremely friendly and efficient.  The steakhouse is part of a complex that included a pizza gastro pub, cigar lounge and event center.  The restaurant is industrial chic with Diana Washington and Nancy Wilson playing overhead.  Open kitchen concept works right down to hand tossed pizza. 

We started with house salads that tasted like something I've never had before.  It must have been the vinaigrette dressing!  It's served with delicious warm focaccia.

Brian our server and Angel gave us amazing service.  Now to the food - I had the Osso Bucco.  Just as described the lamb shank was fall off the bone yummy.  The veggies and lamb were sooo flavorful, you could taste each traditional ingredient, even the red wine.  I had the baked potato with mine, but it is normally served with mashed potatoes.  My husband had the salmon.  Beautifully seared with a golden crust served with your choice of two sides.  He sometimes leaves part behind, this was a clean plate!  Can't wait for lunch tomorrow, the other half of my shank.  Be careful with drinks, they do a generous pour, so I left walking on my toes.  Great evening, we will be back."}
{"text":"Food is delicious and the atmosphere is good. Love all the games on the patio. Could have a Lil more menu choices."}
{"text":"My wife and I went Sunday 01/3/2016 for lunch. We had a wonderful server by the name of Thomas. He recommended the Lumberyard Hefe. A very good choice.
My wife had the salad with pumpkin seeds and squash. I am not a salad guy, but I had several \"tastes\" and it was fantastic.
She also ordered the Mac and Cheese which was out of this world.
I ordered the 1/2 pound cheeseburger with fries and it was cooked to perfection.
We finished off our experience with a shared slice of red velvet cake. It was just the right finishing touch for a perfect dining experience.
We will be back."}
{"text":"I think the confusion on the varied reviews here is because this is really like a couple of different concepts rolled into one place. There's the steakhouse, the patio/bar and a cigar bar. 

The TL;DR version: give them a try. It's not the best restaurant you'll ever eat at, but the ambiance and varied menu and entertainment makes it a good stop.

Longer version:

I've been to this place three times over about 2-3 months. I've only eaten at the patio bar area and I've only had sandwiches and pizza. 

Pros:

Patio is comfortable with lots of nice tables, couches and plenty of TVs if you're into sports.
Patio is super dog friendly and large enough that you don't feel like you're crowding another table if you bring your dog
Pizza was really good. Dough cooked well and plenty of high quality ingredients
Diverse beer menu (although last time there were out of quite a few options)
Managers are attentive
Servers are mostly good (had 2 good and 1 not so good)
Decent parking - for anyone who goes to downtown Glendale, this is an issue
Patio games - last time I think I saw patio games available
Live music - night I was there (Wed) a decent musician was set up

Cons
Food service is too slow - You can get the wait on a pizza, but apps and other food is slow.
Service is not consistent. Ex: Some tables get water, some don't.
Prices in the bar area weren't excessive, but not cheap. Two people with 3 beers and a medium pizza runs about $35
The cigar bar near the patio provides some cigar smell. It's not bad, but some people might be sensitive.

Biggest perk for me is the patio is dog friendly and I heard they are even going to offer a dog menu. It's silly, but when I bring my dog I like to give them a treat, too."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the atmosphere and service. There is definitely room for growth with the menu and food quality. Had a similar experience to others at the steakhouse- I hope the constructive criticism given can be taken and things improved because I'd very much like to see a local place with this kind of potential succeed in the west valley. I will continue to visit the Gastro Pub as I have enjoyed it much more and been back several times."}
{"text":"Had amazing service and food!!! The speciality drinks are also a must try! Excited to go back and try more of their food because they have an amazing menu. Definitely a place to go to while in Glendale, AZ."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic!  Great beers and the food was amazing.  I had 16 oz prime rib and it rated right up with the best.  My two sides were fresh asparagus and twice baked potato.  Wow they were so good.  Our server Nicholas was very good and we enjoyed his company."}
{"text":"Went in for dinner last night. The place was pretty empty which was surprising for a Friday night but there was a ton of people outside for whatever was going on there. Started with a couple cocktails, a mule and one of the pie-tinis. The pie-tini was good but honestly it was more like a dessert, which is fine but I wouldn't probably order one if I wanted a 'drink'. The mule was fantastic. We ordered several of them and if I wanted to get loaded, they would be an easy choice. 

The calamari was excellent as was the complimentary bread they bring to the table which makes me think the pizza would probably be awesome. Ordered a baseball sirloin with broccoli and salad. The salad was really good and pretty large. The broccoli was perfectly cooked though I couldn't finish because of all the drinks and appetizers. My steak was pretty undercooked. I know it's hard to cook a giant wad of meat but the inside was basically raw. It was tasty but if you're the type of person that wants their meatwad cooked beyond medium rare, you might want to opt for something else. I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"We wanted so much to like this new local steakhouse. To say our meal was a train wreck start to finish would not be an exaggeration. The only thing done right was the wine bc they did not have to prepare it. We started with spinach dip which was accidentally served with plain soggy untoasted bread that after talking to the waitress were supposed to be crostini. Then we got our salads and had the wrong dressings. Moving onto the main course. My husband ordered the $46 filet stuffed with herb butter served with a side of green peppercorn sauce. His steak was butterflied which is sacrilege to a medium steak, there was no stuffing to be seen and the peppercorn sauce had no peppercorns and no flavor. On the side he had a twice baked potato which was a baked potato skin with a heap of what looked like mashed potatoes. I had a baked loaded potato void of enough stuffing and somewhat  uncooked on the ends. I asked for additional sour cream and got a thing of some runny white stuff that tasted like a sweet runny yogurt not a suitable for a potato. The staff is so nice. They did give us a 50% discount.  In choosing a steakhouse with these prices I would suggest flemings, Ruths  chris, capital grill etc. Looking for a lower priced place Texas roadhouse has much better food. Sorry I wanted to like Desert Rose."}
{"text":"Great steak, sides, and pizza. I have been here many times.  As long as u stay away from the baseball steak everything is great.  Look on their website for their specials"}
{"text":"We have been wanting to try their Sunday brunch for a while. We finally got there last Sunday, but were disappointed. For twenty dollars a person, we expected more and better selection. They were supposed to open at 0930, and while they were open, they were not yet ready. The to order omelets, were not omelets, but scrambled eggs with the ingredients mixed in. The bloody Mary's were nine dollars each, and tasted as if they had maybe on ounce of vodka in them. Disappointed in them as well. 

We wanted to try it, and we did, but we will not have their brunch again. With two drinks and two buffets and tip, our tab ran about $85. Not worth it. We could have gotten a better breakfast elsewhere for half the price."}
{"text":"We were in town for a football game and ate our annual steak pre game lunch. The food was delicious and would highly recommend the restaurant."}
{"text":"I drive past this place every Wednesday for work and I been wanting to try it. Today j dragged my boyfriend and his friend in with me we were totally pleased everything was amazing the steak was so juicy and perfectly grilled. I asked for a well done steak and usually places serve you a burnt steak mine was juicy and just PLAIN OUT DELICIOUS! Our dessert was chocolate cake and oh man that thinG just melted in your mouth. We will be back and will share with every one we know. Staff is Amazing too!"}
{"text":"Looking for a nice place to eat in the Peoria, Glendale area. Has previously seen this place getting off Grand and going into Glendale. From outside this place is fresh looking. New paint, new signage. Kind of an odd location for a restaurant and not very fancy from the outside. I looked at the reviews and menu. It was a little pricy but this was a special occasion we were celebrating. I had already been to several of the other pricy places in the Peoria, Glendale area and none really impressed me even though they had some good reviews. So time for a new place. 
Inside the decoration was simple. Large room with booths along the wall and tables in the center. Open ceiling, nice hanging lights. This seems to be common to many places I have been as of late. Simple and open. I am not necessarily fond of this type but this seems to be the new norm. I like something to look at while I wait for my meal. 
I read the reviews. I almost never read the 4 or 5 star reviews as they only tell you the restaurant got everything perfect.
The real test of a great restaurant is how they react when things don't go as planned. 
I got a 16oz. T-bone (rare), green beans, and onion rings. My wife got the 8oz. sirloin with carrots and bake potato. My steak was properly cooked and very tender. My wife's steak was very well done. (not as ordered) supposed to have a pink center. We told our server and he took it back. Shortly the manager appeared and apologized for the mistake. Soon he reappeared with a appetizer of beacon wrapped shrimp, big shrimp and delicious. Way beyond my our expectations. 
Our server was Edwardo, I did not get the managers name. Edwardo was excellent. Not under or over serviced. Just the right amount of attention. If you are lucky you will get him. He is good. 
Why a 4 and not a 5? I rarely give a 5 first visit and as of lately I must go at least two times to get a 5. 
How good was the service and food? I am planning a return trip and I already know what I want. An order of the shrimp with green beans and a small salad. 
I enjoyed my meal and the great service."}
{"text":"We made reservations for Valentine's day and we ordered drinks and the $99 steak trio for 2 after our salads were dropped off our waiter never stopped by to check on us until our food came about 30 mins after we ordered the place was busy but not full. Not only where our drinks never ordered or brought to us but we ordered as our 3 steak choices the sirloin, ribeye, and baseball steak we were givin 2 sirloin and ribeye after pointing out the mistakes with the drinks and only being told sorry I'll have them removed from your bill we ate and left for a $99 dinner the services was not good, food was good but wrong order and very small portions for price paid we got Mac n cheese mashed potatoes, and seasonal vegetables was only 7 pieces of asparagus and a single scoop of mash potatoes left feeling ripped off.  Very very disappointing for what was supposed to be a Valentine's dinner at the very end the waiter came and apologized for the error and said if it was him would be pissed and yelling and brought us a piece of cheese cake on him"}
{"text":"Took my mother in law here for an early mothers day dinner. We had an incredible meal with an amazing server named James. Price was a bit high, and the fine dining experience does not fit the location. Overall, I plan on coming back for another fantastic meal with James."}
