{"text":"Service was bad. We waited an hour for our food. We were initially seated outside but little did we know everyone was smoking outside. First and last time going to that place"}
{"text":"We had a Few hours lay over at Terminal D. Looking at its menu, which mostly consists of burgers and sandwiches, you can't really messed up on them, right? Well, it turned out it was a horrible dining experience!

1) Service was not good, slow and unattentative. Waitress walked around while there're are lots of customers waiting for food. No hustling for the service.

2) Food was one of the worst I ate. Seriously, the food resembled one of those failed restaurant food, lack of taste and not fresh. We ordered a clam chowder, which is not better than a canned soup. The fish in my fish taco is so dry. The rice was super hard.. Literally like eating pebbles. My wife's burger is dry as well.

For 35 dollars of stuff we ordered, it's totally a waste. I wish I had spent it somewhere on a cup of coffee and a subway. If this restaurant was located somewhere else, it would be a fairly quick to be out of business. I am really wondering what the owner of this restaurant doing, hopefully he or she is not just sitting at a different place and enjoying milking money out of the airport traveller's pocket!"}
{"text":"Service is a Lil slow. My turkey sandwich was tasty but the fries were not too fresh and the oil in the deep fryers is in a desperate need to be changed"}
{"text":"Great hot wings but the service and entrees were horrid. The fries came with so much raw garlic they were in edible.  Poorly cooked chicken-- was dry and nasty. Server was not helpful."}
{"text":"With a two hour lay over in Clevelland I needed a bite to eat.  This place was there, and was written up by many as very good.   I think they go for the beer!  My sandwich was HORRIBLE...no other way to describe it.  It seems like it had been pre-fabbed and was flavorless other than the wasabi mayo which may have killed the rest of the flavor...the bread, soggy and wet....just NOT GOOD and for that bad food I had to pay $15.00. 

If you are stopping for the food, go two spots down to the MacDonald's kiosk, you will be much happier!"}
{"text":"Yikes, watch out for this place.  I should have yelped this place first, but like many of the other reviewers, I fell into the \"chain\" and decent atmosphere allure of the Gordon Bierch

I ordered a steak salad where the steak was either freezer burned or made from substitute meat.  Maybe both?  The Calamari tasted like fried cardboard.  Same consistency as well!  Again, I couldn't tell if it was freezer burned or was some sort of hybrid fungi or soy replacement meat.  I'm putting my money on all of the above aforementioned theories as that guess is as good as any.

Staff was nice and even removed the streak charge on my salad and I can't knock them for having a job to make ends meet.  It's not the server's fault that the food being served isn't fit for a prison.

I can however seriously warn anyone that will listen, keep looking!  I don't usually go out of my way to trash a place, but wow, does this place deserve it."}
{"text":"Awful experience. The servers are rude. Food average at best. Simply horrible experience. One server in fact asked me to leave the table as I had already ordered at the bar. And then, as I was waiting for my food at the bar she asked me to stand at the entrance by the door as she needed more space. And all this as if she is doing me a favor serving the food, when I have paid for it. Lost 20 dollars, I say. Never ever again."}
{"text":"I've been to other airport bars that were much better but honestly...this one's not bad.

During our layover, we grabbed a few Schwarzbiers and a Bleu Cheese Chip Snacker, which are basically fancy nachos made with housemade potato chips, blue cheese, some cheese sauce, and plenty of bacon. Not gonna lie, these were reaaaally good -- or I was just seriously craving some cheese and bacon. Either way, a good snack to tide us over until we arrived home for dinner.

Service was friendly and relatively fast, and I was only a few steps away from my gate."}
{"text":"The waitress was welcoming and pleasant. I thought of ordering the burger and she steered me to a couple of other popular options. I chose the chicken avocado sandwich with garlic fries. When it came out I was pleased- it looked good. The fries tasted good; they were garlicky and not greasy. As for the sandwich,the flavor was good but the chicken was rubber. Literally. The tomato on it did not look good. It had shredded lettuce and a slice of fresh avocado. I didn't eat it and she noticed and removed it from the bill. Agree with other reviewers- just drink here. Location is right in front of D6 gate and the bar had several outlets to charge my phone and sturdy hooks to hold my purse."}
{"text":"Remember you are in an airport. That said it has reasonable pricing and good size portions. Very good beer. Garlic fries help the beer go down so beer careful."}
{"text":"Decent airport food. Service was good and the food arrived quickly. I didn't try the squid, but then again, I generally stay away from seafood when away from the shore.  The turkey club wrap was completely acceptable, with sliced cucumber giving some surprising fresh elements."}
{"text":"I'm starting my review as I sit in this terrible idea of a establishment. Like many others here I did not check yelp until after I ordered. The menu is pretty bland from my point if view. I ordered a burger with garlic fries and my girlfriend ordered a vegi wrap. Let's hope for the best.. 

So far it's been 25 minutes and no sign of food. Our plan begins to leave in another 45... Hardly got refills on our flat sodas and tap water. Not to mention from where we sit we can clearly see the kitchen. It looks pretty dirty. The waitresses all leave food sitting in the window for almost 10 minutes at a time. It's insane. I'm positive that my burger will be nasty given the waitress never even asked how I want it cooked.... Fail. Fail everywhere. 

Just took my first bite. Beyond under seasoned burger. Cheese is dry and not cheesy. They also told me the don't have pickles?????? Da heck?! Fries are awful as well and slightly cold. Girlfriend despises her wrap as well. She says everything is super bland"}
{"text":"I fly in and out of CLE most every week. And not to give in to one bad experience I tried this place three times.
The first experience was horrible, food never came, when I told the bartender I had to board my flight, she looked visibly annoyed and told me \"you are still paying for your drink\" (Did she think I was gonna run away? I sat there for an hour with no food, I clearly I was committed)
Second time I ordered a salad, I figured my chances on getting something as simple would be better... FAIL, the salad seemed 3 months old.
Finally (yes I'm a sucker for punishment) I tried again. I waited about 10 minutes for someone to acknowledge me, thought there were about 5 servers at the end of the bar chatting. Same bartender (Kim) Same apathetic attitude, just as rude as before, though I think this time she remembered me because not only my order took over 45 minutes to arrive, not once she made eye contact with me, not once she addressed me after taking my order, not once she asked me if the food was OK (which it wasn't) never once she asked for refills, though i waited 45 minutes for my food...I might as well have not been there at all. I noticed also that it wasn't just me, she was just as delightful with the people sitting next to me at the bar.
In regards to the food.. this time i ordered the chicken avocado sandwich, another epic fail. There was so much of what looked like a white sauce on it the bread was soaked. the avocado was blackened from having sat outside for too long for what I could guess, and the garlic fries... Well lets just say that Dracula wasn't coming anywhere near me that day.
I still fly out of CLE, but now I walk over to a different concourse to eat dinner."}
{"text":"Oh, if only THE Gordon of Gordon Biersch could see this location....

I think he would frown on the lack of garlic fries on the menu. All the GB classic plates are replaced with.... SANDWICHES? Who's restaurant is this? My frat boy brother's??? Seriously, sandwiches and beer makes me pretty much.... Drunk. Ordered a wich and a brew, and then complimented the sub-par food with a trip down to Chili's Too (ALSO in D terminal). 

Boo hiss. Three stars for the Martzen."}
{"text":"NO GARLIC FRIES?!?  BLASPHEMY!!!

After exploring every nook and cranny of the D terminal searching for something remotely edible, I saw Gordon Biersch and my salivary glands immediately went into overdrive thinking about those sinfully good garlic fries.  So I pony up to the bar and....D E N I E D!

They only serve pre-made sandwiches.  WEEEEEEAK!"}
{"text":"Unresponsive staff. Kitchen closes before 830pm. Ended up wasting my time until everything else was closed too.
Can't rate the food because they closed the kitchen before I was able to talk to anyone."}
{"text":"I hope you read all of the reviews before you go into the restaurant, they are accurate.  I sat down and ordered before I yelped this place. Rookie mistake. Do yourself a favor and put the menu down and just walk out. Now."}
{"text":"Came here because I was stuck at the Cleveland airport for a few hours, and I got their cashew chicken salad which was a not-so-good, not-very-fresh mix of lettuce, cashews and chicken.  The chicken tasted weird so I only ate a few pieces of it.

Their garlic fries were really good though but totally overpriced for $6 for a side of them."}
{"text":"This place does not have a great atmosphere and the service was a little slow- although friendly.

It almost felt like a cafeteria- but the prices were high, even for an airport.

I only stopped in for a little liquid courage before my flight on a teeny tiny plane, so I can't comment on the quality of the food."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for breakfast.  I also happened to have one of the few beers I've had all year.  Eggs and Beer.  That's a new one for me; one I won't soon repeat however would if the opportunity presented itself with the right circumstance.  Good food.  Good beer.  Airport prices kind of suck, but I was hungry and it was a match made for my stomach."}
{"text":"You are a restaurant in an airport, your customers don't often have a lot of free time. I waited ten minutes at a table, but no one even looked me despite my trying to literally wave someone down. I had to make a connection, so I left. Awful service, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"For airport food I found it to be reasonably priced and pretty tasty.  Perhaps our bar was set low after a horrible experience at Gordon Ramsay's Pub in Vegas the day before (stay away Yelpers!), but this was a great spot for an appetizer or two and some beers on a layover.  Server was friendly too and quick.  If I find myself in the D Terminal at Hopkins again... i'd return for the same thing again!"}
{"text":"Poor food. Greasy. Over sauced/dressed. 

Waitress was nice."}
{"text":"Located in Terminal D.  I had a long layover and needed a bite to eat.  I figured that Gorden Biersch was a 'chain' and that you couldn't go too wrong with a chain in an airport versus a local establishment making a second location.  Boy was I wrong.

Walked in after the lunch rush and sat at a table after some hesitation.  No one greeted me, even with the bartender standing 10 feet away.  I sat and a waitress came over asking if I wanted something to drink.  I asked if the iced tea was fountain or brewed and she replied it was fountain.  Nestea.  I scrunched up my nose.  She insisted it was good and she liked it.  Knowing what fountain iced tea tastes like and that I do not like it at all should have been my first clue - that she didn't know what she was talking about.  I ordered a diet soda, which happened to be Pepsi (no Coke products).

I hemmed and hawed at the menu, looking for something lighter.  The soup of the day was Tuscan 3-Bean, which again the waitress said was good.  Didn't move me so I ordered the turkey club wrap.  She said it came with cole slaw or did I want fries.  \"How is the coleslaw?\"  \"It's good, I like it\".  Bingo.  Should have listened to my gut and changed the order.  

The coleslaw was the most non-tasting bland slaw I've every had.  It needed salt or pepper or SOME kind of \"exotic\" spice.  Looked like coleslaw but tasted like nothing.

The turkey club wrap was just as bad.  Very dry as they toasted the spinach wrap and didn't put anything on it.  Lunchmeat turkey, not fully cooked bacon, chopped red onion, lettuce, tomato and shredded cheddar cheese.  I asked three times before I got a side of mayo for it.  And something in the wrap was \"off\", I just couldn't put my taste buds on it.

I was extremely disappointed with my food.  I eat in airports a lot and don't have a high bar for airport food, but this place was waaayyy underneath.  The service wasn't all that great either between not having an opinion, not being responsive and the bartender not helping and just standing around checking her phone the whole time.

$13 and change for the wrap, soda, and tax.

Keep walking a bit down the terminal and there is a Subway."}
{"text":"Is it commonplace for Gordon Biersch to hire the most incompetent staff at GB airport locations?
The 2nd airport GB I've visited, with same sketch \"service\" and general incompetence as the first.  Sad, really..."}
{"text":"Food is awful here!!!  My bartender was nice but it sounds like other people have issues. Go to Yuengling instead!!"}
{"text":"Service was polite if not friendly but they clearly need to invest in a tea kettle.   The water in my tea was about as hot as a faucet and ditto for the oatmeal which clearly came out of a packet."}
{"text":"not sure why the low rating.. who cares about the food, you come here for the beer.  The beer was good and the bartender was quick... very quick.  Its conveniently located next to gates that are always delayed, well done!"}
{"text":"Worst calamari ever, though the sauces it came with were good. Not enough to rough through the plate of over cooked and under seasoned pieces of cardboard. Burger was so so. I like mine medium well to well done, but even this was a bit much. Dry as can be, bacon burned to a crisp, and a bun that fell apart made it \"interesting\" but still way better than the calamari. I don't think ill ever be back here when I'm passing through."}
{"text":"Only eat there if you have no other choice. Avoid the teriyaki chicken, certainly not marinated. Vegetables were so overly cooked they were soggy.  

Fish tacos seem to have mystery fish. 

Waitress was rude. 

Cost was very high for very poor food."}
