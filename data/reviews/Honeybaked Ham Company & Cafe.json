{"text":"Went one afternoon for a quick lunch while waiting for my car to be serviced at the dealership across the road. Ordered my usual fav chicken salad on a croissant. Very disappointed as it appears I must have ordered the mayo sandwich. Disgusting!! Mayo was literally oozing out of the sides. Made myself eat two bites because I was starving and threw the rest away. I have always been a fan of HBHC, but  something or someone was off this time."}
{"text":"Have to get great turkey and ham....and no cooking!!! Must have the carrot cake too!!!O
there is just no better way to have turkey and ham with absolutely zero fuss.  I really enjoyed my annual trip to HBH Co.  It was quick even though the line was long.  Had a chance to talk to some great folks in line...and the cashiers were outstanding with recommendations!
Ordered both ham and turkey on the phone..and the convenience was just unbelievable."}
{"text":"Honeybaked ham has the most amazing sliced turkey, with brown sugar on top. I'm so glad I just randomly went into this location and purchased some. The employee who checked me out was also very friendly, patient and knowledgeable which I really appreciated."}
{"text":"Good lunch place for a great sandwich. Quick and friendly. Great turkeys and sides for special occasions."}
{"text":"We patronize this place for two different reason.  On multiple occassions for family get togethers, we'll order a spiral cut ham and a couple of sides.  Always good and it takes a lot of stress out of having to prepare a meal for 10 -12.

Hint however.  Can be pricy but coupons are readily available and in many cases, people in line at Honey Baked has extra coupons so it makes it more reasonable.


The other is the Cafe Side.  More of a deli experience but the  sandwichs are big and full of meat and great for a pleasurable lunch."}
{"text":"Great tasting ham, if you haven't tried it before, you keep coming back for those special moments like easter, thxgvg amd Christmas.   Hint: You dont need to wait until those holidays to enjoy their ham, they serve lunch as well all year long!   Refreshing place to dine and the staff is wonderful."}
{"text":"Sandwich was good, however would have preferred a heartier bun. Cookie was undercooked  Service was good."}
{"text":"I had never had a sandwich from honey baked ham before. I was pleasantly surprised with all the options. And the gentlemen who were working for very polite. I didn't feel rushed ordering my food, and the food came out correct and was yummy!"}
{"text":"Always friendly and helpful employees. Love their sandwiches for lunch. Always get my Thanksgiving and Christmas ham here. Love their sides too."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. Got a 1/2 salad and 1/2 sandwich plus a bottled water for about $10. Everything was fresh and was made very quickly."}
{"text":"I have been coming here once a week for about two months and I have not had one negative experience. Always delicious, always friendly service and very timely and quick. Great place for a terrific ham sandwich!"}
{"text":"Always friendly, prompt and delicious sandwiches. You pay for what you get. Always a fan of the tavern club and classic."}
{"text":"On a recent visiting to a division in Kings Mountain, NC, Honeybaked Ham lunches were served during my business meeting.

Some of the boxes said \"Turkey\" while others said, \"Ham\".  Then I saw the \"BBQ\" box!  I have never had a Honey Baked Ham boxed lunch before, so I really didn't know what to expect.  Upon opening the box in anticipation, I saw that there was a sandwich, cookie, potato salad, and condiments.  First, I ate the potato salad, which was very good.  It tasted like home made.  Then I opened the sandwich.  it was larger than I expected.  It was like a 6\" sub format.  

It turned to be a smoked ham sandwich with a touch of Carolina BBQ sauced drizzled on it.  It looked and smelled amazing.  The first bite sent me into orbit.  Wow, I thought!  This was a fast food sandwich?  And the ham tasted like it had been smoked for hours and hours.  Wait, it was!  This is Honeybaked Ham, after all...my favorite ham of all time!  It was oh so good!  I really want another one right about now.  Definitely one of the best store bought sammiches I've ever eaten.  Yum!

{"text":"Sometimes, Sunday family dinner is just too much to deal with.  Menu planning for the various generations, how many teenagers - related by blood or related by friendship - will be around, who's bringing what...  On those Sundays, it's Honeybaked Ham Co. to the rescue!

It's easy to walk in, pick up and go and, when I get home, the quality of the product is always good and consistent.  This location has a nice, helpful staff and the Manager will do things like knock $ off the price of an 8 lb. ham if I come in for a 6 lb. one and they don't have that smaller size.

I've never tried any of the other meats but do hear that the smoked turkey is tasty.  I have though tried some of the sides and they are the reason for 4 stars vs. 5.  I just don't think they are that good."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service and a consistent great sandwich!

Highly recommend finding the HoneyBaked Ham store and trying it out for lunch."}
{"text":"\"on reservation only\" for a quarter size ham is ridiculous. If you cannot handle supply and demand at Thanksgiving and Christmas,AND this is your purpose of being in business, as long as Honey Bake store been in Cornelius just close up! It's like a sickening greedy tactic to sell a larger ham and make more money if people are unaware you cannot walk in this HoneyBake store and purchase the smaller ham.

Please explain if I walk out of Steinmart into the HB Store how am I supposed to know a reservation for a quarter ham is required? Do you advertise that on your website or a banner on your store? REALLY.. 

We have choices -- Smithfield Ham here I come.. maybe not as good as HB but at least they variation of sizes in Walmart and Food Lion.."}
{"text":"I never knew that Honeybaked Ham offered sandwiches until I saw a Groupon for it online. Since it was close to home I snatched it up, and we headed into Honeybaked Ham for some lunch yesterday.

It's pretty easy to find, as it's attached to some strip stores in Cornelius in the Fresh Market lot. Stepping into Honeybaked Ham reminded me somewhat of a Cracker Barrel, in that it had that homey kinda look to it. There are a good number of tables inside and they were nicely spaced, so you don't feel cramped at all. They do sell their fresher meats and sides for dinner takeout, or you can purchase frozen meals and cook it yourself at home. I wanted lunch eats so we headed over to the sandwich register and ordered away. The cashier taking our order was pretty slow and relatively unfriendly, but the other cashier who brought our food over to our table was nice and friendly.

I ordered the Betta' Ham and Chedda and was pretty happy with it. It came with a good portion of their ham along with cheddar cheese, some savory sauce and honey mustard. If you've ever had a Honeybaked Ham you know how tasty that meat is, and to have it on a sandwich was just excellent. I wasn't a fan of the savory sauce, which was actually way too sweet.  I did like the bread, which was a hearty, crusty ciabatta roll. 

The miss' ordered the Swiss it Is, which was basically a ham and swiss sandwich. She also did not like that savory sauce, and I would recommend asking for it on the side at the very least since it appears on several of their sandwiches. 

The sandwiches are very filling. Also, all the sandwiches come with chips, which are nothing fancy (either Lays or Sunchips.) To get the sandwich and chips for between $6-7 (depending on which sandwich you choose) is a pretty good deal, especially since they are very filling and of pretty decent quality. Though the service may be a bit slower than it would be at other sandwich chains, I'd still go back here if I was in the area around lunch time and my tummy started grumbling."}
