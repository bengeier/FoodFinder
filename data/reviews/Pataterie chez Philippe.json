{"text":"Mon petit bonheur hebdomadaire ! 

Une vraie légende ! 

 Même lorsque la fil d'attente va jusqu'à l'extérieur du restaurant, le service est rapide et courtois. La poutine Italienne, faites avec une sauce à la viande sans tomate, donc pas vraiment italienne, est la meilleure poutine de Montréal. Sans l'ombre du moindre doute.

Rapport qualité/pirx INCROYABLE"}
{"text":"Excellent place for poutine, fries, hot dogs, classic canteen with reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I am always on the lookout of a good poutine. Everyone has their idea of what makes up a good one, here is mine...

Fries that are not too thick, not too thin, must taste potato like, not too greasy, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside with a little salt. As for the gravy, nice flavor, no lumps. Cheese on the bottom, then fries, then cheese, then sauce. God, I am a pig but if I am going to splurge, it needs to be worth it:)

It's on Amherst in the Village, nothing special in terms of decor etc but it is always busy, the owners are very freiendly and the food is always good.

Another thing... the poutine comes in a styrofoam bowl, which always makes it taste better in my opinion:) I am weird like that:)

Anyway,  I always order the small, with extra cheese which they  put on the bottom, they cook your fries when you order and the counter is right infront of everything so you see it being made which I also appreciate. They do not salt their fries, so once they are cooked they bring me my bowl, so I can salt them, then take it back to the counter to finish making it.

Their hamburgers are really good as well. They are no frill type of burgers, don't expect a multitude of special toppings but the meat is freshly ground on location daily, and all their toppings are crisp and fresh and the end result is a very happy mouth!


Try them out if you are in the area. Oh, they are not open late, so check the website out for their hours."}
{"text":"This has become my go-to place for steamies and fries... just ask for the fries well done if you want them crispy, like I do. Fries come unsalted, so take a packet if leaving or salt as needed. Quick service. Food comes hot. Great for take-away. As for atmosphere... if that's what you want, go to IKEA... you came here for the steamie!"}
{"text":"If there were six stars I'd give it a higher rating. This is not health food, the decor and ambience is very ordinary. But the food: when you are in the mood for a perfect-I mean truly perfect diner burger from fresh, not from frozen preformed patties but smashed into an edible form, this is the place. If Anthony Bourdain had included this place on his 24hr layover in Montreal he would have added on a week to his visit. The \"Zeke\" is not just an extraordinary piece of diner genius (a burger in the middle of a grilled cheese sandwich! Sheer brilliance!), it is as close as you can get to a heartattack without dying while simultaneously experiencing what another reviewer here called a Burg-asm. Don't even get me started on the poutine-crispy fries, perfect brown sauce, 2 packs of cheese for the large!!! And then the service...to wit: a man pulls up outside in a motorized wheelchair and the cashier leaves his post, walks out to meet him, takes his order than brings his food to him when it was ready. Charming, friendly, helpful and an opportunity to experience unbridled mouth joy from an independent authentic Quebecois diner. Do not judge a book-or a greasy spoon-by its cover. This is a gateway to food heaven."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Like traveling back in time to a place where people took pride in this kind of fast food. The family that runs the place really seem to care. The poutine is as it should be - the fries are the perfect texture. We order 'Le Zeke' a burger between two grilled cheese sandwiches - and split it between us. YES! A BURGER BETWEEN TWO GRILLED CHEESE SANDWICHES! A real gem."}
{"text":"Will keep this short and sweet. 

Burger = 8/10. Mouthwatering burger. Quality beef with robust flavor. Nice and smashed resulting in a nice sear on the edges. I usually get a a bacon cheese burger with lettuce and grilled onions. Amazing. 2nd best burger ive ever had (after Burger Priest in Toronto). I took 2 points off due to the size of the patty. The patty is very small and this seems to be the norm in Montreal. If it were an inch smaller, it would be a slider. Same thing with uniburger...kid sized burgers. 

Fries = 2/10. The fries have a great texture but zero great taste. They taste like oil. Take a tablespoon of peanut oil and add ketchup and you've tasted the fries here.

Also, be ware that these people prepare your food with their bare hands. No gloves or anything."}
{"text":"Don't let the \"divy-hole-in-the-wall\" decor get to you. This place has been around forever and what this place is, is a burgers and fries place and that's it. Thing is they don't do it well, they go above and beyond by grinding their own chuck every morning and kicking you in the teeth with a burger-gasm. It's right up there with Restaurant Grégoire in Mercier. It's the burger that burger dreams are made of. Seriously GO. EAT. NOW.

The fries are also top notch. The rings, though frozen, are still awesome and to top it off they haz Stewart's soft drinks. And all this is some cheap eats to. Wam bam thank you mam."}
{"text":"Ils n'utilisent pas le meilleur fromage pour leur poutine et la sauce manque définitivement de punch. Sinon les frites sont bonnes et les steamés aussi! Bon casse-croûte mais je préfère Lafleur ?"}
