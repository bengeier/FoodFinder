{"text":"Took a random exit off the 401 - googled restaurants - and after sulking a bit about my options (goodies like McDonalds, Wendy's, Subway) - I was thrilled to find an independent with a pretty nice patio (in a strip mall no less).

Wine selection was minimal - but most patrons were drinking Canadian - so I can't really judge ;)

The waitress was super friendly - and was happy to piece together something to my liking. I paired the appy pan seared scallops with a half Greek salad... And it was pretty darn good for a pub style place :) The scallops were perfectly cooked and the salad was really fresh! The only thing I'd change is the leeks that the scallops come on - they were a bit \"blah\". 

Overall - the chipper waitress (who'd only been there for a week, but seemed to love working there) and the fresh food.... gives this place a 4/5 from me :)"}
{"text":"We dropped in last Thursday night and it was the worse meal ever.  It was not busy,
yet it took 40 minutes to get the appetizer and over an hour to get a sandwich which
arrived cold.  The steak was as thick as a pancake, yet was priced as though it were
a good cut.  Would not recommend this restaurant to friends.  A big disappointment!"}
{"text":"I go here with my girls all the time when I am in the country.  Been around awhile new owners I think around a year ago they seem to have kept up the food standards.
A little pricey we usually each order an appetizer and then split between us :)
Great food with a nice glass of wine, good atmosphere and staff."}
