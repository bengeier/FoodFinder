{"text":"What a great addition to the Moon Twp. area! You wouldn't expect to find a place like this in an office park. We stopped in on a Friday mid-afternoon. The place was empty, and we didn't know what to expect. We only wanted a beer and some appetizers. Both were great. The beer selection contains craft and traditional brews. We had a selection of salsas, the tortilla soup, and the Mexican flatbread. The ingredients were very fresh, and the flavors were a nice blend of savory and spicy. Will be back for a full lunch or dinner next time!"}
{"text":"This is the absolute best place in Old Town! The customer service is unmatched!! See Adam or Micaela she is the definition of a great manager and had great attention to detail. This place is so much fun! Then go upstairs and bowl."}
{"text":"Very boring and bland. I ordered the lunch fajitas and there was barely enough meat to make 2 skimpy set ups. Onions were also raw"}
{"text":"Very good authentic Mexican and drinks were also very delicious! 
My biggest bitch .... SLOWEST SERVICE EVER
We sat at the bar and it took forever for everything. My advice, get a bartender who can multitask or get more than 1 bartender. Just can't get over how slow it took for everything."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  HORRIBLE.  Wait staff is frequently MIA.  Drinks take thousands of years to order and billions to receive.  Details like not having place settings are completely overlooked despite asking for them 20 zillion times.  No one will go outside their scope of work.  PLEASE JUST GET US A PLACE SETTING so we can EAT OUR FOOD that took a trillion years to get.  The quinoa salad....aahaahhaaha.  It was like store bought bagged cabbage and some quinoa...nothing else that is mentioned on the menu.  Wait staff continually brought us items we didn't order and they had to walk around the restaurant to find who ordered the items.  Wait staff couldn't answer simple questions about their menu or drinks.     

The restaurant is located in the \"entertainment district\" (bars, bars and bars).  I wouldn't expect food service to be a priority over here but why attempt something if you don't really know what you're doing?  

Shame.  Kind of a cool space, but would be tough to ever try and endure that experience again.  Good luck."}
{"text":"I come here almost every weekend! The service is always timely and consistent. The food is so delicious and never takes too long! It is a lively place to go on the weekend nights with great music and young crowds. I also enjoy going Sunday for brunch and the menu has a big variety for my vegetarian diet. The happy hour during the week is great and there aren't ever too many people. The servers always have a great attitude and disposition! It's always a fun place to go!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my dinner here. Had some great tequilas that were offered in flights  LOVE THAT also as diffrent margaritas in flights as well. The service was great!! Our food was oustanding loved all the food had the special as well as other menu items. They were all really prepared beautifully. I will return.."}
{"text":"Service was extremely slow, drinks were very pricey, food was lousy! A huge disappointment."}
{"text":"Ate late lunch here. Street parking in neighborhood.  Ordered nachos and chips with cheese spinach dip., two enchiladas, two tacos and burger. Food entrees were very good and service excellent. Sports tv showed hockey, baseball, basketball and football news. Bar looked inviting during happy hour."}
{"text":"This was our first stop for St. Patrick's Day. We got there about 2 pm and it was surprisingly dead which was fine since we had a large group. It took 30 minutes to get a bar tender to help us and then another 20 to get the drinks because they continued to forget our order. I would say this bar missed out on at least $500 extra dollars by not tending to our group. While I was standing waiting to be helped, I looked around the bar and every other person was also waiting...impatiently. Not a fan and definitely not worth the frustration."}
{"text":"My husband & I LOVE their fish tacos & fried ice cream!! So flipping good! That's our go to place for lunch or dinner"}
{"text":"We came for happy hour, which runs from 3-7pm, and Taco Tuesday. Our server Kayla was very friendly and attentive. The appetizers were half off for HH.

I had the tortilla soup, which was flavorful with a generous serving of avocado. I also ordered Barbacoa and Baja tacos, which are $3 a la carte for Taco Tuesday. Food came out very quickly. I recommend asking for the spicy salsa to complement the tacos.

The venue has large televisions throughout, so it's great for watching sports. It is open air in the front with semi-outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Food was really good. My wife loved her burrito and the pork and pineapple tacos were great. The salsa that they bring with the warm tortilla chips had just enough heat. Modelo on tap is always a winner. My favorite part of the night was the outstanding choices of tequila. Get a flight of tequila and you can try 3 at a time. Prices were very fair. Service was personable and fun. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Good, fast, and tasty Mexican food! The location is in an office park, so not much traffic and lots of parking. 

They give a good 20% military discount too!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food, only live a few miles away but never even knew it existed until seeing it on the Yelp app. Complimentary Salsa and chips were good as were our enchiladas. My only complaint would be the cost of the margarita, yeah it was huge and tasty but $12 ?"}
{"text":"Good service.  Sat in the bar area since it was a lot quieter.  First up was the complimentary chips and salsa.  Salsa had a nice tang to it. For the appetizer we had the Cevichi which was very good, but could have used more shrimp.   I tried the Chile Rojo which came with about 7 soft shell tacos to wrap up the rice, refried beans and steak strips. Truthfully, for the amount you receive you probably only would need 5 tacos.  The meal had just the right amount of spiciness that it wasn't overpowering.  My husband had the Carne Azada which he said was a little tough.  Mango mojito was excellent!!  Wanted to have the fried ice cream, but they were out, so we didn't have dessert."}
{"text":"Tucked away on a street of office buildings, and in the same spot as what was formerly Clark's. Chicken quesadilla was fantastic, as were the steak and shrimp chimichangas! The bar has plenty of seating, and the bartenders were on top of their game during a Friday happy hour. Have only been open for ~2 months, but very clean. Very comparable to the Emiliano's downtown and in Cranberry."}
{"text":"FOOD IS AMAING and the bussers are friendly that's the only reason they aren't getting 1 star! The bartender Jordyn is the rudest female I have ever met we sat at a booth on Sunday day for lunch and the server hadn't arrived yet. There was Only one other table occupied  in the  entire restaurant and no one at the bar. Jordyn refused to take our order so we finally walked to the bar and ordered 2 drinks once she made them instead of bringing them to us she yelled UMMM and had us come up and grab them then once we wanted to order our food we had to walk up to the bar again because god forbid her highness make any effort at all! The buss boys brought food out in a vary timely manner and again it was amazing! Once we wanted to close our tab Jordyn again yelled for us to come grab our checks bc walking 15 feet to a booth is apparently not in her job description! 

Once the server came in we noticed the bar tender refused to make the drinks she would ring up (for the only other table In the whole restaurant) I personally have never seen a server treated so badly by a bartender it was extremely uncomfortable the only way this restaurant will succeed is to get rid of the negativity that is the bartender I want them to do well bc the food is so good but as long as I see her behind the bar I won't  come in! You can tell poor Jordyn is drains and sick of being a bartender and and believes she's entitled to tips just for showing up but a restaurant is only as good as its staff!!"}
{"text":"Some of the worst, overpriced Mexican food and margaritas we've ever had. Cute place with so much potential but just yuck. $12 for a margarita that was a mix when we specifically asked whether or not it was a mix, along with the fact that we couldn't detect a hint of tequila...totally unacceptable."}
{"text":"Love this place great food and great people. EEG always impresses with the best lighting and music in all of Scottsdale. Don't miss this new hot spot! It's amazing and sure to be a great night! Specials all the time and it's popping!"}
{"text":"Have you ever went to a place and you are like where in the world is it? But when you roll up your like \"Oh this spots gonna be good I just know it.\" Well yeah I got that feeling after finding out about this exclusive spot. They have delicious big margaritas go for $8 per and $5 per during happy hour. They have margarita flights which I highly recommend for a group of friends they're 3 for $15. The fresh salsa had a medium kick and good flavor,  house made chips were bomb just needed a touch of salt. Some of the best chips and salsa I've had in awhile I'd honestly buy it to take home. For my food I got a steak burrito that was topped with queso and ask for them to put a little guacamole in the burrito for a few bucks and the fresh guacamole makes it amazing. I've been there twice now back to back days after first trying it with friends who also loved it! They got the quesadillas and they were huge 12 inches!"}
{"text":"I've been to Casa Amigos a few times now and have loved it every time. I was hesitant the first time we went, because they had just opened but they excelled in quality of food and service. The tamales (off-menu) are home made, moist and delicious.  The ceviche is fresh and I could honestly order it and just eat it as a meal. If you're looking for a refreshing cocktail, try the Palomas.  They are a bit out of the way, but it's nice to get away from the Robinson shopping chaos/crowds."}
{"text":"When this place was first opening I was thrilled about.a Mexican restaurant in moon as I often find myself in that area however after a few visits since it's been open I am not sold on it. Every dish essentially tasted the same to me from burritos to tacos to fajitas none of the food Items were able to separate them selves for the others. Serves has been slow but that is not to blame on the bartenders as every time I've been there it is only one girl with no one offering her any help. I definitely thing management needs to start having more than one person on shift at a time. I also was not at all a fan of the margaritas the first one I had gotten there no only was the rim absolutely covered in salt it tasted as if they are blending copious amounts so salt in with the drink it's self I was not even able to drink it, the second time I went I ordered another one with an unstated rim and had the same problem with the drink tasting like pure salt. I will not be returning to this place any time soon."}
{"text":"First off, I've wouldn't have know about this place if the lady working the front desk hadn't said anything. Like a previous customer said it's hidden in the back away from the traffic located in a office building. I was so impress when we open the door we were met by the bartender she seated us upon arrival gave menu took drink orders and chatted with us off and on. Super sweet lady by the name of Debbie (crazy Debbie she goes by that name) debbie made me one of the and I do mean THE BEST margarita EVER!!!  everyone's food was amazing she loaded us with chips and salsa. I will definitely visit again next time I'm in town. Oh I definitely have to mention the food was Little on the pricey side for a standard Mexican restaurant. The most I've ever on an entree is maybe $15 bucks here your looking at $15 for a plate of tacos to $20 bucks for fajitas so definitely bring roughly like $30 bucks for dinner (that's for one person)"}
{"text":"My favorite new Mexican restaurant.  It has an excellent menu and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"What a nice place. Also a very nice and polite bartender. Highly recommend. I ordered the grilled fish tacos. They haven't come yet, but I bet they'll be delicious. Very clean, no nasty smells. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Food was good. Drinks were good but expensive.  The environment was great. The service was terrible at both Casa Amigo and Skylanes. 

It took about 20 to 30 minutes to get a drink from our waitress but just a few minutes from the bar. We were in the restaurant for over an hour and a half and most of my party could only get one to two drinks. The second bar was not open despite them bringing tour buses in from the Phoenix Open.  Several members of our party were overcharged. Maybe it's just me, but I hate that they charge 3% to use a credit card \"processing tech fee.\"

Skylanes was a lot of fun. However, the bowling alley had lots of technical difficulties and broke often. One of the lanes was closed for almost 20 minutes, which we paid for while they untangled the pins.  The picture below shows the pins wrapped around each other. It was interesting because they were all on strings. 

Again, the billing was a disaster. Most of our party was overcharged or charged for other people's purchases. My credit card and ID were left out on the counter in front of the cash register until my wife noticed it and said something to the staff.

I think that this place will be great once they work out the kinks. They need to get these people trained. It really seemed like they hired people new to the industry. 

In all, we had a good time but we're frustrated by the service and billing.  Some of the errors seemed intentional so it really made the whole place feel shady."}
{"text":"While I am always up for new restaurants Casa Amigos will not be going back. Waitress (never gave her name) never welcomed us as it was 1st time there or have specials for happy hour . Ordered and I did find something that I substituted chicken for shrimp which may have thrown the kitchen off a bit. Meal came out small portions not very filling. Waitress clearly had too many tables not very attentive. Will not be retuning"}
{"text":"Let me preface this post by saying they are new and I hate going to new places too quickly because they have to iron out all the kinks, and I understand that; so I'm going to go easy on these guys. 
They are in a previous location held by the old Clarks' bar and grill, so you can still feel that Irish pub ghost. They have tried to add a Mexican flavor as best they can. Not bad... clean modern bar, nice atmosphere. Glassware was perfect, that south of the border blown glass look. Bartender friendly but overwhelmed, couldn't keep up. She did her best though, and I think everyone ordering a frozen blended drink didn't help. Food was nice, how can you screw up fajitas?!?  Rice not bad. Beans not bad. Guacamole was on point. Everything was a solid 4 outta 5. Chips and salsa hit the spot. Nothing to buckle your knees, but delish enough for another trip back. Price points for middle of hidden suburbia.... too high. Probably do better dropping slightly. And this place is definitely hidden, Magellan would have a hard time discovering this spot. 
Service needs work but... again... we already discussed being brand new, they'll get it under control. I'll be back with an updated review!"}
{"text":"Jordan absolutely amazing today! She made my experience at Casa Amigos feel like I had been here a thousand times! Amazing ahi tacos and such a fun atmosphere! Look at the wall art and it will trip you out! I will definitely be back and i live in Chandler!"}
{"text":"This place was great! We went for lunch on a Monday afternoon. There was no wait and within a minute of sitting down they brought us chips and salsa. Our waiter was really nice. As far as the food goes, my husband ordered the enchiladas with the green sauce. They were delicious and a large portion. I ordered the lunch special fajitas. This is a great deal bc they were $10.50. The fajitas from the dinner menu are $16. It was still too much for me to eat so I will have some left overs. We had an overall great experience."}
{"text":"Extremely fast service! Great food. Guac could've been better but overall a good price for the quality."}
{"text":"service and food were fantastic. shrimp tacos= amazing. and margaritas were great too. waiters we fun and enjoyable. great experience"}
{"text":"...met the wife here after work for dinner without the kids. Tucked away in an office park and thoroughly enjoyed the place. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Good Food! Clean and decent drinks. Would definitely recommend to those staying at neighboring hotels. We didn't have to go far away at all for a good meal."}
{"text":"This restaurant offers excellent authentic Mexican food, drinks and service! We enjoyed everything we ordered from the margaritas to the queso dip to the fish tacos and burrito. It is in a hidden location which is the only downfall. Tucked in a business park/building. If you like Mexican food please give this place a try you won't be disappointed. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Due to work, I'm always traveling, Casa Amigos has a variety of food options and a full bar. Their specials are very good. The atmosphere was very nice, it was like being in another country, the music was perfect, not too loud nor too low. There was people, some locals, which that's always a good sign. 
The staff was very friendly and accommodating. Good Margarita's, (will have more) Food, very tasty and a big portion and they have a variety of desert options. 
Overall, I definitely recommend Casa Amigos, I'll be coming back. Customer service is impecable, everyone, specially our server Elena, Thank you for making us feel welcomed and at home. 
For a new restaurant ... they are great."}
{"text":"This place! Go here if you want strong drinks!  Derek with the amazing tattooed arms snd decent facial hair was our bartender.  They were very accommodating to 7 of us women (one being high profile)the drinks were strong and a decent price for a double.  The only thing I would change is the noise level.  We were there when it was slow then it got busier- at any rate we were able to communicate if we spoke loud enough."}
{"text":"Avoid this place if you can! Waitress was nice but the food was crap!  Extremely overpriced and not a great selection on the menu!"}
{"text":"Hospitality is unreal ! Stopped by with a bachelorette party and were comped champagne and a round of shots! Adriana was our waitress and was amazingly sweet. She had recs for everything ! Places to eat, where to go out... plus the food was toooo good ! Between us all we got a little of everything... guac is house made, burritos are delicious and they have quite a hefty drink menu. Music really set a vibe."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner and it was not very crowded probably due to location and a night early in the week.  Service was good.  We received some chips and salsa.  Really enjoyed.  The salsa had a little heat to it.  The chips appeared to be home made.  Ordered the Enchiladas Verdez that is 3 Green Sauce Chicken enchiladas with rice, lettuce, tomato, gauc and sour cream.  The green sauce was tasty but the chicken really lacked much flavor."}
{"text":"Definitely serves the best Mexican fare in Old Town. The place is vibrant, clean, and exciting. The decor is electric and the open garage door style windows let's in natural sunlight and fresh air. The staff is extremely energetic and friendly. Our bartender, I think her name was Jordan?, was so upbeat and friendly! I've never encountered someone so cheerful and forthcoming. The menu is larger than most Mexican restaurants, there were so many options. Luckily our bartender Jordan once again came to the rescue! Her intimate knowledge of the different meats, poultry, and pork helped make our decision much easier Jordan knows her meatsWe ordered the dry rub wings, the al pastor tacos, the Barbacoa tacos, and chips and salsa. None of it disappointed. This place gets 5 stars as a restaurant. Around 10pm it concerts over to a night club which is equally as good as the food they serve during the day. The music is an upbeat combination of hip-hop and EDM, everyone seems to be enjoying themselves. Night club also gets 5 stars. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ESTABLISHMENT AND specifically Jordan. If you're unfamiliar with Mexican cuisine, make sure you ask for Jordan and her knowledge of Mexican meats!"}
{"text":"Stuck in a hotel by the airport and can only eat Primanti's so many times. Mexican food is usually more miss than hit in a lot of places still, but I decided to give Casa Amigos a shot based on the fact that they had Chile Verde on the menu. 

The restaurant is nice and clean and obviously it used to be an Irish pub. The service was very friendly and attentive, I never had to wait for a refill. The Chile Verde was wonderful, tender lean chunks of pork that shredded easily with a fork, the tomatillo sauce was tangy with just a bit of spice and a large amount of onion. I asked for some jalapeño slices on the side, and they arrived quickly, no problem. The refried beans were bland, as I usually find in these restaurants and I never get too excited about Spanish rice, nor do I ever bother to eat it. Overall though, I was very happy and would definitely return."}
{"text":"Was impressed by the quality of the food. Much better than El Campesino. Enjoyed the carnitas tacos and will be back soon."}
{"text":"I love this place! Yummy food and drinks and Jordan was amazing - hospitable and polite... chatted with me and my girlfriends as we ate and truly enjoyed her. I recommend this place for a quick yummy bite. Had the carne asada tacos m- highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Walked in while the \"host\" laughed at us personally. Sat at the bar(it's new to be so i was excited to try a new spot!) sat at the bar for well over 20 min while o watched the \"bartender\" talk to some other customer that needed nothing. 

As a fellow bartender myself i finally decided to leave to get a beverage somewhere else. I don't want to give my money to people that can't put the effort into customers with money to spend!

Oh and as we left 20 min later i told The manager that the place was cool but they need to work in the service... management said \"you should of gone upstairs\" wow with the 10 people in your place..... ok good to know. 


Give this place 6 weeks tops! Who hires these people?"}
{"text":"I would leave -5 stars if I could.
The first mistake was coming to Old Town on Cinco De Mayo. The next mistake was coming to this abomination of an establishment. 

I did not even make it inside because I have never seen such steroid abusing, disgruntled, bi-polar, power hungry security staff in my life. 

The bootleg Johnny Bravo bouncer wanted us to pay $20 a male to go in the bar for the last 30 minutes. We refused and told him that it was ridiculous. The childish, uneasy bouncer got mad cause we used our first amendment right and disagreed with this proposition. He then told us we could wait in the regular line. At this point, I didn't even have to go in but my friends wanted to since it was a large group. 

My friend and I got over in the other line. The crusty Johnny Bravo/caveman hybrid was so childish and petty to the point that he actually SIGNALED his fellow Neanderthal.... I mean bouncer to come over, whisper in his ear like an elementary schoolgirl to tell him not to allow my friend in the bar. (I literally watched this grown ass man do this y'all, get mad we didn't want to tip him and tell them to not let my friend not to come in the bar.) My friend did not do anything except use his rights and disagree with paying. We are not obligated to give some dirty, filthy, steroid abusing homosapien our money. I could of gladly paid the $20 but I don't give my money to disrespectful, shitty people. 

Once my friend approached the podium, they then let him know to call it a night, and he had to leave. We then tried to peacefully reason with them and understand why because this is a bar and we do not have to pay that bouncer and he can't prevent us entry because we don't like him nor want to pay him. However, this is the nightlife world so of course all the piece of shit bouncers at this establishment bounded together and started ganging up on my friend telling him to leave. 

This is when it gets ridiculous.... one of the bouncers then PUT HIS HANDS on my friend, he pushed him and then grabbed his shoulders which he had NO RIGHT to do because my friend did not ever touch any bouncer. So of course out of self defense my friend pushes the bouncer's hands off of him cause he had no reason putting his hands on him to begin with! We started to walk away at that point but then of course another one of the anabolic testosterone abusers came running,  wrapped my friend from behind and BODY SLAMMED him. Mind y'all, my friend is 5'6 and weighs 170 pounds. The bouncer was at least 6'4 and easily weighed over 240 LBS. You're telling me your big, bulldozer ass felt that threatened by my friend?

After that, we then had to deal with the police who eventually let my friend go cause even they thought it was ridiculous that my friend was slammed. 

I hope this place gets shut down and a restaurant takes its place cause the Old Town nightlife scene is horrible. 

Old Town Scottsdale has proven once again it is a scum filled place that is RAN by scum as well. Bevvy is STILL the only bar in Old Town that will receive my business."}
{"text":"27 mins to get 3 margaritas on a tuesday night! 10% capacity.  How is it possible that the service is this bad??? Nothing else to say."}
{"text":"I realize we're probably not the clientele they're looking for, but it seemed to be our best option on this loud entertainment stretch to maybe sit in air conditioning and be able to talk to a friend we hadn't seen in a long time.

It was a hot Sunday afternoon.  Not sure if we were supposed to or not, but we found a booth to land in.  Were brought menus.  Husband got the house margarita, while I had a decent chardonnay.  Our friend was really hungry, and simply wanted some chicken taquitos minus tomato, and guac.  Despite the loud music, he was able to decipher that they could not possibly leave off any item, as everything was pre-prepared.  So he said bring it anyway.  Oddly enough, it seemed freshly fried and he liked it.  Simply scraped the tomato off and didn't touch the guac on the side.  Why they couldn't have spared the waste, we'll never know.  Weird."}
