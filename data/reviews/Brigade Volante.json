{"text":"Despite the inviting atmosphere and decor, the food is underwhelming and service is slow. The concept is good, but execution is poor. Skip this place if you're looking for a hearty, we'll cooked breakfast served hot and within a reasonable time. We were on a Sunday morning, the only people in the place, and it took 30-40 minutes for our food."}
{"text":"The best brunch place I've ever had in Montreal! Original concept, original brunch items with a little twist. I will definitely come back! Plus, all you can drink STARBUCK's coffee!"}
{"text":"The food here was really good, but the service was ridiculously slow.  We were one of two tables in the place, and it still took us more than 20mins to get our coffee. The  The food was good enough that I will probably give them another chance, but if you're after a quick and good feed, I just can't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Looking for a place for late afternoon drinks, we were lured to Brigade Volante by it's huge sunny patio.  One look at their menu, we decided to grab dinner as well.  They don't have an expansive menu - a choice of 4-5 appetizers and mains in total.  We basically ordered almost every dish to try  - 2 cold soups (gaspatcho and fresh green pea - $5 each), house poutine ($8), jumbo shrimps in a refried bean paste, cured salmon on beets and beef carpaccio.  For mains, we ordered the mushroom ravioli ($18) and jumbo sea scallops on edemame paste ($21).   Food was fantastic!  Fresh tasting and flavorful.  Couldn't be happier with this meal.  We ordered red and white wine at the waiter's recommendation, plus some pints of beer as well.  Apparently, it was the first evening that they were open for dinner service and hopefully not their last.  A fantastic place to enjoy a gourmet meal at a very, very reasonable price."}
