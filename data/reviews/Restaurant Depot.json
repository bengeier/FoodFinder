{"text":"Horrible customer service. Double check stuff when you buy from there. Sold old meat \"didn't expect a place like this to sell expire stuff\" Call and told them about it. They didn't really seem to care. Came back and return it they didn't have good customer service at all."}
{"text":"This store drives me absolutely crazy. It's so poorly managed. Every time we come here for the bar food it's always something. The product has no price or the price is old or its the wrong item and the wrong tag Seriously get it together and it's not like they are understaffed because there's workers everywhere that seem like you are inconveniencing them when you ask them to clarify. This is my last time here! Lost a long time customer, I would rather pay more money than getting aggregated!"}
{"text":"This place is spectular, this is a real whole sale club. Places like Sams club are kind of whole sale.  RD  has  a ton of choices and is the real deal. I got like 3 pounds of cleaned squid for 8 bucks. The pork tenderloin I bought was pretty fantastic as well. I purchased 3lbs of frozen spinich as well. I'm not sure what is going to happen to it but it should be interesting. They have everything you need to make your kitchen into lets just say a restaurant. My only peeve is they did not have samples, but that can be good cause some people can be real a-holes when samples are present. I would really like to have a nacho cheese fight,  with the low prices here that could soon be a reality. Don't worry no squid will be involved, unless you are into that type of thing."}
{"text":"Great prices & everything you need If you are a business owner in the food industry not open to the public"}
{"text":"This place has a crazy amount of stuff, and great deals if you are buying in bulk...sometimes. You still have to watch the prices.  Just because this is a whole-saler does not mean everything is priced perfectly 100% of the time. I do wish they had the aisles labeled as to what is where, it would save me, and I'm sure others, a ton of time from having to wander around the store. Also, the cashiers there....wow. We has a petite female that was nice to us, but I didn't care to listen to her talk to her fellow co-worker in a \"ghetto voice\" saying that she was going to beat him up in the parking lot. I can't remember the exact term she used, but it was kind of awkward. I'm thinking maybe she was joking with him, but I'm really not sure..."}
