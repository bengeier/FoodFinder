{"text":"Horrible attitude. Out of 4 of us, we left 2 pieces of sushi. They wanted to charge us 50 cents per piece. Seriously... why lose 15 dollar tip for one dollar.... and business."}
{"text":"Out of all the sushi places I have tried in the Mississauga/Oakville area, hands down they have the best fresh sushi. Loved the food. A lot of dishes in the menu. The curries aren't as great. But the fresh sushi and so many fresh grill dishes make up for it.  The staffs are very friendly!  And guess what?! They ARE HALAL!  My favorite ayce sushi place in Mississauga right now"}
{"text":"I'm actually surprised to see that this restaurant has low ratings. While they're not perfect, I've always had a pleasant experience here. The service is fast, food is tasty and their tasting menu is quite extensive. Being halal is a definite plus point as well and gives me the option to eat whatever I please, which is not often the case. I don't think I've really ever had anything here I didn't like, but I have seen less than friendly service. On occasion it has felt that waiting on the table has been an inconvenience for the wait staff but that is really the only complaint I have."}
{"text":"The sake is pretty good so is the sashimi dinner. You don't really need the AYCE since you have a lot of choices from the menu.  Very good sashimi and sushi. What else do you want from a sushi place?   Only one waitress and so don't have to worry too much attention. So if you are taking the AYCE route, you'd better make up your mind fast.   Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I have been to kk on several occasions. In general , the decor is nice, the rolls are fresh and adequate, good variety. but service is a hit or miss. During my last visit to KK Sushi, I ordered philly rolls, and when the philly rolls arrived they were accompanied by sashimi... or what ever the rice balls with the raw salmon on top is called. I did not order this  but already waited 20 min for any food to come out so decided i wouldnt return and have to wait more time for my rolls. At the end i did not eat 1 of the rolls.( I am very familiar with AYCE sushi places and understand that at times they do charge for any sushis that are not eaten), When going to pay ( after horrible service) I realized the charge for the sushi it was about $1.50. I didnt care and proceeded to pay by debit, but my boyfriend on the other hand obviously needed to say something. She mentioned we did not eat the ONE roll. I told her i realized that and will pay for it but they brought me the wrong order. Cutting me off she walks away from me and comes to me with the sheet that we used to order. ( Note that they offer u a paper with the items u can order you either check mark or but the number of pieces you want) There was a 6 beside that item and i apologized and said maybe i wrote beside the wrong one. After analyzing the paper a little further I realized that everything we had in order was marked with a blue pen( which they give you when you sit down) but that 6 was in a black pen. I DID NOT order that item, and was being charged for something that I did not check off.Server then started screaming at me infront of everyone, saying that im accusing them of cheating and it just became a huge issue.  They get three stars because the food is good, unfortunately the service convinces me not to go again. I work at a hotel right beside KK Sushi, and its unfortunate but they have lost A LOT of business due to this minor incident that could have been prevented by a charge of $1.50. I would still use them for delivery as that always seems to go fine, but I do leave it as my last option."}
{"text":"I was just here with my boyfriend earlier this week and I was surprised by how they've changed up the place. It's super nicely furnished now and the atmosphere is very nice to be in and whoever was in charge of music certainly had good taste! The maki's were very nice, and the quality of the rice and how it was cooked made me very happy (unlike a lot of places with the mushy rice stuff). Kitchen items were done on point, I was in love with the beef... I also like how they even have the options as to how you want it cooked. The service was way beyond expectations of both my boyfriend and I. Food was out pretty quickly and there was two ladies on shift that night and they were very pleasant and attentive, so our table was always clean. The quality of the sashimi was great! I wish I lived closer. For just over $20 a person, the food is great, service is awesome too. This is really one of the most underrated sushi places in Mississauga, probably due to the location being in the middle of an industrial area... Loved it! I'll be dragging friends and family here soon."}
{"text":"This is my go-to sushi restaurant when I'm at work - I'm at Dixie/Matheson, and there are 4-5 sushi restaurants very close by  While the other sushi restaurants are good, I find I frequent KK Sushi the most. Mainly because they have great prices, the staff is very friendly, and every time I go the sushi is always great."}
{"text":"this place is awesome ! the food is fresh and delightful, the staff is friendly and I have nothing bad to say about this place, I recommend it to everyone"}
{"text":"Went in for business lunch with client. Owner very nice, food is fresh and fast. Very happy!"}
{"text":"I went to KK the other day with a group of 6 people. I have been to tons of AYCE in the past ranging from super expensive to on the cheaper side but I think this is the one place i liked the least. For the rolls we ordered honestly some of them tasted like mush, they were also falling apart. For the other appetizers we ordered like chicken katsu, chicken teriyaki, beef enoki mushrooms, etc a lot of them were very bland and tasted like nothing. One person ordered some pineapple fried rice which she had to struggle to finish so I wouldn't recommend that. I was really disappointed since we each paid 22.99 i believe for lunch buffet that was very below average quality. Also want to point out that there are no drink refills and pop is around 1.50 to 2 dollars. The wait staff was pretty decent they were available, although we had to flag them down several times like to refill our empty water glasses, and the food came out promptly.  The dessert is your standard ice cream and they had a mousse cake which was pretty good (although we ordered 2 mocha mousse cakes and they gave us one of each flavour (3 in total). I saw some people include that a few items they ordered were missed which happened to us, but I've seen this happen at other places as well so I didn't knock off any points for that (we did order quite a bit lol). I wouldn't recommend this place as for the price the quality isn't very good. I was excited when I discovered this place through yelp but unfortunately after this experience won't be going back. Also of note there are some coupons on the take out menu/flyer and website. I inquired about these but they said they no longer accept them and they were for last year lol... might be time to update those then."}
{"text":"Terrible, even for AYCE sushi. Fish was mediocre-poor, as expected, but rice was undercooked, under portioned and oddly distributed throughout the roll, and rolls were loose/difficult to handle. A sweet sauce was indiscriminately applied over all rolls, undoubtedly to mask whatever unpalatable flavours might lurk beneath. Needed to specifically request wasabi, twice. Shrimp skewers were cold, ? Precooked and reheated? Squid was overcooked and consequently rubbery, lukewarm at the table and served with some heavy mayo sauce with surprisingly little flavour when I eventually tried it. You don't expect great service staff at such establishments, and this expectation was met without even an attempt at a smile."}
{"text":"For an AYCE, quality and quantity (portions) like a la carte.  Service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Friendly and quick service, but my rating went down because of the sushi quality. It just wasn't great but it was ok. A lot of things were too saucy. I also like my sushi cold.. and when the rice is warm it just doesn't taste as great. It kind of gets mushy in your mouth when it's warm. Still, it's a decent sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"Why bother advertising delivery, when they don't deliver?!? But instead ask you to come pick it up?! If I didn't want delivery, I wouldn't call for it! Would not eat or try calling for delivery again. Worst service ever."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday evening with three other people for their AYCE menu. I have to say we have definitely had better, but we gave it a shot. There were more than a few items that never made it to our table. If you like General Tao Chicken, don't bother ordering it here, it was awful. What did stand out for me though was the Kamikaze Salmon Roll because it was unique. Other than that, this place didn't have much to offer except that it's location was convenient at the time."}
{"text":"Walked out half way through the meal. All the sashimi tasted rotten and some pieces looked terrible. All the chicken and meats tasted old. The rolls tasted old.   Good service though!"}
{"text":"Very bad service.  We went in with group of seven, the waiter wouldn't allow my friend to have non-all-you-can-eat menu despite the rest 6 of us having all-you-can-eat. She commented rudely that she didn't trust my friend to stick to his non-all-you-eat menu. We tried to protest her comment as she was extremely rude but the waiter couldn't care less about customer service.  We looked around as we couldn't believe what had happened. No one from the restaurant tried to amend her rude attitude or comment.   We left the restaurant right away and we are never going back. I'm happy we found out their attitude before we spent money. I wouldn't want to provide this business my capital."}
{"text":"Excellent food  I went with my girl friends for a girls night. I ordered the mango salad and it was very good and the ginger dressing was perfect. For my entree I ordered the dynamite Roll and broccoli roll. The rolls were freshly made and heavenly. I will love to go back. The server barely spoke English.  I had a really hard time understanding her. However food came in a timely fashion. Reasonable pricing  Ambiance was nice"}
{"text":"These guys are unbelievable!!! DO NOT GO HERE!!  I ordered 8 piece spicy girl roll and when I got to work it was 6 pieces!! They charged me for 8. I called back to let them know but they kept arguing with me that they gave me 8 pieces... She confirmed with the chef and then claims she saw the 8 pieces herself... WHY WOULD YOU CONFIRM WITH THE CHEF THEN IF YOU SAW IT YOURSELF IN THE FIRST PLACE?! Their tempura is so bad and gross... Worst place to go too and they did nothing about it considering I go there a lot as it is close to my work so I have no choice... PLEASE LEARN TO KEEP YOUR REGULR CUSTOMERS HAPPY ATLEAST!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing place for sushi with great service in a great environment. The price is within range, whereas you get delicious food in a timely manner. You can always depend on consistent service and food quality considering we've been there multiple times in the last year. Would definitely recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for an all you can eat experience! Don't let the industrial look on the outside fool you!"}
{"text":"First time. Got there early, so no trouble getting tables together to seat a party of 9 for Mother's Day lunch. We opted for the AYCE.  First impressions were good: modern decor, clean, well staffed.  Service: once it gets busy, you do have to be proactive to flag down a staff member to take your order sheet. Very attentive to clearing dishes and re-filling water/tea. Only our salmon belly order didn't show up.  Food: appetizers (hot & sour soup, seaweed salad, green salad, mango salad, edamame) were ok. Sashimi portions were good. Maki rolls were tight and plenty of small quantity options (e.g., 4 or 6 pieces) on the menu. Tempura shrimp & veggies were lightly battered. Calamari was excellent. Banana tempura was just right.  Sorry, no foodie pics to post. The fam was that hungry and it was just that good.  Meh: deep fried chicken wings. satay sticks in desperate need of a dipping sauce. For groups of 8 or more, a 15% gratuity is automtically added to the bill.  Looking forward to providing an updated review in the near future."}
{"text":"Be careful when you go here, they charged me twice, once on my debit card then on my credit card after saying the transaction didn't go through. I tried to get them to reverse the charge after a couple of days when the transactions showed up on my bank statement,  I even showed them the cancellation receipt, however they refused and said they wouldn't do anything.   Ended up paying $150 for $40 of mediocre sushi. Not worth going to at all. Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"New favourite lunch place alert! Another Japanese restaurant to have lunch for a decent price.   But it's different. The food tasted fresher and of better quality, especially from my first take on it today.   The place is nice. Good atmosphere, you can even call it classy. White walls and furniture, and clean. It wasn't full for lunch, but I made a mental note to bring this place up for work functions or parties.   Their menu ranges from lots of different types of rolls (on my list to try next time), appetizers, sushi/sashimi, bento boxes, teriyaki and noodles.  No Short Ribs, but they do have an Unagi Don meal (all comes with soup, salad and rice, $13.25) Their bento boxes for lunch there were 2: chicken/beef + tempura + salad+ miso+ 2slice of orange + california roll ($12.50) OR the same thing + salmon or black cod ($13.25)  What was interesting was that that for almost every bento box you're paying an extra $3-4 for tempura and a california roll. You decide if that's worth it. The best deal would be the Black Cod ($12.00 meal only) and the Bento being an extra $1.50  I got a Nabeyaki Soba (good for them that they know the difference between Soba and Udon, unlike another restaurant in Mississagua) and my co-worker got a Bento Box.  I was told that the Teriyaki was really good, and the sushi rice soft. The presentation was really nice too.  My soba ($12.00) was yummy, a bit small, but just right. The broth was a bit salty, but tasted 'real' not msg'd. It was supposed to be assorted seafood and veggies. It had one Tempura, Semicooked egg, one Mussell, a couple crab legs, 2 surf clams, peppers, carrots, zucchini, one enoki mushroom bunch. Not bad, they could have skimped, but they didn't.   Yes it could have been cheaper, but for some quality food in a sit down restaurant, it wasn't too bad.  I'll definitely be back again.  I did find the service a bit slow, to get our food, but wasn't too bad. Finished in 45 mins.   The back corner booth has an outlet on the wall, for any business meetings that might want to happen here."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for AYCE sushi for 5 years as it's close by. The sushi and sashami is decent for the price. The service is usually good."}
{"text":"They have some pretty good maki rolls and the service is pretty quick. They forgot to bring us a few things we ordered but brought it out quickly when reminded. Also tried the sweet and sour chicken which was not bad- I would not recommend the chicken wonton soup it tasted and smelled like the chicken had gone off. Not the best sushi I've had but overall a pretty decent option (minus the soup) and would be open to giving it another try just because there are not a lot of halal restaurants like this. Also, the mocha mousse cake was quite delicious and very light."}
{"text":"In for a late dinner on Friday night and 3rd time was also a charm.   Yeaaaa for K.K. :)"}
{"text":"if i can give it ZERO stars i would.  TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVIC, the worst staff ever. i placed my order at 1, the driver called me maybe 8 - 10 times to ask about the address even though i live right behind square one and it's a very clear address. driver had VERY VERY poor english, i barely understood and this went on from 1 till 2.45, then he cancelled the order and went back to the restaurant without even giving me a freakin call!!!!! i called the restaurant to ask about my order and this informed me of this. Terrible delivery, wouldnt recomment it to anyone"}
{"text":"I've been coming to KK Sushi for years, excellent food, fresh, nice sashimi sizes, friendly service. L07b shown in picture, a combination of salmon sashimi, sushi and rolls, comes with miso soup and salad. free green tea."}
{"text":"Love the sushi ! Always fresh! Tasty and the sushi platters are always the best! Best sushi in the area. Especially when its all you can eat. I always recommend this place because its just so awesome !"}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday night for 2. Service was good for the most part. At one point we tried to get our dessert and the staff was having their own dinner in the corner and it was hard to get their attention.   Not very good food for Ayce. The Kalbi marinade was weak and overcooked. The sushi rolls were very large, falling apart, rice was hard. Sashimi did not taste very fresh. For $30pp.. Was expecting better food. Mango and chocolate mousse cake were terrible. Next time, I'll stick to heart sushi in mississauga. Overall, Poor quality food."}
{"text":"My friend was landing at Pearson after 2 weeks in Italy and we were all craving some good sushi.   Unfortunately, KK did not fit the bill.   We arrived just before a rush and therefore there are no excuses on quality and deliver.   1) Service is slow. Borderline intolerable. I ordered a Diet Coke. Took me 5 requests to get it.  2) Salmon sashimi: wasn't cut properly. The pieces stuck together and I ended up with a bone in my mouth.  3) kalbi: over cooked, fatty, tasted old.  4) lamb skewer: over cooked, flavourless, not fresh.  5) the salmon avocado roll and spicy salmon roll were good.   Overall I had higher expectations and they were not met. I definitely wouldn't come here again."}
{"text":"2nd visit to this location.  When we entered the restaurant, it had a weird moist odour which eventually vanished after a while.  The servers were friendly and quick.  Our food was good, better than most sushi restaurants these days. The sashimi was a hit, while the miso soup was extra salty, the chicken green curry was very thin in velocity.  The food portions were pretty decent, not too big and not too stingy.  The boys enjoyed the lamb kabobs a lot while the shrimp kabobs were on the never try again list.  When our desserts came, it was a hit and miss. Our sesame balls were hard, the ice cream were decent but I find the green matcha was a little strong for my liking.  Overall a good visit."}
{"text":"For some reason, we ended up here for dinner -I think on the recommendation that it was similar in price to another awesome sushi place I frequent, but at a much closer location. Well, needless to say I'd rather have traveled the extra distance, because this new choice was a misadventure.  Reading other reviews, I'm surprised to hear people found the food to be worth the price of AYCE. Our food tasted terrible; chewy kalbi ribs, burnt shrimp skewers, undercooked padthai noodles, & a pineapple salad that had an odd fermented flavour... We only finished half of what we ordered & didn't bother staying for dessert. I don't have much to say about the service, thankfully it wasn't as bad as some other reviewers have mentioned. Not too slow, even with a moderately even flow of customers. But still, the food was just poor and I wouldn't waste my time & money coming back to see if it was just an off night. The decor was nice, I'll give them that I guess."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place to anyone unless you have extra 30$ to spend. Food quality was pretty bad and I fish did not taste like fish, what it tasted like I'm not quite sure to be honest...just go ahead and waste your money!"}
{"text":"Ok... So I was so excited to try this place as I got to know they serve halal meats. And decided to go today for AYCE.  I ordered appetizers first, they were okay. I didn't like any of their kabobs. They were so dry and hard. Chicken nuggets were frozen, was done by first bite. Shrimp tempura and Calamari was okay. Then, ordered Maki rolls sushi.. oh my  all of their rolls has avocado on it! I think 8/10 items had avocado! So guess what? Doesn't matter it's shrimp or tuna or salmon; was giving quite similar taste for all sushi. And the main thing, sushi weren't tasty at all. Anyway I was so disappointed and as I went for AYCE; I had to order! Ordered Green Curry, had no salt. Told the server about it and she just took away without saying anything like it's a compliment. Then Tom yum soup was literally like full of raw spices and taste was I dnnw what was that! I returned that too. The worst part is, at the very last, I ordered sushi comes 1pc each. And found dirty tissue on the rice. It was underneath the shrimp! I dnnw why I wanted to try the shrimp only as I was loosing appetite to have rice anymore and saw the tissue!! Right away I called the server and showed the tissue, told her that I feel like vomiting and to cancel the rest of orders. You know what she told me? She told me it's my tissue!! They don't use tissue. I was like seriously?? Why would I call you to show that if I put tissue here?? Does it even make sense? Without saying sorry, she just blamed me! I was about to call the manager, but my fiance was super upset and disappointed. He told me not to bother and leave.  The worst place ever! Worst customer service and worst food quality! Will never recommend to anyone!!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars, I would. The person I went with got food poisoning, and I would have as well had I not dealt with things immediately after feeling queasy. Don't let the 5 star reviews and polished pictures fool you.  The fish was off, the rolls were falling apart, everything was covered in terrible sauces (one tasted like strawberry sauce with burnt sesame, the other was literally just thousand island dressing), and we waited half an hour before food was even brought to the table. Half our food was never brought at all, and instead we were given food we hadn't even ordered in the first place. The mango salad had bad lettuce, the miso soup tasted too sour to be normal, and did I mention the rotten sushi? Oh. Oh yeah, I did.  20.99 for lunch AND dinner just because the place is halal is an absolute joke. Don't waste your money on sub-par food that's gone off and is smothered in dressings bought from Costco. You can do better by going to Sushi 168 or Heart Sushi, anything is better than this place. Worst sushi I have ever had, the appetisers were nothing special, and I was not happy to spend 54 dollars on TERRIBLE food (they make you pay for extra pieces of food if you're not able to finish it all) only to literally flush it all away because it made me sick."}
{"text":"My first experience at KK has left me with very mixed feelings.  I went with some colleagues for lunch (4 of us) for the AYCE.  While the food was very enjoyable, the entire lunch was sullied by the overall experience.  The decor was pleasant and the place is quite large... too large to have only 1 sushi chef on staff.  I found it strange that the lunch & dinner AYCE were the same price, but we knew that when we sat down, so can't really complain.    We were given an order sheet which we filled out right away and gave it in, 10 minutes later the food started showing up and it was excellent!  We were pleasantly surprised with the food we got (appetizers, hot food, and 2 maki rolls).  But then we were waiting for the other half of our order (mostly the rest of the maki & sushi/sashimi)...   We waited, and waited, and waited some more, then finally asked the server where the rest of our food was.  \"Oh, it's coming\" she said.    After waiting 45 minutes without any food coming we called the manager, who apologized and assured us that she told the chef to make our order next.  Then we waited some more, and watched as the manager and other staff served EVERY other table besides ours (so much for our order being next).    After waiting another 1/2 hour (at this point we had been there over the 90min limit for the AYCE) we called the manager and told her we only got half the food we ordered, it had been 90mins and we needed to leave to go back to work.  She seemed quite irate that we were bothering her again and asked us what we wanted her to bring (without giving us any menu to look and see what they missed)... \"We want what we ordered!\", I told her.  So they brought out 3 maki rolls, 2 of which were already served to us, and told us that was everything (which it wasn't even close).  I'm not sure if they lost our order sheet or just decided that we had ordered enough food and didn't want to bring any more, either way we left after sitting over 2hrs and were still hungry.  Not the best feeling when you pay $23 for all you can eat and had wasted so much time out of our work day sitting and waiting for nothing.   I would've expected some sort of discount for our trouble but the manager was unwilling to do anything for us.  Needless to say I will not be going back anytime soon, and probably never again for AYCE (at least not on a busy Friday), but the food we did get was quite tasty."}
{"text":"I'm am vair sad to be writing this update. I came here again recently to treat a friend to a birthday dinner. KK Sushi, I raved about you, and you let me down. You made me look like a crappy friend, and I don't appreciate that.  The quality of the sushi has really gone downhill. I found it to be rice-heavy and much too easy on the fish. It was AIGHT. I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"enjoyed the AYCE on weekend nights and good selection for a reasonable price. Staff was well mannered and food came really fast. nice ambience too. don't order the Thai food; pad Thai tasted like it was cooked in ketchup. Other than that I was happy with my experience"}
{"text":"I have been here twice, as I just work down the road. Both times was with a group of coworkers. The food is decent however the service is NOT. I was told by one of the waitresses to sit at the other end of the table because I was having \"all you can eat\", and she didn't want others eating from my food. I was not happy... As I was there to socialize and enjoy the food... not be told where to sit. I will not be going there again, and do not recommend others to try this out."}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday for lunch as a party of seven. The place is white but very dimly lit, with blinds shut despite the low lighting. We were given one menu for the whole table, which we took turns looking at or peered over each other's shoulders, and they didn't seemed too concerned with that despite us asking several times. Service was also persistently bad through the whole meal, even though there were four other tables there. They didn't come to refill drinks, and waiters/waitresses were short with us when we ordered or asked for the bill.   I got the salmon teriyaki don for $11 (after tax), but it was unseasoned and terribly bland aside from the thick, pseudo-Teriyaki sour sauce it came in. The vegetables it came with weren't fresh, and tasted like they were boiled without anything added to it. The only saving grace was that there seemed to be a considerable generous portion, though it didn't taste good at all.   I don't think I'd come back. I'd rather go to the Popeyes or the Burrito Boyz nearby. Save your money."}
{"text":"The sushi was ok, the other food was meh, and the choices weren't great. But worst of all was the $20.99 for lunch. Are you kidding me? Because it's Halal? This price is absurd for this quality of sushi when u can get excellent AYCE for 10.99-11.99 for lunch."}
{"text":"I'm a new sushi eater, but I do have to say the food at this restaurant was not the best. I would definitely not recommend this restaurant for new time sushi eaters! We went around dinner time and there was almost no one in the restaurant. The service was quick but the food was not the best."}
{"text":"After this weekend's experience here, I know why I hadn't come back after my first visit. Like other reviewers have mentioned rolls were falling apart, ribs lacked flavour, some food didn't come at all and pieces of sashimi are fairly small. It's definitely not worth the $25.99 per person on a weekend."}
{"text":"Shocked at the low rating at this AYCE place.  The staff here is great.  Amy is awesome!!! I work nearby so I order take out more than dine in.  My special request is \"no wasabi and ginger\"  Only 2 times have they made an error out of the many times I have ordered from here.  Its a good feeling when you call in and they remember you.  When its really busy they will take my payment on my next order.    Anytime I book a dining... they make sure my guest and I are welcomed and staff is attentive.  Service is fast and lots to choose from.  Everything is fresh and made upon ordering.  Modern and clean decor.  Plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Nothing special to mention, the sushi is sub par. Wait times are horrendous, & the wait staff is oblivious to the customer's complaints while inside the restaurant. We ourselves had to remind the server for soy sauce/ chopsticks/ plates/ & ginger & wasabi. The only thing working for them is the location. I will never return & I urge you all to spend your precious time & money elsewhere."}
{"text":"I am giving this place 3.5 stars.  A while back, my longest-serving student had a lunch with fellow interns. She was here for all-you-can-eat sushi (she can eat like there is no tomorrow) and said that it was okay.  Our team has lunch out every Friday, but you aren't obligated to go each week. Last Friday, it was KK Sushi. We were a group of five.  I looked at the menu online days before our outing. It was difficult looking at what was a scanned version of the takeout menu. I can't do a stuff-your-face-till-you-pass-out joint too frequently. I was pleased that there were lunch specials. I saw ramen and went with it.  We got there before noon and sat at a booth. We got menus, as we had all indicated that we wanted the lunch menu.  I had eyed the ramen. The seafood one with an egg looked interesting. However, the fake crab meat in the photo prompted me to do the chicken.  I wasn't sure how big the portion sizes were, so I ordered veggie tempura to start. I also got a Diet Pepsi, which came with a lemon wedge.  Our orders came quickly. I got my veggie tempura quickly. I got two pieces of yam, two pieces of broccoli, a piece of zucchini, and one piece of carrot. They all were crispy with the light tempura batter. You got huge florets of broccoli. I had already eaten a quarter of a broccoli head at this stage.  My ramen came next. The size was generous. I could have done without the tempura. Again, there was more broccoli in it, so I had consumed at least half a broccoli head by the time I was done.  My food was hot temperature-wise. I should have let all my food cool down a bit.  I had the option of going with either a soy or miso soup base. I never was offered that choice and ended up with the former. I like both, so it wasn't a huge deal. It would have been nice to have been asked, though.  My ramen tasted good. I wasn't expecting a separate plate with my crispy chicken with a light teriyaki sauce. So, it wasn't exactly what I had envisioned to get. Still, the noodles were perfect and the chicken was delicious.  Our boss came in late. He did not like his sashimi plate. He first said that his miso soup tasted odd. He then said that his sashimi wasn't fresh.  My student also ordered ramen, but the beef version. She felt the same way as I did -- yummy, but the separate meat platter was dfiferent.   My colleague who was next to me did a sushi roll special and liked it a ton. Our other colleague had a huge teriyaki bento box. It looked good. He polished it off, which meant that he was happy.  I would like to come back and give more of the menu a try. It was odd to see a sign when I first walked in that said that there was a delivery pick up area. I think it means that you pick up your food for takeout.

{"text":"Great bang for your buck. They do not have lunch and dinner combined as all day they have one menu on a fixed price. Great quality sushi and the calamari is a must try! Clean environment with lovely staff."}
{"text":"Love this place. My friend and I eat here every week. The service is great, food is amazing- high quality fish, and it's cheap. Though I wish they would update the menu a little bit, introduce some new sushi and other items. But overall, LOVE IT HERE!"}
{"text":"Warning: There is no AYCE buffet lunch here for $8.99  The sign from the outside makes it appear as though there is an AYCE lunch buffet for $8.99, but if you look closer it actually doesn't say that at all.  It says AYCE lunch, and then lunch special for $8.99.  The food here is alright, I've had better to be honest.  The prices are average nothing special.  I would recommend trying this place out to see for yourself.  It mainly caters to business lunch crowd during weekday lunch hours."}
{"text":"Way overpriced at $24 pp lunch. Rolls were good but the sashimi and sushi wasn't very good. The only good thing really was the miso soup. The BBQ eel sushi was gross, like it had been sitting out for days. I actually couldn't keep eating and felt quite sick after."}
{"text":"ouch this will be a painful review and maybe one of my lowest reviews on yelp. i was told it is fairly new so we can use that as an excuse for the poor experience we had. the two waitresses had to take on a full service night so basically there was no service for us. They missed about 40% of what we ordered off the AYCE menu. things like napkin and water request were forgotten. kalibi and all the bbq meats were burnt to cancerous levels. they have some work to do but eventually they should get it. overall a very crappy experience but im not going to say its my last visit but i think i'll wait a while before coming back. on a positive note, it's a really nice looking place and very reasonable $21 AYCE"}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service. We go here all the time at and work and no complaints at all"}
{"text":"meh..my opinion worsened since last time.. the food was not bad, the service was..hum..ok.. (yeah the waitress was slow even though there wereonly  4 other people in the restaurant at dinner but HEY! it was ok:))  But the price...for all you can eat..$23? and let me tell you, its not that much that you can eat:) I mean Mandarin in the same price range offers muuuch more variety and options of different cuisines. This place doesn't have \"exceptional\" Sushi menu if you ask me, definitely I have seen better for cheaper. so I don't think I would go back.. ta-da! P.S. Got my kid nuggets, eww:) they taste as if they are mcDonalds nuggets coated with extra breading and deep fried again:) I know it's not a \"Japanese\" meal, but if you have it on the menu, it has to be good. just saying.."}
{"text":"It's not cheap, but good sushi rarely is. Adequate portions, friendly staff, great salad to go with delicious maki rolls."}
