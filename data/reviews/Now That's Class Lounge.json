{"text":"Nice place for a rock bar.  The neighborhood is reasonably decent, there's a lot of parking around on the street (huge church in the next block that's obviously not in session during the shows).  The back patio is pretty sweet to hang out with a beer in the nice weather.  Show space is sizable.  Bathroom, or at least the women's bathroom, could be improved but it works for what you need a bathroom for.  There's also a bar next door that keeps the block pretty busy in the evenings and reduces that \"walking down the deserted street to your car at 2 am\" vibe.  I'm happy to see places like this operating on the West Side, thus reducing the need to drive to Coventry, University Circle area, or other easterly places."}
{"text":"The scuzziest of the scuzz-punk bars. And I wouldn't have it any other way. Great place to see wasted youth and chair slamming.

Stay for Mr. California's Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"A living hell. All the workers are grouchy bitches, they're boss is some cross dresser named Baby Jane, it's nice that the owner hires mentally deficient girls, but they shouldn't be serving drinks. I think I caught the flu from some guy drinking Wild Irish rose 3 broken stools down from me. I've felt more comfortable taking a crap at the New Orleans Greyhound station on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"I seriously love Now That's Class.  Even on nights when the crowd/bands aren't my thing, I really admire the variety that this venue offers.  I have seen some really great shows here and I have eaten some really amazing food here.  Really cheap drinks as well as a wide variety of fancy stuff, vegan slop night on Tuesdays and vegan brunch on Sundays, free video games, lots of familiar faces.  I feel like people judge this place way too harshly and maybe a little too much at face value.  This is a dive with personality that plays a vital role in the music and bar scene in Cleveland- everybody's not gonna love it, and even the people who do aren't going to love it every night, but it's undeniable that there's no place like it in town."}
{"text":"Now That's Class not only is a punk bar to see shows, but it is also a great place to eat if you are vegan!  Crystin and Nathan serve vegan Philly  cheese steaks, mac n cheese and potato salad on Tuesday nights from 9-?  (when food runs out).  On Sundays from 6-9 they have a vegan pizza party featuring pizzas and calzones and usually a salad.  They bar always has mexican food (provided by the west side market) and other items that Nathan cooks up for the bar (including vegan chili, curry lentils, bbq tofu skewers, etc).  Great place to eat, drink and see shows!!"}
{"text":"i lived right down the street when it opened nearly five years ago and remember my first night djing there with ralf.  this place is half cheers half star wars cantina.  saw & played countless memorable shows here, a piece of cleveland forever.   thin lizzy on the jukebox, loose-pourin bartenders, and skate ramps in the show room.  finally, someone is thinking of the children"}
{"text":"I am ashamed to say that I just this week stopped in. I have heard rave reviews for the past 2 years, but I was also horrified by a story a friend  told me involving a supersoaker filled with urine and a drunk kid spraying patrons on NYE 2007. I think that being sprayed with urine from a supersoaker would ruine my life as i know it. Anyways, I love this place; it is NOT the sort of place that should scare you. The super soaker incident was clearly isolated and unfortunate. They even serve vegetarian chili. There is a decent beer selection and the cheap cans are only $1 from 6-9pm for happy hour. I feel awful that I have missed out on 2 years of patronage."}
{"text":"Probably the best dive bar in Cleveland. Yeah, it may not be unique on the surface, but what dive bar is? Thats not the point. In my opinion, dive bars should be like a small shitty version of Cheers. Everyone knows your name, and probably goes there at least 3 times a week.

Shows are regular, cheap and local. Not your cup of tea? Alright, but its not really something to lower a rating for. You get what you should get at a dive bar. Blue collar rock of all forms to the max.

If you don't like it for being a dive bar and having a narsty sound system with almost-too-raw bands playing, than you kinda went to a burger joint for filet mignon."}
{"text":"The dirtiest bar I have ever been to.  I can't believe there has been a health inspector there in years.  Place is falling apart with graphic sexual graffiti on the walls.  Looks like nothing gets a daily wipe down.  Would only drink canned or bottled beer.  God knows how dirty the glasses and taps are."}
{"text":"This is a dive bar paradise. I fell in love as soon as I walked in. The bartenders aren't dicks and know how to pour a good drink. You might catch the hep from the bathrooms, but that's part of the charm."}
{"text":"The bartenders don't ignore you, the interior is what'd you'd expect. The touring bands and indoor skate park make this place unique."}
{"text":"Definitely not a bad place, as long as you know what to expect! 

It's pretty obvious that most of the patrons are \"punk,\" and most of the music is, as well. I happened to go on a night when the music was not punk music so I had a good time, but my first trip there, I kind of hated the music and it killed it for me. Could just be me, though, and if you like that music, you'll have fun! 

It was pretty clean when I went there but also not super busy. They have a nice front patio and a back space, too. The concert area is fairly small but good if it's not crowded.  Cool decor and even some skate ramps, which is neat. Overall, not a bad place."}
{"text":"Best bar in Cleveland hands down. Cheap booze, a gig every night, the ultimate jukebox and gnarly quarter pipes to skate. The home of punk in Cleveland. Join the fam"}
{"text":"Hey- kid: don't look down your stuck-up nose at me....I was wearing safety pins in my ears before you were born.  Drop your attitude and quit buying your \"punk\" clothes from Hot Topic.  Too bad good bands play there."}
{"text":"It's difficult for me to pin down exactly how I feel about Now That's Class -- on one hand, I love that cheap and delicious vegan and vegetarian food is the norm, on the other hand, I hate how every show I've ever been to has started and ended absurdly late (there have been nights where I've seen shows in Columbus and made it home earlier than I've made it home from Now That's Class) and how the sound tends to be muddy at best (likely a combination of mid-range sound equipment and bad acoustics.) Additionally, since the stage shares a room with a quarter pipe, you sometimes have to keep an eye out for errant skateboarders (the first time I ever saw a show at Now That's Class, I saw someone get kicked in the head by a kid that had lost control of their skateboard.) That said, Now That's Class books a wide variety of obscure bands (both local and traveling) and shows are always cheap, so if you're in the mood to catch a show and have something to eat without spending a lot of money, Now That's Class isn't a bad place to check out.

As for me, I prefer to go to Now That's Class for dinner on a Sunday evening instead of heading up there in the middle of the week for a show. They offer a number of specials on Sundays, including vegan pressed sandwiches, pizza, and a \"small plate\" (a mini, cheaply priced entree that varies each week -- the last time I was there the small plate was cornmeal crusted BBQ tofu.) While I wouldn't count Now That's Class among my favorite places to see a show, I would definitely list it as one of my favorite places to get root beer and a vegan cheesesteak with friends before returning to the working week."}
{"text":"I like this bar. Hole in the wall, good patio, good bartenders, clients that live on the fringes of society, eclectic live shows...all good things. But it loses 2 stars because the liquor selection is poor (no good dark rum i.e Sailor Jerry or Kraken, etc) and the place REEKS of piss. And I mean bad. The culprit is the mens bathroom. PLEASE just hose that fucker down with bleach. Its unbearable anywhere within 20 feet of the door and literally reeks the entire bar up. This isn't an ambiguous piss odor. This is a flat out stench. Get a bottle of Sailor Jerry behind the bar, hose down the bathroom, that is all folks, and I'd be there several times per month quietly minding my own biz at the bar and spending money."}
{"text":"Shittiest bar I've ever been to. Cheap beer. They have bartenders. Also liquor. Come on by."}
{"text":"I actually love this place, but the bathroom is a travesty (soap at least, but no running water in the sink), the airconditioning is lame, and the music room sounds like shit (maybe the band is to blame, too)....it's kinda cramped because there are ramps for skating all around, and I really don't know why the band I watched didn't play on the stage, and took up half the floor instead, but he whole gig was just akward and uncomfortable. 

The drinks are decent, the crowd is fairly friendly (tolerant, at least), and the bartenders are good at keeping everyone filled up. Hopefully I can come back and try the food."}
{"text":"I used to live right down the street. Haven't been back since I lived in the area. I enjoyed myself here on a few occasions when I knew a few of the bands that would play. Honestly, most of the bands that play here aren't my thing anymore -- but still, good on NTC for being here and doing what they do. 

Pretty decent beer selection. Food wasn't too shabby either -- and you'd probably love it even more if you're vegan or vegetarian. 

They used to do some fun events like spelling bees, trivia night, movie screenings, karaoke (Dennyoke!) -- not sure if they still do. 

I love the mural that's left on the wall from the gay bar that used to be here. Totally hot."}
{"text":"In Cleveland, as the five stars indicate, this is as good as it gets. Now That's Class Lounge is a typical punk rock bar with a ton of live shows. The size and type of crowd varies from night to night. A definite plus is that the bar is somewhat separate from the main performance area so one can relax at the bar without going deaf. The prices aren't bad and the beer is not as bad as people say. Most people there drink the crap beer to save money but the bar does carry better beers such as Tremens and La Fin Du Monde. They also have a little food in case you want to have a snack before you start your drinking. Vegetarian friendly as well. Now That's Class Lounge will not wow you but it is the best bar in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Saw a bag of Ruffles fall out of a crackheads dress when she picked her wedgie at this bar. Lots of great beer, real good vegan/veg/meat food.  Always some sort of entertainment/food/unique event/retarded party/idiot local causing a scene at this bar.... always a good time. VIP section for the regulars, great outdoor patios. Can Bar out back.... so you don't have to listen to the band and you can smoke your cigs if ya need to."}
{"text":"I'm not really sure what to make of this place yet.
it's super super grungy.. like to an extreme. 
I'm just here for the delicious homemade vegan food.
I really don't fit in with the people who are regularly here. I walk in all confident, and then the longer I stay the more ridiculous I feel. drinking helps alleviate that of course, but the thought is always there. 
it's alright. the delicious vegan food makes up for it. 
the music is always friggin weird tho. don't really know what to think of that too. it's sounds like experimental music all the time. which basically is just noise. i mean yeah everything is noise, but it sounds like just noise, not music...
anyway, i'll be back here tuesdays. like the other dude said, don't know when veganism and punk rock became a thing but whatever."}
{"text":"Cheap booze. Good music. Great live shows. This bar keeps it real. One of my favorite."}
{"text":"Came on tour and a year later I still think back on the gig fondly. One of the coolest venues in the midwest. There's a friggin' half quarter pipe in the room where the bands play. Highlights: Ate a solid vegan cheesesteak. Drank some cheap booze. Management was friendly/accommodating. 

Now That's Class rules."}
{"text":"My first visit to NTC did not disappoint. Drunk lady passed out on the bar? Check. Intoxicated crackheads advocating keeping other crackheads out of the bar? Double-check. Girl from a band brushing her teeth in the bathroom? Triple-check. Dirt cheap drinks and a random, indoor skateboarding ramp? All the checks. 

The bartender was a sweet little lady with an English accent. Go see her on Wednesdays and she'll take great care of you. The riff-raff was on point and quite entertaining, yet she handled it with poise and grace. Just about the only thing I didn't like were the guys who smelled the entire bar up with body-odor, slinging racial slurs in Italian like it was A-OK to be an a-hole. Nope. But they aren't the regular clientele. 

Can't wait to come back to this divey piece of awesome."}
{"text":"Seen two shows here: A Wilhelmina Scream and Teenge Bottlerocket. Will be back for more! Cool venue, skate park and bar.

Everything however, is a crumbling dive."}
{"text":"Cool dive bar checklist: Cheap beer, punk rock bands, vegan food, and skateboards? Yup. This place has it all."}
{"text":"Like all dive-bar \"paradise scenarios\", there is a catch with this one as well:  \"Now That's Class\" would be great except for the people that go there and the people that work there.  

Some very fun and worthwhile music comes through this venue, in all fairness and though the neighborhood in which the bar resides ranks barely above Beirut in terms of safety - the sound is decent and it still can be worth putting up with, despite the following typical pitfalls:

Did you happen to innocently glance at the bartender lady while you were chatting with your friend?   Well, that's too bad, because it turns out she's a delicate, easily-enraged prima donna and perhaps increasingly bitter about being past her prime and working HERE, so tough luck.   In fact she's ALREADY pegged you to the other bartenders as a \"troublesome creep\", despite your consistent politeness and excellent tipping.   You're an \"outsider\", after all - so just watch your step.   

Snickering poser idiot wearing an oversize leather jacket (in 80 degree weather) standing inches behind your friend - making a very visible point of eavesdropping with loud disapproval - on your PRIVATE conversation?   Tough Luck:  It doesn't matter that he's WAY in the WRONG and you are totally minding your own business - you simply don't LOOK   \"Rock\" or \"Punk\" enough for him - so he will engage in hostile, cowardly, antisocial behavior towards you the rest of the evening.   Ha ha. There is nothing you can do about it unless you want to go all the way (easily) and even then, can you guess who the locals and the staff will back up?  That's right, they'll back Chad.  Yes, it is unfair and it's infantile, I know.  Just marvel at it for a bit, laugh if you can - and move on.

In closing, are you someone who just wants to see your friend's band, are civil, decent, someone who moderates your drinking and is successful most of the time and doesn't bother anyone?  Well, that's a trick question because it doesn't matter here, folks. Ha ha ha ha.   The inbred, self-important creeps who inhabit and work this bar - will not give you the barest amount of civility because you are not part of their sad, posturing, appearance-obsessed loser community of smug, hygiene-challenged, hip turds.  Sooo just be thankful of that very fact and avoid this painfully self-conscious hellhole -  unless  1) absolutely necessary and 2) you have undergone the appropriate sedation."}
{"text":"A punk rock dive bar, with indoor skate ramps, cheap cold brews, and serves great vegan food. What's not to love?"}
{"text":"V cheap drinks. Good overall crowd for a divey place. Good techno music. Bathrooms are not the best but is expected"}
{"text":"All my best memories (and the nights I cant remember hah) are thanks to this shitty little paradise. Awesome beer prices, kickass shows, bizarre conversations to have and weirdos to party with. Vegan nite on tuesday is soo delicious. And now on Wednesday's Richard makes incredibly delicious handmade pupusas on a little griddle! 

 I love when they have random themed parties like the luau party forever ago with a hottub the parking lot! And fun stuff like sweatpants sundays.  Horrible fest was what we all looked forward to every year...this year its called \"not horrible fest\" haha. But I'm sure itll be super rad either way. Bartenders make strong ass drinks and treat you like an actual human bean haha...and drink specials are always on point. Ya cant beat 4 dollar shots of good bourbon either. Oh, and the jukebox is amazing too."}
{"text":"Skateboarding welcomed with their indoor ramp. Live music in the basement. This is a place for me."}
{"text":"Visited from Chicago, as I grew up in the CLE area. Took my son to an all ages show. We loved the place. Great size. Sound was decent, but the atmosphere and general vibe of everyone there made me proud to be from the Cleveland area. The half pipe in a venue is not to be missed. Seeing shows in Cleveland shaped who I am today and I believe this venue does the area proud."}
{"text":"Met up with some old friends here and they have great beers and whiskey to drink.  If you dont like this place your a dick....  I dont know when veganism and punk rock came together but whatever.  I leave that up to the college kids and hippies.  The lyrics to \"College Boy\" by Sheer Terror sum it up the best.   You will hear everything from Mr. California to Parkers west coast hip hop here.  Its always a blast.  Ill just bring a pack of raw hot dogs in and eat em on the shitter next time if I get hungry...."}
{"text":"Holy shit! I can't believe Rated R.'s review complains that coloreds are allowed in and that they must be all scheming to rob all the nice white people."}
{"text":"NTC books awesome shows and have they have awesome vegan food.  Tuesday nights rules, vegan cheese steaks and vegan mac and cheese dirt cheap and delicious.  This place is the diviest of dive bars which is a good thing."}
{"text":"The perfect 'punk rock' bar, not just by Cleveland standards. I had a blast here watching a band - not in the side room because it was just like being in a Kent basement watching a loud ass band. There is even a cool back patio for the smokers, well...it's more like a lot, but it still keeps that being at home feel.
They offer the requisite $1.50 brews and a host of other options, though I only saw people drinking canned beer. Ran into an old friend passed out on the bar, so things haven't changed in the past 20 years at all."}
{"text":"We went to see Off With Their Heads the other day and had a great time. I've always been a fan of the skate ramps you can sit on during a show. Very cool.

The sound is good for such a small venue and I always have fun when I'm here. Of course the bathrooms could be better but that's true of most small punk clubs. Am I right or am I right, eh? 

NTC has a fair beer selection at good prices. Overall, one of the better small venues."}
{"text":"I've got mixed feelings about Now That's Class.  

On the one hand, there are few places left in Cleveland that carry on the torch of the long lost art commune/performance space/party center of Speak In Tongues.  Not only do several SIT mainstays work the bar and soundboard at Now That's Class, but I believe much of the PA system actually used to be installed at SIT.  Beyond that, not many places are willing to book as many obscure/unknown acts form around the counrty and the globe as NTC is - another call back to the glory days of SIT.   In that regard, this is a great place to have in Cleveland (or anywhere).  

On the other hand, NTC embodies many of the lesser aspects of a good old-fashioned punk club.  A general sketchiness combined with awful awful (yes I meant to write that twice) bathrooms.  The neighborhood also has some issues, and I have had friends and acquaintances robbed at gunpoint when leaving the club.  This isn't necessarily NTC's fault, but it's something to keep in mind if heading down to see a show.  

That being said, anyone who is clued in enough to come to see a show at NTC is probably well acquainted with rock clubs in marginal neighborhoods anyway, right?"}
{"text":"Went to this place Friday 25JAN around 7-8pm. It was darker inside than it was outside!!! Really, the only way I could find the bar was by the light of the two people on their laptops sitting at a table! I love going to vegetarian places, so this was a HUGE disappointment!!! After waiting a few minutes for service at an empty bar I left. 

NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Make no mistake Now That's Class ain't a high falutin' Live Nation venue. This is a first-class punk rock dive. Patrons can always count on the beer being cheap, and the band being loud.  As a music venue, I can tell you that it's a step above bars in other cities that book the same shows. The big stage and legit lighting rig gives a real performance aesthetic to any band, no matter how few people they draw. That said, don't expect a mind-blowing aural experience out of this sound system, but then again you won't see the Cleveland Philharmonic here. Just hope the band you've go to see is touring with a decent sound guy. 

I have yet to try the food here.  Once I do, I'll update this review."}
{"text":"Jesco White the Dancing Outlaw performed here this weekend. Probably one of the best shows ever."}
{"text":"Typical punk dive. Crappy beer, crappy sound system, and crappy neighborhood. Those are the good points. The bad points: it's not original and punk/noise bands bore me to tears. But on the rare occasion they book a good show here, it's cheap and close to my house. Kudos for the veggie friendly vittles. Shine on you filthy, urine-soaked diamond."}
{"text":"A dump that sucks.

The youth are taking longer to grow up, still shitting where they eat. How long before they are back in diapers before ever having done so? A million places like this have come and gone, and eventually, this one will go. And when it does, how many assholes who puked on the bar or pissed on the floor will lament it's passing?"}
{"text":"Xmas eve and im here, end of 2015. Nowhere id rather be. Embedded smell of partying in the air, tunes mellow as can be. Merry Xmas! Til next year."}
{"text":"This bar belongs to a guy (Paul Schlachter) who used to roam the streets of Kent with a megaphone accosting whomever would step into his radius of sound. He's also a part of the (now sometimes reformed band?) \"The Darvocets\".

Upon my last visit to Cleveland I was happy to hear that Paul had decided to step into the small rock venue arena and open \"Now That's Class\". The non-smoking bar is welcoming with it's high ceilings, movie screenings and small stage. The jukebox is filled with punk rock greatness and the hits just play on and on... the bar is basically a cornucopia of entertainment! 

If you don't want to watch bands play, you stay on on the \"bar side\" and get treated to stiff drinks, an insane variety of beers and friendly staff. If there aren't any bands playing, there's a quarter pipe set up on the \"stage side\" for your cold, snowy indoor skateboarding needs. This place is great to meet friends, have conversation and, well, GET DRUNK! (Yep, it happened to me).

And yes, you can see Paul behind the bar holding the place together. The man has aged gracefully and has managed to hang on to his megaphone for business purposes... \"last call\" will never be the same! Thanks for the good time, guys...

PS: Touring Bands - contact them for more info on the venue and how to book a gig there."}
{"text":"Nothing says Sunday Funday like a good Vegan brunch.  NTC has one of the best of them!

We were greeted by Louis CK on the huge projector screen and little bits of paper that helped guide us towards the perfect vegan Bloody Mary (btw, can vegan and bloody really be used in the same sentence?).   I ordered mine with a salad; a whole stalk of celery, pickle, olives, okra and some vegan beef jerky that tasted suspiciously like jerky.  The Bloody was delicious and they had plenty of options for hot sauce, wasabi, etc.  

For \"brunch,\" which, btw, starts at 3pm like a good rocker bar's brunch should, I ordered the BBQ Tofu.  Served warm on a ciabatta bread, I was very pleased with it's BBQ/Buffalo sauce taste.  Most everyone else at my table got the sausage, egg and cheese sandwiches which again, tasted suspiciously like sausage, egg and cheese sandwiches.  It makes me wonder what's in normal sausage that makes it so easy to mimic without meat.  I think that's the point?

The sides all looked good and my only complaint is that maybe I wasn't exactly feeling $5 worth full, but then again, I'm not exactly well versed on the price of vegan meats and tofus.  Having another Bloody...or two, helped, and then we played Mortal Combat to further distract us from the fact  that we had that \"not so full\" feeling.  

Anther side note: It may smell a little strange and be a dive punk bar but it's really not that bad when it's day-time and the lights pouring through the glass block windows.  I was pleasantly surprised!  I think I may be partaking in their vegan fare more often and not just using NTC as an occasional stop on bike-night."}
{"text":"This is a place that I have been to once during the daytime, and it is a place I long to go to when I feel the need to pinch myself out of a cubicle woolgathering."}
