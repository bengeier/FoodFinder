{"text":"We went there for dinner. Ordered chicken65 and my piece had some white thread like things stuck to the skin... 65 tasted more like fried chicken....We returned the dish. 
Ordered American Chopsuey and the chicken was smelling. Returned that as well. Manager said that's coz it is brown ckn.... 
I will never return there!!!!
But thankfully the Manager was very cordial. He took all our dishes back and didn't protest.
I was there almost a year ago and the food was amazing. I hope they get it back to its original standard....."}
{"text":"Be careful, 15% gratuity will be added to the check without forewarning.

The server and staff that we encountered seemed not to be trained in the art of serving."}
{"text":"This place had great food and ridiculously cheap. I think it would do better in a different location where people appreciate Indo-Chinese cooking. It has a great vegetarian selection. The food is on the spicy side so \"mild\" here is \"spicy\" at any other Chinese restaurant.  If you order spicy or extra spicy plan on a painful experience."}
{"text":"Only Indian Chinese place in Charlotte...  The location is kinda iffy for a lot of people, next to a \"movie\" store and a \"therapeutic massage\" parlor.  I found it funny, but when I recommended it to a friend without mentioning it, he brought his ba and mother inlaw to the restaurant and was understandably upset the next day.  

If you have kids, you might have a little explaining to do after walking from the parking lot into the restaurant, kids ask a lot of questions after that walk.    

I would give it 5 stars, but they do lean a little more towards the Asian then the Indian, more so than other places in larger cities.  The lunch specials are a great deal, but I am rarely in that part of town at that time so most of my trips have been at night.  Try their dry paneer, there aren't many restaurants in Charlotte serving it.  The Manchurian and chili dishes are also good... The dumplings were so-so, but still not bad.  My mom is a veggie and she always wants to go here when she visits Charlotte, lots for her to choose from."}
{"text":"It was ok.  Food was good.  You probably would be disappointed if you were going on a date or a romantic night."}
{"text":"One of the Best Indo-Chinese Restaurants in the Region.
The American Chop-Suey is Fantastic."}
{"text":"The food is good BUT BEWARE of the conniving ways they use to get more money out your visit.
First, when the bill is brought to you there will be a service charge of 15% added to your check, after tax, even if there is only one or two in your party. This is NOT disclosed on the menu or anywhere else in the establishment. And, if you pay by credit card, the customer copy nor the merchant copy will reflect that they have included this \"service fee\" 
Second, I knew of this little scheme when I visited there so I was prepared and gave the additional \"tip\" as cash. But, lo and behold, when I received my credit card statement they had added an additional amount to my bill AFTER I left. I called to question and was told that if the tip is not adequate they add more!! WHAT???? When I told him I left the tip on the table he said he didn't know that but \"now you know how we do things.\" 
I have filed a complaint with the BBB. I hope this review will make others more attentive to their bill and credit card statements."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in Charlotte - The food is always great and made just how you want it. We order the American chop suey and Manchurian pakora. Also, the chili paneer in garlic sauce is awesome. 
The service is spotty; sometimes it does take a while to get your water or even the lone waiter's attention but they are more than willing to cater to your needs. Once a dish we ordered wasnt cooked properly and we informed the waiter that this isn't how it usually tastes. He promptly took it back to the kitchen and also the owner of the establishment came to our table to make sure everything was ok.  Don't let it's location fool you! It is beside a tattoo parlor and an adult novelty store. Not the best of locations but once inside, it's nothing but a great restaurant with great food."}
{"text":"Delicious food served hot and fast at great prices!  I had the General Tso's Tofu for my first trip...(this is so I could compare it to other places)

AWESOME is the word that comes to mind.

My ONLY complaint about this place is the location!  Not the best part of town (and was that a stripper place two doors down?  OMG).

Don't let that bother you though....just use common sense when you visit this place...It is a MUST VISIT."}
{"text":"Best indo-Chinese food in town. Never disappointed in food nor in service... :D.  Will be eating here again and again..."}
{"text":"Great food always hot and clean place would recommend also spicy chart is awesome that's if you like hot hot

$$"}
{"text":"An interesting place...not just because of its location..(it sits between a strip club, a \"happy ending\" massage joint, and an adult novelty store.....), but its the only place around here that serves this kind of food. Fu-Lin is nothing fancy...no special service either. Just a basic restaurant with a great choice of veg/non-veg Indochinese dishes. I have been going here since they opened and have figured out what I like. Man-chow soup is good, and a must order is the Dry Chili Panner. Usually that's all I get. The prices are reasonable. Check it out if your in the mood for something different."}
{"text":"It's hard to find really good Indian-Chinese fusion restaurants.  But Fu Lin may end your search.  Their chinese paneer dishes are excellent which is the most important thing to me :)  I highly recommend the Kung Pao Paneer. The food is quite spicy even if you order it at \"medium\" so keep that in mind.  The service is also really good.

Overall I was very pleased with the experience."}
{"text":"What a gem. LOVE this place. I daydream about the Manchow soup. Everything I haven tried is fantastic. I like that you choose the level of spice you want- from mild to extra spicy with pretty much every meal. It has a large and diverse menu and I have yet to try something I didn't like. The guy that runs it is very knowledgeable and great with suggestions. Once you try it- you'll be hooked forever."}
{"text":"Update in that I again ordered the same thing only to get some average food. I got some other quite good food (I think it was beef lollipops, which were very nicely seasoned), but I was disappointed with the quality of the entrees. 

I think I'll try to get delivery from this location, because as others mentioned... pickup is a bit... uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Tried this place after a real long time and they have improved a lot ! Food was very good .. True indian Chinese style cooking .. 
Chilli chicken, chilli fish, chicken Hakka noodles and chicken fried rice were all yummy !!
Would go back again !!"}
{"text":"Fu Lin serves Indian Chinese fusion food - this is food that is very popular in India and quite common.  But many people dont know that this is a stand-alone cusine (not just some madeup fusion thing to try and be fancy).  

Its some of the best food I have ever had  - the food is bursting with flavor, spice and everything tastes very fresh.  Its a very unique type of cusine and people who have not had this before will be pleasantly surprised by the depth of flavor. 

Hands down some of the best cusine you can find - here are the dishes that will leave you speechless (or at least totally full and content):  appetizers - Mongoian paneer, lollipop chicken, and dry gobi manchurian ; main course - manchurian chicken, chilli chicken, Indian style curry beef, chilli fish dry, and manchurian pakora.  Everything is good but the dishes i listed taste like they were made by God.  Seriously. Go try it out, you will be amazed. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Fu lin is named after its 2 founding members - a little unknown trivia about the restaurant. The partnership has since broken and Frank now runs the place - he's the middle ages Asian person who greets you at the restaurant.

The restaurant is known for its Indo Chinese cuisine. If you like spicy Indian or Chinese food, you'll be happy dining here. The manchow soup is excellent - I typically get the noodles on the side instead of in the soup as they usually serve. I absolutely love the Indian style curry chicken, but have tried most other dishes and they are all decent to good.

2 things I don't like so much about this place - 

1) Location - pretty detached from everywhere. Lots of businesses came up there when the arena opened there, but since its departure, the whole neighborhood has died.

2) Wait staff - not a talented bunch, but if you're clear and a little patient, you'll be fine."}
{"text":"I demand a recount!  Just like Annie W. I too ordered the wrong item. But you know what?  I still love this crazy restaurant and I can't wait to return and order correctly. Because even though I ordered battered fried chicken swimming in gravy, (should have ordered it dry, how was I supposed to know?)  I appreciated the heat and I loved the lentil soup that was served before my lunch and my lunch was only $6.50. Hells yeah. The man at the counter was really pleasant too.  Let's get a group and go order EVERYTHING! A UYE Indo Chinese with training wheel session. Please and thank you."}
{"text":"Best fusion restaurant in Charlotte - dont mind the locale.

Always greeted with a warm welcome everytime I've gone here.  The staff practically know my order before I even sit down.  If the owner is around, he stops by tables to check on things and takes his time making suggestions and even customizing orders if you're not sure what to get.

Mongolian Paneer - simply amazing.   Slighly crispy outside with with the perfect amount of mongolian sauce all around mixed with fresh veggies!  You can even tell them if you want them to go heavy or light on the sauce/curry.  I've tried very hard in attempting to order something different everytime I go, but without any luck.  It tastes so good, I just cant stray!  I've sampled a few of the other dishes but only when I've gone with large groups!

Love the presentation of each cook to order dish - served in what looks like a mini-wok with the dish still sizzling.  Be sure to order the vegetarian lentil soup as an appetizer.  Fantastic flavors and a fresh batch made daily."}
{"text":"Very nice food. Both Veg & non Veg is good. Quantity is more per serving. Cost is nominal. Can improve the ambience.
We went for dinner."}
{"text":"Mouth-on-fire should be its name! Wowzers, the food was spicy and delicious! As much as my forehead was perspiring, I could not stop taking another bite!

We ordered the Szechuan veggies and a Darjeeling noodle dish. Both were extremely flavorful...and yes, their spice measure is hotter. If you tend to like the typical \"medium\" spice level, go \"mild\" here. Not kidding.

Nice space, sketchy strip mall, but makes for a good outting."}
{"text":"Fu-Lin gets a solid 4 star rating because of the solid yummy food they serve.  Their menu will put a smile on any Indo-Chinese food lover......or just any good food lover.  My family has been here several times, and never had a single complaint.  The lunch portions are hefty and come with a choice of soup, the dinner portions are hefty too (but I think for the $12.95 price tag, they could put a little more food in the serving)  But dont get me wrong, you will be very full.  Lunch specials start at $5.95 all the way to $8.00.  Dinner starts at $8.95 (veg) to $12.95.

Their vegetarian dishes are bar none.  I mean my sister who is a mean carnivore will eat any of the veggie dishes.  Appetizers are amazing too, I do recommend the chicken dumplings, and for the veggers out there, you can have their panner tikka or vegetable dumplings.  They have a lot of choices, so dont worry.  They also serve excellent noodle dishes, and a good Pad Thai (more Indianized than Thai)

They serve halal certified meat, which is a blessing(no pun intended) cause unless a place serves halal meat Im forced to go with seafood or vegetarian, which isnt always my first choice cause I love me my chicken and beef."}
{"text":"Fu Lin = Indo Chinese Cuisine.  When i say this to people, they dont quite understand.  so, you know how chinese food in america isn't really chinese?  its american chinese.  same principle, Fu Lin serves Chinese food with Indian influences, and the results are awesome!

Expect familiar dishes when ordering, but with an Indian flare or spice to it.  The curries are spicier (i mean with actual spices, not heat) than typical asian curries, even Mongolian dishes are spicier than what you are used to.  The fusion is very hard to explain, let alone imagine, it can only be experienced.  

They do have a normal chinese menu, but BLAH, get the real goodies.  I suggest any of the curries, Chili, Manchurian, and Mongolian are all good.  The Lollipop Chicken Wing appetizers are legit.  The Man Chow soup (i think thats what its called) is great, kind of like hot and sour, but a little different.  Lunch menu is about $7-10 for an entree, soup combo.  Dinner portions are much larger, $10-15, and can easily be split between two people.  They are served in the big fun giant steel bowls you see pictured here, and are meant to be eaten family style.  When I go with a group of 4, usually split 2-3 main entrees and get an app or 2.

The location leaves much to be desired - strip mall in next to tattoo parlor, strip club, a payday loan place, and a korean pool hall whose sign is misspelled \"Billiares.\"  But dont be deterred, this place is definitely worth the adventure, as you can't get food like this anywhere else.  except for india."}
{"text":"I live right by this restaurant and for half a year I was driving right by one of the skeezy strip mall treasures. After my first time there they haven't been able to keep my family away. My one year old daughter loves it just as much as my husband and I. Best Crab Ragoon i've had since living in Charlotte for 3 years. Classic pad thai and delicious General Tso's Chicken, so much flavor and the right amount of heat. Their sweet and sour chicken is delicious and not too sweet. My husband is a vegetarian and tries something new every time we go there(we try to go once a week) and has never been disappointed."}
{"text":"The cocky waiter is gone so I'm restoring the 3 star rating. 

My favorite flavor here is the dry-rubbed Pakora (pic #7)
I find the individual dishes a bit limited to make for a satisfying meal on their own, for that reason I think the food here works best when you're with friends and everyone shares."}
{"text":"Guys it appears that this place is now closed.  Let us know if there is a new location"}
{"text":"My first visit to this wonderful little Asian Restaurant. Yes it is close to one of Charlotte's Strip Joints. As a matter of fact one of their off duty girls came in an ordered carry out. Not to worry the place is clean, nicely decorated, and the clientele that I saw both dine in and carry out seem to be very upscale. Well Yelp, you have done it again!  I got here because of recommendations of other yelpers this very night in a discussion of Chinese restaurants.  The owner Lin and my waiter Brian were very friendly, helpful, and professional.  Lin I found out is Chinese and grew up in India.   I urged Lin to come on to this Web Site and provide us with a Web link with menu's. I love the feeling when you go into a new place and wish that you could order several entrees because of the smell, the menu and excited anticipation of the meal to come.  In this case a wonderful Thai Basil Chicken.  It comes to the table with a large portion of rice and is sizzling hot in it's own little wok.  I discussed my spicy preferences and man did they nail it.  Perfect! a wonderful  spicy basil chicken dish not quite Chinese not quiet Thai.  The vegetables were cooked perfectly and the whole dish sang  a great chorus.  As I finished up I called my friends and ask them to join me here tomorrow night. I can't wait to try Linn's recommendation of Mongolian Paneer. Check it out!  Indo Chinese Fusion!"}
{"text":"Went to have lunch today coz some friends suggested that it was good a while ago. Asked the guy at front if he would be kind enough to switch the AC on such a hot day. He did not think so. Ordered a fried rice, chicken lollypop and chilli chicken. And then w/o thinking and having a mental image of how a good indo-chinese food would be, ordered 2 fried rice and chilli chicken to-go for my friends.

When the dishes came back, my wife was furious at me....no wonder...who would order to go w/o trying out the restaurant first.

The fried rice cannot be more horrible than this, we called the waiter and asked if he could stop the togo....it was too late. The chicken was old stock and smelly.

We gave the feedback to the waiter and the manager or owner not sure who he was came to us and demanded to know what was wrong. I said i did not like it and did not feel tasty. He says....i need to know what is wrong.....then i just told him to forget it and get me the check.

He offered to take it back and redo it, it came back with some spice and more oil. I just had to just split at the time to make sure i dont do anything stupid...

He made sure that i was billed for everything. I just paid and left.

Never going back again and strongly recommending not to go
- Bad, old food
- Poor air circulation/ AC - even the cooks sweat
- Very bad customer service"}
{"text":"I'm thinking I ordered the wrong thing here.. had the Darjeeling Noodles with shrimp, and while it was flavorful, it was prepared with way too much oil, and something about this dish made me a little sick to my stomach. 

My friend, on the other hand, got the Chicken and Broccoli, which came out in a cute little steel wok, and was pleasantly surprised at how flavorful it was. 

Guess I'll have to settle somewhere in the middle on this one.. and take a star off for locational creep factor (next to a strip club, happy-ending-massage-parlor, and sexy shop)."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were on the mood for Chinese so we decided to give this place a try and ordered takeout since we saw good ratings. 

We got there and the person at the desk didn't seem all that friendly. She even seemed like she didn't like her job nor want to be there. The guy came out and I felt like he was rushing us while we were looking at the menu as contemplating what to get. We finally ordered beef lo mein and sesame chicken. The food was quickly made so I give them points for that. 

We got home and opened our selections. When I first saw the lo mein, I had the initial reaction that it didn't look promising at all but we gave it a try any ways. The noodles tasted overcooked and there was hardly any flavor to them. The beef was also tough and chewy. We moved on to the sesame chicken, which looked a bit more promising. The chicken was well cooked but the flavor still wasn't all there. Overall, the sesame chicken was alright. 

I don't believe we'll be back there any time soon."}
{"text":"I was (b)witchy-hungry by the time I hit up Fu Lin for a late lunch, and they didn't disappoint! Fast service, really friendly waiter, the owner came through to check on our meal, and the pakoras? Yeeeaaahhhh. Spicy, crispy, yummy, veggie balls served with lime and a light, sweet sauce. I could eat my way out of a vat of these.
The neighborhood isn't the crack-riddled red light district some yelpers made it out to be, either. If you're scared, bring your momma with you--she'll love the lunch specials and bright, clean dining room. And you'll be too caught up in gastronomic rapture worry about Crazy Horse dancers coming through for take out. They've gotta eat, too."}

{"text":"My husband and I love Indo-Chinese food.  I am a vegetarian and he is not.  This place had a lot of veggie options, so it definitely gets a star added for that.  The service was great, too.  We had General Tso's tofu and Vegetable Manchurian with sauce, both medium spicy.  And it was perfectly medium spicy to us.  We both enjoyed the tofu the best.  Very good flavor and the tofu was well prepared.  And it's not that we didn't like the vegetable manchurian; it was good too...we just have a favorite at a place in NJ and so we compare everything to that.  The next time we are craving Indo-Chinese cuisine, we will pay a visit to Fu Lin."}
{"text":"Indian/Chinese ...... A very special kind of Chinese food! We are so happy to find this great place! Mr.Lin is wonderful and so accomodating of gluten free diets . Bringing all our Indian friends here, because everyone need a to eat here at least once!!"}
{"text":"As you pull into the parking lot, it is not for the reason you expect - we will not be stopping at the Crazy Horse.  At least, not initially.  If you want to later, that is entirely up to you (eyes on you, Jay R.).

Know in advance that this little strip mall tucked along Independence Boulevard has seen better days.  At least, I assume they have, because they sure don't look too hot now.  Ten years (give or take) ago, you could have at least found a T.G.I. Friday's in the middle of the lot.  Now it is a boarded up husk.  Not even furniture outlet stores will dare to make their way inside.  Not legally anyway.  If you see someone there, you might want to keep going.

Then there was the Rock & Roll Emporium, sort of a mom-and-pop version of Spencer Gifts that did quasi-illicit piercings in the back room.  Not terribly sanitary, but that does take the fun out of it, right?  Then there was Seven Doors Down, which was not a band, but a lingerie/adult gift shop, that was actually run by said mom and pop, and started seven doors down from the emporium.  Even a really bad little pizza buffet, now (thankfully) gone as well.

These days you just have the Crazy Horse, what appears to be a Happy Endings Massage Parlor down the way (hmm... now we know why we get so many visitors from Northern California!), Don Pedro for Mexican and Fu Lin.  I think the Laser Quest may even have closed by now.

But that's okay, because Fu Lin is indeed a gem.  Their menu is not only impressive for vegetarian offerings, as Julia S. has mentioned, it is, in fact, impressive on just about every offering.  Even the Cheesecake Factory may come to them for menu advice.

Now I am no expert on either Indo-Chinese or vegetarian fare.  But I do like to eat.  And the food that we ordered up here was awfully tasty and some dishes come served in the coolest little steel woks to boot.  Talk about awesome.  The service wasn't exactly speedy, even though we were among the only people in the place (thus the lack of star #5).  But it is well worth a trek to the seedy side of town.  Slip through the dark side and cross that line when you get a chance."}
{"text":"For a while I've been trying to find a place in the Charlotte area that has good Indo-Chinese. Then I found one, up in Cornelius, which was quite a drive. Then I found THIS, and now I'm happy.

So one of the reasons you should go here for all your Indo-Chinese cravings, the owner Lin, is an Indian born Chinese and lived in India most of his life. Which guarantees authenticity. Yes, stay away from all those Indian restaurants that claim to have Indo-Chinese on their menu (I'm looking at you, South Indian restaurants), and stick to real Indo-Chinese.

We ordered the chicken lollipop appetizers (that's the Indo-Chinese version of wings) and it was yummy. Perfectly marinated and fried, without any artificial food colors. For the entree we ordered the Mongolian Paneer (which is slightly sweet since it's cooked in a plum sauce) and Chicken Manchurian (battered and deep fried pieces of chicken in a soy sauce, garlic and cilantro based gravy). Both hit the spot.

I was a little disappointed with the service though. We had to ask for water twice, and service was pretty slow. Even though they were not busy (only two other tables were occupied) they still took forever to bring our check. Maybe they were just understaffed that day and it's not a usual thing. Hopefully our next visit will be better in terms of service and I can update my review accordingly."}
{"text":"I visited this place with my friends. Tried veg munchurian and veg fried rice. Veg munchurian was simply amazing it exceeded all my expectations! Fried rice was too good as well it had very little oil and was flavorful. The host was friendly and service was good. Nice ambience. Quite place. Go for it!"}
{"text":"Tried chilli paneer dry, veg pakora in mongolian sauce and fried rice - not great at all!"}
{"text":"Excellent food!! Large portions. We had the Mongolian Beef n Mongolian Shrimp. They were delicious!!! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Really delicious and spicy. Probably the best indo chinese food around Charlotte area."}
{"text":"Two caveats: 1. I have little-to-no experience with Indo-Chinese and 2. Anywhere in Charlotte with more than 10 options for veggies gets an obligatory additional star.

But. Seriously. Where have you been all my life, Manchurian Pakora? This dish has no Western equivalent. Frying shreds of veggies coated in chickpea flour to crisp dumpling-land, then drowning them in a savory, spicy gravy - smothered in bird's eye chilis - hot damn, that's heaven in a stainless steel wok. 

All the entrees are. Served in woks, that is, on small metal stands. Neat! 

So yeah, there's the blacked-out-window massage parlor, strip joint, and lingerie shop all within a stone's throw of Fu Lin, but hey, that's what I like to call East Charlotte Panache. It's ok. Rent, in this strip mall, is obviously low (Don Pedro's is a two second walk away from here, home of even frugaler, if not quite as delicious, eats). Means you can get a ton of tasty food for cheap - unless you're ordering a paneer dish, or something seafoody, most of your options are 9 bucks a pop. Soups are either 2 or 4 - the larger price is a huge bowl for two.

The options for us veggies are endless. If it's not on the menu as vegetarian, and it's in any way possible to prepare it vegetarian, they'll make it for you. Guy was emphatic about the \"made to order from scratch\" concept. He also did an awesome job of explaining the differences in Manchurian rather than Chili preparations, how they spice things for various orders (ie, dried versus fresh chili), all that good stuff that you want to hear when you're an annoying, inquisitive, first-time partaker of any new cuisine. 

Lettuce wraps (on the menu why? Don't care, only place in CLT to get it with tofu) were just as I've had elsewhere, except no pine nuts. Still tasty. Nothing we ordered, meat or veg, failed to surpass expectations - but beware - medium spicy is not your typical medium. Had some crying peeps at the table by the end of the meal, including moi - but that's how I like it."}
{"text":"The food is fusion Chinese and Indian and it's full of taste. It could be spicy for some ppl but the taste is worthy it"}
{"text":"I just got back from lunch at Fu Lin.  They have the typical Chinese restaurant lunch menu where you get an entree, rice, and a soup for less than $6.

However the food is much better.  The Indian influence isn't obvious in all of their dishes, but they do have certain items where it stands out.

I started off with the Lentil soup, then had Manchurian Chicken with Jasmine rice.  The flavor of the food is great.  The serving size filled me up for sure.

Basically you get good food for a great value."}
{"text":"Fu Lin is a fantastic choice for fusion food. The place is a great blend of both Indian and Chinese foods. Only downside to Fu Lin is the wait time on your food. Be prepared to. Wait. Overall, delicious and a variety of dishes are available. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Food tastes good without any second thought but little more oil but Price sucks.  

Cons : 

Except week days lunch, all the menu items are more price.
Total cost = Menu price  + 8.5% tax + 15% service tax...... :(
I decided not to go on week ends as they are too pricey :("}
{"text":"One of the good chinese restaurants in charlotte - Reminds me of the Kolkatta Tangra Village Chinese food. The staff is super friendly and Mr Lin takes special care of his guests. The gobi , fish and paneer manchurian are delicious. one word of caution - dont ask them to make it extra spicy as that can be verrrrrrry spicy. Will defintely go back again to try some more new dishes"}
{"text":"So so service, but great Indo-Chinese food!
This place used to be a five star place when Fu owned it. He sold the place a few months ago to his former partner who now runs it. The food quality has gone down somewhat, but the quality of service has dropped significantly. Under Fu, you'd get a star treatment. He liked to talk to people and knew many of his regulars by first name. It's no longer the case.
There's also a little bit of \"nickel & dime\" culture developing. They now charge extra for little things that used to come free of charge. Despite the shortcomings, the food is still topnotch. It is the best Indian Chinese food I've found in the U.S. I know that's a bold statement but it's true!
The menu is solid with a variety of vegetable and tofu-based dishes. As a vegetarian, I find plenty there to try and enjoy."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Our waiter was great, very kind and knowledgable. We had never tried \"indo-Chinese\" and he gave us the rundown. He suggested the pan fried noodles and they were delicious. Will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"I order for my employee's he put too much broccoli and not enough shrimp he needs yo be fair  not much happy"}
{"text":"I love Asian cuisine and have tried many restaurants and carry out places. This BY FAR is the best in Charlotte!!! We can't get enough! The owner Lin, is there everyday... He will greet you, take your order, cook your food, refill your water, and  take payment. He does it all! It is consistently good with anything I order. Nothing bad comes out of that kitchen!"}
{"text":"This place is great! I suggest ordering the chicken lettuce wraps and the honey chicken...delish"}
{"text":"Pros:

Food and presentation was great. I asked for spicy and it was just the right amount of spicy, nearing uncomfortable but still very comfortable.

The vibe in the restaurant was cool. It still felt like a Mom and pop, but not run down at all.

Cons:

15% gratuity was added for a party of two, without forewarning. 

Miscommunication with the server led to purchasing $2 of rice after it was said to be included."}
