{"text":"Stumbled onto the location after tile shopping. First impression was favorable. Waitress was courteous. Ordered Tuesday special which said that two sides come with dish. While checking out,  I questioned the extra $2.85 and was told that coleslaw was considered an extra. I said that I disagree but the person who checked me out gave me my change and walked away leaving me standing. I will not return or recommend."}
{"text":"Great little breakfast dive. Quick, great service, good food - cooked to order.  Decor is a bit outdated - but that just adds to the ambience. Have been coming here occasionally for years - never been disappointed.  This is a landmark in the area- been around for many years. Not open in the evenings or on weekends."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant this morning for breakfast, food and service was good, and I'm very picky. Definitely a hidden gem in Charlotte..."}
{"text":"Definitely won't be going back to Pressley Park restaurant the bacon looked like something you would want to take a picture of and want to eat chewed like shoe leather might, pretty sure it wasn't pig and omg the pancakes no idea what they're made with but it probably wasn't flour it was yellow. The owner and staff acted like it was normal did not understand or care"}
{"text":"Pressley Park Restaurant: A Charlotte West-side Institution, has perhaps the best Breakfast deals in the city.The food is much better than any chain could hope for,and the service is great, its like eating at your moms house."}
{"text":"Very good selection. Have never been let down by the food. Diner Type selection from the northeast."}
{"text":"Very good old school country food.  Prices are perfect and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Cheap, lousy truck stop food.  Everything on the menu is either frozen, or comes from a can.  I honestly can't recommend this place, unless you are very hungry and low on cash."}
{"text":"Excellent open face turkey sandwich with gravy. Fast and friendly service. Highly recommend for a traditional meal."}
{"text":"Just tried the place because I was close. Had one of the daily lunch specials. Chicken pot pie was  decent. Fried okra was not that great. Mac and cheese treated like out of a box. Corn bread was ok. Cobbler was mediocre.   This place seems to be known for breakfast and sweet tea, neither of which I had.   It does have a charming little diner appeal but food not that great."}
{"text":"Pressley Park Restaurant is unapologetically kitschy, charmingly retro, and super good! I stumbled upon this little gem this morning and decided to check it out in spite of its less-than-stellar Yelp rating. Boy, am I glad I did!  Pressley Park Restaurant boasts, by way of a huge banner hanging off the roof (which worked by the way because it lured me in!), a $3.85 big breakfast. This special includes two eggs, hashbrowns or grits, biscuit or toast, and bologna or sausage. If you want to increase your breakfast meat options, for $5.25 you can have the same, but choose from bacon, livermush, bologna, sausage, or ham.  The coffee is delightful! It's very light, so you can drink several cups without being zooted. They serve it in small cups so the waitress refills often and it stays warm.  Pressley Park Restaurant is definitely worth adding to the breakfast diner rotation. I have not sampled their other offerings, but they serve breakfast all day, so why would you? They even have a drive-thru, for days when told are in a hurry!"}
{"text":"NASTY... JUST PLAIN NASTY...  We ordered delivery here at work and it was delivered. I ordered the shrimp and flounder plate which cost $13.28 with included gratuity. The mac and cheese looks like something out of the box with the powder cheese. I think I had 23 fries and a dry piece of cornbread. First time and definitely my last!  Oh yeah, I forgot to mention they sent a driver that I think was related to Satan. She didn't even speak or smile. All she came to do was take our money and didn't have the courtesy to say \"thank you\"."}
{"text":"3.75 breakfast special!  The sweet tea is the bomb.  Pretty waitresses? NO!  Good eggs and bacon? YES!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious.  Best chicken and dumplings in Charlotte, fried squash and green beans are my favorites.  Service is super fast and friendly.  Home cooked lunch and tea and dessert for less than $9.00.  Highly recommend giving them a try, reason they are best in Charlotte for 40 years!"}
{"text":"I wish i could give no stars this place does not kno how to follow an order all 3 times iv been there im done..."}
{"text":"They are currently pushing a breakfast platter special for $5-$6 bucks. It's close to work and was ready for take out in about 7 minutes. You can see how they package it. Nicely buttered toast on top, jelly, ketchup and plastic ware. Under the wax sheet are eggs, sausage and hash browns (I think they have other breakfast meats and grits for substitutes). Everything was great though it feels like the hash browns are a little off... Like they should be crispier (not sure if that's my preference or if they are trying to get these out too fast). Anyway, I doubt this is a destination restaurant with an iHop up on Woodlawn but if you work in this park and want a decent breakfast, go for it. It's better to support the mom-and-pop places instead of McDonalds anyway."}
{"text":"People in my office have been coming here for ever and I finally came with them.  It was Chicken and Dumplings day.  While the plate wasn't esthetically pleasing it was delicious!  The food is good, home cooking, southern food.  The staff is friendly and extremely welcoming.  I noticed that some of the wait staff took interest in their regulars lives, and I think that's sweet. Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"I've been going to Pressley Park since forever and it's always been a dependable \"meat+three\" place to go. Last week I was in the area and stopped in for lunch. I happened to be in a hamburger mode so I ordered the double cheeseburger. I will have to say that cheeseburger was one of the worst cheeseburgers I've had. Two pieces of identical slabs of hamburger that looked like they had just gone from the freezer to the bun, bypassing the flattop altogether. Cheese squares then flopped on and hardly melted. All on a sort of dry bun. It just wasn't what I was expecting or what should have been served. Yes, I'll go back some day but will probably stick with the veggie plate."}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times and I've gotten a stomach ache every time I have eaten here. Breakfast, lunch... even the salads seem like they come with a layer of grease. The only good thing about this place is that they have a drive-thru.   Update -- they do have yummy sweet tea, I gotta say"}
{"text":"There's not a whole lot I can say about this place, I think the only reason they're still in business is because they are in a business park and it's convenient for business workers to eat there. The food is just OK, nothing special about it at all. The ladies working there are very very nice, and I really enjoyed being served by them. The food just simply fall short of anything good. Interior is in need of a desperate remodel, doesn't look like it's been updated since the 80s."}
{"text":"Food here is ok. Price point is also ok on certain dishes. Quantity is decent, and service is quick. Out of convenience sake, I get take out here quite often. It's right across the street from my work. I get the ham egg and cheese sandwich in the morning. That runs a little expensive at around $5. The lunch  is more reasonable if you get any of their lunch combos you are paying close to $10, and you get quite a bit of food. Taste wise everything is mediocre. The chicken is a bit dry, but seasoned well.  They've got a little drive through which is convenient. The ladies that work there are very nice, and so is the owner."}
{"text":"Hello friends,  My sister and I used to meet some of her Police buddies here years ago very often for lunch.  A few weeks ago i over heard someone saying that they went here for breakfast. That sparked a notion for me to revisit.  I ordered eggs (with cheese), grits, ham and coffee. I HATE when ordering eggs w/ cheese and it comes out with that processed cheese that's sold as singles. YUCK... Moreover, I don't like it when it comes out just placed on top of the eggs. (What's up with that? Why not scramble the cheese INTO the eggs). Everything was pretty good as far as taste.  Food + tax + tip..around 9 bucks"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, from the servers to the delivery drivers! Great service, good food!"}
{"text":"Home cook food with love. Hard to spot if your not paying attention but its a pot of gold if you do. Trust me you will never be let down."}
{"text":"Coworkers said there's a cheap place for lunch, home cooking, and free dessert. Sounded good, so here I went tagging along. It is in the middle of a business/industrial park area. Signs advertising $2.99 breakfast & $4.99 lunch special... I figured how in the world I never heard of this place. It is a small free standing building, the inside looks just like any Greek-owned diner. Sat down and I found most lunch specials are $7.25-7.95. They have special of the day which was $5.99 BBQ plate with fries and slaw. Or $4.99 fried catfish sandwich. All of the sudden it doesn't look so bargain anymore.  I went with country fried steak ($7.95) that came with 2 sides. I just wasn't feeling fried catfish or BBQ. I should have made myself feel like them however, because my dish was plain scary looking. I don't think any real gravy can be that white and thick. It wasn't even a hint of flavor besides an odd sourness to it. I wasn't expecting alot, i even expected processed steak, but I am shivering just to think I actually ate that. I am impressed by my courage and strong stomach. The entire dish was just... bad, rice was barely warm. I didn't want to make a big deal since I was with my coworkers and we needed to get back to work. My sides were a lot more natural looking, collard green and cabbage.  I did get the complimentary soup, potato soup which in comparison to my lunch entree was a culinary masterpiece. My coworkers opted for the complimentary dessert which was peach cobbler. In my humble opinion fruit cocktail overed by 2 little pieces of arbitrary crusts isn't peach cobbler. By the way, I tasted the BBQ plate, it was a lot more edible than my steak.   Oh, they have the best iced tea in town allegedly. And the old southern lady waitress was all \"huney\" and \"sweetie\" at us. If that makes a difference for you. I guess this place is better for breakfast, and FORGET ever ordering anything with gravy. You will thank me.   Food 1  Price 1 Service 3"}
{"text":"So I was starving one morning and forgot to make my breakfast for work and it just so happened some other co-workers were ordering   I ordered the breakfast sandwich (eggs, bacon, cheese) and a side of hash browns.  Hahaha too funny... white bread was used... american cheese... classic southern I guess, but it wasn't bad... it was just as it was... basic and served its point and inexpensive.   The hash browns were good, but if I order from them again, I'd ask if they could crisp them up a bit more.   All in all, it was just fine. It won't be a staple, but a place to call on should I forget my breakfast once again.   Oh and they are plus as they deliver to our offices and are always quite busy.   Thanks for the breakfast filled me up and I didn't even need my lunch."}
