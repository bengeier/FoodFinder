{"text":"Food was pretty good. Plentiful. Just add more seasoning to the food and you got a winner."}
{"text":"Food is great. You get your money worth. Plus there given u real lobster not that imitation meat most restaurants give you. The service is great and the quality is good"}
{"text":"This place is super good. It fits the bill of cheap,fast and easy.  No it is not comparable to Benihana but that is not what it set out to do. I would compare it as fast food Benihana. We order here at least once a month, will continue too! $7.99 for chicken hibachi meal that is delicious and big enough for two meals!"}
{"text":"STAY HOME! I got the hibachi chicken for $7.99. It had rice, diced chicken and veggies.  My order was ready in lightening speed less than 5 minutes.  So you guessed it,  my food was lukewarm.  Seriously,  I found this to be no better than what I could do on my own at home. It lacked taste. I dumped all of the condiments on it and it was still just ok.  The rice was also rather wet. I can't quite put my finger on it. It was similar to instant rice. There is absolutely nothing special about this food.  I didn't even like the container it came in. It's a recycled cardboard box. I get it and applaud the effort. Just make sure that you live close because it will leak. If anyone compares this to Wasabi or benihana they would be seriously misleading you."}
{"text":"I had the Hibachi chicken and shrimp combo. It was really good and it was a very large portion. Enough for two meals. The service was really quick. I recommend this place and will eat there again."}
{"text":"This is a welcome addition to the neighborhood!  The food is fresh and hot and portions huge.  The flavors are mild, but anyone with experience with Japanese food knows that is to be expected.

Being busy working people, we are always looking for good carry out options, and this will definitely become part of our rotation.  Since the portions are so large we can easily split one meal with a sushi roll or egg roll.  With two meals, I'll have enough for lunch all week!  

Great place, quality high, price is right."}
{"text":"It's not expensive which is a plus. Location is perfect. My boyfriend ordered lobster and ribeye hibachi and I ordered shrimp it tasted like they soaked the meat in salt water over night then seasoned it with salt the next day. His hibachi had more  fat than actual meat. Along with my shrimp hibachi I  also ordered an egg roll and crab rangoon the best part of my meal. My only issue is so much oil and water came from my lo mein that it soaked my egg roll. I'm not going to say my food was bad I'll just say I won't eat here again."}
{"text":"Ordered from here several times recently taste better than Benihana had Hibachi Shrimp & Hibachi Chicken. Benihana was good a long time ago don't know what happened LOL"}
{"text":"The menu was nice for a takeout place and the wait was not long at all. There were at least 4 people ahead of me and I waited not more than 10 minutes. I ordered 3 dishes and they basically all taste the same, other than the difference in meat and either rice or noodles. As others have mentioned, the portions are generous but you still need to add some more sauces to spice up the flavors."}
{"text":"First time going here and the food was so amazing and half the price of what I would spend at Wasabi for the same exact meal....I just wish they delivered! #2up"}
{"text":"Ooh this place is nice!!!! Great hibachi, fast service, always a classic. A lil pricy but worth it-recommend the steak and shrimp hibachi combo with a mango smoothie. Aye hibach to go I love y'all"}
{"text":"This place is TERRIBLE. The food is extemely salty, looks thrown together and worst of all they don't even use lo mein noodles. They give you SPAGHETTI NOODLES. Is this an Asian carry out or Italian? Why are you using spaghetti pasta noodles? Very unauthentic. The shrimp tastes extra fishy as if it weren't fresh. I will never step foot back in this place. Spend your money elsewhere. The fact that there were like 8 workers in the back and they served me this trash is mind boggling."}
{"text":"This place is a hit or miss we have gotten really good food from here when it first opened and then other times we have gotten food that is so poorly seasoned that I have had to take it home an doctor It up on the stove myself. I have to say more times than not the food lacks seasoning but it is fresh and can be fixed with a little salt/pepper,soy sauce and garlic. If they had more consistency with the product I'd go here every time I want hibachi, but lately there's just not enough flavor. My family and I pretty much only order from here if I have time to re-cook the food."}
{"text":"They're quick when you order. I usually get the salmon and lo mein which I love from here. My mom gets the steak and she alway says medium well, there are more times than not that it's well done. When you order sides beware, I ordered a side of shrimp and they gave me 6 small shrimp. They do state the number on the menu, but beware they are tiny. We eat here all the time. The portions are really good!"}
