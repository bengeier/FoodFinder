{"text":"My husband, myself and two friends had dinner here last night. We sat at the bar. Beau was our bartender. Incredible service, awesome food and drinks!!! We eat out all of the time and this is a true gem in downtown chandler!! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Bit of a disappointment. Ordered the Pork Belly Lollipops and they were over cooked at a high heat. I know this because I have had very good pork belly before and it has the be cooked long and slowly for the fat to breakdown properly. This was dry and chewy. Decided to try the famous Meat Loaf and it too was very dry without much flavor. Might have been an off night in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Fam and I went here for lunch.  Great decor, vibe, and friendly service. Food was outstanding, too!  Definitely check this place out if you like pork belly!!  Also came here for a happy hour work function and the appetizers were outstanding."}
{"text":"The food is delicious: pork belly lollipops are a great appetizer as well the fried egg tartine. 

The steak and grain with cilantro greek yogurt is a filling and healthy entree but the osso bucco is good for when you want to enjoy something rich delicious.

For dessert I would get the chocolate bars for their delicious and salty cashew butter or the funnel cake--it'sa large portion and you get three different dipping sauces.

Ambiance: nice place to go for happy hour, it gets pretty lit on the weekends."}
{"text":"What a fantastic find! I'm so glad we happened in here today. Ross came outside to ask if we had any questions regarding the menu that they had posted on the sidewalk; that alone is great customer service and the reason we went in for lunch. Wonderful atmosphere, cook-from-scratch kitchen and delicious food, especially the steak and Brussel sprouts. The Prosciutto Bruschetta was also very good. And the soy glazed edamame starter is to die for! This is one of the best restaurants I have been to in a LONG time. The owner, Sasha, was very attentive and the manager, Ross, was beyond attentive. We will definitely be back numerous times in the future!"}
{"text":"We had reservations for Saturday night for a party of eight.  Lots of large parties there. I loved how they remodeled the interior! Very classy. I felt bad our waiter was sweating running between tables but he was decent. The drinks came out very slow the duration we were there. Several of the dishes were out for the night so a second choice had to be given (pork gone and we got the last beef). Friend said the fries were too salty the owner offered to make it right but he was fine with it not being replaced. I think I would sub the fries out for something else though since the fries are really thin. The entrees ordered were: fried chicken, blackened salmon, cast iron hamburger (w/side salad), VB steak (sea salt on top of the steak- may be too much salt), and the beef. The restaurant was packed! They probabLy could've used a couple extra employees clearing tables, filling waters etc.Our dishes sat empty for a while before being taken. I wanted to get dessert, but after a two hour dinner some of our party were ready to leave. I didn't hear if our waiter offered dessert or another drink because I was waiting in the long bathroom line. Two unisex bathrooms with sinks inside and outside. Wish it were non unisex that would eliminate long lines down in front of the kitchen doors and I hate using a toilet after a man especially when the seat is left up and there's urine on the seat/floor. Keep the place classy by offering men's and women's restrooms separate. Music came on after 9:00 and was rocking! We want to come back and listen to music, eat dessert and have another dinner. Although, very new and have some kinks to work out we look forward to trying it again and hope it succeeds and feel it's a great addition to downtown Chandler."}
{"text":"Where do I start... I have been here a handful of times. Normally when you go somewhere the first time is the best, second time okay and third is the worst. Now that I have gone beyond my third time, I can honestly say they have consistency down. The food and drinks taste great each time. Frozen chocolate bars for dessert and edamame for an appetizer, you will not be disappointed. See Ross at the front and he will make sure you have a good time!"}
{"text":"I want owner to see this review. me and my friends went last night which is Thursday.  It's pretty pricy so I assume upscale. And I expect that! We order 5 things include funnel cake. It was so skinny and oily. It looked so different than yelp picture. very disappointment. Also burrata & prosciutto didn't have prosciutto. We didn't pay attention that time so we didn't know and found out later. One more thing! not your grandma's fried chicken. yelp picture has ton of mashed potato but we only got little bit.  other than that taste was great. but portion was not that big. If this restaurant wants to charge that much and wants to be upscale,  they need to do better job. I saw great review here so I took my friends there and if this restaurant will be like this,  I don't want to go again.  Maybe that's why only a few was there on Thursday night."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for a date night and shared  entrees and a bottle of wine. The food was fantastic as was the service. If you want a good bottle of wine give their Locations CA a try."}
{"text":"This is perhaps one of the best kept secrets in downtown. We've gone there four times, tonight being the fourth with another couple. So far never a wait, I guess the word hasn't gotten out yet. The interior seating and decor is very modern and quite comfortable. It's easy to just sit, relax and have a drink or two followed by a leisurely dinner, which I love. Now the food. Many really good sounding appetizers to choose from, but so far we have only had the salmon and cream cheese spread bruschetta which was fabulous. I think one night we may go and have a variety of appetizers for dinner. So far we have had five of the main course items, including the scallops special, and are quite impressed. Each meal, quite frankly, was very, very good. We've brought two other couples there with us, at different times, and they too said that they are definitely planning to return. I'm sure that pretty soon the VB Lounge will be jammed up like the other better quality places, so we plan to enjoy them as much as we can before that happens."}
{"text":"I came here with a buddy of mine on a Saturday. I saw it was a new place in downtown Chandler and I had to come check it out. I'm so glad I did. The food was outstanding. From the appetizers, to the main dish, everything was cooked to perfection. The drinks were outstanding as well. Our bartender was Sarah and she was fabulous. I took all of her recommendations on drinks and she never steered me wrong. All the staff was great! I plan on going back again real soon. Take my advice and try this place out. You will be glad you did."}
{"text":"Try anything and you will want to come back time and time again. The worst part about your second visit will be struggling to decide whether to order the original dish you fell in love with, or venturing on to another of the inevitably delicious menu items. 
This is a great addition to the Downtown Chandler scene. The sophistication of the food, blended with a modern atmosphere and pleasing ambiance, culminates in a venue that is not matched locally. A must try!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! So much flavor and the atmosphere is cool!!  Also, everyone must try the lollipop PORK BELLY!!! I always forget how amazing it is when it melts in my mouth."}
{"text":"Just WOW!  Our new favorite place.  The steak & brussell sprouts is to die for!  Service was amazing and the place was clean."}
{"text":"New place in downtown chandler. Food was amazing . The special was lamb chops over a house salad. First off the salad was amazing nothing standard about it. The lamb chop were amazing. If they have it as a special I would definitely recommend you order them. Staff was friendly and atmosphere was nice."}
{"text":"Fabulous new restaurant in downtown Chandler! The decor is beautiful, service was good, and the food was absolutely delicious! There were 10 of us for lunch and all are meals came out timely and plated perfectly. Kudos to the Chef!"}
{"text":"Yes! Yes! Yes! We had a party of 7 on a busy Friday evening.  We were seated fairly quickly. We all ordered something different... some Ribeye steaks,  some meatloaf specials, pork belly lollipops and I personally had the salmon caesar salad. Probably the best piece of salmon I've ever eaten. Perfectly cooked and blackened. Everyone at our table enjoyed their food just as much. The cocktails were amazing and our waiter and service were top notch. Very attentive and he forgot absolutely nothing while accommodating our fairly large party.  Many local restaurants could take a few lessons from the way this one is being run. A great atmosphere,  outstanding service, amazing menu and delicious cocktails! It doesn't get much better! Thank you VB Lounge.  We will be back!  Soon!!"}
{"text":"Went here for Valentine's Day & the alternative menu was super inflated for terrible food. Won't be returning here. I spent $70+tip/tax for 2 glasses of wine and a meal that I had difficulty choking down and eventually gave up on. Even the salad was sub par. Really disappointing. The restaurant is nicely decorated though and the server was friendly, but overwhelmed. I noticed the General Manager reprimanding a male servant right out near the guests tables - super unprofessional. If he made a mistake, that wasn't the appropriate place or time to reprimand him."}
{"text":"Outstanding  new Restaurant with high end customer service And a very affordable and diversified Menu.  Lunch was perfect, best high end burger in the area hooked up with an ice cold Caesar salad steadies the appetite.  Don't turn  down the Funnel Cake desert, really unexpected, honestly excellently prepared and served treat.  Enjoy your visit for VB lounge, leave your cares at the door and meet the wonderful staff, they will amaze you!

{"text":"First time here.  Food was good.  Lots of service mistakes....   menu is small and limited.  Staff was friendly, prices were reasonable.  Kinda trendy bar/restaurant atmosphere."}
{"text":"LOVED IT! Service was attentive and friendly,  great cocktails and prices so reasonable, plus this is a local business, YEA!!
The pork belly app is amazing, YOU HAVE TO TRY IT, but so much fun stuff to explore here.  Rick and Jessica were great bartenders, so intuitive and helpful.  I had a Chanhattan to start,  as I like my bourbon but not too sweet and then tried a twist on an Old Fashioned with TEQUILA, I was skeptical and I liked the Chanhattan better, but would order both again!
We shared the caramelized onion, mushroom and EGG Tartine, it was so good! I am not one for eating breakfast all day, but this is making me rethink my ways!!
Blackened Salmon was pretty great, cooked to order (seared rare, thank you mucho), with some blackeyed peas, ( happy new year to me!!) and sweet cornbread and yummy garlic spinach. He had the special and it was finished (14oz of perfectly cooked strip) on an amazing bed of zucchini and corn.  
CANNOT WAIT to go back and do the fried chicken and the pork belly AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Went for happy hour middle of week with a few friends. Food okay. Service super annoying bordering on rude. Server had attitude from get go. No amount of smiles, please, thank yous from us influenced his dead pan responses. \"What are your happy hour wines?\" Him: \"red and white.\" He proceeded to interrupt our conversation at least 15 times (no exaggeration) over the 2 hours we were there, even after being told multiple times that we were fine and were just going to finish up what we had. The restaurant was more than half empty, so we weren't hogging table. When my friend tried to commiserate about being a server (as she used to be one), he let us know he was sommelier at the now closed Vintage 95. Guess he thinks he's above serving. We still tipped 20%, but would have been a lot more if made even a modicum of effort in the friendly department. Oh, and something wrong with AC. We were all fanning ourselves with menus."}
{"text":"I got the house salad and added steak. It was cooked perfectly. Hubby got the meatloaf and the presentation was great. He thoroughly enjoyed his. The service was very friendly and prompt. It was a nicer atmosphere than the majority of places in downtown Chandler. It was our first time there and definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"3 times ordering the same salad, 3 different versions served of the same salad.  The first time I came here for lunch, I ordered the Cauliflower Chicken salad with Wasabi dressing.  I wish I had taken a picture, beautiful presentation, warm chicken sliced and layered on the salad pyramid.  It was awesome, I raved about it all weekend.  One week later we came for dinner and of course I ordered that wonderful salad.  Only it was a disappointment, the chicken was ice cold, the Wasabi you could not even taste.  I did tell the waiter the major difference from my salad a week ago.  I feel consistency is important especially in a new restaurant.  So due to my disappointment I had not gone back in a few months.  Tonight I decided to give them another chance.  I ordered my same salad to go.  Tonight I had 2 bite size pieces of real chicken (they must have ran out) and then sliced lunch meat over the top...not sure if it was chicken or turkey all cold of course.  The salad was $17 with tax no drinks for no chicken and a slice of lunch meat that I did not eat!  How did then ruin something that was so awesome the first time!  The Wasabi dressing at least was good tonight."}
{"text":"Honesty the food was delicious and our waiter was the sweetest! I ended up getting g the chicken protein bowl and it was perfection."}
{"text":"The service and food is amazing. Sara is a great bartender. She makes an amazingly martini. If you haven't been here before you are missing out. Definitely recommend the Chicken Drummies."}
{"text":"We enjoyed an overall great experience at VB lounge. Started with a nice bottle of wine and cheese board which was there Friday evening special. Caesar salad one of the best that we have all enjoyed in a long time. Two in our party had the meatloaf which they enjoyed but enjoyed the mashed potatoes even more. The vegetable risotto was very much enjoyed by my daughter. My husband enjoyed the ribeye steak with the prosciutto wrapped asparagus and mashed potatoes. I enjoyed their seafood special which was a Mediterranean sea bass any Parmesan broth. Service was very astute. Surroundings a bit loud but that seems on par with most restaurants these days. Would highly recommend others visiting this charming downtown Chandler restaurant. We look forward to coming back soon."}
{"text":"Hip and Happening! Interestingly, this place used to be called VB Lounge and I wasn't really feeling it then but as Sasha's Kitchen & Cocktails, I have a fresh new outlook! The bartenders were great - as they should be. They had the strawberry apple hard cider, to die for! Sooo yummy! My two girlfriends and I and a great time, enjoyed the atmosphere and  will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic!  If I did not know better. I would swear I was back in Southern CA.  Sophisticated but casual.  Well-trained staff who go out of their way to thank you for coming along with the Manager. Food was terrific and waiter was as good as it gets.  Only criticism was unisex restroom that does not lock in the position you expect so I was walked in on by a waiter who was as refaced as I was.  Our waiter back at the table promised they'd get that fixed!  We'll be back often for the great food and service nonetheless!

THIS IS MY SECOND REVIEW ONE MONTH LATER.

I was excited to return with my hubby for our 18th Anniversary.  The first time I went I was hosting an out of town guest and my hubby was not with us.  

When I called for the reservation, I mentioned that we would be celebrating our Anniversary and the gentlemen who took the call right away offered that \"We'll do something special for you.\"  At fine dining establishments they often \"surprise\" you with two deserts or one to share and typically write \"Happy Anniversary\" (or \"Happy Birthday\" in chocolate on the plate.  If they do not do something like this traditionally, we probably would have chosen a different night to go there as we really enjoy the experience of having a special occasion acknowledged in this way.  It makes you feel so special and appreciated (and does not cost the restaurant much).

I will connect the dots back to this on a moment.

We ordered a cheese board and a tartine to start.  We were enjoying these until my hubby discovered two rotten strawberries and mold on his grapes on the cheese board.  We politely showed the waiter but, as we had already eaten much of the items on the cheese board, we did not send it back.  We were surprised, however, that a replacement or some sort of gesture was not offered--especially after the Manager came over and acknowledged the mold on the grapes and soggy strawberries that were starting to blacken.  He simply thanked us for letting them know.

Our entrees and sides were fine and the service decent.  After clearing our plates, our server said \"So it's your 18th Anniversary?  Would you like to see desert menus?\".   The deserts we selected were the cheesecake and funnel cake off the menu.  No chocolate anniversary message or anything special.  Not a big deal, as certainly the \"something special\" we were promised when we booked was coming? Perhaps a glass of bubbly or a cappuccino was going to be presented.  Then the bill came . . . 

On our $138 bill, there was a $6 deduction for the funnel cake.  My hubby actually had to ask the waiter if this was a concession of the rotten fruit on the $19 cheese board or a gesture for our anniversary.  The waiter said it was for our anniversary and walked off.  I know it is a small thing but we were let down because they had set an expectation that they would be doing something special for us.  

I used to be a server many years ago, and we would have probably taken the cheese board off the bill due to the rotten fruit even if most of it had been eaten already due to the customer's worry over what they had already consumed (and just as a way of saying \"Sorry\" for discovering rotten elements on our appetizer that the Sous Chef should never let pass to the customer).  The restaurants I worked at did not do the chocolate writing but all of them either offered two complimentary deserts from the menu, a special occasion dessert not on the menu or sent a cocktail over to the couple who was celebrating.  

I realize this is a young restaurant so hopefully they follow Yelp and learn from the customer feedback offered here.  A dish of ice cream or small piece of cake costing the restaurant maybe $2 is a great public relations investment to make up for a  mistake by the restaurant or to personalize the experience for the guests on a special occasion.  This makes such experiences memorable and keeps customer's willing to spend $138 for two coming back!

As a result of this experience, I am removing a star from my previous 5 star rating but will gladly add it back if we have a perfect experience next time which is what 5 Star ratings should be based on."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. I tried to book a 20 person event at this location in their private room. I was placed on hold and no one returned. I then inquired via their website and not called back. They obviously don't need the business that bad."}
{"text":"The same owners of Va Bene with a really large space!
Great ambiance, great service, and just quality food and drinks.
Pork belly lollipops and classic drinks are the way to my heart.
Donna rocks!"}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed overall. Got there around 7 pm on Tuesday night and there was hardly anyone in the restaurant. 
The restaurant itself is very clean and tidy. Service and food absolute disappointment. Our server had terrible attitude. Beyond rude and cold. When my husband complained about undercooked chicken she seemed really annoyed. In addition she could hardly notice us when we wanted something. 
The only good thing I could say about this place is the manager, he really tried to save the situation. 
We walked in expecting a great experience and great meal. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case."}
{"text":"The service was terrible. We ordered two drinks and after 20 minutes they arrived. I ordered the salmon and my father ordered the sirloin medium. 40 minutes later our food came. The brought me sirloin, not the salmon that I ordered. My father's sirloin was rare. We will never dine there again."}
{"text":"I've been here on three different occasions and this last time I finally told myself \"I must write a review\"!

I have all the times ordered the pork belly lollipops because, well, shit, they're fucking orgasmic... Nuff said

The other times I went with my preschooler who also loved all the foods, the chicken lollipops, the pork belly lollipops and the fudge bars at the end. My 3yo loved all the food! And so did I!

The second time I came, it was a short visit and I enjoyed a couple cocktails... They didn't remain with me :/

This last visit was with our couple friends who told me multiple times \"thank you for picking this place\", they agreed the food was exceptional -for dinner we had lobster (! That butter, meat so tender and lush!), Pork chop, brussel sprouts (seriously? This is the second place, culinary dropout in Tempe being the first place, that blows my mouth away with their brussel sprouts), the salmon was perfectly seared... My friends risotto was very under salted but damn everything else just kicked up the pleasure meter!!

Ok a couple things: way too much ice in my cocktails, my gimlet was basically all ice. Additionally my husbands martini was a little too vermouthy...  after my 2 back to back cocktails and no effect, I concluded their drinks are a bit watered down...bummer..."}
{"text":"Really good food, prepared in  house with fresh ingredients and at reasonable prices. 
We ate at the bar and received great service from Rick and Jessica. Even the owner and the Chef came out and checked on us!!!  We had the blackened salmon and the NY strip. Cleaned our plates!!
Great looking place too.....
I'd recommend to everyone in the Phoenix area but if you live in Chandler this place is a must go to!!!!!"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant and great ambiance. The food was fantastic. Try dessert, you won't regret it. Sarah was a great server!"}
{"text":"Googled best Meatloaf in Chandler and VB Lounge came up.  Took a chance and went to give it a try.  What a beautifully decorated lounge.  I ordered the Mac & Cheese and the Meatloaf.  Everything was so flavorful and delicious.  I ordered the Whiskey Mule cocktail and it was perfect !  I was pleasantly surprised with VB Lounge.
The waitress Katie was very nice and provided excellent service.  I will definitely return to try other delicious items on the menu.    If you are looking for somewhere to have great food and nice atmosphere VB Lounge is it. Give them a try. You too will be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"First time here. Happy to report the food and service was amazing. Our group of about 10-women ordered a variety of menu items.
I had the Mac&Cheese Skillet which was very yum. Other items that other people stated were also good----the hummus and fried chicken. Everything I saw looked great.
Generous servings at reasonable prices. Definitely will go back soon"}
{"text":"This is a brand new place that we tried on a Thursday night. The food was good... the pork belly lollypops are a good choice. The service was decent... though there were a couple of wrinkles that they need to work out, but it wasn't a deal breaker. The value was good as well, it's a nice stop if we're doing multiple venues in downtown chandler."}
{"text":"This is a pretty solid place in downtown Chandler and certainly better than other spots in the area I've been too. I met up with some girlfriends for an early dinner, and we nibbled on edamame, roasted veggies and funnel cake.

They had a decent selection of wine and cocktails. Nothing spectacular, but ok for Chandler. The food was all just satisfactory. 

I know this review seems pretty lukewarm, but given the poor choices in downtown Chandler, VB Lounge is actually a decent choice, and I'd likely come here again."}
{"text":"We were passing by on our way to another restaurant when we decided to check out the menu here. The manager was super friendly and welcoming and we decided to give this place a try.  He highly recommended we try the hummus and WOW was he right - it was the BEST hummus we have  The drinks were great, every dish we tried was excellent and we will be back! 

They have a large patio which we requested as the weather was perfect."}
{"text":"This is my second visit but the first that I had dinner. The atmosphere is great - love the ambiance and the music is nice, but not too loud. A couple bartenders are friendly but not as outgoing as I'm used to. My husband and I split the cheeseburger - so good! I got the mayo and bacon on the side and it was so tasty - the burger was cooked perfectly. The fries are amazing! I wish they had a better Pinot Noir by the glass...the blends aren't bad though. A fresh glass when I change wines would've been nice. I would recommend people to try them out and plan to be back."}
{"text":"I love this place. Everyone are friendly like Ashley and the manager Ross. Try everything on the menu bc they only know how to make great food. This is one of my favorite places to eat when I'm near downtown Chandler!"}
{"text":"I never write reviews on here but this restaurant was definitely worth my time writing one out. I had the vegetarian pozole and the salmon. So delicious! I was so full but had to try the Mom's Cheesecake as well and this crust was probably the best crust I've ever had. Server was super friendly, she came and talked to us and made us laugh. The owner made sure we were happy. Overall great food, great experience, great atmosphere!!"}
{"text":"As usual, amazing experience, Ribeye was the special, they will make whatever is required to make your evening complete"}
{"text":"On our way to San Tan Brewery, pal and I saw this happening spot so we approached the outside menu display. The host/waiter invited us in and said we would not regret it. Sure enough, the service was top notch, from the get go. The host acted as our waiter for a while even, I was impressed.

We had the charcuterie board appetizer, superb. Buddy had the pork which was delicious, and I had the VB steak, damn it had so much flavor I was amazed. Shared the funnel cake and the texture was so soft and warm, also very good. Incredible dinner and great atmosphere. Lots of eye candy too."}
{"text":"Nice trendy place in heart of downtown Chandler. A lounge vibe of sorts. Food was great and nice drink selection."}
{"text":"I loved everything about this place, except the drinks. I know most people probably appreciate a 70 proof Bourbon, but I couldnt feel my face after the first sip, so I had to send it back! I think it was the Old Fashioned, but it should be renamed One And Done. The 5th Floor was much, much better. It was a lemony twist on a lemon drop martini. Very classy. Ambiance a 10. Service a 10 (we had a large party & a lot of requests), food a 9. Could use a few more selections in addition to the typical mac n cheese, cheeseburger same old song & dance. We'll likely be back."}
{"text":"We've been regulars at Va Bene for years now. So we were super happy when we heard this place would be opening just down the street from us. We came here on recent date night on a Friday evening with no reservations and were seated immediately.

The decor and ambience is really nice!! Sports games are playing at the bar tvs which you can see all throughout the restaurant. The only thing that could be better is if they had better playlist. While we were there the same songs kept playing, at least them be good songs!

For dinner I had the meatloaf! It came with a nice potato purée and French green beans. The meatloaf had a nice glaze on it. The meatloaf was a nice size and perfectly seasoned. The potato purée was tasty, but could have used a little of it on my plate!The French beans still had a nice crunch to them which I appreciated. What was even more amazing, was the plates our dinners were served on. Beautiful white and blue Danish style plates. It was refreshing to see different plates other than the standard white round or square plates. Now if they can get their glasses to match their plates :-)

Overall, a great dinner and great night!"}
{"text":"The pork belly lollipops are a must! The fried chicken was wonderful- truly not your grandma's, but better. 
What a fun place- Anthony was our server, very personable & knowledgeable!"}
{"text":"I took my wife of 28 years to Sasha's for her birthday. As it was a Wednesday evening I was not surprised that the restaurant was mostly empty. Our server seemed a little scattered and disinterested. We started off with the Pork Belly Lollipops and they were not good. The owner came by and explained that there were new people in the kitchen and that they had the heat settings wrong. He brought us two extra explaining that he had fixed the problem but they were no better. My wife had the salmon salad, my son had the top sirloin and I had the chicken. The fried chicken was excellent but everything else was average or below and not cheap. Also when the owner was dealing with the pork belly issue we mentioned that it was my wife's birthday and offered to give her a desert on the house. When I got the bill we were charged for the desert. It was only $6 but still. The chicken is not enough to bring us back."}
{"text":"Wow this place is stunning and the upstairs area is prefect for business luncheons, training, events or even graduation dinner you have a whole area to yourself!! We host our Women Of Legacy by JO Empowerment luncheons here every week and from the owners down to the staff we have always been treated with such a high standard and respect!! Food is amazing I have tried something different each time and it's been spot on!!!"}
{"text":"Great new spot in downtown Chandler.  Definitely try the Pork Belly Lollipops...Too die for!"}
{"text":"Disappointed! We've been here for lunch and happy hour. It was good food and enjoyable. This was the first time we came for dinner. And we and our friends were celebrating our anniversary. First the dish I requested was not available and apparently they ran out at noon. My second choice was the salmon which was in a broth. It was not clearly explained that way in the menu. It was ok but not what I expected. Then when the waitress listed off desserts, we were ready to try a few. But she came back and NOTHING was available except the funnel cake! Very very disappointing!"}
{"text":"Jessica is an awesome bartender. Fabulous drinks and the pork belly lollipop s and tartines are amazing. Will definitely be back. Great addition to DTC."}
{"text":"We held a party for 36 at Sashas Kitchen and couldn't have been more pleased. The food was delicious. We had burgers, salmon salad and risotto. Even the french fries had a delicious seasoning. Our waiter was Sara and she worked very hard to accommodate everyone. We were allowed to linger and celebrate the birthday girl and never felt rushed. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"What a difference a day makes.  We went on 5/29/18 and had the best lunch and couldn't wait to come back. So on 5/31/18 we drove here talking with excitement - talking about the salmon salad with the raspberry vinaigrette purée around the edge of the plate. The waiter was so great the first time,  expressed to us that quality and customer service was his first priority. Today he was not there. But instead a waiter who made the customers feel like an inconvenience to whatever else he was doing. We ordered the same meal but this time the salmon came out RAW in the whole center. We asked for the owner since we had met him two days prior and he seemed very personable. Today not so much. The first thing he asked is that how we ordered it. We said, no just ordered salmon salad which we had two days before. Almost accusing us of ruining this plate of food somehow as guests. They remade it quickly, to quickly because the center was still raw. They forgot the raspberry purée on both plates the first and the remake today. The salad went from nice blend of cabbage a lot of kale grains and Mandarin oranges to almost exclusively up giant plate of cabbage as the salad
We looked up at the happy hour and dinner menu on our first visit and couldn't wait to come back with the larger group or for dinner however after today we will not be back and the waiter won't miss us because we were only an inconvenience to him"}
{"text":"Amazing food, incredibly hip atmosphere, the wait staff is fantastic... simply a must go!! The pork chops are unbelievably delicious!!"}
{"text":"Fresh new atmosphere. The bartenders are entertaining with unique drinks. I'll try the food sometime but the menu is a little short."}
{"text":"Everything was great!! Love the ambiance, the drinks, but more than anything, the food! The pork lollipops melted in my mouth... We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Fairly new place in the Chandler Square as I call it. I had the pork chops with sides that I was able to switch around do that was a plus.  Nice and new. Nothing really that create a wow factor which is what this place is missing. Hey have a reception stand in the front that's not used so seat yourself. If you sit at the bar you can watch the game but the hip hop music will be the audio. Overall a solid three."}
{"text":"Came here with family for an early dinner for happy hour for a birthday. The place was very nicely decorated and had a classy feel. For appetizers, we tried the Pork Belly Lollipops, Curly Fries, and the Salmon Bruschetta. Father in law loved the pork pops. The curly fries were nicely seasoned and were crispy. My husband got the Bruschetta for his meal and it was very delicious. I liked how the Salmon was creamy and paired great with the zesty arugula pesto, also large portion size. 

I had the Roasted Vegetable Risotto. My complaints were that some of the squash in the dish were undercooked and the risotto was just too oily for me. There was a layer of oil under the rice. 

Father in law tried the Meatloaf dinner and said it was very good and that he loved how rich the mashed potatoes were. 

Other people tried the burger and loved it as well. 

Our waiter was very attentive and enhanced the experience as well."}
{"text":"Came over to VB Lounge for a late lunch with some co-workers our waitress was beyond friendly and helpful which made for a pleasant dining experience. I was able to try a few of their apps such as the pork belly lollipops which was basically a hot wing, salmon bruschetta was a bit to much for my palate, maple glazed Brussel sprouts were excellent, drink and beer selection was very good with a few good local beers. Lunch I had the steak salad which beyond filling and also extremely good. Overall great service and good food."}
{"text":"Our Ladies group had lunch it and we had chicken caesar salad. I could not find any chicken in the salad all it, was was just lettuce and a few shavings of cheese $17 l will never return again."}
{"text":"This was a totally enjoyable dining experience. We made reservations on a Saturday night for 5 people.  Natalie our server was excellent & full of suggestions. We all ordered a fun cocktail & dinner was outstanding. The Meatloaf got great reviews as did the Pork Chop & Steak Salad.  The funnel cake dessert was extremely light & airy & perfect to share. We will be back."}
{"text":"Service is VERY slow even early in the evening with very few customers, my husband's steak was under cooked, my cauliflower chicken salad sounded exotic but lacked pizzazz, my sister salmon salad was really good, and her husband's meatloaf was very bland. The decor is cute, centrally located in downtown chandler and the staff is friendly but we will not go back. There are other better restaurants in Chandler."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there with a couple of friends to try out this new spot for dinner during the week. We decided to start off with some of the curly fries, edamame and then split the VB Board. The fries were out of this world, especially with that chimichuri dipping sauce. The edamame was literally addicting. It was seasoned so well and the sauce they put on top of it, was so different from just the normal edamame + salt combo. Our VB Board came with chicken lollipops, a variety of meats, roasted vegetables with amazing sauces, mini grilled cheeses, a side of the vegetable pozole and the prosciutto tartine. Everything was incredible. Seasoned well and the plating was done perfectly. There was plenty of food for us all to share and definitely worth the $40. For dessert, we ordered the funnel cake and let me just tell you, I've never had a more light and fluffier batter for something that is deep fried. It came with a trio of sauce; chocolate, strawberry and caramel- all were amazing. Overall, our experience was great down to the service. We love this place and will be coming back over and over again! So glad we have an incredible addition to downtown Chandler that is priced fairly for the quality of food you receive!"}
{"text":"So I would've given it a 5 star rating but I noticed a manager talking to a bartender in a very unprofessional manner. Not sure his name but he was short,  with an accent, and carried a major chip on his shoulder.   It disgusted me enough to not want to come back again if he's there.  As far as the food,  we only had the hummus appetizer and it was good.  Wine was good too.... not sure if I'll be back.  Probably not.  Girl power! F that guy!"}
{"text":"This is my second visit to VB Lounge. They did not disappoint. This time for lunch I Had the chopped steak salad. Excellent!  Cucumber Gimlet was very refreshing and the service was excellent. Evenings here are fun as well They have a great bar and the if you want to watch March Madness. I will be here again to try their brunch!"}
{"text":"Truly great food!! Great service.  Love this place. The cocktails were outstanding.  If you get a chance do not miss out on this place."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch and had a wonderful Cauliflower Chicken Salad. It was like a party in my mouth! Beautifully thinly sliced chicken over a bed of chopped greens (broccoli & kale) sprinkled with cauliflower rice. The dressing was the bomb!!!! A hint of horseradish was the host of this party!!!! Tried the pork belly lollipops too! Mmmmmm :) Read some of the other reviews mentioning saltyness but not sure what they were talking about. Mine was perfect. This place is a hidden gem! Don't pass it up."}
{"text":"Another downtown Chandler destination for my wife and I.
Great decor and ambiance. The food was fantastic.
The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because after our food came out the service dropped off. The owner, manager and server all apologized while not making excuses. That is key in good customer service. They are working out the kinks, but if yo like the downtown vibe, great food and drinks, don't miss out on this great spot."}
{"text":"What a great place. Food delicious, atmosphere elegant and our server Erick was amazing. It was so busy and he took such good care of us. We will be making this our date night location."}
{"text":"Pork belly lollipops were amazing. Also I highly recommend the Ross's Caesar salad. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Tried Sasha's Kitchen for the first time, and I must say the food is way better than expected, they also have great service and good vibes! You must the salmon bruschetta, your taste buds will praise you lol!"}
{"text":"Let me just say...wow! Absolutely amazing from appetizers..to drinks..to entrees! Highly recommend trying the fried egg tartine! Honestly we walked in here by accident and it turned out to be such a fabulous experience. We will be coming back soon just to try other menu items. What a fabulous addition to the down town Chandler area. If you want to dine some where a little more high end with hip/edgy food and cocktails try here!"}
{"text":"Comedy or Tragedy?  First off, the food is always excellent.  The servers need to go back to boot camp.  When we asked what the specials were, the server said there was a ribeye/shrimp appetizer combo.  When I asked if it included sides, or did I need to order some, she said it didn't, and I would need to order them.  When the food was brought out, the gentleman asked who had the sirloin?  I said I had the ribeye.  He said \"Yeah, the steak.\".  He served my daughter the Sea Bass, and called it Salmon.  Wow, my appetizer came with risotto and asparagus!  When I asked the server about it, she said she didn't know, they must be cleaning out the specials - at 5:30pm on a Saturday?  My appetizer cost $30, and with the additional sides, came out to about $60.  It's okay to make mistakes, but don't insult your customer's intelligence by lying to them - not acceptable."}
{"text":"Sasha's Kitchen has great potential.  The recipes we tried were all good except that they all were way way over salted.  If you have salt restrictions in your diet avoid this dining  experience.  Everything  up to and including the desserts were way too salty. One person in our party loves salt and even she found everything  too salty.  So please do some adjustments to the salt and I will be back in a heart beat. The place is attractive and they have nice outdoor seating.  They needed more help but that is easily remedied."}
{"text":"I don't review places much.  I haven't in quite a few years.  This place ...is staggeringly good.

I have been a fat kid for many, many years.  I have eaten all over the US and in roughly 30 countries.  Fancy south-of-France places, hole in the wall hidden gems.
I brought my wife here tonight to celebrate, and ...I think this was the best tasting meal I have ever had.

I had the daily special: a shredded short rib ravioli in some beef stock reduction.  My girl had prime rib with bacon-wrapped asparagus and mashed potatoes.  

We also had a few cocktails, ..not stingy on the booze, I can say that.  The gin gimlet was light and delicious.  Will have to try the wine menu next time.


..I work in an industry that appreciates attention to detail and a high level of competence.  Between the owner being highly involved and friendly, and the level of skill on the food and drink, I am awestruck.  Firing on all cylinders here.

I'm coming back.  You should try it."}
{"text":"Last Friday, June 16 we had my birthday celebration at the VB and it was exceptional.  Ross reserved the upstairs room for our group and he served appetizer boards that had something for everybody.  The brussel sprouts, burrata and prosciutto and the pork belly were my favorite.  Ross and his team took care of us,  and all my guests enjoyed their stay to the fullest.  Most asked me how did I find this place.  I reminded them this is Sasha and Donna's new place since most recalled  their first restaurant, Va Bene in Ahwatukkee. VB Lounge is a definite \"go to\" restaurant for any special occasion or just your regular upscale place to see and be seen!  Thank you VB!"}
{"text":"We came in for an early lunch on a Sunday.  Excellent service and food.  Started with the edamame - REALLY good.  Husband had the meatloaf and I had the chicken protein bowl - recommend both.  Sat so we could watch NCAA basketball tournament.  Service didnt rush us out the door and and refreshed our drinks regularly.  They only present a check when it is asked for - I love that! 

Yelp says \"not good for kids\" - however, there were plenty of tables with young children, servers were very interactive with them and attentive.  I would recommend it as kid appropriate during the day (linen service but not so fancy that I would be worried about disturbing other diners).  Can not comment about appropriateness in the evenings.

We will be back!"}
{"text":"Wow! So happy this place opened. This interior is open and decorated quite sleek. Lots of tables, small half booths and a nice sized bar. There is an entrance from Boston as well as an entrance from the parking lot behind that's partially paved. The menu was not elaborate making it easy to choose a fantastic meal. We started with the pork lollipops and lol I can say is order 2 servings! They are so tender, crisp and tasty. I ordered the VB steak. It was tender and juicy. A little too much cilantro sauce for me but good none the less. You can tell when everyone is enjoying their meal when no one is speaking! The music was a little loud for us, it was a Saturday night tho.... we will definitely return to this place to try more items! OH! Don't forget to order the funnel cake for desert. TO.DIE.FOR"}
{"text":"First time visitor. Went on a Friday night with no definite destination in mind. We were seated immediately. Very attentive unique entrees made for a nice surprise for dinner."}
{"text":"This past weekend we didn't want to venture far from DT Chandler and VB has been on our \"try\" list. We started with the charcuterie board which was really good, although I'd prefer at least one more cheese on the board. My daughter ordered the steak and mashed potato entree, the steak was mouth watering, cooked to perfection, the vegetables on her plate were delicious. I ordered the burger which had great flavor and get the FRIES, they're so cute, spiral, and packed with flavor. My husband ordered the vegetable risotto, it came with basil, Parmesan, and cherry tomatoes, it was good, but we really wanted to see a larger variety of vegetables or at least a seasonal veggie in the dish. Overall, the service was great, we enjoyed it all, and will definitely be back to try a few of their other dishes. Oh and they could use a larger wine list that would be a plus."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here for dinner! The vibe of this new spot is great, great music playing and even a few TV's at the bar yet still an intimate feel. Lots of space and great comfy seating. The food was amazing! I went with a friend and I had the sea bass while she had the blackened salmon, both were cooked perfect and delicious! The owner was walking around talking and checking in everyone and so friendly! For dessert we had the fry bread absolutely melt in your mouth perfect! Out service was great not too much checking in but just enough! Our server also had great recommendations!"}
{"text":"The pork belly lollipops are a must eat.  The Fried chicken with the fixins A++.  The frozen chocolate bar for dessert was a very unique dessert.  Great food, great service.  Atmosphere was very cool.
The only negative were the 2 underage (very underage) children dining at the bar.  Not sure why it was allowed."}
{"text":"This place is so good! I highly recommend the pork belly lollipops. The pictures of the food don't do this place justice. Matt was a great server! We will be back!"}
{"text":"We were visiting Chandler. Friends took us here for lunch, every dish was delicious, and service was great. We came back for dinner the next night.
Appetizer pork belly lollipop and fried chicken roll were very creative, juicy and tasty! Must try! Avocado salad, lamb chops and burrata cheese were great too. Entrée prime ribs was out of this world!   
It's a spacious and beautiful restaurant, nice bar. Atmosphere here was fun and energetic."}
{"text":"This place is art to a foodie. 

Had to try VB Lounge out, it's a newer place in the Downtown Chandler area. I am very pleased with my experience. You first walk into a swanky restaurant with attention to detail, mood appropriate lighting and music. Plenty of high tops, regular tables, booths, and seating at the wrap around bar. Plus, they have a private second floor area for parties. 
The hostess was prompt and seated us well. Our server, I believe Brian, was attentive and available as needed. He recommended drinks upon palate and presented an off menu special (which changes daily). We first ordered our drinks Whiskey Mule w/mango and Whiskey Sour, both were balanced and great additions to the night. 
Then we had Charred Vegetables which were carrots, broccoli, radish (thinly sliced), and cilantro with a balsamic drizzle. 
One entree was Pork Lollipops, delicious is all I have to say. Pork back fat marinated in an Asian sauce then seared perfectly to have it melt in your mouth all on a lollipop stick. It's amazing, to add another touch the pickled slaw underneath is not only aesthetically pleasing but balancing to saltiness of the pork. This is a must order dish. 
Another must have entree would be the fried chicken. It is amazing how light the chicken was and yet properly crispy (to add to this it is stuffed and rolled, so there is flavor hiding within), the mashed potatoes were buttery and again surprisingly light with an abundance of flavor. Then to my delight the candied carrots rivaled if not out did my mom's, no easy feat. This all in one bite is amazing, a well balanced meal. In addition, it comes with a house made applesauce that is great and helps cleanse the palate. If you are interested in spice they also have a house green and red hot sauce available that are great, the red brings the heat the green with bring complexity of flavor. Both complimented the chicken very well. 
For desert we had Cheesecake balls dipped in chocolate on lollipop sticks served on a spread of chocolate ganache and drizzled with caramel and split strawberries. If it sounds great, I promise it's better.
This place was a great choice for a romantic dinner, and it exceeded any expectations my date or I had. Big thanks to the staff who were very polite and attentive and big thanks to the Manager Ross and the Chef Brent for coming by and saying hello, you guys have done great."}
{"text":"The service was amazing , my friend and I were walking by headed to another restaurant and saw the menu posted on the side ,  one gentleman of the staff walked out and invited us inside . We sat at the bar at first and met other friendly staff members. Tried 2 different secret menu drinks ; gummie bear , Scooby snacks, both very interesting and delicious followed the house burger and it was perfectly cooked and had great flavor.  All around excellent experience , we can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Wow! First St. Patty's away from Vegas and it was all around great! Friendly staff. Will be back with my wife Megan!"}
{"text":"What a beautiful restaurant in downtown! Stunning decor with subtle lighting. Amazing delicious food. The pork chops were crispy on the top and super soft inside. The plate was so picturesque. The blackened salmon had the most amazing and delicious corn bread.  The chocolate bar was beyond anything that ever touched my taste buds- coming from a non chocolate person. Definitely must try. The sever Sarah was great!"}
{"text":"Went downtown Chandler to try a different place. Unfortunately that one was packed on St. Patty's day. So we tried VB' s. The appetizer was good as far as thinly sliced meat, pickles  & olives go. 

I struggled with the menu looking for something that jumped out at me saying \"you want this\". Unfortunately nothing did so I ordered the VB'S steak. Thinking it was an actual steak. Not medallions, at least the menu didn't disclose it. The meat wasn't great, dry even though it was ordered medium. 

For me the best part of the meal was the creamed corn & zucchini side but that wasn't a signature dish by any means. Suprisingly it consisted of whole kernels. (felt it was noteworthy)

Overall I left the meal with my hunger being satiated and yet not feeling satisfied. If they have a signature dish I'd like to know what it is so maybe I could try again. Doubt I'll be going back until I see new exciting items on the menu.

On a good note the service was good & Our waitress was really nice."}
{"text":"Stopped here last Saturday night as we could not get into DC Steak house across the street for lack of reservation. This placed happily and energetically seated us with a smile. Albeit to a wobbly table that had to be steadied by a serving napkin. 

This is a beautifully designed restaurant of a former glass store/factory. In fact they use some of the artfully designed glasses for water and wine. Contemporary and open with a nice 40 person private dining room upstairs for parties and business events. 

The menu is an eclectic blend of American, Mexican, Middle Eastern, French and I think even some South American. I have never been a big fan of such a grouping of dishes on a menu but hey, if food is good all is well. Partner had a Tartine board ( basically a French open faced sandwich) and ginger coconut soup. Like I said, eclectic blend of food. The tartine was tasty and a healthy blend of veggies and cheese. I thought soup was a little bland considering The ingredients. Now, I had their signature VB Bistro steak. Whenever I see a non description of a steak with no info on the cut. I know it is usually a lower grade cut of beef. Nothing new here. Description said a tender cut. Nothing of the sort. It lacked any marbling and was very chewy and tough. I think this may have been a sirloin cut of beef. It was served as slices with a chimichuri sauce. I would suggest they upgrade this beef selection here to something more tender. Service was pretty good and crowd was typical for a downtown Chandler restaurant. A blend of all types. 

Focus the menu, serve better grades of beef and I might try again."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best mix of good people, good food and fun.  We visited on a Sat night and enjoyed the great from-scratch mac & cheese and fried chicken.  San tan brewery on tap too.  
Live music and a good vibe."}
{"text":"We walked past VB Lounge on our way to another location for food and wine and took a look inside VB Lounge.  What we witnessed made us retract our steps and venture into the VB Lounge.  We were greeted by Sasha, the owner who made us feel more welcome than ever in comparison to every establishment we've entertained.  The atmosphere and décor is breathtaking and exhibits elegance all the while being dressed in any attire.  Sara served up drinks to perfection so much so that my husband just kept telling her to surprise him with new drinks each time because the next drink was always better then the last.  Bar none - an excellent bartender.  Now, let me tell you about the food.  I have never had such delicious food hit my taste buds.  Every dish was beyond my expectations.  The turkey melt had the best roll, the turkey puts anyone's thanksgiving turkey flavor to shame, and with the mix of peppers on top; your taste buds are having a party.  The burger we ordered was medium well and at most places this would come out as a tastless piece of ground meat that you'd have to suffer getting down your throat.  At VB Lounge you get the perfect crisp on the outside and so very juicy and tender inside.  The best burger I have ever had and I can't wait to go back for another.  Lastly, I am NOT a desert person but everyone needs to try the funnel cake that just melts in your mouth.  Pure sinful heaven.  Best location to eat in drink in downtown Chandler."}
{"text":"There are a ton of options in this part of Chandler, and I was there for an event so the menu was limited.  I ordered the VB steak, which was decent but underseasoned... however, I tried the pork chop that my neighbor ordered and it was one of the best I've ever tried!

We also sampled the cheese / appetizer tray (the big one) and the pork belly sticks were perfection... the service was solid and if I'm ever back in the area I'm curious to see the entire menu to see if I may have missed something cause I can't recommend the steak at that price.

There was a bit of a flub with our group and another who was there the same night but the manager handled it brilliantly so for this they earned the 4th star!"}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Madonna - La Isla Bonita)

Last night I dreamt of Va Bene
Just like I'd always Yelp, I knew the song
A young boy with eyes for some dessert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the Chandler breeze
On the menu steak and wine
This is where I long to be 
At the Va Bene Lounge


VB or VaBene, a sister restaurant, is a swanky sweet spot in downtown Chandler.  What used to be a glass shop is now this beautifully placed upscale restaurant.  

I came here for a birthday dinner and our service was impeccable; granted it was a Wednesday night and we were one of the few tables around.  We started off with some appetizers and drinks.  We shot for the Pork Belly and Chicken Lollipops.  The pork belly confit was fried and skewered on a stick, it had a pickled taste which went well with the subtle salty bite; it was definitely tender since it came apart with just the fork.  The chicken lollipops were fried mini drumsticks and were super crunchy and thick!  It had a hint of spicy glaze and hot in temperature.  For our entree, I went for the VB Steak.  I ordered it rare and indeed it was since I could see the red in each cut.  It was prepared pre-cut, which takes the enjoyment out for me.  It was atop a bed of chimichurri sauce along with my well seasoned vegetables.  Overall, the steak was cooked to perfection and one can't say too much except, bon appetit!  However, I would say my buddy had the best bite of the night; he ordered the Beef Osso Bucco.  It had a hint of vanilla glaze and the meat literally fell off the bone.  The meat was gelatinous and an aroma burst out of every bite....you know that feeling when you ordered wrong....yep!  

In the end, I will have that Osso Bucco!  Haha, thus a revisit!  Service was really good and I even got a birthday shot from the staff - Cheers!  The restaurant is beautiful as I can't express enough and the food is well cooked and well done! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is one of best hidden gems in Chandler. The food was fantastic., great happy hour choices and prices, amazing funnel cake dessert. The best part was the service. Natalie is an amazing server. My wife has a food allergy and Natalie double check with the chefs and then made sure it would be ok for my wife. We will be back and will always ask for her. Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"A surprising new addition to fine fare in Chandler, VB Lounge will not disappoint.  The sleek and modern decor set the stage for amazing culinary creations coming out of the scratch kitchen.  Unique craft cocktails and a friendly staff ensure you will leave happier than when you arrived.  Be sure to save room for dessert because you won't want to miss trying \"Mom's Cheesecake\" which is a family heirloom."}
{"text":"Sarah our server (twice now) is the fifth star. Fried Chicken off the hook. Osso-Buco melt in your mouth. Pork fat lollipops omg! Then funnel cake (it really isn't shareable. It's that good)"}
{"text":"Disappointed not only with the food but the service. $45 for a ribeye steak that was no where near the 14oz they claimed on the menu. It said on the menu it was supposed to be served with mashed potatoes puree, a smear of potato does not constitute a side. Our friend ordered halibut, it was so bland she couldn't even eat it. The manager did come over but then offered to take it off the bill, well ya, she only had 2 bites,  ya think??? Our waiter was no where to be found most of the time with the place barely half full on a Saturday night. That should have been a clue."}
{"text":"The food was really good and the service was amazing. The curly fry stack and chicken lollipops were delicious, and my VB burger was cooked perfectly and was one of the best I have had! We will be back :)"}
{"text":"One word: phenomenal. This place is a must-go for those who value high-quality food, coupled with excellent customer service. The hospitality was sincere from server to owner. 
Nikola was our server and he went above and beyond to ensure our experience was a memorable one. 
The owner Sasha even came to our table to engage in a friendly conversation. 
I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Ooh La La!!  This new restaurant is the Bomb!!  Yummy food and the atmosphere is very chic.   The salads are fresh and exciting and the main courses are to die for.  The Best Funnel cake around with 3 sauces.   We had the Steak and Salmon and it was cooked to perfection.    Everyone is so friendly and answered all of our questions.   Great Addition to Downtown Chandler."}
{"text":"First I have nothing bad to say about the food it was delicious but pricey. The reason why I'm giving a one star is that the service was horrible not only was are server slow but I feel like this was her first time serving. And to top it off she included the gratuity and said it was a machine malfunction I call bs but hey she got her great gratuity tip for horrible service good job so I probably won't be coming back again or recommending it to anyone. Rather go to San tan brewery"}
{"text":"We werent sure where we were going to eat and we bumped into a couple who highly recommended the BBQ place a couple of yards away. The owner (manager?) of Sashas had nothing but positive things to say about his competitor but also said HE had trout and mussles as specials! He got us! 
We just missed happy hour :( -- nice drink and app specials. I had to check out what the table next to us were having (YES, I am one of THOSE people). They ordered the brussel sprouts and they looked fabulous-- but I have them in the fridge. (They ate every scrap). The burger $14 looked amazing! Steak salad looked fabulous. Other salad was also devoured. The 4th diner said his fried chicken was dry and may have been compensated (he ate everything on his plate)... i ordered the butternut squash risotto $17 (omg--divine) hubby ordered the muscle $15 (which i loved and hubby said mine was better). So, hubs enjoyed his draft pilsner and I enjoyed not 1, but 2, of the best lemondrop martinis (not too sweet). The atmosphere was friendly and not too loud, but it also wasnt packed (not sure why as this is a \"come back\" place)."}
{"text":"OMG! This place is insanely good! Our service was perfect (his name is Tyler), the food was perfect and the ambiance as well... perfect. I had the ginger coconut soup - so good! My husband had the sea bass and my husband had the burger (the fries are a must steal from his plate situation!) and it was all so so good! We will be regulars. This is a must do place! ENJOY!!!!"}
{"text":"Love the revamp of downtown Chandler. This little place is just the start of it all. Great place to sit and relax to people watch or enjoy theyear round AZ sun. Fun and friendly waitstaff and fun cocktails. Ordered a glass of chardonay and one of their boards,  so good and reasonably priced. Saw a couple sit next to me order  a GIANT slice of pizza that looked amazing must try that next time. Love the inside/outside wrap around bar and the decor. This place is cute and hip and done right."}
{"text":"We had a meeting in downtown Chandler and stumbled across Sasha's Kitchen. The decor is nice and the chairs and sofas are very comfy. We ordered the Diced Chicken protein bowl and a Chicken tortilla soup.  The protein bowl was very tasty and quite filling. The soup was a disappointment it tasted mainly like a red chili broth and the serving size was about 1/2 cup (see photo we swish it around to show the server how little was in the bowl)  for a bowl order. 
The service was friendly and checked in 1 or 2 times."}
{"text":"This was our first visit - and it will be our last.  Our reservation was on a Saturday night.  The restaurant had a few customers, but was not super busy.  Despite that, our server was extremely inattentive.  He took our drink order, then several minutes later decided to grace us with his presence to take our appetizer order.  Well after we had finished our appetizers, we had to flag him down to take our dinner order.  He didn't write anything down and seemed as if we were inconveniencing him by taking our order.  I asked for a substitution for the side, and he flippantly replied, \"Yeah, we can do that.\"  Alas, he forgot or didn't make the effort to submit my request and I received the side that I did not want.  I didn't say anything when he brought the food as who knows how long it would have taken to get the corrected dish?  No apologies, despite the fact that I clearly hadn't touched the item.  Our water glasses were only refilled once by the hostess.  No soup of the day was available, despite being on the menu.  The whole dining experience took about three hours, which was completely ridiculous.  The restaurant could benefit by hiring bus attendants or side servers.  it's clear their efforts to save money lost this potential future customer."}
{"text":"My god, this place is fantastic! The vegetarian posole was great!! I got just the soup and it filled me up! My boyfriend got the fried chicken and he said it was the best chicken he has ever had! The pork belly lollipops are absolutely to die for!!! Chef Anthony came out and asked how everything was and the owner greeted us as well. Best meal I have had in chandler! This is a must go to!!!! Trust me on this one!"}
{"text":"Our party of three had reservations for Sunday lunch but they weren't necessary. But, I loved the convenience of placing them online on their website. Our waiter worked his tail off, serving all the customers and tending bar. He was efficient, professional and very welcoming.  More importantly, the food was outstanding! And we cleaned our plates! I had the Steakhouse Salad. It was to die for! Crisp lettuce, bacon crumbles, sliced mushrooms tossed with a delicious Horseradish dressing and topped with fried onion rings and sirloin steak cubes cooked to temperature. It was a large portion but I managed it all with a smile on my face.  My son raved about the Steak and Brussel Sprouts plate. And my daughter-in-law was convinced she made the best choice with the Angus Cheeseburger. We thoroughly enjoyed our time here. Service great! Food great! Can't wait to go back and try some of the other inventive menu offerings."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best places we ate at in our trip to Arizona. The food was phenomenal and absolutely worth it. The funnel cake is a must have! Give this place a try if you're looking for a great culinary experience. This place also does brunch which I'm sure is just as good as it's dinner service."}
{"text":"I loved it here! I came with a group of people and we all loved what we ordered (the filet, pork chop, and chicken). I just wish I could have tried everything. Everything on the menu looks great and from what I could see other tables ordering looked even better. I recommend giving this restaurant a try, the atmosphere is great and I love the way the bar is set up. This is a great new addition to downtown chandler and I loved finding out that VB Lounge is a sister property for their other location Va Bene that comes with years of experience and good food as well."}
{"text":"Outstanding service, great cocktails. I recommend the VB Chef's plate, it tastes amazing. The pork belly lollipops are to die for. Amazing atmosphere. Reasonably priced. Could possibly be the best restaurant in town!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, the food was fresh and delicious and the Sonoran Old Fashioned was top notch!"}
{"text":"Over promised. Under-delivered.

I'm not really sure why this place has such highly rated reviews. 

My sisters and I stopped in for lunch. We were headed to Vintage 95, but it's closed down. We've already been to Original Chop Shop several times, so we wanted to try something new.

We walked by and perused the lunch menu. All the lunch dishes were about $10, and I thought that was a pretty good deal given that they had items like pork belly lollipops and salmon on the lunch menu. I was a little unsure since there were no other customers in there.

A young gentlemen sitting in the front (I'm assuming he was an owner or manager), but said they had the best food and was very insistent we come try out the place. We found him endearing (probably because he reminded us a little of our brother who owns 5 restaurants in Utah, so we understand how nerve racking and difficult getting your new restaurant established can be), so we gave it a shot despite our better judgment.

The red flags for us were there were no other customers and it looks like they spent way too much on the decor, (the guy mentioned everything was Italian leather, and I'm like, who cares it's Chandler), which usually means budget wise, they spent too much on decor and have to cheap out on the food quality or they've hired a cook instead of a chef.

I ordered the pork belly lollipops with the house salad, my sister ordered the chicken lollipops and house salad. 

Pork belly was decent. House salad had too many carrots in it and the dressing was pure lemon juice. Side note- why would you have a chopped salad as your house salad when that is what your direct competition next door does? And they do it much better. So people naturally will make a direct comparison.

We never saw our server after the food came out, which is another thing I took issue with. We didn't like the house dressing that came with the salad, so I asked if they offered different salad dressings. The response was - we might have some ranch in the back. Really? This supposedly higher end establishment and you don't even have a simple balsamic vinaigrette? Furthermore, there should have been a follow up - did you not like the dressing? What can we do to substitute? Nothing. It was almost as if I offended the guy asking for different dressing. And to add insult to injury, I found a piece of plastic wrap in my salad about halfway through eating it. Done. 

We didn't bother giving feedback in person. I don't think it would have been well received. We just wanted to leave. Not inclined to go back."}
{"text":"Fried chicken was off the charts! Great service and wonderful food and atmosphere.  Can't wait to come back and try the slow cooked pork."}
{"text":"I am surprised by all the really excellent reviews. My experience was not good.  The cocktail drinks were quite small. They were served in a very large glass which makes them look even look more pathetic.  The goat cheese tartines were fresh tasting but lacked flavor.  I had the sea bass which was a thin piece of fish w skin.  Unexpected for sea bass.  My wife had the slow cooked pork which was nothing special.  On the good side the appearance of the restaurant was nice. They have a large bar.  Or service was good."}
{"text":"Came in on Saturday night with a 7:45 reservation, turns out we didn't really need one as there were only 3 or 4 tables taken. Not sure how no one knows about this place as the food is outstanding and very reasonably priced (10oz steak & blackened salmon, $22 each). My wife and I each had 2 drinks, we had an appetizer and each had an entree and our bill was under $100. The VB steak was awesome, perfect medium rare and I snuck a bite of my wife's blackened salmon which was equally as great. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Have been here for both lunch and dinner. Multiple times for each, and trying a variety of menu items each time. The quality and taste of the food keeps bringing me back. The unique atmosphere is very comfortable for conversation with friends, and the staff are very professional and accommodating for any request.  Highly recommend trying, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is so cute. Gabby at the front door is so sweet! Everyone is so nice. The food is great, drinks are fantastic, Natalie is the best server!! Ask for her when you go in. My brother and I got the lamb appetizer - ridiculous, perfectly cooked. We also got the ribeye, also perfectly cooked. I'm Keto so I substituted Brussel sprouts for the mashed potatoes, and they were delectable. I also asked for extra weird stuff for my Caesar salad, and they totally accommodated my odd requests and it was so good. Just a really fun, happy experience, great ambiance and 80s/90s music playing in the background but not too loud. Perfect for people in their 30s/40s/50s who want to have good food and good drinks and talk to nice people."}
{"text":"Nice find.  We stumbled upon Sasha's after finding out the Mexican place were were going to was closed.  Looked up restaurants on Yelp and decided to walk over to Sasha's.

Quick Summary
Highly recommend.  Sasha's has something on the menu for everyone (burgers, chicken, steak, meatloaf, fish, salads, etc.). If I lived in Chandler then this would be on my list for top places to eat.  

Highlights
- Caesar salad was good
- Pumpkin Seed Crusted Salmon Salad was a hit (according to my dinner guest)
- Sirloin (my entree) was very good.  Note, this is not a steakhouse but I still enjoyed the steak.
- Outdoor seating was great
- Cocktails rocked
- Wine selection (by the glass) very limited
- Since this is in downtown, you are parking on the street (FYI)"}
{"text":"Valentines Date Night with my husband. It was wonderful. Drinks strong. The meal was very pleasing to the palate. Seating extremely comfortable. The music was at a perfect volume and the tunes were my favorite R&B songs from the 70's - 90's. The Manager and Server were extremely friendly and checked in on us about every ten minutes. If you are looking for a sophisticated evening out this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Although the service was pretty poor on my first trip to VB Lounge, they seemed to have taken my previous review to heart. My husband and I had family visiting from out of town, and we brought them here for a few drinks and light food. I have to say, the service was MUCH better! Everyone was very attentive to us, and the cocktails were delish! I'm glad I gave this place another try."}
{"text":"One my recent trip to Chandler I actually ended up at this spot twice! The first evening we enjoyed the lamb appetizer to start things off, which was fantastic! My entree was the burger, which was nothing special and came with very skinny curly fries, however they weren't very crispy. My friend ordered the fried chicken, unfortunately they were out of that (I've heard it's amazing) and he ordered a salmon entree instead. This was very yummy! The next night we came back with other friends, this time opting to sit at the bar. It was Cinco de Mayo and there were plenty of drink specials! The bar tenders were all very friendly and attentive as well. I would definitely return, probably just for drinks and appetizers next time I'm in Arizona."}
{"text":"First time to this new downtown spot but the food and drinks are amazing! I really didn't plan on dessert but so happy the bartender recommended the \"funnel cake\" it's not really a funnel cake but it is a little bit of heaven"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I decided to switch up our weekend routine and wanted to add day drinking to our Saturday schedule.  She has been wanting to try VB Lounge for some time now and we decided to pop in.  

Our first impression was \"wow\" the inside of this place is beautiful and very well done. The establishment appeared to be clean and we were excited to be there.  

We took a seat at the bar and looked over the tent menu that was there.  The place wasn't busy at all. We were 1 of the 5 couples at the bar.  We waited around 7 minutes before anyone even greeted us which was unacceptable.  It was to the point where I told my girlfriend that if the basketball game on TV ended before we were greeted we would get up and leave.  

The long brown hair bartender was not on her game.  She was prepping the bar while talking to two gentleman the whole time.  She made her rounds to others at the bar and completely missed us which is hard to do with only TEN people at a bar.  Finally a nice guy greeted us and we ordered our drinks.  I observed a older couple walk in and have a seat at the bar.  She watched them have a seat and continued her conversation until a young lady who look liked her shift just started went over to greet them.  It wasn't until the two gentlemen left before she began to actually provide service to the rest of the bar.  I found this unacceptable as did the couple next to us who I overheard discussing the same thing. 

My girlfriend got the 5 floor something which she loved. I got the old fashioned made with tequila that was on the menu which was ok at best.  The highlight of our experience was their curly fry stack.  We are both big fans of fries (who isn't?) and were impressed. 

Overall this place has great potential.... The inside is beautiful, clean and very well decorated.  The ambiance is just right.  The only thing I would suggest they improve on is their music, the selection and volume wasn't bad but it did cut off and stay off for a while before someone turned it back on.  The service is sub par.  As good as those fries were I will not be returning.  However I do encourage anyone who's on the fence about this place to go and at least try it.  

I hope your experience is better than mine."}
{"text":"New little restaurant and bar in Chandler. Service was just ok and the food a little better. Go here on Mondays if Brickyard is closed or too busy to get into."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great service! We had the pork belly lollipops, the vegetarian pozole, osso bucco and grain salad with steak. It was all so good, beautifully prepared and at great prices. I would highly recommend for a night out. Great addition to downtown chandler. The bartender was attentive, Chef Anthony came out to ask how dinner was. We also met the owner who was very friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Our experience here was great.  The service,  ambience, drinks and food was exceptional. The waiter even asked if they could do something special that wasn't in the menu,  and they honored our request;  how many places will do this? 

This is a great spot for a date,  or a nice chill semi classy spot with friends.  Definitely will be here often."}
{"text":"This place is amazing both aesthetically and in terms of the product they put out.  The food is delicious and so are the drinks!  Excellent wait staff that are attentive and accurate and the decor in this place is just stunning.  I candle here for my anniversary with my fiancé and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Just found my new favorite dessert: the Frozen Chocolate Bar! Soooo good!  

Pros: The food is great!  We ordered the curly fry stack, meat board, and mac and cheese. All were really good!  Decor is funky and it was a good date night place. Located in a good area.

cons: No hostess at the station. The waiters were doing hostessing, too, and people had to wait a bit. I saw about 3 or 4 groups come in, wait too long for someone to come up to the front, and then leave. They seemed a little understaffed, but the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Was jusr here over the weekend but my usual mid week  hangout was having a private party, l so came back here to check out their steak. Excellent!  Had their espresso martini Again, YUM.  Ross recommended their red \"madness cures insanity\" which paired very well with the steak but the name alone was the clincher!"}
{"text":"We liked the location and ambience but the service was extremely slow and the food was mediocre at best. Disappointed that it wasn't better :("}
{"text":"Want something that rock your socks in downtown Chandler? Get your butts over here... for the night I had some pork belly lollipops, I'm Asian so I've had many pork bellies in my life... this place tops it all. Now that's just for a start. VB steak, medium rare is cooked to the perfection. The sauce for the steak fits perfectly well like white on rice. It compliments the steak well with a little sour taste.. so so good. Onto the dessert, mom's cheesecake and chocolate cake bars... delicious. None of these were too sweet with a little bit of saltiness to compliment the sweetness. I love it, everything about the place. The ambient is also good and the bartenders are providing such an excellent customer services. You can't go wrong with VB lounge, come in and enjoy it."}
{"text":"What a great place!  
The atmosphere and decor are beautiful... upscale, casual, and comfy.  The menu is divine, and the service impeccable.  I can't wait to go back again!  
Try pork belly lollipops and the funnel cake.  A-maz-ing!"}
{"text":"I went to sasha's last night for my 23rd birthday because I had heard nothing but amazing things about them. IT WAS HORRIBLE! I am not one to post on yelp (never have unless it was something good). The service was horrible, it could have been a bad night, I used to work as a waitress, I understand, but the problem is that they knew they messed up. They comped our whole meal before it was even brought out to us, due to the fact that we had been waiting for almost two hours for it already. BUT once they competed our food they ignored us, they walked right past us several times. The waitress said she was going to surprise me with a dessert that never came. The table next to us (that had gotten there an hour after us) got their dessert before I did. With that being a huge slap in the face on my birthday we decided to just walk out. I am not saying do not go there, the food was amazing, I am simply just giving an honest review about the horrible night I had last night that made me feel like crap on my birthday."}
{"text":"A really great experience!!

We are a family of 4 and decided to try this place for the first time.  I was not disappointed.  It was very well decorated.  Love the couches for each side booth tables.  Nickola, our waiter was very kind and friendly.  The food is priced appropriately for upper scale location and ambiance.

The food is also just as good as many have posted!  Even down to the mac and cheese!  I had the \"Riced Cauliflower Salad\"...mmm, delicious! I'm looking forward to a Sunday brunch soon.  Bravo, Sasha's Kitchen!"}
{"text":"A refreshing addition to the usually casual scene in Chandler. One of the best, upscale restaurants in Chandler or the southeast valley. Beautifully decorated, pleasant service, delicious food and drinks. Every dish was being complimented by our table.  So happy there is finally a nice restaurant in Chandler."}
{"text":"Great to have another restaurant in downtown Chandler! Went for happy hour, which was $1 off beers and wines, they also have a couple dollars off select appetizers. The regular dinner menu had about 10 salads and 10 main dishes. Most main courses ranged from $25-$30... they did have a burger for around $15. Thought it was a little pricey. 

The decor and feel of the place is really nice and elegant though. They also have live music every weekend, it alternates between Friday and Saturdays starting at 9pm."}
{"text":"We came for cocktails and to listen to some live music.  We ended up ordering the Pork Belly Lollipops and food forever is ruined. They were excellent.  Really.  Really. Really. Melt on your mouth excellent.  Service was attentive. Ambiance was very high class.  We will be coming back often.  Can't wait to try more menu items."}
{"text":"Attended a private event tonight and absolutely loved the restaurant decor,  food and cocktails.   Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Beware if you need to be gluten free for medical reasons. There are items on the menu that specially say gluten free, but when I ordered one-the salmon salad- it came out with a bunch of farro mixed in with the salad. Farro is a type of wheat and is absolutely not gluten free. It took several tries to get them to confirm it was farro, and they kept assuring me it was gluten free. For my own protection, I'm not going to trust them that this is some special gluten free farro because I'm pretty sure that doesn't exist (it IS wheat), especially since I got a bunch of conflicting information from various staff there. I don't like causing a fuss or having to send food back, and I REALLY don't like arguing with people about what is clearly nonsense. The waitstaff was super nice and apologetic about the whole thing, but the manager and chef need to get some education about food sensitivities if they are going to advertise things as gluten free and then endanger those who take their word for it. 

Other than that, the food was pretty good and the waitstaff friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Our first trip was fantastic and definitely left us wanting to return.  The service was very friendly and quick.  They have both small plates as well as entrees.  We had one of each to try a couple things starting with the Prosciutto Tartine.  It is a great combination of flavors and textures served an a very long and large piece of toasted bread.  More of a Bruschetta then a flatbread.  Then we split a fired chicken.  Without a doubt, one of the most moist chicken dishes I have ever had.  Happy hour specials from 3 to 7 M-F.

Also great for sports events as they have quite a few large TVs over the centrally located bar."}
{"text":"Holy moly. I love this place. Great food great service and reasonable prices. Seriously."}
{"text":"We highly recommend this place. Great atmosphere, awesome service and awesome food and drinks. The chefs choice tapas platter is wonderful. This is our second trip in and we plan to make it back soon."}
{"text":"Chandler FAVORITE! Everything thing was magnificent. 
Anthony was our waiter and was so good that in the end we thanked him for serving us."}
{"text":"Food was good - 
Had the chicken drummies as an app- the chicken wings were a little dry
Had the seared Atlantic salmon - the description on the menu doesn't fit what you actually get- more like a salmon filet served on a soup with veggies.
Music was not fitting to the appearance of the decore- 
Sever was very friendly."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  Amazing staff.  And the food is, well, beyond delicious!  Try the bruschetta, or their amazing Caesar, the lauded drummers, or the fish specials.  One of the best in downtown Chandler!"}
{"text":"Darn, I wanted to help this restaurant out.   Service was nonexistent ...one man was doing the bar and waiting on tables.   We had to flag him down several times.  Food was average at best.  I always ask myself if I would go back....the answer is \"no\".   Nothing outstanding."}
{"text":"The food was amazing.  The salmon dish had a nice crust yet melted like butter with each bite. Burger was juicy and fantastic.  However, our server never brought my drink, didn't refill our drinks and was basically unavailable.  Will return but next time request another server."}
{"text":"I Love this place ! Has amazing food and drinks and the staff is phenomenal! They have a private room perfect for graduations Dinners events and rehearsal dinner's and so on love it!"}
{"text":"Cool place with great drink and appetizer menu. Service is great and the atmosphere is fun. Great to hang out. Staff very accommodating and friendly."}
{"text":"avocado salad - fresh
pork shop - succulent
spinach- garlicky yay!!!
ambience- bad ass 

love me some vb lounge!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem among gems.  The downtown Chandler corridor has half a dozen great places to choose from but this is my favorite.  I was really impressed at the creativity and energy of the menu.  There were some go-to dishes every wine bar offers but there were some really creative, inspired selections too.  The waiter I had \"knew his stuff\" about the wine list and the prices were great, especially during happy hour.  I will definitely be back.

Michael"}
{"text":"Mediocre food that is overpriced! I had the vegetable risotto with a side of blackened salmon. The salmon was definitely not seasoned the way it is supposed to and was essentially overly cooked and pan fried. The risotto was okay, nothing special about it. I think the price I paid for the meal ($17 risotto, $8 for salmon) was definitely not worth it. I will not be coming back here for food. Maybe this place has high reviews for the happy hour and drinks but don't waste your money on eating a meal here!"}
{"text":"Where do I start, maybe the original mouth watering starters or the flavor packed salads or maybe the fried chicken!?!? I can't get enough of their menu and incredible value. The modern comfortable vibe makes you want to start and end your night there. PS the CHEESECAKE is orgasmic!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this establishment, the immediate ambience was pleasurable and enjoyed their aesthetic. Food was enjoyable overall but what really clouded my visit was the extremely slow service."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food atmosphere and delightful staff. Excited to go again soon. We were looking for a nice lunch and I ordered the best meatloaf ever. I need the recipe so good! My new go to for meatloaf. But there are other yummy things to try!"}
{"text":"Great experience! Love the food, love the vibe, great service and awesome wine selections."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in here as a semi-last resort last night, after going to two other bars in the area and not receiving service (one place didn't acknowledge us after sitting at the bar for ten minutes; the other wouldn't seat us at a table (of which over 80% were empty) because the bar was full and we just wanted a drink). We got right in, and even with a relatively packed bar, we found seats and were served right away. Who I assume was the manager was super friendly, welcoming and accommodating. Drinks were pretty good, too. Only reason for not giving a fifth star was the fact that, who I assume was the owner, was openly chastising and grilling his staff right in front of us in the middle of the bar over an open bottle of champagne. That's definitely not going to stop us from going back, though."}
{"text":"We had an incredible night at VB Lounge. We sat at the bar, and were fortunate enough to have Beau wait on us. Our drinks were amazing, the food was delicious, and even more importantly the service was exceptional. We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"We went for lunch on a Saturday and sadly they were nearly empty.  I say sadly because the ambiance is much better than most spots in downtown Chandler, the service was excellent and the food was outstanding.
I had heard that they have a de-boned, deep fried half chicken that is really good and I wanted to try it.  Unfortunately it isn't on their lunch menu.  But when I asked about it, the owner checked with the chef and he said no problem, it would just take a few extra minutes.  I didn't mind because it gave me more time to enjoy the atmosphere and have one more beer.
We ordered the pork belly lollipops with caesar salad as an app and waited for the chicken.  The pork belly was absolutely delicious.  It is served with a tangy cole slaw and a balsamic reduction.  This is a very nice flavor combination.  My wife said the salad was one of the best caesar salads she has had in a long time.  (Their menu says all of their sauces and dressings are made fresh daily in-house).
The chicken is a de-boned half chicken rolled up tightly, seasoned (perfectly) and deep fried.  It is served with delicious mashed potatoes and candied carrots.  It is also served with a smoked apple sauce.  This is one of the most unique preparation for chicken that I have ever seen.  It was fantastic.
The owner was very attentive and filled us in on the background of the restaurant and the menu.
We will return many times since there are so many things on the menu that we want to try.  This will be our go to spot when people visit from out of town."}
{"text":"Amazing new restaurant in downtown Chandler... a must stop ...Brent is a first class chef and ask for Tyler our super star waiter!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was good but service kinda sucked.  The manager or owner seemed to be overwhelmed and was trying to help the server but it seemed to  work in reverse.   It took a long time to order and when I ordered a drink the server forgot it.   When I re-ordered it took forever to get it and the place wasn't that busy...  I will give them a second chance because I'm a small business owner and a understand that sometimes things are just off.  Over all I would recommend this place for the food and atmosphere especially for downtown chandler."}
{"text":"This place is unreal. Everything from the appetizers, entrees, desert, and drinks. HIGHLY recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place has been discovered.  The last time we were here it was new and rather empty.  8 months later it is full but flowing.  We were seated without a wait and treated well.  And the food is fantastic.
We had meatloaf and the salmon salad.  They were both overflowing with flavors; lots of layered flavors.  The meatloaf has a slight bacon flavor from the pork belly (yep) but there are so many other subtle tastes that you're left questioning your own definition of meatloaf.
The salmon was at once bright and rich; again with layers, though these not so subtle.  It's a bold sweet winning combination on a bed of tender kale with a hint of mint.  It's worth a visit on its own."}
{"text":"Love this place! We stopped in early on Saturday. We were able to catch the end of the games and listen to classic rock. 

We ordered the edamame. It was awesome!!! Soy sauce with fresh basil and green onions. We finished up with the meatloaf dinner. Just like Mom used to make....only better. Meatloaf, creamy potatoes and green beans, cooked perfectly. 

Super service! We'll be back to try the fried chicken."}
{"text":"Sensational! From the pork belly pops to the ain't your mamas chicken and finish it off with a fabulous funnel cake! Call it the grand tour! Great service too! See you again soon but not soon enough."}
{"text":"Always Fun, always treat us great.   Fun atmosphere, good service, good drinks, Great Drinks!"}
{"text":"Wednesday must not be their busy night.  Beautiful decor and warm energy.  Nice big bar service.  Seems to appeal to a higher income and sophisticated crowd, at least for tonight.  Decent wine selection but could open more by the glass.  
Ordered the Pork chops and a dinner salad.  Someone in the kitchen doesn't know what that means...I was served a huge,but fresh and tasty mix of greens, tomatoes and peppers, but it was too much. 
The PC was a little overdone but tasty.  I'm a big eater and i thought the portion was a little shy of 8ozs.  Shut down the spinach--... too soupy for my buds.  Overall Sasha's needs more work to compete in this tough market but I'm not unsatisfied."}
{"text":"PROS
-pork belly lollipops!! ordered HH version that had 3, more than enough for 1 person
-HH is 3-7 which is nice
-thin cut curly fries with the aioli and ketchup
-the new restaurant is styled beautifully

CONS
-Arrived a little early before our rezzie, place was empty but no hostess out front
-The ginger soup was just average, not a ton of flavor in my opinion but was served with rice rice"}
{"text":"Great new restaurant! Amazing service, staff was on top of everything. Loved the food, the cocktails and the atmosphere. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Downtown Chandler for dinner and saw this place and decided to give it a try.  We had a great time and stayed for about 5 hours enjoying ourselves.  A great place and food was amazing."}
{"text":"The meatloaf here is incredible. I'm not sure what the sauce was but it was just slightly spicy and it really made it delicious! Served on a very pretty patterned plate. The dessert options were great so we got two- the frozen chocolate sticks and the champagne sorbet, both amazing! Great service and great food!"}
{"text":"Great Chandler find. Stumbled across just walking through downtown. 

Customer service was outstanding!!  Bartender / server was great!

I stuck with a simple meal:
Spicy tomato soup - yummy!
Chicken drums - specially prepared!!
Madness cures sanity glass of wine - recommended red blend that was fantastic.  

Finally the shoestring fries with dipping sauce topped it off. I will be back."}
{"text":"Met some friends here on a Saturday night. Excellent customer service and nice atmosphere. I had the salmon bruschetta. Very tasty. I really would like to come back and try some more things on the menu. Some of my friends had the meatloaf, and they were very happy with it. 

The meat and cheese board looked delicious!
I am definitely going back!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing!!! We were from San Diego and I loved the hospitality we got. The food was amazing! I got the burger and the curly fries with the aioli, and it was to die for!! If I'm ever in AZ again I'm definitely going back! 
I also really loved the ambiance, the tables were all so lovely decorated and everything just meshed well together."}
{"text":"Noticed a new restaurant in downtown Chandler, at least new to a couple of us, and decided to walk through to check it out. Immediately greeted by a friendly young man who provided us with history of the building and showed us menus. We left but returned 15 minutes later for a cocktail. Seated quickly and water brought to us. Then we waited and waited. . . For someone to at least take our drink order. Only seemed to be one person waiting on tables and making cocktails although the young man who greeted us earlier and two others were sitting at the bar. Flagged him down and he came over to wait on us. Ordered our meal and more drinks. Drinks were delivered but not more water as requested. Food was delivered a short time later. Food was very good as were our cocktails. Still waiting on water. No one came to check on our meal quality. Had to ask for check. Restaurant was very nice, comfortable, and clean. Food was delicious. Waiter was very friendly and helpful. Management needs to have more help to provide quality service to customers."}
{"text":"It could not have been more perfect. Beautiful restaurant with fantastic outdoor space and great service. 

I ordered the VB Steak, it was absolutely fantastic, full of flavor and  cooked to perfection. We were equally impressed with the Osso Bucco, the meat was incredible tender and flavorful. 

Make sure you try the funnel cake for desert you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We can with a group of seven with high expectations from the recommendations of the staff at Puro just a few doors down. (Great atmosphere for a cigar and a drink by the way) and after the appetizers we as a group we're really impressed so we pushed on and tried everything that was recommended, Pork Belly Lollipops and the fried chicken and silky mashed potatoes were incredible. We finished it off with the funnel cake and toppings. We will be back. All around best food and service in downtown Chandler."}
{"text":"Downtown Chandler just keeps getting better! I love this new spot! My husband and I went out on a Saturday evening and anticipated a long wait regardless of where we went - however VB Lounge was open with much availability. The inside look was very clean, open and modern. The staff was fantastic and very attentive. 

We ordered two appetizers and an entree to share: burrata and prosciutto, maple glazed brussel sprouts and the pork chop. Each dish was absolutely amazing and had a very unique flavors. We enjoyed each dish so much it would be hard to to go back and try something different. I would definitely recommend giving this place a visit - you'll be pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"After seeing great Yelp reviews, I was excited to take my wife here for a date night (very rare for us with an infant daughter at home). We had reservations on a Friday night, and we're seated upon arrival. We probably caught them on a bad night, as they were clearly understaffed with wait staff and no acting hostess. We got there before 6pm, so the HappyHour menu was still available to us. My wife really liked her \"make your own\" martini. We ordered a few appetizers. The hummus was okay. The pork belly lollipops were very tender and flavorful. The salmon bruschetta was bland and the bread was too soggy. We skipped the main courses due to the service delays (had a movie to get to) in order to try the highly praised funnel cake with dipping sauces. It was okay. I liked the yellow sauce (tasted like butterscotch) and the red/strawberry sauce. The chocolate tasted odd - almost burnt. My wife joked that they would've been better off serving Nutella. Overall, we just weren't impressed. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't worth coming back to do again. I don't blame the staff that night for the slow service (our waitress was covering about half of the tables in the restaurant right as the dinner rush arrived). I can imagine that on a fully staffed night, or a slower weekday evening, the entire ambiance would've been different."}
{"text":"This was our first visit!
We had a fantastic experience.  The food was really good, but Nicholi was the BEST.  He was attentive but not intrusive. 

There were 7 of us, 3 kids/4 adults. The tempo of the service was comparable to European atmosphere. The wait staff was available ALWAYS, BUT YOU never felt rushed.  And on a Saturday night that is not the norm In downtown Chandler! 

Thank you!"}
{"text":"Bad food, bad service, poor management, poorly trained staff.  Has potential but falls short with below average food and high prices.  Bartenders and staff doing shots.  Drunk guy at bar bothering patrons.  Menu was limited as they were out of their market fish, market mussels.  It's was 6:30 on a Saturday night.  Sasha was yelling at staff in front of guests.  Staff had no idea what table numbers were and guests were getting wrong food.  Too many options to choose from in this area.  Save your money and go somewhere else"}
{"text":"First visit to Sasha's for my wife and I as we are new to the chandler area.  Was A Friday at 6pm and was 3rd restaurant we tried as the others had over an hour wait. We were able to get seated immediately and we ordered drinks and an appetizer. They were good, we ordered dinner. I went out on a limb and ordered \"Gladys Meatloaf\" sounded good... My wife ordered Cauliflower Chicken salad. The meatloaf was dry and what I best could describe as sage'y the mashed potato's was a mear smear on the plate with five green beans over the top.  The 5 Green beans were good! I did not finish the meatloaf. My wife's salad had grilled chicken that was way over done and dry. She had me try a bite and yea, dry as dirt. Neither of us finish ed our dinner and the waitress picked up the plates and as she wisked them away said I hope everything was to your liking. No real concern I think or even asked if we wanted to take home but I expect she knew as well I i now know why there was no wait to get in when All the other places were over an hour.  3 stars were more for the drinks and Meat/Cheese board app we had not the dinner.  1 star there..."}
{"text":"The bestie and I came here for happy hour. We came during the week so it wasn't packed at all to get a table. I believe their happy hour is from 3-7 Monday to Friday, but don't quote me on that! Their website doesn't specify. 

For drinks, I ordered a Cosmo martini, it was good. I think they should make it a bit stronger for my taste. 

For food we ordered the pork belly lollipops, edamame,  the curly fry stack, and I think my friend ordered the goat cheese tartine. Everything was a good portion and I really liked the pork belly. My Friend said that she felt the tartine was a bit dry and would taste better with some sort of sauce. 

Our server was great and very knowledgeable, he used to be a bartender so that really helped! I think their menu is a bit small, but I would definitely come back for happy hour!"}
{"text":"I stopped by another local place VB Lounge ...this place is very nice and the staff is friendly  seated me and took my order right away ...Now the best part.. I ordered the VB Steak it was cooked to perfection and the price was a good value ...So it was like finding a diamond in the ruff ...I will be back ...Cheer's Bluesman Mike"}
{"text":"I wouldn't give even a star for this joke ridiculous establishment. Poorly managed overly priced with below mediocre food. They need experienced professionals to run this proficiently."}
{"text":"Food was great but we were charged full price today for happy hour priced apps. Always check your bill folks."}

We were invited here on a beautiful Saturday night to celebrate a special guy's birthday... or was it for my birthday?  No one really knows but regardless, it was a fun night!  There were bottles of wine, whiskey mules, beer, tapas, bruschetta... it was a whirlwind of food and booze and our waiter, Anthony, was a rockstar!  

What can be said?  The food had bold flavors, the cocktails were strong, and the music got us all in a Vegas mindset.  I enjoyed some succulent melt-in-your-mouth pork belly and a nicely cooked lamb chop.  The salmon bruschetta had a surprise preparation, or maybe I didn't read the menu clearly, that ended up being fantastic.  We washed everything down with a few glasses of vanilla wine [although I still think I detected cigarette ash in my sip but maybe I was just inhaling some secondhand smoke].

Sasha's is a hodgepodge of a diverse clientele.  We saw ladies celebrating a baby shower, a rowdy group of people watching the Dodgers vs Diamondbacks game, and a group of Yelpers ripping apart meatlo --- oh wait, I was looking at the mirror.  Either way, it was a fun atmosphere at Sasha's!  Sasha's feels like a modern day speakeasy with less Art Deco influences and more hipster lighting.  Oh, and I wonder what it takes to be seated upstairs.  I'm willing to bet you have to be connected to the mob!

{"text":"Ok, I don't understand the good reviews, with all the other amazing places near by.  We ordered food at 9:40, the place was 1/16 full.  We needed our food to go since our daughter was on the way home.  We ordered and everyone disappeared.  This was my third visit, and it will be my final.  Great space, horrible restaurant and wait staff.  Wait the 25 minutes and eat at The Brickyard.  This place is a joke.  Don't waste your time.  I tried three time for serious disappointment.  They should stick to making glasses."}
{"text":"This has been the worst experience at a restaurant /bar in Avery long time. We waiting an hour and 15 minutes and never got the borrata and prosciutto appetizer because they still had not made it! So we cancelled the order and asked for the manager. Our poor server told us \"he was now cooking and too busy to come talk to us\". Apparently repeat clients are unimportant. We will never come back! We ended up ordering food online for delivery so we could eat our family dinner before 9:00. Simply awful experience!"}
{"text":"I've been here for brunch and for dinner. This is a hidden gem in Chandler! The food is great and reasonably priced and the decor is beautiful. My only suggestions would be that there be fresh fruit for the breakfast items and a brunch mimosa special is always fun! At any rate I look forward to returning soon!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant in downtown Chandler.  The food and drinks were excellent!!  Loved the pork belly!!  Service was perfect and patio dining was relaxing.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, solid beer selection, and a cocktail menu that isn't just vodka and juice in a martini glass."}
{"text":"We are regular customers at a restaurant next door. Since there wasn't a sign up outside, we didn't even notice this place until we walked by few weeks ago. We couldn't be any happier to give it a try. 

The restaurant is definitely well decorated, very open and spacious with tall ceiling. The bar area is located in the middle of the restaurant with lots of TV hanging up at the top. If you want to enjoy the beautiful weather of Arizona, watching sports while enjoying a beer or a glass or wine, this is definitely the place to be.

Since I am a observer, I picked a table in the very back watching everything that was going on. Servers were definitely attentive. They paid attention to all tables  (not just the one they are assigned to). Very friendly, smiley and approachable. When was the last time you met the master chef walking around asking if you enjoy the food???? He certainly did here. We ordered a fried bread for dessert that was heavenly! A smiley bright Young man literally walked by and asked us which one was our favorite dipping sauce (mine is chocolate). We felt so honored to have met him. You could clearly tell he does care if you like his food or not. I also saw 2 co-owners of the restaurants watching the entire operation. They treated their guests with respect...no matter old or young, black or white, yellow or brown....ah...I enjoyed spending my Friday here so much. Apparently, the owners own multiple businesses in the area. They use glasses made by his business. They are beautifully made & you can tell it wasn't one of those cheap one you buy from the regular supermarket. With that said, please don't drop it! Those water glasses are expensive lol. 

For appetizer, we order pork belly & chicken lollipop. For my main entree, I ordered ozzo bucco dish. The meat was so tender it literally falls off the bone. If you've never had it, it almost taste like a pork roast. It goes so well with my glass of wine. And the dessert! OH MY LORD...you have to ask about the fried bread or I promise you you will regret not ordering it. It came right out of the fryer and it's super delicious. You just have to trust me. It's a MUST ORDER item. 

I'll most definitely come back here again."}
