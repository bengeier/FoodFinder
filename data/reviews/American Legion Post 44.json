{"text":"A great place to relax and visit with Veterans of my era and the younger ones.  Wonderful bar and service and can't go wrong for a good reasonably priced lunch.  Try it it you will like it.   William"}
{"text":"A great Legion Post, excellent reasonable food, very congenial members, always make you feel welcome. Always a pleasure to come here. The menu is great, there is music, special events, and terrific cocktail prices. A top notch American Legion Post! Their chef is terrific! Can't beat the steak sandwich, the Reuben, the fries, the soups, for lunch. In fact I have never had a bad meal here. It may not be haute cuisine but the friendliness the reasonable prices and the very nice patio, by the way, make this an A1 Post!!!"}
{"text":"I was on vacation in Scottsdale and spotted the American Legion Post 44 from across the street.  Took a walk over there and just happened to meet the friendliest people on earth.  The food was superb, the drinks excellent and all at an extraordinarily low cost.  I will make sure to stop back on my next trip.  Thank you to all who have served this great country."}
{"text":"I am writing this review on behalf of my mother because she is not a yelper. Here are her comments: On our recent visit to Scottsdale my husband and I visited to post 44. The patrons and bartenders were super friendly and made us East Coasters feel welcome. I would recommend both young and old visiting this post. The drinks are cheap and there is gambling! It's a good place to go to get a drink and make some friends. It's not called the \"best damn post in the west\" for nothing."}
{"text":"Friendliest post in the west !! Visit Scottsdale every year, and have made this our home away from home. Great, fun time, nice staff and members, and always something going on. Bingo, dinner, music and Happy Hours. If you are a vet, or related to one, do yourself a favor and stop by. New friends are just around the corner...God Bless the USA !!"}
{"text":"A friend picked the Old Town Scottsdale AMVETS to celebrate their birthday. I'm stunned to report how delicious the prime rib was. No joke, mouth watering delicious. (I shudder to think how ginormous the larger portion might be.)  The place was *jammed* with families. The regular menu offers a robust day and evening set of options. Good stuff to find so many friendly faces.   Note: Popcorn is free. Come ready to man the old school popcorn maker. I watched an ittie bittie older woman man the station.   She was serious.  The rest of us were not.    This is seriously a good place to visit when in town. They had live music and a great beer selection.   Thank you for the hospitality!"}
