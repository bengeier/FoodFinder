{"text":"Was there for lunch and both my wife and I had very good meals with excellent service."}
{"text":"New location, just opened, though it was worth a try based on reputation.  Way too noisy and OK food, especially for the price.  Next time, I'll choose the Firepit Wood-Fired Grill in the shopping center across the road."}
{"text":"Came looking for breakfast and considered leaving when there was none. I'm sure glad we didn't. Our lunch was awesome! The smoked  buffalo chicken dip was divine and served on hot house made tortillas and warm bread. The strawberry iced tea was perfectly sweetened. My hubby had the turkey club which he loved and I really enjoyed my salmon salad. This is definitely our new spot when we are in the area!"}
{"text":"We dined for my husband's birthday and the food was fabulous!  Food was fast, warm and great presentation.  I had the Shrimp Bowl and he had the Fra Diablo.  Stephanie was our waitress and she was very friendly and helpful with the menu.  I will dine again in the future!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this Africa's more than I did.  First I would like to note that if you plan to go on a weekend when it would be busier call ahead for a reservation.  Both times I went I had no reservation as the stop was not planned and both times I was stuck on the \"porch\".  The main seating of the restaurant is nice but when it's been crazy cold for weeks and I venture out for a meal a little more expensive than all the other restaurants near but I don't necessarily was to sit on everyday porch furniture.   I could tell as others were being seated near by they were thinking the same thing. 

For reference, If you are used to some of the other locations menus this location will different as it is considered a test kitchen.   This particular trip I just had a chicken salad with the base of their salmon salad which has a poppyseed dressing and almond and strawberries.  It was good but nothing special.  

It is close to me so I am sure at some point or another I'll return but when it's my choice there are a lot of other restaurants in the area that I would prefer first."}
{"text":"I've been going to Atrias for years now at different locations and I really hope his location steps it up! The food was fine but the service seemed to be lacking. They are brand new so with time comes skill but maybe they should have hired some Og employees to help transition the newbies? The inside is super modern- totally different then most other atrias - which is awesome ! The wine bottle wall is also a sight to see. There's plenty of parking available! Will definitely try this location again!"}
{"text":"Went to Atria's with family, was seated in the Bar area, ordered and we were waiting and waiting and waiting for our food. Finally we said something to the waiter (who did not know we did not receive our food for over 45 minutes). The waiter went to the kitchen to ask why we had not received our food. The waiter then told my party that there was a problem with the computer  that the kitchen was not receiving orders, but people that were seated 15-20 minutes after we had arrived already received their food, We waited another 25 minutes for the replaced order and the food was sub par."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. We were excited to try this new location, as we have eaten at the Atria's in Murrysville on several occasions. 
It took over 10 minutes to be greeted by the waitress, and there was no wait to be seated. The hostess did not give us the special menu when we were seated, so by the time the waitress finally came to the table we had already made our choices and were ready to order. It took at least 45 minutes for our food to be served. On a positive note, the steak salad was delicious, but under cooked. My husband's steak was overdone and served without the extra charge topping. His potato was dry and inedible. The children's meals were brought out in a timely fashion, but the empty plates sat on the table the entire meal. The waitress seemed to be preoccupied, and never asked if the steaks were prepared well.
I would like to see this restaurant succeed. However, if the service and inability to serve appropriately cooked food continues I doubt it has a future. My discontent would have been expressed to the manager, but she skipped our table. This is my first, and hopefully last, negative complaint on Yelp."}
{"text":"Exceptionally inviting interior, and layout. Great bar area.

 Menu had plenty of good options for a lighter, healthier meal ,or choices that offer the comforts associated with a heartier meal.  It was hard to decide, because everything on the menu would have been a good selection. This was my second visit to an Atria's, so I felt like I had a lot of catching- up to do with diners who frequent this chain, and rave about their seasonal menus. All worth a try.

Our server John, was very attentive, calm, and productive.  He tuned into my comment that this was my first visit to this location, and to my surprise, brought us a complimentary zucchini appetizer.  Nice gesture!

 Food portions were decent and appealing.  I added a salad to my meal for an extra 4.00 and it was a meal in itself.  

Overall it was a pleasant experience and I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"My experience was good. I liked the service, attention of the host Melinda she was very kind and even when it was super full our reservation was respected. The food was tasty and it took the regular time in most restaurants when they are super busy. The variety of choices is good. The place looks nice. They made it cosy by not having just a large big room with 30 tables. It has divided areas great idea. Bar is well situated in the heart of the place. I think his is a great addition to our Neighborhood!! Good luck and keep it up!!"}
{"text":"I'm a picky eater so there was not many items on the menu for me to pick from, but I had the pierogi pizza appetizer and it was amazing!! My husband loved his pot roast something and loved it! Professional and hoity-tioty fancy, but VERY nice staff.  Expensive, but not as much as we thought it would be and very worth it!"}
{"text":"We visited Atria's yesterday  for dinner. I made the reservation at 12:30 pm in person . They seated us within 7 minutes and the food was delicious. The waitress was wonderful and very attentive. Dress code was business casual but really you can go in dressed very casual. I went in with a weiry attitude from alot of bad reviews I read but that was not the case at all. I would definitely go again. Good job staff!"}
{"text":"Myself and my girlfriend go to this one in irwin mostly on Thursday's,  I like the rhaspberry lemonade martinis,  we always sit at bar. Jen and Melissa are normally bartending, they are super nice, very into there work and make awesome drinks, all the staff here treat us very nice, we never have any issues with anything. The sliders are really good , and my girlfriend likes the salad. We have tried many of the food on menu and all was good, also there is plenty of room to park because it's in the plaza, so we normally park close so I can admire my Harley from the window lol...si if you want good service go there, Thursday's are half off martinis."}
{"text":"Great experience at Atria's Norwin! Excellent service by Drew, $4 happy hour wine and 1/2 price small plates. Emily, the manager checked in frequently. Amazing pot roast nachos and fromage. Good friends, good times."}
