{"text":"The \"NEW\" Mighty Oak Barrel
The original Mighty Oak Barrel was one of my favorite restaurants. We were so disappointed upon its closing. What a wonderful surprise it was to hear it reopened, albeit under different ownership. So last night we gave it a try. 

Upon entering there were notable changes, one being the very bare enclosed porch entry...the old had this little area decorated nicely...it was cute and welcoming. Now it is a drab, bare space that does not really give you a sense that the inside would be any better. They need to perk it up. Once inside, it was much brighter than the old place (I was always blind for about 5 minutes in the old place until my eyes adjusted). They removed all the little white Christmas lights that were strewn all about the place, which gave it a cozy feel.  Now it's lit with a little track lighting and overhead recessed lights, with very sparse decor...a little \"cold\" feeling. 

We were seated and given the menus, but no sign of any special martinis or even a wine list. We asked what kind of martinis they had, and our nice but timid (maybe new in the business) server stumbled a bit with her answer and then just said \"regular ones?\" with a little nervous chuckle. I ended up just getting an iced tea, my dinner mate ordered a glass of Chardonnay and the server asked what kind, but since they did not offer a wine list she had no idea what they had so she just said the house wine. It was priced modestly at $4.25. 

The menu is obviously different under the new ownership, and I did overhear a server stating that similar to the old place, it would change seasonally. They did not have dinner entree specials. We proceeded to order calamari as an app which was very good, not rubbery at all, with good flavor. Salads come with dinner and were very nice...a great mix of greens with almonds, apricots, dried cranberries. The unique dressings of the old place were gone. They offer 3 vinaigrettes, blue cheese and avocado ranch. They provided bread which for me was sliced a little thin, not warm, but fresh. 

They now offer a selection of flatbreads and sandwiches and pastas on the menu. We both ordered beef, which was priced nicely in comparison to many restaurants we've been to.  I ordered the New York strip with green peppercorn bourbon glaze. The steak was cooked perfectly medium rare and was tender, but I did not really taste the glaze. My companion ordered the twin filets with blue cheese which she also said were very good.  I missed the style of the old place, which provided special sides to accompany the entrees. Now you choose from a standard selection offered. They offered veg of the day, green beans almandine, herb roasted red potatoes, pasta, rice with beans. I opted for the green beans which were cooked very nicely, but needed seasoning, and the herbed potatoes which were just very basic, kind of non-descrpt. Nothing over the top about either of them.  Other entrees included trout, tuna, a couple chicken dishes, duck...no pork was offered. Bottom line is I found the food to be all in all very good, aside from the sides, which were certainly not bad, but just very blah. We did not order dessert...they had about 5 choices. 

The one thing that was super annoying was the noise level. It's a small place...but the same size as the old place. I don't know how the acoustics could have changed so much, but it was SO loud once all the tables were filled that we had to practically scream across the table to one another. I'm guessing something to do with the decor or lack thereof to absorb some of the noise?  Maybe not, as I know zilch about controlling noise levels lol, but SOMETHING is different. It used to be a place you could go for a quiet dinner, romantic even...I would not say that now. 

So in summary, food was very good, ambience was poor. 4 stars for food, one star for atmosphere and lack of drink or wine list (it IS called the Mighty Oak Barrel after all....and no wine list offered?). We'll most likely go back once a new menu is posted. Worth a try, but don't expect everything to be the same as the old place just because they kept the name."}
{"text":"With humble and almost tacky decor, MOB fools you into thinking you are stepping into a VFW but open your mouth and close your eyes, and you are transported to a Michelin star experience. 

The duck is phenomenal, the salad dressings are inventive. The wine selection is excellent. They know how to do warm service, hair raising food, and lovely wines. 

But please, could you take down the fake vines?"}
{"text":"This is one of the best places to eat in he Pittsburgh area.  Blows away every other place in Oakmont.  Very small but your eating not golfing.  Very good bartenders that can make some great martinis!"}
{"text":"There's nothing mighty about this place.  Wish zero stars were an option because it deserves none!  Our waitress was released from the hospital yesterday (great- please be washing your hands & are you telling me this for a sympathy tip? ), & she forgot our salad orders so had to take them again after our appetizer arrived. Salads were best part of meal,  good dressing.  Within a few minutes of receiving salad,  entrees were delivered. Lobster ravioli tasted bland & possibly frozen.  Caneloni wasn't very tasty & someone in our party sent back their flat bread, although the stuffed peppers were good.  After our below average meal,  we were addressed by the manager on our way out as she asked us next time to let her know our party needed a place \"back in the corner\" because we were having so much fun.  Yes despite your poor service & food our group managed to laugh & have fun.  apparently not acceptable in your restaurant. .. Will. Never. Return."}
{"text":"A few years ago we had a bad experience at the Mighty Oak Barrel and swore never to go back.  At the time, they didn't take reservations and it was very crowded.  While waiting at the bar for an hour, we noticed that many couples and parties coming in after us were being seated before us.  After bringing this to the attention of the hostess, they told us they made a mistake but we still had to wait a while for a table because everything was full.  I know these kinds of mistakes happen, but it really sucks when they do.  Plus, Mighty Oak Barrel is such a small place, I think it would be difficult to lose track of someone waiting for a table.

Well, we were in the neighborhood last weekend and dropped in briefly in between a wedding ceremony and a wedding reception.  We got there right when it opened and it smelled very strongly of bathroom cleaners (I suspect they had just cleaned the bathrooms and the food hadn't started cooking yet).  There's about 10 tables and a U-shaped bar.  We all had the special of the day which was the \"Mighty Martini\" which was a Cosmopolitan-style martini made with grape juice from grapes they grow at the restaurant.  This was a very well made drink.

The bartender (who I think was one of the owners) was cantankerous in a fun way.  She and my brother had a fun time ribbing each other.

The reviewer who mentioned Michelin stars has obviously never been to a Michelin-starred restaurant.  The comparison to a VFW is much more appropriate.  We're still kind of mad about our dinner experience a few years ago, but our most recent experience was positive so perhaps we're give them another shot for dinner some time."}
{"text":"I like this  place a lot.  Grainne and Lisa do a great job with  this little place in Oakmont, PA.  I highly suggest it if you are looking for an out of the way hidden  gem.  I eat here about once or twice a week and had them cater a small event last night.  The service is great and it's the kind of place you can go in with jeans and eat at the bar and not eat bar food.  I highly recommend the duck.  They also do some interesting thing with soups.  Amy is a good bartneder and she'll make you feel right at home.  The only issue that I have with this place is that they try to get a little too \"creative\" with the dishes.  And, often it doesn't work.  I had a halibut dish last week that had a vanilla bean sauce which really was tragic.  I also had a pickled octupus dish (I don't know what I or they were thinking).  Go you will have fun, oh yeah and the wine is good and inexpensive."}
