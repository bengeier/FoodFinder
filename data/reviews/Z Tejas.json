{"text":"I have tried this restaurant many years ago and didn't  have  good experience then. So we thought we would give it another try. We had to wait for a table on the patio. So we went to the bar and ordered a beer and Margarita. The margarita was small and about ten bucks. Then we were seated on the patio that had many tables open. We looked over the menu and finished our drinks. They also charge $5 for chips and salsa.  We were  never acknowledged or asked it we needed anything. We got up and left. We went down the street to Macayos. Where the margaritas were twice the size for $3 less."}
{"text":"Went to ztejas today for lunch. The server was great, I got the happy hour margarita, which are super strong and always delish. Then I ordered the salmon miso with rice and veggies. It was a $19 plate. I asked for the salmon medium rare. As I was eating it I got to the thicker part and it was pretty much uncooked. It wasn't even warm in the middle. Told the waiter and he took the plate back to fix it. When it came back it was my exact same plate with my partial bites in the same place, conclusion they popped it in the microwave! I sucked it up and ate it to realize the rice was hard as well! Awful. When we finished the manager came by to ask how it was. I let him know my salmon was way undercooked and the rice was hard! He said sorry and that he would let the kitchen know. Didn't offer reduced check, dessert or anything. Besides the marg and cornbread it was awful and I can't believe I spent 30 dollars here today. Never going back."}
{"text":"good service, food is always great and the corn bread is a treat!"}
{"text":"Went here about a year ago.  The food was poor.  Had to tell the waiter how to make guacamole.  Had to wait for service longer than usual.  It just wasn't a positive experience.  I wouldn't go back.  Nor would I recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Don't believe the hype! I heard about their \"awesome\" margaritas and decided to give them a shot before leaving Arizona. First, the bartender was an a--hole. I asked for the rita I've been hearing so much about and he serves me some frozen thing with chambord. I told myself this must not be the thing I've heard such ravings about so decided to choke that thing down along with their sad excuse of chicken tortilla soup - which had VERY LITTLE cheese and chicken but plenty of broth that looked like diarrhea. After all of this grossness I asked the bartender for the better rita that is not frozen. He told me that their best ritas WERE the frozen ones. When I heard that I got Z'Hell outta that place.  Can't wait to be back home in Dallas for a REAL rita at Ojeda's and Monica's."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a chain that does not feel like a chain, then you might enjoy this place.  The decor is pretty nice and has a modern upscale casual feel.  They have a lot of seating, so even if there is a wait, it really should not be too bad.  The food is slightly above average.  I would say this is a safe place to bring out of towners or a business lunch, but it is not on my list of favorites.  The cornbread is a great addition to the meal and most of the mixed drinks are good.  The food is good, but nothing on the menu seems to be too memorable.   Again a safe nice place if you are looking for an americanized mexican restaurant.  It has a fairly upscale casual touch to the decor.  Usually any Z is located nearly a shopping district, so I could see this as a good place to go on a shopping day or for some drinks."}
{"text":"Mushroom Enchiladas, YUM!! Might not sound good to some of you, but believe me, these are amazing!! We also got the chips and salsa, which all three versions were a little spicy for me. I like a little spice, but maybe they can tone down the heat drastically on one of the options. Our server was very nice. He was attentive and johnny on the spot with everything. I have been here one other time, also for a business lunch, and I am still a major fan. I need to get back to this place next time I'm in Tempe and try a famous margarita!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints me. This is the first time I went during their Bloody Mary bar for Sunday brunch. The service was immaculate, the food was awesome, especially the grilled pork my wife had....it had excellent flavor. I must say, I made a really good Bloody Mary. Their baked goods like the muffin I had and the cornbread my guests had were DELICIOUS. The waitress was excellent as by brother-in-law asked if the burgers were messy and she picked up on the hint and brought him a \"messy\" burger with LOTS of BBQ sauce. To top it off, the hostess sat us under the flag of my home state.....TEXAS!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for 15 years, and ZT always delivers. Stopped in last night. Super attentive bartender alerted me to happy hour specials. Pork chile verde with fresh tortillas and black beans, along with homemade cornbread and honey butter in a skillet for $8. The chile verde is real deal, the glob of cheese on top needs to go, however. Good selection of craft brews, rare for a Southwestern eatery."}
{"text":"I rarely say holy moly, but holy moly brunch, people. Shared the ahi chipotle citrus bites and the catfish beignets among several people, and both were write-home-about delicious. I had the stuffed french toast all to myself and I'm pretty sure everyone who writes a positive review about stuffed anything makes this joke, but afterwards I was the stuffed one. Luckily everything else I had planned that day involved sitting quietly, digesting and meditating on the meaning of life. The meaning of life on Sunday is good brunch, so the circle was unbroken."}
{"text":"I enjoyed Z tejas the other night for the first time. Being new here i had to learn whats good and whats not. So i started picking a new place everytime. So far out of the dozen or so places ive eaten it ranks up near the top. First of all the atmosphere is very inviting. The service was reasonably quick but not to quick to where you cant enjoy the conversation before the meal. The staff was also very friendly and accommodating. Now to the food. I ordered the diablo pasta and was rather impressed at how tasty it was. It was how it seems..... spicy. I really enjoyed the place just wish the drinks were made a lil stronger. Overall it was a good experience and would recommend it to others."}
{"text":"We knew we wanted tacos so we did a search for best tacos. Great reviews. I called and got great answers to all my questions. When we arrived we were serviced by Erica. She even went out of her way to ask the chef to make out meals extra spicy. She was bright and kind with a great attitude.  Our food was so much more than I extended in flavor and presentation. Delicious to the last bite.  I will be returning many more times!"}
{"text":"Great outdoor patio with attentive staff. We had a few drinks and then tried the seafood enchiladas and grilled salmon. I know what you are thinking: seafood in Arizona? Still the enchiladas, though covered in a few too many layers and sauces, were tasty and the salmon was cooked perfectly.  Without knowing much about the restaurant scene here, i lucked out and would definitely go back. And when you are done just go across the street and have a cigar!!!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I were visiting ASU and tried it hoping for the best, we were not disappointed!  I had the fish tacos and she had the wild mushroom enchiladas.  We both couldn't stop praising our meals, not to mention the cornbread that was the best we ever ate.  Service was excellent and atmosphere was great. We sat outside and enjoyed the great weather.  We will definitely be going back once she starts school there in the fall.   The only complaint I would have is that when I ordered Jack on the rocks, it was the smallest pour I had ever received in a bar/restaurant. (very minor, prob. not worth mentioning)"}
{"text":"Yes, it's a chain. But it's a Texas chain that opened it's first restaurant on 6th Street in Austin. That's street cred in my book. I've been to all their Austin locations, but now frequent the one off Mill Avenue in Tempe. Went for lunch just this afternoon as a matter of fact, and it always amazes me how I forget how good the food is between visits, even the complimentary corn bread. Today I ordered the Blackened Catfish Tacos with black beans and rice. Yum. I also recommend the Wild Mushroom Enchiladas and Baked Seafood Enchiladas."}
{"text":"They have a great menu. But there is no flavor on most of them. Environment is great. Hope they are not giving pre cooked re heated food to their customers."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch with some friends, we were pleasantly surprised at the quality. The Bloody Mary bar was awesome! Food was nice and fresh, and very tasty. Would definitely come here again next time we are in Tempe."}
{"text":"Seriously? This will pass for mexican food in Arizona? I have had better mexican food in Akron, OH.  Stay away from and find a street cart, seriously.  Nothing else to say but, yeck!"}
{"text":"Good food. Decent service. Short wait. The waiter was cool about my daughter sending her salad back because it was too spicy for her."}
{"text":"There were 6 of us and we had a ball. The food was great and the margaritas super tasty. Definitely a repeat in the works."}
{"text":"I love Z'Tejas, but this location seems to be lacking. I've tried it two or three times now and the food just doesn't taste as good as the Chandler location. I'm not sure what the difference is exactly. Great margaritas though!"}
{"text":"Food was good but kind of pricy! I enjoyed the happy hour which comes with corn bread that was amazing."}
{"text":"We came over to Z-Tejas after encountering a very unpleasant experience at another restaurant/bar.  Everyone was so inviting when we arrived and Corina was exceptional!  We frequent your location on Chandler, but will be back here often.  Thanks for still allowing us to have a Sunday Funday!"}
{"text":"Excellent appetizers, salads, tacos and margaritas! The frozen margaritas are VERY strong and delicious (I am not a frozen margarita fan but they came highly recommended by the waiter). Yum! But be careful--they sneak up on you. The food is fresh and consistently delicious. Reasonably priced -- more than we wanted to spend but worth every penny."}
{"text":"Went for Valentines Day and was disappointed. Our food was okay, but service stunk. Our waitress was not very friendly and we witnessed other tables waiting for several minutes to receive their drinks or even be greeted in one case. That table was there for 10 minutes with no greet. Our waitress spilled a water, which I understand was an accident, but the staff left the spill right there on the floor by our table for at least 20 minutes until a manager came up and asked if the roof was leaking. Lucky for them no one slipped and fell. We were not the only table talking about it. Unfortunately our experience will not lead us back there. I had heard good things, but definitely an off night."}
{"text":"Ambient is very nice, celing is high... I only ordered the tortilla soup... It was spicy for me and I did not eat it. The waitress just said since it was too spicy for you, You wont be charge for that. Thank you waitress, you made my day The cornbread will not desapoint you!!!"}
{"text":"Rude bartender, not willing to accommodate a request for tomato juice, she would have to open a large can to give a small amount, made my friend feel like very unwelcome. On our way to BLT Steak for a real dinner..."}
{"text":"Heavily disappointed when me and my friends went there for lunch. I got the distinct impression the food is pre-packaged when I asked if I could order the mushroom enchiladas a la carte. The waitress said it wasn't possible and that I would have to get the full plate. I  wanted to specify, so I asked if it was impossible to just  get a couple of enchiladas....and she said it comes with rice and beans.....Arghhh! What's the deal? But the food was good and she was on top of the refills. But then dessert came around! And so she regaled me with all their desserts and they all sounded good, so I chose the berry cobbler. She said it was her favorite and I was craving some healthy additions to a possibly decadent dessert! So there we waited....30 minutes for that freakin' cobbler! And guess what? No berries!!!! It was an apple cobbler!!!! Now that I think about it, I should have talked to the manager, but after waiting so long and keeping all my friends there, I felt like I was forced to eat it. So yeah, I'm not sure I want to go back anytime soon!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place, unusual twists on food, great happy hour.parking can be an issue in Tempe but they have valet service. Do not miss this place!"}
{"text":"The food was very tasty, the wait was not. But the staff made up by trying their best to accommodate us. Prices in my opinion are at the medium range. 4 people= $110 dollars"}
{"text":"The food wasn't too bad, but it wasn't anything astounding either- particularly for the price you pay. I'd give it four stars if the prices were cheaper.  Cornbread is pretty great though!"}
{"text":"Tried the Z'Tejas brunch for the first time today. Yummmmm. Check out the self-serve blodymary bar when you walk into the dining room - lots of options. We chhose the mimosas with fresh squeezed oj. Before they bring your entrees, you get a muffin and berry sorbet with fresh berries. The eggs benedict is good - very fresh - but it's MUCH better with the chipotle hollaindaise instead of the regular stuff. The chicken and potato hash is pretty great and I've heard good things about the breakfast enchiladas. I think most locations offer brunch on Saturday and Sunday from 10a to 3p."}
{"text":"This place was horrible! I will never go back it was over priced and the best thing I ate was the corn bread you get  before the meal.  I had the chorizo stuffed tenderlion it was like chewing on a piece of rubber stuffed with soy. My girl freind had  flavorless tacos with stale corn tortillas. three  words it sucked, sucked, sucked!"}
{"text":"Good food but not the same since they discontinued their bloody mary and mimosa bar.  Used to be the best brunch option in central phoenix but without the bar it's just another Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"What a disappointment yesterday. We wanted to have a late dinner and drinks after the football game and that wasn't possible at the Tempe z-Tejas. I love the location in Scottsdale so we thought this would be a solid spot to patronize.   We were seated in the corner like they didn't want us there. But this allowed for us to watch the timeline and activities in the area. They started filling in the tables and actually moved other patrons after they had been seated so they could accommodate another table?? Those folks were more polite, I felt this inconsiderate to their experience. On the subject of other patrons another table did better by getting their drinks from the bar. Our server was too busy standing at the server station, \"looking busy\". He wasn't, trust me, I was a server for years. Not a good habit when the computer is in guest view.   The female server in the area was on top of things and folks who were sat after us had drinks, cornbread and soup. We had asked for lemons twice to no avail, because our server never came back to our table by that time. The one thing we managed to receive was the \"hard day\" margaritas. These were over poured with alcohol and didn't taste good.   It came down to the unfortunate situation of snagging a manager from a runner. I informed him of the deplorable service and he offered to be our server. It was so long at that point I couldn't stay. It was insulting. The manager comp'd our drinks and said we were are free to go. Like we were being removed from prison. At this point I was so irritated I would have preferred a more professional phrase, such as I'm sorry for the poor service, etc. The server never introduced himself, never even looked us in the eye or took care of us and his other tables in the slightest. Here is your tip: do not work in a college town at a place where people will come late at night if you can't be polite. It's part of the job. Maybe find a job where you don't serve people because you are not good at that."}
{"text":"A little bit of Austin and Heaven down in Tempe!! I had the chicken-articoke stack, and it was Amazing!! Always great food and great service."}
{"text":"right near the heart of the university, it's basically a chevy's plus plus.  i will give them an extra star for the service.  my work colleague said that when i valeted my car they would just \"run out to meet me and park it for me\"... i didn't know he meant LITERALLY.  they ran like they were in a race, despite the lack of traffic behind me.  go Team Z!   the waitresses was likewise also very service oriented.  the outside seating was perfect weather which normally i suspect it isn't because of the cold in the winter and heat in the summer, but i hit it right on the head as far as good weather.    the steak salad was pretty decent.  obviously, we're not looking for gourmet here.  we're looking for a strong showing in the \"solid, reliable, good ingredients\" and i think it makes the cut there.   the chips were good as well as the really nice corn bread they service complimentary.  my friend's enchilada's look great too.  so it beats chevy's from my perspective.  as far as reliable food with good service near the university, this looks like a very good choice."}
{"text":"Interesting place.  I walk in thinking it was more of a Mexican restaurant.  However the menu is a bit all over.  All and all decent food but I probably wouldn't go back as a tourist with all the other options.  Pros:  Great location and patio.  The staff was also friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Wanted breakfast in Tempe before a day football game. (Long lines!) we walked in just after they opened and got seated right away. When we asked about the breakfast menu we were told they were only serving lunch that day. We were clearly disappointed, but within minutes of hearing the news, a manager showed up, apologized deeply, offered us special gift certificates for our inconvenience then had the kitchen crack a couple eggs for a bacon and egg dish for my wife! I had the nachos which were a great meal size portion. And who doesn't like fresh cornbread?!? Service was on point despite the large crowd.  I'm not normally a big fan of any 'chain' type restaurants, but when the customer service levels exceed anything I can think of, I'll be back as well as refer friends and family. Thank you Z-Tejas!"}
{"text":"It was ok.  Place looked dirty.  Wait staff was slow to serve.  Would not return."}
{"text":"Burger was dry, fries good, enchilda that my friend ordered was not good. SERVICE was OUTSTANDING!"}
{"text":"This place is great for large groups since they have an awesome happy hour!  I love the street tacos plate, chambord margarita and can't forget the cornbread YUM! A must go when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Really enjoy food here. Severs are courteous and food is just simply awesome. Good for lunch meetings or informal gathering of friends/ family too.  I am a vegetarian. I really like Z'Tejas Trio (chips + cheese +salsa and guacamole) - good for 3-4 people and for main course I like their signature pasta.  If you have never been to this place, it is a must try!  Enjoy \m/"}
{"text":"It was our first time there, and the General Manager had given each free tostadas for the occasion, which he lovingly dubbed a \"moosh boosh\" of flavor! Best street tacos in the area by far!"}
{"text":"Went out to celebrate my sisters birthday..first timer they treated us great..great food will return again"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places. When I am doing training in tempe I bring the new employees here for dinner and lots of drinks. Went here on a Saturday at 1:45 and all they offered was a brunch menu. Paid for our drinks and walked across the street to Whisky Row for lunch at 2:00."}
{"text":"service was very quick,  had a pork pepper meal and there was enough to feed two. corn bread served with the meal. spacious and easy playing music.  Inside very cool and waitress prompt."}
{"text":"Waiting forever for a table but the place was half full.  Waited forever for drinks and apps. Food was ok. Bathrooms were not stocked and filthy. The temper location of this brand has issues. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Came down for a ASU game and got sat down at 430 and wait over 1 hour to get my appetizer and it's now 6pm and just got our COLD food. Very unhappy"}
{"text":"Service and food were both great. I ordered the small enchilada seafood lunch plate that comes with your choice of soup or salad. It was the perfect size, tons of flavor! A small handful of rice and black beans. I ordered the chicken tortilla soup and that was great as well.   Don't order ice water however, it taste like dirt."}
{"text":"Came with a friend for happy hour and have to say I enjoyed their drinks. We had the Chambora margaritas and they were delicious with just enough of a kick. Our waitress was very friendly too."}
{"text":"Was in town for the day and had a late lunch here.  For a Saturday afternoon it wasn't crowded at all but then again I was there well after a normal lunch crowd and before an early dinner crowd.    The food was very good.  The corn bread was some of the best I've had and the frozen margarita was very good as well.  I had the Chicken Burrito and it was amazing.  The flavor was very good and the chicken was very tender and flavorful.   It had a bit of a kick to it but not bad.  I don't come out this way that often but if I find myself back in town I would certainly come back her again."}
{"text":"Jerk Chicken Salad is awesome. Margaritas on the rocks with salt, delicious. Cool space, high ceilings, good for groups, great for happy hour. Time for siesta. :)"}
{"text":"Had good food and great service but portions were kinda small for price, maybe I just ordered the wrong item."}
{"text":"This is a typical Tex-Mex eatery.   The tropical guava mojitos are divine here!! The menu is fairly diverse. Mostly mexican dishes but there are salads and pastas with a spicy kick to them.  The table side guacamole is delicious but not worth the $10. (especially since it's considered an appetizer)  Entrees average around $12-16.   A very spacious location, so great for groups. I've heard their happy hour is great. Will try that next time. Parking is limited but there is a valet outside."}
{"text":"The food and service are good. I just can't say I was wowed my experience here."}
{"text":"Way to go Sean (aka PM Bar 1)!   Sat at the bar before our show at the Gammage. Free appetizer, great service (serious, appreciate it), good drinks and tasty food. Recommended for sure.   Chambord margarita, barbacoa enchiladas."}
{"text":"I like Z-Tejas, but I just can't get past the just average seafood enchiladas.  It's short on taste, short on seafood, and big on spinach and other filler. See Barrio and Tradiciones for kick ass seafood enchiladas.  The decor is very upscale chainy, but I dig the AZ, NM, TX flags...it's a nice display even though it is designed to remind you you're at a Southwestern place.  Subtlety, everyone, subtlety.  Since then I've ordered differently.  You can't go wrong with their chicken avocado sandwich.  But I do have top say, I get excited thinking about the queso, cornbread and the catfish beignet.  I don't know what they do to the catfish or the beignet crustorama, but it makes me giddy come time for each Z-Tejas visit.  As for the cornbread, I'll second Max's comment about it.    I can't speak to the margaritas though....since I'm usually there for business lunches or business dinners.  Hiccup, um what was that, boss?"}
{"text":"Missed the happy hour but  the Margaritas were not expensive. Waited for an outside table but had to wait inside because you are not permitted to wait outside with a drink in hand. .( As an aside saw 2 arrests on Mill Ave after dinner becuse 2 guysgot caught drinking beer not so carefully disguised in brown bags.) Well worth it on a beautiful night.Great for people watching. Yes, cornbread is good but the nachos with 3 types of salsa was better. My entree was a chicken, mushroom artichoke stack. Decent but not fabulous. My wife's mushroom enchillada was better. ."}
{"text":"Very disappointed for Mother's Day! I've been going to Z'tejas for their Mother's Day brunch for several years and they got rid of it! They have their regular brunch menu and no Mimosa and Bloody Mary bar! No Mother's Day Photo and I called a few days before and was told they are still doing the Mother's Day Brunch! Service was terrible! This place used to be so packed and it was dead! Now I know why! We will not be going back! I told my husband and kids I want a new Mother's Day brunch place next year!! We're thinking Crackers is the place!!"}
{"text":"i've sampled the z-tejas fish (and it's fabulous), the southwestern salad (and it's great), and burgers (which are finely cooked) but it's the tortilla soup that keeps me coming back for more. they will add as much avocado as you want and always give you extra cheese in the fist-fulls (when you ask for it). i should also mention that they have a great selection of flavored teas. my most recent visit wasn't very positive, as it took too long to seat us (for whatever reason, they changed my party of 5 to a party of 6) i pointed this out after 20-some-odd minutes of waiting and were seated immediately. the tortilla soup wasn't all that good and the service was so-so, although no one complained. i would continue to frequent this place if i lived in tempe."}
{"text":"The happy hour is great and well worth the trip.  The free cornbread is served hot and  is worth the visit. We've been here several times and never had a bad meal."}
{"text":"We were enjoying a wonderful margarita when we saw a flight of margaritas go past.  So...we ordered 2 flights (6 total little glasses) labeled them and started a serious taste test.  Our wonderful bartender, Daniel, assisted us.  The winner in the taste test was the Patron margarita.  We enjoyed those little shrimp tostada as we tasted.  Soooo good."}
{"text":"My wife and I have dined here hundreds of times and it never disappoints. Most recently we went on Valentines Day and for the first time ever they took longer than normal for the food to come out for obvious reasons. We didn't have to say a thing, every manager came to our table and apologized on their own. At the end of the dinner they took care of the whole bill. That is a first class experience IMO, the food is of course excellent as well."}
{"text":"Great service by Allison; TERRIBLE food!  Took over 40 min to get awful, cold food.  Spoke to mgr, who never came to table, and only offered dessert as compensation.  \"Banana muffin\" was vanilla cream cupcake?"}
{"text":"On my last visit to Tempe last Friday the 5th of December, myself and my business partner dined at z Tejas. After having marginal service we were less than impressed. We both ordered the Rib Eye steak which was sub par at best. Shortly after leaving I became extremely sick, vomiting as well as, becoming dizzy and disoriented. It got so bad that I had to go to Tempe St. Luke's Hospital. After being immediately wheel back into the ER I was treated for Severe Dehydration and Food Poisoning. The PA on staff who treated me stated that it is very possible that it came from the food i had at Z Tejas. Needless to say I'm very disappointed in the professional standards of this restaurant. This was a place in California that I frequented and enjoyed. After my last experience with food poisoning after eating here sadly I will never return to the restaurant. I caution all patrons to be aware of your food while eating here and if you do choose to dine here make sure your food is prepared appropriately. Hopefully upper management will address this issue and eradicate what ever problem is responsible for causing it. Thank you for Reading"}
{"text":"Best dinner ever!!! Horrible service at el hefe and decided to come here for their amazing margaritas. They did not disappoint. To start it off;  Nate came up after we were seated to say hello and grab drinks. He was absolutely delightful and handsome. Then our server Samie gave the best vibes!!! Steered us in the right direction and offered the specials. One of our friends had the citrus tequila ribs...Amazing!!!!! My friend and I shared two desserts. The apple cobbler is made to order and delish!!!!! I do not go to a lot of chain restaurants often, but let me tell you it is not a disappointment. They have multiple stores for a reason. The food and the service was so on point!!! Can't wait to go back and ask for Samie!!!"}
{"text":"Things were not as great the 2nd time around here as we took a break from the Arts Festival for lunch. They have a lunch menu, but only three items seem to be discounted and those were smaller plates of enchilidas. The green chile beef enchilada was deemed not good and was served with poor tasting rice. The order of fajitas ($13) for me were average. Some of the achiote chicken pieces were fatty and that is unacceptable for fajitas and tortillas were luke warm.   The highlight of this meal was the $3 Cornbread appetizer. Real corn was involved and the hot cake melted that butter to perfection, but it could use some green chili to spice things up a bit. It's been awhile, but the HH menu offers less friendly discounts also than a few years ago."}
{"text":"Went here with a party of 12 on a Thursday night. Everyone was happy with meals and drinks. I had a chicken pasta dish with sun dried tomatoes and capers and it was excellent. I definitely recommend it for people visiting asu."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while and service not good tonight.  Husband had to go in to flag someone down for water after a long wait, an abnormally long wait on the patio.  It wasnt even busy so after the waitress made initial visit to our table she didnt come back to check on us for a really long time so food was going cold.  finally she came when I was 3/4 of the way finished but I tried to eat slower than the slow I already eat so that I could get the green salsa that I love.  After a really long wait maybe 15 minutes and honestly I think it was more like 20 she comes back with hot enchilada sauce.  I was so upset now because the whole meal was just crap cold and soggy since we had to wait so long in between each visit.  Finally she comes back and I tell her she brought wrong sauce and that I would like the green salsa please.  Again after a really long wait she finally brings the right thing.  Anyway it was yuck and it was cold, and soggy and not fun sorry I already said that.  I used to go here all the time but the visit prior to this one almost the same thing happened.  I had a cold wet soggy burrito by the time I got my salsa.  That was in May and i used to go at least once a week.  So since that last awful visit in May 7 months later I try again and wow it was the same and worse.  Bummer, used to love this place."}
{"text":"i wouldn't normally give an uninspired chain restaurant a Five Star rating, but i just love their brunch specials and big patio.  one of my favorite weekend ventures is getting friends and cruisers together to pedal to a local patio for some eats and drinks when the weather's nice, and this place is perfect for that.  it's tempe, so there's plenty of places to lock your bike within viewing distance from the joint's huge patio. it's right off mill, so there's plenty of people watching, and it seems like every other weekend there's a festival of some sort, too.  the brunch is sundays from 11 to 2, and breakfast options are as basic as eggs benedict (pretty good) to breakfast enchiladas (also spectacular). you also get muffins or cornbread to snack on that are excellent.  the best part is the drink specials, $3 mamosas and $3 bloody marys buffet. yeah, that's right, a buffet just for your perfect, do-it-yourself bloody mary. they have three or four mixes to choose from, like straight up tomato juice to their special spicy jalepeno blend. then you can add as much ice, veggies and fun stuff as you want. they have several different kinds of olives and why not throw in a beef jerky stick to stir it up? did i mention that for $3 you have your choice of top shelf vodka? i know, this is too good to be true, but it is. they have kettle one, skyy, absolut, you want it, they got it.  you're starting to understand why i would rather bike than drive up there, i hope. anyway, the crowd is so-so, but with a big group of friends, some sunshine and bicycles, it's pretty fantastic way to end a weekend."}
{"text":"Upon moving to AZ, we tried Z'Tejas and I was not a fan.  I can't say why exactly - the food just didn't do much for me.    I gave it another shot recently and I'm a convert!  My smoked chicken quesadilla was delish and they have a great drink menu (I had a watermelon concoction with black sea salt).  Staff was great!"}
{"text":"Great service, food and atmosphere. Interesting flavor combos. Drinks were very good."}
{"text":"Our experience was exactly the same as Patti R. except we were on our way to the evening show at Gammage on Sunday 11/27/16. We have always made dining at ZTejas a tradition before or after a show because it has always been so predictably good.  We arrived about 4:20 to an almost empty restaurant and had to wait to order, to get our drinks, to get cornbread and then finally our meals at about 5:10 from a waitress who was overwhelmed. During this time that we were waiting the entire restaurant had filled up and all of the tables around us had ordered, eaten and completed their dining experience before we even received our entrees. When we questioned the waitress she stated that she would check on our meals. This was all fine....until the manager came over. She proceeded to tell us that it was our fault that the food took so long because of the combination of items we ordered. What?? Really?? An appetizer, a salad, a burger (which was cold) and tacos? Then she said that she'd buy us a dessert but she knew that we were in a hurry and probably wouldn't want it anyway. She reluctantly took the cold burger off the check with an eye roll and the removed the happy hour appetizer for the inconvenience. We didn't need to have anything complimentary but a sincere apology from this woman who had obviously understaffed would have been sufficient.   This will be our last trip to Tempe ZTejas since there are too many other good choices for us in Tempe. It's time for a new tradition!"}
{"text":"Great service, solid selection on menu for a \"TexMex\" place -delicious corn bread was complimentary. Very reasonable prices - will definitely come back for happy hour - service was phenomenal. Decent beer selection but they're known for their margaritas. Full liquor selection. Overall a really solid experience!"}
{"text":"Every time I go to Z'Tejas I just love it! I always pig out on the Trio App - warm queso, salsa, and guacamole - and taste my meal. I always take home left overs.  Tonight I got the Steak Fajitas. They were delicious and a bit different than other fajitas I've had. There was a citrus flare to these fajitas without too many onions and peppers.   This was the best part:   On Tuesday's Fajitas are only $10.99 and you get 1/2 your first margarita! What a deal. If you've had the margs at Z, you know you don't need much more than 1. 2 will do you. I highly recommend the Chambord Frozen Margarita. Delicious!   The service was quite attentive. Presentation was nice and the patio was perfect.   Quite honestly, not a thing I didn't like at Z'Tejas - Tempe. BTW, I usually frequent the Scottsdale Fashion Square location. They remodeled their entire restaurant. I love the new atmosphere although the patio is always my first choice for a table."}
{"text":"My father and I have eaten here several times and it is definitely a favorite. My father discovered it when he was staying at a hotel nearby many years ago and wound up eating there every night for a full week. The food is always delicious, the drinks are always delightful, the service has never failed to be friendly and inviting, and the restaurant is always clean.    The last meal we enjoyed consisted of a chicken avocado sandwich and the voodoo tuna. The sandwich was arranged on two butter hamburger buns that were so fresh they melted in my mouth and the chicken was moist and very tender. The jalapeno mayonnaise added just the right kick and I scarfed it and the accompanying sweet potato fries down within minutes.  Even though I liked my sandwich, the voodoo tuna was a few steps above it. Juicy lightly seared tuna steak with pickled ginger on the top that gave it so much flavor my tongue didn't know what to focus on first. Dad could barely comment on the meal between bites, it was so good.   We ordered mojitos that were prepared exactly the way a mojito should be, with lots of mint, lime and just the right amount of rum. The complimentary cornbread was freshly baked and delicious as usual. And to top off the evening, we ordered the chef dessert which was chocolate lava cake filled with a thick dark chocolate center that had a slight hint of peppermint. A scoop of pistachio icecream balanced the dish nicely and by the time we had nearly licked the plate clean, we were stuffed and quite content."}
{"text":"Z'Tejas is a great restaurant with reliable food and service. I've come here for work lunches as well as dinner with friends, and haven't had a bad experience. There are a lot of choices for vegetarians, which is great. I really like the mushroom enchiladas, mac & cheese, and chopped salad. Their complimentary cornbread is awesome too!"}
{"text":"The mac and cheese meal with chicken here is awesome. It has just a bit of a kick. I tried the chicken, artichoke, and mushroom stack last night for dinner and that's my new favorite. The chicken enchiladas are just ok. Be careful with the frozen margaritas here. They have more alcohol in them than the on the rocks version and will knock you on your ass if you're not careful.  They have fajitas for $10.99 on Tuesdays with half of margaritas with the purchase of a fajita platter.   And don't worry about finding parking here. They have free valet for paying  customers. Just make sure to get a validation stamp from the hostess before you leave."}
{"text":"As usual the food was great.  Casey made this the place I'll keep bringing out of town guests.  Friendly and funny made for a enjoyable evening."}
{"text":"The smoked chicken stuffed poblano was fantastic!!! My cousin said his skirt steak was delicious. Finally a five star southwestern restaurant."}
{"text":"The margaritas are good. I enjoyed several \"Hard Days\" during Happy Hour at $5 a piece. The $8 Street Tacos were very tasty and hit the spot. The service was a little slow and forgetful. I attribute this to the fact that the entire staff is comprised of ASU students. So be patient and you will enjoy the experience."}
{"text":"It's a freaking chain but they do have decent food and good margaritas.  Unlike every other location of this chain I've been to across the country this one has some stupid rule that they have a limit on the number of margaritas you can buy...   Seriously a limit of THREE?  Do I look like an 80 pound sorority girl tasting booze for the first time or I'm I still actually a 200+ pound old rugby player, honorably discharged army vet, seasoned party professional and citizen of New Orleans that finds downing three of these things easier than Cortes conquering the Aztecs?  I  lived next to the original location of this chain in Austin and I never had to contend with such a ridiculous policy.  No other place in Tempe seems to have such a stupid policy.  The margaritas are good but they are FAR from being high octane potent!   I can understand if someone is stupid drunk being cut off but just having a blanket policy that they are going to limit the number of drinks you can buy is just plain anti-capitalist and un-American!  All I can figure is they are attempting to discourage this from becoming a college hangout...  Ah well at least there are many better LOCAL joints at a better value that don't ration out their drinks in the area."}
{"text":"Great value, delicious food, nice casual atmosphere.  But best of all, terrific service. Our server was busy and someone else noticed and got us started with our order.  Excellent team work and very well-managed.  Keep up the great job!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place but  this time I was very disappointed. The grilled vegetable platter  was just O.K. and way overpriced. The complimentary cornbread that is a big hit was not baked although it was 4:30 in the afternoon. I was hoping to eat it with the veggie platter. . The waiter offered to put it in a box when it was ready for us to take with us which was thoughtful but we were going to a play and couldn't have taken it even if we wanted to. Worst part of all is the cornbread tasted \"flat\". and came with some spread which was not butter. I asked for butter and got a huge dish of margarine. Ended up leaving half the cornbread and ALL the margarine My husband had a tasteless tortilla soup. The margherita was good as was the guacamole. A bowl of soup, veggie platter, margherita and guacamole cost $32."}
{"text":"We went here tonite to enjoy some nice Mexican food but were really disappointed. We understand it's 5 de mayo but the service sucked! You were understaffed drinks took 20 minutes! Then the food came out in sections! The longest one was an appetizer that came out after the meals! The food was cold and the server was nice enough to replace it. Server was on point with his water and was really nice I'd give him a 5 star! Wasn't his fault the food sucked! Save your money and go somewhere else food is overpriced for small bland portions!"}
{"text":"I ordered the street tacos and they were definitely not worth the price and they were kind of bland and the rice and beans on the side were very sub par"}
{"text":"I have eaten here numerous times through the years and the food is always really good. This is a solid choice for lunch, dinner and happy hour. But lets be honest people, there is one thing that constantly brings me back to Z tejas, the Chambord Margarita. From the first time that I tried one back in 2001 up to today, this is the best margarita I have ever had. Everytime I come to Mill Ave. this is the first place that I go. I have one Chambord and then hit the town. You gotta get one!"}
{"text":"We went for Mother's Day 5/10/15 and we had to wait for one hour to order even though we had reservations. While we waited we had to refill our own drinks by getting up to see the bartender and get water from the mimosa bar. When we were finally served an hour later my meal was not not appetizing. I ordered the Parmesan, pecan encrusted chicken salad and the chicken was on the cold side, but I could tell it was supposed to be hot. My mother's sausage was under cooked and I'm worried because my 2 year old son ate some raw sausage. Two meals got switched and the person who doesn't eat tomatoes had to pick them out of the eggs. The part that made it really unfortunate was that our meals came at different times. At first people waited to eat and then after a half hour of waiting people started on their meals. After most people were done my sister-in-law was finally served. In the end the manager came to the table and took off some meals and the drinks and gave some gift certificates for us to give them another chance. But, the experience was marred and to add insult to injury they never brought the mothers their special free desert.   All in all a very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Great place if you're living close on mill. I go all the time and the margs are amazing. The tostadas bites are delicious as well. The cornbread they bring out is always hot. Service is always great too. I don't have much to complain about but it's always a great place to check out and hang out with friends"}
{"text":"I just can't eat at this one since getting terrible service and then going into the restroom only to find it completely devoid of soap.  Yes, you know what that means boys & girls, none of the female staff had soap to wash their hands either.  GROSS!  This was a year or two ago and fingers crossed they're better now but this Z-Tejas location is ruined for me."}
{"text":"We checked online what time they were closed, it said 10:00pm we went at 9:15 as we are quick diners and knew we would be done quickly. We showed up at 9:15, clearly before they closed and were refused dining. We will never go back and try this restaurant because of how rude they were to us. NEVER go there because they are extremely rude and only care about getting out early and not staying open until the posted time!!!!"}
{"text":"I have visited this location many times before but my negative experience last night NEEDS to be reviewed. My 3 friends and I were craving a tasty marg so we decided to start our cinco de mayo at z. After the hosts quoting 20 mins for inside or right away outside, we decided on the patio as we saw open tables on our way in. They had us wait 10 mins to be sat, not the biggest deal.   A very nice server, Andi I believe, greeted us and started us off by putting in a round a drinks and a few apps because our server was in the weeds. We waited for waters for ~10 minutes(on a warm 105 May day) and then another 10 minutes for our \"frozen\" margs...I quote frozen because they were half liquid and must have sat in the drink well for half the time we waited. This is when we had the pleasure of meeting our extremely rude(quick to leave, short, unpleasant, unfriendly) server.  We decided to put in another round of drinks right then, knowing it would likely be another 20 mins before we got them, as well as 3 more apps. It took about that long and soon we were eating 2 of our apps and next round of drinks. About this time the hosts were putting together a large table and soon this big party arrived. As they kept adding tables to the big party, they were soon on top of us and we were forced to lift our table ourselves and move it a few feet over. Not really cool with a table full of drinks and food.   We had been at our table about an hour now and we were still waiting on our third app. At this point we were ready to go and our server said he would be right out with the last app. He came back with it and my girlfriend politely asked \"may I speak with your manager please\" to address our issues. Instead of pre-bussing our empty plates, glasses, or refilling our waters, and grabbing the manager; our server decided to ask my girlfriend \"may I ask why you want to speak with my manager\" and then proceeded to argue with us about all the ways he had failed us throughout our dining experience.   Next came out the bar manager who confirmed our server as confrontational and apologized on his behalf and took $14 off of our $118 bill...I would have done more to recover the bad experience but everyone's different.  I end this novel by explaining my one star review. I give one star for the young lady who first greeted us with a smile and got our drink order. I give no stars to our horrible server and his piss service. No water refills, no prebus, no apology for things taking too long, and his poor attitude. I give zero stars for the management not preparing for cinco de mayo at a Mexican (southwestern grill) restaurant and allowing the night to be understaffed, underprepared, and not touching our table before we had to ask for management.   This experience left a bad taste for everyone in my group and I will most definitely not return. I recommend for anyone reading to not waste their time and money at this ztejas. There are plenty of other much better options. I hate to be so negative but if nothing is said, nothing will change."}
{"text":"Nothing special here. Food isn't bad but nothing to get excited about. Especially for the price. Service is just ok. Went there with some friends and probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Walked in during the Tempa Arts Festival. The restaurant was crowded so went to the bar to sit down and eat, the bartender was very helpful. I noticed a flight of margaritas to try and told the bartender to pick, she did and great job and they really packed a wallop(they don't short change you on the amount of tequila). She brought over a pan of corn bread that was absolutely delicious with juices pieces of corn mixed in. We shared a the Chicken Enchilada and the steak tacos, both were flavorful and delicious and nicely proportioned. Love to go back and try more food. What a great find and the prices were very reasonable. The decor was warm and friendly and the staff was very helpful also."}
{"text":"My friend kept hyping up this place, telling me that there was a potent drink called a little stick that tasted like a big stick.  The closest thing they had to that was their margarita and it tasted nothing like a big stick =(  The chile relleno I had was close to inedible.  I just don't know what they were doing when they stuffed it full of dry overcooked chicken, apricots, raisins and whatnot.  There was barely any cheese in there, I was hoping for a cheesy chicken gooey delicious explosion in my mouth.  It clearly did not happen =(  My companions got the diablo pasta and that was good but it was really just fetticine in cream sauce.  Definitely a waste of a foodie trip =("}
{"text":"zTejas is a good compromise for people who like quasi-authentic southwestern fare and those who don't.  Someone who doesn't want any southwestern flavor at all could go with the hamburger, chicken sandwich (hold the jalapeno mayo), or caesar salad.  I usually  have the vegetable quesadillas, chile relleno, or achiote chicken salad. Just steer clear of the Red Chile and Mango Steak Salad.   I rarely eat beef but I know what it's supposed to taste like, and this stuff was dried out and tough and gross.  I love that they offer Little Larry margaritas (smaller, cheaper, and less intoxicating than the regular size).  The food and service have been pretty consistent here and it's kinda nice not to have to deal with Fashion Square."}
{"text":"Service was good and provided wonderful recommendations. My wife and I were able to take all the time we needed to place our order then to eat. I didn't feel rushed out the door which made it a pleasant experience where we could relax have some good food and some drinks."}
{"text":"Second time here during spring training. Fantastic. I had chorizo stuffed pork loins that were great. Mule margarita was different and great. Wife had parm ckn spinach salad and I tried that too -- another winner."}
{"text":"Great place to enjoy some tasty cocktails!  NIce atmosphere, friendly staff, great cocktails and good food too!"}
{"text":"Great southwestern food! Happy hour = half price chips/salsa/queso/guac!  The seafood enchilladas were good.... Cornbread was amazing! Super service on the patio!"}
{"text":"Great food, great attitude, & great service!  Casey & Amber you both rock!  Thanks for making our Anniversary special.   We plan on coming back for our 10th next year.  The margaritas, catfish beignets, smoked chicken quesadilla, tejas trio, & ancho chile pie were just as good as every visit.  Hopefully, we'll be back soon."}
{"text":"I did not have very high expectations from this place when I stopped by on a weeknight, but woohoo, it's good! Quite good. I got the fajitas (they are deliciously Whole30 compliant...to my knowledge!) and the restaurant was willing to give me extra guac to make it compliant. Service was attentive, kind, and fast. I'll definitely stop by here again!"}
{"text":"Came for happy hour with my girlfriends and was kinda disappointed. We came for the margaritas, however the glasses were only barely 3/4 full and there was no salt on the rim. I know it's happy hour but there was barely any alcohol in the drinks. I don't think we will return here for happy hour. The chips and salsa were great tho!"}
{"text":"Went for Happy Hour, it was a pretty decent deal. Tostada appetizer was delish. The chambord margarita was also a a treasure."}
{"text":"I would come back to this place just for the cornbread.  I had a mac and cheese type dish that was pretty good.  The service was good.  I came during lunch and they served us pretty quickly."}
{"text":"One of the only true sit down Mexican restaurants close to campus. The cornbread that they give you the beginning his very excellent. And the enchiladas are also good themselves. A good place to take someone on a date!"}
{"text":"not worth the money drinks are very small with a high cost, since when do serve margarita's in a rock glass bartending 101"}
{"text":"It was time to say our goodbyes.  My daughter just took a job in Seattle to be a C-Level Executive for an international company based out of Seattle. She would be leaving the following morning, and already held her going away party with her friends and sisters.  It was now time to say goodbye to Dad and Mom. She wanted to stay close to her condo as she was busy packing, and had movers arriving in a few hours.  We're a Sun Devils family.   We've eaten here at Z Tejas over the years after many sporting events, and other activities at ASU. We've seen this place evolve and devolve, and have had mixed reactions as time passed.  We decided to avoid this place for several years when we heard that they were going through some rough times, and got to experience it in the form of downgraded food quality and lackadaisical service.  Such was not the case this Sunday morning, during our brunch engagement.  Perhaps, it was the fact that we were the only other customer in the house, or that they were just simply trying to do their best to elevate our experience level. I say this due to the fact that this definitely was not the typical Z Tejas experience.  Our server was attentive, prompt and courteous, and the food was quite delectable and appetizing.  For starters we had the bran muffin with fresh fruit. Then our server introduced us to the fact that for every order of a pan of corn bread, the restaurant would donate the proceeds to a worthy charity. That was our cue - sign us up!  For the main courses, we had the Chorizo Skillet, Chicken and Hash, and the Chicken Fried Chicken. These were definitely not the typical Z Tejas fare that we were familiar with and had grown disinterested with over the years.   These were definitely quite a step above, and quite flavorful. The portions were smallish, but enough to satisfy our appetites. We even opted to order the Guac, Salsa and Cheese Dip combo as an aside to add dimension to our meals.  And we were not the least bit disappointed!  Management has definitely done a remarkable job turning this franchise around, and elevating one's dining experience expectations.   Very well done!"}
{"text":"Chicken tortilla soup is delicious!!! Highly recommended! Everyone that ordered it all agreed that it was perfect. Chambord margarita is delicious as well!! Everyone also agreed that these margaritas were pretty bomb.  I came here previously and just recently for lunch. The whole group I was with enjoyed our lunch especially the margaritas. Two friends had the chicken avocado sandwich with sweet potato fries. I had the soup and a garden salad. Sandwiches are probably the better option but if I didn't say it enough try the tortilla soup!   I will be back, maybe to try out the happy hour!"}
{"text":"First timer here... initially the service was lacking due to a snafu in the back. However they came around and the end result was impressive! Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Not bad at all.  Nothing really to rave about.  They do have a great happy hour!  It was late and we were hungry and this was the first restaurant we saw right across from the public parking off Mill Ave.  I had the Chicken Tortilla soup and House Salad.  The soup tasted like it's from a mix that they added fresh ingredients to and the salad was pretty decent.  My husband had the Chicken Enchilada.  He said that it was not bad.  My little one wanted the Grilled Cheese Sandwich off the KID'S MENU with fries.  I had to ask what kind of cheese they use since he does not like American cheese.  They use Jack Cheese that doesn't have much taste.  Why do most restaurants make kid's meals so bland?  As if they don't have any taste buds!!!  Oh, well, he liked the fries and the complimentary corn bread.    We've always had great service here, though.  I'd rather come back for their Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"The cornbread was good. The margarita was good. And there are your two stars. The service was pretty abysmal, and so was the rest of my food. I Ordered the chicken quesadilla, and alerted them to the fact that I have food allergies. My quesadilla came out with nothing other than chicken and cheese. It was so bland the only thing I could taste was the corn tortilla. They didn't bring me the side of rice or beans that was supposed to accompany my meal, so I can only assume that they had onions in them. They did not offer me anything else to replace them and they did not say anything or apologize. They just brought me the terrible quesadilla."}
{"text":"I sat for 20 minuets and never got waited on unbelievable for this place they were not busy I even sat next to the waiter station pitiful at best. So I gave it a shot and went back in and they did a great service to the brand the bartender dalton was great I expressed my Prius experience he made my dinning experience great I will change my rating anyone can drop the ball I expected more and they delivered for sure."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner late one evening.  The food was tasty and very attractively presented.  The service was friendly and the atmosphere is excellent.  I had the Baja fish tacos, which were fine although probably not as good as you might find in San Diego.  My friend had the Parmesan Pecan-Crusted Chicken Salad, which was a winner.  I would go back."}
{"text":"Pretty hit or miss.  Cornbread was great, the place was really empty when we went, but/so the service was great, nice and conversational.  We got the salsa trio and the red salsas were great.  Other than that, the chicken tortilla soup, crab spinach dip, catfish tacos, and the stuffed poblano pepper were really all rather unremarkable and I can't say I recommend a visit."}
{"text":"Love the complimentary corn break. I had pork tenderloin, which was good. The mashed potatoes weren't impressive though. BF had the ahi, it was pretty yummy. Came with rice pilaf which weren't very flavorful.   My mango mojito tasted like fruit juice. BF liked the margaritas, though."}
{"text":"I love their cornbread for only $3. Their lunch menu is awesome. I got an enchilada and soup for $12!"}
{"text":"Z'Tejas made me realize that I should eat brunch more often.  It's not quite breakfast, it's not quite lunch, but it comes with a slice of cantaloupe at the end.  You don't get completely what you would at breakfast, but you get a good meal!  Come on, Z'Tejas, there are ten pins in my heart, you've knocked over eight.  Won't you please pick up that spare?  I ordered their breakfast-y enchilada and it was pretty amazing.  It had an egg on top and spicy sauce and it was served with a muffin and fruit.  Enchiladas, eggs, muffins, fruits.  And iced tea.  The combination of flavors was kind of a shock going from here to there but it was fantastic and I loved it.  I've ridden past this place again and again and again.  People have spoken about it on Yelp.  People have told me how awesome it was.  Seeing it out of the corner of my eye going down mill, I never made the connection that it was there.  Because of the red, squiggly \"Z\" in front, I always assumed it was a cell phone company.  I don't know.  It just looked that way to me.  I'm glad I finally checked it out.  On a lazy, hungover Sunday, I'll be back."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of Tex-Mex in general but my mom had a gift card so we decided to give it a try. The service was nice and the waitress was very attentive. (this is noteworthy because my family is the kind of family where every single member has some special order with their meal)   The restaurant was full of... well I can't even describe the kind of people I found here. Imagine if a rich snob from Scottsdale had a bunch of kids with a pretentious asshole college student from Tempe. Then imagine if their kids grew up and lived in one restaurant. Luckily the seating was kind of private and we went during a time when it wasn't busy.  I don't like corn bread but my family said the cornbread was fantastic. It looked pretty legit to me. The food itself was pretty good. Kind of pricey. Oh man but their margaritas sucked. I think they used store brand tequila or something."}
{"text":"Salad was great, food was bland. Table side margarita was served in a pint glass? Focus on service was very impressive. A sign of great management. Wish the enchilada special would have been all that. Next time?"}
{"text":"Now that I have moved to CA, I never get to eat at Z'Tejas anymore.  So I of course had to pay them a visit when I was in town.  I ordered what I always ordered...the Chicken Jerk Salad.  I don't care for the sesame dressing that comes with it, so I ask for Caesar instead. It was pretty good.  Two of my friends decided to try the bloody Mary bar.  It was pretty cool.  You make it yourself near the bar.  You can add beef sticks, pickles, pepperoni and more.  Not a bad deal for $4."}
{"text":"Nothing wrong with this place. Good food (not great but darn tasty) and service is always good (not great except on occasion.)  My kids and I like to eat here in the afternoons (close to their school) because the appetizers are half-price during happy hour.  We ate for $13.51 before tip yesterday;  an adult and a 12-yr-old girl and a 14-yr-old boy.  And we all got full.  We each had an appetizer and drank water (not paying for the sodas helps keep the tab down.)  One thing I REALLY liked yesterday:  the \"Salsa of the Day\" was VERY, VERY good.  Had a great spicy kick, a good taste, and I ate three tubs of it myself.  Never before had they given me one this good, and I'd say we've eaten there somewhere between 8-12 times."}
{"text":"Wow great find for my wife, son and myself while in town for a big 21st b-day party. The atmosphere is very upscale and the staff super friendly. The food really shines here - I like to cook Mexican food so I am very critical of how dishes are prepared. Every dish we ordered was wonderful - lot's interesting ingredients on every dish that played well on the palette. The corn bread they bring to the table is fantastic - best I ever have had."}
{"text":"Z-Tejas serves up your basic \"Tex-Mex\" cuisine with New Mexican, Arizonan, and Mexican influence.  I would have given only 2 stars because my dish (carne enchiladas) was just plain.  However, my wife enjoyed her chile relleno and we had an excellent server, so I bumped it up to 3 stars (the homemade cornbread is also delicious).    Trufthfully, there are many better options in Tempe and Scottsdale so don't waste your time here.  It's kind of like eating at an upscale of version of Chili's (which is right around the corner), which means that you could go to Chili's and get the same food for much cheaper."}
{"text":"I just exorcised some demons in my nastiest review ever, and then felt very yucky and negative. So I decided I needed to write a nice review to balance things out, and started thinking about some of my favorite things.  Z'Tejas and Z's happy hour is one of those favorite things. I look forward to unwinding on the patio after a long day/week. It's pretty fab - all appetizers are half off. Half off!!! Which means you get those orgasmic Shrimp Tostada Bites, the fun Tejas Trio, quesadillas, and a whole bunch of other stuff for around 5 bucks a pop. Nice!  Drinks aren't that deeply discounted (a dollar off drafts & margaritas, I think) which is a bit of a bummer. But I would rather have a really well-done drink/quality draft and pay a bit more than have worthless, average drinks for half price.  Happy hour is always reliable in my experience. The regular menu is good as well (I do like their burgers and the chile relleno is PHENOMENAL) and the cornbread you get with happy hour or regular service is so beautiful when slathered with their whipped honey butter, I want to marry it.  Consistent service, good selection, quality food, a touch of the southwest, unique to the West (those who call it a chain invoke thoughts of Applebee's and TGIF and Z is absolutely no freaking chain)...  ...Overall, I heart Z."}
{"text":"Well hot damn.  Food - very good.  Well, at least the stuff I got.  Catfish Tacos were great as I chowed down on them.  However, it seemed to be half-and-half as our table was split as to their meal choice.  Ohhh and while I'm on the topic, try the Steak Buritto.  Service - A-OK.  They were always checkign up on us.  Didn't go above or beyond but were very solid (even though they stuck us in the corner).  Overall - I mean, it's a solid place for a good meal.  You're not going to get AMAZING anything, but it is a good place to head after HH."}
{"text":"Was very impressed by this place. Yes, I've lived in Texas and like \"that kind of food,\" but it was quite tasty. Had a burger and their guacamole, and both were very good. Good service. I'll be back."}
{"text":"The margs are worth coming for. For a place with such a light clientele on a Sat night, you would expect spectacular service.   My observation is that everyone working here has been here a long time, and they could care les if you are having a good experience.   So, matter of fact and cold delivery insures this will be my last visit here, good margs or not."}
{"text":"Came here with my boss on a site view and was impressed with the extensive menu. The chips and salsa was interesting. The salsa wasn't a typical salsa and so I didn't care too much for it. This left me kind of concerned for the actual meal. However, my meal was great! My boss got the chicken fried ribeye and I got the Barbacoa enchiladas. The enchiladas were amazing!! I don't think I've ever made a happy plate to that extent before. I can't wait to go back to the Tempe area to try other things on their menu!"}
{"text":"I dined at Z'tejas a few nights ago and was really disappointed. I normally go to the location on Ray but I was in Tempe so we decided to just go to the one on mill. Our experience showed me that sharing the name Z'tejas doesn't mean you're going to get the same experience.   First of all, I saw an employee not wash their hands.. ew. When we ordered queso it came out watery. When we dipped our chip in it was an extremely thin liquid and dripped off the chip. We asked for a new one (because I've had the queso 100 times at the other location and love it). The manager came out and said \"I heard about the queso, just so you know when cheese is really hot it thins and that's what it was but it's fine we can give you a new one but it will do the same thing\". It came off pretty rude, like we were just complaining to complain. I wanted to tell him that I've had the appetizer 100 times but figured it wasn't worth it. The only reason I'm giving them two stars instead of one is because our waitress was sweet and attentive. I definitely will pick a different restaurant on Mill next time I'm out there. Also I wish I had gotten the managers name because he was pretty rude, it was Friday April 7th around 7pm if that's any help to the GM."}
{"text":"My family was looking for some good Mexican food in Tempe and I referred to Yelp.  We decided to to try Z Tejas. We were not disappointed.  The food was fantastic and the service was just as good.  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I went here for Mother's Day lunch. We were able to call ahead and put our name down so we wouldn't have to wait when we got there. The service was really good and the staff was all really nice and helpful. However after getting seated and ordering our drinks it took them 10-15 minutes to bring the drinks. I thought that was weird and a little long. However our food was amazing. It still took a while for our food to come out as well. The place wasn't that busy at all which is why it was peculiar why they were taking so long for everything and they seemed to have more than enough staff. We ordered the meat lover skillet, which was simply amazing. So tasty and good. The bananas foster french toast was really good as well. I'm not much of a sweet tooth so I wouldn't order it. It was super sweet. The mushroom enchiladas were really good. We asked for them very spicy and they definitely made it spicy. They added some diablo sauce. So if you like spicy I would recommend any of the enchilada dishes with diablo sauce. We were also recommended by the waiter to order the street tacos. They were not good tacos at all the o be honest. They were not tasty and were dry and bland."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times but usually for drinks.  The atmosphere is fine.  Just went there for apps and drinks and it was terrible.  All of the food was cold.  The crab taco special was marginal, very little crab.  The mango salsa it came with was good but they provided so little you just didn't have enough to do anything with.  The mini shrimp avocado tostadas were good but cold.  The soft tortilla fish tacos are usually pretty good but again cold.  The app with chips and three dips was decent.  The serving size are limited on the salsa and guacamole.  The margaritas are average at best.  Even with premium tequila they are just not made very well.  Look at my review of Barrio Cafe.  Our server was terrible.  She was hard to get or find, didn't pay attention to what we said most times, and waited forever to bring our food.  The apps took about 40 minutes and the place was not busy so go figure.  Having a drink or two here is fine as long as you stick with wine or beer but the service and food just aren't up to snuff."}
{"text":"With all the hype hearing it from my friends, visited this place for a birthday and food was very greasy and did not like it. Ordered: mushroom and spinach quesadilla."}
{"text":"Referred by a friend, tried this place a couple of days ago, and LOVED the Baja Fish Tacos. Came back and ordered them again. Fish cooked perfectly; I chose the flour tortillas instead of the usual corn ones."}
{"text":"Had appetizer $8 Pork Tostadas' Delicious! not much one can say about mexican fare, same 6 ingredients just arranged differently and called something else. We ate at happy hour and bloody mary's were $8.75. Went there to kill time while our flight was delayed.  Great service. Was lucky to find parking. On the sunny side of the street at 108 degrees one might argue that isn't lucky."}
{"text":"Visited a friend recently in Tempe and he took me to this place. The service was great, the staff was super friendly and attentive, definitely a lot more polite than I am used to from New York so they get an A on that. Other than that there is nothing special about this place.  The atmosphere is cool. The food was also good, but nothing that really blew my mind. Over all a good experience but probably wouldn't find me going back here even if I lived in the area."}
{"text":"Service was outstanding.  Food is verrrry mediocore.   I like how they bring cornbread in a skillet with butter.  If you like Tex-Mex you'll love this place.  I really don't care for it.  But give it a try. Location is fantastic. Near many shops and other restaurants."}
{"text":"Great happy hour. $5 margaritas and 7 dollar table side guac. Yum! Customer service is always good and every time I'm in Tempe, I stop by for drinks and food."}
{"text":"You can find me at this place very regularly. I consider myself a true regular of Z'Tejas.   Since my first week at Tempe, I've been to Z'Tejas probably nearly 50 times.   The service is always amazing! I love the service, sonis the atmosphere, especially when the weather is suitable for the patio area, that is the best area to sot at.   This is one of my favorite places at Mill Ave. and I will always love it.   The Tejas trio is how I begin each time I go there, the guacamole, salsa and the queso is all very amazing, the tortilla chips are bottomless.   My favorite two dishes are the diablo pasta with chicken (spicy) and their chicken fajita. Both are awesome! I don't prefere some other dishes, I didn't like the tacos and the enchillada. However their hige salads are very filling and nice too.   My number 1 place in Arizona!"}
{"text":"I've probably been to Z Tejas more times than any other restaurant in the area. For a franchise, it is surprisingly good and consistent. I can think of only one bad meal I had here (a chile relleno) and many more good to great meals. All the appetizers are good, including my favorite thing on the menu, blackened catfish tacos. Also good are the barbacoa stackers, and from the main menu all the salads are good and interesting, as well as the mushroom enchiladas (outstanding) and the macaroni and cheese (just good soul food). Another specialty are their margaritas. I generally prefer the 6th street on the rocks, but the frozen margaritas have more alcohol in them (for the same price--a bit annoying) so I've started ordering those. Their mojitos are also really good. The service is usually pretty good, even when in big parties (I've been with ~20 people at happy hour and the service is fairly quick and friendly; they will also split bills for easier payment). The best time to come is during happy hour, when margaritas are a dollar off and all the appetizers are half price (1 appetizer is usually enough for me). It can get crowded at times, so if you have a larger party I would recommend a reservation, especially if you want to sit inside.   Also as an aside, they have a gluten-free menu upon request (my friend loves one of the salads on that and asks for it even though she can eat gluten)."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming to this and other Z-Tejas locations for their great food, good margaritas and the awesome fun bar on the weekends. The reason for this review is the great customer service I received during a recent visit to the Mill Ave location. Our party encountered a small issue with the outside chairs having some moisture on them thus resulting in a small stain on one of the clothing items. The manager, Joel was very professional about this mishap, explained what had caused it and went above and beyond to take care of the awkward situation in a very professional manner. Mistakes happen but what matters is how this restaurant's staff handled the situation."}
{"text":"Stopped by at the bar to watch the NBA finals game 5- great food and drinks with a fun environment."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants.  Highly recommend their frozen margaritas on happy hour and the tejas trio!"}
{"text":"I don't know that I've ever ate here before, But I do know that I've drank here a lot of times and theyhave the BEST shamborak Margaritas ever! I stop here ever time I'm in the area just for the margs!"}
{"text":"Food isn't too bad. Service is miserably slow for a slow Sunday even with the ironman event in town. Not really worth the $$$. No beer selection either."}
{"text":"Great place to eat, great atmosphere, awesome happy hour but the food  is lacking authenticity which is why it only gets 3 stars from me."}
{"text":"Good drink and could not eat much of the food. I have a gluten allergy and really nothing i could do. They do have a Nice happy hour. This is also a good place to people watch. Right downtown. I think on the weekend this place will be hopping. Just watch out if you have Celiec"}
{"text":"Only had appetizers and corn bread. Bread is made all day. Tried the tuna, wings, chips and salsa, queso and dumplings. The experience was pleasant and smooth.  The decor is very western and rustic. It's a nice atmosphere and good to take friends or business colleagues out for a good time."}
{"text":"My husband and I didn't want to venture far on Friday evening for happy  hour, so we decided to check out Z Tejas' specials. We sat at the bar and were helped by two very nice bartenders. During happy hour, drinks are $1 off and appetizers are half price.  Again the Tejas trio and cornbread did not disappoint. If we had stopped there, this would probably have garnered four stars from me as a happy hour destination. However, we also tried the smoked chicken jumbo quesadilla which was very disappointing. While the green peppers were a nice touch, the chicken was much too smokey and there was practically no cheese in the quesadilla. There was just something that was totally off about this dish. On our way back home, we decided that on future Z Tejas happy hour outings, we are completely sticking to drinks and the Tejas trio.  For six beers, 1 margarita, and 2 appetizers, our bill was $34 so we were pleasantly happy. Happy hour only runs until 6:30 and I noticed that at 5:45 or so, the bar area was completely full, so make sure to get there early to get a seat."}
{"text":"I went there for the first time last night. I made a reservation online which was nice because you didn't have to try to call in or wait when you got there. The food is good and the service was great. They give you bread at your table which is a little different then chips from what I am use to at southwestern food but it was good. I tried the dumpling appetizer it was good!!"}
{"text":"I went to Z'Tejas on a recent business trip to Phoenix.  We were looking for something a little nicer off University and Z'Tejas fit the bill perfectly.  My friend and I arrived and opted to sit at the bar.    Drinks / Appetizers:  The bartender was prompt and we were lucky enough to arrive at 6:59 and the happy hour closed at 7.  We ordered 2x of their special margaritas (the strong ones), the shrimp mini-tostadas and the tuna appetizer.  The drinks arrived promptly accompanied by the homemade cornbread (amazing) and were a fantastic mix of flavor and alcohol.  Normally with frozen margaritas they go too strong or not strong enough, these were perfect.  The sesame tuna sashimi was good as I would expect it to be, however the shrimp mini-tostadas were the star of the appetizers.  The pesto was fantastic and they went quickly.    Main Course:  We both ordered steak fajitas and they came out sizzling as they should.  I prefer a little harder char on the steak, but you couldn't deny the flavor.  They were good enough to feel confident about ordering them on a regular basis, however don't expect them to change redefine what you want in a fajita.  They were what you'd expect from a nice restaurant.      Desert:  We each started with a 3rd margarita each (which we later were told was the limit because it equates to a 1/2 bottle of alcohol) and ordered peach cobblers.  Be warned, these warm cobblers are ENORMOUS and unless you have an empty leg, or severe case of self loathing, I'd order it to share.    Overall thoughts / impression:  The restaurant was exactly what we were looking for when we walked in off University.  It was a nicer mid-tier restaurant experience in what is typically a collegey area of town (ASU is right down the street).  The Happy Hour is noteworthy in that drinks / appetizers were 1/2 off and if I make it back to Phoenix for work or fun I'd definitely attend again for that reason alone."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner a few nights ago -  The margaritas are the only factor that brought this review up to 3 stars.  Compared to a place down the street these margaritas were outstanding.  The food was nothing extraordinary.  The guacamole was WAY overpriced for what you get.  Yea, it's cool that they make it tableside but the portion is very small for $10.50 and it wasn't that flavorful.  Also, it took a significant amount of time for it to come to our table.  So much time, that our entrees were served within minutes, which is one thing I hate.  Who wants their dinner experience to be rushed?  I ordered the baked seafood enchiliadas, which sounded amazing on the menu.  Very disappointing.  It definitely wasn't an enchilada...just two small tortillas stacked on top of each other with mostly a spinach filling. Not much seafood at all and they completely forgot to include any shrimp on.  When I asked for the shrimp, the waiter brought out 2 small very overcooked shrimp.  I substituted the beans for vegetables which were very bland and wilted (green beans and corn).   My boyfriend ordered the barbacoaa enchiliadas...again nothing special.  Sounded better on paper.   I would maybe only go back for the happy hour margaritas.  Disappointed."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday with a group to celebrate a going away thing...  Our server was good...she got all our orders down...food came out fast...it was yummy...all went really well...  except toward the end...after the bill was paid...some of our group left and like 5 of us were still talking...  the tab books were already picked up so thats possibly why this happened...  The manager comes up to us and asks if we mind getting up cause he's waiting to sit a table of 13 that's been waiting a while....now don't get me wrong...I would NEVER linger around if it were packed...or if there was a wait....or if it was a significant amount of time later...  But I swear we had just paid our tab maybe 15 min prior...and there were hardly any other people at the restaurant...no table around us was sat...so I am confused.  He did apologize for asking us and he said he \"waited\" as long as he could before asking us...and hey that's fine...had it made sense.    I thought maybe he said a table for 30 since that would have made some more sense...but nope it was about 10 people so I'm not sure why they needed OUR table and not...you know...the one right next to us...or the one next to that one...  very weird.  besides that it was a great time. so maybe i'll go back but I guess I'll bring a timer so that I don't overstay my welcome. lol."}
{"text":"Best margaritas and cornbread! The diablo pasta is amazing, and you get enough for two meals. I usually do not eat leftovers, but Diablo pasta (and Alfredo in the Dark from Oreganos) is the only food I still like the second day. The cornbread, street tacos and trio salsa are fantastic. The Sixth Street frozen margarita is soo yummy and strong! Great place to start a fun evening in Scottsdale or Tempe."}
{"text":"I don't think I would really classify Z tejas as a four star restaurant, but I love the place for my wednesday afternoon lunches.  I have the day off from work so I like to come here, have some margaritas and usually the chicken mac, and read on the patio.  I'm one of the only crazy people in Arizona that still sits out on the patio in the 116 degree weather.  The staff is always very attentive and are very kind in turning on the misters just for me.  The margaritas are amazing, and the food that I've tried is also incredibly delicious.    3.5 for the food 4 for the margaritas and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I'm giving it a three because the second waiter was better than the first. Second time trying this restaurant.  Maybe because I'm pregnant but I'm not a fan of the food. I had the street tacos as an appetizer and the diablo pasta as the main dish. I split the tacos with my friends husband. They lacked flavor and the meat was cold. The diablo pasta with jerk chicken tasted horrible, made me nauseated, so I returned it. I put a little salt on the dish and it didn't help. Needless to say, I won't return."}
{"text":"The food was average and the service was terrible. The app came after the entrée, really??? Was at a difference location on Wednesday and had a great time, never coming back to this location again.                   Not to mention, it was my birthday and jokingly I asked what's a good bday shot and he looked at me like I was an idiot! I went to the bathroom and my friends asked if I could get something for my birthday he replied \"Are you looking for a freebie?\" Well he obviously did not check my ID clearly since it was my birthday.  Well thanks Jay that was a great birthday experience!!  Mate you're not much!"}
{"text":"I ordered a salad with a variety of melons and grilled shrimp.  The shrimp was chewy, hard and terrible.  The rest of the salad was great but that was a huge turn off.  They did, however, have the best skinny margarita I've ever had."}
{"text":"A bit of a walk from the Mill Ave. Metro stop, but completely worth it!  One thing for sure...these guys really know how to cook a steak!  Tender, juicy, and the mushroom sauce was seasoned well with just the right thickness.  The cornbread was also delicious, served in a small cast iron skillet (the best way to make it!), cut into serving-size pieces.  And the bits of corn were visible...I love the combination of whole corn with cornmeal.  The queso dip appetizer was tasty, and be slightly careful of the red sauce drizzled on top, as it packs a bit of heat to it, but it went really well with the chips and steak.  If the weather is nice enough, I suggest outdoor seating as it is great for people-watching, almost a must in a college town.  If I ever return to this area of Arizona, I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It might be a chain restaurant but oh so good.   This is a place you have to check out.  I'm sorry I don't live in Tempe so I can't eat here more often."}
{"text":"The seafood enchiladas were great.  The complimentary cornbread is good as well.  The black beans on the side are actually beans and not a larded up mash of beans, they were very tasty.   Service was attentive and a good drink selection."}
{"text":"This place is money!  Can't go wrong with the food and they actually have some of the best Margs on Mill. Good service and good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Overall I had a great experience here. The food was delicious and the prices are very reasonable. We had a mix up with one of the appetizers but the waitress was very nice and accommodating.  The service: I am a little upset I forgot our waitresses name ( I lost the receipt with her name on it). She was very nice and helpful. Super friendly. You could tell that they were under staffed and not expecting the crowd that they had. We ordered some appetizers and myself and one other lady in my party got the same thing. When the food came out she only put in one of the orders. She thought we were sharing not that we ordered 2 of the same thing. The lady who's order did not come out was a little rude to her but the waitress handled it in stride and was very accommodating and offered multiple solutions to help rectify the problem.  The food: I ordered the crab cakes as an appetizer, and the peppered rib eye dinner special. The special came with a 10oz steak, mashed potatoes, and seasonal veggies (I asked for all broccoli). Th steak was cooked exactly how i ordered it (medium) and very tasty. They serve a hot cornbread as your \"bread\". It was DEVINE. I wanted some to go but didn't want to be obese.  If I was ever in an area that had this restaurant, I would absolutely go again. I only gave the 4 stars because of the mixup with the appetizers but other than that this is a solid place to go eat."}
{"text":"I can't really comment too much on food at Z'Tejas since I didn't eat here but I can comment on their service, decor, and margaritas. Now one thing I'll have to say to Z'Tejas is \"Job well done on your margaritas\" You take your special drink serious and the taste shows. Your service as fast and friendly. Your decor as very Phx and Southwest proud. Next time I'll try your food but let me just add your prices for your food are too high and that was a turn off and we choose not to eat there. Otherwise...your team is going a great job."}
{"text":"The place , Beautiful, The staff kind and accommodating.  The corn bread great  The Cocktails taste great The chicken fried chicken savory and good........ The chicken fried steak,take it off the menu or improve . Even the staff hesitate to offer it. Its like the chef is stubborn and doesn't want to listen, I've been on a quest to find the best chicken fried steak . can anyone lead me to the a perfect chicken fried steak.    I love the restaurant   But not the CHICKEN FRIED STEAK"}
{"text":"Freaking awesome!!  Staff was amazing and food was wonderful. Go for the table-side Guac! Ask the wait-staff for recommendations; They've been bang on each time."}
{"text":"Delicious food and gracious, helpful service. Lovely place for a date or a meal with friends!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch and was pleasantly surprised  at the food.for a chain restaurant,the service was excellent and the food was very good. The seafood enchiladas were great as was the trio appetizer. Id definitely go back because deciding what to get was the worst thing about this place"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times now and I do enjoy coming to eat here every now and again. Good-sized portions, and their cornbread is just amazing. Favorite thing to get here is the street tacos (I'm a bit of a taco addict), but I want to try their veggie tacos as well. Good queso/nachos. Customer service is very good - the servers are friendly and accommodating. I love their teas; all unsweetened, but they've got great flavors. My favorite so far is the mango one, though the passion fruit is also good. Oh, and their tortilla soup is GREAT. That + cornbread + tea = the perfect comfort, recovery meal after a hangover."}
{"text":"The place was decent. It was one of my first dinners while I was in Phoenix for business.  The cornbread is yummy and the appetizer I had with shrimp with guacomole on a chip was amazing.   Can't remember what I ordered though....so that's why I'm giving it 4 stars.  It must not have been that good that I didn't crave for it enough to go back.  I was in Phoenix for 3 loooooong weeks.   They have Valet which is nice and there wasn't a long wait...is there ever in the Phoenix area?????    Leena"}
{"text":"Food is definitely high quality. Very impressed with their service. Great steering and view of mill. Food tastes great. Went there twice in one weekend!!"}
{"text":"I'd go back just for the Sunday brunch Mimosa bar!  You get your glass of champagne & then head to a little area set up by the bar. On one side you have the Mimosa section & on the other the Bloody Mary section.  I loved selecting the type of juice combinations & the fruit to drop in. I'm easy to please, lol!   The food was just ok. I got the GREEN CHILE BARBACOA ENCHILADAS . The taste was pretty bland & the beef a bit tough. I was expecting Mexican food taste, but this is definitely more TexMex, which is totally different. Next time I'll try something else.   This location is right off of Mill. Street parking is hard to snag, but there is a public parking garage less than a block away on 6th."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time to meet a client for lunch.  He selected this place because it was convenient for him and his office location.  Since I don't come down to Tempe very often, I didn't realize that there's free parking for this place if you dine here...so instead, I paid for metered parking down the street because it's hard to find parking in this part of Tempe during lunch.  After reviewing the menu, we decided to split Chips & Salsa, $5 for an appetizer and I ordered a Hickory Burger, $10.75.  The Chips & Salsa was pretty good but the Burger was excellent!  Not only is it full of flavor, but it's huge and juicy....great tasting, but I shouldn't have had it for a business lunch....it could've been a disaster because it's pretty messy.  I lucked out and didn't get it on my clothes.  Next time, I will order it for dinner.  Service was good and the lunch was successful.  Looks like this place would be fun for happy hour...will have to give that a try sometime.  Return Factor - 90%"}
{"text":"Z'Tejas is not a place I would go out of my way for in terms of the straight-up quality of the food. It's somewhere between ok and good. I've tried a few of the entrées but none of them really stick in the memory. The cornbread is good. I do end up there alot for after work margaritas and the Tejas Trio (chips with quac, salsa and queso). The chips are good. Also I wish they were open later. It's hard to find a quiet place in this hood that's open late night. Also, I've ended up having some pretty great conversations at this place and that must mean something... they just haven't been conversations about food."}
{"text":"Great margaritas and good atmosphere. The food is decent, but I don't go there for the food."}
{"text":"Late evening on a week night and we were hungry. We phoned around to a few places and decided to come here. It was a short drive from where we were staying but Ztejas has never disappointed before. I used to go in Vegas and loved their Diablo Chicken Pasta. I am sure if I had ordered that, I would be giving the place a 5. But, I decided that I had been eating a lot like I was on vacation and probably needed to be a bit more sensible. I got a grilled chicken salad and SG got the fajita special.  They bring out corn bread to start with honey butter (needs more honey in that honey butter.) It comes out in this great little cast iron skillet. It is soo good. But do not get carried away, because your meal portions will be large too. My salad was big, but the bowl was bigger, making it look a little small. It had one chopped up grilled chicken breast and some delicious spicy ranch dressing. There was corn and beans in the salad too, so I felt like I was getting more vegetables. SG's fajitas were good. There was grilled meat and peppers, some salsa, guac and cheese. Only three tortillas come with the plate, but they are resonably sized.   We both ordered bottomless iced teas and had them filled about a million times. Our server was great. She was fun and lively and the service was really good.   This place is very good and I would go back to this or any of their locations. The food is always good quality. Best try that diablo chicken pasta sometime if you like spicey, creamy, yummy chicken pasta."}
{"text":"came here for dinner with my roommate. nice place. our waiter was super cute. =) i had the seafood enchiladas and my roomie had the chicken enchiladas. both were very good. i love that they serve complimentary cornbread. it was really yummy. i also had the guava mojito, really tasty but had very little alcohol in it. it wasn't very busy considering it was a friday night. they even have complimentary valet for diners. you can't beat that."}
{"text":"Z'Tejas was ok...  Went there for some drinks and desert after dinner elsewhere.  Staff was friendly but not that attentive.  Drinks were fine and prices were on point of what I expected.  Did get this brownie pie thing, and it was really good.  However, I would have a hard time recommending this place with my experience.  I am not against going back and would give them another shot for real food, but if that happens I will make sure to update."}
{"text":"Delicious, drinks and dining are always impeccable. Never have had a bad experience. This is a once a month Sunday dinner with the girls event. The margaritas are delicious. The corn bread in the pan adds a little country to the dining experience. The service has always been on point. Drinks refilled before anyone passes by and I have to ask, the cadence of appetizers, entrees and desserts is always great. Never have to rush to finish my salad or finagle plates around on the table."}
{"text":"I wouldn't say they have the best this or that in the Valley.  However, you can always count on this place to be consistent with decent food and good service."}
{"text":"This is going to have to be a mixed review the server we had was not very attentive however the food we were served for brunch was delicious absolutely amazing and flavorful very fresh. The strawberry margarita hits the spot was delicious but the muffin that comes with the brunch was dry yet the fruit was perfect. The amazing breakfast quesadilla makes it definitely worth the trip to come back"}
{"text":"Ordered off of uber eats. Delivered everything relatively well expert the nachos which were one isn't clump. The street tacos were great as was there rice and beans with it and the salsa they provide is a great garnish for the tacos."}
{"text":"I'm recently trying out a gluten free diet, so I came to ZTejas knowing they have a g-free menu. I had their veggie tacos and they were amazing! Our server was also very considerate and warned me that the corn bread was not g-free. Big fan, I'll be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Who DOESN'T want a margarita at 3 in the afternoon?!  I was headed to Gammage for the Broadway show Wicked.  I started with a double shot of Cabo Wabo Anejo and a 20th Anniversary Marg.  Nice way to kickstart the evening!  Enjoyed a Z Salad (my fave) and an order of cast-iron skillet dumplings.  Both were absolutely delicious!  I had to keep after the waitress for water, cornbread and MY CHECK!!  I was almost late to the show because she took 20 minutes getting my check to me!    Interesting, though, was the fact that I had originally ordered a different tequila shot and the waitress returned to tell me they were out of it, so I ordered the Cabo Wabo.  It wasn't until a few days later that I looked at my receipt and noticed she had still charged me for the first shot (they were out of).  $10.25!!!  Did I say it was $10.25?!!  OUCH!!!   I immediately contacted the restaurant and spoke to a manager named Angela.  She was extremely helpful and immediately resolved the situation.  Not only did she refund the $10.25 to my card, but she also sent me $20 in gift certificates!  No worries, Z'Tejas -- I'll be back!!  Love this place!"}
{"text":"i went here a number of years ago so i can't truly remember what i had but it was alright."}
{"text":"Great margaritas!!! Two are more than enough to get very tipsy (although I am lightweight and one was enough for me). I have not been to many restaurants here where cocktails taste like cocktails and not like diluted with water syrup.   Food was delicious too: not too greasy, not too spicy, and no heartburn after! Anyway, I can't wait to go back soon."}
{"text":"this review is for happy hour. ooh, i like that the happy hour was available throughout the restaurant (some places just offer it in the bar). heres what i think of the appetizers we had:  shrimp tostada bites - okay good spinach quesadilla - okay good catfish tacos - okay dumplings - good plus cornbread - excellent  also tried a couple drinks - margaritas. this place is good for the drinks! also noticed that shortly after happy hour ended, the place emptied quite a bit. so it seems like a lot of ppl come here for happy hour. then again it was a weekday.. our friend, a local, did mention it gets pretty busy on friday nights..  last thought: decor kinda reminded me of a southwestern cheesecake factory.. go figure."}
{"text":"just had lunch at Z-Tejas in Tempe with three co-workers.  Friendly smiling happy waitrons, and excellent service; constant attention to refills of water, iced tea, and colas.  four different salsas plus guacamole and excellent chips.  I had the Daily Special which was green mole' chicken enchiladas - excellent; served with very good black beans and Spanish rice.  Dude had avocado turkey burger with chipotle aioli sauce. cleaned his plate Ladies had Parmesan pecan chicken salad and the Five-cheese Macaroni & Achiote Chicken and raved about both. dessert was a shared warm apple-berry cobbler with ice cream, Yummy and plenty. In and out in just over an hour, but we were in no hurry and lingered.  Surprisingly good sized crowd for a Wednesday lunch in downtown Tempe in late July - the reasons are as noted in my review - very good food and excellent service too."}
{"text":"We've eaten a few times and each time (knocks on wood) the service has been great and the food has been really good.  Lots of great flavor and the portions are not over the top.   Parking can be a little bit of a pain on a busy night... but... other than that... we will go back again next time we are in Tempe.  Well worth the trip."}
{"text":"Had dinner there last night the food was excellent so much so the appetizers were so filling I was unable to order a main meal.  I would recommend only ordering appetizers initially and seeing where that takes you. I ordered the shrimp enchiladas as an appetizer along with the green chili verde. You can't go wrong with the two appetizers.  The frozen margaritas at five dollars apiece were very good, a bit small but you cannot go wrong. The bartenders and managers were all exceptionally polite, made me feel welcomed and offer me suggestions on the different types of food or drink they served.   The location is on sixth Street and parking is limited however they offer free valet service"}
{"text":"I generally will order chile rellanos when I visit a Mexican restaurant for the first time.  Wow!  Was I surprised after that first taste of Tempe's Z Tejas' Smoked Chicken Chile Rellanos!  Not just a plain stuffed chile but loaded with chicken, fruit and pecans!  Certainly the most creative and tastiest dish I have ever experienced of Mexican faire!  I will definitely make another trip there just to order this outstanding meal!"}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for dinner. We got there around 5:20 and were told it was a 20 minute wait to sit on the patio. There were several empty tables but I assumed they had a wait because there were not enough servers. After 20 minutes we were seated at one of the tables that was empty the entire time we waited. Once we were seated we continued to wait about 5 minutes to be greeted by our server. We almost got up and left but for some reason decided to stick it out. The food was good- we had the table side guacamole, chicken avocado sandwich and enchiladas. The red sangria and margarita were also good but it took 20 minutes to get them. Overall just slow service and I couldn't really figure out why as they weren't that busy. I hadn't been here in several years and do not think I will be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Oh this CA girl who formerly believed Z'Tejas was Tex-Mex. Now being a recent Austin resident, I know this is not Tex-Mex. I was not happy that I had to valet my car-this is not the type of restaurant that needs it. I guess it's due to the high density of restaurants & shops as well as the close proximity to campus that makes this a necessity. I guess it's helpful.  I like the happy hour deals on appetizers, which means I did not spend as much money. Enjoyed the dumplings; Ahi was ok; pulled-pork nachos were meh; catfish tacos not so much.  My Z'Tejas Saviors: Corn Bread. I will go back just for the corn bread. Tableside guacamole-yes please! The portion is too big for just two people though and I really doubt anyone would want to bring it home."}
{"text":"I had the best time at this location! The atmosphere was amazing and the staff were very attentive. Thank you Luis for attending to my family with the utmost attention.  Our food was great, fast, and delicious."}
{"text":"Great Tex-Mex Food. This restaurant is always my Go Too Place for lunch and dinner with friends and client's when I am in Tempe AZ."}
{"text":"Great food, nice atmosphere, solid service.  My only knock is it's a bit pricey in the value area."}
{"text":"In a word:  happy hour appetizers = cheap, filling, and tasty dinner.  This is another fantastic safety for an out of town guest who likes their dining \"uniquely generic.  I know if I took my grandma here, she would love the corn bread.  I know my mom has a thing for the margueritas as they are novel and not too tequila-y for her (very low) alcoholic tolerance, but alcoholic enough so that if I take even a sip from a second one, I feel it."}
{"text":"It's kinda funny- I avoided this place because I am not a fan of Mexican food, generally.  But this ended up exceeding all expectations. Nice, upscale Southwestern fare, great bar, great wait staff. Sadly, no wings.  But they had a nice array of imports, free awesome cornbread at the bar (so much for low carb),and really great salads and sandwiches. My co pilot has been there often. So I got to try multiple menu items.  I cannot tell you how good the grilled veggie torta was Mounds of fresh veggies with a glaze on a grilled roll. The grilled steak/ mango salad was spicy and full of nuts, cheeses and veggies. Great for large groups, singles, couples. Clean and open, casual or dressy fine here. All types and characters. I didn't see any coeds, the place is not cheap, but I did get to see game 2 of the World Cup and have a great meal. Perfection."}
{"text":"I'm not usually a fan of chain restaurants, but this place had great service and the food was good. We stopped in for a late evening dinner while on vacation with our two kids. I was impressed that the staff not only managed to not cringe when we walked in with two young kids, but they were really overly attentive and made sure to get their drinks and food out asap."}
{"text":"Best house Margarita in town!  I like them on the rocks, but the bartenders here always tell me the frozen ones are stronger.  Anyway, if you go in during happy hour, go nuts on the appetizers because they're all cheaper.  I would have to recommend the tostada bites and the pot-stickers."}
{"text":"Great food, service, and atmosphere. They have the best margaritas in town. I am a regular at this particular location and I always leave extremely satisfied. They also have great happy hour specials and on the weekend they offer brunch. When the weather is cooler the patio is the place to be."}
{"text":"It was alright. Nothing to write home about. Hence the lack of review. The Grilled Shrimp thing was pretty good. The service was good, our waiter was very attentive.  My only mistake is that I mistook the green sliced vegetable on top of the pasta as green bell peppers (which I love)..turns out after a few bite in my mouth I realized it was jalapenos! (which I hate) You can image my shock."}
{"text":"Ok.  I might have given a four out of five stars if the server could pay attention to the tables that he was meant to service.  Instead, on a slow Tuesday night in April, the service was wanton of care.  When I asked about the differences in the margaritas on the menu, the server CLEARLY lied and did not attempt to hide it.  LEARN YOUR MENU THEN PRESENT IT.    Done with that critique, a few of the nice things did not include the nachos ( mediocre) but the ambience and the rest of the meal was actually ok.  Just needed help getting past the initial brawl with apathy. And who can afford to have apathetic service??  Sorry.  I said I was done with the negative side.   Hours later, I emerged less than emaciated yet energized and enthused that I would be able to have the rest of my steak at the hotel... in a nice friendly environment...   SO...I would go again but I will probably not."}
{"text":"Food was good, drinks were good, service was really slow. We had a party of 8. It took probably 10+ minutes to get out first drinks. Then some appetizers get delivered to our table... We didn't order anything yet, so waitress takes them away to find correct table. After that we put in our appetizer orders and continued to wait. Finally the apps came out. Had to wait more on additional drinks. Once we're got to the main meal everything lolled and tested good. Not sure if I will go back based on the slow service.  Don't get me wrong I like not being pestered by waitstaff, but this was more of just not being around."}
{"text":"I'd have to say z tejas has been consistently good We usually go on Sundays when they have the bloody mary and mimosa bar I'm a fan of their spicy Bloody Mary mix They need to have the FREE jalapeño bacon as one of the garnishes for the Mary's though!"}
{"text":"I'm addressing this review to the Z'Tejas in Tempe, since I like the sidewalk dining there better, but it applies equally to the one in Fashion Square, Scottsdale.  It took me a couple of visits to warm to this place, but since they started serving the skillet corn bread and I've discovered the Catfish Beignets and Ancho Chile Fudge Pie, I'm hooked."}
{"text":"I have to give Kudos to the Chile Relleano and the Cabo Grand Margaritas.....so good...just order those 2 things and you'll probably come back.  I have had their tuna...it's okay...the mac n' cheese chicken thing is pretty awesome and usually don't get too many apps so I can't comment.....next time I want to hit up the Achiote stuffed pork tenderloin...and if any yelper has had them and wants to send me their thoughts I'm open.  I love Z-tejas because it's really pretty solid and margaritas are stiff"}
{"text":"I guess I would call this tex-mex ish.. I ordered the blackened catfish tacos.. they were excellente.. They also serve some cornbread with your meal that is wonderful.. Our waiter was super nice, and cute..   I went for lunch so it wasn't crowded at all and we didn't have to wait."}
{"text":"I went here once a very long time ago and I had something I wasn't quite found of. I gave it one more try and I'm so happy I did! I love coming here now and I probably get the wild mushroom enchilada every time. The service is the reason I am writing a review! To start we were at the bar and Jorge was serving, he was awesome and then we moved to a nice table outside and shelby was our server. They were both so nice and engaging it made the food and experience even better!"}
{"text":"Absolutely adorable place: delicious dishes, excellent service, beautiful decor with modern art paintings and Arizona and Texas State Flags on the wall.  Z'Tejas means \"the Texas\". They serve a good mix of Mexican and American food.   The presentation of the food is amazing as well. Pretty heavy though, think we over ordered, but omgosh they are all fantastic picks!"}
{"text":"Wow, what's up with all the negative reviews? First of all this isn't a \"Mexican\" food restaurant, it's Southwestern, which does include Mexican, as well as Native American and Spanish, with a mix of Louisiana flavor thrown in . The food is colorful, flavorful and spicy. (What us southwestern boys like.)   The cornbread served hot in a cast iron skillet is a nice touch. They have a huge selection of tequila and an assortment of drinks. The chips are salsa are always a great way to start. I've been here many times and I try something new on every visit. I've never been disappointed. I tried the the Citrus Flanked Steak last night and it was seasoned perfectly and cooked to perfection. I really wanted to get the Ancho Fudge PIe (made with almonds and pecans and pinch of ancho chile) but I often feel too fat so I skip dessert.   The service is friendly and decent. Z'Tejas is one of my favorite places in downtown Tempe."}
{"text":"Hands down one of my favorite restaurants. I have tried many different things and they are all amazing.   9/10 times you get great service.   The managers really seem to care about gluten free customers and not cross contaminating the utensils (or at least they say they do!). Love this place."}
{"text":"This was one of the absolute worst restaurant experiences I have ever had. I have patronized this chain for years and have never been this dissatisfied. My party was a reservation of 20 on a Saturday night. We were the only patrons on the restaurant and our food and drinks came out late and cold. The rice and beans were undercooked. The pasta was soggy. No one ever came back to check on us after the food was served.  It was a horrible experience"}
{"text":"I don't think that Southwestern food is really my thing.  I think that Tex Mex is kind of more flavorful.  Nice decor and good service though.  They have free cornbread.  It was decent... tasted like a mix.  I had the seafood enchilades.  Apparently they don't know enchilades mean.. they made it more into a quesadilla.  It had more fish than anything else.  But maybe I just don't know what good Southwest food is.  Busy spot though."}
{"text":"First time to Z'Tejas. I've heard a bit about it, and one of my co-workers also works here. I honestly thought it was like a fancy Chipotle.   Really nice place, with valet (+). We got in and were quickly seated. My friend had eaten there once before, so he took the lead. We got a Corona (him) and a Midori 'tini (me) to start. Drinks are a little up there (my cocktail was $8) but let's say I was splurging.   To start, we got the Tejas Trio (salsa, guac, and queso), as well as these guacamole, shrimp, whatever. I'm not a fan of shrimp or quac, but I gave it a try and I have to say it was a little tasty. The queso was also really good, the salsa and quac average.   For our meals, he got the barbacoa, and I got the chicken enchiladas. My dish was really good, my only complaint is that there was hella black beans and a small amount of rice. I would have preferred it the other way, but everything on the plate was good.   I wouldn't come here on a whim with some of my friends, but it's a really nice special occasion place."}
{"text":"I always forget how great of a spot this place is for happy hour. However, when we went last week, happy hour ended at 6pm instead of 7pm like it says on their website (please update this or change it back to 7pm for those of us who get off work at 5).  Their grilled shrimp and guacamole tostada bites are the best ($8 during HH) and where else can you get seared ahi tuna for $8 during HH? The portions are pretty good too. Also, you can't go wrong with their complimentary corn bread. It has real pieces of corn in it and is delicious! I don't think I've ever had anything here that I didn't like.  Their chambord margarita and patron fruzion frozen margaritas are great too!"}
{"text":"Z Tejas Chain restaurant with predictable yet decent food. Here are the reasons I go there.  The best Chambord Margaritas and Peach Mojitos you will ever have! They are very overpriced but so potent you won't even feel the dent in your wallet after 2. Yea I said it - 2. They cut you off at 3 (but if you're at a table you can sneak one at the bar :)  Food that keeps me coming back~ Chicken Artichoke Mushroom Stack Miso Salmon Shrimp Tostada Bites  Happy Hour is decent 1/2 off Apps $1 off Drinks   Sunday's Make your own Bloody Mary Bar (with your preference of vodka) $3 Mimosa 3$ Hash Scramble  Corn bread, corn bread, corn bread!"}
{"text":"Appetizers came with our dinner which of course shouldn't. Cornbread & catfish nuggets appetizer were really good though. After all the raving my coworkers did, I expected better"}
{"text":"The margaritas and the shrimp tostada bites are amazing!!! This is a great place for happy hour, especially with a big crowd since they take reservations and let you order off the happy hour menu from anywhere in the restaurant. I like the appetizers much better than the rest of the menu which is a little bit pricey and I think less tasty. But I do love Z'Tejas happy hour! I also LOVE that they have free valet which is super-convenient for Mill Ave.!"}
{"text":"Phenomal seafood enchiladas and steak fajitas! Service was out of this world - Ray outdid himself! The margarita was tasty, as were the avocado and shrimp tostadas and the chocolate fudge pie! Love the patio, love the people, wouldn't miss Z Tejas next time we make it to Tempe!"}
{"text":"Ate lunch here last week, and food was good. Me and my fiance had the salmon and it was cooked to perfection. Shared the enchilada, and it was also good. The cornbread is delicious, perfect when hot, and just as god later when it is cold. Prices are fair."}
{"text":"Great corn bread! Everything is average in taste, service is good but you can get bored of it soon as they do not change their menu or make new stuff"}
{"text":"Just like every eatery, it is hit or miss with the service.  However this time, what's notable is the shrinkage of the menu and the quality of service."}
{"text":"Service was terrible, beer was flat, and food was bearable. We went for Easter and had reservations. Place was empty, which ought to have cued us in. Still, it took 15 minutes to get a table. It all went downhill from there."}
{"text":"Superb quality and customer service! Great teamwork among the staff. A pleasurable atmosphere. Amber and Shawn have the establishment in the best interest!"}
{"text":"I wrote a review of this place back in mid-September and gave it only 3 stars... what the fuck was I thinking?   The food here is fucking brilliant... especially for a chain. Amazing burgers. Their Diablo Chicken pasta dish is to die for. The cornbread is actually good - I fucking hate cornbread and yet I'll scarf this shit down like it's crack. Their chips and salsas aren't that great - they'll do the job, but I'm still not convinced about them. I'm also unimpressed with the sides that come with the mains, but I don't come to this place to eat the sides.   As I've said before, their margaritas are awesome. They'll fuck you up though, so make sure you have a ride home or else go see a movie to sober up.   The atmosphere is low-end upscale and pretty nice and cozy - kinda dark inside and a bit generic, but generic is better than flashy, ugly and distracting. Service is upscale as well and I'm usually pretty pleased with it. They offer free valet parking for customers too which is perfect now that they charge an arm and a leg for the parking structure.  Here's my old review for reference:   Great margaritas to be had here... really strong and tasty. This location isn't very busy ever it seems... perhaps with Fat Tuesdays around the corner, it's just too much competition.  It's a good place to grab a strong margarita before heading over to the movies or something. Their food doesn't inspire me to eat there, so all I've had are appetizers so far... mainly chips and salsa.  Salsa sucks.  It's also got some competition from Macayos down the street which doesn't help. I don't know if this place can stay in business much longer unless it gets busier. It could just be the times I was there though."}
{"text":"The food is good , service is good, but Sunday night they were playing music too loud and acid rock does not go well with dinner."}
{"text":"After a long, tough, tiresome, frustrating day of air travel, we had a forced layover in Phoenix. The layover hotel didnt have a full service restaurant. The front desk rep recommended we go to Mill Street, which is 2 miles away and full of restaurants, shops, etc.  We wanted something not too divvy and bar like (the university is nearby, so there are many of these places), and not upscale. We decidedjjjkl to eat at Z Tejas, right off of Mill Street. Beautiful looking place, fun, inviting. Z Tejas has outdoor patio seating, complete with heat lamps. We decided to sit inside. Upon entering the crescent main doorway you encounter a huge bar, cathedral ceilings, fun music, cool mod lighting, lively, beautiful inviting mexican decor (not overly done) and plenty of seating.   Bartender was totally cool and friendly. I had a Chipoltle Margarita (for those of you who like it spicy. Literally! complete with a red hot pepper as the garnish.). After I drank 1/2 of it, I asked the bartender if he could 'tone it down' a bit, which he did gladly, and shook me up another full (milder) drink. Impressive.  Seating was quick. Our waiter, Jay, was attentive, a bit snarky but knowledgeable and edgy. We liked him. We didn't want to order full meals, and were more interested in just drinks and a few appetizers. He recommended the Street Tacos and Chile Verde, which we now HIGHLY recommend! The food was beyond good. So flavorful, and seriously enough for 2 people to share (we started with their famous homemade cornbread, that came in a black skillet, the size of a small dessert plate. More than enough!)  GREAT place to dine!"}
{"text":"5 star margaritas (even for a house recipe) and selection of homemade salsas! I might even give the ambience 5 stars but the locals probably wouldn't be as generous... being from Michigan, I was just so happy to sit outside, on a patio, in the sunshine, in the middle of January.  In total, we ordered a 2 frozen & 2 on rocks margaritas, chips & salsa and split the mushroom spinach quesadilla as our main dish.   You get a free corn bread skillet at this location.  It's a very generous portion and tasted pretty good but we took most of it as leftover. I would've preferred the chips & salsas to be complimentary regardless of how cliché that'd be.    Overall, the food was all better than I expected it to be. The ingredients seemed fresh with good color and texture at each bite. This isn't your commercial chain tex mex; it's good food and drinks full of care and hospitality from kitchen to table service.  I heard they had wicked happy hour deals starting at 3 but we missed the window of time by a couple hours."}
{"text":"I paid my first visit to Z-Tejas during a nice bike ride in Tempe because a co-worker of mine claimed they had a great happy hour. I have passed by this restaurant numerous times and didn't think anything special would come from a visit. I had the notion that this was another typical Mexican chain that was most likely overpriced and overrated. I can only speak for their happy hour, but it was probably one of the best happy hours around town! Everything was so cheap and great quality! I swear by their Chambord Margaritas...They are only $5 and although they seem smaller than expected, they pack a killer punch and tastes great! I was not expecting to feel that kind of buzz from one margarita! They definitely pour heavy with the alcohol!! We were planning on hitting the Chuck box for dinner afterwards so we decided to try an appetizer off of the happy hour menu just to give it a try and munch on a snack until we finished our drinks. That did not happen. We were sooooo full from the pork nachos appetizer that we could not even think about eating anything else. When the waitress brought them out, we were in shock and I guess it happens all the time because she immediately said, \" I know, they're huge and the biggest thing you can get for $5 anywhere.\" (LOOK AT MY PICTURE OF IT) Not only was it humongous, it was incredibly delicious!!! They are extremely generous with all of the toppings (and boy, do they have a lot of toppings). We asked for hot sauce and she brought out sriracha. At first we were like, sriracha? That weird, but she walked away and I love sriracha so I was like I'll give it a try, why not? WOW it surprisingly went perfect with the pork and cheese etc. I can't wait to come back for happy hour again because everything on the menu looked amazing!! Our server was so kind and funny. She was very helpful and helped us choose the perfect meal for the day! I think her name was Christina. I definitely recommend trying their happy hour!! I posted a picture of the HH menu and their hours are in there on the side. Happy Hour is 3-7 Mon-Fri and 2-6 on weekends. Do ITTTTTT!"}
{"text":"I went with some trade show friends, all of us from the East coast or Midwest- hoping for some good Tex-Mex. We were all disappointed with our meals.   We started with a dip platter (guac, queso, salsa) the salsa was horrible- the guac was bland and the queso- well, you can't screw up cheese too badly...as for the entrees, I had the recommended pasta dish, and the other two had enchiladas- again, bland all the way around.  Our server was very nice, but he took back 3 plates of practically untouched food and didn't offer any sort of replacement or discount (I know, we could have asked).   It's in a great neighborhood for shopping and people watching."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever the bartender Alexa was very disrespectful and ignored me the entire time. When I came into the restaurant i tried being friendly and speak to her as I had a really bad morning. She did not  offer me a menu And did not offer me chips and salsa. I had to ask for the menu and she did not want to speak to me the entire time I was there. I thought it's ok maybe she's quiet. Yet no that was not the case. She told me her manager would not serve me ??? I was confused and said I Have not even seen your manager may I speak to him? I literally had already had one of those days. You know the type when you finally sit down you just want to release and speak to another human. All she did was make it worse. I have been to this restaurant before but not had treatment like this. Just ignorance and rude. Than she started  yelling at me when I asked her why did you not even serve me a menu? I had to ask you? She started to yell at me. I'm not sure what made her make the decision to not serve me so I asked the manager and he said I am not sure. Worst treatment ever. they are not even able to explain their reasoning for their actions. The tostada bites were stale as well. Seriously that was my last time going there."}
{"text":"Somehow me and a couple of friends ended up wandering the streets of downtown Tempe and were in a dispute concerning where to eat. While trying to convince one of our friends that trying something new would be fun, I settled with Z Tejas, a place I was familiar with. I normally go to the Scottsdale Fashion Square location which I never have a problem with. The hostess was wonderful, super sweet. She was wearing glasses and a polka dot skirt. She engaged in conversation and seemed happy to be there. Our server on the other hand, was subpar. He was tan/colored with a buzzed head. He was less than enthused and didn't make us feel welcome at any point in time. He made our requests seem like a pain and was visibly annoyed with requests for a simple modification, such as holding off on the cheese of our guacamole. The guacamole was alright, but was definitely not worth 12$. Also my soda was flat. We assume our service was bad because we are a trio of teenagers, but our age shouldn't affect the service. We did not tip too well, not because of our circumstance, but because we felt we were a burden rather than welcomed guests."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and have enjoyed most of my experiences, whether they are attempting to break the 3 margarita limit or seeing how many happy hour shrimp tostada bites I could shove into my slobbering maw.  All of the food is at least satisfactory with a few real winners scattered about. The achiote chicken chopped salad is a fantastic almost-healthy entree, and the chicken, artichoke and mushroom stack is a bonanza of flavor.   If you wish to have an epic gastronomic experience and care little about stomach pains and other adverse, long term affects, then I highly recommend the 5-cheese macaroni and achiote chicken. This entree is not for the faint of heart.  If you are looking for the strongest and tastiest frozen margarita, the Frusion is the way to go. The ladies might prefer the Chombord variety, but you can't go wrong with any of them."}
{"text":"I want to preface this review by saying that I have not tried any of the dishes on Z Tejas' menu. This location was the second stop on our Friday-night drink/appetizer tour of Mill Avenue restaurants, and we decided just to focus on their margaritas, ordering chips and salsa just to have something to munch on. We sat in the bar area at one of the high banquettes. It took a few minutes for a server to come by and greet us, but to be fair, it was busy, and once she did come by, she was really friendly and attentive.   My sister and I ordered the famous Chambord Margaritas, and my husband got the house margarita. The margaritas came *really* quickly (a huge plus in my book), were well-priced (no more than $7 for any of them) and they were really good! The base margarita flavor was not overly sweet and you could definitely taste the tequila, and the Chambord in ours added a nice sweetness without being overpowering. My only gripe is that the Chambord ones didn't come with a salted rim; I like to at least be asked if I like salt on my margaritas. We also had to ask to have them on the rocks (I also like to be asked if I want my margaritas frozen or on the rocks). Those little complaints aside, we were really happy with the drinks. The chips and salsa were a little pricey ($4.49) and the salsa trio it came with wasn't particularly memorable, but they were a nice complement to the drinks.   From my brief glance at the menu, the food looks pretty standard and Americanized, but given how good our drinks and the service were, I'd be willing to go back and give Z Tejas another try for a meal."}
{"text":"Z Tejas exists for one reason and one reason alone, to sell awesome margaritas at not so awesome prices that you'll totally shell out for anyway because their massive strength will sucker punch you with the first sip and then bat you around like an orca playing with a baby seal right before going in for the kill.  Seriously.  Three of these things will have you giggling, slurring declarations of love to the members of your party, believing your sexiness status just gained +2, craving Jack in the Box tacos and possibly breaking a heel upon your exit.  They are a thing of beauty. (And the reason why they enforce a three margarita limit.)  Unfortunately, they'll run you 6 to 9 bucks depending on how much razzle dazzle you're going for. The Sixth Street Margarita is the most basic, frozen or on the rocks, and is delicious. So is the Z Top Shelf, and the Chambord, and the Frozen Watermelon, and the Grand Marnier, and I think you're sensing the trend here.  And the food... Well, it exists so you don't leave in the condition discussed above. It's not as good as the margaritas, but once you have a couple, you're really not going to care that much.  Brunch is the best time to hit this place up and indulge in a three dollar mimosa, their three dollar top shelf do-it-yourself bloody mary bar (with all the fixins, including beef jerky stir sticks!), or the epic margaritas. The chicken and potato hash is decent, but it used to be much better back when it was the savory sage chicken and potato hash and had, how do you say, actual flavor. Now it's just blah by comparison. Well done blah. But blah all the same (although Mr. Man loves it). So you may want to hit up the smothered burrito or jerk chicken salad instead, both of which are delicious.   Happy hour is also a pretty good deal, with one dollar off all drinks and half price appetizers. I'd recommend the Cast Iron Skillet Dumplings that are like crispy round Asian pot stickers that come out sizzlin' in sweet chile sauce or the Tortilla Soup, which is done really, really well here with avocado and lots of chunky chicken.   But forget the food. It's the backup vocals to the wailing showboat sex symbol of a lead singer that runs back stage for a mid show sex/drug/booze binge while his second tier stand-in entertains the crowd with a limp solo.   The margaritas are bad ass and they know it. Let 'em get a little saucy with ya.   Oh, and the patio rocks almost as hard as the margaritas, so make sure to be seated out there."}
{"text":"Z'tejas has always been a favorite but I was sadly disappointed when coming in today to learn they had changed their queso. New queso isn't bad but the original one is definitely better and was a staple I would crave and make a trip just to get. Please bring back the original queso!!! Also, they apparently now charge for cornbread which is fine since proceeds go to a local charity but the serving staff should be much more upfront about the charge since for years and years it was free. Thankfully it's only $3 so not a big deal, plus like I said proceeds go to a local charity which is nice.  In short, Please Please Please bring back the original queso!!!!  I spoke too soon. All around the food was really bad. The smoked chicken quesadilla hot the grossest synthetic smoke taste. We had to have the queso reheated because it didn't stay warm long enough to eat it. They were understaffed to service was really slow, and the catfish tacos were more like wannabe Asain infusion egg rolls.   All around bad experience and so much so that I will no longer have cravings for a once beloved eatery. Probably won't be coming back unless it's for a chambord margarita which is now the only saving grace."}
{"text":"Be careful during happy hour. Shocktop is considered a craft beer here so they will charge you more for it.  That said what is cool about this place is the Bloody Mary bar.  You can totally fill up your cup with almost anything and everything there and create your own mix of stuff.  After that the food is good and overall a great lunch stop."}
{"text":"Mediocre. They forgot our bottom less chips and our steak fries that came with our dinner! Our waiter was nice but still a little clueless. Food was alright"}
{"text":"Great food every time.  Had the season grill, and was very pleased. A lot of great flavors on that dish!"}
{"text":"The Seafood Enchiladas and three dip Chips were outstanding. We like the Happy Hour selection, even though it was a bit small. Very good food. Above average prices."}
{"text":"This is a large casual Mexican restaurant located close to the ASU campus.   I got the skinny margarita. It was pretty good. For appetizers we got corn bread --- not particularly flavorful. A bit disappointing.   For my main meal I got the burrito. It was large and flavorful, but I would say close to a fast food burrito rather than something delicious.   The  restaurant has a nice vibe. It's got a good ambience with high ceilings and a good bar."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a coworker.  The service was a bit slow, as you are supposed to get garlic bread prior to your meal we did not receive it until our meal arrived because the kitchen was backed up.    The food was good, but over priced compared to what you can receive at many other Mexican restaurants in the valley.  Wasn't exactly bang for your buck.  I ordered two enchiladas, which were excellent, but for $12, I could have gotten more else where.    Overall, I would recommend it, but I prefer other places."}
{"text":"Love eating here! Texas trio is so yummy I actually crave it. The margaritas are delicious. Service is always good and when the weathers nice its a great place to dine on patio. They have a great brunch as well. The build your own Bloody Mary and mimosa bars are awesome! I love bringing people here. Always satisfied!"}
{"text":"Wow!!!  Was here for brunch yesterday - food was authentic and amazing!!!  Smoked strawberry margaritas hit the spot - so yummy!!!!  I had Barbacoa Enchiladas- the beef was perfect, sauce so delicious, perfect balance!!! Highly recommend- service was excellent - my dining partner has a severe gluten allergy and the server went out of her way to make sure she was guarded and my friend still had an amazing meal!  Top notch!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time recently. I asked the waitress what to order because I am pretty picky and don't like a lot of the main ingredients in tex-mex (peppers, tomatoes, onions, etc). She said the mac and cheese with blackened chicken was amazing so I went for it. Honestly, it is the best mac and cheese I have ever had. You need to go and try it. I had everyone at our table try it and they all loved it. Also, their margaritas are delicious and they put a lot of alcohol in them which is always a plus. I plan on going there soon as now I am craving their mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Great place for a Friday happy hour! The chambord marg is top notch, achiote chopped chicken salad is to die for, and the trio appetizer is great ONLY when it's half price during happy hour.  Highly recommend but only hangup is the cocky manager, useless hostests, and unattentive servers.  After two margaritas you get over the staff :)"}
{"text":"I admit, i have passed on this place a few times just bcus i was not highly impressed with things i have read/heard but i finally gave them a shot. Nothing really knocked my socks off but nothing left me complaining or bitching either. they have a large menu and a good variety of original items but to be honest the description sounded a lot better than the actual taste of the food. Service was good and nice large space inside.   i was full and content but i wont be begging to go back again. I'm not a hater or a lover i guess you can say just a satisfied guest."}
{"text":"After the original cafe we had scheduled our book club at was closed, we decided to do brunch at Z'Tejas. The brunch options were kind of blah. I wanted to get peanut butter (or Jam) for my english muffin, but they didn't have any. I thought I'd try the french toast but didn't when they let me know that they didn't have syrup.   There are so many AMAZING breakfast and brunch spots in AZ, there really is no reason at all to go to Z Tejas for brunch. Maybe they should stick to lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"My bartender was Karina. She is the best! I came in on Saturday she told me about the $15 bottomless mimosas on Sunday. I came back today and she remembered me. The food is amazing and the service is amazing."}
{"text":"Sooo Good! The shrimp dumplings turned a non-seafood eater into someone who craved the dumplings later"}
{"text":"I went there for a business dinner while on a trip to Phoenix. The interior is nice and some in my party were happy with their meals. Some others including me weren't salivating for a return. I ordered a southwestern salad and a bowl of tortilla soup, Neither was good. Since I don't live there I'm sure I won't be going back. I am giving an overall 3 because some in my party liked their food."}
{"text":"Such a big place for being dead on a Sunday. Good food and good service. They got rid of a bunch of stuff on the menu and even heard others complaining too that they got rid of the 3 salsa thing they used to have, they were very disappointed and also got rid of some of their tunas."}
{"text":"Had the Diablo pasta with shrimp and it was pretty tasty! For a Saturday night with an ASU football game night, serving was quite fast and the food I've had, I do recommend the place but yet want to keep it a secret as well."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite happy hour spots on Mill. They have the best Chambord margarita's! Be careful though...they are strong. Another must order item on the menu is the Tejas Trio."}
{"text":"This place has great Mexican Food. Nice indoor or outdoor seating areas. The service was great everyone is very nice and accommodating. We tried the Dip Trio (Salsa, Guacamole & Queso) for appetizers, the Queso dip is Bomb.   For dinner I had the street tacos, they were great well seasoned meat and all the flavors were good. If I'm back in the Phoenix area in the future this is definitely a place I will come back to."}
{"text":"Food was yummy!!  Started with chips and salsa, guacamole, and queso.  All were very good.   The cornbread is super tasty too.  Got filled up too fast, but the chicken mac n cheese was so good, I ate half of it.... And I was full before it came out.  Service was terrific.  Food was delicious.  Restaurant is clean and comfy.  Not a very vast dessert menu, but chances are you wont have room.  We didn't. :)"}
{"text":"Had a great experience, with excellent service, great food, and a very understanding waitress who gladly accepted unwanted broccoli stems from our 2 year old.  Be happy to go back, even without kids."}
{"text":"I don't know if I would come here at any other time besides happy hour, because of the prices and my budget restrictions, but Z'Tejas has very strong margaritas that are definitely worth it and my god, that cornbread. Other than the cornbread, however, it wasn't a particularly memorable dining experience. I wouldn't go out of my way to make a return visit, but if someone suggested it and it was during their happy hour, I may give it another shot."}
{"text":"Disappointing. I had found this place ahead of time, and liked the menu so I brought a few friends from a conference we were attending. I'm from the East Coast so I was looking forward to some good Mexican food in Arizona. Ha. I've had better enchiladas in Delaware.   I ordered the Green Chile Barbacoa Enchiladas, which the waitress gushed about, but also because I had decided to get them ahead of time since they sounded great. Meh. No kick to them at all, but also there was really nothing inside them. They seemed small and empty. They looked real pretty on the plate, I'll give them that, but they were mild in taste. Sort of a tourist version of an enchilada. My friends were equally unenthused about their dishes, though they said they were \"good.\"   On the plus side, the corn bread they served us was tasty."}
{"text":"Always great food! Love this place. Especially the appetizers."}
{"text":"Tex-Mex at it's finest. We love the atmosphere, classy yet still casual. The music is always jazzy/bluesy and totally helps you wind down after whatever sort of day you've had.   Their happy hour is great; delicious margaritas, warm, bottomless tortilla chips with three salsas (the green one is some sort of chili, avocado, cucumber mixture that makes me shovel it in as fast as I can), and really good, made-in-front-of-you guacamole.  As far as entrees go I've only had the salads because I stick to the vegetarian menu (AND entrees are a little pricey...) but they have been superb. I'm a BIG fan of the Jerk (no chicken) salad. I could probably straight up drink the sesame-ginger dressing they put on it. Their portions are plentiful and me and the bf split the salad and order of chips, which came to about $16... BARGAIN!  And of course, the cornbread they bring out before your meal is AMAZING."}
{"text":"We love Z!  It was one if our favorite restaurants in Austin, so we were excited to find one in Tempe.  The Santa Fe enchiladas and Diablo Pasta are both fantastic, as are the margaritas."}
{"text":"The cornbread ROCKS it every time.  It sort of reminds me of Thanksgiving corn casserole.  And it's free!  I recently had the chili relleno and it was tasty but could have been heated up a bit more."}
{"text":"I haven't been here since college, and now I remember why.  the food is only so-so and the atmosphere is puzzling.  I don't want to listen to loudly-played Britney Spears when I'm trying to eat Tex-Mex type food.  as far as the food, some was good and some was not so good.  I liked the chopped salad, which came with avocado, sunflower seeds, black beans, chopped tomato, cabbage.  I ordered the seafood enchilada for my entree, and I did not enjoy that.  the salmon and other fish inside the enchilada tasted off, like fish that was getting old and almost to the point of being bad, but they still cooked it anyway.  I also wanted some \"spice\" to my food.  everything was sort of bland, which is really not what you want when eating Tex-Mex (or whatever Mexican fusion type of food this is supposed to be...)  my boyfriend enjoyed his steak burrito, but he also felt like the food was overpriced for what we got."}
{"text":"I have never been here before. Don't know how, z tejas has been around awhile but I came in right before happy hour ended. my server Vanessa was awesome and scored me beer right before it ended. She was really friendly and provided great service. I ordered the street tacos which were quite tasty!! Then I switched up and went to the bar to watch the rest of the finals. Both bartenders were fun and cool (didn't catch their names though) ordered a cheese cake. Smart move because it was delicious. All in all a good time."}
{"text":"First off, I would like to give a shout out to my server, Winter. She did an awesome job!!! She was on top of everything. She made great suggestions. I always had a full drink. Also, there was never a long wait in between courses.   Everything I had was very tasty.   - Cornbread - It wasn't the best I have ever had. I usually lean towards a sweeter cornbread, but it was still really good with the butter.  - Grilled Jumbo Quesadilla with Cilantro Pesto Grilled Shrimp - I loved the crunchiness of the tortilla and size of the shrimp in every bite.  - Southwestern Caesar Salad - My favorite part of this salad was the spicy kick to it.  - Grilled Miso Salmon - I think 3 different workers told me this was their favorite entree here. Every bite was heavenly. The miso sauce was sweet and compliments the medium rare salmon. Even the potato cake and vegetables that it came with were perfect and unique.  - Ancho Fudge Pie with Ice Cream - At first I was skeptical to try this dessert because it contained ancho chile, but it really intensified the chocolate flavor. I don't think I've ever had chocolate like this before.   Since I had an amazing experience, I'm afraid if I ever have Z'Tejas again and order anything, but the items above, I'll be disappointed. I suggest to anyone to give Z'Tejas a try, but you have to at least order the Grilled Miso Salmon."}
{"text":"Their Angus burger is incredible. So is their Smoked Chicken Chile Relleno. According to their website: \"Poblano pepper stuffed with a seasoned filling of smoked chicken, chopped pecans, apricots, jack cheese and raisins. Served with green chile mole, roasted tomato cream, Tejas rice and black beans.\"  Let me tell ya, it's so worth it!   The atmosphere is cool, too, although it gets a bit noisy Fridays around 6 p.m. The lighting is dim and it's conveniently located off Mill Ave, so you can always spring for Gelato after wards, or just wander the street, checking out stores and people watching."}
{"text":"Great salads and tacos. Friendly staff. Make sure to ask for cornbread it comes with dinner free, but our waitress forgot until we asked"}
{"text":"OMG- the cornbread!!! The cornbread was so good. I literally filled up on cornbread and drinks from happy hour. The food was pretty good as well. Our waiter was such a sweetheart. He was young guy, unfortunately I can't remember his name. Service was spot on and the speed of the food coming out was very fast. I'm deducting one star, just because I've had better food in the area."}
{"text":"I met a buddy here for dinner last night. Here is the lowdown:  Location: 5/5 Food: 5/5 Service: 5/5  Don't miss the cornbread, it's fantastic. We started out by splitting a bowl of chips and salsa. The salsa is fresh and very good. The chips were crunchy and not too salty. I had the green chili enchilada with black beans. Not normally a big black bean fan I was surprised how good these can taste when they are very fresh and well prepared. The rice was nice and fluffy and delicious. The waiter was cheerful and helpful with suggestions. The service was very prompt without hovering over us - not an easy balance to strike.   A nice bonus is that they will valet your car for free. Just get your ticket validated by your server. The location is right off Mill Ave. so you are right in the heart of the action. The prices are very reasonable as well. Most of the entrees are $10-15. This place is great, give it a try."}
{"text":"4 of us picked this place at the last minute on a Monday night after traveling from Tucson.  We were seated and served immediately.  We started with salsa and chips which we had to pay for but it was well worth it.  For $4.50 we received great chips with 3 different kinds of salsa and some outstanding corn bread.  We all had frosted margaritas which really hit the spot. Our entrees proved to be just as good.  I had Baked Seafood Enchiladas that had a delicious sauce and plenty of seafood--excellent portion as well.  My wife had the Smoked Chicken Chile Relleno which she really enjoyed and our friends had the Achiote chicken salad (said it was a great salad that she couldn't finished and saved for the next day) and one of their classic enchilada dishes with slow roasted beef.  We would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Food was great! Street tacos for the win! Service was pretty awesome especially since it was almost time for them to close!"}
{"text":"Yummy spot. I like that it's downtown Tempe and a nice sit down restaurant with a more restaurant vibe than a bar vibe. It's located right off Mill so be prepared to pay for parking. Outdoor seating is available for people watching. Nice place for families. High chairs weren't filthy like some places.   This was my second time coming here and I liked the food. Tried the chef's soup special which was a creamy crab bisque with corn and it had the perfect amount of spice to it. Ordered the bowl so I'll have left overs for lunch tomorrow :) Mushroom enchiladas are so yummy - not something I'd normally order but my husband had them last time and after trying his I've been craving them ever since - which is a large reason why I wanted to come back today :) Enchiladas come with rice and beans and a mango salsa. They also served us a corn bread in a cast iron skillet - on the house - with our soup. I didn't care for it too much but my husband liked it.   Service was good as waiter was quite attentive. Pleasantly surprised with the quality of food and service. It wasn't very busy at all but I believe both times I came on weekday evenings. Will definitely come back :)"}
{"text":"Came for hh on my bday.  5 dollar chambourd margaritas & 1/2 price trio conqueso dip!! Heaven!! Management & server made me feel very special on my bday with my friends"}
{"text":"This location of Z'Tejas gets four stars for happy hour and a convenient place to sit before a Sun Devils game (Go Devils).    Typically, we visit the Chandler location of Z'Tejas.  In comparison, the Tempe location is not quite up to par.    The check in process is laughable, with hostesses requesting your phone number to text you when your table is ready.  When you do give them your number, they either don't text you and just come find you or they forget about you altogether until you finally go check to see what the extended wait is about.    The food on our last visit was hastily prepared.  The seared ahi tuna appetizer, for example, was not consistent in appearance to the many other times we have ordered it.  The chips served with the trio were stale.  On another recent visit, the ahi chipotle citrus bites were nearly inedible and the street tacos were served at room temperature.  Yikes.  What was on point?  The drinks!  The bartender here deserves props for consistently getting the drinks right and strong.  Also, the servers have always been very sweet and attentive here.  Will I come here again?  Of course.  During football season it is one of my favorite places to go.  Would I drive to Mill Ave to come here?  No.  The Chandler location is much closer and the kitchen is much more consistent."}
{"text":"The food is very good. I didn't know they had table side guacamole until I read a review. I would have ordered it!  The salsa is wonderful and the chips are fresh and warm when they come out. The wait staff is top notch and professional.  But this place is awesome and I will come back."}
