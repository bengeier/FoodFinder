{"text":"I've been here twice. The first time, I got the pink lady roll, which I liked. The second time, I got the deluxe sushi, with a salad, miso soup, a variety of sashimi/sushi, and a california roll. The quality of fish was poor. The fish lacked flavor and had a soggy, watery texture which comes from thawing frozen fish. I did like the california roll that came with it. I'm wondering if I liked the pink lady roll the first time I came because the roll masks the texture/flavor of the fish with rice/veggies/sauces. So maybe it's wise to stick to rolls here. Unless I hear about Sake improving their quality of fish, I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Completely disappointed with everything. Ordered chicken and shrimp lunch meal, everything was over cooked and very bland. Without the \"yum yum\" sauce I would have thrown it away. 16 bucks for lunch, nothing special here. The spicy salmon rolls are better at a gas station. To sum it up BLAND BLAND BLAND. Save your money and order regular Chinese and get gas station sushi."}
{"text":"I agree with the fellow posters. Food is great. Service is excellent. Drinks are superb. My only complaint about this place is the management. I have been here two times in two weeks and I have noticed a manager change. The old one was older and well dressed, he was rude an didn't pay attention to his managerial duties. I guess that's why he has been replaced. But the new manager is far from better. We came in to the restaurant and was not greeted for about two minutes. When we were approached I thought this person was ready to go to the beach, not a manager of a restaurant. After we were seated, everything else was great. We were very soon greeted by our waiter who brought out our drinks extremely fast. Our orders were taken and our food was delicious. Will definitely come back again. The staff is nice, fast, and friendly. Only downfall is the management."}
{"text":"Sushi requires fresh fish. I don't think this place cares to stock it. Whether you choose nigiri pieces or sushi rolls, none of it tastes good. I don't usually give harsh reviews but their sushi was so bad, me and my boyfriend couldn't finish it. And we always finish sushi."}
{"text":"Love the food, that atmosphere and the happy hour specials.  The sushi is fresh and the presentation is beautiful, like a work of art.  Something that you definitely do not get at Nakama.  Service is amazing and they have great Happy Hour specials."}
{"text":"Well I went on Monday night for the happy hour specials. The place was clean and the staff was very cordial and pleasant. Service was immediate and I was happy that my waiter in no way rushed us because I stayed until the place was about to close. Also the $5 Martini's were excellent. However the sushi was ok but I have had better. The California roll was good, however my Philadelphia roll did not taste as fresh as I would have liked. Now don't get me wrong it was spoiled or sour but it could've been more fresh. However the price and service of that happy hour would absolutely have me revisit. Also the restrooms were very clean and smelled amazing!! So this place is average to me!!"}
{"text":"Great food- husband loved his sushi, spicy crab salad and miso soup and my pad Thai was fabulous- drinks and service. A welcome addition to south side works. We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Music from the bar so loud that the servers can't hear the customers. No wonder there are complaints about service. Our server almost pestered us with unwanted attention, trying to compensate. How do I know? Part of our order was wrong because he couldn't hear us.

The food is mediocre. Sushi restos do not stand out by making a more bizarre combination roll than anyone lse -- they stand out for high quality ingredients and execution. Sake does not measure up."}
{"text":"Do not get Lunch box. The katsu was dry. Fruits was canned pineapple which no one touched in my group.  Its not worth for $9."}
{"text":"This was our first time going to Sake. Food was ok, nothings special, but not bad either. Or server was not very knowledge of the type of sushi he was serving and tried to clean up our plates before I even finish my dinner. My husband asked for refill for his Coke-it never arrived.  I had  Groupon that I tried to use for dinner yesterday. Waiter informed us that we can't use it, because we did not ordered \"full price entree\". This is a sushi place-99% of their menu are sushi rolls. What is considered 'full price entree\"? we paid full price for sushi rolls that we ordered-why our coupon was not accepted? I guess that Japanese place does not considered sushi rolls as entree. Manager could care less-told us that's the way it is and we should read fine print. Well, fine print does not said that apparently in sushi restaurant you can't consider sushi as entree. When I asked him what is his definition of entree-he told me I have to educate myself and I will know. So, here it is. 2 stars for OK sushi, and minus 3 stars for service and rude manager"}
{"text":"Way overrated in my opinion, which proves how few restaurants in Pittsburgh offer quality sushi. Mediocre food topped with a poor experience/bad service left a bad taste in my mouth. I don't intend to return. 

Service:
We went with the expectation of receiving the happy hour special despite it being a Saturday. At that time, the special was listed on their website and didn't specify days it was not offered. I even called and had this confirmed before going. When we got there and asked if we could order from the happy hour menu, we got a blank stare and then the manager. He informed us that it was a mistake and we must have searched the menu of another restaurant. I even pulled it up on my phone to show him, at which point he then said he couldn't give us that option. Didn't offer anything extra to us, a discount or a sincere apology. In my opinion, that's a poor way to apologize to a customer- even a simple free appetizer would have been enough to win me over. Incredibly disappointed. 

Food:
We ordered a few sushi rolls. Like many places in Pittsburgh, it was nothing special. The salmon and tuna were mediocre in regards to freshness. Even without the bad experience, I would offer it 3 stars at best. 

Ambience:
A bit confusing. Modern trendy and then throw on a couple of neon lights and old looking table cloths. I didn't care for it much. The only plus was the doors, which could open up the restaurant on a nice day or evening."}
{"text":"Contrary to popular belief, Nakama is not the only good place to get sushi in southside. Plus who can beat 50% on Sundays and Mondays! My favorite are the Miami Heat roll (avoid if you hate super fishy sushi) and the sweetheart roll!"}
{"text":"I ate here because of a groupon promotion and you get a good amount of food but it's not worth the money you pay. The food was bland and the sushi was mostly rice. I was disappointed but only ate there twice and wouldn't recommend it to true sushi lovers."}
{"text":"Personally, I'm not a sushi person but they have other great appetizers! I like the Gyozo, and if you go during happy hour, there's have price apps and drinks. Service isn't bad, everyone is friendly and the inside has a lovely decor!"}
{"text":"Stopped by around 11:15, which is 15 minutes after they open, as posted on their website, yelp, and their door. I was looked at like I had three heads and told \"we just got here, we aren't open!!\". Their doors were open, their neon sign on, and LOOKED open, so I'm not sure what the problem was. Will not return or recommend to my colleagues."}
{"text":"In all honesty, I only really come to this particular sushi joint because they have phenomenal specials compared to just about everywhere else. That being said, the sushi is not the BEST I've ever had in my life, but it's still very good. Rolls are pretty large and mostly of good quality. I personally stay away from anything labeled as \"spicy\" because that tends to entail some pretty gross ground-up fish concoctions. But a filling sushi lunch for two that comes out to only around $20-$30 is fine in my book. I would recommend the \"Pink Lady Roll\" and the \"South Side Roll.\" Outdoor seating is also a plus!

The ambiance is a little bit tacky--how about that erotic blown-up photo \"art\" of a naked girl next to the bar? Reminds me of something that might be in an Asian softcore porn magazine from 1998. I'd say the other locations of the Saga chain are a little bit more tasteful, but those don't offer as many discounts. Also, posters advertising \"Salsa dance night\" ($5 cover!) and \"Ladies night\" (along with the plethora of misspellings on the menu, ie: \"Labstor Roll\") make for a fun experience if you have a certain sense of humor. Loud top 40 music is kindof annoying when I'm hungover on a Sunday afternoon trying to get in my weekly raw fish fix in tranquility. 

Overall, thank you Sake for satisfying my sushi cravings without breaking my wallet."}
{"text":"We checked Sake out on a cold Saturday night and were pleasantly surprised. The service was pleasant and the food quite good. Best of all, it wasn't a zoo and we didn't have to wait an hour for a table."}
{"text":"Went here recently with a friend on a Groupon.  The staff was nice, and the food was good (I got some vegetarian rolls, and the sake was pretty good).  The decor was nice and seemingly upscale- I just wish the restaurant embraced the cuisine and wish it was a bit more traditional Japanese.  The pop music being played clashed with everything the restaurant should be about."}
{"text":"I really like the sushi here.. we always seem to get the sushi for 2 which is 16 pc of assorted sushi along with a spicy tuna and california roll, the sushi is always prepared well. The reason i gave 4 stars and not 5 is due to the wait staff. Most of the time when we come here we only see our server to place our order and then get the check, so to get a refill we would have to flag some one down. With the exception of our most recent visit, we had a female server and she was wonderful! She took our orders in an efficient manner and checked on us a couple times before the time came for the check. Also the hot food is not the best, it is under seasoned. I would definitely only recommend coming here for the sushi"}
{"text":"Took the girlfriend here for a date. Very impressed. The restaurant is very clean, the service was excellent and the food was fantastic. If you're looking for a place to eat in the Southside Works this should be on your short list."}
{"text":"I didn't notice this until my friend pointed it out, but Sake looks like it could be a nightclub or lounge. The interior is very fancy and clean. I like the intimate feel of the décor. However, with the amount of typos on the menu, you could probably make a drinking game out of it. I was lured in by the 50% off happy hour special. The service was wonderful and the owner is such a jolly man. 

I had their BJ roll. Yes, let the giggling begin. What is implied by \"BJ\", you ask. I asked the waitress the same question and she had no idea. But, after my \"BJ\" roll arrived on a plate, I got a good laugh at the loaded name too. The roll was lightly battered and fried. There was a generous drizzle of spicy mayo sauce along the length of the roll. It was filled with several types of cooked fish. The sushi was just average, edible but nothing to go crazy over. I do enjoy the hidden humor and creative display though. \"BJ\" roll will be a story I'll tell over and over again. 

I had a great dinning experience and the prices weren't too bad after the happy hour discounts. The sushi was average, but service was great. I probably won't go out of my way for sushi here, but if I'm in the area then I'll drop by. Definitely take advantage of the 50% off specials on the weekdays!"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE! !!! I used the grubhub app to order from here Sunday evening.  My food arrived on time but the order was missing the rice that went with my daughter's dinner of \"show gun chicken\", Which was essentially just chicken nuggets that were 50% breaded cartlidge. I called the store and told them about the rice,  I was told that I could come to the store to get the rice because no manger was present to authorize a refund. My daughter and I decided to just let it go and forgo the 2.14 $ rice. I had ordered udon that was in two separate containers,  one for noodles and vegetables and one for the broth. As I spooned my noodles into the broth, I found a black hair buried in my noodles. When I called the manager, he was defensive and  rude and never once appologized. He was reluctant to authorize a refund. Never again."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I decided to try out Sake last night while on a road trip to the Burgh.  We were pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere immediately upon arriving, and the Host was very personal and remembered our names the entire evening up until we left.  Before our water was even out, the sushi chef presented us with a very impressive cucumber, crab, and seaweed salad that tasted as good as it looked.  All sushi and sashimi that we chose happened to be half off, and I felt that even at the full price would have been well worth it.  Presentation for everything that we ordered was amazing, and once again tasted every bit as good as it appeared on the plate!  I will definitely be back any time I am in the city!"}
{"text":"I will start out by saying that I REALLY wanted to like this place which is located in one of the Burgh's fun date areas.  The inside is really pretty, colorful, clean and the ambiance is cool.  Weird thing is that this place was empty...like no one was in there.  I know it's Sunday but folks still eat on Sundays and the other restaurants in the area were full.  

The host was very nice and grabbed my order pretty quickly.  We ordered an uninteresting sushi roll and the chicken soba noodles.  The soba was good and had the nice crunch to the vegetables.  I honestly don't remember the name of the sushi but it had no flavor.  So much so, I can't even tell what was in it besides the avocado and rice.  Anyway, I may give this place another go and eat in to sample some of the other dishes and see how service is like.  I can't say that I will go out of my way to visit though.  With the Cheesecake Factory, McCormick and that Mongolian grille nearby...there's some pretty tough competition and I'm not sure they are worthy of me passing by those places just yet."}
{"text":"I love this place. I usually get salmon which comes with veggies, fried rice, and a couple pieces of shrimp. It's the perfect meal for me and it's delicious! The soup and salad is even great. I've had a few different sushi rolls as well, and I love them. All in all, I love the food."}
{"text":"I first off want to say I am by far the easiest customer to please- I eat anything. Me and my 3 friends went out to eat here just tonight for my friends birthday. To say the least, this is by far the WORST experience I have ever had at a restaurant. 

I, along with three of my friends, got the Chicken tepanyaki. The rice was unbelievably bland and mushy. The chicken was so chewy it was hard to even take more than a bite. The vegetables WERENT terrible, but that's me trying to add a positive. The shrimp sauce... don't get me started. It was chunky and just didn't even taste sanitary. 

We had notified the manager, and he was invasive and didn't handle the situation well at all. He was interrogating us why we didn't like it, and then took our plates back to be examined!!! For a CHAIN restaurant he was very selfish about our simple request to have our meals taken off. We even offered to pay for our drinks. He tried giving us 25% off and even had printed the bills and tried making us pay with about a $5 discount. Needless to say, the food flat out sucks and the manager needs an attitude and customer service adjustment. Im disgusted and my stomach is in agreence. Take your business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Best Sushi bar in Pittsburgh, that's why we keep coming back...!

Had dinner here last night to get my 'sushi-fix' and again wasn't disappointed.  Our fav sushi guy- Lee had moved back to New York but Lin was there to pick up where Lee left off.  The sushi was the freshest I've tasted here in Pgh and Lin served us a complimentary 'Sexy Salmon' plate of 4 Sashimi's even before the ice water hit the counter in front of us.  Service can be slow here but don't let that keep you away.  Sit at the sushi counter and enjoy the show of countless rolls getting perfectly created right there in front of you.  We ordered 2 bowls of Miso soup ($1 on Sun & Mon) which were delicious.  The tofu was cut in tiny cubes so you could get some with every spoonful.  
We then ordered an Octopus Salad ($5), a regular Tuna Roll ($3), a regular Philadelphia Roll ($3) and a specialty Eel Dragon Roll ($7.5).  The Octopus Salad was as good as I had tasted anywhere.  Places use this to garnish sushi platters and I was hooked after the first time I decided to taste it.  It has the consistency of bacon and a sweet/tartiness that can't be described.  Simply put... YUMM!
Our sushi rolls were up next and if you look at the picture- the presentation was excellent.  The Eel Dragon Roll had so many tastes & textures going on, it was simply amazing- the sweetness and slight warmth of baked eel, the creaminess & cooling effect of the avocado, the perfect stickiness of the rice...  
As we were slowly finishing this off- Lee offers 4 complimentary baked teriyaki shrimp that I think he was trying out to put on the menu.  Sweet & warm then the wasabi I dipped it in hit my taste buds and Wow...!  
Requesting our tab- we were shocked...  $23...!  Was this McDonalds?  No...!  This was hand made, right in front of us, ultra fresh sushi.  
You keep rollin them up, we'll keep coming back...!"}
{"text":"This sushi is great for the Pittsburgh area. Awesome rolls, fish is fresh and I've only ever had a pleasant experience. It's not superior quality but definitely one of the best options of the south side, shady side Oakland area. The lunch combo options also come with large portions."}
{"text":"Apparently this restaurant just opened in April and the advertising hasn't been the greatest.  They have a prime location,  however they are competing with some heavy hitters (i.e. Cheesecake Factory,  Hofbrahaus, and McCormick and Schmick's). Their happy hour is phenomenal,  the sushi is superb. I got the Sake Monster Roll which comes with 8 pieces.  All chef specialty rolls are 8 pieces.  As a snack/free appetizer,  they supply won tons and sweet and sour sauce (which I believe has mango in it). Our waitress Kayla was great. We were her only table for awhile but she gave just enough attention. They also have salsa night on Saturdays.  If you're looking for a great atmosphere, quality food,  and great service then come and check out Sake!"}
{"text":"I went to Pittsburgh while I was home visiting my family in Akron, Oh. We drove to Pittsburgh to visit my grandma who has been alive longer than most trilobites. So when she finally went to bed at 5:30, my mom, dad, sister and I decided to get some dinner and drinks.

We walked in the door, about faced and marched right out. This hip and elegant sushi restaurant was clearly way out of our modest price range. But, I thought to myself, \"hold up Jake, why not just hop on the ole' Yelp and check out that menu!\" Glad I did because it turns out that this restaurant is totally affordable.

So we grabbed a table outside since it was a nice, temperate pittsburgh summer night and I don't get much of that in the sweltering sticky sauna of summer in South Florida - how about that alliteration suckas!

So we got 6 rolls to share, the large order of saki which my dad and I split while my mom and sister got some peach lemonade vodka bullshit (not really my bag). Now let me say, I don't do cheap sushi or even affordable sushi after the all you can eat sushi buffet fiasco of 2012. Let me tell you, this sushi is not only safe to eat but delicious as well. That sushi was gone in the blink of an eye. I wish that this place was in Ft. Lauderdale because it would become a Sunkin Staple. 

Only one downside, the waiter was a little awkward. But we didn't really mind. How often can you find great affordable sushi with such a nice atmosphere? 

Bottom line: perfect sushi place for a baller on a budget."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Pittsburgh! Very clean, modern atmosphere, attentive staff, and quality food.  I've eaten sushi all over the city, but Sake has constantly impressed me with both the freshness of the fish and the creativity of its presentation. Average prices for an above average experience. They have half price sushi on Mondays, so I dine here basically every Monday. I recommend this restaurant to anyone who likes Asian cuisine and especially those who like sushi. MUST TRY THE SIGNATURE ROLL. AMAZING."}
{"text":"I went for the half price sushi night.  It was good.  There really wasn't anything remarkable about the place.  The sushi was good, but not great.  The presentation was nice. The service was good.

I wouldn't go out of my way to go here, but if I were in the Southside Works and wanted sushi, I'd return."}
{"text":"Good sushi.great service.always checking on us.      Refilling glasses and always with a smile.    My husband
Had the sushi that looked good
. I had the hibachi shrimp and steak .there was so much food. I could not finish it.had to bring it home'.                                                Overall a very good experience .will be back'
."}
{"text":"welcome to sushi bar try best sushi in pittsburgh .chef james as guest in sake.
come to try his omakase sushi."}
{"text":"Ordered from GrubHub so I don't have an experience with the restaurant, just with the food. I ordered the coconut shrimp and the gyoza. Gyoza was pretty good, I'd get it again. The coconut shrimp, however, was so gross I couldn't even eat it. They clearly did NOT devein it before serving because there was a big ole chunk of shrimp poop in 3 out of 5 of the incredibly small shrimps that cost me 8 DOLLARS. Pretty unbelievable if ya ask me."}
{"text":"I stopped at Sake because I had arrived early for a movie right around the corner.  Saw the half price sush/$5 martini sign and couldn't resist!  When I came in, I was immediately impressed by the atmosphere/decor, and the happy hour menu is wonderful with tons of choices.

Food and service were both WAY above expectations- excellent in all respects!  The spicy tuna roll/individual pieces of sush I ordered (including bbq eel and squid) were absolutely outstanding- super fresh and uniformly delicious.  All of the choices were very reasonable- the happy hour is a phenomenal value.  Great melon martini too!  A friend joined me who is on a very restricted diet, and was allowed to eat her snack at the table in addition to sharing some sushi.  We really appreciated their accommodation.

Our waiter John was incredible- super helpful, nice, responsive, easy to talk to, etc. etc.  Couldn't ask for better service!   Some things took awhile to arrive, expected given the labor intensive nature of sushi-t John was super proactive and brought the check, etc. ahead of time so I'd make it to the movie on time!

Overall a perfect experience- I'll definitely be bringing friends back here soon.  Can't believe I hadn't tried it before.  I'm planning to sit at the sushi counter next time.

Really can't imagine why anyone would be disappointed in this place- obviously some folks felt haven't had great experiences, but mine was absolutely perfect!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time recently and was very impressed.  With all of the hibachi/sushi places in the area Sake gets overlooked.  However, they have some of the best sushi I have ever had, and definitely my favorite in Pittsburgh.

I had the monster roll, millennium roll, and yellowtail.  Each of them were incredibly fresh and tasted delicious.  They have a deal where the sushi is half off during certain times which made the meal very reasonably priced.  My wife ordered the chicken and shrimp hibachi dinner which was also very good.

For both the price and quality this is a great spot for sushi and hibachi.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The Best and completed Menu I have had in several years in the Asian industry for Pittsburgh, just overall different with a wealth of expertise and decor - I want to say they are the best overall with food, location, variety/ different and decor that just adds up to perfection, it's a shame that poor advertisement and cost of operations typically dooms places like this but we'll keep and eye on them to see if the quality dips."}
{"text":"Seriously awful. The wait staff seriously doesn't know what they are doing. There is a reason this place is always empty. There is a reason that they need to use Groupon. It was very unnecessarily dark. The sushi rolls tasted very heavily fishy which means that the quality of the fish is very poor or it is not well kept. The tepenyaki chicken was rubbery and tasted mildly of soy sauce. At least the salad and friend rice were acceptable."}
{"text":"Absolutely awful experience. I came here last night for my birthday, I made a reservation for 7. When we arrived the hostess, who we later found out was the general manager, refused to seat us until the majority of my party arrived. Majority arrived and he now claimed he could not seat us until my entire party had arrived. My sister asked why and he became extremely ignorant and got in a screaming battle in the middle of the restaurant with her. AWFUL management and the service is not far behind. It took 10 minutes for waters, probably about another 20 minutes for our cocktails. When our food was done we first received the wrong order which they took back and then served to someone else. They also had at least a 5 minute time gap between when each of us got our meals. Save your time and money and go elsewhere. Absolutely awful experience."}
{"text":"If you like sushi stop reading this review, order yours and enjoy. Don't bother with anything else. 


Ugh. I feel really bad for this place. The restaurants in the southside works area always have such a hard time and I really wanted to like this place. 

If you need to put advertisements in your window for 50 off your meals then you know the business is struggling. Your food should sell on merit alone and not have to gimmick customers into showing up. 

When we arrived at 7 on a Wednesday night there were maybe 2 other people in the entire establishment. I joked if there was a wait to the hostess at the front was not having any of it. 

We ordered house wine $6.50 for barefoot. Pricey but whatever. Then the waiter started chatting with another table while we waited for a couple minutes. When he came over we ordered our food. He brought out our soup and salads immediately but didn't have any miso soup ready so I had to wait. Not a big deal. 

He cleaned up and when he brought out our sushi appetizer (red lobster roll) it was delicious. Nice presentation and good taste. 

When the main meal came out pork katsu and chicken tepanyaki it wasn't even warm! It was room temperature. We couldn't find the waiter so we just sat and waited. Finally when he returned we asked for it to be reheated. He came back within a couple of minutes with the same food on a different plate! Food was still cold. We got outta there. 

I would recommend this for sushi. Stay away from the other food. It just isn't that good to be honest. They are trying to hard to do Korean, Japanese and Thai all at once. Stick with the Japanese which is what they accel at. I hear the bartender is pretty badass so we will have to stop by for a drink before we go to the movies."}
{"text":"I've been here for lunch, which was great and had good deals. However, I went there tonight for happy hour, which according to their website is half off of appetizers from 5-7. But according to our waiter, the only appetizers that are half off are the ones that are are on the menu as 50% off all day. So, there isn't a happy hour at all. It is just the same price all day on Thursdays. Too bad if you're vegetarian or don't like sushi...so go somewhere else unless you're all about cheap sushi."}
{"text":"Sake's pretty good for their sushi specials that run on the less busy days Sunday-Thursday.  You can get your basic rolls for a fairly inexpensive price.  However, when it comes to specialty rolls nothing really stands out.

Otherwise, the service is usually pretty decent.  It's nice to have somewhere to go after seeing a movie at Southside Cinema."}
{"text":"Came in Saturday afternoon and was confused by how few people were in this joint. I took several steps inside, honestly not sure if they perhaps closed between lunch and dinner, and no one immediately stepped forward to seat me. I finally caught someone's eye and just asked to sit at the sushi bar, as that was all I was interested in trying. The sushi chefs were very nice and the food was surprisingly cheap. My waitress seemed to forget about me at some points, but would check on me every so often. The sushi was good. Better than average in Pittsburgh. The presentation was very nice. I ordered a volcano roll and squid and hokkigai sashimi. They were both excellent and very flavorful."}
{"text":"We stopped by before the dinner crowd came in. We had been at a funeral and I was walking my dog, hungry having missed lunch. I knocked on the door just to ask for a menu. The manager, Tom, allowing me to bring my dog into the waiting area so i could sit down and give him my order. He even went back to the kitchen and came back to give my dog a treat. He told me i could expect the food in 20 minutes, allowing me time to walk the dog. When i returned there was a package waiting. When I  took it back to our hotel , my wife and I were delighted with our dinner. Delicious miso soup, perfectly crisp lettuce salad, spicy tuna and sweet potato rolls, my wife had salmon exactly as I ordered, grilled with no sauces. I had the Thai mango chicken. All delicious.
Price was reasonable."}
{"text":"Great drink specials.. A male bartender with flannel draped in suspenders.. And a female bartender who will melt your heart with her soft spoken personality along with aggressively potent physical beauty ~ made this dining experience better than most sexperiences I've had in the past 8 months. Nice work sake. We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. I ordered the spicy Cali roll and spring crabmeat. Excellent. The service and drinks were pretty awful. Our server was very rude and inattentive. Coming from a fellow server, I was really thrown off by the server's unwillingness to even acknowledge us when we asked for help. He was very rude and matter-of-fact about splitting our check after we ate but there was no sign or verbal warning that checks can't be split. 
Other than that, the food truly was delicious and low cost. Can't say I'll be back because I don't live in the area but I do wish my local sushi places were priced like this Sake."}
{"text":"Today is Mother's Day sushi outing to try Sake--a newly opened sushi restaurant. 
The hubs and I were greeted by a very polite and well dressed man who seated us near the window at a tableclothed two top adorned with a pair of wine glasses and neatly folded cloth napkins. A view of the dining room showed a uniformed display of white with a subtle touch of olive green in front of a backdrop of textured walls reaching the high ceiling. Very clean and symmetrical. Will have to bring hubs to dinner to experience the nighttime ambiance.  
Our waiter greeted us promptly and took our order which was probably enough to feed a third person but upon arrival, the table next to us was being served sushi for 2 on an enormous platter--how can we resist? Yes, please! And while we're waiting, we'll have an order of shrimp tempura! And sake for the mom since that was the reason we came here. 
A small, no frills iceberg lettuce salad topped with ginger dressing and a delicious white miso soup arrived at our table which balanced our tempura appetizer.  
Our sushi for 2 arrived quickly followed by a pair of 'ooohhhs & aaaahhhs' as we gazed at the platter with an appreciation that SAKE has a few well trained sushi chefs! Score one for the Southside works! 
Sushi rice was seasoned perfectly--not too cold and whole rice grains stuck together nicely without being glutinous.  Fish slices cut diagonally in the correct thickness and length. Taco (Octopus) was tender enough to bite thru. A delightful feast to the eyes. 
A truly delicious fare for our full tummies as we finished the last few bites. 
*sigh* would have loved to partake in Sake's desserts but sadly, our eyes were larger than our stomachs. Will have to keep this in mind for our next visit!

{"text":"50% off sushi Sunday through Thursday...which sounds great but there might be a reason they need to incentivize customers to show up at their place. 

SAKE looks nice on the outside, is situated near the southside waterfront area, a beautiful place that features shops and other nice restaurants like the Cheesecake Factory. Upon entering the restaurant, you notice that it's dark. And when I say dark, I mean I couldn't even read the menu (thank you phone flashlight). I get it, it's nice to have the mellow ambiance, but I'm not here for a club ya feel. If they want to keep this style, I feel like maybe booths could be darker and the bar could be darker, but everywhere else should be at least light enough to see the menu. 

Besides the ambiance, I thought the food was average. Sushi menu offers lots of options, but I wasn't particularly impressed with the meat. The tuna tasted frozen, the salmon a bit old, and everything was just really mushy. It didn't have the clean feel and texture that good sushi has. I also got a shrimp tempura ramen that I thought didn't exactly cut it. The soup was very underflavored, and the big bowl (which looked good) was littered with a bunch of useless vegetables that got in the way of me eating instead of adding any flavor or something I wanted to eat. Also, the shrimp tempura was accompanied with a motley of random veggies like onion and okra that I honestly felt like was misplaced. Just keep it simple and serve just shrimp as advertised.

The place is losing customers, and I can see why---food is not that impressive, ambiance is not comfortable, and their execution is really lacking."}
{"text":"Very similar to a sushi restaurant that I always frequented back at home. I recommend it. It's pretty straight forward- good sushi, good prices. I recommend heading there on a Sunday or Monday when they're doing half-off sushi. Prices vary between $3 and $7.50 on those days. 

Didn't have the hibachi but will definitely be heading back there to try that out."}
{"text":"This is a great place! I'll start with the con. It was a little bit of a wait for our food (30 min, and it's not crowded at all) but that's it.   It wasn't too crowded, so 30 minutes turned into 15. My bowl was massive for the Nabe Yaki Udon, and there was a ton of soup. Actually, everyone at the table got a salad and miso soup for an appetizer. Nice! Lots of food, decent prices (mine was $15, not too bad for a huge bowl) and everyone probably paid less than $20 for their meals. I'm probably gonna come here for my birthday, quite excited! This is a decent place, and they also seated us in less time than we thought. Lighting is nice, romantic and great for a date, but still fine with groups. Not really a kids' place unless they're older. But great atmosphere! I haven't tried the sushi, so I need to do that. Great place on a Saturday night, plus there's a bar."}
{"text":"sushi was AMAZING. best sushi I've ever head. service as on point, they were there when we needed stuff and went out of their way to find us a bottle that they thought they were out of! I highly recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Good quick sushi dinner before a night of foot massages.  Special scallops were tasty. Rolls etc. were nothing  special."}
{"text":"Had chicken teriyaki for takeout. It was dinner combo with fried rice and steamed vegetables. The chicken was fully cooked and juicy. However it wasn't grilled or sautéed. The color and texture tasted like it was steamed. To me that ruined the flavor (along with the fact there wasn't a dose of seasoning whatsoever). The fried rice was average."}
{"text":"This is the place to go if you like rolls--all types.  I got a veggie roll plate. But the rolls I got in the side were absolutely delicious.  They were the avocado peanut rolls.  
   There is not a lot of variety if you are vegetarian or vegan other than the two selections I mentioned above. They also have a plain avocado roll and maybe about 5 veggie rolls. 
       This seems to be a mostly Japanese style Asian restaurant.  They had soba noodles and teriyaki. This is what my husband ordered.  They also serve authentic green tea.  The service is excellent. The ambience is beautiful.   
    Loved it!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Their sushi is half off on weekdays, and that is amazing. Their sushi roll selections are amazing. My favorites are the sweet potato veggie sushi and the spicy salmon for the non veg sushi. Their entrees are amazing but too. Anything from the teppanyaki section is simply amazing."}
{"text":"This place has a really nice feel to it when you walk in. There were three of us and it was around 4pm so the place wasn't too busy at the time. We had pretty quick service at the beginning. We all had gotten the salad with the normal ginger dressing. It was actually really good and a little more creamy and had, I think, different seasonings than regular ginger dressing that always comes on salad at sushi places everywhere. I got the Mexican roll that came in a group of 6. I came with two guys so they ordered quite a few different sushi rolls. I believe one was the dragon roll which tasted delicious. I really liked my Mexican roll and the presentation for all three of our plates was beautiful. However, after we finished the service was beyond slow. It looked like other tables servers were faster, but honestly it took more than 5-10 minutes for the server to come over after we all were finished and just sitting there. Then it took another 5-10 to just bring our checks back. I really was going to give this place three stars because of the slow service, but I don't want another place to go out of business in this building. I will give them a second chance."}
{"text":"The food tasted awesome and was done quickly. The place is neat and clean. There's a good deal on groupon for this place, so check it out"}
{"text":"Given that I was just in Tokyo and this is my first sushi meal back in the states - SAKE didn't stand much of a chance. 

I sat at the sushi bar and found a very young chef with little to no personality. I tried to dig a little to find out what was fresh but this conversation didn't get far. 

As for the sushi - not bad for US standards. Was the tuna melt in your mouth fresh.... Well since I ordered from the 50% off menu I wasn't holding out much hope. SAKE should concentrate on the food and less of the ambiance they are trying to put together. 

Tuna and Salmon lakes taste in sushi form so I would go with them in roll form. 

A good happy hour spot - yes. 
Flying tuna in from the West Coast....."}
{"text":"Awful!  Where to begin?  The food is served on plastic plates and bowls with the name of another restaurant on them.  The selection is meager unless you want sushi.  The appetizers are on the last page of the menu.  The food was bland and comparable to food you would get at a take-out Chinese place with photos of dishes above the counter.  Service was slow.  The manager walked around the dining area but did not ask anyone about their meal; but he did stop to blow his nose in the middle of the dining area."}
{"text":"Cooper is going to be my new favorite bartender in town. The sushi is really good, I would say better than other places in town.

There is one downfall: the manager of the restaurant spends most of his time walking around micromanaging and berating his workers, which is not cool! If you go, you won't be disappointed, but be sure to tell the little twerp manager to stop giving his staff such a hard time. That would be the only reason why I never go back."}
{"text":"Out of every sushi place I've been to in Pittsburgh (and I've literally been to every one), I would say this place has the best sushi (as far as sashimi goes), hands down. Considering that Pittsburgh has the worst sushi I've ever had, I don't know if this review is as good as you think it is. lol

Also, don't ever show up to this place exactly at the time it opens. Show up about 20 minutes after it opens. It's weird, but a couple of times, they have asked me to leave and come back because \"they weren't ready yet.\""}
{"text":"The tuna and salmon rolls were very bad. The fish was literally ground to a pulp and had an extremely unenjoyable texture. It is almost as if someone took leftover fish trimmings and put them through a meat grinder. When I told the manager, he said they were very popular. I had to ask to have them removed from the bill.

Look up tuna scrape. This is what they serve, and its gross."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I dined here on a Thursday night and it was empty! The service was very speedy.  We were immediately served crackers with sweet and sour sauce. We ordered the cooked sushi dish and the soft-shelled crab tempura dish to share.  It worked well in having some variety.  Each dish came with a soup and salad.  I really enjoyed the salad and its ginger dressing!  I didn't really care for the soup, but my boyfriend really liked it so he ate both of our soups.  The soup had a strange earthy flavor.  We enjoyed both of our dishes, and we ordered a bottle of sake to try.  It was very different and delicious, but I would warn people looking to try it that it's tiny! We saw $18/bottle and expected an average bottle of wine, but it was actually the size of a beer.  The prices, otherwise, were very reasonable.  The atmosphere is also interesting to note.  It has many bright colored lights and reminds me of a nightclub.  I had a groupon so I could not take advantage of their specially priced menu, but Sunday through Thursday they have VERY cheap prices on their menu.  I would recommend trying it on one of those nights."}
{"text":"Very Poor management, which was arrogant, rude and no business skills. He spent the whole time walking around staring at people. This may be the reason that less then 10 people where there on a Friday night. The sushi was over price and not on the same level as the other two sushi places on the South Side. Heck you could get comparable sushi at the Giant Eagle down the street. The bartenders were great but very hampered by the overprice and the poor management.

Do yourself a favor and try somewhere else."}
{"text":"Just paid way too much for what was supposed to be Thai mango curry.
Tasted like fried onion in bad gravy . Live local and was my first and last visit. Very poor Thai food. Disgusting fried rice. Easy to see why the place was empty on a Saturday evening"}
{"text":"I ordered the coconut shrimp and they were so small and overcooked. I was not impressed. I also had the spring rolls and they were decent, nothing special. I will probably order take out here again since I work across the street but definitely order something different. The restaurant is pretty big and looks like a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Would not recommend anyone EVER come here. I have lived in Pittsburgh for 23 years and have never had such a horrible experience at a restaurant.

First of all, the options are extremely limited unless you're getting sushi or rolls. I ended up ordering the chicken teriyaki, and asked our waiter to have it made as a spicy dish, and he said there would be no problem. About 30 minutes later, he came over to tell me that they refused to make the dish as a spicy dish and that they told him to bring me out Sriracha. When I did receive the discolored chicken with the teriyaki sauce on the side, my boyfriend took a bite first and figured it was just a bad piece because it tasted like cartilage entirely. When I bit into the raw/undercooked, possibly re-cooked chicken, it was unbelievably disgusting. I had it taken back and our waiter told us he tried it, and the cooks tried it, and they just \"didn't know what was wrong with it\". After losing my appetite, we asked for the bill and he returned with wrong charges on it...my happy hour drink charged as double what it was, at full price. After taking a few minutes to fix this, he returned and I gave him my Groupon and he was \"unsure\" as to whether I could use it or not because the purchase of two entrees is a requirement (perhaps he had forgotten that we had TRIED to purchase two entrees, unfortunately, due to the disgusting \"food\", we were unable to have such). 

Finally, after waiting even longer for this to be resolved, we ended up leaving in fear that we would become sick from the awful \"food\" I was served. Also, not once did management apologize for any of the events that occurred, nor did they attempt to make up for the situation in any way. TERRIBLE experience, I truly do not recommend anyone ever giving them a dime!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why the rating isn't that high. I go there pretty often and they never failed to satisfy me  I brought different friends here and they all seem to enjoy it as well. I love all their sushi and their terriyaki chicken is pretty delicious as well. Costumer service is always excellent!"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars, I would. The sushi was cut too thick and smelled like bleach. I had to get up three times to get the attention of server. The bar could not make a drink to save their life and sent the wrong bottle of wine. They overcharged us and fought us about the bill. I will never be back and suggest you don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Great deals on very good sushi Sunday through Thursday. This is as good as any in Pittsburgh and if you come during the specials it is very satisfying!"}
