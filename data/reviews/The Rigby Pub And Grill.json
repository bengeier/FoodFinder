{"text":"A short update to my last review.  The Rigby now has 14 taps on the main floor.  Thanks for listening an adding the 6 additional taps Rigby management."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful experience at The Rigby. I had the sliders, and they are AMAZING! I hate coleslaw. The pork sliders came with slaw on them and they were incredible. My server was incredibly polite and attentive. I loved the food, had fantastic service, and the drink specials were awesome. I had a great time, and it was amazing. I will definitely be back. Also, the cheese curds? Best in Madison. Absolutely incredible!"}
{"text":"You can't order as bad meal here! Menu is well formed making it easy to pick just what you're in the mood for - lots of choices, but not so many that you get confused. Service is top notch and very friendly. Careful of the baked goods - very addicting! :-)  Beatles atmosphere is awesome!!"}
{"text":"Lies.   Website says kitchen is open until 2am. It's not. Wes here at midnight and there's no food."}
{"text":"I totally happened upon this place by coincidence and ended up grabbing a bite to eat while waiting for some folks on a busy Friday night. I have to say I was quite impressed. The Cuban sandwich was a real treat, and I was so happy to see Purple Haze on tap. I have already visited again and brought a few people with me. Another recommendation would be their house breaded chicken wings, bone-in and boneless were both REALLY good - and if you go during there \"hippy hour\" I think from 3-5 they are only 25 cents a pop! Not sure why this place seems to be pretty quiet while the rest of the establishments on the street are packed. This really is a gem worth checking out!"}
{"text":"The Rigby.   I take that it's named after Eleanor Rigby of Beatles fame. Cool. I don't mind a themed bar, and I'm surprised that it's taken me five years in Madison to make it to this place. What drove me was the promise of league trivia and air conditioning in the dog days of summer. Other joints along the square, and along this road, are all pretty good--Sushi Red, Maduro Cigar Bar, etc. So why not?   This was not good. Got in, and the first thing that hits you is the smell. It's musty...almost bathroom like, but with a slight hint of the cigar bar next door. Think: leaning over to smell a urinal cake with a cigarette butt left in it. Also, every surface is kind of sticky; I'm not saying the barbacks weren't clean--I saw them constantly cleaning and putting things away (good on them); but get a dehumidifier or something.   Special of the night was Mexican fare--a margarita special and taco plate. Which is cool--but in a Beatles / Rock and Roll themed place? Whatever, I'm not that picky, and I ordered both. Margs were good, and the first bartender was nice and attentive. Tacos, not so much, but probably worth it for $3. Are we angling for a college crowd here? On the other side of the square??? Maybe not the market.  Before that, I got an app of Pretzel bites. They were okay at best. The dipping sauces were alright, except for the queso--my girlfriend was adamant that I not even try it. Confounding, though, was that the server was bragging that they make their own dipping sauces. Really? You make your own mustard and queso? Cause that tasted like some gas station nacho stuff right there. Either you're lying, or up the game.   Next bartender was less impressive. Probably on some pharms, but who isn't these days? Crowd got a bit sketch as well; some super drunk guy came in and actually got beer, and then belched and tried talking to me for a while. Pretty slow for a Tuesday night, but it's Tuesday.   Trivia wasn't great either, fyi.   This is an odd building, and an odd location. I love a good dive bar, but there's a lot off about this place. I think it's suffering from an identity crisis. I don't mind a rock and roll theme, but be consistent. They seemed to have infused a hell of a lot of alcohol, but that's not being made a selling point--it's just blandly listed on a blackboard above the bar. What is it? Mexican night combined with infused spirits mixed with rock and roll themes in a musty, slightly unclean environment? Confusing and not up to Madison off-the-square standards. I hope they up their game."}
{"text":"Famous for cheese curds, I got lucky with the lobster filled cheese curds!! Also had Wisconsin mc n cheese with buffalo chicken.   Great music selection and service"}
{"text":"I've read in previous posts that the service and food were subpar. That is NOT the case. Our service was impeccable, and our waitress extremely attentive. The food is pretty top notch pub/bar food, and the music is even better. Give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"Good prices and good service. The music is crazy loud tho. My ears hurt. With so many other bars around I would check them out before subjecting my ear drums to the punishment. It was very difficult to hold conversations. This place is 2.5 stars and would be 3.5 stars if not for the music."}
{"text":"Ugh Riiiiiiigby. I love you. And I want to keep loving you, but your service has gotten atrocious."}
{"text":"Cool theme. Curious to see if this place stays quiet or explodes in popularity. It could do either with the whole beatles/classic rock niche. Very excited to see some shows in \"the cavern\", their dark and dusty brick basement. Kind of creepy looking but its an awesome venue to see some music. They havnt had any shows yet. Tried the Rigby burger, which was ok. The meat/toppings wasn't hugge by any means but the kaiser roll it was on was the size of a football. A little too much bread IMO. The sides were the highlight in my opinion. I don't like super tangy coleslaw and theirs was nice and creamy with a touch of twang. Overall, a cool place with a decent beer selection and cheap, solid food. Its a nice addition to Madison's dynamic bar scene. Ill return to catch a show sometime."}
{"text":"Great place for a stiff cocktail.  The gummy bears are no joke.  GREAT music every time."}
{"text":"I love the staff! I have only been here a few times and they remember my order! Wednesday nights, Tyler is in charge and he is great! Good happy hour specials too"}
{"text":"I was introduced to the Rigby when I joined friends for Tuesday Trivia. All in all a fun time and so when we wanted to stop and have a beer and quick bite we went back. The staff was great and friendly.  They had a selection of (3) 2 fer 1 pitchers. The beers selected for the special seemed a bit odd (Goze, Sour Apple and a dark heavy beer) so we skipped the special and bought a regular pitcher ... for $18. Pretty pricey when we went in expecting to grab a quick 2 Fer.  I've heard nothing but good things about the sandwiches but the special was a flatbread so we decided on that, Very disappointing. About the size of a small personal pizza and uninspired ... on par with a take and bake pizza only smaller with less toppings.  Really wanted to like this more but would wander to the next open door and try a new place before going back to Rigby."}
{"text":"This was the first restaurant/pub I visited when I moved to Madison last October, and it quickly became a favorite. Most of the food is great - I'd highly recommend the burgers (I like the Here Comes the Sun burger with the fried egg on top), the turkey club wrap and ANY of the soups.  The chefs are talented and creative;  try one of their daily specials some time.  The mac and cheese is a favorite.  They also have fabulous fresh-baked goods (best strawberry scones I've ever had.)  OK, I started with the food, but the real draw here is the atmosphere, which is a great blend of two elements; the tasteful Beatles decor and the friendly staff. My particular favorite is the giant retro album mosaic, including both classics (eponymous Led Zeppelin) and rarities (yeah, my mind just drew a blank). Don't expect All Beatles All The Time;  I doubt anyone can survive that narrow niche - but the music is fun and eclectic.  There is a large upstairs which frequently hosts talent;  some of my favorites over the last year have been The Dirty Pigeons, Colorphase, Misery Jackals and Under the Willow.   Tuesday night trivia is a must;  Kim is a character;  a latter-day Betty Boop with attitude.   Tap beers are limited, but they are switched up frequently, so there's always something new to try. Someone said the Gummy Bears were no joke - I would have to second that.   I should mention I'm 50.  The weekend late-night crowd makes me feel like a relic, but any other time there is a wide variety of ages in both regulars (like me) and newcomers.  But whoever you are, I guarantee you will feel welcome."}
{"text":"The only thing I can complain about is the pretzel bits, don't get those. Otherwise, this bar is perfect. It is comfortable, it is welcoming and it is fun. Other places in the area are packed but this place it seems there is always a place at the bar, and not because the place is bad, but because it is a place for the local people to come and escape only for a moment. Escape the rush and responsibility of the day and have a drink with good people and not be judged for it. Cheers."}
{"text":"I was getting things done at the GEF building, needed a snack and a drink, I can't believe how many restaurants are with in walking distance. Herd about the Rigby and decided to stop in . A very relaxing small place. They had Led Zep and Jimi Hendrix playing,not some kind of weird stuff! With all of the cheese curds in the Madison area to rate these were some of the best! With a tasty dipping sauce and half price yelp check in for apps. As arnold would say I'll be back."}
{"text":"The Rigby is a fun bar just off the Capitol Square.  It is unpretentious and has some pretty good food and solid tap list.  Try the Sergeant Popper Burger, a burger with cream cheese and jalapeno peppers.  It is a theme bar, which I usually don not go for, but The Rigby makes it work.  In case you couldn't tell by the name, the theme is rock and roll with a big Beatles influence.  A big draw here is Team Trivia on Tuesdays at 7PM.  Prizes are awarded for 1st through 3rd place and for best team name.  Win or loose it is always a good time.  The waitstaff is rock solid.   With good food, a solid tap list, friendly staff, good friends, and trivia, this place has become a weekly staple."}
{"text":"Discovered Rigby at the Taste of Madison and absolutely loved their food and wanted to see what else they had to offer.  Came in and service was not good, waitress seemed to be bothered by our simple questions. Ordered a Ginger Ale for $2.50, was given a can of Wal-Mart Great Value ginger ale...I'm sure a 24 pack of that doesn't even cost that...atleast put it in a glass so I don't know what it is, it tasted cheap cause it is cheap. Food was very disappointing and wasn't even seasoned with salt, very bland.   Disappointing service, disappointing food, will not go back."}
{"text":"We've been here twice in the past few months, both times sitting outside in the afternoon.    The beer and drinks have been above average.  Beer selection great, and drink menu good enough to satisfy any taste.   The food s really good.  We got the chicken and waffle fries appetizer twice - the seasoned chicken is awesome and the \"waffle fries\" are more like hand-cut slices of potato cooked to perfection...really good.   We also had the Shrimp Po Boy and a buffalo chicken wrap.  Both excellent, far better than expected.    Service both times was good also.  Can't wait to continue to explore the menu, with an order of the chicken ansd waffle fries of course! :-)"}
{"text":"IOWA Alum - this is your place for the game! I saw the disastrous Rose Bowl here but the excellent bloody mary and cheese curds kept me from walking out. The second floor was a perfect place to watch the game with other Iowa fans.  The second time I came here, the curds were not quite as great as I had remembered. I really like the buffalo ranch sauce, though.   I would give this place 3.5 stars. The drinks are reasonably priced. The music was a little loud last time. It's a smaller bar if the second floor isn't open. I would recommend checking this place out if you're looking for a laid back bar with decent food near the square."}
{"text":"7/20/13 My wife and I biked downtown and came across The Rigby.  We had no idea it had been open since 2011.  Awesome 70's music was playing.  The bar is tastefully decorated with music memorabilia.  I really enjoyed looking at the framed album covers.  My wife thought it had a Chicago vibe.  They had $2.50 Edmund Fitzgerald's from Great Lakes Brewing Co for a special.  Their spinach dip with veggies, crackers, and tortillas chips was tasty.   The bartender was very pleasant and welcoming."}
{"text":"A friend and I tried the Rigby Pub and Grill for lunch yesterday. I really liked it. They have outdoor seating and we were going to ask to be sat outside, but once inside we realized the only one working tables was the bartender, so we decided to just eat at the bar. The bartender provided us menus, asked if we had seen the special (it varies based on the day of the week) and took our drink order. The menu contained appetizers, sandwiches, burgers, and wraps. I appreciated that there were both yellow and white cheese curds, and less common items like stuffed mushroom curds and taco curd.  In addition to the outdoor seating, and the room on the main floor with the bar, there were stairs heading both downstairs and upstairs. We didn't check out either but it appears there may be additional seating. Everything we saw appeared clean, well-kept, and was comfortable.  We ended up ordering the Grilled Summer Sausage w/house-made chips w/French Onion Dip, and a burger with Beer Battered Onion Rings. The Grilled Summer Sausage was great. Served on rye bread with cheese and mustard. I've never seen that on a menu before, but it was delicious. The chips weren't super crisp but with the dip they were very tasty. The onion rings were just how I like them. Super crispy, more breading than onion. I look forward to trying some of their other options such as the curds, the pickle chips and the Cuban.  One of the best parts of our experience was when the bartender came over and was explaining the concept of the Rigby. Beatles themed, local ingredients, they flavor their own liquors. His pride in what the Rigby does was well-deserved.   I definitely recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"I'm pretty \"meh\" on the food here. The reason I wanted to visit was mostly for the Beatles memorabilia they have displayed as I am a huge Beatles fan.  I came with a group of five and the dishes ordered included a cuban, strogonoff, the rigby burger, and I don't remember the others. Nothing particularly stood out, yet nothing was bad. Everything was fine but nothing I would recommend as a first choice.   I would come back for the drinks and atmosphere but not the food."}
{"text":"I ate here with a friend for lunch to try something new.  The menu was not all that exciting, but had all your basics - sandwiches, salads, burgers.  I got the mushroom swiss burger and it was very good. I opted for potato salad side rather than chips and that was also good - a huge portion, some would say too much?  My friend got the egg salad sandwich and said hers was good.  The prices were on the cheap side - $7 for mine, $5 for hers.  So I'll probably eat here again but it might not be my first choice with all the other downtown options.  I did enjoy the Beatles theme - my fave was the \"let it BLT.\"  I also enjoyed that the menu had \"rush\" options and a \"no rush\" option - so if you were in a rush you could order certain foods and know you'd be out quick.  My burger was a \"no rush\" food and we were easily in and out in under an hour."}
{"text":"The food is always good and the staff is always  accommodating for any of my needs or requests. The cheese curds may just be the best in town!!!"}
{"text":"I can't speak to the food here as I have never eaten it but this place has some SERIOUSLY affordable drinks for a bar on the square.  $3 for rail cocktails... This is dangerous.  The staff always seems friendly and they have a few different spaces, the upstairs has two rooms and then the downstairs bar.  They also have bands from time to time.  The new bar manager used to be at vintage and brought their fabulous Apple Pie Shots with him.  Not a bad place at all!"}
{"text":"I have gone to the Rigby about half a dozen times.  The service wasn't bad when it was busy, and they seemed to staff appropriately.  This included when I went in for a tap takeover.  The service hasn't been good though the 3 times I went and it wasn't busy.  One of the times I was just served slowly.  Another time I sat at the bar with my boyfriend for 10 minutes without even being greeted.  There are plenty of other bars near by, so we decided to move along.  The other time my boyfriend and I walked into the bar when it was empty.  We sat at the bar for 10 minutes listening to 2 employees talking in the kitchen.  One of them looked and saw us, and then went back to talking to the other employee.  After that we just decided to leave.  There's no point in staying at a bar where no one wants to serve you."}
{"text":"Ok, I've only eaten here once, but it was hands down the best burger I've had in Madison.  The fried pickle chips added a great crunch, the burger itself was perfectly done - just the right amount of pink.  The service was wonderful too, and the price is definitely right."}
{"text":"Best. Burger. Ever! Now that that's been said, very comfy, great music and atmosphere, a real 'local' feeling. Happy crowd, and for god's sake, hopefully you get Logan as your bartender because it will be impossible to leave without a smile on your face! Fantastic pub!"}
{"text":"Poor service, food is average, but they don't do requests. Been here 3 times because tables were open...now I know why. Asked to keep  jalapeños out of a 16 dollar plate of nachos, but not so lucky. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I've been to The Rigby many times for lunch and several times for happy hour. My boss loves their Cuban sandwich and their burger. Also, the French fries are the best. I've had many different items off their menu or their daily specials; some are great and some are meh. They have a nice beer selection as well."}
{"text":"Stopped into the Rigby (in the former Casbah location) earlier today with some friends, and I think it has some potential. It just opened and it's a rock (mostly Beatles) themed bar.  It's a big space (3 floors) and they did a nice job decorating. The upstairs has a pub feel with a pool table and restaurant seating up front. They are currently converting the basement into a venue, which could be awesome with a dark, cave-like feel.  I tried some of the food - the philly cheese steak and the pork sliders - both items were overly bland and tasted like something I just microwaved. Sandwiches come with ripple chips. Unless they start serving french onion dip (yum), that's not going to fly in Madison. It was 2-for-1 sandwiches and apps, which is a great deal.  Service is good, staff was very nice. I think it's a good addition to the block (if they work on their food)."}
{"text":"I just ate here twice at the taste of Madison. First time, loved both the lobster curds and the steak kabob. I loved the lobster so much we went back for more! However, when I had it the second time they smelled and tasted awful. I think they needed to change the cooking oil because it had this nasty burnt, smoky taste and smell to it. In one of them I even found this huge thing that seemed maybe like a water chestnut that was more than half the filling. I tossed most of it and was so sad that was my last food item at the taste!! Not sure if I would give the restaurant a chance since they didn't have quality control down at the taste."}
{"text":"Best hippie happy hour in Madison, if you get down on wings. M-F 3-6 they have .50 cent wings, which are by far the best wings I have ever had. They usually serve them with the sauce on the side, so if you're anything like me, don't forget to get them tossed in all that yummy sauce. The peach BBQ is like heaven, it literally made me feel like I was grubbing down on some gourmet bone nuggets. Also, $1 PBR's available during hippie happy hour. Definitely can't beat that deal when you're feeling hungry and sociable for under $10. They also have the dollar dice Shake a Day, if you're feeling lucky."}
{"text":"This place is sweet. If you like beer: well they have it for sale at this place. Curds were gooey crispy perfection and unique from standpoint of white cheese (kinda maybe). They also sell cookies all day and night-something I find a lot of value in. I also had a fish fry.... I really appreciated it. And by the way the fries are superior to most- yes. So yes. Yessssssssssssssss.       Yesssssssssss"}
{"text":"This place is really quirky, but awesome if you get to know it. It's Beatles themed, and the menu is goofy, but the fried cheese curds are fantastic, as is the jalapeno popper burger. The turkey swiss and slaw sandwich is also a winner.  If you really want a great experience, go on a Tuesday night and play trivia. Kim, the trivia reader, is hilarious, and the waitstaff are super sweet and really friendly. They have a decent beer selection"}
{"text":"I stopped in with my Sweetheart to sample the craft beer and peruse the food menu as the reveiws have been above average. It's a smallish, narrow space that doesn't carry the noise well and has lack luster bar service. After a short wait, we found a table in the front window, which is sweet for people-watching and getting a lay of the land. We ordered an app of Buffalo Wings (average), a Butterbean Burger (meh) and The Rigby Burger (ok). The server was a delight and she gave us a Free Beer token due to the lengthy wait for the food. It wasn't otherwise a particulary welcoming place, although it did seem that it is a regular hangout for the folks sitting at the bar as that's where the camaraderie lay."}
{"text":"Good bloody's but the food quality is very low and pricey for what you get. I ordered grilled shrimp salad and the shrimp were bits and pieces of shrimp and not a lot of them. The Mother Nature sandwich was delivered incorrect and was missing the main ingredient - the portobello mushroom. Disappointing experience."}
{"text":"The Rigby gets a star just for ditching the menu names referencing the Beatles.  I know I am in the minority but not a fan of the Fab 5 nor noshing on something referencing a yellow submarine.  Beyond the names, I feel they also overhauled their menu options and the kitchen is up to the task.  I give them credit with making all of their burgers using grass fed beef and the burger I went with (The California) was excellent.  The tomato jam featured on the burger was sweet if tried by itself abut paired with the argula, pepperjack, and avocado and the tasty sandwich was a winner. Beyond the food, they have a friendly staff and a sold beer list.  Much props for featuring MKE Brewing Co. and Lakefront as I feel they get overlooked in the Madison market."}
{"text":"We had our wedding rehearsal dinner at the Rigby in their upstairs space!  We had about 40 people with a wide range of ages from 5-65. Everyone loved it! The space was perfect for the # of people (everyone was free to walk around to socialize). They set up a private bar and were able to give drink tickets to our guests.  The food and service was amazing! We had the Italian buffet and everyone loved it! They really put a lot care and attention in everything they did.  They even put our favorite drink on special for us!  Angie did a great job helping us plan the event and ensure everything went flawless.  The location was perfect for our guests to be downtown off the square."}
{"text":"I've never eaten here, but I've seen a few shows and had drinks here. There was one server who was pretty undesirable, but I was informed that she no longer works there. The rest of the staff is very warm and welcoming. The drinks are always good. The Rigby draws a crowd, but never really feels packed. The location is fantastic.  The live performances are intimate. Overall, a great place to spend a Saturday night or a nice Sunday afternoon (all day happy hour prices)."}
{"text":"I came to The Rigby late night on a Friday and was greeted to an empty bar. Honestly, I was kind of pumped - my companion and I wanted to talk and we could actually hear each other / have free run of the jukebox. In talking to the super friendly and attentive (but not invasive) bartender it sounds like it's not uncommon for the crowd to wax and wane there over the course of the evening; we'd just missed a large group leaving and were later greeted by a large crew shortly before bar time.  Generally I'd say The Rigby is a pretty average bar with an above-average bartender. He made me feel welcome and not just like someone he'd be handing a check to in an hour."}
{"text":"I tried The Rigby this past Saturday with friends. \"Medium\" experience -- more of a 2.5 -- but I don't think that I'll return.   There were plenty of positives: the location is great; there is plenty of outdoor seating; the interior was pretty cool. There were high notes on the food, too: the fried dill pickles and onion straws were delish, the bacon on the burgers was fantastic, and the bun on my hamburger (yes really), was super soft and tasty (so much so that we each commented on the bread -- crazy!).   The negatives weren't horrible -- just enough to make the experience pretty average in my book. The menu isn't huge and isn't different from many places on the Square (sandwiches, cheese curds, beer). The food was fine, even good, don't get me wrong -- it just wasn't AWESOME. The prices were a smidge high -- my GF and I spent more than $30 on two burgers, two sodas, and an appetizer. The service was only okay -- our server was super nice, but the place definitely felt like a BAR that oh yeah, we serve food, too. The music was LOUD. Like, crazy loud. Like, shout over it and still can't be heard loud. The seating was kind of minimal and there were zero chairs or stools with backs. I didn't visit the bathroom but my friend did and declared it musty and a little dirty.   SO -- a little nit picky on this stuff? Sure. But with so many great options on the Square -- hell, on King Street/E Main alone -- I'm looking for great, not just okay. And my experience was just okay."}
{"text":"Terrific Tuesday night trivia! Good beer selection on tap (Fixed Gear, Hoppalicious, Fatty Boombalatty, one of the Vintage taps...). \"Hippie Hour\" 4-7pm includes $3 rails and taps, $1 PBR and free snacks. The Rigby is Beatles themed and the long wooden bar is an unexpectedly nice place to sit and enjoy a pint."}
{"text":"The Rigby is a pub I have always passed by on my way to either the Argus or the Tipsy Cow, but since both were packed on Friday, we wandered into The Rigby. And what a happy discovery that was...from 4-7pm on Mon-Fri, they have $3 taps and rails, $1 hippie sangria (as far as I could tell it was just normal sangria), $1 PBR, and $0.25 CENT WINGS. After 3 glasses of the hippie sangria, I was ready to eat some wings, but unfortunately we had made other food plans beforehand. I had a good look at their menu before the sangria, and would definitely like to go back and try the jalepeno or mac and cheese poppers. Also, food and drinks are 1/2 off from 2-4pm Mon-Fri, so give it a try during that time if you're not sure!"}
{"text":"This place is quickly becoming my favorite spot.  The bartenders are always spot-on; super friendly and attentive, willing to provide suggestions and knowledgeable. The crowd is always pretty diverse and I notice it gets busy in waves quite often.  I know they are always hosting events like open mic and trivia because they have space both upstairs and downstairs.  The decor here is awesome, I swear I'd hang one of those chandeliers in my own house!  Great music is always playing - and not just one genre, it's all over the board.  They've recently updated their menu so I decided to try the Mediterranean bowl. Lots of delicious veggies (some grilled) over couscous.  My fiance had the pulled pork sliders and wished they had sauced them up a bit more.  On another trip we ordered their seasonal cheese curds which, we were told, resembled jalepeno poppers.  We thought they tasted more like taco but they did have a really nice spice to them.  It was definitely more of a nacho/cream cheese filling than an actual curd but they were fantastic! Heavily breaded and quite large - guilty pleasure for sure =)  They have a bunch of infused liquors that I highly recommend trying.  The jalapeno-pickle vodka makes for a wonderful bloody mary. My fiance is a huge fan of the honey-habanero whiskey as a press."}
{"text":"I came to dinner at the patio, and it was a great experience with really tasty food! I had the fish fry and my friend had the Rigby burger, and we both enjoyed the food and our time there. We then went upstairs got some drinks and went to the comedy night they were hosting. I was surprised I hadn't been there before since I enjoyed my time and there were lots of things to do!"}
{"text":"Do you ever psyche yourself up for an experience but you have a feeling that it's not all cracked up to what you thought?  Before I got there I knew that I would like the music and the decorations.   Dark menu-No that's cool I want to squint my youthful eyes at excessive descriptions.   Fish fry-was two pieces of soaked fish that were extremely unpleasant on my tongue.  The fries were not worth crying about.   The chicken tenders were tough, come on bros, THEY'RE CHICKEN TENDERS. How can you go wrong?  This place has potential, it should work it's way from the website to the menu to the service."}
{"text":"This place is just OK. The bartender walked by to-be-orderers several times before noticing them. Drinks were sufficiently stiff. The food was hit and miss.   Nachos - cheese sauce (come on, we're in WI!) and very little cheese. The meat on top was dry, almost like jerkey. It must have gone on before it was broiled, or it sat under the heat lamp for too long. It should have not been served; it clearly looked dry.   Chicken Tenders - overall quite good. Good but probably not home made BBQ sauce. Fries were just OK.   Cheese Curds - very good, but not the best in town. Although unusual, the dipping sauce was an interesting change of pace. I think it was ranch dressing mixed with Franks Red Hot.    We got a goodie bag of free baked goods just before we left, which was a nice touch and a creative way of marketing.   I am tempted to take off another star because stakeholders in the business clearly wrote their own 5-star reviews (that were filtered out by yelp)"}
{"text":"Decent beer selection, pretty cool interior, delicious cheese curds but not worth the $11 price tag. There were legit like 8 curds on the plate. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Service coulda been good but they decided to be sexist and kick the male friend out, when  I, the girl, had drank much more. Save your money and go to Argus next door."}
{"text":"Walked in with pretty low expectations given the size of the place and amount of people in it (one other), but left extremely satisfied. The food was delicious (had chicken tenders and waffle fries- tenders had awesome seasoning), bartenders were friendly and took my order quickly, and the atmosphere was kinda neat. I'm no Beatles or classic rock fan, but the place has an interesting vibe to it.   Will be back sometime soon!"}
{"text":"As far as pub grub goes, I was pleasantly surprised with the fare! White curds and sauce perfect combo of crispy and spicy while the fish sandwich was tasty and well-prepared. If you're in the neighborhood for quick meal, you could do a lot worse!"}
{"text":"Thank baby Jezus: Food till 2am. Is it the best food you're going to eat this year? Mmmmmmmmm, no. BUT, remember, it's 2am, does it matter?"}
{"text":"Team Trivia here on Tuesday nights, but there are better options in Madison.  There are two floors, and there is a basement that wasn't open (cave-themed, a relic of its previous tenant, the Casbah).  We opted for second floor seating.  I immediately noticed that the it's the \"Rigby Pub & Grill\" but there's no drink menu!  A server just had the beers on tap written on the back of a receipt but that's it.  In some areas of the restaurant, some beverage options were written on a chalkboard, but there was no way to see that from my table.  There were about 7 taps.  Appetizer: Cheese curds, tempura style, served with buffalo dip.  Curds were good, although I prefer a sauce other than buffalo.  Magical Mushroom Burger: A disappointment.  Normal sides include pub chips, coleslaw, and potato salad.  I ordered fries for an additional surcharge.  The fries were oily.  As for the burger, the menu said that it came with \"caramelized mushrooms and onions.\"  To me, this implies that the onions are caramelized.  They were sauteed, not caramelized.  Team Trivia was fine. A forewarning; if you are on the 2nd floor, you have to run down to the 1st floor to drop off your entry, so if your team is the type to procrastinate, sit on the 1st floor.  Overall, \"eh.\"  I would not go back."}
{"text":"OK, I've been returning for Team Trivia. Service has gotten much better, and they have beer lists on all the tables now! This rapid and positive change is enough to get another star from me.  The food is good; I recommend chips over fries. I think happy hour is 3-6 now, with specials each day."}
{"text":"Got in, as they opened this morning, with a group of friends.  Obviously, as postal employees, we have this week off.  I ordered a couple beers and some curds to celebrate the Christmas season.  We all toasted and were having a great time.  The staff is so friendly at this place, and no matter how crowded it gets, they are always attentive.  Then Hank walked in.  The first thing he did was yell, \"Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep!\" As he entered.  Everyone looked.  The mood instantly turned south.  We all tried to be quiet, to not gain his attention.  He was bundled up in a big coat and huge goofy hat, in his defense, it is 25 degrees out right now.  He sat down alone, and started being annoying to everyone.  \"Hank needs a whiskey to warm up!\"  I don't know why he thinks it's funny to refer to himself in the third person, but he kept doing it.  There wasn't a staff member near him when he screamed, \"HANK NEEDS SOME CURDS!\"  I recommend The Rigby.  I do not recommend Hank.  Merry Christmas."}
{"text":"Worst pour ever this weekend, 12oz in a 16oz glass, next time I come, I'll bring my own measuring cup.  Also, the bartender lied and said it was a standard pour. The place is as full as it's glasses are of beer anyway, and every time I go it's full of the bartender's weirdo friends."}
{"text":"Great  Hippie Hour 2-6pm.  $1 classic taps 50c wings $10 beer flight $1 off drinks  ...but check out the spinach artichoke dip"}
{"text":"Back at the Rigby for lunch! Happy to see the steak sandwich back on the grill/ tender- perfectly cooked and served with a tasty sauce on toasted bun with onion rings! Shared the boneless buffalo chicken tenders- zinggggg! Tasty and just the right heat! Thanks for a great lunch and the carrot cake tasting!"}
{"text":"This place is just fine. They have a decent tap line-up and some okay food options. It's kinda of fun because it's rock'n'roll themed, but they don't incorporate the Beatles any further than the name and some wall paintings. (Where is the 'Yellow Submarine Sandwich'? What about the 'Lovely Rita Wrap'?) I'd go here with a few people to drink and maybe get a snack, but not with a big group and not for a meal."}
{"text":"Excellent fish fry and other food items. Great beer selection. Reasonably priced. Friendly bartenders. A must when on the square!"}
{"text":"Nom nom nom! I love the Rigby!   I've been in here now many times. I don't always order food, but when I do, it's never disappointing. Larger portions, fresh ingredients, creative menu options. It's wonderful!  Today I had the walnut and apple salad, sans bleu cheese, sub feta, and add chicken. Wow, they do not skimp on the chicken. For. $3 upgrade I was very happy with the amount of perfectly grilled chicken that way laid atop my mountain of delicious greens. Not often does a salad get the better of me, but I couldn't finish this bad boy. Got too full!  Tried their chicken noodle soup as well tonight. Honestly one of the best chicken noodles I've had.   The BF got the Cuban with mashed potatoes. The potatoes were really great. I didn't try the sandwich but he said it was great.   Rigby has a great atmosphere, it's trendy but casual, lots of cool stuff up on the walls to check out. There are 3 levels as well, so they host events and whatnot pretty often.   My *only* complaint about this place, and it's not really about the Rigby, it applies to Argus and Francesca's as well - is the sorry excuse of bathroom facilities. Now I know it's on the building and not the individual establishments, but shit. The ladies room is a joke. It's super awkwardly laid out, extremely tight, and the water is ice cold at best. But, whatevs. I'll still frequent the building, for all 3 spots!"}
{"text":"They have a good beer selection although as it warms up it is good to see some of those heavier winter beers go. They had a lot of porters and stouts which is fine with me because that is my bread and butter. They were in the process of transitioning into the lighter spring beers as a lot of places are.   I am usually pretty leery of fish fry because often they are over breaded. The Rigby had nice thick pieces of cod that were lightly breaded. The fries were ok but they had surprisingly great coleslaw. I usually set that aside but ate all of it.   The bartender and waitstaff were are really attentive and fun to BS with. Wish I would have been going here longer.  The menu and food is simple mostly bar food but the do it really well from what I saw."}
