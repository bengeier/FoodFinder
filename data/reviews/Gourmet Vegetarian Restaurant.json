{"text":"It is a vegetarian restaurant and as a meat eater I cannot expect much of course. The food in fine, the waiters there are friendly and helpful. Their service is good. The food is oily though. So do not expect that it is going to be healthy just because you heard of the word vegetarian food."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian but surprisingly enough, when I ate the food here, I didn't seem to miss the meat at all. It's amazing how they can use tofu and soy to mold it into mock meats that taste and have the same texture as real meat! 
The food portions sizes are also pretty big and they come out fresh and hot. Not to mention the prices are great as well. I ordered a plate of roasted pork, fish maw soup, fried rice, and a taro bird's nest to share among 5 people and the bill came up to around $40! I'll definitely be back as their service is also fast and efficient which is a definite plus!"}
{"text":"My family and I go here for both lunch and dinner regularly since my mom is vegetarian. We've been to all the vegetarian restaurants around town (Graceful, Lotus Pond, and even King's Cafe downtown) but Gourmet Vegetarian Restaurant remains our favourite go-to one. 

The lunch dim sum selection is great, with a variety of spring rolls, dumplings, and congee, in addition to any of the rice and noodles offered on the regular menu. For dinner, some yummy options include pan-fried \"oysters\" which come on a sizzling plate, as well as the sweet and sour \"pork\". Another family favourite is the salty \"fish\" and \"chicken\" fried rice (tastes just like the real thing!). 

I do agree with other reviewers that the food is towards the greasier side, but this is the case with all the other vegetarian restaurants as well. Gourmet, IMO, has the best selection and best tasting food of all the chinese vegetarian joints! The friendly service is a plus as well."}
{"text":"I've never eaten at a Chinese vegetarian restaurant and finally had the chance to go.  I was pleasantly surprised at the very large menu.  It looked like a typical Chinese restaurant menu.  The servers were friendly and efficient.  We tried one of their newer dishes, BBQ pork and I was a sceptical at first.  But it actually tasted really good and had the same flavouring as BBQ pork but of course a different texture but still flavourful.  We also tried several other dishes and I was amazed at how everything was tasty and without meat!  I stuffed myself but unlike being stuffed after eating meat it didn't feel heavy.  It was like going to a regular Chinese restaurant except it was vegetarian.  I'm not vegetarian but I did really enjoy my meal.  The restaurant is very no frills but that's fine by me as long as the food is good.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great food. Excellent staff. Make reservation got very busy by 6 pm and we noticed all tables reserved by then! Will b back for the sweet and sour meatball and chicken the table had beside us and it looked so good . Had the singaporian rice YUM ."}
{"text":"it was a cold winter evening and I had in mind soup for meal, something warm to heat me up.

the mushroom with rice noodle and sticks is very tasty; I devoured the bowl leaving it empty.    

I will return."}
{"text":"I have visited this restaurant recently twice.  The d√©cor, cleanliness and the service maintains the same average standard with service a bit better most likely depend on the number of patronages at the time.

Its main dish for the veggie which display near the door is worse than last time.  One of the bamboo skin somehow got deep fried.  Although it is not bad, there can be better one, even last time is better.  The fish soup has a lot of corn starch and is salty.  The pot of rice with Shanghai bean curd is not bad.  The spinach dish is the best both for its volume and taste.

I will give it a 3 stars but if the food quality, especially the main veggie dish deteriorates, then a 2 stars is coming."}
{"text":"Went here for the dim sum after seeing it on a previous trip to ambassador. 

Order: 
Various bean curd rolls (fairly good, not standout but not disappointing)
Bean curd and gluten (best dish by far, love the curry and sweet and sour bean curds, also most expensive)
Eggplant and black bean
Siu Mai (texture doesn't hit the spot, best consumed quickly noticed that it dried quickly)
Shrimp dumpling (shrimp is not quite the same, imagine imitation crab texture)
Beef balls (great texture, emulates the real thing quite well)
Cheung fan (filled with diced tofu, wished the tofu would actually stay in it though)
Turnip cake (quite starchy, it is nothing to rave over)
Custard & egg dumpling (Very tasty, definitely keep your eye on as they go quickly!)

Overall cost $45 for five people, not too bad and to be honest we ordered a bit too much too so it could have been even cheaper.

Definitely coming here again!"}
{"text":"Tasty food and fast services. but the price was a little bit high and the dinning environment was a little bit crowd. Don't mind to try again."}
{"text":"I go to this place quite regularly, maybe once a week, sometimes more. I'm not a vegetarian but I really enjoy the food. The assorted bean curd appetizer is a must eat. I'm also a huge fan of the deep fried bean curd wrapped in seaweed in sweet corn sauce, very good! The price is really good and lunch can easily be had for under $10 per person."}
{"text":"Cash only and charge tax and the service is not amazing  ..... You have been warned 

And food is oook"}
{"text":"I tried a bunch of meats and dim sum dishes here. Everything was just okay. The sweet and sour chicken was amazing though."}
{"text":"We came on Chinese new year day and were limited to a one page set menu and no substitutions allowed. We ended up ordering the 4 course menu and added an appetizer dish of different gluten and seitan. There was nothing special with the dishes...very basic, flavour was pretty bland especially the tofu and mushroom dish. 2.5 stars because i did not like that they restricted us to a  set menu and for lack of choice and flavours..food was also premade and 5 dishes came out in 5 minutes after ordering. They were also not extremely busy so not sure why they had to do this.  I would prefer Wutai on woodbine...much fancier and tastier options. Free green bean soup dessert though. Bill came up to 70 bucks out the door for 4 people."}
{"text":"This is my go to restaurant in Richmond Hill when I get my vegan Asian food cravings. They've got the greasy, authentic, Chinese comfort food and the healthier options too. 
The quality of the food has been consistently good. The quality of the service has been consistently meh. 
Note that you can ask for no msg and no egg (for my fellow vegans)."}
{"text":"The best Vegetarian food ever !! Def will recommend to try even if you are a carnivore! This is a must try place !!"}
{"text":"Delicious dim sum. So nice knowing that I can eat whatever I want and not have to worry about meat. I had the enoki beef dumplings, the steamed bean curd sheet, and the spice fried fish. Loved it all!

On the down side, it's kind of a pain that they only accept cash. And the menu is a little hard to understand if you don't read Chinese. But neither of those things will stop me from coming back."}
{"text":"Came here on a few occasions and it seems this place is fairly popular. In comparison to my favourite chinese vegetarian restaurant (Graceful Vegetarian), this restaurant is definitely far more affordable. They have a wide array of menu items, and in my opinion they seem to do fried items the best. They use a well seasoned batter, and fried items are super crispy. Try their interpretation of fried \"eel\" which uses a fungi to imitate the texture of eel!

My only gripe about this restaurant is that they are super heavy on oil and seasoning. Generally when I go to a vegetarian restaurant I aim to have a lighter meal, but unfortunately since their best items are fried it is difficult to escape from grease and saltiness. I would also recommend bypassing the soups. Not the best quality and not the best tasting.

A must try here is their signature dessert sweet soups! My personal favourite is the cashew one. I believe they make all their dessert soups in house and they're super popular! Better snatch those up early if you're buying the dessert soups to go though since they tend to sell out by the evening."}
{"text":"Decor: bland but what do you expect for a place in a plaza?

Price: thumbs up! For a large hot n' sour soup that could've fed 6 adults, and 5 dishes, it came to $60.

Service: muted but the food came fast. i was a little put off when i went to the bathroom and one of the servers did just a one-hand rinse with just water. 

Food: an insane amount of selection! gets a little weird when you see spaghetti in the headers since it's chinese vegetarian food (maybe a result of lost in translation??) but i stuck to the main dishes. The best dish was this mushroom vermacelli dish and this chicken black bean dish (which reminded my boyfriend of shake n' bake for some reason but i had to agree). We ordered this deep fried eggplant dish which suspiciously tasted like it was sauteed in ketchup. Wasn't horrible but I think i'll stay away from the thai dishes here next time. 

Overall, I recommend it for vegetarians and even if you're a carnivore!"}
{"text":"This is one of my regular places I go eat as a vegetarian.  Not too expensive and food is decent.  The service is good but not great.  Place is not upscale like a few around town.  I would recommend this to people who have not been there and are vegetarian.  Give it a try."}
{"text":"Gourmet Vegetarian is not \"gourmet\" if we are going by the dictionary definition.  However, it is a family friendly, low key, no nonsense place to have a good chinese vegetarian meal, be it dim sum or dinner served by very efficient staff.

Favourite dim sum offerings include fried turnip \"cake\", rice rolls with veg and tofu, veg chicken with hot and sour sauce and pan fried \"meat\" dumplings.  They also offer various steamed dumplings including har gow and siu mai, as well as decent congee and soup noodle selections.

Dinner favourites include curry \"chicken\", \"beef\" and bitter melon stir fry.  Their hot and sour soup (red) is one of the better ones I've had.  Many mock meat dishes to choose from and portions are huge."}
{"text":"I don't usually go to vegetarian restaurant as I would eat fair bit of vegetables with meat, I don't need to go having a vegetarian day once a week or once a month.

wanted to try out this place as many people told me this is a good place.

Mixed tofu sheet rolls and gluten pieces, it's probably the worst presentation I have seen. it's like they took few dishes of left overs from other tables and put them together.
the tofu pieces has no flavor, not salty nor sweet. the red gluten should taste sour, was just flavorless. and the one should be a curry taste, was simply hot with loads of red pepper seeds, but no curry spice at all...(well, may be some coloring?)

at this point, we were ready to cancel all the other orders and leave.

the other dim sum arrives, these are dim sum made with all vegetables or with imitation meat. the looks really resembles regular dim sum. but the wrapping on the steamed dumpling was so thick and chewy, it's not good eats.

I won't go again, and I wouldn't suggest anyone to go too."}
{"text":"This place is so good!! Being a vegan, I am especially excited. The restaurant itself is not extremely big or pretty but the ENTIRE menu is fully vegetarian and vegan. I had the curry chicken and one of the fried rice dishes and both were very good. They also have a ton of options on their menu."}
{"text":"I was craving Chinese food that wouldn't be too heavy and came across this place on yelp. My husband and I ordered 3 dishes for dinner and our food was delicious.

Definitely a place we would come again to"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to eat there yesterday. We were the only ones there . They were very nice and welcoming as soon as we walked in we were given a tea pot.. I was honestly so grossed out because the tip of the teapot (where the tea is being poured) was so dirty and filled with black dirt that was stuck to it. 
We came in for some soups and they only had a wonton noodle soup so we each took one of those.
Another couple walked in and ordered a bunch of stuff about 10 mins after we ordered. They got all their food before we got our soups.  I kid you not when I say they used an entire pack of noodles in one bowl of soup. I've never seen anything like that- it was just too much and made it so uncomfortable to eat the soup because you couldn't even get to the liquid and wontons. 
The fact that the place wasn't esthetically appealing was the only huge no no for me. I won't be coming back there because of the cleanliness but other than that they really do deserve a nice review because they tried so hard."}
{"text":"Food was good; some of the dishes are indisguishable from their meat counterparts.

Although the menu is overwhelming, they really need to simplify that a bit, and it's cash only. It would have been great to know, especially since I don't usually carry more than 10 dollars in cash at time."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant on happy cow so I decided to check out their vegan Chinese food. The menu has a great selection of vegetarian mock meats. I told the waitress that I was vegan and she recommended me the meatballs and the beef noodles. Ask for no eggs.

Overall their food is legit and delicious. Big portions so don't get carried away! Nice, spacey decor. Friendly service. Cash only. Overall great restaurant and surely worth a try."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE. Purchased nearly $100 in food on credit card via Door Dash (cash option NOT available), waited almost two hours and food never showed up. Turns out the restaurant does not accept anything but cash, so refused to let delivery driver take our food even though they had already processed our card and taken the money out. When I was talking to the lady at the restaurant, I told her that she was stealing from us by taking our money and not providing the food we paid for, she freaked out and started speaking to someone at the  restaurant (manager, I presume) and then she asked if someone around me spoke Chinese, I said no and she hung up on me. Learned that these people are SCAMS the hard way. Do not order from them and pay with card, they will take your money and then tell you they only accept cash. Will be reporting them to the proper authorities."}
{"text":"Recommend their gluten and bean curd (pronounced as \"jai lo mei\" in Cantonese) regular size at $7.50 before tax. Courteous staff, clean environment, fairly quiet on weekday nights."}
{"text":"The service was mediocre and the food was fine until we noticed a hair in the food.

Ordered the pineapple fried rice, lemon chicken, fried Veggie Dumplings, Steamed Dumplings and Fried Turnip Patties with X.O sauce. 

The Pan Fried dumplings had no taste and I was disappointed because I love Dumplings. Their dough is too thick and flavourless, and veggies have no flavour either. 

The steamed dumplings were not what we expected, the skin was too thick as well and so gel- like I couldn't stomach to try it. 

Although the dim-sum was disappointing, I enjoyed the main dishes until...  my friend found an eyelash or small hair in the chicken dish. 

I was so grossed out, that it ruined the whole eating experience for me, even if I liked their fried rice & chicken. After eating I had a stomach ache for awhile, might be related to this place or not but I didn't feel so good after dining here.

Wish I could say I had a better experience. Would not come back."}
{"text":"This is one of my moms favorite vegetarian restaurants in the area and we frequently come here. The food is great and flavorful. The restaurant is small and casual. It may get busy during lunch hours but the wait usually isn't long. They also have some items to buy for takeout and my family buys those too. I recommend this restaurant if you want to have a vegetarian meal in the area."}
{"text":"This is my family's go-to Vegetarian spot, especially for some Bean Curd and Marinated Gluten..yes that doesn't sound appetizing in any way but it sure is good! It certainly looks dated from the inside, however they have a variety of vegetarian dishes as well as dim sum. 

We usually go with the Fried Taro Patties, which come in a circular shape of mashed taro, wrapped inside a roll of bean curd and deep fried, which tastes delicious when dipped into the Sweet and Sour sauce. Another one of my favourites are the Pan Fried Vegetable Buns, which are loaded with mushrooms. The Fried Noodles with Vegetables is simple but incredibly tasty as they add plenty of crunchy bean sprouts and mushrooms. One MUST ORDER dish here would be the Vegetable Spring Rolls which are huge and loaded with crisp veggies. These are nothing like the $1 for 10 you would get at the grocery store. The Fried Dough Fritter wrapped in Rice Noodle was poorly executed as you can tell from the picture and was super soggy and slimy. We also got the Fried Milk which is great as well. 

This is not a bad place to get some vegetarian food, as the staff are always very nice."}
{"text":"The 1st impression of the place was it was very worn down. But I think their main business are people they cater to for a long time. My friend made reservations a few days ago. But apparently they lost our reservation notice, but it was a good thing they had a table for us, as our party was quite a big group. The restaurant itself is quite small, so it's best to get reservations ahead of time or else you won't get a table. 

As we were waiting for the rest of our group to arrive, no one really gave us any drinks. We eventually had to ask for it. Another negative is they had their assorted gluten by the entrance door, and every time someone came in our the door was open, a draft or a person's cough can get to it. But regardless I was a sucker and still ordered it to eat :P My husband also did find a small strand of hair in one of our dishes...but we let it go.

Overall food wise, it was quite good and tasty. But keep in mind this place is a very low key joint, so don't expect fancy gourmet dishes, it's more home style."}
{"text":"It took my dad and me about fifteen minutes to get a seat on a Sunday evening, as the restaurant was packed with many families. There's only one table meant for two people, so we had to wait for that one couple to finish their meal...

My dad and I ordered the chow mein and the small assorted gluten platter. I found that assorted gluten to be a bit too oily for my liking, but for $5.99 the quantity and the great tasting flavour made up for it. The noodles were pretty good, although the quantity in noodle was a bit meager in my opinion. 

It also took us a while to get our bill. For some reason, they were waiting to give it to us. When my dad asked what was taking so long, they said that they were trying to confirm the third dish that we ordered and was waiting for it to be served. When my dad clarified that we never ordered a third dish, they hesitated, but then gave it to us right away. It just seemed a bit foolish having to wait for confirmation from the kitchen when they could have just asked us directly.

Great tasting food. Questionable service. I would like to come back at another time when it is less busy to give it another try."}
{"text":"I came here to grab some vegan food. The place seemed old and need some renovation. The food was good but the tea pot were too old and seemed dirty I will suggest new pots for better service. The place seemed original and felt like I am in chines restaurant, which is good but the washroom was old and need maintenance also they were making spring rolls out side in public which I found weird. 

Over all food was good but the place was old and need improvment."}
{"text":"this place is probably one of the, if not the, best vegetarian restaurants in toronto.  they do dim sum too although it can be quite starchy.  they do lunch and dinner.  this place will get very busy when there is a full moon.  reserve when that is the case.  i think they have cut down on the msg but gourmet vegetarian rest uses a lot of mock meat stuff from taiwan which do contain msg.  they make an awesome eggless fried rice which is hard to do without eggs.  the menu can be quite daunting since there is so much stuff on it.  also be aware that some dishes are really the same but cooked in a different way or made with a different sauce."}
{"text":"Really great place for plenty of vegetarian options. I've tried multiple dishes now for dinner and have always been impressed by the variety available.  The one dish that attracted me the most was D11 which is their version of fried 'fish' fillets with a soya sauce gravy.  The texture and taste was spot on, which is hard to do for vegetarian substitutes. I've never had a better fake fish.

Besides the main dishes, they are also know for their almond, walnut or sesame 'paste' desserts. Don't be deterred by the odd colours of their paste (white, brown, black respectively). No powder dissolved substitutes here, this is the real thing. It toes the line between being slightly grainy for authenticity but still delivering on the smooth texture expected from a sweet dessert.  The almond paste was really fragrant and flavourful without being overly cloyingly sweet. 

The english translation of the dishes needs some heavy editing, but that shouldn't deter the adventurous. Try something new out!

Pro tip: You can ask them to go easy on the salt, oil or skip out on the MSG if you want!!"}
{"text":"Okay - updating my review. I came here for my first cousin's (once removed)'s 100th day birthday or whatever you'd like to call it. We came here one of those \"9-course meals\" kinda things and it was AWESOME. Service was impeccable, and the food was SO good -- like ridiculously good. Everything was made out of tofu, soy, etc, and looked (and tasted ABSOLUTELY) delicious. Definitely will recommend.

(And I came here again for dim sum, and you know what? Not bad! I guess my first time wasn't the best)."}
{"text":"Simple and yummy!
Most items we've order is pretty good. Avoid getting the steamed rice roll with mock beef as the rice roll was thick and not mixed well. 

Their dim sum and assort bean cured dishes are great.
Curry style samosa are very good but small... Inside

Msg level seems to me none to very low
Chilli oil (everyone's favourite) is spicy!"}
{"text":"Gourmet Vegetarian is a Buddhist vegetarian restaurant.  Unlike Graceful Vegetarian at Market Village, Gourmet Vegetarian targets to be an inexpensive and down-to-earth vegetarian restaurant.  This review is about the few dinner experiences I have had.

Food: The imitation meat really looks like the real thing.  I always have fun trying to see if the various vegetarian meats, made out of tofu, taste like the real deals.  The texture, however, is hits and misses.  The food is on the oily side.  However, the restaurant allows you to specify less oil, less salt, less sugar, no MSG, etc., when you place the orders.  I usually ask to have no MSG and less oil, and the food still tastes delicious.  I often find that the dishes that don't require imitation meat, such as spicy long beans (not that spicy at all), mushroom with vegetables, etc., taste impressively good.  The portion is big.

Services: The services are effective and friendly.  I think the waiters and waitresses here are just really nice people.

Decor: The interior decoration is non-descriptive.  There are a few Chinese calligraphy paintings hanged on the walls.

In conclusion, I enjoy the meals here as they are simple.  This Chinese restaurant is also suitable for people for any ethnic groups who need to eat vegetarian dishes."}
{"text":"This place is an alright veggie resto with reasonable prices.

Their food is flavourful and the menu has a greater variety of flavours compared to some other vegetarian restaurants where everything tastes the same. It's kind of your standard greasy Chinese food here though, so don't expect to walk away with a \"healthy\" meal by any means. The dimsum here is OK but nothing special -- I would much prefer Wutai or Graceful Vegetarian for more interesting, high-quality dimsum. Essentially, I only come to this place when I am looking for a cheaper, no-frills vegetarian meal.

It's a massive menu and none of the descriptions sound very appetizing, so here are a few of my personal go-to items: 
- Veggie Meatball Thai-Style (sweet and savoury, just a slight hint of spice, mock meat is lightly fried, topped with some green/red peppers and pineapples)
- Deep fried veggie chicken (salt and pepper deep fried veggie meat served with some red/green peppers and peanuts)
- Any of the veggie chicken hot plates (these are the sizzling plates)
- Rolls of seafood and bean curd on hot plate (basically tastes like mock fish served with something that's kind of like a black bean sauce)
- Veggie meat ball in sweet and sour sauce (basically mock sweet and sour pork)
- Hot Pot: Bean curd stick w/ veggie tender beef (interestingly the Chinese name calls this mock lamb and not beef, and that's really what it's closer to being)
- Fried rice noodle with XO sauce, satay sauce, or just plain ol' veggie beef, depending on my mood

Generally I don't really recommend the mock beef here because it doesn't taste all that great. The mock chicken tends to be much better.

Don't expect spectacular service. It's pretty barebones, just gets the job done. As a nice touch they often serve up some dessert on the house (some form of \"sweet soup\"). They do NOT accept credit cards by the way."}
{"text":"My go to vegetarian restaurant. Food and service always consistently good. Very good portions, and did I mention that yes its all vegetarian (mock meat)!"}
{"text":"I should start with a disclaimer: I'm a big meat eater. My friends nicknamed me carnivore in high school because of it. When my mom said she wanted to try a vegetarian place I was hesitant to say the least but this place definitely didn't make me miss the meat. The star off was mainly for the uncomfortable chairs and tables and that it wasn't really \"gourmet\" cuisine. 

We got the assorted gluten and bean curd ($5.50), veggie steak with BBQ sauce ($8.99) and fried rice with tomato and cream sauce ($10.99). We also asked for less oil and no msg which is always a nice option to have since Chinese food tends to be on the greasy msg-y side. 

The portions were good for the price and we only finished about 2/3 of the food with enough leftovers for the next day. 

I love assorted bean curds so no complaints there other than they could've cut the pieces a little smaller so it'd be more bite size. Big dish for $5.50 too!

The \"steak\" with BBQ sauce was pretty good too. The texture was very meat-like and it had pineapples, celery and green/red peppers. There was a little too much sauce for my liking but that's just personal preference. 

I liked the rice the most out of the 3 dishes. The sauces were made well and the rice was flavourful and fragrant. There were these imitation squid pieces on the cream side that I can only describe the texture in Chinese but I really liked it. 

They also give complimentary dessert soup and we got the cashew flavour. All their dessert soups are homemade and you can definitely tell. It was delicious. So good we got the walnut dessert soup ($4.50) to bring home for later and it was amazing! Nothing like homemade dessert soup. 

There's so many different dishes we will definitely be back to try more!"}
{"text":"+.5 for service

Been here a couple of times now. I think this restaurant has been here for a long time, but I'm rarely in this plaza so I never had the chance to explore the choices here. Recently I came here to run an errand and noticed a couple of interesting restaurants that stood out, such as this one.

There's not much to the design of this restaurant; it's quite a no frills place. Both times I arrived for lunch and only had their dim sum menu, and I also purchased some veggie turnip cake for takeout since it was Chinese New Year.

Their turnip cake is quite good, and thick as well. Portions are quite big. The mock meat that they use is decent (e.g: siu mai, beef dumplings), though if you're not used to mock meat it might taste a little weird at first. If you don't know where to start, definitely start with the turnip cake.

My gripe with this place, however, is that they're quite heavy on MSG. Yes, vegetarian restaurants use MSG too! You get that thirst in your mouth quite fast after you finish your meal, so be sure you drink a lot of tea/water when you're eating.

Service is good for Asian standards. Don't expect much, but you won't be yelled at for no reason at all.

If Wu Tai or Graceful is off your budget scale, this place is a good substitute for what it's worth."}
{"text":"My favourite Vegetarian restaurant! Your old school Chinese restaurant serving veggie only (no onion and garlic) and it specifies if the dish contains eggs. I have been going there since they first opened...and so I am biased lol"}
{"text":"A few months prior, my family came here (without me) and weren't particularly impressed. Another friend recommended it to me, but my sister decided to settle the matter by bringing me here to see who was right. Well, my conclusion is that this has got to be the worst vegetarian restaurant I've ever been to, near Toronto. And this is being backed up by four other members of my family, including my 92-year-old Chinese grandmother. So the lesson of the day is that there is such a thing as bad vegetarian cuisine.

And the second lesson? 

My family is usually right, especially when it comes to food.

The food is excessively salty, greasy and just plain gross. I felt like I was in eating a canteen. Due to the bad experience, my brain blocked out the memories of what we had to eat. However, the one dish I DO recall was the only passable one - e-fu noodes* were presented in a light broth with some greens. It was the only dish we finished.

There were leftovers, but we didn't even want to take them home.

While the service here is friendly and the prices are awesome, we're not going back here; there's nothing gourmet about this place.

*Traditionally, e-fu noodles are braised with shittake mushrooms. They are made by frying and are cooked again before being served. Often served as a birthday dish, since long noodles represent longevity."}
{"text":"Given my (and my friends') preference to eat vegetarian food, the name of this place says all there is to know about that. Servers always ask if egg is OK (even when ordering an egg dish) and no alcohol is served. I've also not seen onions used (to the best of my recollection) there for people who have that restriction as well.

The food is consistent and tasty, but far from \"gourmet\". The veggie meats are the best I've tried most anywhere, admittedly that isn't a great list as I stopped trying other places after this one. The menu is MASSIVE, including all sorts of dishes for those accustomed to Cantonese (and some more northern-inspired) cuisine as well as the uninitiated palate."}
{"text":"I stumbled across this place while on lunch from work.

They had a dim sum menu and I pretty much ordered everything on it. It was really good for vegetarian food. It's no Graceful Vegetarian but its really good to take a whole family out for a meal.

Check it out!"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the name...its NOT gourmet!! I've been here twice and it's essentially your classic greasy Chinese restaurant except its allllll vegetarian! I work in the area so go here for lunch.

There are a zillion menu choices (too many actually) and a dim sum menu in addition to the zillion other choices. 

It's definitely a novelty as a vegetarian to have so many choices, but it is a bit overwhelming. We ended up making a few great choices and a few not so great choices. I was really impressed with some of the fake meat dishes and not so much with one of the rice/tofu dishes (tofu was booger slime in my mouth - ewww).  I think you'd have to go here a lot of find out what the awesome dishes are. The food is crazy cheap and I will be back for lunch!! 

The key is to go with a few people and split all your dishes."}
{"text":"Went over with a couple carnivorous friends. When they saw all the fake may available, they were quite excited although I'm not the biggest fan of that stuff. We ordered one of the shredded pork rice dish,an egg dish and a Singapore something. The clear winner was the Singapore dish with the right level of spices. The egg was more like an omelette which was not what I was expecting but was good. The other dish was a bit bland.  Big portions and good prices. I will be back. Recommended."}
{"text":"A while back, I had dinner here with a dear friend who is vegan. She did a search and found this place. 

Gourmet Vegetarian Restaurant is in Richmond Hill, on Highway 7, west of Times Square. Parking can get busy. We parked further away and didn't have any issues. 

The restaurant is small. I can see issues waiting when it does get busy. Service was decent when we were there. 

We ordered three dishes:
- Shanghai-style fried noodles
- Yeung chow fried rice
- Lemon chicken

We asked that the Yeung chow fried rice not have any egg in it. Done! It was deliciously flavourful. 

We loved the fried noodles. They weren't greasy. The noodles were perfect, also with decent flavour. 

Hands down, we were in love with the lemon chicken. If we didn't know that it was mock chicken, we would have insisted that it was the real deal. So yummy! Nothing was left. 

I haven't been back in a while. I'm due for some more delicious vegetarian food.

{"text":"Didn't consider service so now I am updating. The dinner service (maybe just that waitress didn't smile at all!) wasn't too great. I enjoyed the more friendly lunch service.

Food quality at lunch I think might be a little better as well."}
{"text":"I walked in to order to go and asked the lady for a menu, requesting me to point to vegan options. She was super nice and said something on the lines of \"pick up anything and I will make a vegan version\". This was music to my ears!!  I picked the veggie meatballs in sweet and sour sause and an appetizer   I can't recollect name of. The food was super delicious and full of flavor. I will be back to try out more of their vegan delicacies!"}
{"text":"Our group came here for dinner around 8pm on a Sunday and were able to get a table after a few minutes of waiting. This place is... not fancy, to say the least. Surprisingly, there were a lot of Chinese people here. Who knew vegetarian food was so popular?

The menu is extensive. There are tons of faux meat options and many different options to choose from. We ordered the shark fin soup, chicken and taro in coconut hotpot, an eggplant and minced ground beef, a seafood congee, a fried noodle dish, and fried tofu with veggie egg white. Although the food was tasty, what it lacked was the texture of real meat, if that matters to you.

The shark fin soup was good. The shark fin was replaced with strands of clear vermicelli noodle and the chicken was replaced with enoki mushrooms. I enjoyed the chicken and taro in coconut hotpot. The coconut was particularly thick and had a very fragrant coconut smell. I enjoyed the faux chicken, even if it didn't taste like chicken. The congee was tasty, but needed a little bit extra seasoning. I've never been a fan of faux seafood, since it has a bit of a gelatinous texture. The fried tofu was very tasty. It's one of the only ways that I will eat tofu. The eggplant and minced ground beef was tasty as well, with lots of spices and flavor in the sauce. The fried noodles were very tasty and matched the texture of the same noodle dish at other Chinese restaurants.

Overall, I was impressed with the food here. The quality was excellent even if the texture of faux meat were always a miss.

Cash only."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my aunt and it's amazing what can look like meat but it's the veggie version.

Food is ok but the place doesn't look the cleanest. 

I probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"This restaurant serves Chinese vegetarian food. Menu offers a large variety of dishes from plain old veggies, mock meats (chicken, shrimps, Fish, beef) to dim sum dishes. 
As others have said, restaurant is quite dated and seating is quite tight. 5 of us were squeezed in a 4 person table at the back near the kitchen so it was not very comfortable. 
Food is standard; some dishes are a bit greasier than others. Dishes are fairly priced. 
Overall I would come back if dining with vegetarian friends or craving meat alternatives"}
{"text":"We went there as my in law is vegetarian and like this place so much. They claimed you can ask for less oil, less salt and no msg. However, it was a lie, the msg was soooo strong that I still felt thirsty 5 hrs later when I had to go to bed.  They do seem to have more variety of vegetarian dishes and with lots fake meat options such as ribs, beef, chicken. The dishes without the fake meat tasted better. Overall, I do not recommend unless you are okay with taking lots msg."}
{"text":"Love this place!  They have vegetarian dim sum items which look interesting but didn't get to try.  I ordered their lunch special item which is \"fish\" but tasted like oyster.  Inside were bean curds and seaweed sheets wrapped together and deep fried.  We also ordered their small size variety vegetarian \"meat\" dishes.  There was so much flavor in each dish and it was absolutely delicious!  For two people the lunch only cost $14 after tax!  I usually come here for take out where they have the typical comfort vegetarian dishes like fake pork, fake char siu.  Cheap and fresh!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite places to come for vegetarian food! Come during the dim sum hours for some cheap yummy dim sum dishes. My favourite thing to eat is the crispy fried milk dish! One of my favourite water melting dishes I love to eat.  The staff are friendly as well can accommodate guest with different preferences!"}
{"text":"Didn't feel like letting my wife cook that night we went out so I decided that we should go somewhere that neither of us had gone to before, just for adventure's sake.  My requirement was it needed to have food I can eat on my diet and Vegetarian nearby came up with this one.  Plus Allison Y. reviewed it so it got us interested.

So we ordered two dishes: Satay beef on broccoli and steak in black pepper sauce on a hot plate.  No real meat though.

The satay beef on broccoli was a little dry, in that there was no sauce or it got sucked by the fake beef.

The steak on black pepper sauce was much better though it was a bit spicy for me.  However, it is tolerable so most people won't even feel it.

Near the end I ordered one more dish which was some sort of mixed plate.  Some parts were good some parts were meh.  I liked trying to figure out which meat each bit represented.  However, near the end we decided to pack it in since I did eat too much already.

Service was okay.  Nothing special.

Since there is really nothing that sets this place apart which is why I gave it a 3-star."}
