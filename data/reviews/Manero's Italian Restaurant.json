{"text":"We went tonight and they were closed.  Looks like for good.  There was a sign on the door saying the location will reopen in the fall as with a new concept.  No clue as to what it will be though."}
{"text":"Big time favorite for my wife and me.   Good service and the food is great.   Try the pizzas."}
{"text":"Wonderful Time on Wed. evening when they have entertainment and Happy Hour Specials. Also, Great Table for 14 in center of restraurant in front of singer. Great time and servers were wonderful and small plates pretty good. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great pizza!!! Good service, good atmosphere, good bar. Defiantly a place worth checking out. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We just left dinner there and it was fantastic! They have a new \"small plates\" menu, so we selected off that. We also split a house salad and each had a glass of wine. My veal parm was fantastic and the sirloin sandwich was great as well. The service was quick and speedy and superior. We each had dessert and coffee as well.   I am impressed with the food! With Carrabba's next door, this place blows them out of the water. It's true Italian and NOT a chain, which is a great thing in my book. We took our time with dinner, and dinner was great. At chains, we are rushed to get out, but we will definitely return here!"}
{"text":"Unremarkable at every turn.  From the not-so-polished service to the decent, edible-but-forgettable food, this is one of those places we decided we wouldn't bother visiting again.  Carrabba's -- literally across the parking lot -- is so, so much better."}
{"text":"Manero's is the latest addition to the group of Sperry Road restaurants and curiously located right across from the popular Italian chain, Carrabba's Italian Grill.  The inside of Manero's has a classic Italian look--dimly lit with tables adorned with red and white checkerboard vinyl tablecloths.  The menu consisted primarily of pizza and basic Italian staples along with some less basic specials that changed monthly.  I started out with a White Sangria to drink, which was not that strong but refreshing nonetheless.  I followed that up with the soup of the day--a Manhattan Clam Chowder.  The problem was that the familiar red broth actually had pieces of sausage in it rather than clam.  After pressing a few times, the restaurant finally gave an explanation:  Their Manhattan Clam Chowder usually has sausage in it, but the clams were missing.  (Uhh...not much of an explanation.)  At this point I can only fathom that the actual pieces of clam were still stuck at the bottom of the Sysco container the restaurant got the soup from.  The Veal Parmesan was not much better.  The meat itself was fairly bland, and the dish was accompanied with a paltry vegetable side consisting of 4 tiny pieces of broccoli (each about the size of a lima bean), 1 tiny piece of cauliflower, and 1 larger piece of cauliflower.  The vegetables reminded me of the sickly-looking broccoli I once had at Rosie's Restaurant near Great Northern (which is mercifully now closed).  The pasta side was similarly slight--barely two meager forkfuls of noodles.  In search of something to cheer me up, I tried the Spumoni dessert.  This ended up being more a jumble of unremarkable ice cream with bits of pistachios and cherries in it rather than the layered dessert it is supposed to be.  I was not cheered up.  Service was about average for its peer Sperry Road restaurants (meaning, don't expect anything that great).  Perhaps I managed to hit the weak spots on their menu, but I cannot in good faith recommend to anyone anything that I had that night.  I would recommend, on the other hand, heading over to Dadonna's on Crocker Road near Center Ridge if you are looking for a decent Italian family restaurant.  Alternatively, you are probably better off heading to any of the nearby Carrabba's, Boneyard, or Outback restaurants.  (Manero's may have had a chance to beat Club House Grill, but that establishment is now closed.)"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! I have been consistently coming here since it opened and the food is just superb! From the dipping oil, to the house salad dressing, to the wonderful entrees! I highly recommend this restaurant if you are looking for a great Italian restaurant that isn't a chain!   My top recommendations are the Chicken Marsala and the Veal Saltimbocca. The Saltimbocca is probably my absolute favorite.   The service is always top-notch and very friendly.  A wonderful establishment that beats Carrabba's by far.  People need to go to Manero's and not across the street!  This is the place to eat if you want Italian!"}
{"text":"Did not enjoy our meal. Service slow. Food too salty and swimming in oil. Serice was ok."}
{"text":"Happened to see a review of this restaurant in the local paper.....looked good, thought that we'd check it out one night.......happy we did!!! Located on sperry road, in the middle of chain restaurant mayhem, is a refreshing change from the typical surrounding restaurants. We had a couple of cocktails, the hendrick's collins i ordered was syrupy sweet and tasted more like lemonade, that was the only complaint of the evening.  For appetizers, we had calamari and the provolone marinara....a simple twist on the traditional mozzarella sticks.......both were crisp, fresh tasting WITHOUT any excessive soggy oil lingering on the food or plate. the marinara that acompanied both dishes was simple and delicious with at true, strong tomato taste. For dinner we share a pizza and a pasta dish. We had the penne bolognese with an addtion of 2 meatballs. The sauce was loaded with bits of italian sausage and beef. It had just the right amount of spiciness. The meatballs were typical italian style, baked and not fried as they had no outter crust and a simple beefy/meatball flavor without any heavy oregano/garlic/basil flavors....simple, yet good. The pizza was the highlight! Pizza riviera....a white pizza with a thin, but not too thin, crust was topped with pears, arugula, fried proscuitto and bits of cheese. AWESOME!!! Skipped dessert and took half of the pizza home.....we were too full!  Manero's is a great, traditional, mom & pop style italian kitchen.....give it a try! PS......they had great ambient music playing too!!!"}
{"text":"Nice family place, unfortunately It'll close soon."}
{"text":"I cannot speak enough about this restaurant. The Italian food is great and very reasonably priced. The live music is fantastic. The menu is extensive and there is a good wine list. My wife an I try to go a few times a month. It reminds me how a nice NYC Little Italy restaurant."}
{"text":"Probably the worst dining experience in a long time.  Calamari was the worst I have ever had. Soft and gooey are not adjectives generally used with calamari but this stuff was terrible. Our main courses were ok, nothing special. The only good thing we had to eat was the bread with oil and spices. The worst part about our experience was our waitress. I think she would have rather been anywhere but serving us. We never had beverages refilled, never asked once how the food was, and then took over 20 mins to bring the check. We will never go back."}
