{"text":"Terrible service. Hands down the worst service ever experienced at a restaurant!! The waiter brought food to the table and handed it to whoever. When we asked who's food it was he said, \"it's somebody's\" and walked off. No refills we're given, even when asked (our friend is still waiting on her Arnold Palmer!) General disregard. Spoke to manager about poor service. Instead of correcting the situation, she made an excuse for the service, She said \"Sorry, we were busy\". We won't be back."}
{"text":"Pretty yummy! Crunchy roll, spicy beef and broccoli with rice, crab Ragoon, and two soups.. For 30$. My boy friend and I left full and happy. Service was a little slow but over all good. Portions were big, we over ordered for our first time."}
{"text":"I'm not a sushi guy, but the Ginger chicken is muy delicioso and keeps me coming back. They also have the best steamed pork dumplings in town. The place is usually pretty full, but you never have to wait very long. Great staff."}
{"text":"One week later and we had to come back again and this time we brought a friend. The snow roll is the best roll we have experienced anywhere and highly recomended by us. We just dont believe it can get much better. We've been to almost 30 places now but still have a dozen or so left to go. This will be hard to beat, but, we'll see......."}
{"text":"I picked this place specifically because it's so close to where I'm staying. I ordered hibachi chicken, no veggies and requested to pick up in ten minutes. I was really surprised when I went to pay and it was $15... I was expecting closer to $10. However, when I get home I found a nicely put together small salad, big bowl of soup and a huge plate of food. I couldn't eat a fourth of this meal by myself, and I ordered hungry. This meal could EASILY be split between two people, and for it's size, it's well worth the money. I wouldn't order here again for just me, but I'd go back for a nice meal to share with someone. The food is great, restaurant clean and the staff friendly. I couldn't find an online menu, so that would be helpful but otherwise, good food steeper-than-I-like price."}
{"text":"Garbage in my wife's beef and broccoli. Management don't care for the customers only the money!!!!  Def Read more!!!

 This restaurant seemed to be a really nice establishment, \" BUT\"! I will never trust the patrons here! 
My wife was served something that I can only assume was Someone's leftovers reheated on a plate out of the trash can. Her meal appeared to contain an earlier customers fortune cookie slip in the beef and broccoli sauce.  The manager without asking automatically sent a supposedly fresh dish of the beef and broccoli back to our table, \"Via the waitress \" with no apologies\" nor asking how she felt about the situation. The plate arrived at our table a little too quickly,\" for freshly cooked, in my opinion\". I did not complain or get nasty at this point\". With the thought of eating out of there trash cans still lingering in our heads we could not continue eating our meals. The check arrived at our table very promptly. But none of the after dinning  amenities that other customer were getting were offered to our table such as the warm towels to clean hands ect... 
At this point, after looking over the ticket I wanted to speak to the manager about our visit, so I took the check up to the front of the restaurant.  The management decided to argue with me saying that the paper from the four tune cookie was likely left on our table from a costumer before us and magically flew into my wife's food. Also, that I was going to pay for my wife's plate food because she sent out another plate. Then I replied that I do not have any problem paying for our meals but a Health inspection may be in her future. After a few minutes of the lady and I arguing she took the price of the beef and broccoli off of my ticket so other customers would not hear and still without any apologies."}
{"text":"Horrible food, weird chicken.  My fiancé got sick afterwards."}
{"text":"I wasn't a huge fan of this place, but that might be because I didn't order the sushi. I got orange chicken, and I found that it was mostly orange fried bread, with the chicken pieces being so small as to be almost impossible to taste. While the restaurant is in a nice location, the food isn't worth it."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Awesome staff!
Lots of unique items, even better prices. The menu has tons of options, by far not only sushi (although the specialty rolls are wonderful with combinations you don't see everywhere). Decent sake selection, they also have lots of wine. Really like the avocado sashimi appetizer!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best sushi in the LKN area--even outranks much more pricey options.  The decor is a little Asian-gauche with dark wood, red leathers and lots of laquer.  But the sushi is DIVINE.  Our family favorite is the Naruto roll--made with crab, avocado and roe wrapped in a thinly shaved spiral cucumber!  You won't find anything like it elsewhere.  Also delicious are the specialty rolls with steak layered on top.  They regularly change out new specialty rolls on their menu.

I've had their \"chinese\" cuisine, which is decent, but fairly average.  Steamed edamame is a tasty appetizer.  But the real star is the sushi.  If you're a fan of it, you gotta try Osaka.  We go at least once a month."}
{"text":"LOVE Osaka!!  Their sushi is wonderful and it's never too busy!  The employees are always friendly. It is a great atmosphere and I would recommend it to anyone who like sushi!"}
{"text":"Good food, good service and they serve both Japanese and Chinese food.  This means I can have sushi while my wife enjoys Hibachi Chicken.  The prices are good and they have booths for comfortable seating.  While it is not a fancy place, it offers good value.  I recommend it."}
{"text":"Nice little Japanese restaurant tucked away in the Kenton Place Business Park in Cornelius, NC. The Lake Norman area is congested so it's nice to have good food near where you are working. The food is good, the shrimp sauce is good, and the service is quick. I definitely recommend trying this place if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Worst customer service I have EVER experienced.  Our server was likely the teenage daughter of the owner.  I had to get up from the table twice to ask for items; both times she was found sitting at another table in the restaurant, on her phone and/or eating.  The first time she was eating at a table with another employee, likely a male manager/owner.  Our server acted as if I was inconveniencing HER by asking her to get up and get me a knife, a box, etc.  The food was fairly decent, but I will NOT be back.   8/19/15"}
{"text":"Great food!  Great prices!  Great service!  Their sushi is always great regardless of whether we order carry out or dine in."}
{"text":"First, let me say, I've eaten here multiple times and have always enjoyed it but they lost me last week!   I have always ordered \"Double Delight\" from their takeout menu.  On this occasion, my wife and I had a rare opportunity to EAT IN without the kids.   I ordered my favorite entree like usual and I was told I couldn't order that!  WHAT????  I am not allowed to order items from the take out menu if I was dining in!!   The waiter then tries to get me to order the \"TRIPLE DELIGHT\" off the \"DINE IN\" menu which...oh by the way....is $16.95 vs. $8.95 for the entree I wanted!!   I was completely disgusted by this irrational line of thinking and my wife and I left and went elsewhere....We won't be back... Not smart fellas...Not smart at all when there's countless choices for eating out in the area.   I guess I should have ordered it \"take out\" and then just ate it at one of their tables....makes a lot of sense doesn't it??"}
{"text":"By FAR, the best sushi in Lake Norman.  Osaka is the only place my family wants to go.  Very friendly staff, amazing quality sushi!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese in Huntersville but, you have to drive to Cornelius to eat there (it borders H'ville). Dine in or take out available.  I order the General Tso chicken with steamed rice.  I dine in when I visit, the place is very tidy, atmosphere is business casual and service is good.  Portions are generous enough where you might have some to take home for later."}
{"text":"Party of 6 and we got a bunch of appetizers to share - Couple of pu pu platters and shrimp fried rice. All very yummy. Beef teriyaki and crab Rangoon prob best I've had around here. I can't comment on entrees but what we had was tasty and we will come back!"}
{"text":"Good spot but I'm always iffy about Asian restaurants being combined into one. It's almost as sketchy as a \"graphic designer\" using Papyrus. You just don't really trust them, ever. It's like, umm pick a side and stick to it. Service is nice but slow. Their hot pot is good here with the right amount of spicy. Their sushi is probably the freshest in town."}
{"text":"Don't Sit in the Side Room. Out of Sight, Out of Mind

Used to be one of my favorites in Cornelius but last Christmas, I had to give it a two rating because of service issues.

This Christmas we tried it again to see if it had improved.  Unfortunately the downward spiral continues.

We caught a movie in Birkdale and got here around 2:30.  Seating in the main dining area was pretty much full so they seated us in the side room in front of the Sushi Bar.

I should have followed the advise I've given to so many people over the years and refused the side room and waited for a table in the main room to open up.  When you end up in the side rooms,  you're out of sight and particularly if they are short staffed, they can very easily forget about you.

This was the case today.

I came in first while my wife was parking the car and was escorted to a table in the side room by the hostess who also gave us to menus. My wife came in and about 5 minutes later, our server came by and took our beverage order. She wanted Plum Wine and I went with my favorite Hot Green Tea.

I know it takes awhile to brew fresh tea but recognizing this, they could have at least taken our order.

In the end, my wife ordered a Spring Roll, Salad and Hibachi Scallops.

I ordered Hot and Sour Soup along with Salt and Pepper  Seafood Double which is spicy Shrimp and Scallops.

Wife enjoyed her Spring Roll but did not like the dressing on the Salad so did not eat it. I tasted it and seemed to be bit strong on Wasabi.

She did enjoy her Hibachi Scallops.

As for mine, the Hot and Sour Soup was excellent with the proper balance of hot and sour.

Should have stopped there. When the brought my wife's lunch, they announced that it would be another 5 to 10 minutes on mine. At this point in time, it had been over 30 minutes before we had place our orders and prep and cooking time in considerably less than this.

When my Seafood Double can out, the meal was cold. Texture of the Shrimp and Scallops left one questioning which was which and aside from an occasional piece of jalapeno, not spicy at all.

Will give them high marks on presentation but it stops there. Poor or no service and in my case, less than first quality cuisine."}
{"text":"Horrible service today. Male waiter with bad attitude, bad language and poor service skills. Will never recommend and will never return."}
{"text":"The food here is awesome. Great value for the price. Fast to go service! Eat here at least once a week! Quiet atmosphere!"}
{"text":"The sushi is fresh, service is top notch - couldn't ask for anything more. We frequent this restaurant a few times a month and have never had a bad meal. We especially love the vegetables that come out in the bamboo steamer."}
{"text":"WE ate there Sunday evening, The service was quite good, our waiter kept our glasses full. That turned out to be the highlight of the evening.
We ordered Sushi, Hibachi shrimp, & pineapple chicken.  The veggies included a mix of limp, tasteless broccoli, onions, mushrooms, & limp zucchini.  The dinner included salad overloaded with a so-so  ginger dressing.  I wish restaurants would always serve dressing on the side.  The veggies were overcooked, the broccoli was mushy, not crisp and bright green like I prefer.  My hibachi shrimp was overcooked, dry and had a strong grill taste, not good at all.  I was very disappointed in the meal.  
The best part of the meal was the sweet tea and the soup.  Everything else was less than mediocre.  Sushi at the Lake does shrimp so much better! and they know how to cook broccoli to perfection. I will go there from now on."}
{"text":"Where the restaurant is located, in my opinion, almost masks its presence... at least this is why it took so long for me to try the place out. Sure, the property is clearly seen, but its simple exterior and lack of \"Chinese gaudiness\" (e.g. 10 different neon signs, etc.) make it easy to drive past. Inside, the decor is modern and clean, and atmosphere quiet and relaxed. Service is very quick, very friendly. And most importantly, the food -- whether sushi or entrée -- tastes extremely fresh every visit. Prices are more than fair and well justified. Easily my favorite Asian eatery in the area."}
{"text":"We went to our weekly lunch restaurant after church this Mother's Day 
They have a nice lunch special which we six couples enjoy.
This Sunday it came as a rude shock that they had substituted the lunch special with the dinner menu - much higher in price.
Just because it was Mother's Day doesn't mean they jack  up their prices.
Plus their health n safety record is down to 90.5 !!"}
{"text":"Service was okay, our server wasn't really attentive or friendly but did his job. But the food was not good. We ordered crab Rangoon's in which they had a funky flavor. Our sushi roll was super gross, the rice was way mushy, the shrimp was super fishy smelling obviously not fresh and just over all not very good. 

The other foods we ordered were not very good either. 

Later on in the evening I did actually get sick... so Over all I will not go back, just didn't seem worth It   With price, quality, freshness and to get sick from It? Yea I'm good thanks."}
{"text":"Came in on a Friday night.  After 45 minutes we only got crab Rangoon which were cold and soup was out of stock.  Really?? Won't be back."}
{"text":"My review is high because I had two of the best things on the menu: Sunset Roll and Sunrise Roll.  Call me the fiddler on the roof because I was singing Sunrise - Sunset.  My taste-buds compelled me with such joy.

I had gone to Coral but they were closed (3:30PM to 5PM) and I was in need of a fix for sushi.

On first impression the rolls weren't that large but the prices were reasonable.  I could have eaten a bit more but after dropping $12/roll on two rolls I didn't want to make this a $40 lunch.

Service was slow and confused.  They switched who got the salad and the soup by accident.  I having memorized the menu called out the mistake.  The patrons had no idea they had been switched.

On a very strange not they dropped one of our credit cards and took some time to admit they hadn't brought it back.  They finally conceded and then realized the mistake.  It was awkward for a moment there as they thought we were mistaken and I was positive they were.

Bring your own water, they are loath to keep your glass full."}
{"text":"With Osaka close by and me being so into sushi it's a wonder I haven't been more often than I go to other places.

I really love the lobster roll! Plus they have a great array of standard Chinese and Japanese dishes, specialty sushi and sake. I'm starting to notice that a good mood and layout plus some great wine choices (both of which Osaka has) is the standard for sushi in the greater Charlotte area. Is this the norm? Because I'm so not used to it where I'm from. That's not to say it's a bad thing - I really like that. But I really can't get over that rushed feeling that I feel both here and at other sushi places. The staff are friendly, helpful and talkative but I hate that feeling that they're standing around staring at me waiting for me to finish and pay.

Osaka is OK and I'm a somewhat regular customer there. I probably show up once a month and have nothing against going back. But there are other sushi places that, though far away, I'd much rather go to more often."}
{"text":"Great food, but our server seemed out of it and did not attend to our drinks like he should have. He also gave us our food without napkins(I had to ask a host), and he didnt give us silverware until after we had finished our appetizer and attempted to start our main course."}
{"text":"The sushi and sashimi is mundane and boring. 
Its good but certainly nothing to be excited about.

The service is prompt and friendly.
The establishment is clean and modern.

If you crave run of the mill sushi place in the vicinity, this is a good bet but if you have time and demand a lot more, I suggest you try other spots.  I have not found one yet in the area but I will be willing to drive much further now."}
{"text":"They used to be great. The chicken and broccoli is good but the chicken inside of sesame chicken and any other fried is gross quality. The egg rolls are yummy. The spicy sechuan chicken isn't friend in case you're expecting it to be. Just super disappointed in the meat quality. Sesame beef isn't good either."}
{"text":"Not sure how I feel about this place... I feel like every time I go here or get takeout I'm super excited and then once I've gotten my food, I'm asking myself why I was so excited. This place isn't bad but it's not good either. They've messed up my order a couple times and left out sauces for my hibachi and chop sticks in my to-orders before.(More than once)."}
{"text":"Ate at Osaka with my daughter again today.  I can not say enough about the food and service there!  I Love them!!!"}
{"text":"Worst shit EVER!!! Waiter was super rude and should be fired on the spot. I will NEVER come here again. Thanks Ocrapa"}
{"text":"I'll tell ya what, I have eaten here a numerous amount of times in the past. The food is usually very good and the portion sizes are good as well. I got food Togo from Osaka today, I got chicken with mixed veggies and some egg drop soup. When I opened the soup it appeared as though there was some ground pepper in it, so I stirred it in and enjoyed. About halfway through my soup I saw said pepper again and it wasn't pepper at all, it was a BUG. A little winged bug with a few legs that could be seen. I have no idea what it is but appears to be a very small roach. I called to tell them that the soup had a bug of some sort in it, and the guy put me on \"hold\" to get a manager. Well, I could hear him explaining the situation to his manager and I could hear her laughing about it with him and then she picked up the phone and said, \"you have question?\". I told her about the bug and she told me to drive back up there and show her because they don't have bugs in their restaurant. I said I wasn't driving all the way back up there right now but if I could find time I would try to later (what a joke, I find a bug and I'm put on trial). She said, \"so what you want me do about it?\", and I said, \"I really just wanted to let you know that you need to throw out your soup because it has bugs in it\"' to which she again repeated that they, \"no have bug in restaurant\". I told her that I was sitting here looking at a BUG that came from THEIR soup, and she said to bring it up there. She did offer to credit me for the soup, and I told her I wasn't even worried about the money, that I just wanted them to know there was a bug and they should toss the soup and she, \"ok tank you!\" and hung up.............So if you like shoddy customer service and a little extra protein in your soup, eat at Osaka lake norman. If not, there are PLENTY of other nearby businesses that would appreciate your patronage more."}
{"text":"Two years ago, my wife and I found a great Sushi place by Southpark Mall called Yama, the rolls were definitely the best that we've had in NC, but the drive was over 45 minutes from where we live....so we often settled for decent and/or over-priced sushi around the Lake Norman area (Sabi, Bonsai, Eez)

Last night on a whim, we decided to try Osaka and recognized the host/manager from Yama. We were so excited to find out the sushi menu here was identical to Yama and  most importantly, the rolls tasted AMAZING, the portions were HUGE, and the prices REASONABLE! Needless to say, our minds were blown and lives revolutionized to know that we had top notch sushi only 10 minutes from our house.

Can't wait to go back soon!!!"}
{"text":"I've only been here for lunch, but i've always had great service and decent food.  

Sushi rolls are great, even though i've only ordered the smaller ones. i could eat their cold sesame noodles every day!"}
{"text":"I love coming to Osaka. The sushi is always excellent and the prices are very reasonable. I just wonder why they're not busier everytime we go. At times there can be a bit of a language barrier, but they are always very polite and understanding and the service is very good."}
{"text":"Love the sushi!  Steak & shrimp amazing!  Filet & shrimp is my favorite! 
Just wonderful food every time I go.  Sometimes the service isn't as good as I would like but for the most part I enjoy and continue to go back!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and it's one of my favorites for sushi or takeout. The salmon is my favorite, so fresh every time. Chicken dishes are also great! Staff is super friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Outstanding food, wide range from hibachi to sushi to sashimi, generous portions, and great atmosphere with wonderful staff."}
{"text":"The Singapore noodles gave me indigestion later -- maybe too much pork. I prefer the version of S. noodles at Noodletasia (Huntersville)."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible service. Did not bring out the right entree, horrible sushi rolls. Waitress didn't understand english at all so had to repeat myself a bunch of times. I do not recommend going to this out dated and dirty restaurant. Many other better sushi restaurants right around the corner at eez and coral. Prices are outrages here, also the lunch and dinner are the same! Prices double at dinner for hibachi for the same amount of food! Sushi lunch menu says the price ends at 3pm yet the dinner menu is exactly the same sushi for the same price, hence no savings at lunch time. Had steak hibachi which tasted like dog food, so tough and tasteless. Veggies are tasteless as well. Will not be back here!"}
