{"text":"Tried Thai pineapple fried rice. So yum and service is excellent. Pleasant dining space."}
{"text":"Great pho! Tried their seafood pho (calamari, crab meat, mussels, and scallops) and it was delicious.   Yummy appetizers include spicy calamari and shrimp dumplings   Don't let the bowl size deceive you!! It may look small but it can pack a hell of a lotta broth and noodles!  Recommend :) make sure to try some of their non-pho dishes!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite place! The location and service are excellent. Try the curry noodle soup."}
{"text":"I had a very bad experience at this place.  I stopped by for a late lunch, starving, and sat for 15 minutes without being offered so much as a glass of water -- very basic.  When I finally got it (only after asking for it), I couldn't find anybody to refill the glass and had to get up, go get the jug and do it myself.  When my food arrived (grilled pork chop with white rice, a very basic Vietnamese dish), the pork smelled stale, like it had been in the fridge too long and wasn't fresh when cooked.  The Thai Iced Tea was decent, but had so much ice in it that it probably came to only half a glass of actual iced tea.  The bill came to over $12.  In my opinion, $8 would have been too much for this \"service\" and food quality and quality.  There is simply no way I would ever give any more money to this place."}
{"text":"I tried the Cantonese Chow Mein here and was pleasantly surprised. It was delicious, with a variety of meat, veggies and seafood inside. The noodles were really tasty!   Service was friendly and the decor was bright and modern. I will return again to try more dishes!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has specials for the lunch. I love this menu, Grilled pork and Shanghai noodle."}
{"text":"Terrible food that is overpriced and doesn't even come close to tasting like authentic Vietnamese. I'm Vietnamese and have eaten at Viet restaurants all over Canada and US and this place is the worse by a country mile!! I was starving when I ate here this past weekend and after leaving i thought the Burger King next door would have been better....and i never eat at Burger King!  Quite dissapointed considering the owners are Vietnamese. The only positive is that the place is among the cleanest Viet restaurants I've ever been to in the Toronto area. If you know anything about Vietnamese food, the fact that the Pho and the Bun Bo Hue broth both taste almost the same speaks volumes. They both taste Extremely salty."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were looking for a late night dinner near the Eaton Center. It was open, with just a few tables filled- probably because of the time (9:30pm).  As soon as we walked in, a stench just hit us. It smelled like a dirty bathroom and I really wanted to leave, but my boyfriend said maybe we'll get used to the smell and we just wanted food... but sure enough, it stayed through the entire dinner. We were seated very close to the basement bathrooms too... I'm not sure if they had a plumbing issue that day...  We had the fried dumplings from the dim sum menu, which came out DEEP fried, greasy, doughy and tasteless (we expected pan fried dumplings like the ones on the picture...).  It didn't come with any sauce so we had to track down someone (there were a lot of wait staff just kind of walking back and forth... the manager was just sitting at a table across from us just watching the front door. I hoped they would have a red vinegar or something, but she offered soy sauce which just doesn't go with the dumplings, so that was disappointing.  I got the seafood pho which boasted shrimp, crab meat and vietnamese sausage...it had over-boiled imitation crab meat (if it's going to me imitation at least don't boil it to a near mush...) and it was all very bland.  My boyfriend got the yellow curry which was really sweet that came with some plain lettuce leaves so we asked for some sort of dressing/sauce (we really like our sauces don't we :P?) and it came with a semi-decent nuoc cham.   I've been to a lot of vietnamese places and this one was by far the most disappointing.  Maybe we'll try other food items but I'm not interested in going back there..."}
{"text":"I was there last night, had the Tofu Krystal Roll, YUMMY!!! As for the entree, I had the short rib rice combo and let me tell you, I've never had better, my friend had the grilled chicken and that too was seasoned to perfection. I would definitely recommend this place, when I go back for more, I will update my review."}
{"text":"I have only had the beef pho and the chicken pho here. Both are very good. The chicken pho is a great, lighter option to the beef pho.  The price is $9.50 for pho so it is a tad more expensive, but the quality and quantity is pretty good, and unlike most pho places, it is really clean, service is very good and hello, it is right across Eaton's. Where else can you get pho around Eaton Centre? Other customers had ordered different items from their pretty large menu that boasts Chinese, Thai and Vietnamese noodle and rice dishes, so this is a good option if you are craving Asian food in general."}
{"text":"Delivery review only!! The Chicken fried rice is awesome and so is the Chow Mein in Black Bean sauce. Awesone food. Good Quantity."}
{"text":"I often go here for lunch. The food AND service is VERY inconsistant. Today when we were there, I had to call the waitress, who was not that friendly, to point out what was wrong with our dishes. She brought the menu over to our table to explain, but instead she carelessly shoveled the rice on the dish with the menu she brought. At this point we just had to get up and leave... Won't go back there ever again."}
{"text":"Can't say this was an amazing dining experience.  The food was good, but I wasn't wowed or overly impressed.  Probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"We usually go on Sunday's afternoons. Service is fair and the food is fresh. But I am always suspicious of a restaurant that has all Asian foods ( Korean, Thai, Chinese..)  and 1000 plates"}
{"text":"Please be very careful when you eat here and use your credit card. This is one of the restaurants I ate in while visiting Toronto. I'm not sure where the \"skimming\" occurred but this place is suspect. Credit card charges of over $20,000 appeared on my account about three weeks after my visit there. There might be a credit card scam going on here. BUYERS BEWARE."}
{"text":"My pho and my boyfriend's were so salty we couldn't eat it and had to ask for a new one. The second bowl came out and it tasted a bit better but edible, until I found a piece of hair two/three slurps in. We told the waiter and left.   ** I've been to this restaurant several times before and it everything was on par. Not too sure what happen that Friday night."}
{"text":"Service was ok and the bowls are not quite as big as the other pho places I've been to. Location was perfect, for those tourist coming for eaton centre. Otherwise overall ok experience."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I went there with my brother looking  I get that Asian cuisine fix, and we did. The food tastes so fresh and the spring rolls are home made!! We both ordered separate dishes. Mind you they were LARGE.. we were not expecting so much food. So I would advise you not to buy an appetizer due to your meal being so large. Regardless this place was so amazing and the price is outstanding for the quality and quantity you get. We both got a meal and shared an appetizer and our total was $40. That's a deal to me. Amazing food!! Highly suggest checking it out."}
{"text":"Came here after deciding to venture into Toronto, and visit Nathan Phillips Square, and Dundas Square.  I entered not expecting much, but I left greatly impressed!  The store is extremely clean, and bright.  I couldn't help but admire how clean they kept the restaurant.  Mississauga restaurants definitely need to step up their game! Service was extremely quick, and efficient but the servers were very friendly as well! They knew just what to recommend, and when to ask if anything else was needed.  Servers aren't entirely fluent in Vietnamese, but I was impressed that they tried ;)   I ordered the Korean Udon, since I can cook Viet food at home anyways.  It was seasoned deliciously! Also ordered a Soursop smoothie, and it was up-to-par as well.  My friend ordered a rice dish (can't remember what #sorry) and he said it was really good...    Being in Toronto, this restaurant wasn't extremely busy when I was there, but that won't stop me from returning! Good food is good food, no? hehe"}
{"text":"I really liked this place, Asian Bowl, for quick and yummy meal. Especially as it is so close (a few steps away) from the Yonge-Dundas Square. Very conveniently located. Service is friendly and very fast and prices very good value for $!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner after spending some time at the Eaton Centre. Location is very convenient and easy to find. The servers were polite and courteous. It was quite busy when I walked in but the food came very quickly. I got the pho with rare beef. It was alright, but not the best. For $9.25, I was alsp hoping for a bigger portion. Overall, nice location and servers, average food, higher than average price. But it's downtown, so it's excusable."}
{"text":"Good concept.  Ginger had done it but you basically self serve.  The place is newly renovated so dining area is neat and clean.  It's good to find a spot that offers fusion Asian style dish at prime location across Eaton Centre.  On to the food, it's not authentic whatsoever but still tastes good.  Wrap for spring roll is wrong but nicely seasoned and executed properly, not oily or greasy at all.  Crystal shrimp roll tastes fresh.  Bun bo hue is very different from authentic one, the broth is not right and they substitute fish cake for Vietnamese sausage, they use rice vermicelli instead of traditionally bun, I like when they add a few piece of tofu.  Not sure why it is called bun bo hue but it tastes good tho.  Pho is decent as well.  Broth light and fresh, good cut for the meat, fresh bean sprout and basil.  Portion tends to be on the low end.  The service is good for an Asian restaurant.   Overall, I like its concept and I feel the dining experience is enjoyable.  Price is slightly higher than traditional Vietnamese pho place but still affordable.  Will definitely visit again to try other items if I am in the area."}
{"text":"Very accommodating wait staff, the place itself is clean and well maintained. I had the Pho and it was good: meat was tender and broth was nice if not slightly too sweet. A little more pricey than most Pho spots but that comes with eating out anywhere downtown. Had a nicely varied menu. Would definitely visit again to try their other dishes if I find myself in the area craving Asian food!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place a few times.  Mainly as a request/suggestion by other people.  I ordered a krystal shrimp roll and hong kong style beef ho fan noodles. I thourghly enjoyed the krystal shrimp roll.  It was fresh and well made. I also enjoyed my noodles and would order it again.   The problem with thisplaces is that every time I have been there, I always have an issue with their service.  In previous visits, I felt the wait staff weren't very attentive or inexperienced.  However, this time around the staff were much better.  The issue that I has this time is that the 3 main dishes came out one at a time over 5 minutes (as if there was only one cook in the kitchen).  My dish arrived first and was cool by the time the last dish arrived.  The kitchen needs to time the preparation and plating of food better."}
{"text":"This place was super packed when I arrived on a weekday for lunch at 1pm. Food was good, just be ready to wait for a table"}
{"text":"There aren't many Vietnamese Bun places between the Eaton Centre and my workplace in the Jarvis area.  When I walked by this restaurant and saw they had Bun I had to give it a try.  To cure my Bun craving, I'll definitely come back.  It was good food with well appointed vegetables, and the Beef was tender and tasty.  As a lunch special it works great, and was completed quickly.  I will probably stop here more often than the EC food court now."}
{"text":"The food presentation was pretty good but the taste was at most OK. The desert was wayyy too sweet."}
{"text":"This place is so garbage the pho is mad salty!!! If your viet or chin you would hate it soup is so gross rice is hard like a rock!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I chose to go here because we can't get pho where we live. To say the least it was average. The drinks were amazing but the pho broth was a little lacking and the noodles weren't very fresh. As a person who always looks for pho whenever traveling out of town, I was mildly satisfied at best. Service was good though"}
{"text":"The food was great and the delivery was quick. It's my second time in Toronto and my first time at the Asian bowl. Nicely done."}
{"text":"Not sure if it's temporary, but tonight the place smelt sewage-y, there were fruit flies everywhere. The ginger beef I ordered was super sweet, the Vietnamese coffee was great. I would maybe give this place another shot, hoping that some of less pleasant things were temporary."}
{"text":"Decent authentic pho in this area! Ever since the first time I try Asian Bowl it had become the place to go when i crave pho in the area but too lazy to go to China town. Who would've thought they make good viet food in this busy area packed with fast food and pub food. Walked in with low expectation and got surprised. The store is clean, staffs are attentive and friendly, reasonably priced and decent food. I always order pho dat biet, spring rolls and avocado milk shakes, the vermicelli are pretty good too. Not a gourmet restaurant but definitely recommended. Very friendly and welcoming staffs btw"}
{"text":"Decided to do takeout. I ordered shrimp crystal roll and an avocado shake. I enjoyed it, but that might be cause I was starving. I think the price is a bit high compared to other viet cuisine restaurants . This might be cause it's literally at Yonge and Dundas."}
{"text":"Had take out of the beef hor fun and a pho set, both were reasonable and watch out for offers they display on the board outside. The beef balls were really nice in the pho too, crunchy and delicious. But they were halved alas! Good service at the time we went (9pm) as it was quiet. Also accepts credit card."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on a weekday. They had tables available at when we went at 1pm. The service was excellent for an Asian restaurant.  I had the pad thai which was on lunch special for $9 I believe.  It was very flavourful (not super authentic tasting but still good!) My friend had the pho which she said was good as well.  Our food was prepared quickly and we were out within the hour!"}
{"text":"Came here after skating at NPS with my friends and it didn't disappoint. I loved the food, and the service was freaking amazing too.   Our server was the sweetest girl;  very friendly and got us our food right away. she even ran around and looked for an outlet for my phone charger hahaha."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. I tend to get takeout here when staying at the Marriott on business. I really like the Chicken by Kung Pow and Shrimp fried rice."}
{"text":"Stumbled to this place while we look around the area for light supper. The place was nice and clean, staff were great, food was tasty"}
{"text":"This has become our go-to restaurant for the past couple years. The prices are cheap, service is fast and friendly, the ingredients are fresh and the food is amazing. They serve many different cuisines and we have yet to be disappointed - personal favourites include the pho, yellow curry, and General Tao chicken. For the price Asian Bowl can't be beat."}
{"text":"Unimpressed, but I'll shed no tears.  I went for lunch with co-workers, and most (5/8 people) were disappointed in what they had... This ranged from some chicken special on rice to a sweet and sour pork combo to Singaporean curry noodles (x2) to a vermicelli special. The one who had the rice dish was especially let down, and enviously eyed the pad thai that I and two other co-workers had ordered. At the same time, the pad thai was nothing special - not bad, but only somewhat above Salad King (which is not very high standing with me). It just shined in comparison to the other lacklustre food we experienced there.  Prices were reasonable, at about $8 on average, or a bit more for a combo. They weren't stingy with veggies/toppings, but nor were they generous. Service was neither notable nor notorious. But most importantly, the best dish anyone had there was not especially memorable.  Solid 3 stars. I'll come back if I want pad thai when nearby and lazy."}
{"text":"Despite the \"pan Asian fusion\" label, there is nothing fusion about it. The menu is heavy with traditional Vietnamese fare with some Chinese and Thai favorites thrown in for good measure.   The pork and spring roll vermicelli was fabulous. It was loaded with nicely seasoned marinated pork, fresh vegetables, crispy spring rolls and dressed with a tangy, perfectly balanced Nuc Mon sauce.   On the other hand,  the beef satay was a uneventful and disappointing thick slab of chewy beef. The peanut sauce was so dry it could have almost been mistaken for a bowl of mixed bar nuts."}
{"text":"Very good pan Asian food; much better value than Spring Rolls.  I typically order their General Tao's chicken which is supremely crispy and made from real white meat -- surprising for downtown Toronto.  Vietnamese pho and bun are also very good.  Thank you Asian Bowl for the reliable food and service; your delicious food and friendly staff keep us coming back for more."}
{"text":"Pretty selection of Asian food, pretty much all what you are craving for in one place in this cold weather,   I have a rib and chicken dinner, although the price was a bit on the high end...Maybe because it's in the prime area of DT .  I would recommend this place for a nice,fast and warm meal  The place is neat and clean."}
{"text":"Worst service ever it shouldn't matter Canada Day or not customer service should always come first. Talked to the manager and he acted like it being a holiday is an excuse to provide bad customer service so disappointed"}
{"text":"Walkable from eaton centre (approx. 2 mins) and good atmosphere. The interior is clean with friendly waiters! the beef pad tai was good and not as salty regular Chinese restaurants. As for the Phô, although the price is a tad more expensive, the broth is fabulous and totally worth it :) quality is better than the usual phô restaurants and therefore makes sense it cost a tad more. Will come back next time I shop at eaton again!"}
{"text":"Very Good Pad Thai & Hot&Sour Soup.   Plates worth the cost but too much for one person.. Yay, Left-Overs Tonight. Would Recommend."}
{"text":"This place is well appointed being across from Eaton Centre and you really feel that the servers mean well.  But our experience was less than sterling.  They were accommodating but we should have learned a lesson to not enter an establishment when they have a want ad outside of the restaurant.  We ordered the specials, General Tso chicken and Ginger Beef and some drinks.  Our server forgot the drinks and our food orders came out cold.  We did mention it to him and he took it back and replaced our entrees.  He was sincerely apologetic about it but I feel bad that he has to do that for everyone.  The food was ok but I did have a tummy ache afterwards.  Not sure if it was completely from it but I don't think I will chance going there again.    Really too bad for this place since it could be a destination if they got their act together."}
{"text":"dipped in here after a bout of cold weather because nothing warms you up like a pho. i got the beef brisket bowl and it hit me in all the right spots - savory, nice portion size, healthy amount of beef to soup ratio. not to mention, great location and, for where it's at? the prices aren't bad. you can't really go wrong here as there are also plenty of items on the menu if you weren't in the mood for pho.  only thing that was annoying was that service was really slow despite the place having less than 15 people, but i'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I got the chicken pad thai for lunch and I thought it was okay. The noodles came out hot and it was mixed in some sweet and sour sauce. I've had better pad thai so this one was okay. I do recommend their pho though! Service was good again, refilled waters and fast seating."}
{"text":"Have been here twice now, and it definitely has not disappointed. Their pho has great flavour and nice chewy noodles. Bun with grilled pork and spring roll was amazing. The pork was sooo good - it comes in a huge piece, not all sliced up. Spring roll was good too.   All in all, I find the food here to be delicious, well prepared, and seasoned just right. Service is also efficient and friendly, and atmosphere is comfortable. Only thing is that it's quite a bit more expensive than you'd find in other parts of the city (like chinatown). But! You get what you pay for here - which is quality food and service.  Would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"The service was fair, probably understaffed and the waiters looked so tired carrying food around. The food is pretty good,   I asked for beef pho and I got pieces of pork belly which I didn't say anything because I didnt mind. The broth was okay, but not nearly hot enough to cook the bean sprouts.  Spring roll was pretty good. They seemed fresh.  The price was really cheap for a Toronto owned restaurant especially at a location at yonge. This restaurant does satisfy my cravings so I will come back again."}
{"text":"2.5 review.   First impressions: modern, trendy decorn clean, good variety and seemed like food would be good. Food is good but....   But service was terrible.  In a nutshell, we were there for over an hour, and sooo many things went wrong.  Pros: - good clean atmosphere - friendly staff - seems to have very good takeout and delivery business (I tried it before, and it was good) - recommended dishes based on our order (I wanted crispy beef and my boyfriend wanted general tao chicken, but he recommeded the pad thai as they were similar flavours) - large portions and food was pretty good - lots of variety on menu  Cons: - very disorganized (we got served by three different people, including the manager) - lots of walking back and forth empty handed - when we asked our server what a certain dish meant, he didn't know and had to ask - the server was holding onto the back of this chair where my bf hung his leather jacket (I.e touching it with greasy hands)  - we ordered tea, an appetizer and main dishes. after waiting 20 mins Apps and Mains came together, and Tea came later only after I said something  - asked for hot water in the teapot, and they forgot - server came over to ask us how things are only after 20 mins and when we pretty much finished our meal  - benches need cushions, and hurt my bum  They had 2 main servers, and 1 busboy type who seemed not to be busy enough, but made it look like it by straightening chairs and placing napkins on each table. It's a bit awkward; at the same time there's nothing wrong with bringing cutlery to the table after patrons have ordered that's appropriate for what their eating.  The servers spent too much time dealing with delivery and takeout orders, and they need to have a designated person to do that.   The more I'm unhappy,the more I notice things that was going wrong. They need more training on their staff. To be more aware of each patron, and maybe it would help if they didn't space out the tables so much (i.e. one table all the way at the end, and one table all the way at the back). It's disappointing because I think this yonge and dundas location really caters to a good niche crowd of after shopping groups who are looking for a casual quick lunch/dinner that's not as fancy as spring rolls, but unfortunately, if they don't step up their service game, most first timers won't come back.  And this isn't specific to this location, friends who have gone to the yonge/wellsely location have said the same thing.   They need to pick up some speed to get the lunch time crowd, or this franchaise will be short lived.   -"}
{"text":"Popped in for a really quick meal after watching a movie up the street. The weather was cold and dismal and we thought pho, tea and other such foods would help warm us up! It was mostly empty and the service was very fast and efficient. The restaurant itself is clean and aesthetically pleasing. The food was delicious! I ordered the Pho Bo Kho, which is a spicy brother with beef brisket. The brisket wasn't comparable to other beef brisket soups I've had. Usually the \"brisket\" is thinly sliced and cooked sort of like pieces of flank steak. Here it was moist and tender, which was enjoyable. However, it was attached to pieces of fat or cartilage which I don't find enjoyable. Other than that the noodles and the other veggies in my broth were delicious. My friends got chilli chicken (which is not battered as she expected it to be) and ginger beef (which was battered and in a sticky sweet sauce). I had a bite of both and they were really good!! I'm in the area frequently but have never been before. Now that I've made my first trip in, I will be back. We had to rush out real quick because one of my friends had work soon and the server didn't bat an eyelash. Just quickly packed up leftovers and brought our bills with the debit machine. Not sure if they experience that a lot but it was really appreciated that he didn't feel like we were being rude, that we were just in a hurry!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place was wonderful. The food, the service, location and price! I got the grilled steak with mango salad. To die for!"}
{"text":"3.5 star: super convenient location 100m south of Young-Dundas Square, fast serving, nice surrounding, ok food"}
{"text":"Good location. Food is on the expensive side for Asian restaurants. I didn't get Viet noodles which might have been my mistake. But the food was alright but not memorable. I ordered one of the something on rice.  They were really busy when I went but that was expected given the fact they're right across from Eaton. However, that doesn't excuse the quality of service. They were slow and understaffed. It took forever to get them to come around. When I was finally able to wave someone down, they said for me to keep waiting for my waiter to come around. I got one of the combos and it wasn't until afterwards that I was told it didn't come with the soup even though I mentioned it when I ordered."}
{"text":"It's alright. I had the treasures in the garden, which was basically stir fry veggies but the names sounds way better. Overall, it was fine but a bit too salty. My friend had the pho but the noodles were a bit chewy and the broth was a touch under seasoned. I would go back and give it another try. The server was very friendly though."}
{"text":"I'm sitting at the Asian bowl and have been waiting for my check, I asked for it and buddy hasn't come with it, it's been 15 minutes. Service fucking sucks all they do is stand around and talk in the back. Food I would give an ok review for cuz it wasn't that bad the vermicelli beef is actually really good along side the Kystal Rolls. But still service needs some serious work"}
{"text":"I've probably walked by this place a gajillion times but never bothered to give it a chance. It looks very Asian fusion and I'm not about that. It was 10:00 pm and my date and I were craving some Asian grub. *Insert Asian Bowl here* I was getting hangry and this place was good enough for me. We were seated promptly and food options consisted of a healthy combination of Chinese, Thai, and Vietnamese dishes. I wanted to go with pho (a lot of people were eating that) but I decided to get the daily special...a thai dish called pad woon sen. Food arrived quickly but we weren't worried because the NBA playoffs were on. Dish looked very normal but it tasted sensational. The combo of chicken, shrimp, eggs, mushroom, and onions really tickled my tastebuds. I thought it would be mediocre but it was anything but. One thing I would change would be the amount of sodium in the noodles, but there is nothing H2O can't fix!  P.S. +1 for the cute and friendly server"}
{"text":"Great place! Even during lunch time we haven't seen lineups or the bad service that other reviewers claimed to receive. Would recommend."}
{"text":"The location is extremely close to the Eaton Centre and they have a clean, bright, and pleasant dining space. I thought that the servers were fairly attentive and very helpful in splitting the bill.   The lunch specials are not particularly cheap but I would say it's better value for your money than eating in the Urban Eatery in the mall. I tried the tom yum tofu noodle soup and it was a bit too sweet for my liking. I prefer spicier and saltier Thai food. That being said, the noodle soup came in a good serving size, with fresh ingredients (mushrooms and celery).  The fried bananas (dessert) are not particularly outstanding -- the batter is a bit on the thick side -- but they did serve them very quickly. They were freshly battered and fried, as evidenced by the temperature.  I would go back for the convenience but not solely for the food."}
{"text":"Came back again last night to grab a quick dinner and was again very satisfied with the food (quality, portion size, and presentation), but the service was kind of spotty. The restaurant was pretty much at max capacity around 7:30PM, so it was understandable that the wait was longer and the waitresses were more testy. We waited to be seated for about 5 minutes, which isn't bad at all considering we didn't have a reservation. But it was kind of annoying that there was no one at the door (no host/ess) to take care of seating, so we had to track down a busy server. Food came fairly fast, but they brought out my main before the appetizer. No big deal overall.  I was really happy with my shrimp mango salad - the presentation was so pretty and it was quite filling thanks to the huge quantity. The Thai tom yum soup (With shrimp) was so-so; better than other versions I've had recently at Suhko Thai and Spring Rolls on Dundas. The soup to content ratio was ok, about 60:40) - I wish there had been more content as no way I would have been full with just a full sized soup. Also noticed that the food options (appetizers and mains) from the $19.99 dinner combo are a bit smaller and less impressively presented. My partner ordered veggie spring rolls and a tofu yellow curry - both looked really basic and smaller than similar dishes on the tables beside us. His mango ice cream was basically a scoop (decent size) in a water cup lol. Our neighbor had some kind of ice cream too, but it was so much bigger and prettier - came in a bowl with fresh fruit garnish on top. My theory is that when you order off the regular menu the food comes out bigger and better looking."}
{"text":"I find the food at this place is good, but their portion is very little and the prices are way overpriced. NOT WORTH IT AT ALL. The extra star is for the good food."}
{"text":"Such a convenient location, my office was right next to here and it was great to walk 2 minutes out to get some good asian food. If you're particularly feeling anything in the food court in the eaton's, this is the best option for you.  They have lunch combos, where you can see all the hard-worked souls crawling out of their offices on their lunch hour gravitate towards. Pretty good deal and they even have a vegan option, with veggie spring rolls + veggie pad thai + a drink for about $11-12. Their veggie spring roll was absolutely BOMB. Crispy and fresh, and I definitely wanted more than one. DAMN, GIVE ME 2 NEXT TIME! The veggie pad thai tasted good at the time but gaaad damn, was it ever packed with msg. I literally sat at my computer for the next 4 hours and gulped down about 7 glasses of water because I was soooOoooOo thirsty and trust me when I say, I'm never sensitive to msg.. pls, I'm asian.   Sigh, I don't think I'd get the pad thai again but I'll try their curry noodles next time since everyone says it's great!"}
{"text":"In such a prime location I knew that I would be paying more than I usually do for a bowl of pho but one has to think of how usually dinghy-looking cheap pho places are. This place is practially right in Yonge-Dundas Square, looks crisp and clean and when looking at the menu, is actually not that bad pricing wise. Service was kind and attentive (also not something one usually experiences at more \"authentic\" Asian places).   I ordered a regular sized pho with some deep fried wontons. Pho hit the spot (my first this winter season so far yum). My only qualm was that the deep fried wontons were a bit overcooked (there was a very subtle burnt taste on the wonton wrap) but that didn't stop me from eating them all.   I'd definitely recommend it for anyone who isn't feeling like greasy fast food in the area. I would also probably return because unfortunately I find myself in this congested area more often than I'd like to be."}
{"text":"Not a bad location to visit for lunch. They offer a selection of Chinese and Vietnamese  dishes and were priced reasonably well. I order the Pho which wasn't bad at all.  Overall, a nice alternative to the Eaton Centre food court."}
{"text":"Very clean place. Courteous staff. Had the Beef Dac Biet. It needed more vegetables and beef. The soup flavor was ok. I liked the tripe and beef tendon. This place doesn't compare to the Boston and New York Pho places."}
{"text":"My odyssey for good Vietnamese salad rolls has taken me a lot of places.  And I was surprised when a very commercial-looking spot right at Yonge & Dundas hit the mark.   I'll be honest, I literally haven't ordered a single other thing off their menu (I'll update this if I do), but the great service I've gotten has certainly warranted a positive review. Plus the salad rolls (and more importantly, their peanut sauce) are awesome!  UPDATE: I've ordered a few other things on the menu now. Their Pho is always fantastic, and very hearty. And they offer lunch dishes (often rice) that are excellent too.  Not just a one trick pony, this one."}
{"text":"My friends and I were in the area and looking for a place to get some dinner. We all ordered the dinner combo which was an appetizer, main course and desert for about $25. I ordered the thai yellow curry and at first I felt like I got ripped off because the curry came in a small square bowl with rice and some veggies while all of my friends got huge bowls of noodles. However I found that even though it was small, it was actually very filling when you mix the rice and curry together -- I was actually struggling to finish! My friends and I all agreed that we actually liked the yellow curry the best so that's my recommendation :) I also ordered a thai iced tea which tasted similar to chinese milk tea but with a stronger tea and sugar flavour. Definitely check this place out if you're in the area and looking for dinner!"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend have come here often. The food can take a long time during lunch sometimes but the service is good. We had this one server a couple times and every time we come in she remember us which i like. Its a small place but its busy and comfortable. The food never fails to impress me, then again i only get pad thia there cause i really like it. It really convenient because its right on queen st for if you need a quick bite of asian flavour lol."}
{"text":"This is where we ended up for lunch yesterday.  Their lunch selection is good value (all combos were less than $10 and included some app, a main, and a drink.  There wasn't a line when we got there, so we were seated quickly.  The service was a bit slow, my friend wanted hot sauce and had to ask 4 times...but I think the lunch crowds are overwhelming for the staff at this place.  I ordered the pad thai - it was a bit too mushy for my liking (super over cooked mushy noodle-y mess), the veggie spring rolls were good.  My friend ordered pho - which she liked, she said she said she was hungry after (but she's also pregnant).  On the plus side, this place is clean.  The table next to us ordered some mango salad and some rice dish, which looked better than what I had...so maybe next time..."}
{"text":"Great place to eat GREAT BROTH Amazing Pho Super friendly Sink in bathroom is annoying cause it sprays up at you if you turn it too high, but otherwise quaint!  5 STARS...."}
{"text":"Why do people dislike this place so much? The location is prime and the prices are cheap. The portions for their Pho bowls are massive and satisfying for most of my friends!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with friends after an evening walk around the city. This place was packed. They had pineapple chicken and vermicelli with grilled chicken on special so we ordered that. The pineapple chicken was so so. The chicken on vermicelli tasted good but the overall dish was quite average. Service was attentive. Not sure I would come back anytime soon, given that there are other better choices around."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on a Friday. The restaurant is a lot bigger than it looks from the outside. We were a group of 10 and we were in and out within an hour. We were seated immediately. Service was really quick. The server took our order within 5 minutes and the food came maybe another 5 minutes later. I ordered a vegetarian pad thai with spring rolls. It was a lunch special for $11.50. The portions are big and I could not finish my meal."}
{"text":"Ordered a Pad See Ew for take out. First of all, it is completely inauthentic. The recipe does not call for black pepper, but they put it anyway... and lots of it. It was so peppery I could not eat the dish. I would not be coming back and would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"The worst service ever. These people don't know how to handle a lunch rush. Waiting in line to get seated then waiting again for a table to be cleaned. Wrong table cleaned. Then waiting again for someone to clean the right table. Unacceptable service In downtown toronto."}
{"text":"Sorry to say it, but don't waste your time with this place. Everything was overcooked and bland. Nothing tasted fresh and I was overall disappointed."}
{"text":"Pho is definitely my go-to soul food so I can be a bit particular about it at times but Asian Bowl has made the list. I get the \"noodles only\" because at one point, I realized that I don't really enjoy the meat in phos (in general) but don't let that fool you because I always come out full! Asian Bowl is conveniently located in downtown close to the TTC and main attractions, price point is pretty reasonable (usually $10 and up), broth has a unique aroma, which I don't mind, and good portion! I would definitely come back sometime soon."}
{"text":"Surprisingly... unbad.  Like come on, you put a nicely appointed 'pan Asian' joint named 'Asian Bowl' across the street from Eaton Centre?  It pretty much sound and looks like a Westernized (read: 'weakened') noodle joint for round-eye tourists and college freshmen.  However, I was really fiending for pho (which happens often) in an area devoid of good Vietnamese food.  There's Ginger (shudder) up the street and there's Pho Orchid on Dundas and University -- which is pretty good, but was too far for me to walk to in sub-zero temperature.  So, we acquiesced and settled for Asian Bowl.  Unlike Ginger, they actually do it proper-like - we got bean sprouts, mint leaves and lime for our pho.  Price was pretty similar to Viet joints in less expensive areas as well.  As I said, not bad - but nothing special.  However, this is a good reprieve from all the hamburgers, fried chicken, burritos, etc. mega-chains in the area."}
{"text":"Came during a random weekday for lunch and had a thai curry with chicken that was on special. Their menu is very expansive and spans from Vietnamese, Chinese, Thai to Japanese cuisine. I would suggest coming with a specific dish in mind because decision making begins to be an issue with so much choice.   The curry chicken was good, portion size was perfect for a lunch without causing a food coma afterwards. Everyone around the table was pleased with their choices (pho, bun, etc.) A good place for a group lunch when everyone wants 'Asain' but can't decide on a specific cuisine. Just make a reservation beforehand to get a table!"}
{"text":"Decent selections of Vietnamese, Thai, and Chinese food at reasonable prices.  I would highly recommend they change they try to space out the tables a bit more so that way, it would sustain a level of privacy among each groups of people dining.  I had the unfortunate incident of some other patron sharing a booth table right next to us with his group and as he got up, his moronic control panel also known as his brain could not control his body from knocking into ours causing our soup bowls to spill."}
{"text":"The restaurant provides a good alternative to food court offerings if you want to take a break from shopping for a light meal.  The menu offers a variety of mosly Chinese and Vietnamese noodole and rice dishes / bowls and several snack choices.  I had the Pho Dac Biet with rare beef, well done beef brisket, tendon, tripe and beef balls and a glass of iced Vietnamese coffee with condensed milk.  The soup was not stellar in terms of flavour but they don't skim on the ingredients and prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"We were very happy. This one of the better, and cheaper, dinners we had during our week's vacation in Toronto. I got the pho, which was as good as or better than what I'm used to at my favorite place back home. The kids got Bun Bo Hue, which is their favorite. They didn't think it was as good, but not bad -- I think it was mostly just different than what they're used to, not bad."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant for dinner on a Tuesday night because it's right next door to the Cannon Theatre.  I had Billy Elliott tickets and I needed something fast/close for dinner.  The food was served incredibly fast, which was good, but it was so mediocre that I will never go again.  The vegetables in our dishes were all really fresh and lovely looking, but the sauce and flavouring totally ruined it.   My boyfriend had Pad Thai and the sauce was so icky sweet it was more like dessert than an entre.  Other than the sweetness it had no flavour.  I had tofu and veggies with Schezuan sauce and again it was just blah.  It had a bit of heat to it but other than than pretty much zero flavour. They had a good thing going with the speed and quality of service and the freshness of ingredients, but they totally ruined it during the flavouring stage. Bleh."}
{"text":"First review of 2015! The Padthai was not tasted like what I expected, but It was good as well. Interior is pretty cleaning and have huge space to enjoy food. Pho was also nice!"}
{"text":"Just a one size fits all, with Chinese, Thai and Vietnamese cuisines under one roof.  With a bunch of us, it was simple and easy, against our better judgement.  Nothing good or bad, just bleh.  Pho lacked taste, and actually the green curry was on the higher end, and average.  No WiFi, no Amex so you won't see me running back here haha.  But it is clean and crisp, contemporary decor with the baby blue seats and wooden tables."}
{"text":"Food wise, it was just alright. The foods that I've tried were decent, but doesn't have any taste of authenticity; not to mention their prices were high relative to what their food delivers.   Service was good though, and atmosphere was nice and clean. If you were looking for an authentic-Viet feeling, I wouldn't recommend this restaurant at all. Too westernized, both food and design. However, if your looking for decent mix of Viet, Thai, and Chinese food that have more of a western taste, go for it. The food's not bad, with good service, and clean and tidy environment that also spacious."}
{"text":"It's a nice place in downtown next to Eaton centre. The food is delicious. My girlfriend really likes padthai from this restaurant. We almost come here to have dinner every week. Today as every week, we went there to have a dinner, i ordered one pho special, and one padthai beef for my gf. But padthai did not taste like everytime. It was so sour and salty that my gf even cannot eat one piece. I called server and told him it was not like everytime we ordered. And what I got was, he said \"it still has the same recipe, what i supposed to do\" After that, he asked to give him a sec. He came back AND DIDN'T SAY SORRY. He just said \"The kitchen can make another dish.\" And totally not different with the old one. Very disappointed. Bad service Pict 1 : old one Pict 2 : new one"}
{"text":"We went there after a show at Ed Mirvish theatre at 10:00pm. They have a vast menu that will satisfy your Viet, Chinese and Thai food cravings.   We had a special beef Pad Thai and a wonton soup. Nothing special, but the portions were giant. The Pad Thai is well-seasoned and the wonton soup was delicious, with lots of garlic.   The sodium level was definitely high, as I drank quite a bit of water afterwards. But then again, that applies to a lot of restaurants. I would go back again for a quick, delicious and cheap Thai or Viet, or Chinese food."}
{"text":"I'm actually quite fond of Asian Bowl. I've dined inside and also ordered delivery from them, and I had good experiences with both. They're more of a casual fusion restaurant and their main dishes are pretty solid!  I'm not particularly fond of their appetizers- the Golden Fried Wontons are really dry and flavourless, and the Chicken Lettuce Wrap is pretty awesome except it contains celery, carrots and pepper, which I detest. The salad is also rather sad and nothing to report about, so I recommend just ignoring those choices.   I really like their curry though! Their curry is always rather sweet with lots of coconut milk which I love! A favourite of mine would be Bun Cari Ga, which is yellow curry soup with vermicelli. It says 'spicy' but it's really not, just warm and delicious. You should also make your own pot of rice and drizzle the curry on top afterwards. They also have red and green curry, which are fragrant and mildly sweet options as well.   i prefer delivery- it says on their website that delivery takes around 70 minutes, but my order came in around half an hour. Would definitely order from them again, if only for their entrées."}
{"text":"My husband and I are always looking for fresh, quality delivery food the odd night we are too lazy to cook. Finally we have found a place we can order from again and again! The vegetables in all the dishes were fresh and crunchy, portions were good and you can really taste that the food is not scooped from a vat. We are willing to pay the price for properly made food so the price is perfect considering the quality! Highly recommend to any food snob!"}
{"text":"Good location! The food is okay. The servers are great and helpful. Ordered chicken noodle soup. It came with a small bowl."}
{"text":"The Pad Thai was pretty bad if I'm being honest. When it got to me, it looked like it has been sitting underneath a heat lamp. I was dry around the edges, hardened which was not what I would call fresh. The taste was probably one of the lowest tiers of pad thai I've had in my life.   I do like their bahn mi sandwiches though. They weren't the best I've had but they weren't expensive and was enjoyable enough. Wouldn't come back if I'm ever in the area again wouldn't recommend the place."}
{"text":"The first time we ordered delivery from here, they forgot one of our dishes and had to return with it long after we had finished eating.  The second time we tried it, the other night, we waited for 2 hours for delivery. We were close to knawing our arms off by then! I was promised a manager would call me back, but I've heard nothing. The food was good, once delivered, but it's definitely not worth the hassle and the wait.  We won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and it's one of my favorite! Delicious food and quick service. A great place to stop by for lunch. Would totally recommend."}
{"text":"Although Yonge-Dundas square is one of the highest areas for tourist traffic, I don't find there to be many great food options within 10 minutes walking. If I'm hungry in this area, I'm satisfied that Asian Bowl is the best option around (I wouldn't even consider Ginger as an option...) Although pricey for a bowl of pho, around 9-10$, the flavors are a sure way to cure a craving. A good ratio of meat and noodles, and the interior is nicer than the average asian food restaurant.  I've also tried the mango salad, which a good snack, but has a bit more vegetables than I like in my mango salad. The salad rolls here are also good. Many of the reviews say that service is inconsistent. I've been here maybe 5 times or more, and I don't recall having too much trouble with service. Maybe for such a pricey bowl of noodles, service could be more attentive, but I don't have the highest expectations for any pho joint."}
{"text":"I'd say this is the best pho in the vicinity. Also, the crab claw appetizer is to die for. The brisket was a huge piece, not what I was expecting but still good. I wouldn't say this is \"authentic\" but it is really good and clean and has a good selection of food. I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"Service rapide et efficace. Menu pléthorique. Bonne qualité sans être exceptionnelle. Prix correct.  On en sort jamais déçu ni chamboulé. Une valeure sûre"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I come here at least once a week/once every two weeks during my lunch break at work.   The food is always on point and you honestly can't beat the price given its location. Always look out for their daily deals as it is always a yummy dish for under $10, and they don't skimp out on the portion size.   Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I always come here when I'm downtown near the eaton centre. Love their chicken on rice !   Their grilled chicken on rice is the most underrated dish in this restaurant, pairing it with fish sauce is extremely tasty, best chicken in Toronto. The pho here does not have the strongest flavour, but it is still pretty good. If you're a big eater, then you should get the super bowl (+$2)   The golden soft shell crab is a must try. It's crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. This is one of my favourite places for soft shell crab.   The tom yum soup here is not that great. It's really really sour. All I can taste is sourness. It overpowers the tom yum taste."}
{"text":"I have been a regular here for a few years. I come here because it's the only decent Pho restaurant in the area. The service is always very good. It seems they have many new servers as well. I only ever order P01. It's beef, rare beef, tripe, tendon and ball. My favourite. Every time I return, it seems they put less and less tendon and tripe in it. I figured it's because it may be expensive, so I never made a thing out of it. Today, there was only meat and a ball.  I told the server and she quickly went to the kitchen to tell the cook. She brought back a small soup bowl with two small pieces of tripe and a small piece of tendon. The restaurant has gone from above average to average. Quality is good, but the neglect of two main ingredients makes me wonder are they trying to pull the wool over our eyes. I will return again with hopes it was simply a fluke, as the food is still very yummy.  Updated: changed stars to 3 stars from 4. This place is really slipping. They brought out 4 small old browned basil leaves for my Pho. It smells like bathroom disinfecting scent, and there is no music, so there is no ambience. So sad because I used to really like this place."}
{"text":"I come here a lot! They have a very flavourful Tom yum soup, and a variety of other spice Thai style soups for reasonable prices. I would advise to come between 11-4pm for their lunch menu. I had the Tom Kai coconut soup with chicken, great portions of real chicken slices. The General Tso chicken is lightly deep fried and has a very delicious sauce that is both tangy and sweet, unlike the usual Chinese style. Great portions!"}
{"text":"One of my fellow Yelper friends recently did a review on this restaurant, and as I work at King and Church and have had little luck at finding quality places to have lunch in this area, I decided to take a 10 minute walk north west and have a lunch here.  The décor is simple, the restaurant is very clean and the servers are very attentive.  Yes the pricing is a little higher than you would expect to pay in Chinatown for similar food items but they do have some very good lunch specials in the $8 to $12 range.  I went with the Wonton soup and Crispy Beef Combo. The wonton soup broth was very good and not overly salty and the wonton was very fresh tasting. The crispy beef was a little on the sweet side but that actually had a very good side effect on the bed of rice that it was served on.  Although its a smaller place, there are quite a few 'comfort Asian foods' on the menu, and even during the busy lunch time period, the service was fast and wait times for food were very good, and when you are on the clock downtown, this is very important.  If you work in this area, its definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Found this plastic from the Pho that i got. Did not apologize to me once. I brought my own smoked chicken breast (totally recognizable) and put it in my pho before i found the plastic. Ask them for a new one and they brought me a \"new bowl\" with my chicken breast inside. Got a feedback that they never reused the food without a single apologize. Thanks for your service."}
{"text":"A good menu list and location. Friendly waiters. Food is OK, although a little bit too bland in my opnion (spicy/hot enough yes, but they should add more or at least as much of cilantro and/or other flavours when it is listed in the recipe). It tastes like they want to spare their spices or are in shortage. Same if you ask for Hoysin sauce or another sauce. You will get it quickly, but in a very tiny cup.  I could have given 4/5 for the food, but as soon as 3 tables over the 25 or so in the place are occupied around you, especially by (just) a little bit noisy people, you can not hear anything anymore of your conversation with your mate or friends and just want to run out and away of the place to have some mind and ear rest (Yonge street noise is so good and smooth when you go out from there)."}
{"text":"Worst Vietnamese food ever!  Leaves you thirsty and wanting never to do it again. The meat was subpar. The service was well let's face it, not appropriate for a sit down setting."}
{"text":"First time coming here with my partner. We both order a bowl of pho (around $9). It tasted 7/10, decent. The interior was kept clean and our server was very polite.   The only problem we had was that experiencing stomach aches after our meal. We both had it right after the pho. I can't be certain if it was the food or just coincidental but makes me a little weary to go back.  I'd probably come here as last resort because it's the closest pho place that's walking distance from home."}
{"text":"We were looking for a restaurant that was open late to grab a bite at. We were greeted and seated right away. It took quite some time to get two glasses of water despite it not being busy. We noticed how expensive the food is here as well. 4.50 for four pieces of har kow, 4.50 for four pieces of siu mai, and 3.50 each for each piece of crab claw. The pho we ordered was over $9. And a Thai Thea I believe was around 3.50! Our waitress forgot about my Thai tea, and I had to remind her about it. Service was poor because they would not refill my bf's water right away nor did they clear plates from our table even though I stacked them at the edge of the table. Small fruit flies started to hover over our food and the whole meal was us swatting them away due to the accumulated dishes. As for the food, I felt like it was decent but did not blow me away. I felt the pho was under seasoned."}
{"text":"Wow - they do NOT play around with their Pho!   I'm a huge fan of Pho, but get very weary about trying new places.  I am so glad I tried Asian Bowl! Their Pho broth is spot on. So flavourful, I literally did not need to add Hoisin or Sriracha.  I am blown away.    Portions are fairly large - I had tons of noodles left over, but I secretly wished I could go back for seconds of that broth!!  Really great location downtown (walking distance to a lot of businesses) and they were not that busy at all during the lunch rush.    HIGHLY recommend!"}
{"text":"Pretty average food. Ordered red curry it was ok. Chicken had no flavour but the sauce was good. $6 martinis were a bonus. Service was quick but it wasnt super friendly or efficient"}
{"text":"Been a regular here since my high school days. This place is still one of my favourite pho restaurants in toronto. I feel that their pho is extremely delicious, the broth is full of flavour. Portion size is okay, it would have been better if there was more meat. But overall i would extremely recommend people to order the pho.  Sometimes i order the grilled chicken on rice, this ones is also one of my favourite dish. The chicken is really well marinated and flavourful.   As for appitizers, i sometimes get the satay chicken skewers, as for the beef skewers, they aren't as good. They are on the chewier side. Sometimes i get the softshell crab. It is also really good here. The batter around the crab is nicely proportioned, its not too thick.  I've also tried their tom yum here, didn't really like it because its too sour.   All in all, would totally recommend trying this place if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time on Friday and enjoyed it.  Great asian fusion cuisine.  Started with the house mango salad which was better than most mango salads I've had.  Then for the main course I had the Thai Basil Chicken.  It was done well with just the right amount of spice to give it an interesting taste but not overpower it. It was a nice light dish and absolutely delicious.  I'm looking forward to visiting this restaurant again."}
{"text":"My friend and I were craving some Vietnamese food.   We didn't want to walk all the way to Yonge and Charles for some Vietnamese good, so we decided to check out Asian Bowl.  The decor in this place is pretty cool, especially the dragon wallpaper and the lighting is awesome.  My friend and I ordered the dinner special (viet 2), it came with a wonton soup, pork chop, rice, and beef ribs. The soup had garlic bits inside and gave it a unique flavour to other wonton soups I ate in the past.  The pork chops and beef ribs were juicy and not overcooked, which I appreciated. To finish things off my friend and I ordered the deep fried banana with ice cream.  It was alright but the ice cream had a little freezer burnt, they made up with the quantity of the deep fried banana was all it.  Overall cost was 57 dollars including tip (6 dollars tip).  A bit pricey but it is downtown so prices are a bit high, however, the portions sizes are huge.  If your around Eaton Centre, it would not hurt to give them a try."}
{"text":"I got the veggie delight without bean curd. They were able to accommodate my request without extra charge. The portion was good and the veggies were very fresh."}
{"text":"I'm visiting from L.A. & this place happens to be close to the hotel we are staying at. It's 4 of us girls & we love it. Have ate here the last 2 nights we have been here & we wouldn't mind going again for the 3rd night in a row. Food is delicious, service is fast & they are super friendly and nice to their customers. Too bad this place is here. I love, love this place!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch. The restaurant itself was nice but the pho was mediocre. A little over priced but it is downtown Toronto so that's expected."}
{"text":"My husband's cousin took us on a tour in downtown Toronto. We were starving after our trip to ROM. We were in the mood for Asian fusion. She suggested Asian Bowl which is a fusion of Thai, Viet, and Chinese food. The hostess was very professional and seated us right away. The waiter that served us was really friendly and prompt. He gave us time to look through our menus and brought out water.   We shared an appetizer, the mixed roll platter which consisted of Spring roll, House Shrimp spring roll, Shrimp krystal roll, Vegetable tofu krystal roll, and mini shrimp rolls that came with two dipping sauce- a sweet & sour fish vinaigrette sauce and a peanut satay sauce. The portions were huge & generous. I had the small Hu Tieu Bo Sate (Satay sauce with savory spices, beef, vegetables and flat rice noodles) bowl. My husband had the Pho Dac Biet (rare beef, well done beef brisket, tendon, tripe and beef balls) SUPER BOWL. The size of the bowl was no joke. He struggled to finish it. His cousin had the small Pho Tai Vien (rare beef and beef balls) bowl.  I definitely recommend stopping here for lunch if you're looking for a good and affordable meal. The decor and layout of the restaurant looked very chic and trendy for an inexpensive meal. Even the bathrooms were super clean and neat. Reminds me of the Chelsea scene except w/o the pricey food and service. There was also a mini-bar at the end of the restaurant. I would stop by again for lunch when I return to Toronto!"}
{"text":"Mediocre. They have some lunch deals, but they're not particularly good value for the money. Bowls of pho are relatively expensive and quite small. Walk down Dundas until Spadina for a much more authentic (and cheaper) eat.   Can't beat the location though."}
{"text":"Located just South of Dundas on Yonge, Asian bowl offers an extensive menu of Pan Asian Cuisine, Exotic Drinks, and Asian Fusion Desserts. It's a long restaurant with closey spaced tables with banquets running down both lengths of the restaurant, simple decor with wooden tables and beige decor offer a casual relaxed atmosphere.  Our waitress Annie was very friendly and attentive, refilling our drinks and clearing the table. She helped us on deciding by recommending dishes and we were not the least bit disappointed in our meal! Our orders included:  Green Tea - arrives in a glass cup, hot, simple mild flavour, with the teabag attached to the side of the cup.  Spring Roll (2) - Filled with ground chicken, taro, shitake mushrooms and mixed vegetables. Golden crispy, packed with ingredients piping hot. Simple but Delicious!  Chicken by Kung Po Sliced chicken breast stir fried with sweet peppers and onions in the chefs's spicy sauce.  Good amount of heat, fresh tasting, good chunks of white meat chicken.  Ginger Beef Crispy breaded and deep fried beef served in a spicy ginger sauce and sweet peppers and onions. Flavourful sauce, crispy strips of beef, good balance of heat and sweet.  Sides Steamed Jasmine Rice   Everything came out piping hot and fast. Food was very fresh tasting, great in portion size, very flavourful, our waitress asked if we wanted extra spicy, we said Yes, and it definitely packed heat. She also brought us a jar of there hot sauce which was very good also! Overall great meal and great service!"}
{"text":"I ordered chicken with vermicelli here. It was a huge plate with a side of greens that I could not finish but the chicken was very flavourful. I placed my order right before the kitchen closed so it felt kind of rushed but the server was still friendly and attentive. Casual atmosphere, and its great for groups. I took my relatives here that were from out of town and they were a bit disappointed in the taste of pho - they've tasted better elsewhere."}
