{"text":"We've had Pho at different places all over the city.  When I want Pho, this is where I want to go. I don't know their secret but I love the spring rolls and rare beef pho made here. Nothing else seems to compare for me.  We will drive across the city to go here for inexpensive, fantastic Pho!"}
{"text":"The very best in Calgary. I've been going here for the past 10 years and they haven't changed: delicious, well priced and faster than any restaurant I've ever been to. Honestly, when I was younger my father and I timed them and after ordering or food had arrived in a grand total of 7 minutes 43 seconds. 

Highly recommended"}
{"text":"The food here is tasty and of great value! I always get the tendon, tripe pho when at a pho restaurant they have all the right fresh herbs and lemon. This pho was exceptional"}
{"text":"Best pho in the area.   Simple fast delivery. This place is not fancy.   Some might find it dated but their line ups speak to the quality.   

You come here for Pho.   I tried the rice and bun and they just ok.  We like it here bc you eat and get out.   The lines move fast."}
{"text":"My boyfriend is obsessed with this place. He literally takes every single one of our friends here because its his favorite. Personally, I find the food to be good on MOST days. There have been a few days that I have been disappointed, but in general the food is pretty good. As a plus, the food comes out super quick - definitely quicker than any other Vietnamese restaurant I've been to. So if you're looking for something hot that is pretty good, and you want to be in and out in half an hour, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"I would give this place 3.5 stars.  The food from this place is solid. They are consistently quick and the food is fresh and hot. I usually go to this place for pho as I find the beef broth to be flavourful and tasty. This place is always busy and always frequented by asians (which is a good sign). While this is not my most favourite pho place, this is probably one of the best places in the northwest part of the city for pho.  While it is not truly in the northwest, it is not that far away. The prices are reasonable and the portions are good. I like going to Pho Thanh for good quality pho without having to drive all the way downtown for it."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place driving by and decided to stop in with no real expectations.  It is almost cafeteria feeling, just one big square with some booths on the outside and tables in the middle.  Decor is pretty run down and dated in that typical \"Vietnamese Restaurant Decor\".  
We were greeted right away and told to sit wherever we wished.  The menus were clear and simple with a form to fill out what you wanted to order.  No sooner had we ordered than about 5 mins later our entire order arrived!
The food was fantastic, fresh and full of flavour.  I always order salad rolls and these ones were rolled to a perfect size with shrimp and pork rolled up inside.
My beef pho was excellent - they have size choices, which is great considering usually the average size bowl is huge.  I ordered the small and even it was a good sized meal.
Customer service is exactly like the other reviewers stated - strictly business.  Polite but no frills for sure.
All in all, it's a new favourite for us!"}
{"text":"Hands down the worst service we have ever recieved. 

We ordered the shrimp and pork salad rolls and two number 23s (pork and spring roll vermicelli bowls). The pros would be that the food came out very quickly (maybe too quickly) and the spring rolls in the vermicilli were good. The cons would be the basic salad rolls (no herbs), watery fish sauce, and lack of vegetables in the vermicelli. 

Additionally, this is not the place to go for ambiance. It is very cramped, loud, and poorly decorated. 

I don't understand the rave reviews... but everyone is entitled to their own opinion. We just will not be coming back. There has to be better Vietnamese food in this city."}
{"text":"Bland soup and terrible service. I don't know why people like this place so much, but it's one of the worst pho I've had in Calgary"}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere, once I came in I was greeted by a friendly server and the menu had the  standard no frills items like soup and vermecelli. Service was super quick, received my food in literally 5 minutes and the vermecelli was delicious. Small details were nice like the veggies were shredded finely, and the spring rolls were very meaty and substantial. Overall great experience, fresh food, community atmosphere, cheap eats. Definitely recommend if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Very fast service with good food! Regular customer. If you are in a time crunch this place is good!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years.  It's not that I really really like the place, it's just better than most places up in the NW.  The satay is disappointing and normally I don't come back because of it, but the other pho is good enough to bring me back. 

So this is the typical Vietnamese restaurant.  You order, they bring you food and you go pay.  It's not the cleanest place and definitely not the best of service.  I look away when they bring me my soup because I once saw a guy with his thumb in my soup when he served it to me.  Don't worry, I know the owner so I complained and the guy either quit shortly after or he got fired.  

Still though, I like this place simply because their food is good.  I'm a big fan of good food especially good pho and am willing to overlook all other aspects.

Food = 2 stars
Would I come back? = I have been 1 star
Atmosphere = meh
Service = meh"}
{"text":"Once again, service was okay and price wise was good. The food is still excellent and comes out very quickly. Overall solid food. Maybe next time I will venture beyond my safety zone and try some of the appetizers instead of just my pho."}
{"text":"I go to this place for lunch on weekdays all the time.

My usual items are No. 7 (Pho with beef and beef balls) or No. 15 (Pho Sate).  The broth here is one of the best I've had in Calgary.  The sate soup here is just the right amount of spice and it is a clear sate soup, which is something that seems harder to find in Vietnamese restaurants.  The beansprouts and herbs that come with the pho are always fresh. 

The bun dishes here are excellent as well.  I usually have slight trouble trying to finish the bun dishes but its the right portion size for my colleagues.  Both the salad and spring rolls here are also awesome.  Spring rolls are always crispy and hot when they are served.

Service isn't the most friendly but lunchtime service is extremely quick.  I've been here for dinner a few times and service in the evenings can be quite slow.  Entree items range from approximately $7 - $10.  

Awesome food and cheap prices, definitely a keeper!"}
{"text":"Love this place, the spring rolls are perfect! I'm addicted to the vermicelli bowls as well ;)"}
{"text":"Came here during dinner time, quite busy and service were pretty bad and server looks frustrated. Food was alright, a lot of msg, lots of noodle and barely any meat. Yet for rice is the opposite, more rice than meat. Don't expect much since it is one of the few pho restaurant in the area. I recommend pho in the NE and SW, they offer much better service and more \"healthy\" and \"authentic\" pho."}
{"text":"We went here on boxing day as the Malls were crowded and no place to eat.This is not far from my place so we thought we \"d give it a try.Small restaurant that had few people when we went in but got busier as time went.Not much for hospitality but the food was colorful,nicely arranged and very tasty.we were all happy and full when we left..Would go back again."}
{"text":"Terrible service , the servers were not friendly at all ,i was told how to fill out the order sheet for next time in a unpleasant way .. No one every came by to ask how was the meal .. The pho beef ball soup had very few pieces of meat in the large size serving .. My first and last visit"}
{"text":"I always ate here when I lived in Calgary. Super good pho. Their broth is one of the most delicious I have ever tried. I live in Texas now, but still think about this place and eat here whenever I am in town A+!"}
{"text":"My go-to for pho in the city. This place is always packed with people and the service is lightning fast. Great meat to noodle ratio and the prices are all between $9-$11. Not a super diverse menu by the basics they do carry are delicious. The atmosphere and decor is pretty dated and plain jane but you hardly notice when you're wrists deep in a bowl of awesome ."}
{"text":"My boyfriend told me about this place, where you can get an XL bowl of pho for $11, which is apparently huge. Honestly I eat like a horse so I bet him that I could finish an XL here as well. 

You know when you loosen the noodles when you first get your bowl and there isn't as much as you thought?? Well here, when you do that you unleash this monstrous amount of noodles and shouldn't be expecting to see the bottom of the bowl anytime soon. 

Needless to say, I didn't finish but honestly Ive never seen such good value for pho. I think I have found a new definition of food coma like I didn't even feel fully alert and conscious after eating that (it's okay, because my bf drove haha). I must say I am very impressed at this place. There was a wait and there were actually so many people that there were 2 separate waiting areas but the workers here are very efficient and we only waited like 5 minutes 

Verdict 
Value - 5/5 
Service - 4/5 
Food - 4/5
Would I return: yes!"}
{"text":"Savory Pho with Chicken, so good!!!!"}
{"text":"One stop that needed to be made on my trip to the province of Alberta Canada was the necessity of Pho. Thankful as always for Yelp to help me find pho while on vacation!

Since I am doing the 50 U.S. states challenge for Pho, I might as well conquer Canada too! Alberta is my 2nd Canadian province and found an excellent Vietnamese restaurant here in Calgary: Pho Thanh Vietnamese restaurant. One of my friends, who's a yelp Elite recommended this one to me, since he is from Calgary. After 3 hours of driving from Edmonton to Calgary, I was in mood for Pho pronto. I headed here for an early dinner, since I knew I was going to be up at 4am for my flight home the next morning. Pho Thanh Vietnamese restaurant is situated off Alberta highway 2 on 64th Avenue, in a shopping strip mall. I arrived here around 4:45pm on a late Monday afternoon and the traffic was getting a little bit crazy. The overall experience at Pho Thanh Vietnamese restaurant was overall good, positive, and well spent $$$.

Not sure what the other reviews are saying about the shouting and yelling, but in my experience here, there was nothing like that. Although they were busy serving the entire restaurant, there was some waiting involved, but no shouting was necessary. I got a table on the right side of the restaurant, closest to the kitchen. The restaurant itself is pretty clean and organized, with waitstaff walking around, taking and filling patron's orders. Pho Thanh Vietnamese restaurant is located at 6630 4th Street NE in Calgary - off 64th Avenue. They accept credit cards, ONLY with a minimum $20 purchase. Since a XL bowl of Pho and an order of shrimp rolls was around $16, I had to order up more shrimp rolls to go to bump my order total past $20 for the credit card order. I was glad that they were not busy and that I didn't have to wait long to get my Pho. Driving 3 hours from Edmonton to Calgary made hungry and tired at the same time. The ambiance of Pho Thanh Vietnamese restaurant was casual and somewhat loud, as the waitstaff was shouting instructions to each other, but not to the customers. 

And so, I did just that. XL Pho bac diet with shrimp rolls to eat in the restaurant. Then I ordered shrimp rolls to go to bump the total past $20 minimum. The wait time wasn't horrible, maybe 5-10 minutes to get waited on and 5-7 minutes after ordering to get your order, depending on what you get. The XL Pho was pretty good actually. More soup than noodles, so I should have ordered extra noodles. The broth was lighter than I thought, but it was a nice touch, although it felt like it was a little watered down. I feel like, the darker the broth, the more enriching it is to enhance the flavors. For what it was worth, the smoothness of the broth, the existing noodles, and the vegetables melted in my mouth for a reward that can't be beat. The marathon in Edmonton was kilometers far behind me in thought and I was just enjoying the last bits of my vacation in Canada before I had to head home the next morning. Thanks Pho Thanh Vietnamese restaurant for a nice experience - delicious food in a wholesome atmosphere. 

I would recommend this restaurant if you are in the Calgary area and love Vietnamese food - or just a lover of Pho. 4 stars, although the shrimp rolls could have been better, but I'd digress. Pho's good here. ;)

Support local!

B+"}
{"text":"Let me start this off by saying everyone who went to this restaurant used to call this restauarant Pho Thumb-In-Your-Soup -- countless times servers have brought bowls to their customers without using a tray or finding a better way to hold the bowls -- I understand they are hot -- so use a tray.

In the NW this is probably the spot most people goto as it is close to 64th avenue and deerfoot trail. Lunch hour here is insanely busy, however, turnover is super quick too so you don't end up waiting too long.

I'll come to this pho joint when I'm in the area and need my pho fix for the day -- service is medium, definitely getting better and are listening to their customers about such incidents as having their thumbs in your soup.

Food is much like most Vietnamese restaurants, nothing special but nothing bad either -- pricing is very decent as well about average again like other restaurants of the like.

My favorite thing about this restaurant is how fast from the time you order that you get your food -- great for working people on their lunches, gives you time to eat and go do something else or just sit there for awhile and catch your breath.

Much like every restaurant I goto my order is usually Pho Tai Bo Vien, Cha Gio and a glass of Cafe Sua Da. YUM!"}
{"text":"Fast service, good soup, spring rolls are tasty too. Three bean drink isn't consistent, sometimes amazing, other times watery. You have to pay $1 to use debit/credit if your bill is under $20. This restaurant could use a reno, but maybe that's what makes it authentic. I like the option of Small/Med/Lg portions."}
{"text":"Service was incredibly fast here (5-10 minutes)
Loved the pho, and the restaurant had a great clean environment on the inside even though the outside looked a little sketch with closed blinds and limited visual advertisements
The waiters are polite here despite English not being a first language for some.
It's definitely nice that you can adjust certain things on their dishes, for example we omitted fatty flank from pho #12 and the waiters were accommodating.
4 bowls of large pho only costed $30. Super affordable and great for its price!"}
{"text":"Pretty good and fast which is great for cold winter.  I'm glad our new office is just near."}
{"text":"This is the single most consistent pho restaurant in the NW. I've been coming here 1-3 times a week for 7+ years. Soup is always perfect. Beef is great quality. And majority of the time my food comes within 60 seconds!! McDonald's speed comfort food. Will keep coming here as long as I live in the NW"}
{"text":"this is one of the best in calgary.
price is fair.
soup taste great.
busy at everyday lunch time.

highly recommended."}
{"text":"When I worked in this area I regularly ordered my lunch from here. The chicken is especially good in the vermicelli bowls! It is very tasty and moist. The service is always fast and good. I live 20 minutes away from there but will drive there for Vietnamese rather than all of the ones closest to me!"}
{"text":"2.5 stars.  We came in for a late lunch at 1:15 pm on a Friday and the place was extremely busy.  The servers were friendly and efficient, although their English wasn't that good (but they could converse in Cantonese).   The menu had the regular Vietnamese fare (beef tripe,beef ball, rare beef phò, pork chops on rice, vermicelli bowls, rice paper rolls, and spring rolls) but nothing out of the ordinary(i.e. grilled quail, banh xeo, or banh how chau).  The prices are very reasonable(all soups range from $9 to $10).

My rare beef and beef ball phò failed to impress.  The broth was fairly plain--although the rare beef slices were tender and the beef balls had a good, firm texture, the flavours were very unidimensional.  However, the soup was served piping hot.

We might return to give this place another try (according to our friend who came with us, their phò is normally quite excellent. The kitchen was a bit off today for some reason)."}
{"text":"The best Pho restaurant in the area ! Pho is very tasty. Meat is fresh and broth has good flavor. Spring rolls and salad roles are very good as well. I haven't had a bad dish here. Once your order is placed your soup will be out in minutes ! The staff is very friendly and efficient. 

It doesn't matter what day, noon till 2:00 pm is very busy. That being said the longest I have waited for a table is 5 minutes !"}
{"text":"My fave soup place in the city. Prices are great and soup tastes awesome.  It's always busy but the service is quick and efficient - and if you are a regular they remember you and your preferences!"}
{"text":"I don't live in Calgary, but was in town visiting my uncle.  He suggested this restaurant to me as I was looking for a place to have a good bowl of pho.  I got there around 9 pm and the restaurant was still packed with people.  They close at 10 pm, so I hurried up and ordered. Their menu had all the traditional items, spring rolls, rice dishes, and of course pho.  I had to go with my favourite, which is pho dac biet (special beef noodle soup). Anticipating a good bowl of pho, I was quite disappointed when my order arrived.  Although the broth was tasty, there wasn't enough meatballs in it, so I decided on getting an extra order of meatballs. This side item was even a bigger rip off.  For an extra $2.25, I got a small rice bowl with the equivalent of only 1 and 1/2 meatballs inside (see photo). The meatballs were cut into quarters, so I got 6 little pieces of meatball.  

When I questioned the waiter about whether this was a mistake, he got defensive. Then the owner came out and was all upset that I questioned the portion size that I received.  I was not rude to them. I was merely questioning the portion I received, but he was quite rude in return.  He said that I shouldn't have put my chopsticks in it if I wasn't going to eat it.  I told him I was going to eat it.  He told me his place was a good deal and dare me to find a restaurant that has a better deal than his. Who talks to their customers like that? What ever happened to customer satisfaction? They obviously do not value their customers.  I definitely will not be going back to this restaurant!!   Half a star for this place!"}
{"text":"My family has been coming here for as long as I can remember.

It's super affordable, great people watching and utterly delicious.  The giant fish in the back tank is an added bonus.  The people who run it are stellar and handle huge amounts of take-out capably.

The only reason I am not putting 5 stars is that I find the dishes high in sodium.  They are tasty and generous in portions.  I just find myself still craving water a day later.  Small price to pay for such flavourful offerings.  I habitually order Pho or the #32 (lemongrass chicken, vermicelli, spring roll)."}
{"text":"We go here routinely when we need food fast, and know what to expect. We order either pho (#15 sate beef) or bun (#31 charbroiled beef with spring rolls). The tea is on the table as we sit down, and the food is always there within 5 minutes (faster for pho-only orders) ... and then they leave us alone to eat. They are consistent, efficient and good value for the money. We joke with the guy on the till about his t-shirt of the day, and then we leave. Simple, nothing fancy about it, and they certainly don't turn us away when we walk in after a day in the mountains, which is why we land there many weekend evenings."}
{"text":"My favourite Vietnamese restaurant in Calgary! I've been coming here for 12 years now!"}
{"text":"This place is always busy so get there early at lunch time.  Portions are are large and tasty.  The Pho is consistently good."}
{"text":"Mighty fine Vietnamese Cuisine. Like most Phò, the helpings are generous for a relatively low amount of money. The spring rolls and dip are the best of all the Phò I've ever tried."}
{"text":"For some reason I didn't expect Vietnamese food in Calgary.  I just didn't expect many Vietnamese people in Calgary altogether, so was surprised when we found a few Vietnamese restaurants in the area when searching on Yelp.  I'm used to Toronto cheap Vietnamese food (the kind that one eats after a full night of clubbing), so was appalled at the comparatively jacked up prices at this joint.  

The food was good, I ordered a multitude of different dishes since I wanted to impress my German friend with delicious Vietnamese food.  The waitress lady asked me whether I knew what was in the dishes and I think she was surprised when I responded in Vietnamese.  No further questioning after that and the food felt like it came out immediately after we ordered.  Taste was good, the 3 bean drink was probably one of the best I've ever tasted.

We were in and out, it was a rush-rush kind of thing, very Asian."}
{"text":"My sisters and I come here about once a month - we used to live in the area and even though none of us do any more, this place is fast, cheap and delicious so warrants the extra trip.

I normally order spring rolls, the rare beef pho and a Vietnamese iced coffee. The soup is consistently tasty, lots of meat and veggies with a flavourful broth. The springs rolls are crispy but not too greasy and the iced coffee is strong - just how I like it. I've had other dishes here (noodle bowls and other soups) which are also really good, but the rare beef is my favourite. 

The service is decent; they aren't overly friendly but definitely not rude, just really efficient. If you need a quick, cheap, yummy lunch - this is a great place to go."}
{"text":"This place is not as good as other viet restaurant in town. Mainly the broth is not as concentrated as others."}
{"text":"If your looking for a nice budget friendly place to have a great bowl of pho or noodles...this is the spot!!  Only found this because of my husbands buddy who lives close by.  This has become our Friday night dinner out.  
You can order a small, med, or large soup and they have a huge list to choose from.  #7 seems to be the favorite at our table, however I just recently tried #23 the rice noodle bowl and it's now my favorite!!  It's loaded with noodles, veg, shredded pork and lots of pork spring rolls.  Oh and they do make the best pork spring rolls I've ever had!!!  
All for a modest price makes this a very budget friendly place to visit every week."}
{"text":"Good food.  Bad service.  Of course, I don't expect much at a Vietnamese restaurant but I draw the line when the old lady curses at me because I want a container for my food and I've asked three times for it.

I used to go here about once a month with friends and we've switched places because of the she-b1tch."}
{"text":"I convinced my fiancé to come here with me as I randomly remembered this place from back in the day. When I was in Jr high I remember my allowance would be spent here every Friday with friends after school. I loved how the broth was so fragrant with cilantro and onion. Expecting what I had remembered it being like when we went, we were kind of disappointed.

It was good but nothing like I remembered keep in mind that was like 10 years ago, but I guess I just had my hopes up. Decent place though if you're in the area. People were very nice and soup came out fast and fresh but I've definitely had better.

Oh and I ordered vegetarian salad rolls, usually I get some packed with veggies (cucumber, carrots, bean sprouts, basil, onion), and they literally brought us lettuce and noodles. Lol I was pretty turned off by that as well."}
