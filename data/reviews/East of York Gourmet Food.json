{"text":"Fantastic lunch spot with a spicy Indian twist. Mother and son duo make fresh, crispy crust bread as a base for spicy fried chicken or butter chicken schnitzel. Take out dinner options, too."}
{"text":"Very friendly. We walked past and the door was open ; even though they'd just closed they were friendly and helped us with some frozen options which we took home to cook - they were delicious! Heartily recommend their samosas and bacon wrapped dates."}
{"text":"Wonderful addition to the hood!  Super friendly and above-all delicious.  Love the flavour combinations. Shout out to the jerk chicken and the bacon-wrapped dates!! YUM!!!  Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Superb. Switched my weekly ritual to check out this east end spot. Split a couple of life changer sandwiches. Jerk chicken, hot and crunchy chicken, and pakora burgers. All amazing. Super fresh and healthy. Considering moving to the east for this place."}
{"text":"Amazing, creative, \"fusion\"-y food at less than gourmet prices. I'm totally drinking the Kool-aid here! Ash is the best and is obviously passionate about what he does. Will be coming here so often that they'll either become sick of me...or hire me!!"}
{"text":"I cannot believe that this place does not have a line-up out the door 24/7. We usually go for the toddler approved chickpeas (which are amazing) but this weekend went for jerk chicken. I finished up and ordered two more to go, because it was OUTRAGEOUSLY good. This food has incredible love, executed perfectly and just incredibly tasty. I am currently daydreaming about East of York. Please go, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"So. Good. Had the butter chicken schnitzel tacos and hot & crunchy chicken tacos and omg ... To die for. My only complaint is that this place isn't open long enough or frequently enough. Every time I crave tacos, they're closed. Their weekends are often busy with catering and while I am happy for them, I hope they find a way to scale and grow this business so I'm within reach of a delicious taco at any time of my waking hours."}
{"text":"Vegan butter chicken schnitzel sandwich with mango jalape√±o slaw and chimichurri sauce: it sounds confusing, but it makes sense in your mouth. Thanks for the totally delicious lunch! :D"}
{"text":"This was an unexpected excellent lunch. We had read that it was great. The butter chicken schnitzel was perfectly spiced. The jerk chicken was fantastic. AND they have thums (sic) up cola from India. Try this for yourself. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Hipsters are coming to east york so the kind of food the like. Look a like fried chicken without being fried. Old Indian receipts of mother with new touch by the son, the duo offer nice and delicious sandwiches. It takes time to make it ready cause they don't fry they bake in oven. So if you expect a quick fix , keep in mind you may have to wait longer. This is good that they try to make healthy sandwiches but I wish they come up with some healthy sauce that take away that dryness from sandwich cause right now although they taste good but you have to wash it down with lot of water of soda. The size of the sandwich for the price was good and enough. They offer bread or Tortilla if you like. They also have non fried samosas , some modern version of palak panneer and jerky chicken with Indian spices . I didn't tried the rest but they sound promising. The owner, Ash is clearly committed to what he is doing. We welcome them in the hood."}
{"text":"Delicious and inventive food! I loved the Hot and Crunchy Avocado. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The spicy chicken sandwich is easily one of my favourite sandwiches in Toronto. A great blend of flavours and their homemade bread is fantastic. The jerk chicken and curry chicken are also pretty fantastic. I highly recommend this place. On another note, they are not normally open for lunch hours, so just check their website before going."}
{"text":"East of York does food right! The menu is small but everything on it is delicious! I can pick anything blind-folded and won't be disappointed. They make everything in house (even the their bread/buns) and try to source as much as possible locally. I highly recommend checking them out as you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"One of the most unique locations in the city. See full video review here: https://youtu.be/brGctESZzrg The Butter Chicken Schnitzel is spectacular and can be served on a Taco, Ciabatta or on a waffle. They also have an impressive Avocado hot and Crunchy sandwich and don't sleep on the Indian spiced pulled pork. It also has traditional West Indian (jerk chicken) and Indian (samosa/pakoras). You would walk by and never know, but when you find it...wow!"}
{"text":"A small independent eatery. The owner chef was friendly and working hard. What's not to like: hearty portions, tasty,Casual atmosphere, cheap prices."}
{"text":"A must go in Toronto! The food is fresh, wholesome, and flavourful. We tried the hot and crunchy chicken in corn tortillas, the pulled pork with rice, samosas, and black truffle arancini. Everything was well-seasoned and delicious. I'm already thinking about when I'll have the hot and crunchy chicken again! It didn't feel heavy or oily because it was baked (not fried!) and paired well with the slaw. 

Another reason to visit this place is the chef, Ash! He is generous, knowledgeable, and clearly passionate about food. 

I will definitely be visiting East of York every time I'm in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Forgettable. I love all types of food and was really looking forward to eating here but I guess they were having a bad day, it was just food."}
{"text":"There's no other food like this in the city. Modern, inventive twists on Indian/Caribbean classics and your favourite comfort foods. Jerk pulled pork? Butter chicken schnitzel? Samosas made on site? Yes please! 

Lots of great vegan options too, like jackfruit pulled \"pork\" or crispy avocado. Choose your main and one of the variety of sides - house made ciabatta, coconut rice and peas, corn tortillas or seasonal specials like Rosemary cheddar waffles (so good) or unfried tandoori spiced rice. Huge portions for very reasonable prices.

The only thing better than the food is the staff. This is a family-run business and they really make you feel at home. The neighbourhood is so fortunate to have this amazing gem."}
{"text":"The food is really good and basically this is the best place to get vegan food in east Toronto. I can't stop going back."}
{"text":"Holy wow. We just tried the butter chicken schnitzel, Kale and jerk samosas, aracini balls and Crispy chicken tacos EVERYTHING was delish. Why are we just hearing about this place? TRY it! Flavours were unique and creative and everything was made on the spot to order.  We absolutely had to take their pre-made refrigerated meals to go. 
The only thing better was the service. It's a family run business and the gentlemen running the place seemed to know everyone by name. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Great food, amazing service and they usually have something new on their menu. The restaurant owner runs the shop with his mom and his wife (and their adorable son) who always greets you with a smile on their face. The food incompasses a modern taste of cafe sandwiches, soups, and snacks made with a mixture of flavourful spices. They also have a variety of baked goods depending on the day too, so make sure to ask before cashing out!"}
{"text":"Had the Jerk chicken and rice and peas was awesome rice was a bit moist  but very good  my friend  had spicy chicken samwitch  he thought it was amazing  will be going back to try out more  ty"}
{"text":"Absolutley amazing, delicious food and wonderful service from this mother/son operation. Have tried their Indian-spiced pulled pork and jerk chicken, both with coconut rice and peas.

They also have a small selection of imported Mexican, Indian and Sri Lankan pop at great prices."}
{"text":"Love this little place. There is dine in option or you can order it to go. They offer vegetarian and vegan options.

I came in here for lunch and ordered the jerk chicken with coconut rice, $10. The chicken was juicy and very tendered. The service was amazing! Super nice and friendly staffs. Can't wait to come back and try the other items on the menu."}
