{"text":"I was not satisfied with the food or service. We ordered a lot of things and only a few came. A lot greyed out on the iPad but the food never came. At the end, we were told some of the food were sold out. But they should let us know in the first place in stead of letting us wait and wait.....the sashimi is not that fresh...."}
{"text":"Had a Groupon and wanted to use it but service advised had to book four hours in advance.   Strange considering the fact there lots of empty seats and they welcomed us if we didn't use the coupon."}
{"text":"The sashimi selection was probably the only highlights of the night. For $25 a person, there are way more ayce choices. The red tuna sushi was not fresh at all. And in general, all the sushi had 2x more rice than the usual. The proportions of all the dishes were small and we had to keep ordering. Once you submit an order, it would take an additional 5 mins for a manager/server to come over and \"approve\" your order. For a light night like Thursday, it wasn't really a problem. But I'm sure that it would be much worse on a busy weekend. 

Overall, the food was not up to par and would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Excellent service!! Special thanks to our server.. Minnie? .. Lovely girl, she check out our table very often.. xtra star for her~"}
{"text":"Food is just horrible. Only thing I enjoy eating is the dessert. However, that's not what we expect for $30.
Not returning for sure."}
{"text":"Having heard/read good and bad things about this place, I finally had the opportunity to see for myself.  Came here Thursday night around 830pm and the place was pretty much filled to capacity.   

We were first in line and waited about 5 minutes before we were even acknowledged and took another 10 minutes before we were actually seated (even though there were few empty tables).  

The food flavor and quality in general was pretty good.   Nothing really outstanding but a bit better than your typical AYCE.  The bad part was the service and lack of selections.  I don't normally complain about customer service unless it was pretty bad.  And tonight was one of those nights.  Servers seemed very tired and unwilling to serve.  Instead of putting food on our table, it felt more like attitude.   The lack of selections on the menu was disappointing as well.   The speed of which the food came out did not really help either. 

Good part of the night,  was the company in which I was in.   All those things were over looked and forgiven in some way.   Just tells you how important company is! 

Will I come back... yes.  I typically give places at least 2 chances.  I can't really base this one bad experience and generalize the restaurant as being bad.  People are entitled to have bad days.  This place could potentially be a 4 star in my opinion.  But than again,  if it was not for the company,  this place may have got 2 stars only."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was decent with a lot of waiters and waitresses to ensure that you were properly served.  This is my first time being there and out of many Japanese AYCE restaurants I would pretty much give it an average rating as food was alright.  They do have something called torched sashimi which is a bit unique among all the other AYCE, but I mean tastes may vary and I do not think that it was THAT GOOD for it to be the sole reason you chose this place than other great Japanese places in the York Region.  

Uses iPad like many other AYCE so you can order using the iPad and go from there.  Also had a taste of their sake there and it was a decent experience.  Overall, atmosphere was not bad as it was clean and had good room so you will never find yourself to be too squished in, however food was average at best so unless you just want to try a new place, there are others to experience and try."}
{"text":"My buddy and I decided to try this place after we found that the Pho place in the same mall had closed down. We were both hungry so the idea of an all-you-can-eat sounded good.

This is one of those places that gives you an IPad with pictures of all the food items and you pick the items that you want. We picked a variety of items from apps like Miso Soup, Seaweed Salad and Edamame to bigger items like grilled fish and sushi items. Keep in mind that many of the order items are quite small with 1 or 2 pieces per order.  When you have picked your order you press submit and the order goes to the kitchen. As your items are sent out they items gets greyed out on the IPad screen. The service was quite slow even though we were there about 20 minutes before the 12:00 lunch rush and there were only 2 other tables of 2 in the restaurant at the time. When we noticed that the last 5 items on our order had been greyed out and we hadn't received them, we asked the waitress who said she would check.  She returned shortly after and advised us to re order the items.

We reordered our sushi items and added another order of edamame as well. The edamame arrived a few minutes later. After another 15 minutes or so, no waitress and no sushi. Everything had been greyed out on the IPad order screen. We reordered the sushi on the IPad again. App 10 mins later we received 4 of the 5 pieces of sushi that we ordered. Frustrated and needing to get back to work we took our bill without getting our last sushi order. 

I thought the IPad order thing was a good idea but found it to be a very frustrating experience as they seem to send you what they want to send you and act like they don't know what you are talking about. . We decided that this was not a \"return to\" restaurant and will look for another Japanese AYCE next time."}
{"text":"So bad they even take away the deep fried oyster.....without deleting on the ipad   
And we order alot of stuff they just cut it to half ? Lol not going again"}
{"text":"Nothing tasted fresh, the orders came absurdly slow even in ayce standards. We never got any of the sashimi until the end . Many items looked nothing like the pictures. You can do better for the price.
Warning, Tataki means completely raw here."}
{"text":"This place is by far the best all you can eat Japanese restaurant I've been to.  From the rolls to the vegetables dishes, all delicious.  And did I mention they have the best hot and sour soup I've ever tried.  Definitely not somewhere that should be overlooked!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch last Saturday. At first I was real enthusiastic because the ipad menu was cool and I love the fact that the sushi are tiny little pieces. The food was Ok.  My bf was a little annoyed that the pictures on the ipad didn't match the actual food. For example, all the ramen and udon showed an egg but none of the ones arrived with an egg. The nacho sushi used a pringle chip and not a real nacho. I also had to admit, I'm not fond of the salad/soup bar. It's right at the entrance and it's kind of annoying to get up and come back with your own food. What if a family had kids?"}
{"text":"Just like all the reviews say go elsewhere. The food is ok & not worth the wait or service. All the waitresses were rude & ignores everyone. They were clearing a table in front of us & throwing them very loudly into big containers. I suggest that they hire new staff that are friendly!"}
{"text":"Worst AYCE place Markham has to offer. Place is dirty, sushi is way over packed with rice and the servers will reject your order if they see food left on your table."}
{"text":"This place was so packed on Saturday night for dinner. It's pretty cool that they have you order on ipads so taking orders is always nice and easy. The problem, however, is that the waiters don't check on your order! Often times my friends and I ended up with missing order items that just never arrived. We could order 4 mango tapioca, 4 tiramisu, 4 chocolate moose and 4 strawberry moose for example but only end up receiving maybe half of what we ordered. Maybe missing food would be bearable if the food was actually good but this was not the case. Most of the food was mediocre and just tasted far too similar. It's like they used the same seasoning for a lot of their hot menu items. Another problem we had with this place was that the waiters simply didn't take plates! I believe at one point we even got as high as 8 plates stacked up until the waiters came and cleared that. I feel as if we should have just talked to the other tables and started a competition on who can stack the most plates until the waiters finally cleared them.

Overall $25.99 per person before tax and tips is too pricy for such mediocre food and service. If I were you, I'd save the money and visit another all you can eat shop."}
{"text":"This place sucks! Food is not fresh and not even look like what's on the order menu. Plates and cutleries and sticky and not clean. We have to use disposal chopsticks instead. Please don't eat here and waste your money!"}
{"text":"No complaints whatsoever. 
I've been to a ton of AYCE sushi places and this one is one of my favourites, and it is almost on par with Ten Ichi! Of all three times I visited here, I was never disappointed! Good food and the sashimi was extremely fresh! I enjoy eating everything on the menu! Very nice waiters and food presentation! 

Just a tip: do NOT order the chicken wings. The first time I went, I ordered 2 chicken wings, and got 4 instead. That's because on the fine print on the menu, it states that chicken wings come in 2 pieces instead of one. They were also HUGE so they almost filled me up on the spot. 

Anyway the chicken wings incident was entirely a reflection of how ignorant I'm at when reading the menu, it's not because they tried to make me get more food that I didn't want. I always have a good time there! BTW the salmon roses are one of the prettiest I've seen in a sushi place and tastes great too!"}
{"text":"8 family members including me just went for dinner. Everything are in small portion and not much choices but charging $25.99 per person. Too expensive. Deserts are looks weird, taste really bad. I rather go somewhere else in same price but taste extremely better than this Resturant. No return for sure."}
{"text":"Great buffet restaurant and good quality food. Been here a few times and the food is consistent. Comparing all the other Japanese buffet out there, this is the best."}
{"text":"Just knew it is under new management now.  It was great last time I tried.  

Very disappointed this time. The portion of each dish is much smaller and the server was not polite.  Be careful when you hold your utensils, they are all sticky! I really doubt they have a dishwasher now.  By the way,  it seems the menu on the ipad has been changed. Very confusing and hard to choose from small buttons for each category.

When we dine out, we care about price, food quality, service and cleanliness.  The overall score is way below average and expectation."}
{"text":"First time strongly feel like writing review for a place. Been there twice in total. The first time was with three other friends for dinner. Sashimi wasn't fresh (which is kinda expected for ayce); oysters wouldn't come for 1hr+; dessert never come till we left -- all of these are still ok. 

However my second time there by myself (went for groceries at T&T and felt hungry afterwards so yes ayce alone) was terrible. It was on Tuesday, so NOT WEEKEND NOR holiday; however when I got the bill it said \"weekend adult *1\" so I questioned the waitress in a simple and gentle way (since I really didn't know about it) regarding the rates. She told me the rates are different only for holidays, but not for weekdays or weekends, with 120% certainty written on her face. So I swiped my card and punched in the pw, and tipped. 

After she left I noticed the menu pad on my table and I randomly swiped the pages and found the table of rates, which clearly stated that the waitress was wrong about it. Was a bit annoyed but told myself it's okay things happens so I called another waitress and told her about this whole thing, and she grabbed me a loony without even saying sorry. Annoyed by her attitude I said I've paid tax and tip based on the previous bill, and I would like to cancel that payment and pay again with cc rather than getting endless coins. She pulled her manager over and here's our dialogue:

Manager: you are cancelling that and paying with cc right? (In such a rude tone that she surprised me a bit)
Me: ahh yes because there was a mistake...
Manager: (cut me off directly) I know! That's because she's new here (referring to the first waitress)! I'm asking do you want to cancel and pay again
Me: (-_-\\\) yes

Waited for another 15min sitting there seeing ppl getting their bills, paying and leaving, JUST to get mine corrected. Finally the manager was back with my correction receipt and the pos. She asked me to keep that receipt but since I wasn't clear, I asked if this is the receipt of cancelation. \"Of course it is!\", said by that manager as if I asked if the Earth is round. 

I paid the corrected bill and left, and I didn't even receive a single word of apology for their mistake by the time I stepped out of that place. So here I am, writing this ridiculously long post just to complain about my experience there, to make sure no one else would need to experience the same thing again.

Thanks for reading this post (if you are still with me)!"}
{"text":"This place is really not worthy. The quality dropped significantly, but the prices have gone up! Which translates into bad value, yes even for their lunch special of $7.95! And $7.95 gives you mixed veggies ok, so don't think these greedy folks would cut you any slacks.

We walked out once after looking at the prices for their AYCE, it's terribly expensive. 

So this is it, I'll never return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I just had the worst sushi and hand rolls in my life.  I would said this is the worst Japanese restaurant in Markham and Scarborough."}
{"text":"Great Service.... My friend spilt her soup, and the servers where right there to clean up he mess asap. Had to wait for our food. Otherwise wonderful Experience"}
{"text":"I wouldn't recommend coming to this place. The food is average and food came at a reasonable time. The manager was very nice however the waiters were disrespectful, didn't care about the service or the food they were serving. It took forever for them to communicate to get us tea and extra wasabi. Wouldn't come back here."}
{"text":"Location: In the T&T plaza at Warden and Steeles. Parking may be a struggle depending on the time of day. This restaurant shares with the supermarket. We went at lunch time and there wasn't a problem, but being familiar with this plaza, rush hour time and weekends can be tough. 

Facility: Decor and ambiance is modern, with clean lines and dark colours. Patio space is available but we did not get a chance to try it out. Washrooms are up to date with automatic hand sinks and handdryers; men's was very clean, but the women's washroom needs to be checked more often. There was toilet paper all over the floor.

Food Quality & Price: For AYCE sushi, there is a starter bar available with salad, soups and dessert. The bar itself is quite small. There was no one there when we came for lunch, but when I picture the place being packed, getting to that bar may be a problem. It is also in an awkward space in a corner. Would have been more intuitive if the bar was placed in the middle. 

Sushi was fresh and well made. Proportions are bite-sized, exactly what I'd expect of my sushi. Fish were fair quality, and grilled appetizers were also small. There is a good sized selection of food to order including Thai dishes and noodles.

Lunch was $14.99 per person.

Service: Waitresses were friendly and attentive. We had Jing, who explained how the incredible tablet menu worked. She also checked in frequently to remove empty dishes and brought our food out at an even pace. There was another mediocre waitress who tended to our table whiel Jing at her lunch, but I didn't bother to get her name. Jing smiled, spoke kindly and patiently explained the process (ncluding portions of each menu item) as we were first timers to the restaurant and to tablet ordering.

Overall: I am pleasantly surprised by the experience as I had expected Yokohama to be another typical AYCE sushi joint. Though the food isn't the best, it was fresh and generally well done. Service was also good. I leave a cautious 4.5/5 rating as this new establishment get off to a great start. I anticipate that as time goes by, service and quality my fall considering the area it is in, but I will revise this review after I have returned again."}
{"text":"Went with a party of 4 early on Sunday for dinner - 3:30, so no problem getting seated.  The location is hard to get parking due to T&T and all the other restaurants. 

The service was excellent.  The servers were very attentive.

Choices:  Very good.  I found the food to be good, some very good.  I am a lover of mackerel and I was not disappointed with the flavour which was good.  I see from another Yelper they are suppose to have crab legs available, I didn't see that choice, so don't know if they stop carrying that or they just don't advertise it.  I would have loved to have that.

Orders:  They were terrible at providing what was ordered.  Usually with these AYCE they will drop a few of the quantity ordered.  i.e.  order 12 get 8 of something.  At Yokohama, they just didn't fill the order.  We had at least 3 items dropped from one order.  We had to order something 3 times before we got the item.  I mentioned this to the server and was told that for each item ordered, a small piece of paper which then it gets lost.  I guess they feel this is acceptable.  

Overall, we all had an enjoyable meal.  We didn't feel rushed."}
{"text":"The sashimi is always last to come out and is always short counted. Battered items are always doubled up. Some waitresses are really rude but a few are nice. Snow crab legs have virtually no meat"}
{"text":"The service was fast but the location could use some better ventilation system. I walked out of there smelling from head to toe. 

The prices are reasonable, you can't beat a $1.50 appetizer for every ramen order. Portions were big, ramen was good. 
follow me on ig for more reviews: @gta.eatss"}
{"text":"The food was good, but the service was not good enough...need to improve..i like their lamb skewer, edamame, and sashimi, but the server never talk anything with us"}
{"text":"My First time eating here was on Wednesday and had lunch with the girls. Excellent experience, even for lunch! It was soo good and had such a great experience, I came back a second time with my boyfriend the same week! So yes I am a fan and can't wait to see people instagramming #foodporn. 

Their presentation of their Sashimi, Rolls, appetizers and special rolls were just adorable. The service was superb and quick and wait staff were very attentive. The decor was modern with dim lighting (thank god they got rid of that Kelsey's furniture) and another bonus, I must say, what a smart business decision to bring IPad menu's to the Markham area. 

I'm so impressed and will be coming back for a third time. Thank you for such a pleasurable experience. Definitely my new favourite AYCE Sushi Restaurant. 

-PCD"}
{"text":"First of all, one of the male servers had horrible customer service. He didn't seem to know how to say thank you and was very rude and abrupt when I asked about the take out menu. Also, this place has given me food poisoning as their salmon is not fresh at all. 

Would not recommend, there are so many better sushi restaurants."}
{"text":"I have been to this place 5 times since it opened and each visit is noticeably worst than the last. This past Saturday was the final straw that convinced me to never come again.

- Their Raw Oysters Promo: Refuse the oysters. They're not cleaned and prepared properly. This past visit yielded oysters that contained sand and what I would assume to be biological waste inside the oysters. Lemon juice and siracha doesn't mask the lack of effort put into them.

- Incorrect orders: Multiple orders of sashimi came with items that we did not ask for. Often it is cheap, lean cuts of salmon. This is terrible service for an AYCE restaurant as we are charged extra for food we do not consume. It's also hard to spot as all sashimi come in one huge bowl served on ice.

- Staff are not well trained: My circle contains friends of different ethnicity. Staff speaks poor English and relies on speaking Mandarin to me, the only Asian in the group, to communicate. This creates an atmosphere of exclusion for your other guests.

- Unfriendly service: There is no reason why a bill can't be separated for individuals, and there is even less reason to argue with customers who are trying to pay their share. It is unpleasant to be given the stink eye because we're not paying you the way you prefer to be paid.

- Quality of food is clearly slipping: The difference between my first visit and final visit to Yokohoma is the quality of food. It seems with poor business they are no long able to keep up any standards. Portions are smaller, dishes are clearly worn out, and the quality of food is just not there. Most item seem to taste of MSG."}
{"text":"We have been here many times for lunch. They recently renovated the place and upgraded the menu. 

They now offer press sushi for lunch. They offer a large selection of rolls & hot items. The service is quick. All of the items we have ordered came, which is rare for an all you can eat place. 


Will definitely return for more press sushi !"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner a week ago with parents - after the change in management which we found out happened a year or so ago the quality has definitely gone down.

The \"differences\" to name a few:
- sashimi is no longer served on ice as it used to be
- beef tataki and salmon tataki was not laid out on a plate, but piled into a ramekin soaking it it's juice/blood
- yakitori is not grilled, but blanched in oil - you'll notice there's no grill marks on them, but little puddles of oil 
- beef, lamb and mushroom yakitori all had a dash of spices which were overpowering and salty (the chicken and satay chicken yakitori were palatable though)
- sweet shrimp were thin and small like worms, no joke - seriously, no joke
- shrimp tempura used shrimp that was slightly larger than the sweet shrimp mentioned above

The food is alright I guess for an ayce place, but don't expect the same Yokohama of the past."}
{"text":"Yokohama is an excellent restaurant. For one thing, the food tastes good, and there's lots of variety.

Additionally, the speed of service is very fast. I went to Yokohama at a very busy time, and my order still arrived in under 3 minutes (I actually time my orders, with a stopwatch. This way, I can report back on Yelp how long it took :)

To me, speed of service is an important criteria. When I'm hungry, I want food NOW. Not in 20 minutes.

And lastly, the decor is pretty cool.

I'd definitely go here again."}
{"text":"AC is a bit too strong but nice atmosphere. Their lamb kebab and hand rolls r my fav."}
{"text":"Bought a Groupon for 2 people. Made reservations the day of. Went on a Wednesday night around 7pm. The place was 1/4 full. We got all our food so quickly! The fastest service ever! We ate mostly sushi & sashimi & rolls.  All was fresh except for the surf clam. In terms of the quality of the sushi, I think its in line with all the other sushi buffets. Empty plates were cleared on a timely basis. Lots of variety of food. We tried almost 1 of each of the desserts. Didn't really like any of the desserts offered... poor quality desserts for an all you can eat. 
I'd go back but not for the desserts. 
Gratuities are included in your bill."}
{"text":"Below average food | Mediocre service | Interact | Not authentic Thai or Japanese food | iPad ordering

Unauthentic food. Sweet and sour soup that is not sweet or sour. Lamb soup with no lamb taste. Sushi with bad sushi rice. Rolls drenched in sauce, don't even know what you're eating.

$26.99/ weekday adult
$28.99/ weekend adult 

+$1 ayce pop

Service was lacking. No smiles. Not too polite.

Environment is bright and newly renovated though.

You have to scoop your own ice cream and they're not even that good or japanese.
The desserts were below average.  The mango yogurts were like water. The deep fried bananas were over fried and drenched in chocolate sauce.

Overall I would not come back to this location. They used to be better (but I still only came once) but now they disappointed me."}
{"text":"Terrible, never again. Worst AyCE ever! Every order missing items, every order short on pieces ordered."}
{"text":"Yokohama is an average Japanese AYCE.  I dont think it deserves the 1* reviews, but it definitely has some good and bad.

Good:
- Food: variety, especially the sashimi (refer to photo) is better than other AYCE.  However, the new torched sushi is far from matching the quality of KaKa.  Way too much rice and same spicy sauce on all the torched, suggest they innovate more in this area, but appreciate the fact that they added it to the menue to keep up with the trends.
- Price: new 20% off for table of 4+ on Mon to Thurs is a good deal.

Average:
- Service: average, fast but not that personal or attentive.

Poor:
- Interior: looks a bit old and resembles the interior of a karaeoke.  Could use an update.
- Cleanliness: there were quite a few little flies hovering around which was annoying.  Paint is also peeling at some booths and need a refresh.

Overall, ok for the discounted price.  I would come once in a long while for the sashimi variety, but not a regular spot to dine at."}
{"text":"Food was pretty average. The thai items are definitely better at spoon and fork.
The experience was average but I cannot believe that the prices they state on the menu is false. 

They charged $5 for those kids younger than three when the menu makes it appear that they eat for free and they explain this when everyone is already seated when its too late to turn back. 

We were charged 15.99 for sunday lunch when it clearly says 14.99. I just realized this when we got home.

never coming back for sure. So many other options out there that these practices will drive customers away for good."}
{"text":"Saw their grand opening. Came here with my boyfriend for the all you can eat lunch. We frequently eat Japanese and have tried many sushi restaurants in the GTA (AYCE more than half the time). By far one of the worst sushi places we've tried in the last couple years. The fish is below standard quality for an AYCE place. Their sushi is constructed with thin and short slices of fish on top of huge chucks of mushy rice. The maki rolls came with either soft and pulpy rice which almost closely resembles porridge. That and the rice was dry and hard on the ginger mackerel maki roll. 

The woman who seated us (who seemed to be the manager or owner) questioned our second round order which was 1 green dragon roll, 2 spicy tuna rolls and 10 pieces of sushi. She says \"this is 50 pieces of sushi\" and while we confirmed we knew what we were ordering, she proceeded her questioning in doubt we could finish them. In addition to that, she took extra care to remind us that any wasted food would be extra charge. Horrible food and terrible service, a restaurant does not get much worse than this."}
{"text":"Are you on a diet? Good news! Come try the Yokohama AYCE!

Came here on a weekend for lunch and 60% of the items were either sold out or never came. The remaining items that did showed up tasted bland and for the price it was charging, I rather stay home.

Another avoid like plague for me."}
{"text":"The place is currently under new management so I was a little hesitant about this place at first. After ordering the first round, I was pleasantly surprised by how fresh the salmon sashimi was. It was unfortunate however, that when ordering fresh shrimp/scallops (which they are known for), they usually only bring you 30-40% of the quantity amount! Yes I can eat 50 sweet shrimps thank you very much, so I wasn't impressed there.

As for the other parts of the menu, their new \"blow torched\" sushi had too much rice, the satay skewers were decent, their noodle soup was OK, and their dessert selection is not too exciting. 

Decent sashimi and mediocre everything else."}
{"text":"My experience here has been substandard. This restaurant used to be popular but during my time here it wasn't too busy. I've been told by a friend of mine that the management has changed for the worst. Here are the reasons why:

* Certain items on the menu such as the teppanyaki cabbage, grilled squid leg, and teppanyaki mushrooms just to name a few were overly salty. 

* In terms of taste it was pretty much subpar or looked questionable such as the beef tataki, it was completely raw, as far as my understanding it should at least be blue rare. Mango tapioca was completely watered down. 

* Service was pretty much absent for the majority of my time there, in fact we ended up stacking our plates pretty high, terrible. 

* The quantity of food we ordered is always below the number we punched in or what we ordered never came. We had 6 people in total and was reasonable with the amount we wanted. For example with the beef tataki we wanted 6 orders of it for each person, we got 1 order with about 4 slices. 

Overall, I would not go back unless management changes again for the better. I understand it's a buffet and the quality of food isn't always the greatest but by my standards it should at least be satisfactory which wasn't in this case. With the addition of an absent service, it was many things that added on to the poor experience. There are so many ayce sushi in the GTA it's better to go elsewhere in my opinion or even the T&T supermarket across from it. By 8 o'clock the place was pretty much empty on a Sunday."}
{"text":"This is your average chinese ran japanese ayce. We came here for weekend lunch and it wasn't too busy. Overall impression of this place was okay. 

The service is what you expect of these typical japanese ayce's, little bit slow, and not that great. We used the iPad to order food, and it came at a slow steady pace, really slow. Some foods that we order actually never showed up.

The food was actually slightly better than expected. There was a lot of variety for a lunch menu. Fish tasted pretty fresh and the rice was alright. However, the sushi (nigiri) had a terrible fish to rice ratio. There was way too much rice. My favourite dishes were the mackerel and the special rolls. There were torched sushi as well which was a nice addition to your usual menu items. Other than that, the menu is not too special. Desserts had variety but not that great

Overall, this place is not too bad for the price ($19 for weekend lunch). Would recommend trying this place out."}
{"text":"Came here during Christmas holidays. It has a good varieties of sushi and fresh ingredients. I'm a big fan of yam sushi, and here has great yam sushi with lots of yam inside (many sushi bars just put little yam but thick tempura skins). 

The other types of sushis are tasty too. The rice stickiness and moisture are perfect.

Servers there were very friendly."}
{"text":"Sushi was okay I don't remember what I ate except for the sweet potato tempura. The waiter kept giving my brother two mushrooms on a stick and he was wondering where it was coming from. Anyways the dessert was not good the mango yogurt was a bright yellow (it tasted like lemon??) and the mango pudding was liquid. Also there was a faulty green tea pudding that tasted like refrigerator (thats how u kno its been in the fridge for too long). We kept spamming orders of this crystal roll because it never came out (but it wasn't that good anyways). Someone also ordered some sardine with cucumber roll (WHY?) and it ruined everyones appetite"}
{"text":"Very good selection of sashimi and what not.  Food was delicious,  service was quick and staff was helpful.  Only complaint is their special crab legs were pretty garbage.  This place is a on the more expensive side for AYCE but still,  worth going to."}
{"text":"I came here two times, first time was for a friends birthday 6 months ago and the food was pretty good. I came here the second and last time yesterday because the restaurant we wanted to go to was full. Yokohama's sushi has to be the worst sushi I've ever eaten in a long time. I can't believe they went downhill so quickly in just 6 months. The sushi rolls got significantly smaller and it was pretty much tiny sushi with a lot of rice. The sashimi was tiny as well, it was probably 1/3 of the normal sized sashimi. What is this, sushi for ants?? Their sashimi was regular 6 months ago and it was awesome, I'm not sure why they decided to make it so small. Why is everything so small?! Yes, I realize that you can just order more but who wants to eat tiny sashimi? 

Their miso soup was disgustingly salty...how do you even manage to mess up miso soup??? They had the smallest tempura shrimp I've ever seen, which makes me believe they buy low quality shrimp in bulk. They also had the typical mango yogurt dessert which a lot of Asian all you can eat places offer. I really look forward to this dessert but lord have mercy, the mango syrup was grainy and watery. I wish I took  some pictures but I didn't even want to waste my time. I do not recommend this place to anyone.

Theres nothing special about this place and the bill for two people on a Saturday night came to be about $61 after tax not including tip. Their washrooms are also really dirty, there was toilet paper everywhere on the floor. I'm really disappointed with this place."}
{"text":"First time I went here. I tried their \"love of flower\" sushi first (the one with rice wrapped by salmon and topped with mayo). Completely surprised by the taste as the mayo tasted nothing like mayo but instead tasted like yoghurt drink, which is unheard of and weird. Next, the other sushis (rice with fish on top), the ratio of fish to rice is bad, way too much rice, feels like they are just trying to make us full by stuffing us with rice. Also, the rice of the sushi was too sour. For dessert, their tiramisu is the worst I have ever seen. They didn't put any effort into them. The tiramisu was just cream on top of a biscuit, which looks nothing like tiramisu. 

In short, not worth the price, you can get better sushi ayce with around the same price elsewhere easily"}
{"text":"We had AYCE dinner and food was pretty standard.  Wide selection of appetizers, fried and grilled, sushi, sashimi, rice, udon and dessert dishes.  Service was pretty speedy too.  Seating area is spacious so definitely can accommodate; we were able to dine on a Friday night without reservations.  Not a bad choice but nothing superb either."}
{"text":"The food is quite good for an AYCE restaurant, but the service is a bit lacking. The servers aren't very friendly and don't really make the effort to go out of their way for customers, which is fine because the service is fast, efficient and they're not actually rude, just blunt. 

They have crab legs on the weekends, which I really, really enjoy. There's so much variety on the menu that you really can never get bored here. 

I enjoy the fact that you get to order from a tablet and you can access your order to see whether you've received everything. It's well worth the price."}
{"text":"They are not very busy regardless of the day of the week as i have gone on the weekend and weekday. Its extremely spacious and have ample of seating. You order from an IPad which is neat. They have a good variety.
Definitely not the best sushi, it's alright.
I like the fact that they don't let the dishes pile up and make sure they take empty plates right away."}
{"text":"Not worth the money.
I love AYCE restaurants for their wide selection and your ability to try a lot of different items without added cost.  Unfortunately, there wasn't anything at Yokohama's that was worth coming back.  Slap on the $28 weekend dinner price tag and you're left with an unsatisfying dinner all around.

The service was pretty attentive and always prompt with clearing the table of empty dishes.  Not everyone was particularly friendly but that could be because they were busy.  I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.

It all comes down to food and they do have a pretty good selection and offer items not usually on your typical Japanese AYCE menus.  However, nothing stood out or was worthy of me wanting to binge on.  I'll list some of items below.


Sushi: average quality fish for an AYCE but way too much rice.  The salmon rose was hilariously terrible.  I'll attach expectation vs reality pics.

Cheese wonton: actually pretty good.  One of the only items I enjoyed.  The filling was just so creamy.

Chicken wings: nothing special but placed on top a pool of ketchup.  Why...?

Crab legs: Yokohama's offers these for weekend dinners.  I got a few but they always take a long time to come out and they're room temperature and overly salty.  I actually didn't much care for them.  Extremely disappointing since they shouldn't be something you can screw up.

Ramen/udon: good portion (small, which is great) but the broth wasn't very good.  The seafood ramen was filled with mushrooms with one shrimp and one piece of fake crab.

Lamb skewer: overlooked and dry.

Broccoli yakitori (skewer): cool idea, great texture, and smelled delicious!  But when I picked it up oil was running off it onto the plate.  Tasted way too oily for obvious reasons...

Chocolate mousse: not enough chocolate and it tasted like I was eating whipped cream.  I don't know how you can screw up mousse.

Ice cream: is it sad that this was the highlight of the meal?  I know it's just store bought but I love ice cream.


Overall, very disappointing.  Yokohama's main attraction seems to be their crab legs- and I can't believe I'm saying this but- it's not worth it!  You pay way too much for the poor quality of food."}
{"text":"As one who used to watch food network a lot, I know plating/presentation is important, however it's normally only worth 5 points in comparison to 20 in taste and I think 10 in creativity.

My parents took me here with a family friend once because they heard positive reviews from their friends but it was the worst sushi I've been to in a while. Their sashimi were sub par and ratio of rice to raw fish left much to be desired. 

Their cooked food were ok, because the only thing I can really say I liked were the tornado shrimps which were huge and fresh."}
{"text":"I don't know what is happening in the month of June- I am getting dragged around to tons and tons of sushi restaurants. 

This one is by far one of the cooler ones- IPAD to order, pictured details for every item on the menu. Smaller portions so that you are not overwhelmed. 

Food was flavourful; and lots of variety.

Definately one of the better Sushi places I have been too. Place was paaaacked!"}
{"text":"Walking out of this restaurant, I felt like I got lied to. This was NOT a Japanese restaurant by any means because the sushi and sashimi were probably one of the worst that I've ever had. (I would have had better luck eating the sushi from T&T Supermarket that's just across the street). The sashimi were cut really poorly and the sizes were small. 

And you know what...that wasn't even the WORST part! THEIR PLASTIC PLATES AND BOWLS REEKED of dish detergent/bleach. It was so bad that even the plastic coating around those plates and bowls were starting to peel. You literally felt the stickiness from the peeling plastic on the plates and bowls. (This wasn't just my cutleries, it was everyone's) My miso soap was a joke. It tasted like soap water. I really don't understand how you can mess up miso soap...just get a packet from your local grocery store and it'll taste better than the one from this restaurant! (I can still taste the soap after leaving the restaurant and my mouth feels dry from all the MSG)

The ONLY thing that I thought tasted mediocre was the takoyaki. Out of a whole array of foods that I had tried tonight, it was sad to say that this was the only item I would reorder. 

Overall, the decor, iPad menu and the cheesy lighting of the restaurant was a charade to cover up the poor food quality. If you're the owner of this restaurant, you should be ashamed."}

I came here on a Saturday night. At this point, my family and I knew that anywhere we go would've required waiting time. We waited for about 30 minutes which is reasonable based on the area and time (around 7:30). 
Since my dad was fairly hungry, I immediately ordered a batch shortly after sitting down. I like how they have the waiters confirm the order before sending it to the kitchen (not a fan of seeing wasted food). Food arrived at a very slow rate. 
When we brought this to the attention of the waiters and waitresses, they were kind and acknowledged the slow kitchen as well. Most dishes came in very small portions and looked very disappointing on the plate. 
However, I do recognize that they want to reduce wasted food and wouldn't want to charge customers, then cause a scene. 
It took a while to get our soy sauce dishes but they did come eventually, after finishing our sashimi. The sashimi was mediocre but there was a variety, which was accommodating. 
I was pleased with the monster roll though and mackerel, and of course the desserts, other than the mango yogurt. The mango topping was very sour and had a vibrant colour to it...didn't seem right. Also, this may be dumb to say but the ice cream didn't look that appealing because of the speck of mango ice cream and shape. Still tasted wonderful, of course. Taro tapioca did not seem viscous enough, unless this was what they were going for. Taro mousse was great. 
After about 1.5 hours, we talked to the manager about it and they kept saying we just didn't send it to the kitchen...but we did...3 times... They apologized for that and soon after, food came rapidly and was delicious. 

Highlight of the night: 
Waiter after telling him our food wasn't coming: Ya, you know, the kitchen does some orders and throws away some orders. They do what they can so just keep ordering. 
Pointer: Reserve ahead of time (if you know its going to be a busy night)."}
{"text":"Changed owners, fixed if not all, most of my previous complaints. 

Food is still average-ayce 

Service is \"Chinese\"

Wouldn't be my first choice but I'd come back if brought up."}
{"text":"My family comes to this place for AYCE sushi all the time. Their food isn't bad, torched sushi is quite decent too. Sashimi isn't bad. Teriyaki dishes are quite tasty and the ordering on iPads are obviously a standard now for AYCE so very easy to order. They don't have a huge selection of dessert and they've changed their ice cream orders to having to get it yourself at the ice cream station. Price is average for AYCE sushi. Overall, it's a decent place for AYCE."}
{"text":"I had beef teriyaki bento and several sushis. It was very fresh and delicious. Very good service. Thank you :)"}
{"text":"This is our go-to sushi place at my work. Whenever we come, we always get all you can eat for lunch. Personally I've always had fine experiences here - sometimes they forget the occasional dish but when ordering 10+ dishes for a large group that can happen. I like this place because you can order with the iPad, and the food comes quite quickly most of the time. 
Don't get the tirimisu for dessert - it is literally a vanilla wafer with a tiny squirt of espresso mouse that has no flavour. 
Other than that, good for large groups but be prepared to flag down wait staff to get your food and also make sure you know what you ordered cause sometimes they bring the wrong food to your table."}
{"text":"Great concept to use a tablet when ordering food, problem is that because we had no direct interaction with the staff no one had any idea where our food was.  When I asked, was told, \"Just order again\" but there's a disclaimer on the menu stating that if we don't finish what we eat there would be a surcharge and our concern was that we would get double.  So after 20 minutes, we ordered again... still no food... ordered again after another 20 minutes and only part of the order came out. 
I gave it two stars because the food was decent, but the service was poor.  
With so many other fine Asian restaurants in the area, will not be coming back here. 
Sayounara Yokohama!"}
{"text":"Yokohama is located in the T&T plaza. Usually the parking lot is packed, but on a Monday evening it wasn't bad. I'm not sure if it's because it was 8:30pm, but the restaurant was empty. However, it was nicely decorated and the washrooms were clean.

There's all-you-can-eat or a la carte. You can order with an iPad for AYCE. They give you a paper takeout menu if you do a la carte, which makes you feel even cheaper. I just ordered a simple bento box - the teriyaki chicken. It's reasonably priced at $10.95 + tax and tip.

The miso soup was a bit salty (if I notice it's salty, it must be really salty). The salad was a bit yellow. You had to ask for wasabi and ginger for the sushi. Chicken was a tad dry. It doesn't come with ice cream, but the staff was nice enough to add it."}
{"text":"Pretty standard all you can eat sushi. There is nothing special about it but they have some pretty slow service. Even though you order through an iPad the server still need to come over and a risky confirm and send the order so there isn't much of a point for the iPad. They also always forget some of the orders and sushi always comes in individual little plates which take up so much room."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst Japanese AYCE I have ever been to. If I could give it a 0 eating, I would. Service is horrible and the food is disgusting- looks nothing like the pictures. 
The set up and environment was modern and welcoming. You order on an iPad, which had no description of what was in their \"special rolls\" so we had to judge by the small pictures that were provided. After ordering, they have servers confirm the order before sending it to the kitchen.

The food came at a reasonable pace, however everything that came to our table did NOT look like what was on the iPad.  Not only did they not look appetizing, they also tasted DISGUSTING.  I have never consumed a nastier seaweed salad. How do you go wrong with seaweed salad??? We also ordered a Philadelphia roll (which has cream cheese in it), and the cream cheese tasted like it had gone bad. We told the server to take it away, then she felt she had the audacity to yell at us telling us not to waste food and if we don't like it, we should not order it. We told her the cheese in the roll tasted funky, she continues to argue with us saying \"that's how cream cheese tastes.\" First of all, really??? Second of all, I think we all know how cream cheese tastes! And it certainly does not taste funky like that! Third of all, how are we supposed to know if we like the rolls or not without ordering it first?? During this time, our teapot lid was opened, indicating that we needed refill on the hot water. Of course she did not refill it, neither did any of the other inattentive servers. 
We decided to order some more to see if there was at least one item on the menu we would like. We wait for the server to come to confirm our order. Another server comes, and starts to yell at us in Mandarin saying \"you guys are ordering too much.\" And she walks off without confirming our order. By this time, I was PISSED OFF. I have never experienced such horrible customer service, and this was the worst sushi I've ever eaten. 
Of course I complained to the manager and l he did was apologize 10,000 times in his accent that was very hard to understand. He then proceeds to give me vouchers for the next stay which I declined since I will never return. By this time, our teapot was still not refilled (after waiting 30+ minutes), so I told the manager to go refill it for our table and stormed out while the rest of my party stayed to dine. 

Many people come here because of the AYCE crab legs. All I can say is, do not order the crab legs. 

I am a guilty foodie and it takes a lot for me to call food disgusting but the food at this restaurant was almost inedible. This is a restaurant I will never return to, and will never recommend to anybody unless they want horrible service and funky tasting food."}

My mum is constantly on the hunt for restaurant deals in the Chinese newspaper and she found a coupon for Yokohama. It was $5 off a adult dinner meal, so my friend and I decided to go try it out. 

For a Thursday evening at 7:30pm, only about half the restaurant was full. They sent out food in a fair amount of time and there are definitely some unique rolls and dishes on the menu. 

I found that their sushi rice was not made very well, even with the most experienced chopstick user, the sushi fell apart as I was picking it up from the plate. 

They have a \"dessert bar\", it's really just their way of having you grab your own ice cream. When I was there, the ice cream bar was messy and the water for the ice cream scoop was not on. It really put me off on the ice cream. 

Everything was just ok, but then I mean, it's an all you can eat, it's definitely not Kaka level AYCE."}
{"text":"Bad service . My friend and I arrived around 9:30pm and they were closing at 11:00pm. The waitress serving us was new and she did not give us the miso soup or salad when we had ordered the bento box. The service was bad. Kept having to get their attention. The california rolls came first, but there wasnt any soya sauce given. The wasabi and ginger came later. Our bento came and while we were eating, the waitress came and gave us the bill saying they are closing the cash registers and we have to pay. We had to ask for the miso soup, salad and ice cream cuz they forgot to give. When they brought the ice cream, there was no spoon in the bowl. Their wifi doesnt even work! Luckily we could steal Green Grotto's wifi signal."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place gets such a raw deal with yelp users 

I have been here several times over the last few Canada trips and each time I'm happy with, the ease of ordering on the iPad, the selection available, the price, the efficiency of the staff and the sushi chef as well as the freshness of the ingredients 

It's a wonderful place"}
{"text":"Food was OK. Portions were comically funny for some dishes but the quality was quite average. HOWEVER if you try their Torch Sushi it definitely shows their efforts, I might have gone on an unlucky night for myself as I wasn't enjoying a Spicy Salmon Maki roll like I usually would. I love the iPad order creation concept and would come back for it. But their 24.99 Evening price definitely not worth it to me for the food - better come for lunch"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today and was greatly disappointed. Usually I never make reviews for restaurants simply because I am too lazy to do so. However, this restaurant prompt me to write so others can avoid my mistake. Let's get started on the service of the staff. 
Is it ever acceptable for a waiter/waitress to slam your plate of food on the table? Absolutely not. Did Yokohama's staff do so? They definitely did. When we got our desserts, the staff dropped the utensils for the desserts on the table with no napkin around or beneath it. When I say dropped, I meant literal dropping the spoons onto the table. Not only is the gesture alone is rude, but the fact that she walked away immediately just shows how under trained the staffs of this restaurant is. 
The quality of the food usually compensates for the horrible service, but this didn't happen. Yaki, such as skewers are usually grilled--Yaki is a method of cooking food by grilling or pan fried. This did not happen with the yaki that we received in Yokohama. My family owns restaurants across the United States and after working in the kitchen for most of my life, I can certainly confirm that all their skewers were fried in oil (ie. wrinkled broccoli, mushroom, extremely greasy meat skewers).
I would further elaborate on my horrible experience with this restaurant, but I feel that I have made my point clearly with just the few examples above."}
{"text":"Came here for a friends bday dinner, and the interior is pretty nice. You order using iPads, this is my first time going to a iPad sushi restaurant ordering ayce. We were given around 2 hrs from the time we inputted our first order, this was per iPad per table. This restaurant offers a lot of variety in food choices, although very messy with their delivery of food because we got some dishes wayyyy after we had already ordered our desserts. We were a very large group and with that being said our foods that we wanted did not exactly come our way. We didn't get a chance to eat half the food that we ordered, instead we got other peoples food and vice versa. 

The food was your normal ayce sushi dishes, with added specialties that other sushi places may not have such as crab legs, deep fried oysters, mini sushi pizzas and different mackeral sashimis. 

The service was okay, they were a bit slow for some of our dishes and it was a bit annoying to order more using the iPad but worried that it may come out a million years later. We got a lot of food, at times we got double our order that we only wanted 1 of. I can only speak for the table that I was seated at and I don't know how the other tables with the group were like. 

The restaurant itself was clean...however the washroom is gross. It was the worst that I have ever seen a washroom get, even compared to busy mall washrooms this one still takes the cake. It was nasty. It was like trying to be a ballerina and avoiding landmines.

Not a bad place to try but not sure if ordering on iPads are my thing, maybe if I came back with a much smaller group I would have a different opinion."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch, and found that the service was extraordinarily slow. Our first round of orders didn't even go through at all. Throughout the meal, we would find that a lot of our sushi would be extremely delayed or that it just would not arrive. The rolls were small and poorly constructed. Half of our time was spent just staring at each other not eating anything because there would be no food on the table."}
{"text":"Charge holiday prices for Remembrance Day, which is not even a stat holiday for most people. If they're donating the extra money to veterans, great, but they don't. Not coming back. Shameful to sponge off the veterans"}
{"text":"Came for weekend dinner.  Some missed orders but not too bad.  Torched sushi and sashimi came very fast.
Sashimi sliced thin.  Average quality but they do have sweet shrimp on weekends.  Very small pieces.  Torched sushi was pretty good.  Ordered 3 rounds and got all our orders.  
Skewers are deep fried not grilled.  
Handrolls were good.  But sushi and other rolls - found their rice too soft so rolls and sushi fall apart easily.
Surprisingly service was pretty good.  And i-pad ordering was very simple.  No need for waitress to confirm order.
Desserts - black sesame ice cream, durian mousse and ginger milk were ok.  
Restaurant was pretty full at 7pm.  Dinner was ok but for the price, I would stick to my regular place."}
{"text":"I see all the low reviews and I can kind of see why, but on the other hand, I'm astonished that so many people gave it 1 star when there are so many worse places to go for AYCE in markham/scarborough. 

The service here is quite blunt. They just want to get any interaction between you and them over with. That's fine- that's why they have ipads right? I wouldn't want to talk to humans either, let's be honest. The servers are so silent that they had 0 response to a bunch of kids on the other side of the restaurant running around, poking each other with chopsticks and straws and making so much noise. Everyone else in the restaurant was clearly annoyed and gave looks but the servers just watched and let the kids do their thing. Ugh.. remind me never to have any?
The ipads run smoothly and I've never had any missing orders, so good for them. The fresh is not the freshest of the sea, but it's still pretty good. The chef obviously cares about the presentation, as all our rolls and sashimi comes out looking good. The decor inside is clean and modern, definitely a sushi-bar-esque feel. 

Now.. complaints..? Kind of? I don't really like how the menu has SO many pages of irrelevant things on it, that has nothing pertaining to sushi. There are so many fried rice dishes, udon, ramen.. like c'mon.. I came here for sushi and I'm not gonna stuff myself with dishes that I can get for a cheap price a few steps away from comic-sans keung's delight. Sushi restaurants offering these dishes also means there's not much time put into them and they often do not turn out tasting very good. I also did not like the calamari here.. it was so dry and small.. like eating a hard piece of fried rubber?? Ech. Everything else is standard or above standard. I definitely loved the mango rolls, the green dragon roll and the winner of the night goes to the roast lamb skewers! They were BOMB. If you come here, you must get it!"}
{"text":"I bought a Groupon deal of $43.50 for 2 people, valid any day, which is a good deal as the regular dinner price during weekdays is $26.99 per person. Went there on a Wednesday evening for dinner around 6pm, the place was not so busy and we were quickly seated. 

Food and beverages are ordered on a tablet. I must say that they don't have much variety of food compared to other AYCE places I've been for this price BUT soft drinks are free, including sprite and ginger ale. The portion of their food is quite small too, but it's AYCE, so we can always order more if we'd like. Food-wise, the taste and flavour was good for everything but I didn't like their rolls and sushi as I feel like there are too much rice. The portions they give are small compared to other places, especially their desserts. The tiramisu is like a joke, only 1 tiny piece of cake and the rest filled with whipped cream.

Service was good. There were always staff who'd pass by and they'd remove all the empty dishes from our table and our orders were mostly accurately served (except for the beef tataki that we didn't get for our first order).  We didn't get any last call notice, and we didn't have any time limit for staying (although it's written that it's 1.5h when it's busy which is understandable). 

Update: Changed from 4 stars to 3 stars. Having been there a few times now, I don't like their cuisine as much as before. Last time I went (few days ago) their Tom Yum soup was soooo salty. Their desserts are so tiny in portion that you can eat it in 1 bite/gulp. The brown sugar \"yogurt\" didn't taste like brown sugar at all and was very bland. The only thing that I like is their sashimis, beef tatakis and deep fried scallops. 

Food: 3.75/5 - now 3/5
Price: 3.5/5 same but (4/5 with Groupon, not available anymore)
Service: 4.75/5 - now 4/5"}
{"text":"Oh man where do I start, I had a bad feeling about the place once I stepped in. Since it is a Friday night I decided to call to make reservations but they told me I've called too late for reservations and that if I do decide to come in I would have to wait for a while since they were very busy.We decided to go anyways and when we stepped in half the restaurant was empty. I do not appreciate being lied to. The staff is Chinese and Chinese music was playing which I found was odd since it is Japanese restaurant. The staff also give off the vibe that they don't care too much for their job as there were no smiles and never checked up on us and it sounded like they didn't really understand English. The service was fast but the food was average some items were below average. The only good items were the sashimi, shrimp/yam/pumpkin tempura, enoki mushroom wrapped with beef, and lamb skewers. We ordered the pepper beef, which was bland and definitely not marinated, pad Thai which was sickly sweet, various rolls that were drenched in sauce or mayo, and general tao chicken which I questioned if there was even chicken under all that batter and sauce. The tea didn't even taste like tea more like hot water, the wasabi was not spicy at all and they didn't provide us with any ginger. Whenever we asked the server what item she was giving us she rudely stated that she doesn't know. Really? You work here and don't know the items on the menu? When it was time to order dessert we thought that for sure we would enjoy them. Oh boy were we wrong. The mango yogurt was decent but the mango tapioca was more like a watery pudding, the mango pudding had a slight mango flavour but for some reason had hints of a spice flavour (so gross), the taro and red bean dessert which were stated as served hot on the menu but were served luke warm and was very watery. My mom ordered ginger ice cream as it is her favourite,kinda hard to screw that up, but it had a weird spice flavour and was way too sweet that she couldn't even finish 1 scoop( which I've never seen her do). I ordered a red bean ice cream which never came. Ordered the fruit bowl as the picture showed a good amount of fruit, I kid you not it came with 1 grape, 3 pieces of cantaloupe, and 3 small pieces of canned pineapple. My family had a good laugh after that. They also forgot the last couple items we ordered and only brought them out when we were finishing up our dessert. They were also very slow in bringing the bill and added the tip automatically to it. For the price of $28/person it is definitely not worth it and I would probably never come back here."}
{"text":"Interesting that they use Apple iPads to do the ordering with and they leave it with you at the table.  The food isn't bad but I've had better.  I would wish for a better and larger selection of food.  Service is good but not sure if I'll be back.  Warning:  Parking is horrendous on a Friday and weekend eve because it's shared with the T & T Supermarket."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner around 7:30 pm. Been wanting to try this place out and finally here I am. AYYYY. Overall, I think it was an okay experience. 

This place is technically a tad bit more advanced than compared to other AYCE places. Instead of having to say what you want to the servers or checking off whatever, YOU USE IPADS. WOT WOT!!! AND YOU DONT EVEN NEED TO WAIT FOR THE SERVERS TO COME AND CONFIRM YOUR ORDER. They're sent to their systems in like a minute or so.

Food wise, there is quite a lot to choose from. Generally, their stuff aint too bad. There were only a few that stood out. Some of their sushis were pretty bomb. I would say what they were if ONLY I REMEMBERED LOOOL. You see, I haven't eaten since 9 in the morning (bad scheduling of classes lawl -_-) so HOMEGIRL WAS HELLA HUNGRY. LIke I just chose whatever and ATE whatever. Oh, I just wanted to mention the only thing I remembered and HATED SO MUCH AND IT WAS THEIR BEEF TATAKI HOLY SHIT BALLS YALL I WAS EXPECTING IT TO TASTE LIKE WHAT I HAD AT THE EDO TEPPAN AT DISNEYWORLD BUT NONONONNONONONONO IT LOOKed LIKE A MESS AND TASTED LIKE A MESS and god dam it was like I was chewing gum ffs; i tried so hard to gulp it down, but my throat was like nuh uh son not today. DEFINITELY DO NOT RECOMMEND

Pros:
- lots of foods to choose from
- some of their sushi rolls are pretty damn bomb
- fresh sashimi (loved the surf clam and octopus)
- ipad ordering system
- very good coke (it tasted so good here?@! for some reason?!)
- manager is pretty cool and nice (cant tell if hes like that always or just because we were VIPS)
- pretty attentive staffs
- have thai food options (im confused bc its supposedly a \"jap\" restuarant, but its cool wuteva)

Cons:
- many of the things i ordered didn't come
- some things came out super slow
- beef tataki is a no bueno
- interior is meh; rather dark and feels like a dennys restaurant to me
- pretty expensive ($28.99 for adults at dinnertime)

ALthough, it was a relatively okay experience, I don't know if I want to come again. There's definitely better places out there. so yah. yah."}
{"text":"Overall,  it's not that clean in here.  The windows were dirty,  the plates have this odd feeling to it.  Makes it feel like a matte texture,  seems like it wasn't cleaned properly 

Plates that the food were brought in had residue all over it. 

The sushi rice was over seasoned with vinegar.  I had a bone in my BBQ eel sushi

Some were good,  some weren't."}
{"text":"This AYCE sushi place is awful. I don't mean little awful I mean really really bad.  The staff are efficient but because you order from an iPad they are not friendly. I could live with that if the food was good but yuck. Chicken pad Thai was mushy, made of ketchup and not edible. Sashimi and sushi rolls are passable. What is really bad are the desserts. The mango yoghurt is hairy and gritty and tasteless. It's like I was eating mango pubes. The ginger milk was disgusting. Too heavy on the ginger. It was literally burning my mouth and stronger than taking a bite out of a real piece of ginger. The mango Tapioca has no Tapioca and is just mango milk. The ice cream is freezer burnt. Oh and the all you can eat crab legs are cold even though they are supposed to be hot. I would never come back here.... like ever. And this place is infested with flies which is unsanitary and disgusting"}
{"text":"Got a groupon deal for this and decided to use this on a weekend. You can only use it on certain time slots (5pm-6pm or after 8pm), and they won't let you have a table (even if there's one available) until it hits the exact start time. 

I would say the food is your average all you can eat sushi place. However the speed for the sushi VS the cooked items does not match. They want to fill you up on all of the cooked food before your sushi order arrives. And let me tell you, it's definitely a long wait for the sushi order. On the weekend, some of their special items include baby octopus and sweet shrimp. I placed 20 pieces of sweet shrimp on the ipad order (this was sharing between 2 people, so I didn't think I was going over board with it). After waiting 30 mins, only 10 pieces of sweet shrimp came. I ordered again, placing another order of 20 pieces. Another 20 mins pass by and I brought it up a waitress that we waited a long time for our order. She just gave me a cold stare and looked at the Ipad. To my surprise, she said the Ipad battery was low and our entire last order (including my other hot food items) were now gone and I had to reorder everything. I asked her if I could at least get the raw sushi items since I had been already waiting for a long time. She gave me a firm no and told me to just redo everything. So there I am, back at ordering my previous items and waiting another 20 mins, to only get yet another small handful of 10 pieces of sweet shrimp. Finally brought this up to the manager and she personally went to get me the right amount I ordered.

We were there for 2 hours but most of it was waiting for your sushi orders to arrive and constantly checking when your food is coming.

Disgustingly (which I wish I took a picture of), midway through our meal I found a long piece of hair in my baby octopus dish. I pointed it out to the waitress and accidentally dropped the octopus to a plate that had 2 left over sushi pieces on it while showing her the evidence. Instead of apologizing to me that the dish had a hair in it, she shrugged it off and had the nerve to ask me if I still wanted the 2 sushi pieces that the hair was lying on. Obviously no. And most likely I won't be back again. 

Horrible service. Mediocre food. Next."}
{"text":"Came here for my AYCE birthday dinner after hearing about the promotion for crab legs. Unfortunately, it was only being offered during the weekend, which wasn't really made specific in their ad. Sighs. No worries, as I wasn't really a fan anyways. At 8pm, the restaurant was pretty empty on a Monday night. They use an iPad ordering system, which I am a fan of, because you can see what you've previously ordered and it saves paper! 

Their sashimi was not that fresh at all, the salmon being way too slimy and unappealingly soft in texture. The octopus tasted fishy and the scallop sashimi was lukewarm. Their sushi was okay, the rice was quite gummy. The pre-made spicy salmon and tuna mix by the sushi bar in tubberware bins was very unappealing to look at, as there were plenty of them, so obviously the freshness raises a flag. Their hot food items were pretty good though, especially the Seafood Pad Thai, lamb skewers, chicken skewers and fried chicken wings. Their desserts however, were not great. The mango pudding was okay, but the mango tapioca was like drinking mango juice with 3 or 4 tapioca balls in them (yes I counted) , and the mango yogurt tasted funky. This is the first place to screw up mango yogurt, which is my favourite at AYCE restaurants. So disappointing! I know restaurants pre-freeze their ice cream all scooped up, however the ones here were rock solid and full of ice pieces. The waitresses don't speak much English or Cantonese either, and during our dinner they were all having their own conversations by the counter area, eating ice cream. It was a pretty hot day, and it felt the same inside. We were literally sweating halfway into our dinner. Not cool. I definitely would not come back, as there are other better AYCE places in my opinion."}
{"text":"Overall it is an ok joint for AYCE joint. Sushi Skill Rolling Technique can be a bit better. Some of our rolls were loose and fell apart. Taste wise, the sashimi was fresh, but some of the cooked items like the chicken wings was bland in taste."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to go to Yokohama because they had a Groupon deal that seemed easy to take upon. AYCE sushi dinner for two sounds great. The terms of the Groupon are solely to make a reservation with the restaurant before arriving so they know you will be redeeming a voucher for your meal. 

So why only one star?

We called the restaurant to make a reservation and after a dozen attempts, someone finally picked up the phone and didn't really understand why we were making a reservation. But they allowed us to make one for 2pm the following day. 

We showed up just before 2pm and mentioned to the hostess that we had a reservation and a groupon voucher to redeem.  We were seated and began our ordering. Sad to say, some of our food items ordered never came to our table, but you order with an iPad? How could you miss it?

The seafood was mediocre at best, but it's an AYCE place in Markham so as abundant as these places are, you can't always be picky with service and quality. 

Where it really went sour was when it came time to actually redeem the voucher the server refused to take it. \"I don't want to cheat you because it's really supposed to be for the dinner menu. If I had known I would have given you the dinner menu to start with. So just pay cash for your bill and come back another time for dinner to use the voucher.\" 

But... we told you when we walked in we had a Groupon deal and made reservations like it asks you to do? Now we are being told to come back any time and use it for dinner and now essentially pay for another set of meals? Ridiculous. 

We paid and left. 

The following night we came back for dinner because we didn't want to waste the voucher. We walked into a nearly empty restaurant and again mentioned the Groupon deal. The server almost refused to seat us because we didn't make reservations. 

I'm sorry, the restaurant wasn't even a quarter of the way full for the evening and you're lecturing us about making reservations? 

Anyway dinner service went on and the overall experience was much better than lunch from the previous day. The seafood was of better quality and service was quick and accurate. 

When it came time for the bill, I owed the taxes for the Groupon deal (a normal sneaky practice of Groupon plus any tips). 

I paid with debit and suddenly I had an extra $5 added to our bill as tip. If you have a $5 minimum for debit transactions, please disclose that, I would've gladly paid with cash. Instead we find out the server added a $5 tip without first getting approval from her customers not disclosing there is a minimum charge for debit card transactions. Sneaky and deceptive. 

To add insult to injury, we both have had sour stomachs since our dining experience with Yokohama. Lesson learned, in the worst possible way."}
{"text":"The food was good they have some unique items on the menu, the service was okay they took a long time."}
{"text":"This is a better than average AYCE sushi place.  They have some unique items other AYCE restaurants don't have such as seared beef wrapped around Enokitake mushrooms, torched sushi, Steak tartare, Thai food and the list goes on.  Management and staff have changed since last year and the place has been nicely renovated.  Service and food came super fast, and we enjoyed ordering by I-pad.  This place is a bit more expensive than other AYCE places.  The bill for lunch with tax totalled $38.00 (before tip) for two Adults.  We found it to be worth it and will return."}
{"text":"WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!

Been here twice in the past, and they turned to be bad ones.

So, when the Girlfriend bought a Groupon for their weekend AYCE Buffet with Pops for 2 priced at $43.50, I decided to give them one last shot before calling it quits with this establishment.

The Groupon specifically required reservations, so we called 12 times on Friday, and each time the phone went to voicemail, that had not been set up, after a few rings. We tried another 8 calls on Saturday, and this time the calls went straight to the voicemail, no rings. So we decided to stop by on our drive to make a reservation for later in the evening or the next day (Sunday). There were about 20 people seated at the entrance waiting for tables presumably. So we stood with them for about 10 minutes without any employee stopping by. Eventually I had to raise my voice and wave my hands, and a grumpy waitress showed up.

We showed her the Groupon we had and enquired about reservations. She said they don't take reservations. We showed her that the Groupon specifically asked for reservations. Instead of answering, this time she pulled a notebook with names and phone numbers and showed us the waiting list. We asked ourselves as to why would she be contradicting herself. Anyhow, we asked for a reservation the following day, she suggested we walk in and get a table. We told her we would like to make a reservation since we were not looking to wait 30-60 mins for a table, and she suggested we call the restaurant. We explained the whole phone calls not being answered situation, and she said that since they were busy to answer their phones.

At this time things were taking a bizarre turn and we asked to speak with the manager. She proceeded to tell us that the manager is busy on the floor and couldn't meet us till the closing time, and then proceeded to berate us in front of 20 odd people. She proceeded to tell us how the brown folks had no patience, no manners, and were ruining their fine establishment. At this time my girlfriend (she is Chinese) came to my defence. I restrained her, and suggested to her that we leave since this fine establishment is doing business well enough that they needed the Groupon and don't want any brown or skinned clientele at their tables.

I've long heard rumours about this establishment being a bunch of bigots who racially discriminate against non-East Asian potential client, but now I've experienced it first hand.

We are taking this up with Groupon, but that's another issue. However coming back to this establishment, I've experienced passive racism many times at many places, and gone with the flow, but never have I felt humiliated and reduced to the lowest denominator because of my race/ethnicity by a bigoted narrow minded person, and all this for trying to book a table at a dining establishment."}
{"text":"Me and my friends went there last Friday (Aug 25) for dinner ayce. We purchased a groupon discount which worked fine when we pay.

My overall experience in Yokohama was not good.

1) Our couch and table had some sticky shiny spots all over and my napkin and plate had soya sauce stains on them. I was unsure what those sticky spots were. I asked the waitress to clean them but the sticky spots weren't thoroughly removed after cleaning. Also, no apologies from anyone. Also, tips were already calculated and added to our bill. 

2) They use iPad to order. But their iPad has a ~20cm USB charging cable free-hanging from it. I have never been to any iPad-ordering restaurant who does that. There were a few occasions that the free-hanging USB cable touched the food when being passed around to order. It was very inconvenient and gross if it touches the food. Who wants their food taste like USB cable? Lol. Side note, a few items never came and a few items came very late which we double ordered because we thought they were not coming. Kind of typical in an ayce restaurant. Just sucks when the item got double ordered and came twice was udon.

3) The sushi rice on the sushi and maki were way too big. It reminded us when ayce places first started to emerge and they give you huge portions of rice to fill you up so they can cut the cost. Honestly, no ayce restaurants do this now. Me and my friends were so astonished / pissed / entertained / amazed at the same time because we haven't seen this much sushi rice for a long time. Sorry for no photos. Haven't thought of taking pictures at that time. It was a good laugh though.

4) Their torched sushi was the worst I have had so far. They just put more sauce on top to mask the bland taste. Some were even cold, but you called them \"torched\" sushi?

5) Their drinks cost extra so I usually order soups at ayce. The lobster bisque (weekends only) was okay on the first few sips. For a moment I thought it was a highlight of our dinner. But then I found it extremely salty afterwards. Considering I am a person whom my mom yells at me because I eat too salty, that might give you an idea how salty it was. In fact, I have tried their miso soup and Thai coconut shrimp soup too and they all tasted salty.

6) The dessert selection was little. I ordered the tiramisu and the chocolate mousse. They were quite terrible-presenting. The tiramisu was a corner of a coffee-dipped biscuit with ordinary whip cream on top (photo). That's definitely not how tiramisu is made and they literally didn't care. The chocolate mousse was just a squirt of mousse lying slanted on the plastic shot glass (photo). I can picture the owner saying \"At least they tasted sweet. What do you want?\" Honestly, their presentation looked way off comparing to other Jap ayce places. This also amused me and my friends.

I would say the only thing I liked about this restaurant is that they have sweet shrimp and Herring Roe sashimi (weekends only). I don't know any other Jap ayce restaurants that provide Herring Roe sashimi.

By the way, the restaurant was only half full on a Friday night at 7:30pm and it is located right at the large intersection of Warden and Steeles. That might give a clue how people view this restaurant.

We decided we won't go back anymore even with a groupon discount."}
{"text":"I was disappointed at the order we order 10salmon rose sushi only 4came out most of the food didnt come out. The kitchen food came out all and faster then the sushi stuff. We complaint to manager nothing happen.
The rice is in the sushi pc is the size of my 2fingers huge n seafood on top so small.

There a gratiuty of 10% added on bill you find the ipad menu price.
The service is bad no interaction they take forever to clear your table empty plates.

Dont waste time or money here"}
{"text":"Of all the AYCE in the area, this would have to be one of the best ones I've been too. All of the bells and whistles, with the quality to back it up for the most part. 

originally I was going to give this a full 5 stars but after going back a second time and observing a drop off in certain areas I'm a little hesitant to go more than 3.5.

brief description: Ayce place with iPad ordering, plenty of dining space (not going to need a reservation even on a Saturday evening) and lots of new nifty stuff like the flame sushi, lobster bisque, and creative deserts. 

Location: Warden and Steeles in a grocery plaza with lots of parking. large restaurant but with granite tables and lots of seating it's open and welcoming for a casual dinner in a nice atmosphere. 

service: it's all iPad ordering with a BIG menu. lots of house special rolls and items that are very tasty. 

pricing: I got here using two Groupons but pricing is about what you'd expect about $30 per person not including tip. Groupon certainly helped. 

food and service: I went two different Saturdays. the first time there was a novelty of it. they were still relatively new, maybe a few weeks old? might have been only their 3rd or 4th weekend open. food was stellar. flame sushi was delicious, all rolls were made very well (hopefully the pictures represent that) and multiple things to choose from. 

flavours were fresh and delicious. second time almost as good as first but a few things really came up in that food quality wasn't the same. the plating wasnt as creative, and some of the non sushi items were almost done as a ln after thought. I'll chuck it up to a bad a night. 

They also forgot (despite iPads) several items. now, to be fair, I did use Groupon to go here and that saved us I believe about $10 each or so. some of the other short comings are within the other reviews but I'd be happy to give them 3.5 out of 5.0 any day. 

for Ayce that's not a bad thing. 

If someone asked me which Ayce I'd recommend? this is top 2 for me. give it a shot."}
{"text":"Quality of food is typical of what you'd expect at an all-you-can-eat place. You place your order on an iPad which is pretty convenient. The selection of food is not quite as good as some of the other places though. 

My biggest problem is the service. They frequently forgot to bring parts of our orders. And when the wait staff did bring us food, they would throw it on to the table. I have never seen such rude service. The desserts were self serve at a bar near the door, but there were no labels on anything, so there's no way to know what you're getting. But that doesn't really matter anyway because the custard/mousse/yogurt or whatever they were didn't have any flavour."}
{"text":"Came here with my family and 2 kids. The service is really bad. Had asked 2 of the waitresses for things  and their attitude is bad. You ask for something, there is no answer and just walks away or gives you that look. (The one with glasses and a pony and the one that's skinny with brown dyed hair in a bun/pony). Please note that the place is not even busy! Majority of the waitresses here are rude except for the one with a very long hair. 

We ordered sashimi at least three times on the iPad. It took a very long time and nothing came to our table. Asked the waitress, she didn't answer and she didn't even go check for us. We asked a waiter. He went immediately and got it for us. The waiter is great, he answers (mannered). 

The Miso soup or anything basically that is soup is way too salty! Some of the cooked food are also very salty.
At the end we ordered mango yogurt. It was WAY too sweet! The mango sago was basically run down with water. 

Will not be coming back here again. 
Better off paying at a much higher place with better quality of food than getting shitty service/food."}
{"text":"One of the best in town . Very friendly staff . Clean and fast service   
Fun part is you will get an iPad and keep ordering and ordering. 
Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch with my girlfriend.  Tje restaurant advertised a lunch special for $7.99 but as soon as we arrived,  we were given the iPad which is used to order the \"all you can eat\" lunch only. This costs $15.99 per person, guess the $7.99 price advertised is to get people in,  dazzle them with the dancing iPad method of ordering food and charge them double of the advertised. 

Miso soup was luke warm and was missing dashi, an expensive but important ingredient in Miso Soup. The salad was cucumber and carrots only, no tomatoes. 

The dynamite roll was not exactly dynamite,  but the taste was not bad. I found the portions small.

The Alaska Roll & Spicy tuna roll was delicious,  but the meal somehow lacked the authentic Japanese zing. It was catered more for the Canadian palate.

Okay restaurant for the price. .... you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"This ayce Japanese restaurant is great and so cool. You order with iPads. The food selection is plentiful with lots of options other than just Japanese food unlike other Japanese restaurants. The food is okay and the service is satisfactory. The sushi is amazing and much better than other restaurants. The sashimi is good too but it's only available for dinner. The price is decent."}
{"text":"The absolute WORST all you can eat sushi place I have ever been to. Do not go there and waste your $30 per person meal. Every single dish we got tasted like the chef never learnt how to cook before. Soups are ridiculously salty, udon broth tastes like its made with water, soy sauce, a ton of artificial stocks and msg. All the dishes are drenched in sweet eel sauce or some sort just loaded with sugar and you cant even taste any other seasoning or the actual dish. On top of that I never received my dessert. Servers never ask you if you needed anything either. You literally have to cut them off randomly when they walk by to run dishes. I almost puked and I felt terrible to have spent $150. DO NOT GO THERE. Wow. Im still so amazed at how much they screwed up!! The entire experience sucked."}
{"text":"Service was bad and the iPad system was so slow that our orders took around 10 minutes to go through. This could be due to our booth, which was hidden & next to the washroom, as nobody else seemed to be having this problem. Also, 30% of our orders never came even after ordering it for a second time, and a third in some cases. Terrible service and organization. 

The food was lousy as well. The quality of the food was not up to par and portions were extremely small. A piece of sashimi was smaller than half of what you would expect at a normal restaurant. They also never gave us the amount that was actually ordered. 

The chicken was extremely overcooked and lacking in flavour. We ordered tempura and they forgot to give us the dipping sauce. We asked three different people but didn't receive it until 10 mins after. I would not recommend coming to this restaurant and I will definitely not be returning."}
{"text":"Ordered the Yokohama special (19 pieces + soup & salad) and a Salmon teriyaki bento! 

-Sushi was delicious! I enjoyed the eel sushi, the salmon sashimi and the dragon roll
-Salmon in the bento box was OK tasting (not very flavourful and given a very thin portion)
-Miso soup was a little too salty
-Loved the salad with their salad dressing (I believe there was crab in it)
-Tempura was delicious except for the taro one (kind of dry)

Overall would order again just for the good deal and if I was craving sushi -- the (Yokohama special)"}
{"text":"It used to be really good when they started. Now its just awful. I usually dont post bad reviews till now. 

The service was bad, our sashimi did not get served until we followed up a bunch of times. The plates and cups were sticky and smelled like bleach. The floors were slippery. 

Dont go there."}
{"text":"Never coming back here again. Came here last week around 11:30am for 3 people. Total came up to almost $65, they include the tip. Not to mention, the tips were more expensive than the hst (???). The white tuna sushi was not even fresh, it was dry and flaky! Quality of the food here is low. The salmon for the salmon rose is super fatty, tempera batter hasn't properly risen, sushi rolls are made poorly (lots of rice, little ingredients, mediocre flavour) and the dessert contains a ton of gelatin. Then the red bean soup that's labeled as hot came cold, straight out of the fridge...The rating here says it all, don't even bother visiting. I did come here a few months ago and it was a bit better then but now it's really not worth visiting."}
{"text":"Nothing special about this place besides the fact it uses iPads to order. Interior was pretty nice but the service is horrible. The sashimi is the only thing decent to eat. The spicy soup noodle is just hot sauce and water, and the satay skewers were soggy and did not taste like satay. For the price they charge I would recommend going somewhere else. Also they never give you the right amount that you order. If you ordered 20 spicy salmon sushi , they'll give you about 6, making you constantly having to order more.  Also the staff is pretty slow and rude."}
{"text":"I came here with a coworker for AYCE lunch one day. We used to go to this place when it was a Vietnamese restaurant, but I guess that didn't work out so well, did it?

Anyway, the food was mediocre. Very typical of any sushi restaurant in the area these days, maybe even slightly worse. The food could be more fresh. It really was nothing special and I've definitely had better. The new up and coming thing these days is the iPad menu, which this place has. I like that because you can see photos of the food and you can order very easily from it.

They also have a salad, soup and ice cream bar where you can get up and self-serve.

Oh, and just to mention, this place doesn't look like a Kelsey's inside! It used to be a Kelsey's and the owners of the Vietnamese restaurant didn't change the ambiance one bit, but the owners of this Japanese restaurant did, so it no longer looks like a restaurant \"where everybody knows your name.\""}
{"text":"Sadly, I'm going to have to agree with most negative reviews regarding Yokohama. The food looked like nothing in the pictures, it was beyond loud with servers throwing (yes, THROWING) dishes, utensils, and cups into bins while cleaning tables, more than half of our order was forgotten even after we requested that it be checked on, and the food that actually did come out was SO SLOW--one dish at a time. Each order needed to be confirmed by a server. Too bad several would walk right by our table without stopping. It was getting to the point where we were going to walk out, which I would never dream of doing until I dined here. The service is absolutely atrocious, with the exception of one sushi chef, who not only prepared sushi, but came out to serve, bus tables, and fill tea kettles. I apologize for not knowing his name, but this guy was seriously the only shining star about this restaurant---and I hope he gets a job at a more deserving establishment."}
{"text":"Great service but food is okay. The miso soup and green tea was was kinda warm almost cold. I ordered a la carte as I didn't want to order all you can eat. 
The decor is very modern and nice ambiance.  I am not coming back! 1 star for food plus one for decor and service!

Warning! Do not use their washrooms.. unkept and smelt like sewer. Can you imagine what the kitchen looks like?"}
{"text":"This place is terribad it is so bad for markham it makes waterloo look like a gourmet paradise. The beef teriyaki was pure salt and it does not look at the picture.  The interior is immaculate so if you do decide to come you are better off going to the washroom for their beautiful sink and high pressure water from the sink. The food is so bad the mango pudding was not firm and it melted on the spoon. Please avoid unless you need to sit in a chair which is a very comfortable chair. In fact this is a two because the chair is comfortable. Also the service is muy muy badd food came so slow that it was thought to be forgotten and come when we were about to leave.  In conclusion don't go if you want to eat but if you like nice washrooms and comfortable chairs then go to ikea before coming here."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here on a Sunday night for some AYCE sushi. We made reservations beforehand and unlike many other busy AYCE restaurants, they actually saved us a table!

This place uses iPad for ordering which has its advantages and disadvantages. Since there was the five of us, only 2-3 people can look at the menu at a time. However, the app itself was very organized and you can see what you've previously ordered.

The food selection was quite impressive. There were many dishes that they offer here that I don't see at many other AYCE restaurants. For example, there were deep fried oysters and king crab legs (weekend dinner only). They also have a salad bar (there was kimchi) and dessert bar (mostly ice creams).

As for the atmosphere... my friend, Alex Y., was not pleased with the servers constantly dropping the dishes throughout the night creating a deafening noise that echoes throughout the whole restaurant. I thought that the restaurant was very clean and very well renovated with the changing lights in the background.

For the price that it was ($26), I thought that this was one of the better AYCE restaurants in my area."}
{"text":"Is this one of the best Jap AYCE place in town? No. But it's pretty good for the price. With Groupon purchase (which does not include tax and service fee), dinner for two costs about $55. Food mostly fresh and taste good for this price. Place is clean, but could be pretty loud with kids around. Service is pretty good for AYCE in terms of serving all the food you ordered and how long it takes, but don't expect the people to be super nice to you."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  Stopped us from ordering because we were ordering too much shasimi. Waited over 1 hour for desert. 

Shasimi is fresh and good.  Rolls fall apart and are sub-par."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch today. As I arrived, there was a big group leaving and all paying at the front cash. Because of this it took a while for someone to notice me. The iPad was easy to use to order food, however the order was not sent directly to the kitchen, instead you had to wait for a server to come and she puts in a code to send the order. I'm sure you have to wait on busy days. The food was good but nothing was super exciting. The mango tapioca pudding was quite liquid. The price is reasonable for lunch ($14.99)."}
{"text":"I've been to a bunch of places that have the fancy iPad ordering system and don't find it any better than ordering normally. It might be useful for showing you what you've already ordered, but the number one frustration is they don't bring you everything you've ordered (and since you know what you ordered, you're left sitting there thinking that it's still coming). They'll reduce the amount of sashimi you receive, leaving 11 salmon sashimi for 4 people. Random dishes won't ever come no matter how many times you order it and you'll only find out after you press them about it and find out it was never in stock, or they'll finally bring out the avocado sashimi after pursuing it 3 times.

Appearance is very nice. Brightly lit modern decor. Nicely staged pictures for the iPad menu. Most of the dishes came out with excellent presentation. They also have a wide variety of different dishes available and they seemed to be well thought out and weren't rehashes of existing items.

It is very strange that everything - the plates/bowls/utensils all had a rubbery feel (and that you could clean it with a napkin and a bit of water). Is this some sort of weird residue from their dishwasher? I tried not to think too much about it.

10% cash discount if you ask. I asked in Mandarin."}
{"text":"Yokohama? More like no-go hama. I never thought you could really mess up AYCE Sushi, but this place definitely knows how. The service is as you'd expect.. but the food quality was atrocious.. not going to bother going into detail. Plus, they will never give you the amount you order.. we ordered 16 pieces of sashimi and 6 came.. 6 pieces of short ribs and 2 came.. 1 roll and 2 orders came. It seems like they're constantly trolling you like it's a hidden camera prank show. Even with the groupon, our meal wasn't worth it. We spent half the time waiting on food just to find out it's not coming.. or if it does arrive.. it's crap. Spend a few extra dollars and go to kaka or dragon legend or something."}
{"text":"The food was great! Service was fast ... atmosphere wasn't bad for a Wednesday night. We had the all you can eat and for the selection that was presented to us on an ipad the price wasn't bad. Their food presentation was amazing! Especially when you order a sashimi dish it's served on top of a bowl of ice to keep the fish cool! 

Now... with great food and good price you wonder why I gave it 4/5 ... and that's because when we ordered desserts they gave us 2 stainless steel spoons for a group of 3. So I asked for a 3rd spoon for my non asian friend and she came back with a plastic one which I thought was extremely odd considering it wasn't busy so they could have ran out of stainless steel spoons so that put a bitter taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Everything tastes the same!

Not enough variety.. 

Lunch ayce are worth the $ 

Good place to sit in"}
{"text":"Came here with my girlfriend because we found the groupon deal but it does not include tax and mandatory 12% tip. Large menu variety but the quality is not very good. Servers do not pay much attention to customers and asking them for help requires a lot of effort even when it isnt busy. Overall, I would NOT say it is worth it even with the groupon. Under average AYCE sushi place."}
{"text":"First of all, this place ain't that great. Service here is mediocre due to the fact that they can't get your orders right even when it's pre-done for them on the iPad. I ordered a Mango beef and didn't get it, requested a follow up on it and then they bring me some curry beef skewer and tell me that this is it, but 5 mins later my actual mango beef came, which is frustrating. Everyone there don't seem to enjoy working there, they've just got this terrible attitude. They do not like to interact with you, which I understand because you do order on the iPad. They'll just come and drop off your food, literally drop it off, not kindly place it on the table.


Food is what matters at a restaurant and the sushi and food here just don't taste right. Let's put it this way, I wouldn't bring a homeless person here. Also, if you've got 8 or more people they charge you an extra 10% for who knows what reason, even though you're giving them more business. So basically they're saying not to have a party here."}
{"text":"Very disappointing experience overall on a Saturday evening service, see below:

- Portion sizes very inconsistent and generally small (see picture example)
- Poor food quality: cooked items arrived generally just warm (a few cold too), some items were not fresh (slightly dry and stale shrimp, beef), fish in rolls and sushi were not fresh (sashimi was good though)
- Service was very very slow for us and surrounding tables (e.g. Seaweed salad and mango salad took an hour)
- Given their tablet ordering system, many of our items were forgotten and did not arrive

Some good qualities:
- Servers were attentive to our needs and proactive
- Dessert was average

Overall I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"A disappointing experience overall. Perhaps it was because we were there with a Groupon deal or just simply that it was a busy night, but service was virtually nonexistent except for when they came with the tab at the end of our meal.

The food was decent in general (and the only reason for the 2*) - the sashimi was relatively fresh and the yakitori was good. The best thing we had was probably the lobster bisque, which is only available on weekends. The sushi came with a massive proportion of rice compared to fish, which is not uncommon with AYCE places that try to fill you up quickly. The beef sashimi looked not so appetizing in that it was piled into a little bowl soaking in red liquid. However, our biggest complaint was that about 40% of the items we ordered never even came. In total, we ordered 4 rounds of food. The first round came with the rolls and sushi almost 5 minutes after hitting the send button on the iPad. Handrolls, soup, salad, and yakitori came next in relatively quick fashion. The sashimi took a bit longer but eventually arrived. Teriyaki orders never came. On our second order, we attempted teriyaki again to no avail. Ramen and udon came almost instantly and sashimi took about 15 minutes to arrive. On the third order, we tried putting in 2 ramens and a fried rice - none of it came. We waited for about 20 minutes and finally put in 4th order of dessert. The ice cream and mousse arrived within 5 minutes and the deep fried banana was nowhere to be seen. The bill came on its own 5 minutes later.

There's not much to be said about the atmosphere of the restaurant apart from that it was super noisy the entire time we were there, but that can be expected of most AYCE Japanese restaurants in the area. We definitely will not be returning though - the passive aggressive method to limit food ordered by customers is not acceptable and frankly, false advertising by an AYCE establishment."}
{"text":"Haven't been to this restaurant before but as soon as I walked in the atmosphere was pretty dead. First of all, the plates are a bit unclean and u can still a bit of stain on the side of the plate and u can see quite a lot of dust near the glass top of the table....which was an red flag that this is not a very clean restaurant. Back to the quality of the food there, to be honest it wasn't that fresh and some of the food actually gave off a funny taste which was another big red flag...in conclusion I would not recommend this place to any of my friends due to its lack of sanitary."}
{"text":"Food was decent not as good as others sushi places in the Markham area. The food took way too long to get to our table and the chefs kept bringing us less food than the amount we ordered. We complained to a supervisor and after that they decided to just throw us any kind of food and rolls without us even ordering them. Complete disaster of a night."}
{"text":"probably one of the worst ayce japanese sushi place i've been.... 

first off, we came in on a friday night around 8:30pm as a party of 8. the place was not busy at all. we told the waitress we had 8 people and she made us wait around 7mins.... not even sure why bc the restaurant was like 20% full so we could've been seated right away. but whatever not a big deal. next, when we got to our table, we were missing two sets of plates and when we asked the waitress for them, she had the dirtiest look and didn't understand what we were asking for ???? then she only gave us one set. we couldn't even flag down a waitress to give us another set so we had to go to another table ourselves to get another set.

the food is your average ayce sushi taste, not bad but i've definitely had better. some of our orders didn't even come tho. we ordered 3 miso soups as appetizer and we literally got only 1 miso soup at the very end after we got our desserts... lol.... also got a shrimp udon but it didn't look good at all so didn't even bother eating it. looked like there was 2 pieces of shrimp with 50 mushrooms on top. also they don't have a large dessert menu. only have sesame ice cream and no other flavours ???¿

lastly, this was the worst part. we asked for 4 separate bills, and 1 of us paid debit and the other 3 paid cash. me and my bf paid cash and the waitress literally forgot our change .............. at this time it was like 10pm barely anyone left in the restaurant not even busy how can u forget change ....... but remember the other 2 sets of change for our table ..... i work as a waitress as a part time job and i just don't understand how she forgot ??? we had to tell her 10 mins later we are still waiting for our change .... service fee was already included in the bill so no way she would've thought the extra money was tip. 

as u can see i have a lot to say about this place and i will definitely not come back."}
{"text":"First time eating here I would expect a nice meal and I was impressed. The decor of the place is dark but it's catered to fine dining I guess. iPad ordering is fantastic and with pictures as well. The food was very tasty and sometimes a hit and miss on the sauces they used especially on the spicy rolls was not spicy enough. I walked in around 2 pm I guess the lunch crowd was dying down. Could use more dessert options most of the menu items for 13.99 can be full after 1 round."}
{"text":"I feel like cutting and pasting my \"standard AYCE\" review here ...  Hahaha.  They have crab legs on their menu for the weekend meals and they removed the salad and ice cream self serve bar that use to be there - good idea for the salad bar but I sort of liked the ice cream self serve. 

The sushi and good and the iPad assisted service is quick and efficient.

Would come back for larger gatherings and they accept reservations."}
{"text":"Not busy for Thursday lunch AYCE. Decor and atmosphere seemed a bit plain and decent nothing appealing to \"wow\" me. All of the food for lunch AYCE tasted alright nothing fantastic, just good. Yokohama didn't offer as many Special Rolls for lunch than I expected, they only had two. The ability to order through an iPad is really convenient. Service and speed was above average."}
{"text":"This place is crappy.  I've been here a couple times and been disappointed almost every time.   The service is poor and the waiters don't seem to know how to clear plates.  Overall the sushi is mediocre at best. The  other things such a as there dumplings and other appetizers are pretty nasty we tired the sweet and sour  soup and it was like drinking oil.  This place is okay at best would not recommend dinner here there are far superior sushi places.  Save your money and go somewhere ,that actually know there shit cause this place clearly does not."}
{"text":"Lunch was pretty terrible. Maybe we don't know what to order but everything was loaded with rice and nothing was special. Also the orders seemed wrong and they gave us random stuff."}
{"text":"They recently got new management and everything, from food to service, significantly improved! They added a few new menu items that are worth trying (try the tempura squid!). Their new rolls are so good and they don't add a lot of rice like before. They even offer torched sushi during lunch time! Staff is competent and really attentive- great service overall."}
{"text":"I was very satisfied with my AYCE dinner experience here so I returned for lunch soon after. Unfortunately, I wasn't nearly as impressed with the lunch.

Recommendation: It's better value to go for AYCE dinner. 

Food: 3 stars
Food quality was still good but selection was much more limited for the AYCE lunch. Still had a good variety of sushi but many other appetizers seem to only be offered during dinner. It IS a sushi restaurant after all so it's totally dependant on your preference. 

Ambiance: 2.5 stars
The walls and chairs are dark to contrast all the bright strings of light so the place just seems a bit dim during the day with the natural light through the windows. Once again, I recommend coming for dinner. The entire place looks way nicer.

Service: 3 stars
Everything we ordered came. A few items came much later than the rest but that was ok. They actually offer a la carte for lunch as well but they mainly promote the AYCE. Empty dishes were removed periodically and promptly. Service was okay overall."}
{"text":"I took my parents to this AYCE sushi restaurant to celebrate winter solstice.

This is a decent place with self-automated ordering with iPads. The food would come as fast as 2 minutes after submitting your order, which was great in satisfying our hungry souls.

In terms of sashimi variety, they had unique options like sweet shrimp, octopus, squid and Saba herring fish roe (weekends only) - in addition to ones you would normally see at the average AYCE.

The rice-to-fish ratio in the sushi and rolls is acceptable, and the taste was ok. Despite having a large variety of rolls on screen, it felt like they all tasted very similar, suggesting the use of the same ingredients and same sauces at different proportions. 

Overall, a great AYCE sushi restaurant heading in the right direction. At $26.99 + tax per person (weekends would be $2 more), you get what you pay for. Would recommend for random sushi cravings."}
{"text":"Had dinner yesterday, Monday night.  Food is excellent, fresh and lots of selections.  The only complaint I have is that the front lady named May who seats the customers, took away our ipad explaining that they had a 1.5 hour limit.  No one can eat for more than an hour.  We weren't going to order anymore food.  We wanted to laugh, chat and drink tea, unfortunately this restaurant is not the place to chill after you eat.  It just left a bad impression with my family and I."}
{"text":"I recommend that you save your time and money and stay far away from this place. We got the groupon deal and used it on a weekday night for dinner. The food is below average and the service was not so good. We ordered 3 pieces of salmon nigiri and the amount of rice they put in it was ridiculous. Nothing tasted fresh and they would put bizarre ingredients on some of the sushi specialty rolls, like nacho cheese sauce / cheesewhiz, which was very overpowering and did not taste good whatsoever. The servers would also give attitude for no reason at all if we would ask them a question about the menu. The only positive thing about our experience here is that the service was quick, which was probably because there was only about 2 other customers at the restaurant at this time. Also, we were told that there would be an automatic 10% tip added to our bill, but when we got our bill we saw that they charged us a 12% tip. We decided not to say anything about it as it was only 2% and we just wanted to get out of there. 

Please don't waste your time / money here."}
{"text":"Terrible AYCE. I can easily name a few other AYCE places that is better than this, hands down. The sashimi is PRE-CUT, allowing oxidation and bacteria growth. The fried oyster was RAW and UNDERCOOKED. Someone can easily be ill from eating here. The noodle soup is far from the picture shown on the iPad ordering system; not all ingredients was included as shown. Also, all plates and cutlery has a smell of chlorine; very unappetizing. The seaweed salad came flattened as if other dishes was stacked directly ontop of it.  Overall the place seems very unhygienic. For $24.99 with no drinks on a weekday, this was such a rip off. (Just two blocks south from here, $5 cheaper, I could have had AYCE hotpot, drinks INCLUDED, all fresh ingredients and I wouldn't have to worry about eating undercooked/unhygienic foods, IMHO). Never coming back."}
{"text":"I came here with my co workers around 8pm to get dinner. It was pretty full for a weekday, food was typical ayce but the service was horrible. The worst ive ever seen. When my when my co worker went to get spots they told my co worker that they had to wait 15 to 20 minutes and then 2 mins later they told him to wait 20-25 more minutes.My coworker asked them to  confirm a time he had to wait till but she then ignored my co worker and continued to talk to the next customer who was right beside her. When we got ordering food she ignored us many times and did not come for the iPad to confirm our order. She ignored us when we tried to ask them for items like napkins and more tea. When the waiter was picking up the empty plates she accidentally spilled sauce on my hands and  didn't even say sorry. I looked at and she quickly took the plates and left. When we asked a girl to take a group picture for us she looked at us took the camera and asked how to use it. When my co worker took the camera to show her how to use the camera she immediately left and did not take the picture. We gavw minimum tips and quickly left. I would never come here or recommend anyone to come here either."}
{"text":"Good AYCE Sushi place. Tea is free, pop is an extra $1. Service is fast and efficient. BUT it can be too fast. Large orders come lightning fast and you have to eat at ludicrous speeds to keep up, not allowing you to enjoy your meal. Keeping the orders small and ordering multiple times is the way to go. Fish was fresh, rice was cooked nicely. Parking can be a problem on weekends and holidays."}
{"text":"I've only been here for their AYCE dinners so this review is based on my dinner experiences. 

It's about $25/person, AYCE where soft drinks not included. It's definitely worth the money if you go for the seafood. One our favourites is the snow crab legs.  We always order at least 20! They're delicious with lemon juice. (I would assume that the crab legs have been frozen then defrosted since I can taste it in some, however, it's not that obvious).
 If you haven't had Sweet Shrimp then you must give it a go. This is where you'll get most of your money's worth. There's a distinctive taste to these Sweet Shrimp compared to regular shrimp. You just have to try it! 
Did I mention that they have Scallop Sashimi and Baked Mussels?! They also have oysters; limited 2 per person. The only thing is that you'd have to ask for it since they don't mention anything about it. For our first visit we were served with oysters shortly when we were seated (without having to ask). As for our secnd visit, nothing was mentioned by the waiters until my friend asked. So, just remember to ask! 

Their sashimi is fresh and the sushi rolls are great. The only downfall is their fried items. The Calamari is the worst. It always looks burnt and it pretty much tasted like it too. The fried shrimp was not breaded.  It was wrapped in spring roll sheets and it tasted like how it looked. 
They have a variety of desserts and they are generally good. The only thing is that they don't have ice cream on their dessert menu!

Overall, food was great, service was attentive and our orders came generally fast. Modern decor, dim environment and comfortable ambience."}
{"text":"I was not satisfied with the food or services.

I came in for the all you can eat lunch special. The variety and selection of food was very limited. The service was terrible. Our server was not friendly at all and was very unenthusiastic. When asked for a refill of hot tea, she gave us cooled tea. The only person who was welcoming was the manager who actually seemed like he wanted us to be there. He even gave me a discount card at the end. The bill came up to about $40 for 2 people.

The ambiance was not too settling and the place seemed a little unsanitary from stains on the table, to food residue ok the utensils and plates. 

Not recommended for sushi lovers."}
{"text":"I should have listened when my Yelp friend casually mentioned that I don't really enjoy AYCE experience.

This review is based on my lunch experience at Yokohama Japanese Cuisine $13.99 with 15% off if paid by Cash. 

We ordered a whole table of food to try. Personally I think most of the food was a miss.

The only sushi I enjoyed were the hand rolls which were all freshly prepared as the seaweed was still crunchy! Some of the maki rolls were premade as the rice were mushy and hard...  

The buffet area where you supposed to get your own miso soup, lobster soup, seaweed salad, mango salad was just filthy! No one really bother to wipe the area down as the counter was caked with dried soup. The ice cream in the freezer just looked gross and the cake that was set in the open was not too appetizing.

The hot food all tasted similar with similar sauces. The shrimp tempura though was quite good! Chicken wings tasted stale and please don't order the ramen.

Ipad ordering is cool but really they need to improve on the quality of their food! Service was friendly and fast though.

I doubt I would be back."}
{"text":"My family and I stopped by here for dinner during a weekday. We had family friends joining us as well, and he'll, I wish we had made reservations. If not, be prepared to wait for an hour or more. I've never had to wait that long for a table before.

I figured out why...they're under staffed and clearly didn't seem organized. They looked like grinch stole their Christmas. I felt very bad.

They give you iPads to order with, but many of the food we ordered did not arrive, and it was hard getting a server to our table to tell them so. And the food? We had a bunch of everything, quite literally. It was subpar at best - nothing special at all.

All in all, I would make a reservation if you plan on going with a small group, if you're not down to wait over an hour."}
{"text":"Not that great... Everything was so sticky, the plates, the cups, utensils, and table. Items don't look like pictures depicted, which is expected, but they REALLY don't look like it, like 360 change or something. Sashimi was mediocre."}
{"text":"The rating of Yokohama fluctuates so much that I decided the see for myself.  We came for Saturday dinner.  We were delighted by the modern interior decoration and the very large selection shown on the ipad menu.

We ordered a lot of sashimi (2 rounds), and they were ALL very fresh.  I particularly enjoyed the scallop sashimi.  Please note that it was sliced so small that 10 slices could barely satisfy the 2 of us.  Another rare AYCE sashimi offering was raw sweet shrimp.  It was also fresh and very small in size.

We went a little crazy with the Sushi Bar Appetizers.  They all tasted delicious.  The texture of some seemed mushy, but they were so much fun that we could care less.  The shrimp tempura was okay, but the taro and lotus roots tempuras were disappointing.  While the pictures showed them as thickly sliced vegetable tempuras, they were thin like potato chips in reality and fried to crispy.  

Please remember to take a look at the \"Weekend Special\" page on the menu.  For our evening, they offered king crab legs, AYCE upon ordering!!

Unfortunately, to make stomach room, we didn't order much sushi.

There were 2 types of salad (seaweed and pickled radish), and they were equally lovely.  We were not thrilled with the dessert selection on the menu, so we had green tea and red bean ice cream from the buffet bar.  Someone whipped the bar clean frequently during our visit, so it was quite clean and pleasant to use.

The services of the wait staff were friendly and efficient.  However, the kitchen lost some of our orders.  It seems that the ipad ordering is more of a gimmick in terms of ensuring order completion.  A waiter saved the day; he gladly wrote down the missed items by pen and chased them down for us.  Nice.

Yokomama offers one of the higher quality sashimi among the AYCE in the Markham area.  Overall, we enjoyed the meal very much.

UPDATE:  
1) Grand Opening Discount: While there is a 15% discount for lunch if paid by cash, there is only a 10% discount for dinner if paid by cash.
2) Gratitude:  I didn't see an automatic 10% services charge on our dining bill.  So remember to tip!"}
{"text":"Yokohama is an amazing AYCE! I think it depends on what day and the time of day you go because everytime I go, usually a Saturday night, its delicious! The sushi is fresh and its order by ipad! The staff are okay, not the most outgoing but it's tolerable! I guess its hard for them to really make a conversation with you when you order through ipad, all they do is serve you the food, approve the order and then they get on their way! It's a good eat if you're down for lots and lots of good sushi! Definitely better than matsudas for sure!"}
{"text":"Pretty average AYCE sushi, nothing to write home about. And here I am Yelp-ing about it.

Anyways.

Forget the sushi and load up on the oysters and crab legs. The sashimi can be hit or miss (as in cold and fresh versus warm and fishy), so order that at your own risk. Ok, so you might need a couple of rolls to be full but still.

It was worth noting that the service was attentive.

Next!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Nice staff. Pretty fast! Even though I'm starting to not have sushi or take out foods that much anymore this place is always the one that pops up in my head when I think of sushi. Thank you"}
{"text":"Bad service, had died fly on the food and I call them to see and they just take it away and act like nothing happen"}
{"text":"The worst service I've ever had in Toronto. I ordered seafood ramen at $10.95, they tried to change me $13.95. The waitress with short hair is very rude!!!
Never going back. Check your bill!!!! They can overwrite the menu price to whatever they want."}
{"text":"Why would anyone choose to come to this restaurant? One of the worst Japanese AYCE restaurants I've tried ever. I came last year and I'm surprised they haven't run out of business yet. Service was acceptable for a bunch of young people but the food was just terrible. Sushi wasn't fresh. The salad bar looks like a mess and no one bothers to clean it up. The ice cream in the buckets look like they've been messed around by kids. It's not like the price was cheap either; it's around the same as other Japanese AYCE places."}
{"text":"Seems there are not very many all you can eat  buffet type Japanese restaurants in the Markham area. Went to Wasabi's on Hwy 7 only find it out of business (though they still have one operating in Mississauga)

Because my daughter wanted  Japanese, we found this place by accident. This use to be a Eastside Marios. Anyways, seeing the pricing was acceptable, $27.99, we headed in.
From their iPad, We ordered right away about 60 pieces, and within 10 minutes, we got it all!
Salmon was very fresh but the tuna sushi was not too appetizing.

Overall, the food was okay.

Now the men's washroom was a disaster.
Both urinals were closed, and the only toilet was also gross.

Not going back."}
{"text":"Mediocre sushi and food. Flavors are imparted all by the sauces. Employees are nice enough but on our visit, there was a bunch of the staff eating their lunch near us. After they finished, which was quick enough, there were other people who were sleeping in the booths near our table. I thought that was very weird and kind of annoying. Also, there was someone who obviously worked there that was annoyingly clicking a pen impatiently, seemingly waiting for us to go.  This was during lunchtime where the restaurant wasn't even that busy. Honestly, just a sub-par Chinese-run sushi and whatever else food they can cheaply serve restaurant. Boo. Two thumbs down. Liked the ice cream. That's about it."}
