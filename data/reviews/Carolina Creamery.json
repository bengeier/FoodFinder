{"text":"Great little spot - very friendly people - great ice cream! They could use more topping choices - going to try their shake next time!"}
{"text":"I had just read a recommendation of Carolina Creamery by Joe A. and had planned on visiting the shop in Mint Hill. When I did a Yelp search for ice cream, it showed there was another location nearby in Fort Mill.   The shop itself is Spartan with bright blue walls and no artwork. Unfortunately, it has that \"eat your ice cream and go home\" feel. The cashier/\"ice cream scooper\" was really patient and attentive. Four single scoop Kiddie Cups were $10.  The Smurf and Cotton Candy seemed to have plenty of toppings/ingredients blended throughout the ice cream, but the Butter Pecan and Praline flavors had 2 Pecans and one Praline respectively. The base flavors did have a nice homemade creamy taste to them. I did like that they hang kids art work on the bulletin board, their only decoration."}
{"text":"We have been driving by for quite some time time. We stopped in for the first time today. The ice cream is great and plenty of selections. They could use better topping options. They give you a lot for a good price unlike Coldstone. Definitely try it out."}
{"text":"Best homemade ice cream I've had in a while! Great selection of flavors and great affordable prices!"}
{"text":"I decided to go here to see what foods fort mill had to offer.  This establishment is fantastic!  Looks kinda ghetto at first, but glad I went there.  Friendly staff and good value. Decent variety of flavors.  My favorite is smurph!"}
