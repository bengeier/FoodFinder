{"text":"We started off here, by going to Maui Dog, which was closed due to an 8am burglary. Then we tried to keep the Hawaiian theme, and decided to go to Ono Hawaiian Grill. But upon walking into Ono and being overwhelmed by a sewage smell, we quickly turned around and walked in to On the Grill.

I went with the Chicken and Apple Sausage (which was a nice find because so few places will carry this). The sausage was tasty, and the condiments (lettuce, tomato, relish, etc..) all seemed to be fresh and presented nicely. The Fries were good as well. Nothing over the top here, just pretty good food. No complaints from me. The staff was very friendly, and jovial. I will go back if I'm ever in the neghborhood."}
{"text":"We went here attracted to the grand opening banner that advertised $1 hot dogs and $2 burgers.  That sounded yummy, so we decided to check it out.  Pulling up I noticed they advertised real charcoal grilling and sure enough they cook everything to order on a charcoal grill behind the counter.   We were not asked how we wanted the items cooked, but the man cooking the food had been interacting with us, so I asked him to make my two hot dogs well done and he made the perfectly.  The toppings for the hot dogs and burgers looked fresh.  We ordered the macaroni and cheese which was also delicious.  I really wasn't expecting much other than a plain ole' hot dog, but it was really, really good.  We enjoyed the TV's that were playing, they are excellent quality and the world cup was on."}
{"text":"Now thru 6-30-10 you can get a burger, fries, and drink for 3.99. I went today to give it a try. Its a typical hot dog/burger place. Nothing fancy but clean. 

The angus burger is from a preformed patty and comes with lettuce and tomato and a regular sesame seed store bought bun. The produce was nothing special. The meat had a grill flavor to it and was seasoned well enough but it just didn't do anything for me. Nor did the bun. The burger did come with a mountain of fries that had a tiny bit of basil on them. 

I saw several hot dogs being prepared and I wasn't impressed with the look of them. They didn't look bad by any means but they didn't look like I had to try one or come back for one. 

All and all this place was decent at best. I honestly think I'd rather have a whopper. Reason being, the whopper has the same charcoal flavor but the meat is juicier and the bun is even better.  Not to mention when the special is over the price goes to 6+."}
{"text":"Really good place to eat. Burgers are good and the sandwiches too. Their hot dogs are grilled not steamed, way better that way.  The owner is real a real hospitable, friendly guy."}
