{"text":"We absolutely love eating here! The food is excellent, the portions generous, and the pice reasonable. Also, the owners are wonderful people. Introduce yourself to them and they will remember you next time. Some of our favorites are the tortas, chicken soup, flautas, fajitas and huaraches. I have never had anything there that I did not really enjoy. They make everything from scratch and you can really tell. Best corn tortillas I have ever had. Green salsa is mild and delicious. They also have ice old One liter glass bottles of Coke from Mexico and a selection of beers, all served in a huge frozen mug."}
{"text":"I rarely ever leave reviews but this place is fantastic. The service was great and the food was authentic. Great taste !"}
{"text":"Moved here a year ago from Texas, been on a authentic taco hunt ever since. Seems like the hunt finally came to an end. I had the pollo, asada and the lengua taco , they were all top notch. If you are expecting a decked out  taco immersed in all kinds of sauces this is not the place for you. The tacos are topped with onion and cilantro plain and simple as it should be. Make sure to ask for their homemade spicy sauce it's very tasty!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp based on reviews and location.  We were looking for a Tex Mex type place to visit as we traveled to the Charlotte Checkers game on a Friday night along Monroe Rd.  Really bad weather night so we were the only customers in the small restaurant.  Place a just a small business in a small strip shopping center surrounded by Hispanic grocery and a laundry place.  Inside was small with a few booths.  Service and employees were great.  Food was very authentic and prices reasonable.  Family of 3 had nachos and tacos with a side of guacamole.  I highly recommend the guacamole and tacos but you have to enjoy cilantro and onion!   Loved it and will definitely return."}
{"text":"Fresh taste.   Chips if eat in.    New label on Victoria beer  Lots of choices for tacos  Nice lady at the front"}
{"text":"Tucked away, this place seems super authentic, has very nice staff, and everyone loved their food! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Don't let the appearance of this shop (both exterior and interior) stop you from coming in. On that same note, it's not much of a date location. I'd probably stick to takeout. I feel like I've been looking for authentic Mexican tacos around Charlotte for awhile and mostly find some mediocre Tex-Mex food.   I stopped off in here for lunch and the food was as good as described in other reviews. I tried four tacos: steak, chicken, pork, and chorizo. The tortillas were awesome, and would probably call it a tie for best taco between the chorizo and pork. Ordered with some guacamole that was chock full of onions and cilantro. Was a little more like a guacamole salad, but was very tasty. Definitely keeping this restaurant in my rotation, and is right by my neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place is legit. I was hesitant to walk in because it's a true hole in the wall establishment, but so glad we did! Definitely authentic Mexican food. We had chicken, steak, pork (carnitas and pastor), and chorizo tacos along with a tamale. All were delicious and the meal was topped off with homemade tres leche cake. $1.85 tacos for the win!"}
{"text":"Just passing through Charlotte and this place had great reviews. A well hidden gem that's very worth the effort to find. Guacamole and flan are must haves!"}
{"text":"Wow, this Mexican restaurant is quite a find. The food was very good and authentic. They had fajitas and carnitas on the menu so I asked if they would do pork fajitas. No problem, and it was great. I had flan for desert and it was good also. This place was a little hard to find. It is tucked back in the corner of a strip shopping center beside a laundromat. But don't let that deter you. The food and and service were excellent. This place will definitely be on my short list of places to go in south Charlotte when I'm wanting Mexican."}
{"text":"Yup.  This place is the real deal and the food & service is fantastic.  I just had 2 tacos (one carnitas and carne asada, one corn, one flour) and realized I had made a mistake.  I effing LOVE flour tortillas, but they make homemade corn tortillas here and they suggested I order corn.  I didn't listen, but they were totally right.  I ended up going back and ordering another corn carnitas taco.  My sister ordered the Chiro Pollo and it was even better.  I just got back from Baja California Sur a few weeks ago, and this is the best Mexican food I've had since.  Go here and give them your money."}
{"text":"Wow is all I can say. This place is as authentic as it gets. Everything had was phenomenal. It amazes me that people go to huge overpriced under quality spots in south end when the east side has spots like this serving up authentic and extremely affordable plates. If you're at all interested in authenticity visit this place ASAP! You won't be let down."}
{"text":"Went here randomly because I was obviously hungry and it was so delicious! I will definitely be going back as a regular customer. The owner was really nice and the food didn't take long to come out. I ordered their nachos and their tacos and I loved every bite. I also bought their chips that they were selling and my boyfriend and I have been enjoying them! I hope every visit is a good one because I am a fan of this hole in the wall! And it's pretty close by to my house"}
{"text":"There is no way in HELL this place has 5 stars legitimately... they must have paid people to write these or they must be friends of the employees that work here. Extremely mediocre food- not bad but definitely not good- but the real issue here was the service. WORST SERVICE I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. The waitress messed my order up twice (tried to bring back the exact same food), was impossible to find despite us being the literal ONLY table in there, and every time we'd ask for napkins for our extremely greasy tacos she would give us ONE FLIMSY NAPKIN. What exactly are we supposed to do with ONE napkin?! (They don't have them at the table or even near the checkout counter- I can only assume napkins are locked and hidden away in a secret back room where they are treated as gold) absolutely ridiculous. I will never be back and I won't be missing much. This place is an absolute dump, inside and out."}
{"text":"The food was good for the price! Very generous portions of cheese dip. Wait staff was friendly and attentive. I think this is a great choice for a family on a budget. The kids burrito was a great option, they also have chicken nuggets and fries...plus old school glass soda bottles!"}
{"text":"Guacamole is freshly made and absolutely delicious. My husband could not say enough good things about the corn tortillas which are made in house.  Very friendly service and an overall great experience."}
{"text":"They make their own tortillas. For the true taco hunter, the battle is already won. The tacos are fantastic, the Chile verde is fantastic. The chicken soup has me coming back this time, but it could just as easily be the tacos."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the best places I've lived next to for years and never knew about. I'm tempted not to write this so I don't have to wait for my food. But the wait was more then worth it and if you'd like to have real tacos, not what you'd get at the Bell, and for not much more you got to try this place. Excellent food and service. I am so looking forward to returning and trying other menu items. And to be real the tacos aren't big so 3 makes a nice lunch when added to the freshly made guacamole. 2 of us had 2 real Mexican cokes, guac, and 5 tacos for $19."}
{"text":"Alright so I visited this place solely for the 5 star reviews. I got 2 chicken tacos and 2 pork tamales and they were very bland. I had to add salt which is a first for me. This was soooo disappointing especially because of the reviews and the authenticity of the place. I am not sure if I would give them another chance especially since I ended up throwing away one of the tamales because it just wasn't good. I hope folks will get better food then me."}
{"text":"Was hoping for more authentic and this place delivered! They have a somewhat traditional, Americanized menu section but look past that for deliciousness. Tamales, huraches, sopes, street style tacos, all made with fresh masa, on handmade corn tortillas, freshly made guac. So much goodness all made to order"}
{"text":"Hidden in an out the way roadside strip mall. Once you spot the Laundromat you will see this place in the far corner. Windows are covered with posters so it may confuse you on whether it is open or a store. Seating is primarily booths. Interior is simple and lighting is on the dim side. Small but cozy enough.  The food is decent. You can taste the freshness. Chips were warm and crispy. Salsa was mild and not spicy at all. Freshly made guacamole was chunky, limey, and had too much onions in it. I still devoured it. The taco steak meat was seasoned just right but small thin cuts. Tostada was crispy and did not break apart until it became bite-sized. Still good. Rice and beans very good- not overly salty or bland. Burrito needs to be reworked. Looked more like a huge flour tortilla taco and could not be held in hand to be eaten. Regardless, the chicken filling was tender and full of flavor. Horchatas were very refreshing and well made. Served in a large beer glass with plenty of ice. Our waitress was very attentive the entire time. Prices are reasonable. Great local option to add to my eating out rotation."}
{"text":"Nearly hidden from the road in a small strip mall, but well worth the search.  Staff is delightful.  Food is prepared authentically and with a chef's special touch.  Muy Bueno!"}
{"text":"More delicious than I could have expected. Having lived in California for my whole life it's been hard to find Mexican food that hits the spot. The fresh corn tortillas and birria were amazing. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I love this place! I usually pick up but have eaten inside a couple of times. I'm a fan of the asada tacos with the lime and corn tortillas. I ask for shredded cheese on the side and use a little on the tacos and the rest on the yummy frijoles. They have great desserts too. If you call to place an order they are so nice. They are tucked away on Monroe, so if you are driving by and see the yellow Ted's sign, they are right there."}
{"text":"This is a great hole in the wall type restaurant. A hidden gem. The food is very good, and extremely well priced. This is my new favorite lunch place."}
{"text":"Wow!  This is the closest I've come to finding amazing Mexican food since moving from California. Homemade tortillas and flan. This is terrific."}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite little diamond in the rough!  Their food is authentic and always delicious. They have the best guacamole I have ever had and it's always the first thing I order. The staff is very friendly and helpful. I never leave here unsatisfied! Another noteworthy item is the tacos. They are simple but packed full of flavor and the tortillas are made fresh! Part of me wants to tell the world about this place but part of me also wants to keep this little secret to myself. All I can say is you will not regret coming here."}
{"text":"Excellent EXCELLENT authentic Mexican food.  We were tired of eating at the same 2 chain mexican places.   I found this place on YELP and it was the only one that had 5 stars.  The inside is modestly decorated....however, it is very clean.....you can see almost the entire kitchen....its super clean.    The food was tasty and MOST authentic.    Whatever you do, you need to try the corn tortillas.  All the other reviews talked about how cheap the prices were.   I didnt find them \" cheap\".....but it was not expensive.   It could have been the beer and cheese dip that drove up my cost.  This place is a tucked away hidden gem.   Give it a try....you won't regret it.   Its some of the best Mexican Ive had in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I go here when I'm really wanting great tacos! The staff is friendly, the bathroom is clean! I've never had an issue with my food. I love that I can go here and practice speaking Spanish. :-) Food is ready pretty quickly. I usually order Tacos con Pollo Asado and Arroz (the rice on the side). I love the food here!  If you want AUTHENTIC tacos, they won't have cheese. If you want cheese, ask for it. The workers will do their best to accommodate you."}
{"text":"The food is authentic and always great. Staff is super friendly as well. Great food for a great price. The corn tortillas are delicious too."}
{"text":"This was my 1st and only trip here, which is sad because I live right down the road. I ordered 2 steak tacos and one burrito. The burrito was ok but the steak was alittle fatty. The tacos were very unimpressive! They were so small with the same steak meat, onions, and cilantro, no cheese!! Yes, they are only $1.95 but the aren't worth that. This is not what I was expecting and will not go back. The only reason I gave 2 stars, the cheese sauce on the burrito was good and the cook was friendly."}
{"text":"Ay dios mio!! They had me at $1.85 tacos!!! You really have to try their guacamole. Super fresh since they make it to order. Theirs is different since it has diced avocado and fresh pico de gallo. Very good choice. We ordered one of every taco offered and they did not disappoint. The chilaquiles were great as well.  It's a tiny place, but the girls there are very sweet and give great service. Definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"Soooooo good!  Check this little place out!  The tortillas are made from scratch, you can tell instantly.  They are so soft and fluffy.  The cabeza taco was my favorite.  The chicken tacos have little pieces of pineapple diced up in them, really something special.  Try their sopes and guac too!  Very friendly and attentive service!  My new spot."}
{"text":"Maybe I came here on an off-day? I found this place from fellow Yelpers and decided to give it a shot because I wanted authentic Mexican. Office lunch with Irma was the theme, but that's not very applicable.  Anyways, I ordered 5 tacos (all for me.) I ordered two steak tacos, two pork, and one chicken. On the side, I also got a tamale. Seeing everyone's reviews on the tacos made me want to pig out. I loved the tortillas. They were made fresh in house and were nice and soft. Unfortunately, the meat that I got was very dry and flavorless. There were a lot of onions on the tacos which took away from the flavor of the meat. My tamale on the other hand was very good!  My co-worker got guacamole and two sopes. Her guacamole had a lot of pico, to where it was almost a guacamole salad. She thought her sopes were tasteless and doughy. Also, they forgot the chips, but I should have checked that before I left. I'll take the blame for that.  Again, maybe I came on an off day. The staff was very nice, made you feel at home, and service was very prompt. I'll probably give this restaurant another try soon. I just wasn't impressed this time.  Those tamales though.. I could eat like 8."}
{"text":"Authenic flavor! Cozy environment! Great restaurant!!! Tried the place When we first moved to charlotte, it has become a regular place especially on Taco Tuesday! They serve some of the best guacamole I've ever tasted! Highly recommend this place"}
