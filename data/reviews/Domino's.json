{"text":"Terrible location,short changed me and missing the sauce.Like 10 people working here but very disorganized."}
{"text":"First of all I would like to say that I am absolutely disgusted by your customer service. I placed an order via telephone for the $11.99 large pizza with four toppings (which I have always ordered) in the past and did not obtain the pizza after an hour mark. I called and they had asked me if I did an online order and I was speaking to the same person who took my order on the phone. I knew right then and there that they had not made my pizza by the tone in his voice and it took another 20 minutes for the pizza to come. He told me on the phone he would waive the delivery fee and once the pizza finally came the total was $19 without the delivery charge. After an hour and a half of waiting to have to pay $19 when the pizza was advertised as $11.99. He told me on the phone that he was cancelling the order after refusing to give me the pizza for $11.99 plus tax and told the delivery man to bring back the pizza. I am never ordering from here again.

To add, on previous occasions they refused to deliver because it was out of their area (a 6 minute drive). Some days they would and I have no idea what they base this on... what a horrible location!!!"}
{"text":"I don't write reviews of places but I actually got a yelp account to write this review. Worst pick-up experience of my life. First, I call, the guy picking up mumbles, asks me to repeat my phone number then interrupts me, tries to hang up on my before I'm done my order, and makes weird mistakes (I ask for a small coke, he asks if I want 1.5L). They then tell me half an hour which seems long for a one pizza order but I go there and am amazed to see the most employees I have ever seen working at a pizza place at one time (10-15). No one greets me or tries to help me when I walk in. They ask me if I had an order that's not mine. They finally find and punch in my order but charge the wrong special (1 topping special add 3 toppings, instead of 4 topping special) so I have to ask them to change it. Then their debit card machine is broken and the guy offers me a portable one with a $1.50 fee. I leave without checking the order and come home to find the wings are plain and have no BBQ sauce on them and the pizza is ice cold. Worst experience ever with what should have been a simple order. Will not be returning. Avoid this place! 0/5"}
{"text":"Had a walk in order that took 3 tries to get right - once 'forgetting' our order then the second time with the wrong ingredients (a veggie pizza was covered in pepperoni).  A refund was not granted despite multiple requests. Enjoy our $12, will never be back."}
{"text":"The Best Dominos Pizza I Have Ever Eaten. And As A Plus. I Received A Coupon In The Mail For A Free Medium 2 Topping Pizza Welcoming Me To The Neighborhood. The Staff Was Polite. The Store Was Clean. Kudos to Coleen. Thanks!"}
{"text":"How do you mess up the exact same order that is ordered every weekend for the last 6 months? Happened 8 times and I kept ordering like and idiot then I stopped for a bit go to order again and surprise surprise order is wrong again. How can you miss a topping on a pizza when it is always stressed to you over the phone to make sure it's on there? I don't understand how this keeps happening and where you guys at the store are getting confused? Then told deal with the pizza you get a credit next time you order? Who says I want to order again after all this? Is it being done on purpose to piss me and my family off? I will be making sure now that anyone I know will no longer be ordering from you absolutely the worst customer service I have ever seen. When we used to order from the Kingston store before you opened I didn't have one issue EVER! Disgusting how you treat your customers let alone can't get an order right how many times? My favourite pizza in toronto and this is what I have to deal with just to get one simple topping on a pizza?"}
{"text":"Called and verified my order ahead of time. Arrived early and saw my name on the tv. Order was suppose to be ready. I waited for 10 minutes and asked where my order was, another employee said it was in the oven. My name disappeared and I asked again 10 minutes later and apparently my order wasn't processed at all. I paid when I got there so there is no excuse for this. Employee in training made the error but did not tell me when I got there, when I asked 10 minutes before or after 10 more minutes when I had to find out myself. The senior employee offered a free dipping sauce or pop and I refused. I had to demand a refund several times before receiving it. Mistakes happen but don't prolong a mistake or try to avoid it. Even worst, lie about it, this is what upset me the most. What a waste of time."}
{"text":"This is a great location on College St. They make a good quality slag and are very friendly with some of the best of the best when it comes to cheery delivery dudes. The Domino's web page works well with a streaming rundown of how your order is coming along. And their desserts are yummy! The pasta dishes are pretty good and the parmesan bites are a tasty snack."}
{"text":"It's good. Just for an emergency it's great! I just ordered take out and upon reaching my order was ready. Maybe the customers are not much here. And I was shocked the girl was all alone to handle the Dominos. Looks like soon it will be closed! Sad..."}
{"text":"this location must be new last time i try to order the closest store was over by 7 and finch and i couldn't even set an order for delivery via the app.

so i had an special that is probably going to be gone soon for 1 large 2 topping  and 2 litter drink. for 11.99 with tax and delivery it was 16 which isnt bad i think they have large 4 topping for 11.99 so its all good.

so i placed order slightly before 530 and pizza arrive around 6 which isnt bad given i forgot to mention the location i was at didnt have parking lot. 

pizza was good. crust was cooked well. wasnt doughy and topping tasted great. no issue with food at all. not under or over cooked and it was pretty timely for delivery. 30 to 40 for everything is pretty good in my books."}
{"text":"Fantastic online order system. Very nice Dominos!  I was able to use my credit card and it was so easy!"}
{"text":"Horrible business. If you pay for delivery the driver has to come upstairs, which is why people pay for it (for the convenience!) There is another location (Hwy 7 and Pine valley) which I now ask for delivery from and they are 100x better."}
{"text":"Trying to order a pizza but they won't answer their phone. I've been trying for 30 minutes now and it's 151 am wtf"}
{"text":"The pizza was decent and the price was ok.  However, for delivery I expect the driver to come to my door like every other pizza place.  When I questioned the driver, he said he has no problem going to the door and if the customers insist, he will.  He said it is the restaurant which tells drivers to SAVE TIME by making them meet the driver in the lobby or by their car.  He said he has never been told of any issues for safety which is the excuse I was given.  I will stick to giving my money to an honest place which actually delivers when they charge for delivery."}
{"text":"Chronically forgets my order. They serious need to fix their tracking system so they don't keep forgetting peoples order. Ended up waiting 45 minutes for an order."}
{"text":"I order from this dominos quite a bit. I've been using online ordering, which is pretty simple. I like that it has a pizza tracker. It tells you when they receive your order, start making it ,goes in the oven & ready for pick up. The only bad thing about online ordering is sometimes the special don't work and when you call your order in, they don't honor the online coupons. Other than that, the staff is usually friendly. Pizza always hot & taste good. Sorry I couldn't get any pictures, but the pizza was so good , my family ate it all up before I had a chance to snap a pic!"}
{"text":"Truly a 3.5 star experience.  Was stuck in traffic and drove by fanzine swings were off the list.  Saw a few banners for this new Domino's establishment and stopped by to grab a quick bite.  Service is quick, attentive and food is A-OK for a chain run operation.   Being today was the grand opening, let's revisit this place in the near future to see which direction it has gone.  In a pinch I would come back and grab another pie at a very decent price

Clean, brightly lit with usable washrooms inside.  If they only had a serving of free WiFi then it would be a nice hangout joint."}
{"text":"I ordered multiple sauces and extra cheese on my pizza. I got barely the normal serving of cheese as well as NO sauce. When I told the delivery driver I didn't get my sauces he told me he would bring them back. He called shortly after and send his manager didn't show a receipt for them so he wouldn't be bringing them back. The sauces were on my receipt and when I called and told him that he said he would need me to send him a copy of my receipt but sauces weren't enough for them to send another driver out. Will NOT order again."}
