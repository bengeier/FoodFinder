{"text":"Soo good! Had the Crispy Patas, and they were amazing."}
{"text":"We ordered a pancit bihon and it was so good but then all of a sudden while I was enjoying my food, I chewed this hard wire like. I don't know what wire is this but I hope you guys should be careful while you cook your foods. The place is very nice as well as the foods are really authentic. Just be more cautious in preparing foods."}
{"text":"Newly opened location for the same business located off Flamingo. Same quality food and more dining area space in my opinion. They have been open for 2 weeks when I visited so their menus and other \"branding\" still have the Flamingo location info.

The front of the restaurant is not visible from Las Vegas Blvd. You do see the rear entrance and while you are able to enter from there, the main entrance is just around the corner.

Looking forward to enjoying more of the same food from this business at their new location."}
{"text":"Great place for  Filipino food. Nice ambiance, friendly service n good food. Prices are very reasonable. We ate the ukoy palabok chicharon bulaklak pansit bangsilog n halo halo."}
{"text":"Great food and prices are reasonable. I like their Bulalo it is really tasty! Must order first because it takes longer time to cook and one bowl can feed up to 3 persons. The place is clean and decent location next to outlet mall. We went during lunch hour and they seem pretty busy but we did not wait too long for our order. They only had one young female server who seems really nice. I will go back and would like to try their desserts!"}
{"text":"By far this is the best Filipino restaurant in Vegas. I discover this in yelp and noticed the ratings is getting 5 stars, I ask myself, this must be a joke since I rarely see perfect score and this restaurant just open 2 months ago. Is located in the South Las Vegas Premium Outlet, good place to dine in after a long shopping day. I went and tried 5 dishes plus halo halo, Surprisingly, this is authentic Filipino food can be. I was very satisfied on all the dishes, I will Surely be coming back."}
{"text":"Went here with two coworkers for dinner. The food was amazingly delicious and rather inexpensive with great portions! I will definitely return my next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Been searching for a Filipino restaurant that is close to me. Decided to check this place out. I really like the modern look inside the restaurant. As far as Filipino food, this is authentic as it gets. Reminds me of my dad's cooking. Tried the chicken skin since it was recommended on past yelp reviews. I have to say it was really good. I ate the oxtail kare kare and the milk fish sinigang. It was great. Lastly, I had the halo halo for dessert and it was perfect to end the meal. All in all, I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"While visiting my wife's aunt.  We ate at \" D Pinoy\" restaurant  and the pinoy food was fantastic.  However, the service fee and tip were misleading on the bill.  We wound up paying a tip (our choice) and a service fee charged (without our consent).  Not happy about this, especially with an automatic charge (service fee).  Will think twice before coming back. $19 service fee + our tip."}
{"text":"Excellent food which reminds me of being back in the islands! Friendly staff and reasonable prices. A must if you're craving traditional Filipino food."}
{"text":"Came here straight from the airport.  So convenient,  about a mile away from the car rental facility.

The place is very clean. The servers were very friendly and greeted us as soon as we walked into the restaurant.

Food was delicious.  Everything was freshly made.  Had the palabok and chicharron bulaklak. The palabok had  a lot of shrimp and other mixed ingredients in the sauce. It also had a good amount of crunchy cracklings and hard boiled egg slices.   Wish it had calamansi instead of lime.  The chicharron bulaklak was very light and crisp. Not oily at all.

I wanted to order the halo halo but didn't have enough room... may make a trip here just for the halo halo."}
{"text":"Just stumbled on to this place a couple days ago. My wife is Pinay and from Pampanga, which is known for its good cooking. We have looked for really tasty, authentic Filipino dishes here in Las Vegas and we have finally found it. The service is also authentic, very welcoming, friendly and our servers were attentive and helpful. The food was excellent with large portions, with more than enough rice, rather than the usual less than ample found in most restaurants. 
The menu is extensive so if you enjoy the food of the Philippines, you'll most likely find your favorite here. Kelsey, Andy, and Paul were the servers taking care of us...and no doubt they will impress you as well. 

The interior of the Las Vegas Blvd \"Pinoy Joint\" restaurant appeared very clean and well maintained. Outside there was plenty of parking.  

A big thumbs up for \"Pinoy Joint\"... we are looking forward to our next visit.

Joe and Regina"}
{"text":"Awesome food and service was fast.  I would definitely recommend this place.  Would come back again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Came to visit Vegas and found this place after flying in. Ordered the lunch special with dinugs and chicken adobo. Had the dinugs and shared  the chicken with my daughter and it's definitely kid approved. The dinuguan had the right amount of spice and vinegar. She finished all her food and any place that can feed a picky eater is a good find in my book. And to top it off, we enjoyed the karaoke music playing.....thx for keeping us content. Would come back if I ever came back."}
{"text":"There are subtleties in dining in a Filipino restaurant. There are Americanized Filipinos who have acculturated to the US ways, and there are the older Filipinos who have  held on to their traditions. Neither is better or worse, just different. In dining in this restaurant, I saw the intricate subtleties where, the chef, owner, and staff danced around these beautiful intricacies with so much grace. While dining in, I loved the food: however, it became secondary to me because I was was watching the theater in front of me. The mastery that the staff showed in respecting the elders, entertaining them, making them remember the beautiful ways of the Philippines. I just found a Filipino restaurant that not only can serve me great food but also redolent of home."}
{"text":"Visiting from Cali and saw good review from yelp. Went and ordered lechon kawali so good.  Bihon/canton pancit was also good . Everything we ordered was great except the pinakbet. Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Soul satisfying Filipino food. Come as you are and be yourself. Longsilog. Lechon Kiwali. Bistec. Kare-kare. Rice. What else do you need besides to keep coming back."}
{"text":"We decide to give this place a try after reading the reviews. We walked in and were not greeted and by looking at the clientele, this probably was a bad idea. 
I used the restroom to wash my hands and the restroom was filthy (see image). We ordered a few items and the young server rudely brought our dishes out without saying a word and walking off. Anyhow, the Laing dish was way too salty. The Pinakbet flavor was plain and was missing something. The oxtail kare kare was pretty good and for desert, the halo halo was disappointing. For $6.99 I would expect a halo halo like full house BBQ. It lacked a lot of toppings and was mostly shaved ice."}
{"text":"My favorite Filipino restaurant.  Awesome food and great service.  We visit every time we are in the area."}
{"text":"The best Filipino resto I've been too so far. Excellent service, friendly staff and clean. Good thing I took my auntie's advice. Palabok was excellent."}
{"text":"MASARAP is a Filipino word for delicious. This is the exact word to describe their food dishes at D'Pinoy. We tried their Tapsilog, Lechon Kawali, and Beef Kaldereta and they were Masarap.  

The place is nice and clean. The food prices are very reasonable especially in comparison to other local restaurants. The customer service are excellent. This is our first time here and we definitely be back soon with families and friends.  

Lastly, please try their Halo-Halo too. It is just Masarap too.  

I wrote this review because i want people to know this nice restaurant in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"A awesome Filipino place. Great for family dinners. Really nice and clean. Lots of choices to choose from as well."}
{"text":"The food is really good.  We had ordered from the Kamayan Menu.  Everything we picked were great especially the Crispy Pata and Okoy.  The only disappointing dish was their pancit, but will go back again and try other dishes."}
{"text":"I usually order take out but this time decided to eat in. It took awhile for the waitress to come and order our food. However at that time the waitress did not ask if we would like water or any beverages. It took about 15 mins for me to finally say something. If you are willing to wait for a long time for someone to take your food order and to receive your food, then this is he place. Other than that I recommend to order take out than to eat in. Then for over 30 mins the staff has not cleaned up a table. See picture provided."}
{"text":"Good food friendly stuff they have the best okoi, crispy pata , sisig my family likes it"}
{"text":"After many attemps to find an open Filipino restaurant, we found one! And were we glad to try D'pinoy Joint.

Walking in, the decor and ambiance is very home-y and casual. Many times, when I enter restaurants, the environment plays a big role with my experience. I'm happy to say that this place gave off a \"I'm comfortable and ready to chow down and loosen my belt without judgement\" type of vibe. 

We were immediately greeted with smiles and enthusiastic hellos from the staff. It wasn't very busy at 1pm on a Monday afternoon. There were 3 of us. I'm the local one and the other two from out of town. We sat down and waters came out immediately. I have a 1-2minute mark on waters being brought out.

The menu at this place is expansive. We chose to order crispy pata binagoongan, kare-kare and pork sisig. 

The kare-kare came out first. 
The creamy, peanut butter sauce and the oxtail in that dish was just perfect. I'm picky with my kare-kare because my mom creates and crushes peanuts to create the family sauce recipe BUT I would say that I thoroughly enjoyed D'Pinoy's approach on this dish as well. 

The pork sisig came out next; this dish steamed and sizzled from the moment it left the kitchen. We wondered how our waittress carried it to our table with all the amazing flavors crackling. The sisig had the perfect crunch, crack and pop lol. The sour and savory flavors mixed well. It may have been slightly too hot due to the pork sticking slightly to the sizzle pan.

Last but not least was the crispy pata binagoongan. This dish is huge. 3 of us together could not finish it. It was definitely crispy, full of meat and absolutely delicious. The pork skin wasn't rubbery. The binagoong on it was drizzled; you can order it on the side but I believe it's always better to just have it all mixed in. 

The service was great at this restaurant. Staff was making jokes and really providing a fun and family-style atmosphere. We definitely needed boxes so they provided those. Check came out. Payment was easy (they don't take discover cards). 

We left with full stomachs and the desire to come back. We were going to check out red canyon and we HAD to go home to make sure we left the leftovers in the fridge. It was THAT good. 

ENJOY :)"}
{"text":"Tried this place a week ago and I must say it's probably one of the best Filipino cuisine we've tasted. Service and food presentation was also great. Will definitely go back again and recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"This is the place to get Filipino food if you visit Vegas.  We ordered Crispy pata, pansit canton, and bistek and everything was freaking good!  The crispy pata alone is worth the visit here.  Very crispy, not oily, and plentiful with skin and meat.  
Yum!"}
{"text":"I went to this location on a few occasions, and the service and food can be a hit and miss. However, the service and food was excellent tonight. I prefer this location over the Flamingo location because they tend to be busy at Flamingo and forget about their customers. Waiters and waitresses are friendly and attentive at the Las Vegas blvd location. They also have TFC playing on the tv. Serving portions are huge and they have a lot of options on the menu."}
{"text":"You should definitely check this place out!! Food are delicious. Generous servings. Lots of options. Very affordable. And  friendly and attentive staff. 

I ordered the lunch special for $8.49. 
Available Monday-Friday 10am-4pm."}
{"text":"Enjoyed breakfast with the family. Surprise live acoustic entertainment made our breakfast eggstra-special :D"}
{"text":"Food was really good here, if you like Filipino food its definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Uber driver hubby stopped here for lunch. It's a seat-yourself place; which he did. There were other customers but not super busy.  Sat for 10 minutes without being acknowledged and left."}
{"text":"A good Fil-Am friend and I ate here recently. Chicken and pork BBQ skewers were extremely tasty. Fried rice was enough for two or three people. Definitely a \"family style\" restaurant in how you order and are served - it's a good place for family dinners or group get togethers. Service was good humored and attentive, dining room was relentlessly clean and well-lit. Very nice casual dining experience overall."}
{"text":"Better location. Cleaner location. Food tasted good. Service was great. Make room for halo halo."}
{"text":"Very good Filipino food and excellent service. It's far and few between that I get to have good Filipino food back in the states, and Lucky to have been recommended such a good place to eat. We had the chicken skin, okoy, adobong pusit, and paksiw na lechon. Food was very tasty and restaurant is clean. Will definitely be coming back next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Large seating area. Lots of Filipino families eating at this restaurant. The crispy pata or pork knuckle looked delicious in their kamayan or Filipino feast. The Halo-Halo dessert was huge. I wish I had the appetite to eat it all. We popped by D'Pinoy to pick up some Pancit Beehoo or fried rice noodle for my son. We got it with chicken without the shrimp. 

It took a while for our order to be completed. In the time we waited for our take-out order, we should have enjoyed a Halo Halo. However, we were too stuffed from our lunch. The food smelled fabulous as we watched various dishes delivered to different tables.

When we finally tasted the Pancit Beehoon, it was okay. The acid from the lemon was too strong for the subtle flavors. They gave us a generous portion. I would've like to have given it more stars, but it wasn't one of the greatest pancits I have enjoyed. I would love to go back and try some of the other dishes I saw."}
{"text":"This has to be so far my favorite Filipino restaurant in Vegas. Food is great and customer service is awesome!!"}
{"text":"My dad brought me here for breakfast and I'm glad he did. You can get fat on a variety of affordable food, from simple Filipino style breakfast plates to specialty fried a la carte items like the Milk Fish and the Fried Eggplant. Straightforward, friendly, to the point. Vegas has a lot of good breakfast and brunch options but I'd rather come here for my fried breakfast fix."}
{"text":"Great service.  Friendly staff.  Most of all, the food served are all freshly cooked and delicious.  Almost better than my mother's cooking!  We ordered Togo food the first night and then came back to eat at the restaurant with the family and ordered kamayan .  Their Kare kare is excellent.  We also had halo halo. A must try when you visit Las Vegas ."}
{"text":"Love their combos on the menu.. Everything here is pretty much really good and clean! If you've never been yet you better check it out! Service is fast and servers are friendly!"}
{"text":"D'Pinoy Joint 2 is just as amazing as the one on Flamingo. Great location close to the South Las Vegas Blvd Outlet Mall. Eat some authentic Filipino food for lunch and then head to the mall and walk off the Beef Calderetta and Lechon Kawali. After the wife racks up the cards, come back for some Crispy Pata and sizzling Sisig!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent!! Service improved as the time went by. Looks like a great option for carry out."}
{"text":"Plenty of seating inside. The food here is one of the better ones for the south side. Only thing is the Entree got done before the appetizer. Which we only got fish balls. The service here is not bad and the staff checked up on us allot.  I would definitely recommend this place again."}
{"text":"This branch is more vibrant and service is great. Love the beef bulalo , crispy pata, chicharon bulaklak, kare kare and sisig."}
{"text":"this pinoy resto is super clean, very nice ambiance and friendly staff. the food taste really good.. kare-kare is a must!  5 stars is not enough"}
{"text":"I went here right after I landed and wow was it delicious. The place was very clean and the customer service was amazing and fast. Really loved it here and it made me miss the Philippines. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Super tasty. Grilled bangus was huge with no bones and delicious. Kare Kare was also cooked really well. Soft oxtail and the sauce was very light but flavorful. Some of my favorite Filipino food in awhile. Staff was nice too."}
{"text":"Ang sarap naman ang D'Pinoy Joint!!! My family and I love coming to this place whenever we want Filipino food. The service is great as the restaurant itself doesn't have much customers, so there's never a wait. Of course, the food is really good, and it brings a positive outcome to pinoy food. It's pretty pricey, but it's understandable. 100% recommend!!!"}
{"text":"The food here isn't like your typical Filipino food...it's not overly greasy (extreme plus). You can really taste the quality of ingredients they use and they don't use a lot of oil like other Filipino restaurants. There's a lot of selections to choose from; I recommend the beefsteak. The restaurant is super clean, casual, and simple. It's a sit down restaurant and the staff is super friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"D Pinoy just added to the diversity of restaurants close to the south outlet mall.

And the fact that it's close to work and they have awesome lunch specials just make it more convenient for me.

Never had a bad experience at this place. Quality of food is great.

Just like in other Filipino restaurants, Sundays lunch time could get very busy."}
{"text":"Pretty good Filipino food with enough variety for everyone to savor. Crispy pasta, Kare Kare, pork barbecue, bagoong fried rice is just right not salty like other places, halo halo and more....I'll have to go back to try the other dishes. I've been here 4 times and so far it's consistently good, efficient service and friendly staff."}
{"text":"When comparing this place's food to other Filipino restaurants in the area I'd probably give it 4 stars. Ordered the sisig, kare-kare, shanghai lumpia, and bistik and all of it was super yummy. The bistik (beef steak and onions) was particularly good because they grilled the onions way down which I prefer. Got an order of halo halo as well for dessert and it was very yummy. The prices are very affordable as well. 

The 3 stars is comparing it to other  restaurant in its price range. The service was not so great, took a long time to get orders and water refills. However, thats typical of Filipino spots."}
{"text":"Pros: Absolutely affordable, great portions, a lot of seating, ample parking at the back, very clean, food is delish and good quality for fast food, friendly staff. 

Cons: Music was a bit loud and it's all tiled so it sounds louder than it probly is."}
{"text":"The food is great and location is in a good area. First time eating at this place and did not dissapoint. Servers are cool as well. I would come back again when I need that home filipino flava which is almoat an everday thing. Anyways a good recommendation restaurant to try out for all the travelers who never had filipino food, not to mention ita close to the chain hotels... marriott, hilton etc."}
{"text":"Good crispy pata! Went on a Sunday afternoon, so it was understandably busy, but it took 20 min to get our order taken, another 10 min to get drinks, and another 30 min to get our food. People who came in after us with the same size party were eating well before us. 

Other than that, the food was great!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, I'm so stoked to have a Filipino restaurant by my house. The entire staff is very friendly, and referred to me by name after coming in and asking question about their menu. I ordered the lunch special for $7.99 which comes with choice of two sides and rice. ( totally reasonably priced) I chose beef kaldereta and chicken adobo as those are both two of my favorite dishes. I also ordered a side of lumpia, because Lumpia is life! The atmosphere is chill, quaint and very clean! I recommend to anyone who loves Filipino food as much as I do!"}
{"text":"Really good!! Crispy Pata is to die for and the BBQ chicken! Actually better than Max's restaurant"}
{"text":"I'm always happy to support new pinoy spots so I was delighted when this place opened. The food was good and the owners were very accommodating. They have a family deal that allows your group to mix and match dishes and sides and then it's served like a mini boodle fight for $59.99 which we found to be a great deal. Some days they have a performer that serenades the diners which was also pretty cool. Come check them out."}
{"text":"Absolutely my favorite Filipino restaurant in Las Vegas.  Very good quality authentic home taste in all dishes and deserts.  I have tried pretty much everything and all dishes breakfast to dinner all recommended.  Highly recommended place to eat."}
{"text":"LA hat masatap, yummy food... they do have avacado shakes though and it's nice...it was  better then expected..pork adobo was great.. no WiFi and they have separate bathrooms for men and women.. really down the street from the welcome to Las Vegas sign."}
{"text":"Pretty good for Filipino food.  Nice clean place and big area. Convenient location at the South Premium Outlet Malls - they also serve their breakfast dishes all day!  Very nice service - a good place to go for groups too!"}
{"text":"bought sour pork saturday nite. i was dissappointed. meat was not fresh. i end up throwing food away"}
{"text":"First and LAST time here, service is slow and our server was rude. She cant even say hello, she drops the menu and doesn't come back for almost 10 mins. The customers after us received their water before us too, what the hell is wrong with that picture. Service has to be number with me and this place doesn't cut it. The place is not even busy, common people."}
{"text":"I don't understand the positive reviews for this place, sorry.  The first time I came in here, the service was friendly but the food was alright at best.  The bangus sisig had far too many peppers and not enough bangus, and they let us order different desserts three times, only to come back to the table each time to let us know they were out of it.  

The second time, I came with some friends and family with high expectations.  I arrived to the restaurant earlier than the rest of my family and ended up having the waitress ask me if I \"meant\" to be in there, and not the El Salvadorian place next door I'm assuming because of my appearance.  Although I am often mistaken for Latina, I am Filipino and I also know how to read so yes, I knew which establishment I was in.

Moving onto the food, the beef caldereta was watery.  It didn't seem like the ingredients were actually cooked together.  The stew meat seemed to be cooked very quickly which made it tough and chewy.  Again, they were out of most of their desserts so we were forced to order the turon which came out so soggy it was inedible.  

Overall, I can't say I'll be back here.  Not comparable to home cooking at all. The service and the food left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Food was amazing!!! If you're ever around this area make sure to come get some great Filipino food."}
{"text":"We tried this place twice during our most recent trip in Las Vegas and we were not disappointed. The food is absolutely amazing. We ordered lechon kawali, bulalo, etc. but I enjoyed the grilled boneless bangus and grilled pusit the most. Staff is nice too (not the typical filipino snobs when they work in food service, if you know what i mean). I will definitely be back here."}
{"text":"Great Filipino food. Nice clean restaurant and friendly. Will return when I'm in town. Ordered pancit bihon and I wasn't disappointed! Great prices. Picked up a few to/go pre-made desserts that were very good."}
{"text":"I came her yesterday for lunch and it was delicious. Tastes very home cooked and is the best Filipino food that I have had in Vegas other than my boyfriend's mom's cooking. My boyfriend and I had the lunch specials. I had the Chicken Adobo and a BBQ Pork Skewer and he had the Lechon Koawali with the Pork Skewer. They were both so good! My 10 month old even enjoyed them. The atmosphere is comfortable and clean and the staff is very courteous. We will be returning very soon with the rest of our family :)"}
{"text":"Best customer service, good quality good and definitely coming back here when I go back to vegas"}
{"text":"Pork sinigang was served hot and tangy (maasim)...as it should be. Staff was very friendly. Place is very clean and not far from the Strip. I will return for sure. I want to try their pork belly with eggplant (binabagoonan). Portions here very generous.

Crispy chicken skin did not disappoint. Served with suka dipping sauce."}
{"text":"Based on their food alone, I would have loved to have given them more stars because it IS really good. The staff although polite, needs a LOT of training.  We were barely seated and given menus when one came immediately to ask if we were ready to order.  We asked for more time.  After probably 20 seconds, the other waiter came to ask if we were ready to order.  We felt that we were being rushed because lunch time was about to begin.  It was our first time there so we had no idea what their menu was all about.  Just a tip, when you see your diners obviously browsing through the menu, they are not yet ready.  But when they put down the menu or when they start looking around, then they are ready to order or they have questions about the menu.  So after we placed our order, our waiter came to serve us our drinks.  The soda cans were inside the glasses, sitting on top of the ice.   Boy, both my husband and I were aghast!  Can't get rid of the unwanted image in my mind wherein the germs found under the soda can were now crawling towards the ice that we were about to drink!  I get that he has only 2 hands and that he had to carry 2 glasses and 2 soda cans but hasn't he ever heard of a serving tray?!  Then we noticed that none of the 2 waiters manning the whole lunch crowd were using any serving trays.  We thought that maybe it's too tough for them to balance the trays while they try to maneuver the very tight restaurant space.  The restaurant has too many tables for the space.  They placed a series of connected small tables to form a very long table in the middle of the restaurant, almost occupying the full length of the dining area.  Even we had a very hard time maneuvering that series of long connected tables just to walk to our table by the wall.  By the end of our meal, our waiter asked if he can put away the dishes.  We said, \"Sure, go ahead!\"  Then right there on our table, while we were still trying to finish our drinks, he started pouring, accumulating all of our leftovers into one container with some of the contents spilling over and splattering all over our table!  The waiter tried desperately to stack up all of the variously sized dishes and bowls into one column so as not to make 2 trips in putting away the dishes.  My husband even tried helping him out several times because some of the dishes started tipping over.  I got stressed just watching him do it lol!  Hopefully they get their act together because I like this place!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at their original location on Flamingo and had to try their new location. Immediately loved the place very clean and it has a new look. The staff was pleasant and immediately sat us. My family ordered and was very happy to see that their selection was plenty. We ordered a few things to try and they were all delicious. They also have an option to order for a family size combo. See some of the food we ordered"}
{"text":"Aug. 22/2017 10:30 am
Late breakfast at D' Pinoy Joint Las Vegas Blvd with my Wife and son, John. There's nothing like dining at our favorite Pinoy restaurant. We ordered lunch special today (lechon kawali/kare-kare) @ $7.99, bang-silog and long-silog, diet coke in can is $1.50. We're happy to have met with the D' Pinoy staff KATHY today and LEN. We always love to hang out here everytime we get a chance coz  Prices are reasonable The ambience is great, toilet is clean, (which I'm very particular with) they have wide parking area and located around the Las Vegas premium outlet which is just a few miles from the strip. Thank you Kathy for such a warm hospitality. Back soon for my Lomi soup!!!"}
{"text":"I think If had a bad taste from other locations , was weary I'm trying again. Glad I did! The place was clean, and simply decorated. They were adequately staffed.  We ordered several staple filipino dishes and they did not dissapoint! Bangus  (milkfish) Sisig gave away an  aroma of ginger and peppers , and the Bicol Express,  (pork belly in coconut milk and spices) was creamy like chowder on a cold day. The mentioned were just my favorites. Service was fast and we were checked on frequently. Definitely returning for their lunch specials during the week!"}
{"text":"We came in for dinner yesterday and today. The restaurant is very nice and the staff is very friendly. Love the food my favorite is the chicken curry and the lumpia. My husband had the  kalderetang kambing it was delicious. This is now our favorite Filipino restaurant when we visit Vegas and will be recommending it to all our friends and family. We will be back after shopping later to try out the Halo, Halo."}
{"text":"Best adobo I've ever had. Though I was a bit miffed as we walked in at 3.55pm and orders were taken just after 4pm we were told the lunch specials are over at 4pm."}
{"text":"I love this Filipino restaurant... the food quality is great. And they have funny staff too.. hehe.. i just forgot the name.. they make the best pansit! my favorite:)"}
{"text":"A must go... really good food for cheap price.. the place is clean as well... I definitely recommend it"}
{"text":"Great place to dine! Dishes are good for more than one person. I ordered chicken abode and it was heavenly."}
{"text":"It was a hard choice between real lechon or lechon belly only. We decided on lechon belly from D'pinoy joint and it was a HIT on our son's 1st Birthday Party, along with our other order. It was sinfully crispy and flavorful. They make it cebu style. All my friends now wants it for their party!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good, food is tasty, place is clean, prices are reasonable. The only reason for the 3 stars is bc the waiter, this young kid, brought us our empty plates and one of them had some food on it, wasn't washed good.  So my wife showed him and asked to bring her a clean one... well, she watched as he carried the plate back and seen him just wipe it with a towel, walked back and gave it back to her.  I was in the restroom washing my hands as this happened. I was gonna say something but my wife is the non- confrontational type,  she told me to just let it go. She just ate off the plate that the noodles was on. Needless to say we didn't leave a tip"}
{"text":"From Orange County, California. Family ordered tapsilogs and longsilogs for breakfast and they were good! Good quality food, good presentation, clean and tidy place, friendly servers. Can't ask for anything more. If you look around with what everyone else is ordering, you'll want to order it too."}
{"text":"I have dined in this location multiple times and their food never disappoints. 

Food: 4.5 out of 5 stars... So far I have tried their lumpia, fishballs, chicken adobo, crispy pata, seafood kare-kare, caldereta, beaf steak, nilagang baka, pancit Malabon, pork barbecue, and chicken barbecue. I would say that their crispy pata, chicken adobo, and barbecue (both chicken and pork) are probably the best ones I've had. These are Filipino food that I rarely crave and usually just grab small pieces when served but after tasting theirs, I now crave for them. I loved their pancit malabon when I ordered it to dine in the restaurant but when I ordered a party tray for new year's eve, there wasn't enough sauce in my tray (still tasted good though). Their seafood kare-kare is also a bomb but I just wish they peeled the shrimp skin before cooking because it's pain to peel them coming out of kare-kare sauce.

Service: 4 out of 5 stars... Their service is way, way better compared to other Filipino places I have visited. Servers are very nice but service can be slow sometimes (hence minus one star). When I came to pick up my party tray orders for new year's eve, I appreciated how the staff has packed them to make sure nothing gets splattered during the drive and they even gave me nice box carriers so I can carry multiple food trays all at ones. I, however, had to wait for more than half an hour after my designated pick-up time before I was able to get all of my orders. 

Place: 4 out of 5 stars... Again, it is way cleaner than a lot of Filipino places I have been to. However, I think the ventilation is not adequate enough because the kitchen smell really gets into the dining area. Their bathroom is also clean but feels like a sauna! They are also located in a relatively safer and way nicer neighborhood as compared to most Filipino places.

Prices: 4.5 out of 5 stars... slightly more expensive than a lot of Filipino places but I completely don't mind due to way better quality of food.

Overall, I will definitely keep coming back despite their location being slightly far from where I live."}
{"text":"T'was my first Filipino restaurant I've been to in the entire US and it did not disappoint. I love the food! Makes me feel like home."}
{"text":"1st time here earlier today. 
they were very short staffed! But like other Filipino restaurants I've been to, that is pretty much the norm so I didn't think much of it
We had to wait for a table to b cleaned off since there were quite a few tables empty but not cleaned - when we got seated table still had crumbs so i just wiped it off
We finally ordered - it takes sometime for the food...1st comes the lechon kawali : very good ; then came the BBQ pork skewer : super dry!!! ; then the tocilog : also very dry and no flavor. Also ordered the fresh lumpia but it NEVER arrived 
No water refills
Fresh melon juice - good
FINALLY after what seemed like forever, we were actually able to flag down one of the waitress and informed her we never received the fresh lumpia and to cancel that order since we were done with our meal and then I started to order halo halo but very oddly the waitress says they have plenty of pending order that she cannot take my order...uhhhhh what?!?!? Seriously?!?!? 
What does a customer say to that??? So I just said ummm I need our check then
***this last part really ticked me off - first of all u r at a food establishment how rude is it to say she can't take our order - if they r so busy, I would have thought she would say ok but it will take longer than usual since they are busy?!?!? But nope the case***"}
{"text":"Highly recommended, food was fresh when they serve cause you can really taste the difference from any other food joint, staff was very accommodating will come back for more."}
{"text":"The food is really good, I really like supporting local businesses those moms and pops store needs our support. It's just sad that when i went there the workers seems not happy working their, for an industry that makes its business through great customer service this place needs A LOT of training on that field. The cashier didn't even thank me for giving them My business. She didn't didn't even engage and just took my money and that's it. This is really sad and I hope that the owner will be able to read this. I want to support ur business but pls train ur staff on customer service. Remember ur not the only Filipino restaurant in the city. Seafood is opening up soon and u might lose not only my business but others as well."}
{"text":"I'm always on the hunt for some Filipino food and decided to give this a try!! It's located where the south outlet malls are, pass the canes and it's right after it. The menu has all the classic Filipino dishes, with prices for the single dishes ranging $9.99-$12.99. Restaurant is very clean and plenty of seating. But... I really hate to give a star off but I know our waitress was annoyed we came at this time.. restaurant closes at 10, we sat down by 8:15. Ive worked In restaurants, and I understand how annoying it is to have people come in late, but it definitely put a damper on the experience because of how short she was, she would came back twice in a span of two minutes asking \"are you ready\" and even when I tried to ask for some suggestions for my friend who was with me who has never tried Filipino food before, she just walked away.  Portion sizes and flavor were pretty good so I'll definitely just order takeout next time??"}
{"text":"If you're looking for good Filipino food, this is the place. Fast service and clean restaurant. Everything tastes great and will definitely satisfy your cravings."}
{"text":"Yay to my 100th review for 2018 and I only think it should go to this new find of mine. It's definitely a new favorite Filipino restaurant for me and I will be back again many more times.

Came across this location while at the South Premium Outlet mall. I had noticed some new businesses and decided to check them out and see if any of them would be something I'd be interested in. I'm so glad I decided to check them out as I found this place as well as a new Black Bear Diner (another great spot). 

I came around 5 pm on a Friday evening for dinner and the place was pretty busy, but not as busy as I had expected. They had plenty of seating available still. We were seated immediately by a friendly waitress. She handed us a couple of menus and brought out some ice water for us. She gave us a few minutes to look over the menu before coming back. I decided to get the Fresh Lumpia, which is a first time for me, but I love veggies so I wanted to give it a try. On top of that, we ordered Pancit Bihon and the Tapsilog dish. 

While we waited I took the time to look around. The main dining area is fairly large and can accommodate quite a few people. They had nice decorations on the wall. It also seemed like they had a wreath for every holiday up on the wall too. A little different, but if it works for them then all the better. Each of the tables had different sauces available on them and were nicely set with a placemat and silverware. Tables were immediately wiped down as soon as customers left and reset with new items on the table. The employees were quick to bring menus and seat people as they entered. The music and TVs weren't overly loud which is nice when you dine with other people and want to have a conversation. Another nice thing I noticed while dining here was the fact that other customers were considerate of their surroundings and made sure not to be too loud for others. 

Our food came out shortly and it looked delicious. My guest is pretty picky when it comes to trying new foods, especially from other countries so I thought what we ordered would be a good choice for him. First off, the Fresh Lumpia wasn't what I expected, but it was still good. It basically is a large lumpia wrapper (fresh and not fried) filled with veggies and topped with a peanut sauce. Overall it was good but probably won't order it again unless someone was with me that really liked it. I ended up eating most of it since my guest didn't care for it. The Fresh Lumpia cost $5.99. The Pancit Bihon was DELICIOUS and it was a large portion as well. Even sharing it I ended up taking half of it home for later. Noodles were well cooked, veggies perfect, and the meat was tender. Everything was seasoned just right. The Pancit cost $8.99. And lastly, the Tapsilog was also a must-try item on their menu. It is made of beef (well seasoned and not overly dried from cooking), garlic rice and egg. You can have the egg however you like but we asked for it to be sunny side up. This cost $7.99. 

They also offer lunch combo specials. Monday thru Friday 11am-4pm. choice of 2 items w/ rice for $8.49. The choices are: Beef Caldereta,            Bistek, Chicken Adobo, Lechon kawali, Dinuguan, Pork Adobo, 1/4 fried daing bangus, Kare-Kare, Menudo, Lechon Paksiw, and1 skewer. 

The menu is large with lots to choose from, so there is something for everyone on it. Even picky eaters can find something even if it's just rice and noodles. I highly recommend coming to this place. 

Last thing before I end this review is that they do have a minium for usuing a card. If you use a debit card, it's $10 or $15 with credit."}
{"text":"Really good food here.  Kinda different from a lot of the Filipino food I have had at other places.  But I liked the flavors and the meat was tender and not overly crispy.  I'll come again for sure!"}
{"text":"This is my second time going to D'Pinoy and this time, my husband and I brought his mom. I love love this restaurant because they have Laing alone. Absolutely my favorite! We also love their Pinapaitan and sisig. These dishes are on point! Tip: Be prepared to wait a little, as you can imagine these dishes are made to Filipino perfection."}
{"text":"Came for the tosilog and halo-halo. Service was short staffed and dishes were served sloppily. The bicol express had sauce all over the edge of the bowl. But it was perhaps the only dish that was good. Tosilog didn't taste much like anything and portion size was small. The palabok was wet and runny and lacked even the simplest of flavor (salt). Halo halo was ok."}
{"text":"This place is our go to Filipino food place.  The service is excellent and the food is delicious.  Prices are worth it. I'd definitely recommend the Kapamilya for a party of 4."}
{"text":"Very clean organized and very friendly customer service I would most definitely come back.. food is amazing as well.. hits the spot when you eat here"}
{"text":"They close at 10:00 PM, so I decided to try this place out & called at 9:37 PM on a Friday night to order 1 dish for take out. The lady told me they were closed (so why are you answering the phone?but ok). I asked what time they closed, she said 10:00 PM but last call is 9:30 PM. This is not a bar where you're calling last call for alcohol.  This is a business, if you don't want to take customers past 9:30 PM, then you should close at 9:30 PM. I'm not even interested in trying them out again based on simple lack of customer service & business fundamentals. A little apology or sincerity in goes a looong way."}
{"text":"Came here today with a party of 30 after a baptism. The staff were all great and the food came out very quickly especially with such a large party. The food was delicious!! I don't have a negative thing to say about my experience here today."}
{"text":"The bbq chicken plate was plenty of food for at least two meals and the lumpia was so good. A coworker brought some food one day and I honestly craved it from that day on."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place by accident and so glad we did. Food was delicious & authentic. Reasonably priced & good sized portions. Service was very friendly & attentive. Lunch specials only $7.99. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Besides A+ on the food,me & my significant enjoyed few dishes(bagoong pork belly,shrimp fried rice, chicharron bulaklak)...this is a great location and a very welcoming place! Thank you..will come again"}
{"text":"2nd time ordering out at flamingo and rainbow ,the oxtail soup is good and the lechon kaweli they put a few good pieces on top and the rest was old and dried so they new what they were doing and thats twice they did that ."}
{"text":"First time eating here. Heard it was good. I was disappointed. Service sucks. The food came one at time and every 20 minutes. I don't recommend this place to amybody"}
{"text":"BS +++

At first glance, this looks like a DJ spot with dancing.  It's nice inside.  Modern tiles and cool tables.  The menu  itself was pretty standard.  We ordered the meal for 5 with fried bangus, pancit, and ukoy.  We also ordered two orders of halo halo and banana Q with buko pandan.  The biggest complain was that the banana inside was not ripe and the sugar was burnt and it taste bitter.  I was highly disappointed.  I didn't want to complain because the owner was super nice.  I want to give this place 5 stars but I wanted to be unbias.  The service here was slow but it was because it was the weekend.  I am guessing they are usually quick.  I would recommend more wait staff.  Also, the restrooms needed some fixings.  I recommend owner to inspect men's bathroom.  I would be sad to hear others complain and give  them a bad name.  Ok now for the food (what I been dying to write) it was AMAZING!  The fried chicken was so good and soft inside.  The pancit was perfect.  The bangus was perfectly made (the fat was perfect).  The sisig was so yummy and not oily.  The atchara was perfect but I wish  they gave more.  The pork was BOMB!!! Holy crap it was soft inside and the crispy skin was great.  The ukoy was my favorite.  It was fluffy and crispy.  The shrimp was so clean and good.  The  desserts was amazing.  The halo halo here kills Fiesta.  I would recommend this place any day.  The prices was good also but I am sure all the locals will find better prices.  I want to come back and  try the other foods.  I came here with my father-in-law (Raffy) who was talking highly about this place since he knows the owner.  My wife and I are from NYC and I can compare this place to one of the best spots there.  I wish I can give them a 5 star but I will give them a BS +++ for the food.  I think however the 18% service charge is a bit much and I think today we got overcharged.  

* Boomsauce scale.
BW = Dis $@% is BASURA! (Garbage).  Not recommended.
BS = it's just O.K. (experience)
BS+ = Yo! I like this place.
BS++= That's Whoa! This place good.
BS+++= Dayumm! This place is fkn DOPE!"}
{"text":"Food always good...always busy when we come in.
Make sure you are NOT in a hurry --and then you will not be disappointed !
Kitchen is slow, but the food is worth the wait !"}
{"text":"Great food and priced really well.  Employees were nice.  Had a party in the banquet space and it was great."}
{"text":"We were visiting from SoCal and was in the mood for Filipino food and found this place. Loved it! It really tasted like home-cooked food. Great portion sizes, not salty, and a very reasonable price. We will definitely be back when in the area. Sorry, no pics because we were too hungry to take pics first. We ordered: calamares, bulalo, mungo, pancit palabok,  and crispy pata. All so good."}
{"text":"Great lunch. Friendly too! Will come here with my friends again.
Great place to eat.
Good Filipino food."}
{"text":"I am so ful! Stopped here for a drive by lunch and I am so happy we did! The food was excellent,  large portions great for sharing and good prices. Too bad they are a 9 hour drive from home!"}
{"text":"Fantastic authentic Filipino food at reasonable prices

$12 lechon

$13 mongo 

$6 halo halo 

The lechon was incredible, crispy skin tender meat 

The mongo was hot and tasty

Unfortunately no room for the halo halo"}
{"text":"Ang Sarap! Found this little gem tucked in the parking lot of the Belz Outlet (LV Blvd. S). Had a hankering for some food from the homeland, but didn't want to make a trip to Seafood City and then have to slave away in the kitchen cooking. 

Got the lunch special-choice of two items with a generous filipino serving of rice. Everything was delish! Service was fast and friendly and the spot is super clean! Will def be back!"}
{"text":"Found this neighborhood foodie that serves great Filipino style foods. The added pleasure of LIVE island music was terrific! The chicken skin appetizer was excellent - very crispy & not greasy at all!"}
{"text":"Visiting my In-laws and decided to try this place out since we were just a few blocks away from our resort.  We wanted to try their Kamayan Fiesta Package since we had about 8 in our group.  Once the food tray came in we were like \"Wow!\".  We were like, \"Ok, ok, let's take a picture before we attack\", because there was soooo much food enough to feed a village.  Of course we couldn't finish it so we took the rest back to the resort.  

So in all, the food was filipino food, tasted like filipino food, looked like filipino food, the resort I was staying at did not have filipino food, so I was hungry for filipino food.  There was absolutely nothing to hate about my experience.  Definitely will be back the next time I stay at the resort in Sin City."}
{"text":"I went during lunch time and it took about 20 minutes to get my order. And then almost another 30 minutes to get my food. 

I ordered tocino and eggs, my tocino was a little cold."}
{"text":"I only give two stars to this place for two things. The place is nice. The second star is for one lady is for being nice (shes probably in her 40s and shes really nice) . She has a shoulder length hair. Always greets the me with a smile. And says \"Salamat\" when I walk out. The other lady that works here whos younger than this lady i guess, is very rude and seem to hate her job at the register taking orders. She said \"thank you\" but doesnt look me in the eye. Very fake service. I was suppose to celebrate my birthday here but i changed my mind. One rude employee really does impact a potential REGULAR customer. Never coming back here ever again. The place looks nice and all but I would rather be at a place where employees are glad that im there paying for their food and trusting their food."}
{"text":"I'm only giving 2 stars because I understand that they are new and probably still have some kinks to work out, otherwise I would only give one star. I am pretty picky about Filipino food (says every Filipino person who loves their own family recipes) but if your food isn't top notch at least make up the difference in your customer service. We came in when it was busy and stood at the front door at least ten minutes without being greeted, waved at or even winked at. Nothing. Then maybe after 15 minutes standing there a lady sat us down. Another 15 minutes goes by and the waitress asks to take our order. No emotion. No expression. Just blank face, silent while writing. (Awkward) so we wait another 10 minutes until my husband has to get up and ask for our waters. I guess I can go on and on but I won't, I think you get my drift. 

The FOOD. I got tapsilog and I have never tasted tapa to be sweet, so I was very disappointed. My moms lechon kawali seemed to have been sitting a while and was cold in the middle with no flavor. The waitress forgot to bring the other drinks we ordered and the side of soup. 

I admire people trying to step out and open a business, but if you're going to do it, do it right. Train your staff on customer service and don't let anything leave your kitchen unless it's fresh. My all time favorite in Las Vegas is Full House BBQ and I attempted to try another place but it can't be beat, so back to Full House I go. 

Work on those things D-Pinoy, and maybe you can have something that is really needed here in Vegas...a really great Filipino restaurant."}
{"text":"After coming here for brunch today, I really wanted to give this place more stars but it was just ok for us. I ordered the tocilog and my boyfriend ordered the longsilog. Both breakfast plates came with your choice of eggs and garlic fried rice. We also ordered crispy chicken skins with a vinegar dipping sauce as an appetizer. The crispy chicken skins were not as crispy as we hoped it would be. It was more chewy than anything. My boyfriend was disappointed that the longanisa was bland with no flavor at all. The worse part of our meal was the garlic fried rice. The rice was so dry and hard that the rice kernels were getting stuck to our teeth. I hate to say this, but it almost seemed like they used their leftover white rice from the day before and made it into garlic fried rice. 

I'm giving this place two stars only for the customer service and the price for the food. The breakfast was $7.99 each. Our waitress was nice and always checked on us. Maybe we came on an off day but we were very disappointed given all these great Yelp reviews on here. Maybe next time, we'll just try their lunch or dinner items on the menu. But for now, we're definitely not stopping in for breakfast."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a high quality Filipino sit-down restaurant for a long time and this place is the BEST!! Ingredients are so fresh and flavorful. Service was quick and friendly. We'll definitely go back again soon to try the rest of the menu. The prices are fair considering everything is made to order. Can't go wrong with the dinuguan or lechon!"}
{"text":"Ordered here for pick up after shopping at the South Outlets on a Sunday evening. Placed my order on the phone. The food was ready within the given time frame of 20 mins. We ordered the beef steak, pansit, and pork sisig. After paying for the order, I realized they added okoy to my dinner order when I looked at the receipt. I brought it up to the cashier, but since it was already paid for I just kept the food. The okoy ended up being one of my favorites! Lol. So crispy and delicious! So was the rest of the food we purchased. The beef steak was not as good compared to Fiesta Filipina even though the prices are similar. However, the prompt service and great food quality will definitely bring us back."}
{"text":"I recently visited Las Vegas and had the opportunity to enjoy Filipino food here at this Filipino restaurant. I recommend their sizzling sisig and their buko pandan for dessert. I really wished they had halayang ube available. They also have lunch specials. It's a nice restaurant where you sit down and order and you can relax. It's located by the outlets but I had a hard time looking for it because it was in the corner and my GPS, but I found it. I am definitely coming back. Hope they get into Uber eats coz I'm too lazy to drive 'yo!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. Such great tasting food with very affordable prices and great portion sizes! It's not like other Filipino restaurants. In my opinion, it's home cooking! Place is very clean and spacious. Staff was very nice and came around often to make sure you're ok. 

My fav dish here is their pork binagoongan with eggplant. So delish! Just the right amount of flavor! Nice and crispy! It keeps you wanting for more. Mmmm...more rice please! 

They also had a lunch special during the weekday from 11-4pm which includes 2 items and rice for $7.99. I love how the special is not dine in only."}
{"text":"The best service. The best Filipino food I have had anywhere including my visit to the Philippines This newly opened 2nd location is as good as the first. I am very impressed with price, the highest assortment and quality of food, they are definitely a 10 plus star. they are far above their competition in quality."}
{"text":"yesterday 9/4/17 decided to come here cause i was craving filipino food and since we were heading to the outlets i decided to give this place a try. ive eaten at the other location but service here was awful and it just made me loose my appetite. came in and was seated and i dont know how busy they were before we came in but alot of people had left and it wasnt even that busy. ordered food and it was a waste of my time. food probobly didnt come out until like an 1 hr later and we ordered the nilaga, lanka & sisig. the food was alright i mean all the filipino resto food here in vegas all taste the same to me. once the food was served not one server was to be found except when they would come out and serve other tables thier food and it was even hard enough to get thier attention cause they werent really concerned about how the other customers were doing once they got their food. since they all deciced to play hide and seek in back  i just decided to get up on my own walk to the cashier and pay my bill after waiting so long for my food and waiting sooooo looooong to get a servers attention they didnt even know what my table was and even asked me \"what table?\" honestly that just pissed me off even more like i dont know what table arrangement you have at your resto you should know????!!!!!!. i do not know what dynamics the staff had that day but the tentions were pretty high and the one girl i noticed was doing most of the work looked pretty pissed and her co-workes looked like they did not give a damn. tables were left un cleaned until she came out and cleaned it and the rest of the staff just left her to clean it all up. im sorry to say but having 2 tables of a party of more than 5 and about 4 tables with about 3-4 people with what it seemed like to me was 4 servers on the floor dose not look short staffed to me. i could understand if there was one chef cooking all the food that day but at least know how to attend to your customers before, during and after they get their food. who ever is manageing this location needs to teach his staff customer service because this place could have potential. im pretty understanding to those servers whom are busy and have alot to attend to at the same time and im a very patient person, but with my experince today these people did not have an excuse to be so unattentive to thier customers and not to be mean but it didnt seem like they were busy or doing anything in the back either. very disappointed and i dont think ill be coming back. ill just stick to fiesta filipino, point to what i want and go!"}
{"text":"...interesting!

not what i expected from a filipino restaurant 

equipped with pinoys and the sound of slow jams playing surround sound ...very pinoy!

its located out AWAY from the strip tho...bout 20 min uber.

the food here is pretty good tho.  very 'hit the spot' type cookin' thats great for the evening dinner with the family."}
{"text":"Everything was amazing, it's awesome to experience cuisine that we do not typically have a chance to enjoy (and have our children experience). I'd eat here again for sure and did snag a few extra lumpia for the ride home!"}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant out and ordered the Kare-Kare, Pork Sinigang and the Pampano Fish with tomatoes and onions.  The fish and the Kare-Kare tasted good.  The meat in the Sinigang could have been cooked more so that it is more tender and the soup was a little too sour for our taste.  Overall, we would come back here to try the other dishes.  I like that the restaurant serves the food on the table rather than turo-turo like other Filipino restaurants do."}
{"text":"I've been to 100s of Filipino restaurants but this has to be one of the best. Awesome service!! Friendly staff!! Clean restaurant!! Tasty food!! What more can you ask for?!?"}
{"text":"Servings are kinda small but the food is really good, the servers are all friendly esp. the owner she is so kind and she treat us really well. I will definitely recommend this place to my family and friends."}
{"text":"Finally another location closer to the south side of Las Vegas... This Filipino restaurant has been on the top of my list to go get Filipino food. Great staff and this new location is a lot cleaner than the other. Food is always great! The chicken adobo and beef sinigang with garlic rice is all I need. Will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"One of the best dining experiences of my week plus vacation!

They served food like they wanted to and enjoyed serving you. You have a ton of choices in Las Vegas, I am glad my family and I chose this place.

We had the bangus (milkfish) sisig, pork sinagang, pork sisig, Kare Kare and so much more --- if you have never tried Filipino food, it is going to be the next big food rush (trust me on this) --- do your self a favor visit this place and experiment.

Great customer service, very clean establishment. I cannot say enough positive about this place. Just thoroughly enjoyed the dining experience. Do not expect fancy, but do expect good service, good food, in a clean restaurant - great experience!"}
{"text":"Get the okoy!!  Restaurant is immaculately clean. Service is friendly and prompt. There's a fry master in the kitchen for sure. Menu selection is vast. This beats cooking for myself :)"}
{"text":"I think the food is great here I was very disappointed with the service.  It was busy and the food came out in a reasonable amount of time but there was no follow up and I had to go ask for more rice at the register.  I had the beef steak lichon and the halo halo.  Jade was my server.  They have to bus their own tables so it takes away from the service experience."}
{"text":"The middle one of three restaurants! All three are good. Everything they serve here is delicious and the service is quick and friendly.  I love the chicken curry - not an item typically found in a Filipino restaurant. My spouse eats everything from the Dinuguan to the Arroxcaldo.  Give it a try.  The Salvadoran restaurant next door is also good as is the Diner on the other side."}
{"text":"Great service- the titas there were so sweet and helped my friend that's never had filipino food with awesome choices.

Food portions were huge and fresh! We barely made a dent on our dishes. Everything was as good as my mommas cooking and that says a lot! 

We came a little after lunch time so it wasn't completely busy, but the decor and cleanliness was intact. 

Definitely recommend this place and would take friends/fam here on my next visit!"}
