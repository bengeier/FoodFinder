{"text":"Overpriced and underwhelming. Have lived nearby for 4 years and thought we would finally go...what a mistake! Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I have never been so insulted by a restaurant...  Took my 11-year old son to the \"Voltaire\" to have his first Filet Mignon, since steak is his favorite food. Thought we would do it right by going to an upscale French restaurant and we got all dressed up.   Put in an order for a Ceaser Salad and the Filet Mignon entree and planned to share it with my son. Bad idea. When the salad comes out, the head host guy comes over and says that we are required to each order an entree and that he doesn't want to serve us if we are going to share. Says he doesn't like people coming to his restaurant for a cheap meal. What the heck?!...a salad and Filet Mignon is $39. So he had a standoff about it with me in the middle of the restaurant at my table and my son says to me afterward that he was shaking scared because of how rude this guy was. A real-life Scrooge.  We left the restaurant quite offended. The salad looked pretty sparse anyway. Probably didn't miss anything.   Took my kid to Johnny Rockets instead and got 10 times better service from a high school kid."}
{"text":"We had a very good dinner last night; we took advantage of the 3-course meal for $28. There were enough selections for each course and the food was delicious. Our Caesar salad and Blue Cheese salad were very good. The sandabs I had for an entree were cooked perfectly and my husband's chicken in puff pastry was quite large with very good chicken, spinach, and sauce. I had the profiteroles for dessert- fabulous dark chocolate sauce, but the puffs were a little chewy. My husband's creme brûlée was rich and creamy. Service by Erica was exactly right: attentive, informative, polite, and a good sense of humor. Contrary to previous reviews, the gentleman at the door was very polite; he also came to our table a couple of times to ask if all was well. The restaurant was busy and everyone seemed to be enjoying their food and the atmosphere. I understand they will be changing the menu and decor while they close for the summer....I look forward to seeing the changes, but hope to return a few more times before the summer closure."}

{"text":"We went to Voltaire for my birthday 2 weeks ago with friends. We had 2 for 1 coupons- there were 5 of us... The place was on the small side compared to many restaurants, but cozy. We were given a table in the middle of the room. I did notice like others have said that the wallpaper was very dated, probably from the 70's. My hubby and I both had a glass of wine, priced to the high side. I had a dinner salad that was nice, on the small side, but enough for me, mixed greens, tomato, vinaigrette. He got the French onion soup which had a thick layer of cheese and he said was very good! We were served small, warm french rolls with cold butter pats with this. For entrees I got a Filet Mignon, it was supposed to be Medium Rare but was Medium verging onto Medium Well- I was not a happy camper. If it had been just the 2 of us I would have sent it back- especially at those prices, but I ate it. It came with broccoli rabe which was cooked nicely. My hubby had the duck. I was VERY surprised to see that they used a thigh instead of a breast. The waitress told us that was because it was juicier, it is also cheaper! He has had breast every other place he has had it and when cooked right- like at Adrienne's in New Milford, CT- it is wonderful, crispy skin, succulent meat. So...not impressed! For dessert I got creme brulee, it was creamy but had no flavor. So, it was ok, but could have been much better. With this, tax and the tip they added (which they do for parties of 6, but we were 5!!!) we were at $58.00 per head, after the coupon. Compare this dinner to the one at Diamond Point Shadows."}
{"text":"Top notch restaurant. My wife is a chef and we love finding great places to eat. The service here is impeccable and the food is delicious. The interior looks a bit dated and most of the customers are elderly, but those are stupid reasons to knock the restaurant. Our waitress Helen was extremely attentive and kind, adding a nice French touch to the evening. She even sang happy birthday to a customer with an angelic voice. I've been here twice and both times were excellent. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place out recently with a groupon, and we hated everything: the food, the service and the place. First, the place smells like old fish. The decoration is horrible, and you feel you are visiting your 90-year old aunt who hasn't taken care of her place since she was 50. The Maitre D' has real issues. He was on top of the poor waitress and micromanages the place to the point of making the guests uncomfortable. Second, the food is nothing special. We had the lamb, which came with potato puree and green beens swimming in butter. The lamb was just OK, but nothing compared with dozens of other places around the valley. The list of wines by the glass was limited and disappointing, and the creme brulee was nothing out of the ordinary. Third, they forgot to use the groupon when they brought the check, and when we reminded them the check came back with the tip included (18%). We thought this was incredibly rude. I understand that some people do not tip for the entire amount when using groupons, but I don't think it is OK to include a 18% tip for a table of two without the customer's permission."}
{"text":"I just my first opportunity to have dinner there with another guest.  When first walking into the main dining room, you immediately see an outdated, windowless, low-ceiling environment that appeared and felt very stuffy.  I had a 6:30 reservation but showed up about 15 minutes early.  The maitre'd sat us in a table right next to the entrance of the dining room.  I asked if we could have a table away from the entrance since the room was not even 50% full.  He amazingly said that all the tables were not available.  The dining room never filled up for the 60 minutes that we were seated.  Strike one.  We perused the menu and saw that there were only 2 fish entrees and no vegetarian entrees.  Strike two.  My guest ordered the filet mignon, medium rare, and I ordered the sandab entree.  We also ordered the shrimp cocktail appetizer.  The shrimp cocktail appetizer was priced at $12.50 and we received 4 small/medium shrimp.  Strike three.    Before the main dishes came, we were offered bread for our table.  1 piece each!  We weren't even offered the bread basket.  And the rolls tasted like they came from Safeway.  My guest's filet mignon entreee was very small in size and not cooked to order.  The side dishes that came with the entree had too much garlic and oil.  My entree was sadly much worse.  The fish portions, 4 small and thin fried pieces, were not only small but tasted as if they fried the portions from the frozen food section.  6 green grapes garnished the top of the fish.  At $25 for this entree, this entree made my top 5 overpriced entrees of all time.  I've had better fish meals at Long John Silver's.  We decided to skip the dessert after our main food experience.    If you are looking for an overpriced restaurant with mediocre food quality and portions and an ambience that could be mistaken for a 1950s rest home, you have come to the right place.  Otherwise, you are much better off at newer restaurants in Scottsdale/Phoenix that offer a more vibrant atmosphere, higher quality food and generous portions, and friendly environment."}
{"text":"Had a special here the other night...Elk tenderloin with Huckleberry sauce, side of mashed potatos and the most wonderful sugar-snap peas you can imagine. The fresh bread they bring first alone makes me want to come back. I hear elk can be very gamey, and I don't know if it's just how Chef David prepared it, but it was unforgettably good (he recommends somewhere between rare and med-rare, which was perfect). Like I said, it was a special, it's worth calling them ahead to find out what's going on. If Elk is there, just stop thinking and get in your car. Husband had the duck. Cripsy skin, tender and juicy inside, with perfect Orange sauce. He almost cried. I watched others order the Dover Sole, and it is really cool to watch the waiters come out with the cart and portable stove, bone the fish and warm it in the butter sauce right in front of you! I overheard them telling another table they are flown in from Holland every Monday. I think the Dover Sole is a Monday specialty, in fact. Yes, the decor looks original 1983, but hey...pretend you have a French grandma and you're having a formal dinner at her house. There. Now relax and enjoy a fine meal!"}
{"text":"In the Phoenix area, my husband and I have  been to other french restaurants such as Sophies, and Coup Des Tartes.  Voltaire's is by far our favorite.  The service is impeccable and the food is delicious.  This restaurant food reminded me of my honeymoon in France. The restuarant has been open for years and years. That should speak volumes, as there are so many restaurants that don't make it and close.  You can also go to restaurant.com and get purchase a  discount coupon for eating here or you can go to the restaurants web site and get a buy one dinner get one free.  Worth trying out."}
{"text":"Not impressed, terrible experience.   Maitre D' was rude when we arrived  They don't take AMEX, the Maitre D' dropped the card on the table said \"we don't take American Express\"  and walked away.  When we were leaving he didn't thank us for coming, instead he chased us out the door to question our tip even though it was close to 25%  The food was unimpressive.  Service was quick and friendly  Building is cool but the atmosphere stinks.   Don't wast your cash, Folks.  If you want good French food go to Vincent's on Camelback or Zinc Bistro in Kierland."}
{"text":"Yes, this place is old school Scottsdale and no, the clientele is not the young and the hip. Big deal. If that makes you feel out of place, then by all means, visit someplace where you can see and be seen. This is a nice little low-slung building, with an interior that says \"My French grandmother decorated twenty years ago,\" but it works. It's comfortable. I bought a Groupon to Voltaire a while back and only afterward did I read the reviews on Yelp. I had buyer's remorse. I felt anxious about visiting. Was I going to be the youngest in the dining room? Was the food going to be bland? Is the smell of Ben Gay going to ruin the wine? Was the Maître d' going to be rude? The answers are no, no, no, and kind of.  Let me address the food, since that's the whole point of a restaurant. It was great. My wife and I both started with the onion soup. It was excellent. Not as much umami as you find in the onion soup and Zinc Bistro, but you know what? Zinc Bistro cheats and puts soy sauce in their onion soup. This was excellent old school onion soup. For entrees, I had the sweetbreads and my wife had the Filet Mignon with peppercorn sauce. I'd never had sweetbreads, so I asked our waitress what she thought of them, and she was truthful, saying they were an acquired taste. Well, it's safe to say that I've acquired a taste for calf thymus. This was accompanied by corn, snap peas, and a dab of very creamy garlic mashed potatoes, all of which were very nice. The vegetables were served modestly, with salt and butter and it works. My wife's Filet was good. I'm not a huge fan steak au poivre, but it was good. I enjoyed my steak a bit more at Cafe Roka recently, but they're served with two completely different sauces. For desert, my wife tried the creme brulee and reports that it was nice and light, and I had the ice cream with candied chestnuts.  This was super-sweet. The flavor of the chestnuts was lost amongst the caramel sauce. I can't believe I ate the whole thing.  Regarding the age of the clientele, there was actually one couple present who were younger than us, but for the most part the crowd was made up of Boomers. There was only one bona fide blue hair and I happened to notice our waitress lending an arm to assist this lady up from her table and out the front door -very thoughtful. Dress code seems to be fairly casual (much to the Maître d's chagrin, I suspect). I thought I was going casual with chinos and an oxford, but there was a dude there with jeans and Birks.  Finally, the Maître d'... This guy... what can I say about him. He gave us a look up and down when we came in.  Well, my wife got the look anyway - I think I looked pretty good in my chinos and French blue oxford.  I wonder if the Boomer in jeans and Birks got the look, too?  The Maître d' was pleasant enough when we had to interact with him (he seats guests and apparently runs credit cards), but I just got this vibe from him that we were not living up to his expectations as guests. Then the funniest thing happened (well, I'd had a couple of glasses of happiness, so it was funny at the time): when we got our credit card receipt back, he'd written in the tip for us!!!  It was as if he couldn't trust us to (a) leave a tip or (b) leave a tip on the full amount of the bill, not just the part remaining after the Groupon came off the top.  I wouldn't let this guy spoil your evening - unless he chases you into the parking lot as per one previous review.  Even then you'll have something to tell your grandchildren. The food is great here. The ambiance is cozy.  The crowd might be a little geriatric, but you know what, so is your grandmother.  Just enjoy your time, and see if the Maître d' does anything funny and report it here."}
{"text":"First of all, if you like classic French food, this place is for you. Prices are very reasonable and dishes are well-executed. If you're in your 20s-30s, it's not a place to impress your date or friends - it's not trendy or slick. Actually, to be honest, I don't really like this typical for many authentic French restaurants home style decor - it's too old fashioned for me and depressing...   It was a Thanksgiving evening and  besides being Europeans (= New year is a bigger holiday for us than Christmas), we don't have any relatives in this area to celebrate this holiday with, so we called all restaurants which were opened on Thanksgiving and Voltaire was one of them. Party of 3 - last minute reservation - no problem.  We liked food  a lot and if we were in our late 50s-60s-70s, we would go to this restaurant on a regular basis, but we're still too young to enjoy being there - the atmosphere in this restaurant kills my spirit and mood.    I was surprised to see a female waitress as French restaurants are known for hiring only male waiters, but we were there on a big holiday, so it wasn't a typical day and possibly their regular personnel didn't want to work.  Would I go back? Probably, but not in the nearest future. Would I recommend this place? Yes, you have to experience it yourself if you like authentic French cuisine ."}
{"text":"This place is just ok - the smell once you walk in the door is not pleasing...very musty smelling.  The decor is extremely dated.  However, the food was pretty good and the service was average.  Not the best French place in town, by any stretch of the imagination!  Beware...does not take American Express either - how strange for an expensive restaurant!"}
{"text":"Service was good and attentive, but the food was decidedly average.  My soup (vichyssoise) was very good, the proper temperature and very well blended; my wife's French Onion was \"ok.\"   For entrees, my Orange Duck was good, but nothing special, with uncrisped skin. My wife's garlic steak was ok, but the meat itself was bland although the garlic sauce was nice. The included sides (a tiny dallop of acceptable mashed potatoes, a few snow peas, and very tasty butternut squash cubes) was far better than the extra side we shared: fingerling potatoes with truffel oil, which had an odd \"mustardy\" flavor I really disliked.   Desert was the largest disappointment - my Peach Melba (admittedly ordered in December) was canned peaches (tasted exactly like Dole!) and off-the-shelf vanilla icecream and raspberry sauce. My wife's profiterroles (cream puffs) were just as ordinary - the chocolate sauce was Hershey's according to my chocolate-addicted wife, with the same ordinary ice cream and \"nothing special\" creampuffs.  The decor is typical retired Scottsdale 1970s: flowery wallpaper, cheap crystal chandeliers, \"classic\" black-and-white waiter attire. At 40, I think I was the youngest person there.   For the price, Vincent's on Camelback is light years better.  For the decor, almost any place is better."}
{"text":"My Husband and I went to Voltaire last night for my bday, we enjoyed the atmosphere (French decor) and the jazz music playing in the background, we found it to be nice & romantic. We ordered the french onion soup as an appetizer, and both of us thought that it was good. We than ordered the orange duck & the peppercorn steak., both items were good, not great. Although we enjoyed it, we thought before we come back we'd want to try out other restaurants."}
{"text":"Tried this place with a restaurant.com offer & still thought it was overpriced and extremely subpar food."}
{"text":"What's with the Maitre D'?  We leave a tip exceeding 20% and he chases out after us after dinner, catches up with us outside and challenges us about the tip!  (The service was okay, but it took about 7 minutes before anyone took our drink order or brought menus).  He (the Maitre D') then accuses us of having a \"coupon mentality\" (I guess because we came in with a coupon on a night when it wasn't honored).  What's wrong with a $60 tip on a $280 bill?  Apparently this guy thinks that just because this is some fancy French restaurant we should be tipping way more.  This guy is incredible!  The overpriced food isn't good enough for him to be this eccentric.  He ruined our night, and obviously we will not be going back!"}
{"text":"I've read about the service and food at French restaurants in the past where waiters would bone a fish, mix a salad and prepare Crepes Suzette all done table side. Well I'm happy to share that Voltaire serves little piece of that history in a sleepy neighborhood of Scottsdale away from the hustle and bustle of Old Town.  Opened in 1983, Voltaire has an understated charm that's both enduring and endearing. The flowered wallpaper and wainscoting immediately took me back to a time when Madonna looked like a woman rather than a carved turkey. Owned and operated by the Antonelli family, son Chef David expertly heads the kitchen while his father Martin runs the front of the house. The duo provide top notch service and outstanding French fare.  Nothing says loving like a gorgeous plate of Rabbit Pate ($13). Served with classic accompaniments, this special includes toast, gherkin pickles and rustic French mustard, simply divine.  I feel blessed with some excellent bowls of French onion soup from around the valley, Chef David's doesn't disappoint. His version, Soupe a l'Oignon Parisienne ($7.50), is as homey and comforting as a hug from mom. Well that's if moms hugs were made from veal stock, caramelized onions and gooey melted gruyere cheese.  When the service cart is wheeled to your table, you know you're in for a treat. The Spinach Salad ($6.95) is started with your server pan cooking bacon then adding a splash of red wine vinegar. In a sizzle and a pop the bacon vinaigrette is finished then tossed with spinach leaves and button mushrooms. We asked for Chef David to poach and egg to top off the warm salad, the creamy yolk added another component to the already stellar salad.   If you have a hard time selecting an entree, I would highly recommend Le Poulet en Croûte ($24). Puff pastry wrapped around creamed spinach and a fork tender chicken breast was a satisfying choice. Or the meaty Le Steak au Poivre Sauté Richelieu ($30), a New York strip blanketed with a cracked black peppercorn finish, was so tender and well prepared Id be hard pressed to order anything else.   Draped with a shimmering gloss of truffled cream sauce, the Coquilles St. Jaxques ($31) was another solid suggestion. You just can't go wrong with buttery pan seared scallops of this caliber.  When our server flambéd the Cherries Jubilee ($14) table side with Grand Marnier and cherry brandy, she began to sing La Vie En Rose. Her beautiful voice filled the dining room as she lovingly prepared our dessert. When she started to spoon the warmed cherries over a mound of vanilla ice cream, I turned and looked deeply into my partners eyes and couldn't help think how this intimate moment will be remembered, always."}
{"text":"I was deceived by their advertisement of \"The best restaurant of Pheonix 2010\". Bad foods and terrible, arrogant management! I will never go back.  I totally forgot that I bought groupon that it is almost expiring. It is too late to ask friends to go together that I went the restaurant alone. I used to be a food critic that I know what is a good taste is.  The wall paper is so old and smells so bad like a rotten fish. I ordered a onion soup and a rib eye steak. The onion soup smells weird and salty. Though disappointed but expected rib eye because they said it is special of the day. Steak was so dry and juiceless and sauce was too sour that meat and sauce was conflicting.  When I show the groupon and AMEX, the owner told me I can not use the groupon because I came alone. Also he told me so arrogantly that we do not accept AMEX. He told me to come back again with the coupon but it is expiring that there is no way I can use it.  Therefore I ask him just use the half the value of the coupon and he accepted. When he return, he gave me the check with tip already 18% applied. I thought it is my right to decide the tip but he argue that as I use the promotion, 18% is automatic.  I did not use promotion at all. Though I wanted to use groupon, I could not. I paid in full but he argued that it is a promotion. He told me \"I don't know what kind of food critic you are, you don't know the taste. The cook is world best class!\". I don't think so.  He yelled at me that \"if you do not give 18% of tip, you are depriving of the poor waitress's money\". So I told, \"I was about to give 18% but because of you I decided not to. You are the reason I don't want to offer a tip. You are depriving of the money from her!\" Then I gave around 9% of tip. Though I did not want to give any tip, but the waitress was kind, at least.  Bad foods, terrible management, stinky environment. I will never go back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant gets good reviews, but it left me feeling sort of blah. We even had a coupon for the place and dinner for two - with no alcohol! - was still over $85.00. The steak was okay. But the veal was chewy and over cooked. The mashed potatoes were very good, but the cowboy fries in truffle oil tasted bland.  The escargot was not good at all. Too little garlic and no puff pastry. There are better French restaurants out there."}
{"text":"This used to be one of our favorite restaurants - after tonight , not so much.  In the past they had a complimentary salad w/ beets which was excellent. Tonight the special salad , which was similar was an astounding $14.  I don't know of any other restaurant in the Phoenix area that would charge $14 for lettuce, a few beets and goat cheese.  Also it took an act of congress to get the dressing I wanted. On to the entrees, My chicken in pastry had maybe three ounces of chicken in it and my wife's sand dabs was about one half the portion it used to be.  It was made up w/ extra grapes?  The servers were efficient, but faintly reminiscent of step ford wives.  Many reviews have mentioned the owner, we learned a long time ago to avoid him and you can possibly have a pleasant evening.  Go at your own risk!  To top off the evening Was a sign posted in the men's room. \"Pee in the urinal and not on the floor\".  Very classy!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I'm a foodie with a very large expense account to entertain clients so I love to try fun, new, and most importantly, delicious places.  So when I saw a groupon for Voltaire pop up and noticed that it was right down the street from me and I had never heard of it, I thought that was a fabulous excuse to try, right?!  ...BIG MISTAKE!!    Attempt 1: We arrive at 8:30pm (closing time is listed as 9:30 on the website) and we are not allowed to be seated.  In the rudest manner possible we were told that the website did not say closing was 9:30 (which it does) and if it did, why would we expect to be seated an hour before close? ...since the doors close at 9:30 and they stop serving at 7:30.  I've never heard of this and I eat out every night for work or personal and I've never been refused service if I come in a reasonable time before close at any reputable restaurant. If the kitchen is close, I'm usually informed in a very apologetic manner...not the case here.     Attempt 2: We make a reservation for a few nights later.  On the way there to meet my date (we're both doctors) she got called back to the ER.  So I simply went in on my own as I hated to cancel 10 minutes before, explained myself and said I'd be more than happy to purchase two meals to make up for her absence.  Again, I was rudely denied service.  However, after checking the fine print,  the groupon did say that two diners must be present.  So my bad there...but still, must one be so rude?  I'm was certainly not looking forward to going back after two rude bouts.  I was amazed they even made me another reservation!  Attempt 3:  Success!!! We're seated very quickly, early in fact.  And, I'm doing my best to be unbiased as I'm disgusted with this place and sworn to never go back.  But hey, everyone has bad days and I won't let a rude owner ruin what might be a great new culinary find for me. Well, spoiler alert, I won't be going back.    Not that the food was bad, it wasn't.  It was simply average.  Considering the decor is straight from grandma's living room (appropriate considering the 60+ clientele) and the food was on the price side, I can't give this place a good review.  It simply doesn't compare with similarly priced places in the area in food quality or ambiance.  Add in the owner's attitude, and I won't return.  Granted, the service was great as my waitress was both very helpful and knowledgeable. So no complaints on the wait staff or service."}
