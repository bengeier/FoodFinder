{"text":"we have ordered from here for almost 9 years. The previus owner was outstanding. Since the new people took over the service and quality have gone from a 10 to a 1.  I pay for extra toppings and end up gettin barely any toppings at all. takes a good 90 minutes for 1 pizza to come, and when it comes its cold.  Called to complain a few times and the guy working argues with me!!!  Like I said, we've ordered from here for almost 9 years as my husband loves the wings. Wont be calling anymore!"}
{"text":"Don't let the location fool you, Very good pizza. We got a small 10\" for my very picky daughter and she loved it... Ate 3 pieces (that's a lot for her). Friendly staff, will be coming back."}
{"text":"I don't care.  This place is cheap and delicious.   I think it's one of those hidden mom and pop pizza places that knock the socks off of stupid chain pizza places.   If you ever find yourself in the NE stop there and just buy a whole pie.     Very cute couple running it.     They get more delivery orders than walk-ins in assuming.   Some days they are not able to deliver because they are so little but I live close enough to pick up."}
