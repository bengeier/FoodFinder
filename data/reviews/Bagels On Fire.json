{"text":"Cute spot in the Beaches!   My boyfriend and I were feeling like bagels on a Sunday morning and this hit the spot. Bagels are a little small in size, but still delicious. I had a BLT on a toasted poppy seed bagel. I'd go back!"}
{"text":"I've been searching for good ole Montreal style bagels since I've left Montreal 10 Years ago.  I used to schlep out to at Lawrence market to get them - and was so happy when Bagels on Fire opened up in the hood (the beaches). Their bagels are amazing - chewy, dense and sweet, just like they are supposed to be. I've tried some of their baked goods - the spinach knish is awesome.  Bagels have always been fresh when I've bought them - unlike one place I went to uptown where I think they sold me yesterday's bagels. Gross.  The owners are super nice and they have a great \"made in Canada\" story about saving money to open their store etc.  I'm not a big fan of their cream cheese - too light for my liking but everyone has their own taste."}
{"text":"The only thing I missed moving from avenue and Lawrence was bagels! When we moved to the beach it had everything except great bagels. Turns out shortly after we moved in the best bagel place in the city opened up. I have my fingers crossed for a Ramen noodle and Portuguese chicken place. Then I'll be set! I recommend the coconut bagel."}
{"text":"Called to ask about ingredients, hoping to buy a bunch of bagels for a family event. The person who picked up didn't know what was in them and didn't care, and then hung up on me. So that's disappointing."}
{"text":"I know, I know. Nothing compares to Montreal, but we're in Toronto. These are by far the best Montreal style I've had in the city. Great staff, kid friendly and a zillion times better than what I've had in St Lawrence Market. Now a regular - and the poppy seed bagel is a favourite."}
{"text":"I am not sure what else I can add to all these glowing reviews of Bagels on Fire. You want good bagels, you get them here! I tried the pumpernickel and the coconut one, both with cream cheese. Somewhat exotic selection with the coconut, but it didn't stray away from what a good bagel is, in terms of the chewy doughy texture, but added hint of flavour from the crisp brown baked coconut grates. FRESHLY MADE is what you can taste amply. This is the local go-to bagel stop!"}
{"text":"I've never had bagels as good as these in Ontario. Crispy on the outside, chewing inside. The coffee is from Kicking Horse and it is a steal.  I tried a coconut bagel today, hot out of the oven. It is wonderful just a bit sweet. Never had a bagel like this before. You have to try it."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out as we had seen great reviews and had a number of overnight guests for a Saturday evening Easter dinner( which was fabulous by the way :) ).  Called the day before to check they would be open on Easter Sunday  Check.  Two thumbs up.  Opened early.  Check Two thumbs up. Arrived at the store, small, cozy, warm and a wonderful aroma in the air, check Two thumbs up.   Great choice of styles/flavours. Check two thumbs up.  Decided on 18 assorted.  14 bucks. Bingo! We have a winner.  Took them home still warm.  Guests all loved them and still have some left over for Easter Monday.  Great.  If you enjoy a bagel these are as good as anything in Montreal so save yourself the drive"}
{"text":"Meh...not as good as Montreal! Decent bagel but not out of this world...we had the typical poppy seed and sesame seed bagels and tried a coconut bagel, which was more like a dessert than a bagel.   The salesperson was very helpful and nice!"}
{"text":"Best bagels in Toronto, IMO.  All flavours are yummy, but the coconut - suprisingly - is beyond delicious. I love the look on friend's faces when they try for the first time.  Haven't tried the sandwiches, but their bagels and pretzels are outstanding."}
{"text":"I come down to the area just for these bagels.  Nice family business with a few tables.  I get a half dozen to go.  Today was able to get right out of the oven, so good."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Go there every weekend to get bagels for the week and some challah bread. Bagels are very very good, extremely comparable to bagels we get from Montreal. Service is amazing, everyone is so nice and the food is delicious"}
{"text":"Fantastic Montreal style bagels. They do sandwiches and cream cheese at the prep counter and serve Kicking Horse coffee."}
{"text":"I swear my work keeps this place in business...however for good reason! The bagels here are delicious, light and fluffy, made every morning by the owners. If you want to verify stop by around 6 am and you can see them making them for the day. They have a very large selection to please just about any person. They also offer great bagel sandwiches which offer me and my co workers a quick but yummy lunch! They also have amazing cream cheese selections - chive, dill, garden veg, kalamata olive, strawberry!!"}
{"text":"I'm not one for bagels but damn these things are good. What really got me was the smoked salmon, capers and onion bagel. So many pungent yet satisfying flavours between two slices.   You'll never find a girlfriend after eating one, but who needs to when you're getting your kicks from your new found eating disorder."}
{"text":"Finally a real bagel shop in Toronto! This is on par with authentic Montreal bagel place. Baked on the spot. Always so fresh. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Best bagels in the city - as an ex-Montrealler I can attest to the authentic nature of these bagels."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrific bagels, though get here early in the morning if you're planning on getting a bunch for the week! Also, while you're here, do yourself a favour and get one of the pretzels (if they're still available) - they're the perfect mix of salty with crunchy exteriors and soft interiors."}
{"text":"I finally found out about this place.  Thanks Yelp! Great bagels and other bakery goods. Real wood burning oven."}
{"text":"Living in the beach, we pick up bagels here often! By far the best in the beach and they make a fantastic, chewy bagel! I love the coconut and everything bagels best. My only (minor) complaint would be that sandwich bagels can get a bit pricy.. but sometimes it's just convenient!"}
{"text":"Yummy bagels.  Bought a dozen.  Discovered a very long black hair baked in the last one.  Of course.  So disgusting.   Sorry, I can't ever go back.   There are too many other places to get Montreal style bagels.    Are hair nets no longer mandatory in the food prep business?   I don't think so.  Nor is hand washing.    But that will be in another review....  So so gross."}
{"text":"Yum!!! Quick and reasonably priced delicious bagel sandwiches. I'm from out of town and just wanted a breakfast bagel. Only thing I would say is bagels are on the small side."}
{"text":"Great little family run, wood oven baked bagel shop. They learned their trade at the Bagel House, so you may recognise some items, like the giant pretzels and hamentaschen.  They serve (and sell) Kicking Horse coffee.   Nice addition to the east end of the Beach."}
{"text":"Great bagels even when it's room temperature. Chewy and fresh. Love their sesame and everything bagels. I used to order salmon lox and roast beef sandwich, they were just amazing. Friendly service."}
{"text":"The breakfast sandwich with bacon...amazing! I wish I could have one every day!!! Staff are also super friendly and always remember my order!"}
{"text":"Yummy bagels. Fresh out of the oven. Nice, hard working, owner operated place in the beach. Great sandwiches"}
{"text":"Take it from a Montrealer - this is the closest thing to a Montreal style bagel in the East end. Make the trip to the Bagel House if you want a better approximation but if you live in the Beach and you don't want to schlep to the Bayview/Eglinton area, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Best place to get bagels in the beach and the east end of the city (as far as I know).  Baked in a wood fire oven right in the store......unlike some shops that just have them delivered by a commercial bakery.    Owners are the nicest people.....and don't be surprised if you open your bag when you get home and they've thrown in a new flavour they're trying out or an extra bagel or two....just because.  They bake every day....all day so you know what you're getting is fresh and it's not unusual for your purchase to be fresh out of the oven.  Looking for a good inexpensive lunch?  This is the place.  5 buck roast beef and swiss on a fresh bagels with lettuce and tomato is 5 bucks and it's plenty.  All sandwich ingredients are fresh...I've never had a bad sandwich from here.  I do have a sandwich bagel shop less than a one minute walk from home but this place is so worth the two block walk that  I just don't go there.  There is some seating, maybe 4 or 5 small tables but most people just come for take-out.  Busiest times are mornings, lunch hour and Sunday until mid-afternoon.  The line-up might be long but they staff for the Sunday rush.....and don't worry if your favourite flavour is out, they'll tell you how many minutes you'll have to wait for a fresh batch straight out of the oven.  Prices are so reasonable....considering the quality and the freshness.  And if you don't mind day-olds.....they also have them on the counter batched in 1/2 dozen bags (not that you'd notice they're day-olds....but what a bargain).  I'm loathe to give away our neighbourhood gem but they are so deserving of the recognition.    Try it.....you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love coming here on Sunday mornings. These guy's are popping out the Freshest tastiest bagels in TO! We're lucky to have them in \"The Beach\". Take it from one who knows an ex New Yorker always on the hunt for good things that remind me of home.  Now to find some good Brooklyn Pizza!  Oh if I could have one wish, would love it if you tried making some Bialy's!"}
{"text":"Love these bagels! Especially the extra-large Twister. Inside is take away only - they have an awesome wood-fire oven cooking the bagels and the aroma of that fills the place very pleasantly."}
{"text":"Really good bagels. Tried Salmon lox and cheese,  roast beef and montreal smoked meat sandwiches.  They all are consistently delicous. Close to my work.  Salmon lox and cheese and coconut bagel was my favourite.  Great for quick grabs for lunch or breakfast."}
{"text":"I ordered the Montreal Bagel Sandwich (I forgot the name of the order, so I hope you guys know what I'm talking about) along with a medium black coffee. This really hit the spot! It was very good in my opinion. I never tried Montreal bagels before, but I thought the taste was very exquisite. The coffee had a strong taste to it, just the way I like my coffee.  I would highly recommend this place. AND it is located in such a cute area, which is a more reason to check out this place!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this spot more stars, but had a pretty disappointing experience here last weekend. I was excited to learn there was a 'montreal-style' bagel place in the beaches, and heard the story about the couple who started it. I think it's a great idea and definitely good for the beaches to have a place like this! Unfortunately the bagels we  had on Saturday morning did not meet expectations. I am highly doubtful they were baked fresh that morning, as they were too hard and even though I'd asked for them toasted, they were not warm. The bagels could also have used more seasoning/seeds. Since it's a bagel place, I wasn't expecting too much from their coffee, but was nevertheless disappointed on this front too. I am giving Bagels on Fire three stars because I still love the concept and hope they do improve, and that my experience was a one-time thing."}
{"text":"The fresh bagels are crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside.  Pumpernickel bagels and the pretzels are kid favourites.  We keep going because we love quality, fresh baked goods."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best bagels in the City if you like Montreal style bagels. They open at 6am and I sometimes bring fresh hot bagels to work and everyone loves them there too. Very nice people too!"}
{"text":"Meh...good imitation of st. Viateur bagels...but not the authentic taste..sorry guys u let me down...for $9 per dozen ..i wont b back...this review from an ex montrealer who knows what a real bagel tastes like."}
{"text":"Really good Montreal-style bagels, which are about 1/3 the size of American (west coast style thin bagels) with a soft inside, even when toasted. Bagels on Fire also has a good assortment of bagels too.   Plenty of cream cheese and lox on my toasted onion bagel. Yum!"}
{"text":"I went in at 7:53 pm, the door was open the lights are on, I ask about a sandwich and the server was so disinterested and suddenly said; \"actually we're closed\". Your door is open, lights are on, what are you talking about? Then it took her three times to warm up a cheese filled bagel, that was stale. And when I left, the door was still open for business. Such lazy lazy lazy employees.  Great business model, you're open for business but don't want to serve people because it's too close to closing time and you might have to dirty a knife to spread some cream cheese, and work 1 minute after your shift ends. Shut the damn door next time.  Useless."}
{"text":"These are not very good bagels.  And they make their breakfast sandwiches by microwaving the eggs (um, you have a wood burning oven---use it). An extra star for the wood fired, handmade experience right in front of your eyes, but as my wife said 'I love even a bad bagel, but these are awful...'"}
{"text":"Really good bagels with cream cheese and lox.  Perfectly toasted.  Unfortunately they don't sell decaf coffee so you have to go next door.  Service was quite good.  Worth going to again.  Seems to be a local favourite handout spot."}
{"text":"They have really yummy bagels here but the service is really slow and I also seem to have to repeat my order several times for some reason. Again, the bagels are really good. I find the prices a little high for what it's is. Bottom line, bagels are good but service needs to improve!"}
{"text":"This place has the best bagels in the city. We stop by every Saturday and Sunday mornings after a long run for bagels, cream cheese and great Kiki g Horse coffee."}
{"text":"Always a great place to pick up a yummy bagel! Hazel and Joel and great owners, and pour their hearts into this business! The prices are great! And their product is fresh and yummy! if you are in the beaches, this is a great place to pick up a quick and yummy snack!"}
{"text":"LOVE the bagels here!! Best bagel spot in the beaches. The quality of the bagels and cream cheese here puts Tim's to shame! Definitely check this place out if you are looking for a fast and inexpensive breakfast!"}
{"text":"Excellent little shop and reasonably priced. Lots of selection, top notch coffee and friendly service."}
{"text":"Decent Bagels. I normally jump in here on my way to work and they definitely do some good business so it isn't just me.  They say they do Montreal style thinner bagels but the ones i've had are usually a bit doughier and would be more NY style than Montreal.  Good overall though."}
{"text":"Came in at 6:05am to freshly baked sesame bagels. Two friends and I all ordered sandwiches (lox bagel, breakfast sandwich), they were all great! Bagel was toasted even after coming right out of the oven so it was quite crispy - I wonder what it would be like if it wasn't toasted. Would recommend to friends!"}
{"text":"The best bagels in the city. I used to drive North to get the best but Bagels On Fire has saved me gas money. These are fresh, delicious and authentic. Try the lox and cream cheese on an everything bagel. It's the best."}
{"text":"Holy shit these bagels are good. Like SO GOOD.  I love this place's super cute story of bagel shop love. He a bagel cook, she a bagel shop cashier, they fall in love and open a bagel shop - like c'mon!  Ok, for real these bagels are toasty, chewy deliciousness. They were still warm when I brought them home. I got 1/2 dozen ($5) 3 poppy, 3 sesame - big mistake I should have got 1 dozen ($8) and not shared any with my husband.  The lady on the cash was very nice (she coo'ed at my baby and called him incredibly cute which of course makes you my best friend) so the service was quick and friendly.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Bagels on Fire offers a variety of Montreal Style bagels. I don't know what that means but it sure sounds good.   You have a couple of options. You can order bagel sandwiches with classic styles like salmon and cream cheese, or specialty like Montreal Smoked meat.   You can also get their fully loaded bagel sandwiches which are jammed packed with additional toppings.   Finally, you can also buy a dozen bagels.   Overall, liked the place quite a bit, and worth a visit when you're near Queen East."}
{"text":"Really great spot in the Beaches!   Always friendly service and the bagels are always fresh out of the oven.   They offer different flavours of cream cheese which is always great to switch up.   True montreal style"}
{"text":"The Montreal bagels are a must have! Lox and cream cheese bagel are always a winner too. The dough stands out from other bagel places and makes the drive for bagels worthwhile. My partner loves them."}
{"text":"I go get my bagels from this place all the time. Not only are the bagels always fresh and authentic to Montreal style bagels but the service is always friendly and fast. They keep it simple with ingredients to include on your sandwich; however, from the bagels to the deli meat - everything is always super fresh and flavourful."}
{"text":"I tried the BLT, and the bread was toasted to perfection. The bacon was nice and crispy.   They know just how much of one ingredient to use in a sandwich.  They have a nice oven at the back, and nice seating at the front.   Could anyone ask for more than what they have on the menu?  The service is really good and also very fast. Service sometimes makes the food taste good."}
{"text":"Based on the great reviews I had to come try this place and they didn't disappoint!  They are just off the busy part of Queen but worth the drive over.  I had the Montreal smoked meat bagel sandwich on a pumpernickel bagel which was so good!  The bagel was a bit crispy on the outside but chewy on the inside.  I also bought the challah bread since it was Friday and it too was good.  A bit more dense than other ones but made for some great French toast the next day!  I will be going back for sure!  It's as good as we will get outside of Montreal."}
{"text":"Great bagels. They have smoked salmon. You can buy almost all the stuff there to make your own smoked salmon bagel sandwiches. They also sell butter. Bagels by the dozen or half dozen. Freshly baked. Interesting flavors like coconut which is better than it sounds. They appear to make cream cheese in house or at least sell it in bulk. The herb and garlic one is light, not strong like the one at your run of the mill mediocre coffee chain.   They have a wood burning oven. Full on firewood logs in there.   Definitely a grab and go location, not a sit-down place.   Fast, friendly service. Great place to grab a quick bite in the beaches."}
{"text":"Today was my third or fourth time coming here, my usual go to is coconut bagel with butter tastes absolutely delish. Also really enjoy watching the bagels being made and how they are baked it shows true character. Today was my least favourite time visiting here, I ordered a sesame seed bagel with cream cheese. My bagel was smaller than the palm of my hand with 6 seeds on it and you would think that you could choose one of the homemade flavoured cream cheeses, nope. 6/10"}
{"text":"After reading all the good reviews I must say this was a little bit of disappointment. I ordered the lox bagel and there wasn't a lot of salmon but bagel itself was tasty and fresh.   I'd give it another shot seeing as I went on a busy Sunday and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"These bagels are on fire!  This was my first (of many) trip to Bagels on Fire. My family and I were visiting from New York and were all in the mood for a decent bagel for breakfast. I didn't know what to expect from BoF.   Let me start from when I walked in the door, the selection of bagels on display was amazing. They even had a coconut bagel! I opted for the everything bagel which was truly covered in everything. Topped of with a little cream cheese and it was perfect. I seriously would like to explore all f the different bagels they make here.   I loved the fact that the bagels were baked in a brick oven this gave them just a hint of crunch on the crust. They toasted my bagels for me too. They staff behind the counter were very helpful.   I guess my only comment would be that the bagels are on the small side. I ended up having two bagels instead of one. My wife and daughter said they were still hungry after eating their bagels.   I'm going with four stars, I have to hold back because of the size of the bagels.   Two solid thumbs up for the taste and the courtesy of the staff. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Just finished trying my first Montreal style sesame bagel from here - best I've had in my life, slightly sweet with perfect texture. Picked up a dozen for $8 and it's well worth it - will definitely be a repeat customer!"}
{"text":"Best bagels in the city.  Great service. Amazing staff.  Nothing more to add.  It's that simple."}
{"text":"As a NYer, bagels in most other cities don't measure up.   So my review may be a bit tougher.      The bagels: Cuteness factor = 5.   Tiny but good size for kids.    Taste = 4.   A bit too sweet.  Some of them are a little too burnt on the outside.   Chewiness = 3.   Good, but not consistent through out the bagels.  It seems a little under-cooked.   Noticed dough stuck on knife after slicing them in halves.   Varieties = 5.   Lots of different choices.    The shop: Very neat little store front.    No inside seating but there is a bench outside.    Bagels and cream cheese are in full display in their cases.   The blackboard lists all items and prices.     Services: Very efficient.     Summary:   Fairly decent bagels for Toronto, albeit a little smaller.  The kids liked them.  The adults, not so much."}
