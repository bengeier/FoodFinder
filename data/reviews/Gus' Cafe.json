{"text":"Good food with a impressive beer/liquor selection at reasonable prices. Friendly, personable service. Awesome outdoor patio.   Gus' has gone through a few changes in it's short lifetime, but I feel that can be chalked up to them trying to find their place in the Lawrenceville night scene. They're definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"we did like Gus's, but our last two visits were poor. Tonight's visit terrible. We didn't get the food or beer we ordered. The pirogi's were tasteless, the dining room cold because the staff left the back door open. The place wan't staffed properly, only one server (who likely was stoned) and had no idea of how to operate the computer ordering system. How do you staff a restaurant like this? We were so happy to have a neighborhood restaurant (and gluten free) open like this, but I'd say one more bad dinner and we will be done."}
{"text":"What the hell is up with this place? Gave it yet another try and this time it was kind of scary. Our server should not be waiting tables or working around food period. The food is overpriced and just not good. All sauces were watered down and tasteless. We don't need 100 tater tots and watery toppings. How about 1/3 of the amount with quality toppings? I feel for whoever is losing money on this venture, but it's obviously time to bring in someone with a clear vision to save this place."}
{"text":"This place has a lot of kinks that need to be worked out.  First- there is barely any heat, at all.  While the food was good (some items such as the fried pickles were much better than others like the chickpea salad).  The service is pretty bad.  While we were there early in the evening with only few tables, drinks were slow to be served and we waited close to 30 between the time our first entree arrived to the time our last one did. Apparently they forgot to place 2 of the 4 orders and we sat with no drink refills until we asked, however additional staff members continued to come in.  The cook was overheard saying he was getting other orders out first before the food we were waiting on would be prepared.  We were comped after asking for the one entree, and this wouldn't be a fair review without noting that.  Overall food and drinks are over priced for the quality."}
{"text":"A nice chill atmosphere place. Loved the homemade pickles. We could have eaten a basket of the Indian hush puppies with the trio of chutneys. The best and freshest beet salad with goat cheese. The homemade vegan gnocchi Mac and cheese style were light pillows of cheesy goodness.   I liked the beer selection. Old school to hipster.  We ordered something that we really didn't care for and the waitress, manager and chef could not do more to make it right. We were truly impressed.  We will be back   p.s.  Good daily specials."}
{"text":"We went here once to dine in and the service was friendly but slow and forgetful, and the fresh salads we got were pretty good and the dessert crepes were delicious.  then we got take out a week or so later and the food was SLOP.  we ordered fries and got greasy undercooked potato strips, the potato in the perogi was undercooked as well and basically inedible and bland.  i could walk here, but i probably won't be back for a while - lawrenceville has a bunch of other places I could go for a good meal!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the waitstaff is inexperienced and incompetent. Once they lost my order due to a \"computer problem.\" Another time I ordered a burger and fries and they inexplicably served me the fries 1st and separately and then the burger like 20 minutes later. I have no idea why--it wasn't crowded.  Still another time I ordered a bacon cheeseburger and it arrived Without Cheese...! On another occasion they got my order wrong...  Holy Amateur Slackerdom!!!"}
{"text":"It's sad, because I experienced Gus's in their glory days, and they are not like that right now. I have been to Gus's at least a few times since they lost their chef and then the taco truck left and, eventually, you have to start blaming them. The beers are average price - not cheap, not pricey (although they are always strangely out of season) - but the tacos are bad. They taste like someone's mom's attempt at taco night: not deadly, but far from good. They have an amazing backyard, and I really want Gus's to be good - sadly, they are not right now."}
{"text":"Amazing food!  Best I have had in the burg in a long time.  Very affordable, healthy and vegetarian friendly.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"So since gus' has changed, I'm not a huge fan. They only serve tacos now and the feel is just kind of weird. It's spread out inside so you just get this odd basement type feel.. Not a favorite"}
{"text":"I have no idea what is going on here.  Go somewhere else for you veggie/vegan needs.  This place seemed promising, too."}
{"text":"Last Friday I stopped into Gus' Cafe for a quick last minute drink.  Fell in love with their back patio and stopped back Tuesday (9/30/14).  Turns out it was half off burger night. If you know me you know that I typically have one burger per year and I'm glad I chose that designation for this one.  While the Heisenburger wasn't up to the level of Walter White's namesake it still was pretty good, the onions were caramelized perfectly and the bun tasted like it was just baked.  Added a side of belgian fries though I wouldn't call it a side by any means - the tray could feed a small army.  The fries were amazing and not like anything I have ever had though the aioli on the side lacked anything resembling flavor.  My friend I was with opted for the hummus and enjoyed that as well.  Being that it is in Lawrenceville where you better be on point with your beer selection Gus' Cafe didn't disappoint on that end either.  While it seems like Gus' Cafe could add a few servers to the roster I must say the server we had went above and beyond.  As I mentioned I wanted to sit on the patio.  Now the twinkling lights must have clouded my judgement because we knew it was most likely going to rain.  Well the umbrella didn't suffice once the downpour came.  After making a break for indoors I must say it was beyond kind that the server offered to go outside to attempt to bring in our remaining food.  We of course declined, but the offer was appreciated.  Every 'hood needs the neighborhood place that is a step above the typical neighborhood hangout and Gus' Cafe provides that."}
{"text":"Really interesting place.  I had very filling lunch and can't wait to go back and drink there.  Large selection of good beers.  Cool bar.  Lots of elbow room.  Indian hush puppies/pakoras were tasty.  Burrito was big enough to split.  Looking forward to sitting on patio when Pittsburgh warms up and taking in some of the beer selection."}
{"text":"Came here tonight for the first time. I probably won't be coming back. Service was slow-a total of an hour for food to come out. It was understaffed. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"I have celiac disease and I am extremely sensitive to cross contamination. Because of that I rarely go out to eat.  My gluten sensitive daughter took me to Gus' Cafe for brunch. While the food took a little while to prepare, once it came out it was obvious that is was made from scratch. The gluten free caramel apple waffles were crispy and moist. The cinnamon caramel apples were fresh and delicious.  It was well worth the wait!  No corners were cut. My daughter's dish was also perfect and delicious. All the food was piping hot and the service was good. I will make the 70 minute drive to return often and I will bring my gluten-loving husband with me. There were many very intriguing non-GF dishes available as well. Ten thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Food is phenomenal, draft and bottle selection stellar, cool and funky vibe without being too hipster, prices extremely reasonable. Owner is very sweet and dedicated, been in the restaurant business for awhile..   It's a new joint, trying to find it's groove.   Cue the updated review in 12 months \"it's overrun with hipsters and reeks of pot and incense!\"  Seriously, places that are this cool never stay nonjudgemental. Pretty soon it will be about your karma and way of life.  So go here if you like good healthy food in a fun atmosphere. And wait 12 months if your shitzu takes anti anxiety medication and you're a vegan - for ethical purposes, of course."}
{"text":"I have had good experiences sitting at the bar but the waitstaff at this place is horrible. They are extremely unattentive and they constantly get drink orders wrong or forget that you even placed an order in the first place. Call either one of these things to their attention and you will get an attitude guaranteed. I don't expect rapid service on a crowded night but I also don't expect to wait 40 minutes to get a drink that I ordered. Our party of 6 was denied a request to have separate checks when we informed the waitress BEFORE ordering anything. Fine. I get it. When we received out check none of our drinks were itemized and instead it just listed \"open bottle\" where the name of the drink should be. How is a party supposed to split up the bill when they can't tell who had what? and more importantly how can we be sure the checks are accurate? We tried to get a check that had more specifics but were denied on that request as well. I want this place to do well because it is a cool spot but they really need to tighten things up and hire a more professional waitstaff."}
{"text":"I have had varying experiences here.  I have had two 5 star experiences where the food was great and service was great.  But one time we had a waitress who-in a rude way- accused us of having fake ID's (we didn't, and proved otherwise).  I'm trying not to let this one bad experience spoil my opinion of Gus's though because again, the food is great, and I like the outdoor seating.   They have a few things that they need to work out, but I see some good potential."}
{"text":"Wow...and not in a good way. Horrible service. Expensive beers, even domestics. Beyond cold inside with no resolution by the management. I and my guests had to wear 2 coats and gloves, inside!  As a person that enjoys many evenings out I will most certainly not be back here."}
{"text":"I just tried this place for the first time the other day and loved it. Food was amazing and the drinks selection was spectacular and reasonably priced.   My girlfriend got a salad and french fries that were both amazing. One of the best salads I have ever had in my life and the french fries were fresh and hand cut. Really great. I got a burrito that wasn't anything too fancy but tasted like some next level Chipotle masterpiece. It was huge too and filled me up after a long day and a skipped lunch.   The best part of the entire meal was our server. I forget her name off hand but I'm going to ask for her if we go back. Super nice and attentive and polite. One of the best waitresses I've ever had."}
{"text":"I work just down the street from Gus's and we were very excited to try them out for the first time after they opened.  The menu is on a blackboard in the back, which is fun.  It seems they are still working out exactly what the more permanent menu will be, so they're using the chalkboard to try things out before they get official menus printed.  The food was fantastic, and not what you would expect from a gluten free restaurant.  I had the Kale & Garlic crepe and it was filling and very, very tasty.  I also tried their fried pickles which were absolutely spot-on.  The batter was crispy and perfectly fried, and the pickle was great as well.  Again, surprisingly good for gluten free.  I also like that they have a number of vegan items on the menu, because I know vegan/gluten free is a really tough market to find food in, and this really hits a great niche market that needed good food.  One thing I saw on the menu that I liked is they offer one of their soups on a \"pay what you want\" scale, with everything over $4 going to a different charity each month.  Very cool concept.  At the moment they are cash-only, which I think could end up being a difficulty.  But they're open in L'ville on Mondays which is a really big bonus.  I am really glad these guys opened and plan on going back again in the future.  I'll update as they get on their feet.  I did hear they aren't planning the official \"grand opening\" until closer to spring, and that right now they're trying a soft open just to test things out and see how a gluten free menu will go over.  I think they'll be great once they get the little kinks worked out."}
{"text":"I've gone twice now, once for breakfast and once for dinner. I prefer their breakfast options, especially the Salted Caramel Crepe. I would also recommend the Cheese Fries (best fries ever!).  My only complaint is the price of beer. Compared to other places (even typically expensive places), this place has a really high priced draft and bottle list. You can get the same beer for a cheaper price pretty much anywhere else."}
{"text":"Now that the Taco Truck has taken over the kitchen at Gus's, we plan to become regulars. We've been twice and enjoyed fast, delicious tacos and good draft beer. The music is just the right volume and we snagged a comfy booth near the back. Our favorite are the jerk chicken tacos, but we've tried them all and never found a bad one. The outdoor seating is going to be a great bonus for summer. Every single bartender and wait staff has been friendly and helpful on both of our visits- we'll be back!  Love that there are vegan and vegetarian taco options and everything is gluten free- finally a place where we can take almost anyone and find something that they can eat."}
{"text":"My Lawrenceville friends have been raving about Gus' Café and when the Groupon came out it was an encouragement to give this place a try. We went on a Saturday night and the owner was very apologetic that they were having an off night due to staffing issues and could not serve the full menu. I was disappointed but glad we were told.  Since I had the Groupon for 2 burgers and fries the owner was able to honor it since it was expiring soon but the wait would be longer.  We were ok with that and happily ordered draft beers and tachos while we wanted. The draft beer selection is great and most of us started off with the German beer Franziskaner. They also had the Black Cherry Mckenzie cider which I also had and Ace Pineapple cider which I will be sure to try out next time.  For starters are group of 6 got the pita and hummus, very healthy and fresh, and tachos-whichare nachos made of tator tots. One serving is huge and enough for a large group.  I ordered the blue cheese/caramelized onion burger with fries and my date got the jalapeno burger.  He was a little disappointed but mine was delicious and the cracked pepper mixed in with the burger gave it a nice kick. Also cooked to my likely and did not take long at all.  Overall a fun night had by all enjoying the large amount of potatoes we consumed and fine beer!"}
{"text":"Really nice place. Great easy parking great walking in area. Right across street from the cemetery on butler street. I wish I had come here earlier."}
{"text":"Service was good and female server very friendly on 1/31.  Burgers were good.  Tachos really failed as cheese sauce was so liquidy that you could not enjoy it over the tater tots.  It all fell to the bottom of the pan.  Might of well just given me the taters with nothing on them.  Jalapeno salsa was nothing to write home about.  Big issue was the Aioli my wife got with her build your own burger.  About 8 hours later, it made her very sick for the last 24 hours.  She has been in the food industry for 20 years and thought something tasted off about it when eating her burger but trusted the establishment.  Bad choice.  Food poisoning sucks.  Bad handling as she was only one to get sick out of 5 people who ordered the aioli and ate everything else the same the prior two days as we had guests and have been dining together.  Good bourbon and beer selection and decent prices. They need to fix their culinary staff and insure everyone is on board with serve-safe, a food handlers safety program to insure others do not get product that was not handled properly."}
{"text":"I went here for brunch with a friend on the most beautiful day of the year so far. I was so happy to see that they had a great outdoor patio area to sit in.  The waitress was absolutely amazing, and I was pleasantly surprised at the extensive beer list (yes, I drank a beer at brunch- no judgements). My friend and I started out with the amazingly good and huge plate of tachos- tater tots and nachos topped with cheese, jalapeno peppers and green salsa. Who could not like that? I also got the breakfast sandwich, which came with eggs, cheese, tomatoes, and the waitress said I could put anything else on it- so of course I added avocados.  And it was incredible! I'm really glad that my Groupon that I bought sent me here, because I will definitely be coming back a few times this summer."}
{"text":"Great place, very relaxed and welcoming. My Wife and I have become regulars. They now have a new menu where they just do Tacos which I was a little stand off-ish about. However, the food comes out faster, tastes amazing and it's a great where to mix it all up. We'll done, Gus's on reinventing yourselves."}
{"text":"Ate here when The Pittsburgh Taco Truck was doing the cooking. Food was pretty decent. Atmosphere and bathrooms are as bad as you would expect in a dive bar. Service was so/so. 2 stars because the only real reason to go was the tacos and they had some kind of falling out with the taco truck, so who knows what kind of food will show up next. Be aware."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice... they've changed their menu atleast 3 times since then. First time - Cali burrito/samosa's/churro type thing/crepes-- it was all AMAZING Second time - Spicy Cajun wings/Fried Pickles/Deep Fried Chickpeas -- these are perfection and I've never wanted anything more than I want these right now.    Both of these are off the menu... looks like I'll have to make another trip...in order to be fair.    This place is on the right track to becoming a very popular destination in Lville."}
{"text":"We were in town for the day and we always like to find a new place to get a gluten free burger since we have only one option where we live.  This is located off a main road in a cute little area of town where a lot of young families can be seen walking their kids/dogs.   The bar looks live a dive, but they offer a good variety of gastropub fare.  Mostly everything is gluten free on the menu and it is stuff you don't find too often (fried pickles, fried oreos).   We were having a late dinner and came in to the place being completely empty.  They offer a good variety of beers on tap and bottles in the case, gluten free included.  We started off with fries and we were not disappointed.  They are double fried and super crispy - warning  - the fries can be shared and very large to get more than two orders for two people.  We each ordered a burger and just to be clear they do not come with a side.  My husband really liked his Heisenburger but my BLT burger on a gluten free english muffin was lacking.  The muffin was very greasy and the burger had no seasoning to it.  I asked for my burger to be cooked medium , but it came back more like medium done.  My burger also came dry with no mayo, which is listed so I had to wait awhile for my mayo - which was much needed since it was overcooked and underseasoned.  I ended up just taking off the meat and had a BLT.   Maybe we'll try it again just to give it another chance."}
{"text":"I stopped in one evening for a quick bite and a beer.  The beer selection was excellent. I had one spicy jerk chicken taco. It was very good and portion size was larger than expected.  I also found this place to be very affordable, and service was friendly. I will be retuning."}
{"text":"This sucks. My mother and I first went to Gus's in August. It was amazing: crispy square gluten free waffle buns, fried pickles, fried gf \"oreos\". She raved about this place and was very excited to bring my father when they came again to visit me.   Fast forward to now: the square waffle machine is broken, the old chef left (where did she go!?) and my mother is spending the rest of her trip sleeping on the bathroom floor, dehydrated from food poisoning.   Now, the server, Sarah, was great,  especially as she seemed to be the only server in the joint with the occasional assistance of some drunk guy (the owner?). We asked her not, but she told the server the food was awful, so it was comped. Now, as someone that will eat anything, I had to verify that the food was in fact terrible. She ordered the BLT. The bacon was excruciatingly crisp, the waffle bun undercooked, mushy, and circular (I know that seems like a weird thing to complain about, but when you are served a couple slabs of meet on an open face waffle, you'll complain too), I didn't try the burger, so we are figuring that's what gave her the food poising.   My vegan adzuki bean burger on the gf English muffin was very good. My father seemed to enjoy his pulled pork burger thing. We all shared the French fries, fried pickles, and fried cookies: delicious. My mother has officially swore to never go there again. She was going to continue to go for the fried pickles but after her sleeping arrangements last night, she can't think about this place without malaise.  I just hope she doesn't need an IV."}
{"text":"HOW can gus's cafe be considered vegan-/vegetarian-/gluten-free friendly?  i made a reservation for 9 vegan/vegetarians, so they were well aware that we were coming.  the menu had a VERY limited selection of vegan/vegetarian options, and the front of the  menu stated that they no longer were gluten-free friendly or something to that effect.  the service was extremely slow.  i had to ask for menus for everyone, and the waitress seemed surprised we were eating - apparently she just  thought we were there to drink - even though we had a reservation.  there were no veggie burgers listed on the menu, so i asked if they had them, and the waitress said that yes, although they did have them (why aren't they listed on the menu????), there were only 3 left!  that left 6 of us scrambling to find something else on the menu, which was not easy, as there were VERY few options for vegans/vegetarians.  this experience was a dud from the time that we arrived until the time that we left.  i have a groupon for this place, which i plan to give to someone, as i'll never return!  DEANA M:  when a restaurant is touted in the pittsburgh post-gazette and the tribune-review as being vegan/vegetarian/gluten-free friendly, that's what they should be.  the articles were geared specifically for that purpose.  gus's is none of those and, therefore, deserves my one-star review."}
{"text":"Just a quick review today...  Visited last night for a few beers and some burgers.    The good- the menu was very clear, easy to read, everything labeled as GF or not, vegan or not, etc...  There were plenty of options for everyone without feeling that it was strictly a vegan restaurant.  We ordered burgers & an order of tater tots.  The burgers were cooked to perfection, just the way we ordered them.  The pickled cabbage that came with them were just a nice little touch to add to the palate.  The tots arrived a little later and were rather 'pale'.  We requested them to be fried a little more and the chef obliged but we knew the tots would end up a little greasy.  They came back mostly brown and fully cooked but I can't help but think if they were left to cook the first the first time- they would have been perfect.  The only thing I was disappointed about was the ketchup.  It tasted a little sour like it had been left out over & over.  I didn't mention this to the bartender but should have.    All in all- it was very good visit and we will be back to Gus's in the future...  :)"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what is going on with Gus' Cafe.  I've been to Gus's a few times and I've experienced their salads and burgers in the past.  They originally aimed for lots of gluten free/vegetarian/vegan options but also had a good tasting burger and possibly the best fries I've ever tasted.  Then they joined forces with the Pgh Taco Truck and now, well, I think they're sticking with the smaller taco menu but no longer affiliated with the food truck.  So the food menu has gone downhill and is pricey for what you get.  I would not recommend Gus' for food at this point.    Drinks are a different story.  They have a good draft selection and I feel like this is where they are (or should be) concentrating.  Expect your Yuengling and PBR alongside some craftier brews helping to create a more dive bar atmosphere.  With hit or miss service and a number of other options in Lawrenceville for both food and drink, it's easy for me to understand why this place never seems busy.  I've gone from being a fan to being on the fence to losing interest in what could have been a great food and craft beer destination."}
{"text":"Decent beer selection and atmosphere. Very nice server who took the time to explain things to us and check on us (and let my friend and I gossip at the table without ordering more food or drinks after dinner).  With gluten free options I would have expected more vegetarian options. I got a grilled cheese and fries that were average."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were walking around Butler Street on a Friday looking for a fairly quiet spot to grab drinks. (A tall order on a weekend evening in the summer!) We'd just chased down the South Side BBQ truck in the strip, and standing elbow to elbow in a crowded bar was not on our agenda. Gus' Cafe had been on our radar and it looked really pleasant from the outside, so we elected to go see what it was all about.   The outside patio was full but really nice. I'd definitely go back and eat out there someday. We sat inside, and the atmosphere was dim and pretty cozy. The walls are covered with chalkboard paint and handwritten menus/specials. One thing I really liked was that a complete list of beers  was written next to the fridge with the bottled beers in it. It's nice to not have to go up and scrutinize a ton of bottles, plus the beer selection can be easily updated on a daily basis. I totally see why people like this place so much! It has one of the best atmospheres in the city. Plus, a Moscow Mule was one of the featured cocktails on their menu. You pretty much can't go wrong with one of those.  A server came over soon after we sat down at a booth and took our drink orders. There was an impressive draft list as well as several $3 drafts from the holidays on clearance so to speak. We chose a pumpkin variety...nothing wrong with a $3 draft of craft beer! The Pgh Taco Truck was working out of the kitchen providing food, so we ordered two tacos from our friendly waitress. I got the Thai chicken with chili slaw, and Kyle got the ground beef with pico de gallo. They were delicious and generously sized for only $4 each. I can't wait to try stop back into Gus' again soon for more tacos! It was definitely a successful evening."}
{"text":"Gus' Cafe offers decent bar food with an equally decent selection for the non-meat eater. The food reminds me of something I would make if I were super stoned, or something I would cook by myself in order to hide my shame ( tachos!).  Our service was great, very fast and attentive. Drink selection was good as well. Extra points for consistently playing good instrumental and electronic music, as well as for the super creepy killer clown painting that was hanging above our booth."}
{"text":"Last night we went to Gus's for dinner.  My boyfriend was given a Groupon from his employer for 2 hamburgers and 2 french fries.  My girlfriend also went with us.  So here is our order.....fried pickles, whole wings and the 3 burgers and fries..First of all, we had the BEST waitress LIZ who was wonderful.  She told us all about the menu and was very personable.  The pickles were fantastic.  The batter was sooo good, just as previous posts have said.  The wings were big and delicious.  By this time, we were so filled from the appetizers, we had little room for the burgers.  My boyfriend ate half of his and he said it was delicious too.  Me and my girlfriend ordered a make your own burger which was so big.  We only had a little taste and then took the rest home for lunch today.  As I am eating it now, you can tell the ground meat is fresh and tasty.  The bacon on it is not your ordinary bacon in the package from the store.  It is thick and plentiful.  The carmalized onions really make the burger.  If you would love a great burger, great service just go to Gus's and ask for Liz!  She is the best and the food was top notch!  We will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Cash only!  Gus' is good.  They had a nice variety of pub food.  The slaw is amazing.  As another warning, the fries are extra.  I like it that way, but I have friends that expect fries with everything.  They offer Clique bottle service for $35.  That is pretty funny.  I need to get back and try the wings.  They look like they might be awesome."}
{"text":"Sean is great! We really enjoyed talking to him. He made us feel less like tourists, gave us lots of insight on the neighborhood. Highly recommend this place! Inexpensive and chill."}
{"text":"Went there Sunday. Inside was too loud for eating, probably ok for just drinking (without talking), so we sat outside. Drinks were very watered down. Food, now managed by PGH Taco Truck was very good and reasonably priced. Staff was very helpful. Overall vibe of the place (apart from the food and service) is that ownership is not concerned with the place feeling more than just an old bar.  I am not in a rush to return, but if someone were to suggest going there I wouldn't fight them on it."}
{"text":"Tonight was the first time I've been to Gus's. It was me, my husband and 4 of our friends. There was plenty of seating and for the place being so open, it was also super cozy. They have a pinball machine and another arcade game which rules. On Tuesdays their burgers are half off. I built my own vegan burger with the (vegan) patty, lettuce, tomato, onion, roasted jalapeños, avocado and spicy brown mustard. You also get a side of their slaw, hummus and a pickle. We also each ordered a side of fries. The food takes a while, but that's because it's made from scratch so it's totally worth the wait. You have to walk to the bathrooms which are upstairs, which wasn't a big deal. We definitely plan on making this a regular spot for us to hit up on Tuesday nights!"}
{"text":"one word:   subpar [suhb-pahr]  adjective    1. below an average, usual, or normal level, quality, or the like; below par:  \"This place and its food are subpar.\"  I have high hopes for this place. I will try it again. next time I hope the bartender gets off her phone long enough to serve us drinks when we need them (being paying customers and everything)."}
{"text":"I really liked the vibe at Gus's. It's a good location and has a good tap list and bottle selection.  I had the daily vegan special which was a spicy burrito and delicious!  Our table opted to split an order of the fries and it took 5 of us to finish it. I wish there were more vegan/vegetarian items. Overall, great food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I was really pumped to go here for the first time, but I was a little disappointed. They do have a sizable outdoor seating area, which is what brought me to check it out on a beautiful sunny day for happy hour. I'd give it another try because of the outdoor space, but I'm not dying to go back.  I've heard lots of claims of this place having an amazing beer selection and they may have at one point, but not when I was there. Multiple kegs were kicked and covered up and a few of the others were winter beers which was not what I was looking for on a spring day, so I ended up opting for something else. I thought the prices were OK, pretty average I'd say.   They had tacos as the food special that day, but were told they could only do chicken because they weren't serving beef for another hour. That's fine. The tacos were OK, served double-wrapped with 2 tortillas which made the whole thing kinda dry. They would have been fine with just one tortilla, we ordered 6 tacos and ended up taking the second tortilla off of each one. We also had an order of \"Tot-chos\" which were tater tots topped with sour cream, salsa and cheese. You can't really go wrong with tater tots!  It was pretty empty when we went inside to eat and the music was cranked up SO loud, I could barely hear my friends across the table. It was like they had the 10pm volume going at 6pm. They have two pinball machines, but they are both set to $1 per game, which I personally think is ridiculous unless you have the newest game on the market. Most places have .50, .75 at the most. $1 per game is just too much."}
{"text":"Finally stopped into Gus' last night for some food and a drink. I am always a fan of a place that goes out of its way to accommodate dietary restrictions!  While Gus' has the appearance of a typical dive bar, upon closer inspection you'll see that it's very clean. We sat at the bar, although there are many cute booths. It's surprisingly spacious.  They had an interesting selection on tap - I got a pumpkin porter, which was really good and not something you see every day. It was only 7:30pm but they were running a reduced food menu - I guess they primarily function as a bar after dark. It was fine, as the reduced menu is quite veg friendly.  I ordered the southwest burger with the black bean patty. It's large, and it comes with a large side of tater tots (or slaw, if you are a fool). The patty is very flavorful. It's a little on the mushy side (I had to eat in a circle, because it kept leaking out the sides), but the whole black beans certainly help. I was very happy with it over all!  A great experience, will come again!"}
{"text":"Same problem as another reviewer. Went today (5/23) for lunch around 12:30 pm and they were supposed to open at 11:00 am. Door was locked and the phone number didn't work. Very disappointing, I was really looking forward to trying the maple bacon burger!"}
{"text":"I've been to Gus's twice so far, unfortunately I didn't make it there when they had more interesting things on their menu such as crepes, etc. The first time I was there I had fish taco's which were ok, they seemed to have a lot of flavorful ingredients in them, but somehow they didn't have very much flavor. My boyfriend enjoyed his burger and fries though.   The second time I returned, (about a month later) the menu had changed and so the only items on the menu were burgers and hot dogs (aside from the apps). Even the salads had burger meat in them. I'm not sure what is going on with the menu changes, but I was really disappointed because I wanted more options other than burgers. I would not have gone in had I known that's all they had. I ordered the Cowabunga burger since my options were limited. I was not asked how I wanted it cooked, neither was my boyfriend who also got a burger. The prices were also kind of steep considering it's $10 and all you are getting is a burger with no side.   When my burger arrived it was cooked more than my liking, and it also lacked flavor, which was weird again, considering the toppings (pineapple, etc). The avocado slices on top of it were also turning brown. It was not horrible, but disappointing, and there are much better places to get burgers in the city."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but it didn't follow through on several levels.   Being a vegan,  it seemed like there weren't a ton of options. They had run out of vegan pancake batter (really, on a Saturday morning?) so I got the squash soup and split the pakoras with my dining companions.   The pakoras were ok; I couldn't really taste any veggies in them but the chutney trio was tasty.  Our waitress seemed to have forgotten about my soup and needed to be reminded about it. When I did get the soup,  it was ok. It really only had one flavor. I also tasted my boyfriend's bean burrito; it was incredibly bland. I have no idea how they could make beans and rice so tasteless.   After all this, our total was $33. If the meal had been impressive I wouldn't complain about the price. But for poor service and bland food I was very disappointed.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"I like Gus'! The service we had was awesome, the food was delicious and healthy and they had a nice selection of drinks! My dining mate and I had the Tom Ka soup (super yummy-huge portion), the Asian slaw (again super yummy and a huge portion), the curry/masala crepe, and the Nutella crepe. Now, before you accuse me of gluttony--I had never been here so we assumed the soup and slaw were small (like side portions) so that is why we ordered three things to split. Also, they gave us the Nutella Crepe complimentary to try (woo hoo!) Everything was really yummy and flavorful, our waitress was super nice and attentive. I see the other review about it being cold--it was pretty chilly in there but it was also -3 outside...sooooo...  Pros: +Good Food (everything we had was good) +Good Service +Good concept--check out the chalkboard menu in the back about the donations  Cons: -Chilly (wear a coat- it's the middle of the coldest winter in Pittsburgh)  Anyway, I recommend this place! At least try it out! !"}

{"text":"I'm torn between writing this now, or giving Gus'another chance to wow me. I mean it was okay food, it didn't wow me. Oh, cash only, no debit or credit cards, ATM in the hallway leading to the restrooms.  Going by a few of the previous reviews of Gus'I was expecting a little more than what it turned out to be. This is your basic Pittsburgh dive bar with better than average food. Good beer menu, top notch liquor and good happy hour specials.   I went for the food based on the fact they had vegan options. For starters, I wish I could say I had a great hummus. I can't. What I was served was a pretty forgettable hummus that resembled clay and lacked any salt, or other flavors associated with hummus, like lemon, garlic, olive oil, tahini, salt, salt, salt, or salt. It was almost like they opened cans of garbanzo beans, whizzed them around in a food processor, sprinkled paprika on top to make it look halfway decent and served it up with pita. The menu offered either pita or vegetables, but I wasn't given the option. Epic fail!  For my entree I decided on the roasted vegetable sandwich, forgoing the black bean burger which has been done to death. The sandwich came with eggplant, portobello mushroom and canalized onions on grilled bread. It was okay, didn't wow me. Could have used the crunch of some lettuce or perhaps the peppery bite of radicchio, anything for some texture. I will give them kudos for the gluten free, vegetarian, and vegan options. For a dive bar, the food is good, but there is something to be said for a little epicurean imagination, like salt and fresh lettuce, or tomato for a sandwich. I will say the red cabbage slaw that accompanied my sandwich was good and I should have put it on my sandwich to wake up the flavor.   Two beers, an appetizer, and sandwich was 23 bucks, not bad. One beer was half price during happy hour. Great daily specials and happy hour, brunch Saturday's and Sunday's.  One last tidbit, the online menu hasn't been updated in awhile and many things have changed, except the signature items. Also, I had to ask for salt and pepper after my meal arrived."}
{"text":"Loved the PGH Taco Truck so I thought coming here would afford us the same quality but really the tacos just seemed a bit off when we went on a Saturday night.  Not bad but just ok. WE sat outside.  Really its a concrete walled patio with nothing special about it.  You can tell its a favorite of people living nearby and draws an eclectic crowed for sure.  The draft beer list was pretty limited when we went and I ordered a draft cider that seemed watered down.  Weird.  The waitress was super friendly and very attentive but you know, it was just ok.  I think if I lived in walking distance I would be here more but its not a place you need or want to make a trip out to because I'm not sure what they really offer that would bring you here more then once.  So wanted it to be better."}
{"text":"This is your typical neighborhood dive bar, nothing less and nothing more.  I was here for a dog meetup.  There was a very eccentric group of people here.  It was a Thursday night and pretty dead.  They offered free draft beers and well drinks for about an hour.  I swear everyone that was there had to be a smoker since there were constantly people going in and out to have a smoke break.  Had there not been a special event there I wouldn't have been there.  After seeing the scene and clientele there I can pretty much guarantee you that I won't ever be going back.  Just not my scene."}
{"text":"Been here twice so far.  First time owner paid for everything but refused our Groupon, so we went back at least one month later to use our Groupon before it expires.  - NOT REALLY A VEGAN FRIENDLY JOINT (yet????)  Not very vegan unlike it claims.  Options for vegans when we last went there were: beet side salad, french fries (only one type, other type is made with bacon fat), pickle (seriously? yes the menu points out 'a pickle' as a vegan option).  Lots of opportunities for them to change but this was time #2 we visited Gus' Cafe.   The first time they had one vegan appetizer called \"pakora\" this time they did not.   We talked to the owner of Gus' (George who used to run Harris Grille) last time we went and he assured us the menu at that point was 'a mere preview' and that the restaurant, while open and operating, was 'not really open' and only in 'preview' mode, awaiting their official opening sometime in a few months.  I made lots of suggestions for how with slight tweaks the menu could become a great vegan friendly offering.  (I complained that there were no true entree offerings for vegans, and the Groupon said Vegan Bistro.)    No Vegan hot dog replacements, in a place with 6 hot dog options. No Vegan burger replacements, in a place that has 10 burger options. No Vegan TVP chili replacement. Questionably vegan bread (uses eggs we think, so not vegan). No Vegan entrees except salads made with tofu instead of meat (but dressing for the recommended Veganizable chicken-quinoa salad was made with honey which is not Vegan).  - Beer offering was reduced:  Flash forward a few months and they 'rebooted' their menu (removing the chickpea pakora appetizer which the chef assured me would be \"back next week\"), the reboot of their menu looks surprisingly like their old menu.  They got rid of one great beer brand offering, decreasing the local draft brew options significantly.  And they do not seem to get anything from the two local breweries.   - Pros: my dinner partner liked the quinoa, and I liked my beef burger, though \"medium rare\" meant \"mostly raw\" (medium rare is pink but firm, not pink and then raw center which is termed 'extremely rare' or 'rare')."}
{"text":"We were excited to make our first trip to a TRUE gluten-free restaurant in Pittsburgh. Despite if being a miserably cold evening, we found the joint with little trouble. The sign could be lit a little better since you could pass it really easy. Gus's had a nice friendly I've to it but it was pretty cold inside, but it didn't matter. The menu changes often and is written on the chalkboard painted walls which is a great idea. There's a super beer selection, both draught and bottles...but no gliten-free. We started with Crepes filled with a variety of savory ingredients. The Kale and garlic was the favorite followed by the mushroom and cheese. The potato stuffed crepe was also good...a hat tip to pierogies? Each were around d 5 bucks. Normally, gluten free offerings are priced off the chart. Not here. I had the Cali Burrito which was rich in flavor...as wall all the burritos our table orders. The wrapping is a little fluffy which added a little something... We ended with the sweet Crepes: Carmel and lemon (awesome). We met the owner, George, who was a great guy, and who alluded to more to come in the near future. All-in-all this was a great place, especially for gluten free folks but even those who like a good, flavorful, reasonably price evening out."}
{"text":"Eating gluten free, this place is close to perfect. Third time there. The food has been great every time. Belgian fries, chickpea fries, gnocchi, pierogi, pakora, soups, and desserts -- churros, deep fried \"oreos,\" crepes, and  a good brunch menu too. Kids had bananas Foster waffles, blueberry muffins. If you're GF you what a treat all this is, and it tastes great. Anxious to try their burritos next. Really great service too. Attentive, knowledgeable. Good beer list, plenty of crafts, and of course some GF options. A nice addition to the Butler St restaurant scene."}
{"text":"Checked out Gus's on Wednesday for Geeks who drink. Game was awesome and the employees were super attentive and nice. The downfall of this little place is absolutely no insulation. It was frigid. I felt like I was in the beer refrigerator, my friend and I had to both keep our heavy jackets on and I had to wear my hat the whole. Do you know how hard it is to think about trivia when you can't feel your body? It's hard..my recommendation come in spring and summer, or if going now wear layers."}
{"text":"It had been quite some time since we last went to Gus's cafe, and it's definitely changed quite a bit. I was a big fan of the place when it first opened. Despite not having any dietary restrictions, myself, I found their fully gluten-free menu to be excellent. The gluten-free wraps they used in their burritos were awesome (think crepe texture), and the food tasted fresh and delicious!  We had heard that the menu approach changed a while back, but only recently returned to find that Gus's is essentially a burger bar now. They've got burgers of all types...a list crazy enough to fit the plethora of dietary restrictions, both forced and chosen, of nearly any customer who stops in. Unfortunately, I wasn't feeling very adventurous on our latest visit, so I can't speak to any of the more interesting options, but the plain burger was decent. The burger, itself, was pretty basic, but nicely cooked. Oddly enough, the waitress didn't ask me how I wanted it prepared. The burger came out more on the well done side, which isn't my preference, but since I hadn't made a request on doneness and it wasn't too dried out, I opted to enjoy as-is. Overall, the burger reminded me of a Fuddrucker's patty (that's actually a compliment, btw). The kaiser bun was huge, and really overwhelmed such a basic burger (lettuce, tomato, onion, and American cheese). We requested to not have the buns toasted, but I'd probably recommend toasting next time to maybe help the dryness of the buns a bit. Regardless, I would get the plain burger again. With some minor adjustments to my order, it would be a really good burger.  Be warned that a side of fries is pretty big. We each got a side of fries, and immediately realized when they arrived that a single order would've been enough for two. I would also recommend their full wings. They're not fried, which is a nice change, and they were really meaty. $1.50/wing might initially sound expensive for a wing, but your perception will change when they're delivered to the table. My wife got two wings and that was plenty for her.  The service was good, our waitress was attentive, and the food came out quickly. The atmosphere is sort of a cross between Double Wide and a dive bar. It's clean, very open, and well lit, despite a lack of window light. They have a nice outdoor area on the side, and a few tables out front (obviously not applicable this time of year), but it would definitely make a decent spot in the warmer months. While I missed the availability of some of the original menu items on our last visit, I did find their menu intriguing enough to want to go back next time I'm in the mood for a burger."}
{"text":"I went to Gus's once and haven't been back. There was loud electronic music playing the whole time, so it was really hard to talk. I had the sloppy joe, which was good, but overpriced seeing that no side came with it. Just a really weird experience."}
{"text":"I've been to Gus' Cafe a number of times since it opened and I've been waiting to give it a fair review. So glad I waited!   The change in chefs and staff was just what Gus needed. The negative reviews here on Yelp are, I think, now in the past. Inconsistencies in the availability of menu items - no pickles on hand to make the signature fried pickles, running out of salad mix at 11:30 a.m. or staffing problems - chef busy talking on her cellphone instead of getting food out, inattentive waitstaff - are issues no longer. If you want a damned fried pickle, you can HAVE it because this kitchen staff remembered to order pickles!   So let's look at what Gus' does right. Starting with the fried pickles. Long spears of tart, green dill pickles, coated in a crisp, crunchy, slight spicy batter accompanied with a creamy fresh dill dressing for dipping is an absolute must for me. The best part is you'd never know they're gluten-free - that extra crunchiness is because of the rice flour used in the batter. You do know that Bobby Flay uses rice flour in his fish batter for the ultimate crunch, right?   Suggestion...why not make the most of that light and crunchy batter by adding fish and chips to the menu? Big, crisp onion rings? Fried zucchini? Take advantage of what you've got going for you!  If lemon crepes are on the menu, don't miss them! Light, sweet, tart...and again, gluten-free. You know, I really hesitate to mention that almost everything is gluten-free. I think some people assume gluten-free is substandard to gluten-FULL. Not true at all!  Oftentimes, gf is better! The fried pickles for instance.   The fries are awesome, the tots are amazing...don't make the mistake of ordering more than 1 order for your table as they come heaped high on a cafeteria tray! Honestly, you could share an order with a couple of tables. Order them plain or with toppings of your choice.   Everything above sound big time fattening? Maybe. So order a great big salad or great big delicious omelet. Mexican-ish items abound...tacos, enchiladas...even the abovementioned tots get a south-of-the-border twist.  Oh, and Gus's has a full bar so brunch can be accompanied by a bloody Mary or Bellini if you so desire or a fine craft beer or two with dinner."}
{"text":"We went to Gus's with a few friends. Got a chance to talk to the owner George, he is a real nice guy.  Bartenders and wait staff are very attentive. We got to try a few items on the menu.  Their grilled chicken wings are awesome, flavorful and juicy.  I believe they brine their wings.  Beet salad, tachos, burgers and French fries are great as well.  We do feel that chairs could be a bit more comfy though. We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"On Mondays, Gus's entire menu is half-off. Yes, you read that correctly. That, combined with their half-off drafts for happy hour, made me more than willing to pig out a little.  However, my pig out wasn't all that satisfying. My threesome ordered the tachos (tater tots with cheese, jalepenos, and salsa), fries with cheese and bacon, the salmon burger special, and a custom veggie burger.  Gus's menu states \"Your food is being made from scratch, so be patient!\" I fear that this may actually be Gus's gastronomic downfall, as the tastiness of their food varies wildly each time that I visit. This time, the tots were under-cooked and the cheese sauce somehow managed to be much more of a texture than a taste. For junk food, it sure was bland. The salmon burger was nowhere near as scrumptious as last time, and the veggie burger came with some of the ugliest, palest slices of tomato I've ever seen.  That being said, Gus's food still has an opportunity to catch its' stride. With a little tweaking, increased consistency, and a touch of pizzazz, this could be a great, affordable burger joint.  Where Gus's gains its stars is in its beer selection. With delicious heavy hitters such as Delirium Tremens, Atwater Vanilla Java Porter, and Franziskaner on tap, I love stopping in here for a brew. Their bottle selection is pretty great too.  Come on, Gus's, I have faith!! If you need some consulting from a neighbor, give me a call. :)"}
{"text":"I've tried to go here twice now on a Saturday. They say that they open at 11am, but have not been open both times that I have arrived at around 1130am.  I spoke with a few locals and they informed me that the owner \"opens up when he wants.\"     Looks like a great menu that I will never try. I don't expect this place to last long."}
{"text":"Awesome place!   Closest thing Pittsburgh has to a non-pretentious pre-gentrified Williamsburg BK type spot that has a great outdoor patio on the way!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine who is diabetic and is on a restricted diet opted to eat at Gus'  as per my suggestion prior to catching WWE Monday Night Raw at the Consol Energy Center recently and left satisfied, their vegan, organic, and gluten-free menu items proving to be more than edible for him. Not a single complaint had he.   Mine were few and minor. My Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles-inspired Cowabunga burger had on it avocado that was slightly under-ripe and a colorful red pepper aioli that I wish had more zip to it. Despite that, the char-grilled beef was cooked to a medium-rare that was nearly ideal and topped with a juicy grilled pineapple ring that brought with it sweetness, acidity, and overall Polynesian thwack. The toasted bun had just enough chew and crispness to it, and the bundle of Belgian frites that accompanied the burger was a twice-cooked, brittle, fluffy, expertly seasoned fryolator accomplishment.   Speaking of things that emerge from bubbling vats of hot fat, the deep fried Oreos or \"Fried Chocolate Cream Cookies\" as Gus calls them, were effortlessly guilt-inducing and conjured memories of carnivals past. The white filling of each Oreo became a luscious buttercream as the chocolate discs morphed into so much warm cake from the internal steam that was created by the hearty, elastic pancake batter that encased everything. Nutella was served as a dipping sauce, recalling a rich ganache in this barfood scenario.   The garage-like decor is a little unfinished, unintentionally giving the place a dive-ish charm that some may find off-putting initially. Nevertheless, the smiling, cartoony, almost iconic visage of \"Gus\" himself will greet you as you break the threshold to this fun, clever, pop culture-loving restaurant in which folks from across the spectrum should find themselves welcome.   P.S. CASH ONLY!!! I thoughtlessly failed to research this part ahead of time and somehow didn't notice the signs. An ATM is on the premises, thankfully.   P.P.S. Gus' ENTIRE food menu is half-off on Mondays. Burgers are half-off on Tuesdays. Gus' also holds open mic nights and the like complete with DJ's. Keep up with them via social media and enjoy yourselves.  P.P.P.S. Our server was an absolute doll."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place for a while, as it's right down the street from me, but I never seemed to find the time. Then I saw that the Taco Truck was doing all it's food and I made the time.   My husband and I went for a date night and waited at the truck to get tacos and then sat on the awesome patio. We had to go inside for drinks and pay with cash (luckily there was an ATM inside). It was a great night.   The last time we were there we had a group and wanted to try the new brunch. We got there right at opening and actually had to wait for the doors to be unlocked. We sat outside, put up our own umbrella and then ordered at our table. My husband and I each got the Totchos (tator tots with taco toppings) and I fell in love with this bad-for-you comfort food! I am craving it now thinking about it! My friends got the breakfast tacos and the portions were so big they could have all shared. We ended up all getting water to drink, as it was too early for us to want alcohol and they don't serve COFFEE!! That was a bummer for brunch. We also brought our toddler son and he made himself at home. I'm glad we could eat outside so I didn't feel quite so bad having a baby in a bar.   We'll be back as everything was so delicious and the atmosphere is quite cool!"}
{"text":"This seems like a great place for a cold beer on a hot summer day. The space is big and the ambiance is an upscale divebar. Does that make sense? I didn't think so but I'm sure you'll get it when you stop in. Great beer selection, friendly staff, and great food.  Gus is vegan friendly but I feel like they could add on a few more items to draw in a few more vegans. With that said, however, all vegans and non-vegans should come have the chocolate mousse here. It is to die for. Have not stopped thinking about it. Come in on Thursdays and all vegan items are discounted. Also, their front outdoor seating is dog friendly.  In sum: YES, YES, YES!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like tacos but left unimpressed.   Tried the jerk chicken- it was ok but very salty my wife felt the same way about the Thai chicken taco.   Second up was the Korean steak taco. Not salty but no tastes stood out. We also tried a calamari taco - it turned to mush and was very bland.   Maybe we came on a bad night. People really seem to like it here. Give it a try and let me know what you think."}
{"text":"I have been eating gluten free for about two years now, and a place like this is perfect! I can order anything I want. This place gets 4 stars from me just for the fact that it meets my dietary needs.  Went for lunch with a half off deal from Facebook (print it out and bring it if you want to use it) but it was empty when we got there around 1.  I ordered the vegetable pakora with chutney trio and then I had the garlic and kale crepe, since I read good reviews about it. I really liked it! The cheddar and mushroom crepe was also delicious. They were out of fried pickles when we got there, but the server said they got their shipment in while we were there and they made me a batch to go! Definitely try these!! They also come with a house made sauce that is delicious. I can't wait to try everything!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been regulars at Gus's for some time now and were in love with their old menu. I am one of those weirdos that can't do gluten. So the Waffle Burger was my go to. So when we stopped in one day and they told us that they were beginning a partnership with the PGH Taco Truck we were a bit unsure.  The good news is that our reservations about the food truck takeover were unnecessary. The Taco Trucks tacos are fresh, fast and delicious. Gus's also has an insane amount of options for beers, Kombucha and now seasonal cocktails. The cocktails were a pleasant surprise and are really great! Also, they mix it up from time to time with different food trucks coming from time to time. so it's worth checking before you come.   Because it is so quick and diverse this is a great place to meet up with a large group. People can come and go as they please and order food and drinks at their own pace.   Well done guys!"}
{"text":"This is a story about not judging a book by it's cover. Maybe we should start by mentioning that you might not even judge the book, because you simply walk past it. Or drive past it in my case.   I had no clue this place existed other than hearing my friend Kerri M raving about it. So I popped in my directions and headed down Butler Street, only to pass right by... twice. It's basically a brick wall and a door. But then you walk in and the walls are covered in art and graffiti (like cool graffiti art) and it's a friendly and welcoming atmosphere.   You definitely don't come here for healthy food. It's a menu chalk full of burghers, fries, and wings and I'm perfectly fine with that! The wings are actually regular sized chicken wings, not legs. If you think you get messy eating tiny chicken wings, you're in for the mess of the century with these. They are loaded with sauce (which I love!) and messy! Don't go here on a first date, unless you already decide you're comfortable enough to gaze lovingly across the table with sauce smeared across your face.  I had the honey BBQ and jalepano and they were great, LOVED the sauces and had tons of flavor, but since they're a wing and not a leg, you have to work for your meat, so get ready to dig!   I also had the tot-cho's, which were incredible. It's a whole baking tray of tots, smothered in cheese, onions, peppers, tomatoes and potentially other random things and it's every bit as delicious as you're envisioning right now.   I'm really happy to discover this place and happy to come here again, plus they have free wifi, so I'll be camped out here with my laptop covered in sauce!"}
{"text":"OK, Gus' has def grown on me.  I've been a loyal patron of Gus' since their opening and have seen and experienced their growing pains.  I'm glad I waited till now to review, though, b/c I think Gus' has found their identity and the kinks are worked out.  The vibe is for-sure hipster, and the staff are warm & friendly (esp my fav bartender Victoria!).  The beer selection is solid, offering around 10 different draft options and many bottles to choose from.  And if you like PBR (or just want to get drunk on the cheap), they have two can options and two different size draft options at $1.50 and $2, respectively.  Drafts (except for PBR since it's already so damn cheap) are half off for happy hour, 4-6 pm.  If the weather cooperates, enjoy that PBR on their roomy outdoor patio.  Oh those tachos (tator tots served like nachos) - yum!  Soo good, esp the handmade salsa served on the side.  Get the yogurt to go with them for the small upcharge - really adds to the dish.  They give you a whole hell of a lot of tots, plan to share with 2-3 of your friends.  Since you have already indulged, go ahead and treat yo-self to the fried oreos.  Heavenly!  I'd be remiss if you I didn't tell you about the burgers.  Gus' serves grass-fed beef burgers at a very reasonable price, esp if you come on Tuesday for half off all burgers!  This is worth repeating - HALF OFF GRASS-FED BURGERS, PEOPLE!  Lots of unique options, too, inc a Waffle Bacon Burger and Gyro Burger.  Food is served until 930pm weekdays, 1030pm on weekends.  Gus's is cash only, and they do have an ATM on-site to ease that burden on you.  Check their social media often for different specials, discounts, and events."}
{"text":"Warning: Gus's now only serves tacos. From a taco truck. I'm not even sure how that works. Are the tacos made on the truck?Does the truck drop off the tacos? How long do the tacos sit around? Or does the truck bring in the ingredients and the tacos are made fresh at Gus's? There are just so many questions.   A friend and I had stopped here a couple of months ago with a groupon. It was so good that we decided the come back. Alas, the delicious burgers are no more.   I don't really care for tacos so I probably won't be going back to Gus's. What a disappointment."}
{"text":"This pains me to do, only two stars. I mean it, I like Gus'. Good beer selection, atmosphere, classic arcade game in the back. It is an enjoyable place. I have been there a handful of times and genuinely enjoyed myself. But, it still deserves this review.  Got the Heisenburger, fries and pickles last night with friends. It was equal parts interesting and unappetizing.   The pickles were, as always, on point. The sauce (buttermilk something or other I think) was pretty weak and a little bland. Otherwise, well done.  The burger was a failure. Asked for medium and got something north of well done. The peppercorn was more than scorched and the meat itself had the rich color of mortar. At times I enjoyed the interaction the blue cheese had with the caramelized onions, but by and large this was a swing and a miss.  Fries were good as always. The aioli was spot on and the salty greasiness of the taters is the stuff of boardwalk dreams .   All in all, I am being a little hard on Gus'. I think upon further review it deserves a three. Damn those delicious pickles!"}
