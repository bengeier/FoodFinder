{"text":"This was our 4th rainforest cafe we have visited. My son picked it for his 5th birthday dinner, worst rainforest expierence ever! Our waitress was very rude, our order was incorrect twice, and she kept making it worse, by screwing it up more, I didn't realize a plain cheeseburger was so hard! For a $200 bill I didn't realize we would have to beg so much for re-fills and correct food. My son enjoyed it, and at the end of the day that was what was important, however next year I'll talk him into something else!!"}
{"text":"Great staff, decent food & fun atmosphere for the kids! Very roomy & comfortable setting."}
{"text":"We've been to this location twice. Yorkdale mall doesn't have a lot of food options for the whole family. The food court is small, and always packed. Some food booths you'll have to wait in line for 20 minutes just to place your order. Very hectic.
The other restaurants are geared towards adults even though they do have food options for your kids. 

Since it's in a mall always expect that it will be busy, especially during the weekends.
When you first see the outside decor of the restaurant, it looks like a fun, happy place for family dining. It's definitely geared towards kids and families. Once you go inside, it's a little dark, very noisy and some tables are too close together. 

Staff on both occasions look like they were at wits end, understandable with all the background noise, screaming kids, screaming parents and a few rude customers having issues about \"mistakes\" with their orders. 

My kids like the chicken tidbits, tastes like Jane's chicken nuggets to me. Frozen, breaded chicken nuggets. On both occasions I had the Mojo bones(the ribs) and my wife had the Mountain chicken sandwich(1st visit) and the Amazon Fajitas(2nd visit)

On both occasions we had the wings for appetizers. Wings tasted like the Wings from Wing Machine. Sauce was not great, generic buffalo wing sauce, carrots and celery on the side.

The bones was similar to Swiss Chalet ribs. Cooked far too long and the sauce tasted like the Smokey BBQ sauce KFC uses on their boneless wings. Nothing you couldn't find anywhere else with the same generic sauces.

My wife didn't like the chicken sandwich. Chicken was dry, small sandwich. Nothing inspiring and very similar to chicken sandwiches at every other restaurant in Toronto. She liked the fajitas, the sauce was good but the rice was cold and hard. Small portions for the fajitas.

Was this place worth going to twice? Not really, food is not inspiring. Atmosphere is fun at first but the loud back ground noises and dim lighting wear you down after a while. Prices are very high for basic, frozen food recipes.

Would your kids like it? My kids liked the first visit because it's something different but didn't care as much for it on our second visit. If you don't expect much going in, you'll enjoy your first visit. Any other visit after that....................

A 2.75 star but in Yelps 5 star system, I hesitantly give 3 stars"}
{"text":"I was visiting the Mills Mall & I was very excited with the idea of trying the Rainforest Cafe. At first everything was going well, but soon after our order was taken we were quickly forgoten. I found this quite surprising since we mentioned this was our 1st visit here and the place was quite empty!!! The food was mediocre at best some of the order was even cold!!! Needless to say I will not be coming back"}
{"text":"Came here a little after 4pm on a weekday...wasn't busy, seated immediately, served quickly, polite service, etc.  Food was ok but, it's not exactly Ruth's Cris or Morton's Steakhouse.  People complaining about the price...where do you think you are?  Vegas hasn't had cheap food for a long time.  Would give it 3.5 stars but that wasn't an option.  Salads are overdone with dressing so get it on the side.  Chicken sandwich was pretty good, fries were pretty good.  Happy hour drinks at the bar only but, they are cheap (not a lot of alcohol).  Artichoke dip was pretty good.  Music is a bit loud but not overwhelming."}
{"text":"We came here because it was my Son's choice for his birthday. If it wouldn't have been for his birthday, we would have left, even though it's a hour + drive from our home. As others have mentioned, the service is very slow. We had to wait a few minutes to be seated even though there was no one in front of us. Once seated, we had to wait a while before our waitress came. By the time she came, we already knew what we wanted to order, so we went ahead and gave it to her. The group sitting next to us got their food before us. About 10-15 minutes after that we asked the manager. After he checked on the order, he informed us that our waitress had not put in our order. He then offered us 50% off our meal, and put our order in. We got our food fairly quick after that. I was hoping to be offered something small prior to our food, but no such luck. Everyone was pleased with the food. My club was just an average club though. When we got our check, they charged us for an adult size soda with the kids meal. It was supposed to include a drink. It was also my son's birthday, so we informed them. They came over and sang and gave him a cupcake. They then charged us for the cupcake also. Oh well, at least we got it for 50% off!"}
{"text":"This place is so overpriced it isn't funny! The food is sub par, the Rainforest noises are too loud. There are kids running all over the place and the service sucked!"}
{"text":"One of the worst dining experiences my family has had in a while. Mediocre food, long wait for food after ordering (35+ minutes, and we arrived when the restaurant was nearly empty). Both adult orders were incorrect as well. Prices very high even if it was an even halfway decent experience. Our five year old enjoyed the handful of animatronic animals but still got bored."}
{"text":"Its a great place to take the kids, as the environment is very stimulating.  Although I was not too impressed with the selection of foods on the menu.  The seasoning of the food was \"exotic\", lots of lime and citrus-e- taste ( i guess that would be appropriate given the \"rain forest\" name ).  It has became a place for my family to go and enjoy a dessert and watch the animal show and the aquariums.  Beware of the enticing gift shop."}
{"text":"Not the greatest - food was extremely mediocre for the price - things take a very long time. Our server and the manager were very kind so I added a star for that. Just would never eat here if I could help it.  Ive had better Mahi from Costco in the frozen fish. The shrimp was worthy of a fast food place. Everything was cold. Only other highlight was my 7 year old loved the decor"}
{"text":"Wow...bad food and way overpriced.  Will never be coming back. Got a burger....figured that was a sure thing.  Not. Would have rather had a burger at McDonald's. Charged my 12 year daughter $3.29 for a drink and $15 for my untasty burger. Yikes! Slow service too."}
{"text":"The food was average. My meal looked and tasted like something I could get at my work's cafe. The apple sauce that came with my daughters meal looked like it came out of her lunchable."}
{"text":"Hm.. one time visit would be enough to enjoy their decorations of forest and animal toys. The food was so impressive. The meat of steak was too chewy, low quality which disappointed me and the pasta was not tasty either. You might be able to find 15% off coupon from some local advertising magazines."}
{"text":"Rainforest Cafe is unlike any other dining experience that I have ever had. It is a fun place to go when you are looking for an exciting night out, especially with families. Personally, most of the menu doesn't interest me but their hamburgers are really pretty awesome. Wish they had more locations in AZ. Their location in Anaheim at Downtown Disney is way better of course :)"}
{"text":"Sadly, this review doesn't address the food.....because we never made it far enough to try it. My wife, toddler, and I came in early afternoon on a Tuesday. There appeared to be ample staffing and plenty of seating, yet we waited in a line to be seated for a good 15-20 minutes. That should've been our signal to leave the Rainforest. Once given a table and menus, we then waited another 20 minutes.....no wait staff came by....not for water, not to greet us....nothing. Our 2 year old had reached her statute of limitations and we bailed. 

Advice to management....when you have a pricey menu, and a niche atmosphere that caters to impatience kids (and parents), you better be sharp with the service experience. Shame on the manager for not being more observant and holding his staff to a higher standard."}
{"text":"Bad service. It took 1 hour for our food to arrive and we just ordered for 2. Good thing we bought food from Auntie Anne's that we can eat while waiting. :)"}
{"text":"I have been to the Rainforest Cafe quite a few times and also in Florida.  The food was always pretty good, a bit pricey but good.  The atmosphere is very noisy, but thats a given.  Very kid friendly.  My husband, 10 month old and myself went there yesterday and our food really wasn't that great.  We were greeted nicely and seated pretty quickly, however, we waited for some time before we were finally approached by our server and asked what we wanted to drink. We started with the chili con queso dip and it wasn't anything special, it was good, but it could have used some sprucing up on the flavor. I ordered my little one the pasta with marinara and applesauce and my husband and I ordered the chicken marinara. We waited a long time for our food!  First of all let me say the portion for the child pasta was huge!!! Even for an older child!!! I could have eaten it myself and been full!!  The pasta was cooked al dente, which honestly I didn't expect, most places over cook the pasta which is good for my daughter as she doesn't have any back teeth yet.  I gave her two very small bites then had to return it for a grilled cheese because she kept gagging on the pieces since she couldn't chew them with the pasta being to al dente.  The waitress accommodated and even took the pasta off the check, yay!!   The grilled cheese took forever to come out, I was questioning how long does it take to make a grilled cheese, be it was good, I tried it myself ;)  Our food was ok.  The chicken was cooked perfectly but had way to much cheese melted on top for my liking.  There were two chicken breasts on the plate, pretty good size, for sure over the recommended daily protein intake.  There was a small portion of pasta also.  The sauce was kinda blah, tasted a little like jarred sauce and pretty garlicky..and thats saying something because I love garlic!!  Our bill was $70.00 with tip and all we ordered were our meals, two drinks, the appetizer and kids meal!!! Way too pricey for low to mediocre food.  My daughter really seemed to enjoy the atmosphere and loved the opportunity to be loud, but I don't think we will be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Now, let me start off by saying that I love Rainforest Cafe. I've been to the one in Anaheim & Ontario and I've always had exceptional service. Just the other day, I went for my 21st in Anaheim and it was amazing.

This location however - horrific. We were seated fairly quickly because nobody was there and that was the end of something that could have been great. It was about 8 when we went and it felt as if it was 90 degrees inside. I ordered a drink, and they put way too much mint in it I was literally drinking mint with every sip. Server took it back and I just asked for water. Server, don't remember his name, he was very quiet and didn't give us the service I've been given at other locations. He didn't check on us after serving the food. 

The food, salty. I got the chicken fried chicken as I always do, and it was just so salty. My boyfriend got some seafood and it immediately made him run to the restroom. My boyfriend also knocked down his drink by accident and I told another server, since mine was nowhere to find, and it took them literally 20 minutes to help us wipe it down. 

Never again, very disappointed."}
{"text":"The Cobb salad had brown lettuce and was tasteless. The chicken was tender but entirely tasteless. The Salmon was overcooked and tasted like it was cooked from frozen. The brown rice it came with was undercooked and had dried pieces of rice in it. At least the waiter told some funny jokes."}
{"text":"way overpriced and super slow!!!!!!! we will never return!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! save your money and don't go!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The animatronic animals were great to see, they really add to the rainforest feel. I had the hickory BBQ chicken and it was fantastic. Service was friendly but a bit slow, but it was lunchtime so it's understandable. I highly recommend anyone, especially those with children, check this place out"}
{"text":"Rainforest Cafe is a dream for kids and adults alike! The store outside the dining area is full of cool toys and stuffed animals and the aquarium pillar is absolutely stunning. The bar is incredible as well! Seeing the fish swim around is fascinating (as well as a good distraction for the children). If you're willing to lay down some serious money, this place is great."}
{"text":"5stars only because of Jimmy. A dinner and.a.show. He is an incredibly funny waiter. You have to.ask for Jimmy.
He made us comeback. Kids had a blast with all the trivia he had for them."}
{"text":"Ray helped us navigate the menu and specials.  The atmosphere was definitely a Rainforest.  The food prices were comparable to Las Vegas, but the portions were large and filling.  Great dining experience, food, and service."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were sat down promptly and had our drink orders taken. 
Once we placed our food order (I had BBq burger...Well done, she had shrimp with veggies) 
We got our food about 45 minutes after ordering with no apology from the waitress. The food tasted like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for the whole time or in a microwave.  My burger which was supposed to be well done was rare. (Complained got no response from anyone) my girlfriends veggies were still frozen together. (Complained again with no response from our server.. other than I can have them make you new ones for an extra charge.) 
Little bit of a bad experience when I asked for my check a bus boy dropped a hot plate which crashed against the back of my chair. And without an apology or recognizing he just went about his way while my back is covered in sauce and im sitting on broken plates and knives all over the floor. 

I mean maybe it was my day to have something bad but I know during a lunch rush things like this should be handled better. 
Hense why I didnt tip the waitress. 

Will never be going back to that restaurant or any other chains the company owns."}
{"text":"We had a great costumer service, we had a nice view and great drinks ,we enjoyed,about the food I think they need to work on that."}
{"text":"Service was great. Food is crap. I'm pretty sure everything is taken out of the freezer and cooked in the microwave."}
{"text":"Expensive. This place is ridiculously expensive. Horrible. There are more spoiled little kids running around then chuckee cheese, service was not good and took forever on a slow afternoon. Food was seriously lacking flavor. They don't have prices marked for their booze so I ordered a beer that came to be in a 12oz bottle and was charged $5. The only good thing about this place is the decor, if they replaces all the prices, ingridients, service, and spoiled kids it might be ok. But if you go here with a 2 person party and get the cheapest burgers on the menu, you are basically paying almost $50 to stare at fish and robotic elephants. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE. I regret everything about this place."}
{"text":"Had to wait 30+ minutes because kitchen was behind and they slowed down seating people. Asked for 2 separate bills but everything was on 1 bill.  Server never mentioned AARP discount.  Was told it would take 30+ min.  to get food and thankfully only took 20 min.  Children's popcorn shrimp and other food was ok which made  experience better and server did come back several times to see if we needed anything.  Prices are a little high.  It isn't winter visitor time yet so kitchen will need to Improve turn around times.  Have only been there twice in several years and probably will be several more years before next visit."}
{"text":"Park at the cosmo and walk across the bridge to get here. 3 stars cause the food isn't that great but kids will enjoy themselves!"}
{"text":"The experience here could have been better. First of all we were waiting in line for 40 min, but there were plenty of seating. Second, when we got seated we were right by the restrooms and away from most of the nice rainforest views. Even though there were many open spots. The food was great and our waiter was kind, but she was trying to rush us out. She never refilled our drinks and gave us our receipt without asking if we wanted dessert. Then when we asked for dessert she brought it to us in a to go box. That was just rude, who wants to take ice cream home especially when you live 40 minutes away?? I want to bring my young siblings here but starting to reconsider due to the poor service."}
{"text":"It's a hit or a miss. I personally like the atmosphere this place has to offer: automatronic gorillas (with sound effects), simulated thunderstorms, large aquariums with tropical fish in them, indoor water fountain, and decorated ceiling to simulate stars. This business has definitely spent a lot of time and money on the decor and mood of the place. Don't forget to bring a camera!

The target audience is mainly for kids, but I go here now and then with my friends. With that said, if you don't like kids (or eat around them), this isn't the place for you.

Aside from the great decor and mood it sets, the other best thing this restaurant has to offer is their chocolate volcano cake. It's a dessert served to you with the waiter/waitress yelling out, \"volcano,\" stretching out each syllable until the dessert reaches your table. There's a sparkler on top (again, don't forget to bring your camera!), which is removed by the waiter/waitress when it's completely used up. The dessert itself has 3 large elongated pieces of brownie forming a \"tent\" with chocolate syrup running down the sides. In that \"tent\" has some scoops of vanilla ice cream. On top of that \"tent\" is whipped cream.  This dessert is good to share between 3-5 adults.

I hardly ever buy drinks whenever I eat out so I can't comment on that.

I've had their burgers, fries, and some seafood (like salmon and shrimp). They're ok. Not bad, but also not the best. I find this place a bit pricey, but keep in mind that you're not just paying for the food you eat, but also the decoration around you! 

It's a fun restaurant!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Great food, but even a greater atmosphere. Cool view if sitting outside but the inside is especially awesome with the jungle feel."}
{"text":"Had never been to one of these restaurants...was not disappointed. We went because we had received $10 off coupon but I'm glad we did. Probably the best spinach dip I've ever had. Not to mention the decore was incredible.  Our waiter was also amazing very friendly..and not bad to look at either ;)"}
{"text":"I've only been to one Rainforest Café before and it was amazing (food, service, special effects, etc). I had hoped I could repeat the experience and  chose this restaurant for dinner with my mother. 

We both had the guac burger and unfortunately, it made me very sick. Usually you can't go wrong with a burger and fries at a place like this, but oh boy, yes you can. Unacceptable and something that makes me lose trust in a restaurant.
On top of that, the service was extremely slow. I know I won't be coming back and can only tell you: don't go!"}
{"text":"Everyone was very sweet. I came alone and often get overlooked, not so here. Amber kept checking in with me even though I could see she slammed! And the hottest as well! Let's just admit you are not coming the this place for the food. But the experience and staff are awesome!"}
{"text":"We love the atmosphere of the Rainforest Cafe, and sometimes the food is quite good, but not this time.  

The appetiser platter was good, but the steak my wife ordered was tough, the coconut shrimp just didn't taste right, and in the end, even though we shared the appetizer plate and I had a salad (and no alcohol) it came to over $80."}
{"text":"I really liked the atmosphere especially for kids! The food was actually really good! I got the spinach app and a salad! I do agree with everyone else on yelp the service was lacking it was super slow!"}
{"text":"Great place for kids!   We took my kids to a movie at the Arizona Mills Harkins and they decided they wanted dinner here afterward. They had never been here before so we thought it would be fun. 
The atmosphere for kids is incredible. There are so many things to look at and keep them busy. We even got a seat next to one of the saltwater tanks which was amazing!
The food is a bit pricey for the quality, but not bad. Remember you are paying for the atmosphere. 
Both the kids really enjoyed their meals and had a great time!"}
{"text":"My wife got a kick out of this place when she visited Phoenix for a debate trip in high school and thought we should try it while we were in town. The lobster dip was great and the wife liked her steak and potatoes just fine. My chicken & broccoli alfredo was great with an earthy taste added by the walnut pesto. 
All in all, a good meal. The atmosphere is a bit loud, but fun. And you can always sit at the bar if you're not in the mood for the noise. I appreciated the spectacle of the whole place, particularly the large aquariums scattered throughout the restaurant."}
{"text":"Bad customer service, after waiting for about 20 minutes server came to remove silverware, when we asked if we could get drinks server/waitress acted suprise because we didn't have a waitress. It took about another 10 minutes before we got our drinks, the water tasted worse than hose water; and half an hour for our food to come. Food was okay however overpriced for the taste. In addition to bad customer service  the restrooms were complety discusting. Completely dissatisfied!"}
{"text":"Went with my sister, son and niece on Wednesday for dinner. We loved the atmosphere! Kids meals are only $2.99 on Wednesday's, so we didn't get a huge bill. My sister and I stuck with waters, ordered burgers and we had a $5 off coupon. So we got a pretty good deal! If I would have had to pay full price for everything, it wouldn't be worth it in my opinion. Service was leaning towards the bad side. They were definitely short staffed that day. Food was good but nothing to rave about. Great for kids and adults!"}
{"text":"Waiting time 20 min even though it wasn't busy. 
Food overpriced. Chicken nuggets for kids disgusting. 
Philly Cheesesteake below average . Food on cold/warm side . Definitely not hot. Interior decoration very cool, staff friendly"}
{"text":"We took the kids and great-grandma to the Rainforest Cafe after the Arizona Sea Life Aquarium.

The restaurant is fantastically decorated and has a great gift shop. We signed up for the Safari Club card, it cost $10.00 for lifetime membership and we saved that on the gift shop and our meal, then we'll get a $10.00 gift certificate to use on our next visit.

The food was just average, nothing to write home about, but the decor was worth it!  The kids and I really enjoyed the animatronic animals, the inside rain, waterfall and lightning strikes and thunder.   Our services was average.  It was really nice that grandma's wheel chair fit nicely under the table and was comfortable. We really enjoyed the total experience."}
{"text":"I was so surprised when I saw that the old location shut down, but I have to admit that the new locations has its perks. Don't expect cheap food when visiting any rainforest cafe- you pay for the entire experience! the food was good, but the overall dining experience was amazing. Our server  (his name is Alex ) was very professional and friendly, but what stood out the most were the AMAZING views over the strip from the outside patio!"}
{"text":"This atmosphere is great. The dake rain huge fish tanks woldlife all around. Really beautiful. Service is a little slow cause its always busy. Great place to take the kids though. There smoothie I had was good. There food is fecent a little pricy for the quality of food but still a fun place to go."}
{"text":"Chicken fried chicken almost gave me a stroke because it was so salty. Bad service and poor management."}
{"text":"To be fair, I would rank food and speed of service at 3 stars. However, one of the children in our family has multiple food allergies, and they did a really great job ensuring that they were taken care of."}
{"text":"This place is one of the worst chains.

I've been to the one in Downtown Disney and my biggest complaint there was the service staff.
Against my better judgement, I chose to give the company a second chance and went to the one in Las Vegas for a celebration dinner.

Absolutely HORRIBLE.
The service was slower than a snail.
I mean there were no more than 4 tables in this place (and mind you this was around dinner time) and our server was hardly ever around. We hardly saw any service staff.
She took way too long to greet us, so we ordered waters and decided to go downstairs for the cheap margaritas across the hall. No one told us we couldn't bring them back in. (Not that there was anyone around) Once we got our waters. She walked away before we could order appetizers. Even that took 25+ mins for them to arrive.
Towards the end of our meals our server announced a different server was taking over the table.
When this guys brought the check, things were on the wrong tabs.
It was a mess.
I don't think anyone in my group was impressed.

The slow, terrible service and the lack of wow of the food...
I will NOT be returning.
You can't make me."}
{"text":"So, I remember visiting the rainforest cafe as a youngster, and I can tell you, the thunder storms seemed to scare me a bit. Going back as an adult made me fully appreciate the uniqueness of the restaurant. I enjoyed (even more) the thunder storm, moving animals and i especially loved the aquarium and star gazing section. The reason for not giving a full 5 stars after such a fun time was the absurd prices for most of the food, I understand your paying for an environment, but really? 

Either way, it also has a nice bar to rest at."}
{"text":"This was much more than a restaurant. This was one visual stimulation after another.  Each time you be ready to look on, some type of noise would intrigue you to see What's Next. Elephants, Monkeys & Fish; Oh My. The service was feiendky and informative. The food was an 8. All in all, I'm definately coming back."}
{"text":"So so order the appetizer platter chicken strips came out under cooked everything else was OK sent out new ones as a replacement? Overall ok overpriced for ambiance"}
{"text":"There is nothing special about this place.  I only ate here because I didn't have plans and was tired of walking around and it was close.  I'd call it chain food garbage generic burgers sandwiches and pizza.  Ok cool they got some waterfalls and animatronic wildlife.  Maybe it's great for kids but I don't bring my kids to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"So this is probably one of the worst cafes out there. All Spanish music the whole time. Poor food. Sorry very poor food. Don't put a piping hot plate in front of my toddler. Ask the parents if you are not that bright. My wife almost broke her neck in the bathroom. Why are the floors sunk in a tiled room stall? Cracks in the floors. And allfor the prices that Disney would be sorry about charging you. Poor service ...yes my son is STILL waiting on milk. 

***Update**
Both my wife and son contracted food poisoning from this place and puked for over 24 hours. Please stay away from this place. This was a horrific experience that we are still going thru. I hope more people read this and the inspectors come out."}
{"text":"Food is good but my friend and I found the place a bit much, too noisy and too many distractions. Great place for families with kids but for us we want something a bit more romantic and quiet."}
{"text":"Horrible food. Expensive. Bad service which is surprising since there's 100 servers milling around. Our order was simple - appetizer platter and side of fries. Fries came out with someone else's order which they tried to give us. They left the fries and 20 minutes later the rest of our order showed up. I hate this place which is too bad because I like the idea of it and the potential. But it always disappoints."}
{"text":"Overpriced food in an amazing atmosphere (if you're imaginatively-inclined). Yes, the animatronic animals are outdated but they're still fun, as is the thunderstorm. I really enjoyed the fountain & statue of Atlas, though I'm not sure what he has to do with the rainforest or its animals. 

The food is nothing special and costs 50% more than anywhere else. Except for their Volcano desert, which is AMAZING. For $16 you get a giant mountain of brownies and ice cream. 

My suggestion is to have dinner in the Yorkdale food court, and go to Rainforest for their Volcano desert."}
{"text":"Food and service was good the drinks had absolutely NO booze in them and at $12.99 & $8.99 that's being a major cheap skate rip-off and we drove 35 miles one way to get screwed on drinks.

I'll also add that I had bought and paid cash for a Rain Forest Café gift card, and Landry's Select Club con place of business  refuses to add points to my membership because I used a gift card that I paid up front for, NOT at a Landry's rip-off restaurant.
They said I would have to buy gift cards from them.
They are nice restaurants, but in reality the food is not all that good, to actually spend as much money as they charge. 
After this I'll never step foot in another Landry's restaurant, its not worth it what the food and drinks costs.

Lots of bad reviews here and what happened to us is just one explanation as to why."}
{"text":"Usually I have a great time here. The service is nice but the kitchen takes foreveeerr on food so it is very inconvenient to come here if you make other plans to attend to for the day. Be prepared to wait 30 minutes to an hour just for an appetizer.  Other then that I still love the food here. :3"}
{"text":"Terrible service! We came in and stood for 10 minutes whilst servers walked by, saw us waiting to be seated but didn't ask if we needed help. Our waitress forgot our niece's drink until we asked for the manager then only checked on us once. Never refilled our drinks and it was a Sunday afternoon and not busy. Horrible place to eat"}
{"text":"Walking down the strip across from the Cosmopolitan and stopped for a quick bite. Had the appetizer sampler with chips and spinach & artichoke dip, chicken tenders, mozzarella sticks, and chimichangas. They were all decent but the spinach dip was the best. Costs was $20 and can be shared if you want something light to eat. They have good atmosphere for kids with a rainforest jungle show where robotic animals animate on occasion while you eat."}
{"text":"We were seated pretty quickly, but it was 8 minutes before our server said hello, even though it appeared he only had two other tables.  When he finally arrived he got our full order (since we had plenty of time already to look at the menu)

Then nothing.  40 minutes later we walked.  We would have been fine waiting that long for food if the server had said a single word to us that entire time, but nothing.  Our kids were super jealous of the other kids that got the paper frog hats.  Even as the manager came and checked on the other two tables our server had he skipped over us.

We finally tracked down the manager to ask if we could get the check for our drinks.  He checked with our waiter, and the hostess told us that we could just leave - not to worry about the drinks.  (She was super nice)

As we were leaving the manager caught up to us and said our food was out if we wanted to stay and he would give us a discount.  We decided to leave anyway because I didn't want him to think that we were putting up a fuss just to get a discounted meal.  

Everybody else looked reasonably happy.  I just didn't really feel like spending $25 a person for terrible service."}
{"text":"we used to love this place,been customers for years. called and made a reservation today, and they neglected to tell us that they changed locations. we valeted at mgm and walked half mile through the casino to find out that they weren't there anymore. thanks for ruining the day."}
{"text":"Worst service ever, said wait was 15 minutes 25 minutes later the bartender helped us and took us upstairs were there was 3/4 empty tables. Another 10 minutes goes by before someone helped us. There on 10 tables people are at and more staff to serve the whole place. Do not come here, you get better service at McDonalds"}
{"text":"Service was good,but food wasn't. It was rushed and the chicken was pretty dry we also had to return the plate because the chicken was burnt. It's a nice place to see the animals and how it's designed and the store but the food was rushed and not so good."}
{"text":"Wait long time and price is so high. I have order meal and drink that cost me 35 and food is cold with bad quality. environment is noisy?"}
{"text":"We had the cutest little waitress, miss little personality as well.  But as sweet and darling as she was, it didn't make up for the food. Grand kids ordered pizza. How can you go wrong with Pizza?  They did. Pasta bad.  All 6 meals were left unfinished. Even the volcanic cake was bad (which was the reason we went)."}
{"text":"This is probably my third time eating here, and it will be my last. Service was less than stellar everytime before this time, but we thought we would give it another shot because the concept of the restaurant out daughter enjoys. We were seated and waited 10 minutes before we were asked about ordering drinks, but it was at this time we also ordered an appetizer for our table. We waited, and waited for our appetizer. We noticed that two tables down from us they received the same appetizer that we had ordered, and it sat on their table for about 10 minutes before the waitress came back and let her know that they did not order the nachos. So back to the kitchen they go, in the meantime, out waitress goes back to check on our apps. About 5 minutes later, out comes a manager with a plate of ice cold nachos, which one has to assume probably came from the other table. We pointed this out to him, he took off to check on getting more, in the meantime we decided to leave. While were gathering our things, our meal showed up, but still no appetizer. No thanks guys, we will go elsewhere! To top or off, they didn't even comp our sodas or apologize for anything. I will never step foot in their again! All of these bad reviews are right on! Poor service and management!! Don't waste your time or money!"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant , superb ambience .. But bad service!! They need more waiters, we literally had to call other waiters to call our waitress .. Was annoying!! .. Food was decent overall !! ; the volcano is a must have desert at the end, but be ready to take half of it home :) ; If you got kids, its a must go place."}
{"text":"I saw all the negative comments and had regretted getting a gift card before I even went. 

But I was pleasantly surprised. We went on a Saturday night and the place was all ours. All the animatronic animals were up and running. I love the jungle decor. I just have one question: Why is there a Art Deco statue of Atlas holding up a neon-lit world in a primal waterfall?? 

Our server was friendly but I did have to flag him down for a refill of my drink. (That's always a sign of attentiveness--whether or not you have to ask for refills.)

I had the Pot Roast ($18) which was rich and savory. The beef melted in my mouth. The stew veggies were tender/crisp. The garlic masked potatoes were comforting. I ate the whole thing. My wife got the Mojo Bones half rack ribs ($17) which fell off the bones and was very flavorful with crisp edges. Both meals were piping hot with not long of a wait. 

Yeah. They were a bit pricey. But you're paying for the atmosphere. Overall good experience and I will come back."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend ate here about a month ago and the service was fantastic! And it actually feels like your in a rainforest! The hosts were also wonderful too! Telling us the names of the animals! I'm not a fan of thunder but thank goodness it's not too loud  over all I would go back a thousand times for the service and food!"}
{"text":"We came up to have dinner since my husband was curious about this place I have visited before in California. We ordered two drinks and I don't know if they forgot to add the alcohol but it tasted like a virgin margarita. I did not bring it up just thought it was probably me. We did enjoy our dinner open till two kids came in next to us by the balcony and started spitting up people next to us I asked him politely to please remove themselves from there and I noticed that they went to a different table ends were speeding down at the people walking I realize that multiple staff walk by them. No one ask them to leave or stop spitting it's disgusting while somebody is trying to have dinner. Honestly those two things kind of ruined my experience at this place."}
{"text":"The Rainforest Cafe has below-average food, small portion sizes, and subpar service, and it is WAY overpriced. My husband and I went for dinner at about 5:15 on a Saturday night. The line of people waiting for seating was very long. I noticed lots of parents and kids waiting to see the hostess for a table in the dining room. In typical \"me first\" fashion, some patrons chose to bypass the line of families by cutting through the bar area and approaching the hostess station from the side. I'm not sure how the hostess didn't realize they had cut the line by going around. But their tactic worked, because the line-cutters did get seated in the dining room before everyone else that was waiting in line. My husband and I decided to go into the bar to ask if the seating in the bar was first-come, first-served (as is often the case). We stood at the bar, hoping to ask the bartender if we could sit there. We stood and waited...and waited...and waited some more. One bartender ignored us as another bartender kept going back and forth to two women because all their credit cards were being denied. Finally, I sat down at a bar table just to rest my feet. At that point, a waiter approached me with menus. I asked if we could sit there and he said yes. I called over my hubby, who was STILL waiting for a bartender to acknowledge him. After perusing the menu, we ordered the tortilla chips and queso sauce for an appetizer. It was over $8. We were served a tiny bowl of Velveeta type stuff on a large plate with a handful of stale tortilla chips. The waiter didn't even give us appetizer plates, so we had to keep pushing the bowl on the plate back and forth across the table so as not to spill the fake cheese. (He did not come back to check on us; otherwise I would've asked for appetizer plates). For dinner, my hubby got a shrimp platter with 3 different types of shrimp. He said the meal was just \"ok\". I got the veggie burger. It, too, was maybe \"ok\". It definitely wasn't worth its $12-$13 price. My husband had a soda and I had ice tea. When the bill came, my hubby looked at it and said,\"oh, wow\". He doesn't usually say anything like that unless he really feels he's overpaying for something. Later I learned that the bill was over $60 when the 15% tip was included! $60!!! We didn't even drink alcohol! That's just too much money to pay for lazy servers and bad food. Skip it!"}
{"text":"The only reason to come here is for the scenery.  It's always nice to sit right next to an aquarium, but it's a little overpriced for food that isn't anything special."}
{"text":"I went there recently with a bunch of kids (3-11) which I was helping babysit for a day.

For me, I'd never go myself or on a date (!) as the food ain't so great..

But for the kids, they had a great time, they liked the food, the balloon dude etc... as well, 99% of the servers were gracious and friendly to the adults and kids.

I've only been there this one time, but I would go back.

My rating is based on the experience the kids had, not me, though I guess indirectly it was good for me as they were entertained and busy doing stuff instead of bothering me (whoops, did I say that out loud!?)"}
{"text":"Decor cool but food quality isn't that high.... Seems a bit expensive for the food but I guess that comes with the territory of a restaurants with a gift shop."}
{"text":"One star for the ambience, food is horrible,service is so slow, too pricey for the food"}
{"text":"AMBIENCE:
Very noisy. Bring ear plugs.  Constant noise in the 80-90 Db range, spiking to 102 Db when the gorillas acted up or rain storm started (Decibel 10th app on iPhone 5).

FOOD:
The food was only OK. Nothing special. The clam chowder was watery & the rest of the food lacked flavor.  Our 7 year old loved this place but did not care for her chicken strips or her Icee that arrived half melted.

SERVICE:
Slow. Glasses of water were not offered & there was a long lag between when my wife's ice tea & our 7 year old's ICEE & my lemonade arrived.

VALUE:
The food was over priced.  Dinner for 3 was $77, this included an appetizer & souvenir cup.

WILL WE REVISIT?
Probably not."}
{"text":"The food was ok, way overpriced but that I can deal with however the service is terrible. We went here as a group to celebrate my sons 16th birthday on a Wednesday night, first they lost our cake that we had delivered and then once found it was served frozen, secondly they forgot one of our party guests order completely and brought it out finally at almost the same time as the brought the cake. It took two hours by the time we had finished our meal as the service was so slow. I would not return."}
{"text":"Really glad we took the kids to the Las Vegas location. Just walking in was fun for them. There's several realistic animated creatures. The dining room has elephants and monkeys that come to
Life. The food was actually good and was a good value. My picky kids liked the chicken Dino's and cheese pizza. We enjoyed the quinoa salad and steak, which we shared and was plenty. Will definitely make it a point to go to any Rainforest Cafe"}
{"text":"I went here with my brother and his family about 5 years ago when I was visiting from Denver. I now live in Phoenix and decided to take my family. The difference was stark. No fish in the fish tanks, half the animals were only partially working, and the fountain smelled of something terrible. It's amazing how quickly a location can go downhill when the owners skimp on proper maintenance. They need to recognize quickly that the sole reason people come to this place is all the things they're cutting in their budgets. If they want to be another Chilis or Applebees then they need to price accordingly. The current prices are extreme given that it is no longer a destination for anything other than food."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is beautiful and of course loud but hey go sit by a real waterfall in a real Rainforest...it is going to be loud. xD

The service is a little slow but from previous experience in the restaurant business I want to guess it is the kitchen. However the servers are very polite and I have noticed that they do work together to help out each other.

 Some of the food is good and some of it needs salt or some type of flavor. I would suggest the chicken salad sandwich, any of the appetizers,  the guacamole burger, and Caribbean coconut shrimp. Oh! They also got a new item on the menu which is really surprising and good, the \"Ozzie Omelet.\" Loved it!

The gift shop is full of cool stuff! I always see new items when I go which is awesome.  There is also an employee always greeting people walking in which is nice but can sometimes be annoying. 

The bathroom is a bit small but still fits the rainforest theme. Sometimes it is really dirty but I do not understand how people leave paper towels on the sink...there is a trash can in the bathroom. 

Overall love this place and it is way better then the one in Vegas! :)"}
{"text":"This place is a very unique and awesome place where you can see animatronic animals.its quite amazing and the people there are very friendly.the only thing holding me back from giving five stars is because the food wasn't very good."}
{"text":"Ok, no more fish aquariums. Expensive food that's so-so. Good service, thanks to Ryan, Summer, and Nicole. Next time ask for booth when RVSP."}
{"text":"Worst service ever, food was hard and not that good, waited forever for my check. The lady only came by my table once. Spoke to the manger he did nothing for us. Food over priced. I will not be going back not worth it"}
{"text":"The food was amazing but  the service  was weak. Plus there were three other tables and it still took an hour to get or food"}
{"text":"Great way to end the day at Arizona Mills, good food at a good price with entertainment for the kids (me too)..lol A must after enjoy a day at the mall!"}
{"text":"Waited at our table for over 15 minutes without being greeted. Got tired of waiting because we were starving. As we were walking out a server said to us \"Oh man I'm so sorry! I didn't even see you guys at my table.\" And that's about all he offered to the situation. So yea... we won't be going back."}
{"text":"The worst service ever!!!! We went after lunch time, so it wasn't busy.  We requested ranch with our order & didn't get it. We requested it again from the food runner, along with extra napkins...nothing!  We finally flagged down the hostess & she reluctantly took care of it. The chef was nice enough to come out & discuss my sister's special dietary request, but still messed up the order. Food was mediocre, but the lack of service is a deal breaker."}
{"text":"Food came out cold...took forever. Gave us new fries but we have been here an hour and a half. Took forever to get refills on drinks."}
{"text":"The food is OUTRAGEOUSLY overpriced.  I was shocked that they charge over $15 for a burger; over $20 for pasta & $30 for meat / fish!! 
The food was tasty but our order was forgotten and tables seated long after us were served first. After waiting 30 minutes we finally asked our server where the food was and after another 10 minutes we were served. 
Three of the five food orders were incorrect; one of them being that the vegetarian was given a hamburger rather than a veggie burger. He sent it back and had to watch the rest of the table eat. We were almost done with our food by the time his veggie burger arrived.  The server told him that the burger would not be charged due to the error. 
The burger was on the bill, we had to speak with a manager to have it taken off. Instead he took off a small percentage, which was less than the cost of the burger. 
Definitely not returning."}
{"text":"Well, unlike many people reviewing this Restaurant/café, my wife and I enjoyed it 200%.  We went there for breakfast, so may be dinner time is different.
The waiter (Randy) was one of the best waiters I have had service my table.
Polite, jovial, attentive.  He constantly checked on how we were, took our orders accurately. The food was excellent and looked like photos on a menu.
Randy even went to another table to remove plates when he saw the people were waiting on their waitress to come back.
So may be, we were lucky and had the perfect server.
The setting and atmosphere is great.  You just want to tale photos and spend more time."}
{"text":"This new location is such a huge disappointment. Gone is the cool fish tank, the bar with the zebra and giraffe stools, the awesome rain effects, the large store, and many of the animals. This space is so much smaller. Many of the animals look worn, and the eyes are falling apart. 
It's also not as easy to get to. You have to walk through most of the mall to get there, go outside and up an escalator, and then go back inside.
The menu has changes as well. The yummy tomato soup is gone. I ordered the flatbread pizza, and it wasn't the wood fired as before. It looked and tasted like a frozen pizza, not even DiGiorno quality. My niece ordered an ice cream sandwich for desert, I think they must have bought a box from Walmart. 
Family of 5 was $154, which I wouldn't have minded because you are paying for the experience. However, nothing about this was special or fun. There wasn't much to walk around and see, the new place is super small. Maybe a third of the size of the previous location.
I'm giving two stars only because the waitress was nice. 
Otherwise I would say skip it."}
{"text":"Just visited the Rainforest Cafe for the first time ever a couple of days ago. We took the family for our granddaughter's 7th birthday celebration as this was her request. I'll admit, after perusing the reviews, I wasn't expecting much. I'll have to admit though .. we all had a great time. Two teenagers (one a vegetarian and one gluten intolerant) were happy to find food choices that met their needs. The chef came to the table and discussed gluten-free options, winning much respect. The service was excellent (shout out to Douglas) and our food was delicious. So what if it isn't a five star experience? The kids loved it and we enjoyed it. We will not hesitate to return!"}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant if you have kids and want to give them a special treat. Steven was our waiter and he was on top of it all. We had the Rueben and one of the wraps. Both were delicious. The food is a bit pricey but I guess you are paying for the animation going on around you. We will go back if we have friends or family visiting with small children. Definitely not a place for a couple looking to enjoy the evening."}
{"text":"The Rainforest cafe is a pretty cool place to go. It has a very interesting and obviously tropical surroundings.  There are jungle plants and animals everywhere and some of them move and make noises. they have a giant tropical fish tank and a huge water fountain too. When you sit down to eat there is a lot to look at and enjoy. The food and drinks are pretty good here too. The prices are a little high but its somewhat understandable for this type of place. Its definitely a place to go if you are on vacation or with the family."}
{"text":"Being the only location in Arizona the Rainforest Cafe at the Arizona Mills Mall automatically earns itself a positive reputation. However, the restaurant's success and appeal are also a result of the restaurant's fun-oriented atmosphere as well as its individuality.

As mentioned earlier, Rainforest Cafe is located at the Arizona Mills Mall in Tempe, a large mall different from other malls in Arizona. There are plenty of things to do here because the mall is home to a Harkins IMAX movie theater and a Gameworks in addition to all of the stores. The assortment of available activities makes the mall a good place to plan an entire day of events. This is exactly what my girlfriend and I did for our one-year anniversary; we started off the day with a meal at the Rainforest Café, strolled around the mall for a while, and then saw a movie at the Harkins. All in all, it proved to be an entertaining day, and the highlight of it was our fun-filled visit to the Rainforest Cafe.

The setting of the Rainforest Cafe is similar to that of an amusement park rather than a regular restaurant, and is the main reason that people choose to visit here. The restaurant was designed to look like a tropical rainforest, and is filled with artificial trees, animatronic animals, and large aquariums filled with live fish. Fake fog and thunderstorms add to the wild vibe, and provide an entertaining environment different from other locales. Because of its similarity to amusement parks such as Disneyland, the Rainforest Cafe is popular among families and teenagers looking to have a good time. As a result, the restaurant is often filled with loud, energetic children, which can be annoying but also adds to the overall mood because their antics are similar to those of the electronic gorillas that periodically cause an uproar in their of the restaurant. Besides, since most of the people dining at the restaurant are there to have a good time, it does little to disturb their visit.

In terms of service, Rainforest Cafe is just average; they often appear rushed and a little confused, which is understandable because the restaurant is always so busy. However, they are always friendly and willing to help, making up for their overwhelmed service.

The only fault of the Rainforest Cafe is the pricing, which is a little excessive considering that the majority of the items are of common quality. But the prices are not so extreme that they take away from the restaurant's appeal because the unique experience offered by this location is worth paying a little extra."}
{"text":"Hmmm, always the same food at every location but the staff here was lagging and if they had been more attentive i would have ordered a volcano for dessert..."}
{"text":"It had been a few years since I was last here but the moment they brought the food in i remembered why I don't come here. The food is bland, the kids are brought food on prison trays (not kidding). It's a sizzlers with forest decor. Service was friendly and prompt. I won't be back (and I'll remember this time)"}
{"text":"What a great time we had. We have been coming to Rainforest Cafe in Las Vegas for 15 years. We always have a good experience this time was no exception. We were treated so good. Seated quickly and Douglas our server was great. We were even allowed to order a dish that is no longer on the menu. It was a dish we love. Thanks to everyone being so nice on Black Friday."}
{"text":"This was a fun atmosphere but the service was extremely slow and the food, mediocre.  With a large party of people--we took out-of-town guests-- and it just felt like we sat and waited and waited for everything. They restaurant was also really quiet so it wasn't due to a crazy time of day or anything."}
{"text":"I was surprised about the quality of food here.  Considering some of the So-so reviews about it, I guessing its one of those hit or miss restaurants.  Shows you how important whos cooking in the kitchen.  The service was pretty good too I thought.  

The only downside would be the noise and price.  Still a nice place to go at least once."}
{"text":"I visited here because of my kids but 
really poor service poor food
please go to Popeyes or Macdonals
Nightmare at Las vagus"}
{"text":"I decided to bring my family here figuring it would be a good place for the kids to be nicely distracted so my husband and I can eat in peace for once. Big mistake....Here I go....First thing that rubbed me wrong....we made it clear we wanted our sour cream with our appetizer....our server forgets the sour cream. He finally realizes and runs to grab it AFTER we had already finished our appetizer where the sour cream was needed. Then the server says he had to go get the sour cream separately as that was the only way he can do it without charging us.  Did he really think we would care about being charged extra for sour cream or was he just saying that because he forgot? We all make mistakes, own up man. Say u forgot, if u did, who cares. That was Strike 1. The  manager comes by and asks us how we were doing ...I say great. We are not one to complain. Whatever no big deal. After a few minutes the runner drops off our burgers and fries and we noticed they didn't have ketchup on the table. Wth. So we patiently waited for our server to return so we can ask for ketchup.....he didn't return and our burger and fries were getting cold so I made my husband walk to their service well and ask for a bottle of ketchup. That was Strike 2. The server finally returns....\"how's everything?\" Great I reply as I think to myself \"It's ok...no big deal let's keep the kids happy and make this a happy family dinner\".  30 minutes pass, we finish our meal and server comes by and yadda yadda ask if we want dessert whatever. No thanks just the check please. As we wait for our check, my 2 year old son chokes on a tortilla chip and started coughing and coughing and then vomits on himself. Sigh. We don't have any napkins so I once again  tell my husband and daughter to run and ask someone for some napkins so I can clean up my son and the mess. While my son sits there in his own puke my husband and daughter comes back empty handed with no napkins as they were told they will send someone out to clean for us. Strike 3. I tell my daughter to just grab the damn napkins off the empty set up tables next to us. I wiped and cleaned up the seats and table and my son. Our bill never came. By this time I'm livid. A porter finally arrived with a huge dish bucket and asked What needed to be cleaned. LMFAO I CLEANED IT UP ALREADY???? We get up to leave, as we weren't going to wait anymore. The server was still MIA with our bill. We go to the front host and ask if they can pull up our bill so we can pay as we were livid and leaving!!! They ask what's wrong ? Who's our server. Yadda yadda. Whatever. The same manager comes out and asks what's wrong...ha! What difference does it make??? I told the manager...how I don't like to complain as I'm in the same industry but this was just plain ridiculous. She made it a point to say she did ask us how we were doing before and I should of said something if I was not happy. Lol!!!!! She asked us the first 15 minutes we were there. She wasn't there for any of the other problems we had. Our server wasn't a bad guy. I'm sure he tried his best. Assuming he was busy was why he couldn't get back to us when he was needed. Ok. If we have to run around and ask for shit....then that's just plain silly. If my kid choked and threw up we shouldn't have to sit and wait for help. We should of immediately been helped. Napkins rags whatever. The server finally met us at the host desk and gave us our bill and we felt bad for him to have to see us angry and talking to a manager. I did thank him for his service but I'm still aggravated I had to wait for him for literally everything. It shouldn't have to be like that and if he has too many tables than he can handle then he needs to let them know as customer service is sacrificed when you can't be there to help us. It was not pretty and I was not happy in the end. We could of just walked out on our bill and no one would of even known. That's the crazy part. I loved the atmosphere and my son was wide eyed amazed at all the animals everywhere and had fun but that was the end of it. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"We found tbis place from a flyer at our resort stay thought we would check it out.  The atmosphere was ok, rainforest and all.  But, with all the help they had, it took way to long to get served, I counted 15 servers, 4 managers and 4 hostice , yet it took 45 minutes to get served. portions were good size, prices were a bit high.  Didn't think it was worth the price.  when it takes 20 minutes to just get a drinks, something is wrong.  wasn't that busy for it to take so long to get served."}
{"text":"It's OK, the \"forest\" is pretty cool and our daughter thought it was cool (for about 10 minutes LOL)  Service is fine, quality of food is decent, prices are OK. Actually the avocado burger was pretty good now that I think of it. Daughter didn't like being served the mac and cheese on a plastic plate, she thought that was pretty bootie. I've been to a Rainforest Cafe probably 3 or 4 times in my life and would be perfectly happy to not go to one again, but having said that I'd go if someone really wanted to go."}
{"text":"THE SERVICE IS HORRIBLE! I've been here an hour and a half and had only the appetizer because when they finally brought my food a minute ago it was cold and tasted horrible. .. (beef lo mein) I made the mistake of bringing my mom on Mother's day now I feel bad cause this place sucks. ... Never again"}
{"text":"Waitresses are horrible, extremely slow and everyone was rude. Kept bumping my wife's chair and head, never said excuse me or sorry.....,took an hour to get 2 burgers. Maybe 4 tables is too hard to keep up with."}
{"text":"I thought the place was pretty cool. There only thing I'll say that they should do is not have the extremely loud thunder and lightning effect with all the animals going crazy all at once happen every minute. Lol The food was very good, the drinks were good, and the staff was very friendly. A little expensive, but very good."}
{"text":"This place was known for three things, high prices, bad service and cool environment. Now they've gotten rid of all the fish tanks that used to surround the restaurant leaving them with only high prices and bad service. We went for my daughter's birthday and waited in line for 45 minutes for a seat, on the way to our table I counted 17 empty tables and all the wait staff just hanging out in the bar area. It was so bad I had to take pictures to prove it. Then they sat us next to the mall entrance where people kept looking at us our whole meal and they would move us to one of the empty tables when my wife asked."}
{"text":"Service was a little slow but the waitress was really nice.  The decor is pretty cool (like the other rainforest cafe's).   Great place for children and family eating.  I have not tried to many menu options to judge the food. But from prior experiences at other locations ( San Diego Zoo and Downtown Disney). Very basic.    After waiting about 10 minutes for my soup and my sons macaroni and cheese kids meal. His food was hot and my soup was almost room temperature.  The waitress brought another bowl which was not as hot as I was hoping but surely hotter than the prior bowl .The soup was tasty.  Over a safe place to eat as far as food items.    I will probably come back to any location with children."}
{"text":"I have been here way too many times but I am officially done giving them chances. So frustrating that this place doesn't step it up! It is pretty much an overpriced bar. They have a large selection of just mediocre bar food. I love the concept and it's tons of fun for kids. But I can't bring myself to go here again because I can't bare the food. They have no healthy options on their kids menu and it's not much better on the regular menu. I consider this place a kid-friendly restaurant due to the atmosphere and concept. But the service is way too slow! The number one thing that I look for when bringing kids out to eat is fast service. It's no secret that kids have no patience for waiting 15+ minutes for a check. And happy kids equal happy customers. Crying and winy kids equal annoyed and unhappy customers. So speed it up at least please!"}
{"text":"Great place for kids. Food was pretty good, service was great. The restaurant features gigantic toy animals that come to life with movements and animal sounds. There is a faux thunderstorm that occurs every 20 minutes or so, that makes the animals go wild and cause a ruckus which kept my 3.5 year old daughter amazed. She was entertained the entire time and ate her whole meal - chicken tenders in dinosaur shapes and broccoli. There is a colorful jungle themed bar for the grownups."}
{"text":"I went here last night with 5 others, and I am sadly disappointed.  5 of us had cold to luke-warm food served.  I ordered the \"Taste of the Islands\" and the \"blackened tilapia\" was not blackened and was room temp.  My mashed potatoes were room temp and not very soft.  The scallops were hot-ish, and the shrimp which came late was not all that hot.  
   The way overpriced menu is apparently for the environment, which is falling apart.  The huge fish tank is now fishless, which also took away from the environment.  

   I would not recommend this place at all.  If you're hungry, go to the food court, you'll get better quality and most likely hot food."}
{"text":"Let me start with the waiter, he was horrible.  We ordered an appetizer and told him to bring it with the kids meals.  The kids food came out 30min before the appetizer and our meal came 30 min after that.  By the time our food came out (2 salads) we were so mad we had lost our appetites and the kids were already restless.  

The food was also bad.  Pre-frozen meat and veggies.  Not worth the price nor time.   Also, another review said the waiters were like convicts they were right.  I wasn't comfortable being served by them.  Will never go back much less take my kids there again.  You are better off going to McDonald's if that's the kind of food you like at least you won't overpay for the previously frozen food."}
{"text":"My friends were visiting from Illinois, and they are big fans of the Rainforest Café. I had never been to one, and they were paying, so off we went.

The Vegas location used to be in the MGM, and now it is hidden away in an offshoot mall near Planet Hollywood. There wasn't much foot traffic, and we got a seat right away.

First off, it reminded me of Denver's Casa Bonita--but not in a good way. Lots of small rooms with fake jungle greenery and mechanical animals blaring away in the background. Too bad there were no waterfalls or cliff divers to take our minds off the food.

I'm not a food snob, but my meal was WAY overcooked. I had the Parilla Yucatan plate off their seasonal menu: bacon-wrapped shrimp, grilled chicken topped with cheese, and mahi mahi topped with mango salsa. The seasoning was great, but the proteins were as tough as burlap. Nowhere near worth the $22 price tag.

My friends ordered mozzarella sticks, a cup of clam chowder, fried shrimp, and the jungle steak and shrimp. They seemed pretty pleased, but the food looked pretty pedestrian to me. And even though we didn't have any alcoholic drinks, the meal was over $100.

They are tourists. It's a tourist trap. And they were happy, so I'm glad for them. But with so many other great restaurants in Vegas, I know I will never be back. And I'll try to steer my other visiting friends away as well--unless they have a hankering for animatronic apes and overpriced food!"}
{"text":"Service is alright, food is nothing special but not gonna lie I love going here every once in a while with my little sister because it is just so unique! The place is decorated like an actual rainforest with fake thunderstorms, big moving animals, and gorgeous fish tanks! Not to mention the fun gift shop! 
So no, I wouldn't go here if I was looking for a high end meal, but yes I go here to spend quality time with my sister (I'd even go here with my boyfriend for a date one night) in a fun, kid friendly enviroment. We love it!"}
{"text":"The staff is great greeters waiter even the manager but the food is bad tasting had four plates and two of the plates with pasta had more veggies than meat one was basically tomatoes and pasta the other looked like veggies and pasta with four shrimps also ordered a steak well done and was red inside i have ate here before and never had an issue this is bs i dont where they went wrong and im very disappointed still waiting on the steak after every one on my table is basically done"}
{"text":"I HATE the new menu. Makes me never want to come back. It's all about the money and that's clearly why they changed and menu."}
{"text":"Having been to the Rainforest Cafe, when it was at the MGM grand in Vegas, I was very excited to eat at this restaurant again with my boyfriend and its new location at the Planet Hollywood hotel and casino, however our dining experience was horrible. We got seated out on the balcony, overlooking the strip and a server came over with whom we ordered our drinks. We then got our drinks 15 minutes later which we tried to remain patient over. Thinking that it was a simple mistake of the staff running behind we then ordered our food and waited nearly an entire hour before getting it. I couldn't believe the wait for our food was so long since it was 9:30 at night and the restaurant was not even busy. During this time that we were waiting multiple servers walked by us without ever asking if we needed refills on the drinks that were brought nearly 40 minutes before. We were both getting really hungry and eventually had to pull a server aside (no one was checking on our table) to ask how much longer it would be. We were informed that someone had dropped a plate of food and therefore we would have to wait longer for it to be remade. I understand mistakes happen but, we weren't even told this until around 40 minutes of waiting. As more time went by we felt like we were, quite frankly, forgotten. With the restaurant not being anywhere close to full this made no sense to us. About 15 minutes later we FINALLY got our food which was cold. It was disappointing to us because we had waited so long for our food and because the entrees at this restaurant are not inexpensive. As soon as our plates were placed on the table the server said, \"okay, enjoy\". This would've been fine but, we hadn't even been brought napkins and silverware. Since we didn't see any server in sight we had to get up and get silverware for ourselves. We had issues then getting our check and to-go boxes. The entire experience was extremely disappointing because I know the Rainforest Cafe is able to deliver good service, from their previous location but, this was anything but good service. I don't think we'll be returning to the Rainforest Cafe anytime soon."}
{"text":"This was honestly the worst dinner I have ever had at a restaurant.  The burgers were not fully cooked and they were greasy and the fries were cold and the The total bill for 3 of us was over $90.  I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Way to expensive for the quality of food.  Pretty sure everything is frozen or pre-cooked and heated as ordered.  First and last time eating at Rainforest Cafe."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is pretty loud. It's a cute little rainforest theme with animatronic elephants and gorillas that periodically come to life. Most kids at the few tables there liked it. My daughter wasn't scared at all until this kid about her age started freaking out at the next table. 

The food is decent for adults. Amazing? No. 

My little one had the kids pizza. It looked like some crappy frozen pizza stuck on a cafeteria plate with broccoli and orange slices. The cheese on the pizza had coagulated into a tepid cardboard like triangle with pepperoni on it. She only liked the steamed broccoli and oranges. -I'm sure they don't try to serve piping hot pizza to kids in the event their parent is irresponsible and the kid burns themselves, but my kiddo doesn't like almost cold pizza

I had a combination plate. It's not pretty like the picture. I was super hungry so I didn't take a picture of it. It looks less appetizing. But, it's not terrible. I liked the bacon wrapped shrimp with jalapeños. Those were pretty delicious. I'd eat that again. There was a white fish topped with mango salsa. I can't remember the type of fish, probably tilapia. It was not really great or worth remembering. The temperature was weird, probably because it was sitting too long before being brought out so the cold mango salsa had time to cool the about 3/4\" thick piece of fish almost all the way through, so it was lukewarm on the part that touched the grill plate. There was also a salsa topped chicken and grilled veggies. I loved the grilled veggies. I'm a huge fan of perfectly seasoned & grilled zucchini. The chicken was cooked well, which is definitely good. I asked for no cheese on the chicken, with which they complied. 

Overall, if it wasn't as expensive, and service was better, I'd be more inclined to go back. It wasn't the worst service ever, but I had time to box up 2 meals and stand up and wait with my kiddo while about 5-7 servers were averting their eyes and dodging my table so no one would feel \"obligated\" to run my card so I could hurry and leave. I think I had to wait about 10 minutes for him to come back and get my card when he could have waited less than 15 seconds for me to put my card in and take the tab. The place was not busy, either. If the tables were full, it would have been different. If you're not in any rush, it's really not a bad place to eat at."}
{"text":"Just went here tonight on my brother's dime, as he wanted to take my kids here for dinner. The kids are finally old enough that the thunderstorm doesn't scare them and the storms are loud enough to drown out their loudness. Our server was great! She had no problem hearing our order or other requests throughout the meal. She even had the kitchen throw in a couple of extra chicken nuggets for the kids meal my youngin's shared (and I didn't even ask her to). Got our money's worth there. 

I do agree the prices are steep, and yes it is a themed restaurant, so if you go here, you should mainly be going for the atmosphere. Cuz that's what they are serving up. The food is good, so really 3 stars for that, but if this place can keep my 3.5yr old and 5.8yr old entertained (which it did) without any meltdowns or fussiness throughout the meal, that makes me happy. The salad I ordered was large enough for me to bring half home for lunch tomorrow.

The fish aquariums kept my youngest mesmerized pretty much through the whole meal. If the host/hostess doesn't ask, request a table by a fish tank if you are going here with kids. 

If you shop only the sale items at the gift shop, there is some cool stuff.

Definitely a different place to go once in a while, but not the sort of place you wanna go too often."}
{"text":"Listen to other yelp customers and STAY AWAY!  We were the forgotten customers at this restaurant.  we waited over 60 minutes in a un-busy restaurant for a salad for one adult  chicken and fries for two children and fish and fries for another adult. after waiting for 45 min i was able to flag down a waiter who wasn't our own.  i told him we had been waiting 45 minutes for simple meal and we had watched 3 groups that came in after us eating there meals.  It was about 15 minutes after this that our food arrived.  leaving me to believe they had forgotten about us.  They sent there \"manager\" (later I found it was not their manager when I talked to the real one downstairs.  This fake manager told me that they did not have enough firers to cook the chicken, fish, and fries at the same time and had to switch oils in between for food allergy reasons and offered to give the two kids an ice cream bar to make up for it.  A 1 year old and a three year old.  The real manager confirmed that I was right and that they had plenty of fryers and also did nothing to make up for our lost time on vacation and food you could buy packaged at the grocery store an throw in the microwave and toss on animal planet for the rain forest experience."}
{"text":"If you don't have kids, there are probably better options. Unless you like animatronic animals around you while you eat.
The food was fine. Just that, fine."}
{"text":"I would say that this place is all about the decor. You come here for the rainforest experience not particularly for the food. I had a sandwich that was zesty and good but dry. We also had a police tower that looked more like a two story house. 

But in terms of the experience I give it a great recommendation. Our \"safari guide\" was fun. And the lightning show every 20minutes was also very entertaining. 

All in all it is a great place for kids and for a very different experience from a traditional restaurant."}
{"text":"Wow, this place has gone super downhill.  Prices have gone up, menu choices decreased and food was poor quality! Service was horrible and it took forever to get food. Management never followed up on the complaint. Used to love going to this restaurant,  various locations, but after this experience, won't be back and will make sure all friends and family know too!"}
{"text":"Definitely paying for the atmosphere at this place. I figured with all of the cool decor the menu would be a little more creative and expansive but I was sorely disappointed. I thought something was up too when we were there on a Saturday afternoon over Memorial weekend and the place was pretty much dead.

The artichoke/spinach dip was pathetic, and actually tasted like they put a lot of pepper (ew!) into it, and the chips were stale. I asked for a medium rare steak, and it came out damn near mooing and running around the plate as well as smelled funny (my son ate most of his as we split the plate before I got to mine so I couldn't send it back). I will say that the ribs were good though. Food quality was NOT worth the price I paid for the food. I paid $2.99 for a LEMONADE! UGH! Lunch for 2 - about $50 out the door tip included.

We got seated next to the large fountain, which at first I though was cool, and then I realized that my son and I could not have a conversation, and I was getting damp from the mist. It is sooooo louuuuddddd in there! If you are looking for somewhere to have a conversation this is NOT it!

Of course I got the usual crappy service after I told the server that we were going to split a plate (restaurant portions are too big,  so we always do this.)

Will not return."}
{"text":"I would give it less if I could.  I have been here once before about 6 or 7 years ago.  At that time I thought I wouldn't be back, it was dirty and smelt weird and the food wasn't good.  Well a long time has passed and we went for a friends birthday.  We ordered apps and waited for a while for those. They where decent not great but decent.  Next comes the food.  The waiter sets the food in front of me and on my plate of chicken parm there is a plastic bag with pasta and sauce in it.  The bag is marked Sunday and it was Wednesday.  I looked at it, laughed a little to myself then pointed it out to the rest of the table. 

We flagged down the waiter and showed him the plate. He took it back grumbled something and walked away with it.  Came back out 2 minutes later with the pasta dumped out of the bag onto my plate.  Being it was my friends birthday I didn't want to complain too much so I ate some of my chicken and didn't touch the pasta (in hind sight I shouldn't have eaten anything).  My husband wasn't happy with what happened and flagged down the waiter on my behalf to ask him how old the pasta was. We wanted to know if it was good until Sunday or was it made on Sunday and are now serving it on Wednesday. The waiter started talking about him being and pharmacy tech or something like that and didn't answer the question.  So my husband asked to talk to the manager.

The Manager comes back to the table about 15 minutes after we asked to talk to him and after everyone else is done eating.  He came up defensive and making excuses about company policy. They make pasta 2 times a week and portion it in little bags add sauce and microwave.  It isn't like I expect to have great fresh food at a place like Rainforest Cafe but pasta 4 days old? It isn't like it is hard to cook or takes a long time.  Needless to say I will never ever go to the restaurant again. I am glad what I did eat didn't make me sick.

After my experience I checked the board of health sight and it is scary!!  http://www.maricopa.gov/envsvc/envwebapp/tabs/results.aspx?navigatedFrom=businessResultsDrillDown&mc_perm_id=51696&business=RAINFOREST%20CAFE&address=5000%20%20%20ARIZONA%20MILLS%20CIR&permitid=SG31025 


Think  twice before going to this place."}
{"text":"UPDATE//Looked at there health inspections and while they are given an A/B rating they consistently have problems with the cooler not being at optimum temperature. It needs to be at 41° or less and most of the time its 45° and up resulting in food not being properly cooled down. That's gross! Health inspector made the manager throw out food that was taking too long to cool. In one report the manager got the cooler to 41° at the end of the inspection. Meaning they purposely keep it higher to save money. At the risk of bad food! Also most of the food is precooked and simply reheated before you eat it. Almost nothing is fresh. Burgers are pre-made meat mixtures that are cooked on a flat top, not an open flame. Pasta is cooked twice a week and portioned into bags. Multiple issues with the proper sanitation not being used. Things are not properly cleaned and sanitized. I'm not sure if they checked this ever again but the dish washer didn't reach 160° until the 3rd run on one report. This place is just barely scraping by. They either need to close or be forced to change. 

I hadn't been here since I was younger. Went with my mom and boyfriend. We waited in the line for 10 min. Wasn't super long and the place was full. We were seated and a few mins later our server came by and asked what we wanted to drink. Very soon after we had our drinks and he took our order. Everything was going great. Then it hit rock bottom.

Server only came by to refill our drinks, once, in a half and hour. Utterly ridiculous. He told us our food would be out soon. Another 10 mins went by. No food. So in total 45 mins and there was no food, people that came in AFTER us got their food and left. Place was almost empty there's no reason for that. We left money on the table for our drinks. There was a bunch of staff members at the front just talking and slacking off. W told one of the girls and she was more concerned with the money we left than the fact we had to leave because we got no food. Honestly that was the last straw.

No point in calling anybody about it because they clearly don't care. I don't want a free meal that I have to wait an hour for. Please please stay away from here."}
{"text":"I came for the first time and it was dead yet the service was slow still . They placed me in a corner where I couldn't easily be helped by my server . The soda cup I had was clearly dirty with a mysterious dark smudge/cake . My waiter was  usually  aloof if I asked for a simple thing .He didn't even give me utensils. The hostess was the only reason I sat down , she was friendly last night even near closing time . I'm disappointed to say the least for my visit ."}
{"text":"I went here for my daughters 3rd birthday. She loved it! The food was very good and reasonably priced considering the atmosphere. I would highly recommend this place for a kids birthday party. I had the pasta bolognese and it was excellent."}
{"text":"I've come here exactly twice, and I can only describe this experience as taking drugs.
The first time was magnificent, but the second time around was pretty much trying to relive the fulfilment of the first time--chasing the dragon--if you will...and I wondered, just what the hell was it about this place I found so fascinating the first time around?

My first visit here was prior to developing a discriminating taste for the epicurean world, a time when I wouldn't give a second of consideration to wearing t-shirts in public.  It must have also been a time where I had more money than I knew what to do with, because the inflated price for the frozen packaged deep-fried goods held no significance in my initial memory.  
I was taken aback by the elaborately tacky...well, I wouldn't call it décor..
Monkeys, gorillas, orangutans, tropical birds, cellophane plants.  Oh, how I wished I was a child so I may appreciate this.  There is also a fish tank with actual tropical fish, some so big it looked like swimming tennis racquets.  
The wait staff here were all dressed like safari guides you would see on a children's animal program on TVO during the 90's. 
Every 15 minutes the entire restaurant would rumble in a make-belief thunderstorm and all the fake animals would vibrate and make the noise of their associated species.  Oh what heaven!
But of course, that was my first visit...and that was all that I could remember.

My second visit was, well..the magic was gone.  I peered down through my nose at the menu and found myself at a state of sheer disbelief.  The only way a sensible person could pay these prices for this food is if their child stared at them with those puppy eyes conjuring great sympathy, or if they were kicking and screaming to no end.  What are the food like you ask?
You know when you're grocery shopping and have completed all your essentials, then you find yourself at the frozen section where all the microwavable food which also can be deep fried are placed?  It sits behind those glass doors with great smugness, it taunts you and your diet.  It knows that you want it, but you shouldn't, and the prices causes you to be even more reluctant about it?  That box of 12 dollar chicken wings, those trays of \"freshly made\" frozen pizza that costs just as much as the restaurant bought ones, and those pre-cooked/pre-seasoned breaded shrimp at 20 dollars a bag?  That is what Rainforest Cafe serves!  And with no apology, they serve it at double the price!
Butterfly shrimp, cheese bread of every kind, chicken wings priced as if they were imported from the French Riveria and flew here via the Concord.  

Wanna impress your kids?  Bring them here by all means.
Don't have kids?  Get a room at the Ritz.
The food is priced just about the same!"}
{"text":"I come to Arizona once a month or once every 2 months and my family and I usually visit places I haven't been. Rainforest Cafe is fun for kids and family. They have 3D moving animals while you eat that will keep the kids entertained. The menu on the other hand was too expensive. For a one year old Mac and cheese, 2 adults meal and one hotdog for a 6 year old; came total of $116 not including tip. Outside they have a little store for you to shop. I would suggest not to go here if you are tight in budget. The food is not good for you to pay $30/plate. I'd rather go to a fancy restaurant and get really really good food for that price."}
{"text":"I actually really like Rainforest Café...or rather, I like the idea of it. It is a place for kids and families. When I have kids, I would force them here to have \"family time.\"

I came here for Valentine's Day and you can't get more romantic than that. Here is where I had my first date with my bf so for that, this place will always be dear to me. But, despite the fake rainforest, I actually find this a fun place to be. Depending where you sit, you could be by the chest-bashing gorilla's, which have seen better times I might add, as one gorilla's chest piece is peeling off. Some children might be freaked out by the Terminator/Gorilla, but, better to teach them there isn't really a monkey in the middle of Yorkdale Mall.

My bf and I had the pleasure to sit right underneath the swinging chimpanzee and the large, butterfly that takes an hour for each wing to flap. I always enjoy the fake thunderstorm, but I really hate it when the place goes all wild with the monkey noises etc... I am sure kids can either be really entertained OR really bored. Like honestly...this rhino is so lame *back to being emo*

Food. I was HUNGRY so I really enjoyed my Amazon Fajitas which comes with both beef and chicken. The beans were really tasty and I devoured the whole thing in no time. My bf had the \"Pastaella\" which was a spaghetti dish with HOT flavouring! We actually mentioned that it was a bit too spicy, but it really was tasty. So! All in all, our food was great, but by no means fancy cuisine. I had two glasses of the Beaujolais and my bf had a Heineken, so for those who HAVE to be here with the kids, you can take comfort in booze.

Many a table had this GINORMOUS Volcano cake the size of a kids head. Every time this cake came out, the waiter-of-the-table would shout HIIIIII HOOOO with candles a blazing and the birthday kid would either look really confused or cry...I can't wait for my kids to experience that!

Great family fun, and lots of photo opportunities! I saw one little boy trying to climb into the mouth of the Crocodile that is right in front of the restaurant as mom was trying to take the picture, I am sure, for this years Christmas card for grandma and grandpa. Action poses are all the rage!"}
{"text":"We came to celebrate Mu granddaughter's 4th birthday. We had a great time, she is growing so fast. 

Small mishap, her mom brought the cake with her. The waiter offered to take it back and put the candles in it and come and sing...well.. he dropped the cake. We knew he did and we were all in a quandary what to do. My granddaughter picked the cake out and was looking forward to having it. So, they came out with a special Rainforest Cafe cake. Well, she was not happy and cried and cried, big huge tears.. oh it was so sad. Her mom and I almost cried too....but they more than made up for it... they took care of the bill and brought her a few gifts. They did a good thing, as it was an accident. Oh and the food was pretty good."}
{"text":"Took my son for a special dinner, and I have to say if he didn't love it so much I would have been pissed off. I had made reservations since it was Valentine's Day and I wasn't sure how busy they were going to be. During the call I requested to sit outside which they said no problem. When we arrived they sat us inside, I asked if it would be a problem to go outside since my 3 year old was asking. The hostess rolled her eyes and told me she guessed that was fine but I'll have to wait a long time for a server. She wasn't joking after almost 15 minutes someone came and took our drink order. The drinks then took another 10 minutes. Once we ordered our food I asked for an app of chips and guacamole. The food took 56 minutes! And the chips never came out by this point we were starving! Our server rarely visited us, took forever to get our refills and was just so nonchalant and mind you the place was empty! At the end of the meal I asked if he minded taking a picture of the two of us. He left for 5 minutes before he came back. By that point another table had offered to take it for us. I'm glad my 3 year old enjoyed it but I was disappointed. Such a big corporation like Landrys should have way better staff! I'm only giving it a star because the atmosphere is way better than the old one at the mgm"}
{"text":"We went around dinner time and there was a wait but they got us seated In less than 10 minutes which was wonderful! Then when we were seated the hostess explained the name of all the animals (yes that's a thing) it's pretty cool atmosphere wise.. I DO NOT RECOMMEND GOING HERE IF YOU HAVE A HISTORY OF EPILEPSY OR SIEZURES HOWEVER there is this storm thing that happens approximately every 30 minutes or so where the lights dim and strobes flash to the sound of thunder (my daughter and I really enjoyed that part) haha really my only complaint is they're kinda pricey... my daughter got spaghetti and I got a steak with rice and potatoes then we both got collector cups and I refilled mine once and it came out to just over $72.. the service was great however and the food was delicious this is definitely a place to go for the experiance but is not a place to go if you want a cheap meal."}
{"text":"Tha atomosphere at the Rainforest is delightful especially for a 7 year old's birthday. But it is pricey.... 2.99 for ice tea or soda.... Sandwhiches average $15...but what I thought was really cheesey was the .99 charge for a birthday cupcake  Really???
Come on.... Definite rip off!!!!!
But for a special occasion it was worth it :)"}
{"text":"The Rainforest Cafe in Denver closed before my kids were born, so when we were in Scottsdale on vacation, I jumped at the chance to take them here.  They are 3 and 1 and their minds were BLOWN.  I was surprised at how empty it was so I want to write them a positive review in hopes that this place doesn't ever close like ours did!  The server was fantastic and was so kind to our kids.  I am docking one star because the food was not super high quality but it was fine.  Really you are there for the ambience and my kids loved it!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool with its crazy jungle theme. My kids really enjoyed the environment and loved the food. I just wish there was a little more variety of food but besides that the whole experience was pretty nice and good food."}
{"text":"I love the Rainforest Cafe. But, this one has a lot to be desired. I wanted the fish but since I don't like coleslaw I asked for veggies. I was told they could not do a substitutuion fro this meal. So, I ordered the double cooked chicken with the rice. What a HORRIBLE meal! The chicken had absolutely no flavor, none. No salt, no pepper. The gravey they give you had some taste but not enough to help. The mashed potatoes were ok, but they needed some flavor. They were, esentially plain potatoes. The rice was the worst! Not cooked well, very under done and the beans were also not cooked well making the dish gummy, BLECH!

I asked the server for a to go box, figuring I would try to make it paletable in my room, then got up to go to the ladies room. When I came back my table had been cleaned! The server looked at me with this look of horror on his face. He ran to get the manager and I explained to her what had happened with this meal. She told me I certainly could have gotten the veggies with the fish and she was sorry for the bad experience. She offered to make me another meal, but there was no way I was going to eat it. She did put the meal on the house, which I appreciated."}
{"text":"Went to lunch with my hubby and his parent while visiting Las Vegas. Food was great they got us right in and had fast service. I had the salmon dish if there's more than one I couldn't tell you which I had but it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Of course, Rain Forest Cafe got my WHOLE family sick! My wife, daughter, mother-in-law, and myself were all ill after eating at the restaurant. We were not together for the entirety of the day and were not together afterwards, we just met to eat at the restaurant. Each of us had the same symptoms (don't want to list them) and we were out for a full 24 hours. We called management and they denied ANY liability, just said too bad, so sad, go away. We escalated the issue and got a letter from corporate explaining that they were not at fault and that we should come back again. What a joke!"}
{"text":"Pros:
Great family atmosphere especially if you have kids.
Food is always good
Service is a plus
The ambiance and play on theme. Pretty cool little joint overall
Good customer service.  I don't go frequently but when I do, the service never fails to deliver

Con
Quite a bit pricey

In a nutshell,  if you don't mind spending more, or for a special occasion night out with your kids, this is the place to be. Definitely not somewhere I can afford to visit regularly myself but I have nothing but good things to say otherwise."}
{"text":"Great place to bring your kids. The moving animals and special effects will keep your kids entranced. The menu has some good choices for adults and a kids menu."}
{"text":"Jayleen is awesome and so is Tyller in the giftshop area.

As far as Rainforest Café goes (this is a chain after all, a Landry's) it's not bad at all. Plenty of plush toys to distract you."}
{"text":"We arrived on Saturday morning for breakfast.  No one downstairs so we took a chance and walked upstairs.  No one to greet us.  We were uncertain whether restaurant was open. Luckily, someone came to hostess station after 5 minutes wait.  Simple breakfast food took over 45 minutes and the restaurant was nearly empty.  Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"probably the only star I gave  is  for the decoration
me and my family went in in my sons birth day after 20 minutes of standing without help we set down and asked for help they said sure and an hour passed no one there and when I spoke to the manager he defend his staff saying they are overwhelmed and you have to white since you set down by your own. by the way they have only two tables with people this day. I will no step a foot in this place as long as they have this manager there"}
{"text":"It's a good place to take kids, they like the atmosphere (kinda fun for adults too). 

The kids food is adequate (they're all about the thunderstorms and animatronic animals anyway. Bottom line is that they love it. 

The adult food is overpriced and for the price some of the worst I've ever had but it's all about the atmosphere and the kids having fun. 

It's a good place to go once or twice a year!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Paella here and it was drenched in oil.  That dish sat in my belly and damn near immobilized me.

My kids like it in there.  My wallet doesn't.  All that stuff they've got going on in there is merely to distract you from the awful food they serve."}
{"text":"I hate even giving this place one star, and only reason to justify it is because MY food was not horribly  bad. I got the pita quesadilla, specifically because it was one of the only items under $12. I do not understand how this restaurant can charge so much for basic meals. $11 for a plain burger, plus $1.30 if you want french fries instead potato chips. $4.50 to add a small side salad, $16 for chicken fried chicken that was more breading than meat (my husband literally had to scrape off about 1/2 of the breading). 

The waitress was kind, but misunderstood my mom (even admitted she misunderstood) about free refills for a drink. My mom asked if it had free refills, she said yes. So my mom got refills, and the bill came out and charged her $6 or $7 per refill. She tried to dispute it, but the manager was completely rude: he was shaking his head \"no\" the whole time she was explaining herself, and he kept saying \"I'm not going to BUY YOU A DRINK\"- as if she was trying to get out of paying for drinks when she really did nothing wrong. He ended up walking away and putting his backs to us after saying he would not give us any discount (off food or drinks- yet it was the waitress' fault). My dad had to literally yell for him to give us his name because he wouldn't respond.  He was extremely rude and unprofessional. I am a manager of a QSR and was APPALLED at his actions. We spent almost $200 on sub par food and he couldn't remove refills due to a waiter's error. 

Additionally, the bathroom was disgusting. No toilet sleeves, paper towels were empty, and there was fecal matter on the toilet I went to use. The floor is caving in inside the stalls, and paper was thrown everywhere. 

Overall: bad food, bad atmosphere unless you're 4-8 years old (way too many crying 1-3 year olds when the lightening and thunder starts up), and rude manager.  Will NEVER come here again."}
{"text":"We will never come back! Your menu says the quesadilla burger has pick which yes I know has jalapenos, usually diced & NO seeds. Your menu does NOT mention this has FULLY SLICED JALEPENOS WITH SEEDS in the quesadilla burger and I got very sick! The waitress offered to bring me something else and then CHARGED ME FOR IT!!!! TERRIBLE SERVICE AND MENU WAS NOT CORRECT. U NEED TO WARN PEOPLE WHEN IT HAS SOMETHING SUCH AS JALEPENOS (WITH SEEDS) IN IT!!!!!! manager was not notified nor did she stop. She just walked by numerous times. At least do not charge me again for your mistake. i got very sick and luckily had my medicine on me or else it couldve been terribly worse! I am appauled!"}
{"text":"As expensive as this place is, the food was mediocre.  2 stars on the food, 3 stars for the service.  

I got the Rainforest Burger with cheese and it was something that I could make and I have never made a burger in my life.  Flimsy on the fries, too.  Hubby got the turkey wrap with tomato basil soup.  The soup tasted like marinara sauce and the hubby said he was glad the waiter got his order wrong by only giving him half the turkey wrap.  He's usually easy to please.  My daughter barely had 2 bites of her mac/cheese.  Frame of reference: she devours the mac/cheese at Paradise Bakery

On the up side my daughter was entertained with all the sights and sounds.  The decor and ambience is fun for kids.  She really enjoyed the \"experience\" but I don't think we'd ever come here again.  Our meal ended up being $49 but that's with 15% gratuity and two drinks, too.  Pricey for a mediocre meal.

Come here for the ambience but don't expect much from the quality of food.  Meh, I've had better.  I really should've given this place 2 stars but I'm feeling generous today."}
{"text":"When I got there it was very noisy, I couldn't even hear my self think there was to many kids crying and yelling. It was very quick to get a seat but to get a drink it was 5-10 minutes and the food, I  saw other people getting there food before us and they just came here.
This place is horrible worst place I've ever been my pizza ordered with cheese was not cheesy it had no cheese on one slice and it didn't taste like pizza I tried to order desert but they had only one ingredient to make the desert so. I didn't get one also the reason why I came is because my sis wanted to come soo badly. Here is a pic of the chez pizza"}
{"text":"I came to this rainforest cafe with 12 people in total. We made reservations the day before and called the day of the dinner just to re confirm. This is a new location. The old location was inside of the MGM. Now I guess I can say I have been to both. 

Here's the deal. I have been to the old rainforest cafe in Vegas and the locations in Atlantic city,FL and NYC. There all pretty solid. I recommend bringing kids here. The ambiance is truly what you are paying for. The kids will love it. We had no children with our group. Just big children lol. 

The staff was very nice and accommodating. The service did take a bit. But there was a miss hap on our part with the ordering and a few people drank too much at the pool. So there was some confusing moments. Luckily there was a fish tank and one of my friends spent 15 mins starring at the fish. Kinda saved the evening. 

The food is just like chain style food. Chicken dishes burgers. The appetizers are where it is at in my opinion. I just ordered a chicken quesadilla. It was good. The drinks are funky and different a lot of tropical themed drinks. Hence the name lol. I do think the food is good but pricy for what you receive. 

The mistake we made was ordering a lot of drinks here. The drinks were expensive. Between the 12 of us. Food and drinks. It was just over $100 a person. It's not bad. But for $100 a person I would have rather done a pre fix dinner at a staleskhouse or a higher end eatery. And have drinks there. But your really paying for the experience and atmosphere here. 

Overall. This rainforest cafe is nice no complaints really. The food is always consistent. The drinks are a bit pricy. But the new location has a nice view of the strip. I prob will be back"}
{"text":"I was very sick when I went here so I had soup and a smoothie. Everyone seemed to enjoy their food. It was priced as you would expect at a theme restaurant, not insanely expensive, but not cheap. My friend had a good experience at the one in Orlando, but said that the Disney World one was superior in terms of the Rain Forrest animals. I was told beforehand that it was sensory overload so I was sorta disappointed. I think much like the aquarium that it's fun for the kids and that's what counts."}
{"text":"The price was a bit high but the quality of the food was outstanding. The place didn't stand out enough that we'd ever go back (mainly because of how tricky it is to get to its location on the strip)."}
{"text":"Worst service ever and we didn't even get a chance to sit. There was a line out the door and when we asked if they were short staffed because there were so many empty tables the hostesses (4 of them who were standing around doing nothing) basically told us they'll seat us when the server in the rotation is ready and if we didn't like the wait we could leave. Really??? Don't waste your time and money on mediocre food and lousy service!"}
{"text":"My mother and I came here with my two sons on a Thursday around 4:30pm there was only two other tables occupied when we came in. Our waitress was really nice but she sat us at a table that had a puddle of water under one of the seats. She took ours orders about 4:45 and we didn't get our food till 5:30. I got the fried shrimp. There were about 5 little soggy shrimp on French fries and an ounce of coleslaw(more like a little bowl of cabbage almost no sauce). My son got two sad hotdogs two pieces of dried orange slices and mushy watermelon. My mom got a taco salad and the beef wasn't seasoned at all. A total of $54.65 plus the $8 tip we left. Then we went to use the restroom and it was DISGUSTING! I needed to change my youngest on the changing table and it was filthy! I wiped it off with a wipe and it came up almost black with dirt! I had to lay paper towels down because they were out of  protectors. The toilet was nasty! And the floors were just awful!! It looked like a nasty unattended gas station bathroom!! For the money your paying the bathroom should be clean.. I'm assuming the manager and another employee were standing around talking and didn't even acknowledge us. It was a horrible experience."}
{"text":"I usually really enjoy the ambiance of The Rainforest Cafe. This one was pretty boring and the fish tanks had no fish here! So let's move on to the food.... The clam chowder, which was clearly microwaved, salty, and cold was just disgusting! We were all burping it hours after we left and all got a very upset stomach. The main courses were \"ok\" and the sides that came with it were also COLD and disgusting! We also asked for some orange slices for our 11 month old (usually given to us for free, she's a baby!) we were charged $2 for 2 TINY slices.... Should have just brought my usual lil Baggie of oranges to keep her quiet and happy. I mean $2 I could have gotten 2 big FULL oranges for that price! I couldn't believe the prices for the crappy food that was served. I will never come back again and my boyfriend is STILL having stomach problems 24 hours later. Only come here if you would like a good case of food poisoning that'll break your pocket. Save your money for a NICE restaurant with GOOD food. YUCK!"}
{"text":"We had a early breakfast there, which was good.

Placed at the table be wanted, no waiting time.

We ordered our coffee and the food.

Coffee came very fast.

The later served breakfast tasted good, not greasy or artificial. Just good food.

Service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Great place to take the kids. They like looking at all the animals. The shooting stars in the sky were pretty cool too. The service is just sooooo slow. We got here at 4:45 and didn't see our server until after 5. Pretty annoying. Then it took almost 30 min to get our food...on a Tue. It's not busy in here. Fail."}
{"text":"We had a large group of 38 people and Manny and Lawrence did a great job.  The inky reason why its only 4 & not 5 stars is because of the food service.  The filet of Mahi Mahi and 2 crab legs that was placed on my plate was a joke. The Mahi Mahi was bite size no bigger than 2\"x1\" and way over cook. The crab legs were the skinniest and so dried out. Even the shrimps were over cook. The saving grace were our waiters.  Thank you."}
{"text":"I have been to the Rainforest Cafe when they first opened and went back two days ago since my daughter was visiting from out of town.
We knew it wouldn't be reasonably priced but what a sticker shock! $66.00 for three people and no appetizers!
The place has seen better days. Yes, it was noisy with the \"rain\" and the \"animals\". The fish tanks looked nice though.
I eat meatless and had the veggie burger with onion rings, my other half had a cheeseburger and fries, my daughter had \"rasta pasta\".
The Rasta she said had a funny oil film on it, and my daughter thought it was part of the sauce so she mixed it in. She said it tasted funny and kind of rancid.
My burger was ok but was a bit mushy. The cheeseburger was average.
It was all over priced but the bonus from it all is that we all got sick from our meal there! :( 
 I had a \"sour stomach\" (read between the lines) until this afternoon and hubby also. I was the worst of us. My daughter had an upset stomach but didn't get what  we were reeling with.. geez!
As for waiting for water and drink refills we had the same problem as others had at this location.
I was very disappointed and of course we will NEVER be back again. What a shame.
If you go, beware!



It was suggested to me when I first did this review to contact customer relations , which I did,and have yet to hear back from anyone there.  Sad."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. Definitely about the experience not the food. Way overpriced and blah."}
{"text":"Great place to go as a family. Menu prices are a bit high, but you pay for your experience. Tina was our server and she was great. She was very attentive and provided great service. My husband and I ordered the beastly burger and shared it. I would definitely recommend sharing, the burger was huge!!! The burger was salty, but I myself enjoy things on the salty side so it was perfect. Overall, this is a great place to come for special family outings."}
{"text":"They messed up the menu!! Took everything off they use to have! Why fix something if it's not broken?!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible. Service was slow. Then we were told that the kitchen was behind after already waiting 25 minutes for our food. It was 5:00 when we ordered and the restaurant was half full. I would hate to see what the wait is when they had a packed house. Food came after 35 minutes of waiting and was okay. Kids meal was about the only good meal. Chicken/Shrimp combo with steamed broccoli. Nacho were way over done and chicken fried steak was just average. 

The place was pretty dirty as well. Teach in bathroom over flowing. 

Very disappointing. I know these pleases are not here for there food. But should be this bad."}
{"text":"So I read a lot of reviews before we came here and I was a little unsure of our pick. We were a party of 5 at roughly 1:45 in the afternoon on a Tuesday. 

Lets start with the good. Seated quickly by a very polite hostess. We were able to pick our table and got to sit in a section we desired. As the price is assumably for the atmosphere it was decent (would be great of there were fish and not empty tanks). The food was also pretty good, nothing special but not bad by any means. Although I cannot speak to any fish as we avoided it due to the overwhelimg complaints. The portion size was large too and we all left full. We had the lava cake and despite there no longer being a sparkler it was great. The slightly older gentalman who is the manager was very attentive and helpful. Along with serving our food and drinks he was the one who brought all our requests like ketchup etc. There was also a young attractive woman server with dark hair and black earrings running her butt off to serve plates to many, many tables.

Now the bad... My wife's drink arrived after the food. We had to ask for silverware. There is clearly a disconnect between the front and back of house. The chef's/cooks were serving tables during our entire visit. Our waitress was not very attentive and walked past several times without checking in. Many of the servers were simple not doing very much while the manager, hostess, chefs and the one waitress were running the whole time.

Overall it wasn't bad. I will admit the lack of fish is increditablly disappointing. One of the things that is a cornerstone of the brand and it's missing. Assuming you are willing to overlook that and want to have a good time with the kids in the rainforest it should be a good time. Be willing to pay for the experience tho. We had a good time but might not be at the top of our list on the next visit."}
{"text":"Great place for kids! The Cheetah-Rita drink is awesome! Prices are a little high but food is good. Great atmosphere. Took awhile for someone to come take our order.,"}
{"text":"Stay away!!! Overpriced and not worth it. 
Think it's suppose to be fun for kids but every 20 minutes the lights flash and animals wake up and it's loud.   The food was blah. Like I said STAY AWAY."}
{"text":"So after having a fun day at Yorkdale mall I thought I can relive my childhood by coming to rainforest cafe! I was really excited, but then I realized how much I've actually aged. Service was great, our server Calvin was very attentive and efficient. Food was pretty yummy, my burger was practically the size of my head. But then again it ought to be seeing as it's an extremely overpriced burger. I was looking forward to waffle fries which I loved as a kid, but I didn't see it there anymore, so sadsies =( .

However this resto is more of a 2.5 for two reasons: fire hazard and the thunderstorms. There is a dessert called the volcano which involves waiters running with the dessert lit with sparklers, in a place where children are running around everywhere, yelling VOOOOOLLLLCAAANNNOOOO. Again, they are RUNNING WITH FIRE, with kids running everywhere. I was incredibly scared that a kid would knock over a waiter and I would get a sparkler in my hair. Maybe I'm exaggerating a little, but seriously, I still find it dangerous. Then, I don't know what kind of genius decided to have realistic thunderstorms where lights are dimmed and loud thunder roars and the fake animals go crazy. That's like ASKING for kids to go cray cray. Sure many kids aren't afraid of these things, but there were a few that were, and they cried their little hearts out. I thought this place was supposed to be fun?!Whyyyy rainforest? Whyyyyyy?

However I decided to bump this up to a 3 star for a few reasons. 
1) good service
2)The amount of fun my boyfriend and I had discussing how I should write about the fire hazard and thunderstorm in the review.
3) the childhood memories of when I enjoyed this place and got cute plastic cups without worrying about paying the bill.

Overall, if you hate kids, you will hate it here too. If you have kids though, and they aren't afraid of thunder then maybe check it out. Sure there's a fire hazard, but if you or your spouse is a firefighter, then there should be no problem ;)"}
{"text":"Really disappointed. No more fish in the tanks. Google it. Multiple locations impacted. 

Food appears to be frozen. Ordered fish and chips, fish was 80% batter. So much fluff. 

Service from servers are good, but ultimately the lack of quality in their food speaks volumes as to where the organization stands currently in its lifecycle."}
{"text":"The food was great. Huge portions. I had the breakfast pizza. Daughter had the breakfast taco. The waitress Tracey was awesome!"}
{"text":"It is an expensive family restaurant where you pay for the decor. If you want to eat some place and have a decent conversation stay away it is loud and there are kids everywhere."}
{"text":"Ok i would totally give it 5 stars but its not worth 5 stars and i will say why. 1. its way over priced, but the sizes were pretty good for adult servings. 2. i was really on the fence about trying it because of some of the reviews on here and other websites. our server was a tad slow but again we came on a Saturday at lunch time so its a given that it will be busy. the food was good, what i don't understand is why does it take 3-4 people to bring your food out i mean come on whats the point of a waitress if she cant handle a table of 6. the lighting was a wee bit on the dark side. over all its only a one time deal only once a year. what ticks me off is that they have a kids menu but then they turn around and charge you extra for fries, when it states it comes with a choice of your side. same goes for adult meals. i was like WTF really charge 1.50 for a few measles fries, really ticked me off. then at the bottom of the kids menu it says that they can get a water bottle but they don't tell you it cost 8 dollars! good thing i asked about them. i think they really screw people on the price and hide the fact they charge extra for fries or any of that on their menu, because when ordering they then tell you oh that's extra, grrrr, very poor business practice on their part, such a same because it could really be a good place if it wasn't for all the hidden fees and charges on stuff. 3 noise level was moderate to loud, it got loud when the animals were going off and thunder and all that, other then that a dark cramped seating area all the way around, we got seated next to a huge family in more ways then one, and they wouldn't even move an inch so we had to move and pull our tables so our lil kids could sit in the chairs. 4. my daughters \"dino\" shaped nuggets are the same ones i can buy a big bag for the same price i got stiffed with. there were some deals in the gift shop and then even there they try to get you to sign up for their rewards thing, yeah right like I'm going to be back anytime soon. I don't know i didn't have high expcations for the place so im trying not to get overly depressed on the 90 bucks i had to pay for 3 kids and 3 adults..........sigh the things we do for our kids!"}
{"text":"The environment is tight, the food is okay. Just your classic restaurant food nothing special, except the atmosphere."}
{"text":"The Rainforest Cafe Tempe is awesome if you have a school group or birthday party.  I teach special education and visit this location at least once per year.  The staff takes my students around and teaches them about the various animals and locations in the restaurant.    The staff is so amazingly nice and always welcomes my group.  

I typically am not a fan of Rainforest Cafe's because typically the food is just so so and the decor is the same at all the locations but this one is different because of the friendly and passionate staff."}
{"text":"I had never been to Rainforest Cafe and I'm glad that I got to try it because I love trying things at least once; however, this will also be my last time going there. We'll start from the beginning: 

The atmosphere was nice for the \"jungle\" but it was so loud that I could not hear my wife talking to me. I felt that I had to scream at her to talk. Our waitress was nice but didn't check on us often. We barely understood her either because she speak loud enough. We got our drinks (ten mins later) and my iced tea was good but my wife's chocolate shake was gross. Too much chocolate syrup and it was expensive!! We sent it back so she could get water another 10 mins later. Food delivery was quick and my burger was pretty good but it was plain and $12!! Jeez, so expensive for something so plain!!! I got onion rings for an extra few dollars (they were okay but worth the extra few $$$). My wife got an extra plate of fries and they were a few bucks but they didn't give her more than ten! I like the atmosphere of the restaurant and the theme but they are completely over priced!!!! Not worth it at all! The food was mediocre but left me sick that night. 

Not as amazing as I thought it would be after seeing it many times in Vegas..."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this place. Very kid friendly, nice atmosphere and my son loves it here! I have to admit, the food is pretty good."}
{"text":"This has been the worst experience I ever had at the Cafe. Have eaten in California and in Illinois and alway loved the experience until now. I was surprised of the limited menus. The previous available selections were always diverse, and fun to chose from. We had to wait for 15 min even though once we were allowed upstairs there were several tables available. It was dark and poorly lit with light coming in from the patio making it hard to see anything. I ordered the club sandwich and it was very disappointing. The sandwich was ice cold as if it was made in the morning wrapped in cellophane and served ice cold. It wasn't fresh and not worth $16.00. The only bright spot was our server Natalie who was very personable. I would not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a must if you are traveling with kids. No matter what city we are in if they have a rain forest cafe we stop. Very consistent and the kids love the theme. The rain forest entertainment with the periodic storm and animals engaging the diners is definitely worth the price if you have children. They just love it but if I'm dining with adults not sure I would be choosing this location since it caters more to families. Full bar so maybe I would sit up there but probably not because people bring their kids to bar area as well."}
{"text":"Definitely paying for the atmosphere at this place not so much for the food. Fun and cool place for kids. The only food I like here is the giant lava cake. I had Rainforest Cafe at the MGM in Las Vegas and remembered how good it was but food here is overpriced and bland."}
{"text":"I'm giving the store only a one star because I decided to buy a couple of aquatic small fish toys. The lady said they were $14.50. So I bought two. Later I realized they were apiece. Currently I seem the same item being sold in another mall for half that price. I brought those items back. I refuse to pay double the price for anything. I thought it was a total ripoff. If a store who claims to support a cause decides to double the price should be ashamed for ripping people off."}
{"text":"The service by Cory was excellent.. But my burger was less than appetizing.  I asked for medium but received well done and the quality of meat was worse than McDonalds. Shame on you Rain Forrest Cafe.. The cost if the burger was $13. Oh and the nachos were rushed and all of the toppings were on one side.. Who uses processed cheese anymore? Everything was over priced for the quality of food.. I would not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I like places with themes so the jungle was kinda cool... But that poor panther in the entrance had a hard life lol!

Definitely pricier then expected.

 The plating was 'throw everything on the plate and run' style. Food was meh... 

Service was nice but hard to find."}
{"text":"The food actually wasn't as bad as I was expecting it to be. Our waiter Doug was working his super hard to make it a great experience for us. For what it is a family friendly, chain with classic american food in a tourist spot it delivered exactly what was promised."}
{"text":"Very exciting place for everyone to try and experience, but the kids really love it. My little one had a great time. We got there about 5 pm for an early dinner and it was not as crowded as usual. The service was great and the food was once again amazing. I went with a turkey wrap, which was very good. I have tried many things there and everything is always great. If you get a chance TRY the clam chowder.  EXCELLENT!! I would go back just for the soup.  We also ordered the mushroom raviolis, which were also amazing and a must try,  I was upset I was not the one that ordered them. All in all I cannot say one bad thing about Rainforest Cafe. Final portion of the night that basically made our experience over the top was the fact that our waitress continued checking on our meal.  From what the manager told us and I failed to realize because we were having such a good time enjoying the scenery, was that our food was about ten minutes later then it was suppose to be.  The manager came out and apologized without us even knowing why and discounted our meal.  I would have been happy with him just letting us know that it is running a little late, but the over the top service and extra mile effort was fantastic.  I must have caught them on a great day from some of the reviews I have read.  5 stars for sure and a must Yelp!!"}
{"text":"Service was slow. The hostess was odd unwelcomung and a bit confused. Food was average and way over priced. The \"decor\" is in desperate need of dusting."}
{"text":"I am a local but my kids wanted to come for some time.  I finally decided to take them on a Wednesday afternoon.  

Two things: 

The kids LOVeD it and would of given this place a 5 star due to the decor and the lightening theme. 

I hated it. The service sucked.  I had to pull the hostess to find our server after seeing two people after us get served"}
{"text":"I should have read the reviews before going. Our group had a few toddler-aged children with us, and yup, the noise scared them. It is a cool (even though kitschy) set up, and seemed like it would have been a kid-friendly place, but it's probably better for older kids, maybe 5-6ish. So, that's one thing (and not the reason I'm giving one star because, well, I guess I should have known) ... but the food, wow ... now I wasn't expecting spectacular food, but OMG it was awful. My body feels polluted after eating here. The kids' Dino nuggets were the best thing I nibbled on. Hubby's burger tasted like rubber (he said), my coconut shrimp was dipped in batter, rolled in sugar, fried and then rolled in sugar again, and the adult tropical beverage was a joke --- waaaaaay too syrupy sweet and hardly any alcohol."}
{"text":"The youngest of my two kiddos had a birthday with our family it is your day you pick all we do. He chose Rain Forest cafe . So I award 3 stars for ambiance and kid fun factor. That is the only reason for one star. The service not so good, only checked on us 3 times, and looked annoyed. All cafés should be about the food on that note the food was horrible. The bacon BBQ burger was drowning in BBQ sauce, And cool to the touch. There was so much sauce the bread was soggy. 13.99 for a lunch meat filled turkey sandwich slopped with mayo. Kids hot dog again like warm at best and not kosher dare I say bar S? My other son had Mac n cheese again cold temperature. They charged .99 for a birthday cupcake I didn't ask for. Should a 5 year olds one person sized cupcake be free? This place is expensive and not worth half of what they charged, sorry to be harsh...but ugh! Not good."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with the kids, it was pretty slow in the middle of the day, the waitress took FOREVER to greet us at the table and take our drink order. She was nice but didn't seem sincere what so ever! Kind of like a robot. The food then took forever and they don't have very many options at all! The kids pizza was ok, tasted super cheap. My husband and I shared a pasta and appetizer. They were OK. They rarely checked on us I wouldn't eat here again. The decor is really cool but the food is way over priced and wasn't all that great. 1 star for the crappy service and the over priced limited menu"}
{"text":"This was my second visit to this location since their recent relocation. The first visit was about three weeks ago and I left telling my friends that it was the best burger I have had in a long time! I had been raving about it so much that they wanted to try it out tonight! I ordered the exact same thing as I did last time, but it was awful! They forgot the onion ring in the burger, they put the mushrooms that were supposed to be within the burger on the side and the meat had no taste! I wish I would have received that burger on my first visit to save me from having to return. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Me & Babygirls Love this place
Everyone is so Friendly 
We got the strip view

Our new Favorite Place"}
{"text":"Would have been a 1 star but our waitress was super nice. Basically the worst rainforest cafe we've been to. Empty yet still took 20 mins to get seated. Mixed up all my kids orders. My food, ordered last by 15 mins, came out first yet our server said it was all sitting under the warming lights. 

Seriously...consider not coming here. You'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times and have had great experiences each time. The food is fairly good and the service is excellent! The atmosphere is loud and fun; children love it!!! The aquariums are always fun to watch. This is a fun place to go for something out of the ordinary!"}
{"text":"The food was horrible to the point of inedible and be careful bringing little ones here because of the sounds and the rainstorm.  It was also very expensive.  Yuck!"}
{"text":"Well...take the kids...they will love the atmosphere. Do not go expecting any more than 2 star food..it really is not good food at all. The atmosphere is the only attraction..period."}
{"text":"It has been a number of years since I have been to the Rainforest Cafe, but I had really enjoyed my previous visits to 3 different locations (including Tempe). Yesterday, we went for a late lunch. We were seated quickly and had very attentive waitress. However, our main entrees took over 40 minutes to arrive. When it arrived, the pasta with shrimp was lukewarm and tasted old. My cheeseburger looked like the bun was run over or had been some kind of battle. These two entrees with a cheese dip appetizer cost about $60 before tip. Very expensive for disappointing food."}
{"text":"We wanted our 2 kids to have an adventure, so we brought them to the Rainforset Cafe. When we arrived, I went to the loo, and my husband ordered water for all of us. When I got to the table, our waiter came and took our order. I asked for a club soda with lime, ordered a burger without the bun, and asked about the shrimp scampi for a side, because I have a wheat allergy. We also asked for more forks, as our daughter had dropped 2. He got everything down and left. Minutes later, a manager came over and asked about my allergy. I was happy that they took it seriously. He told me there was gluten in the scampi butter. He said they could give me grilled shrimp with melted butter on the side. That sounded good so I went with that. Then, we waited, and waited, and waited. After about 15 min, our waiter came and asked how we were doing. I said fine, but could I please have my club soda. He went and got it and apologized profusely. Then, we waited and waited and waited. It was about a 40 minute wait before our food arrived. We still didn't have any forks. We asked for forks, ketchup, and I asked for my melted butter. He left and returned with forks, ketchup, and a dollop of cold butter in a side dish. I told him it was supposed to be melted but I'd just make do. We also asked for more napkins which never came. Not once were we offered refills on our water or club soda. It was like he didn't even try. It just wasn't worth it. We won't be eating there again."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant I've ever been too. Had breakfast there. Side of fruit had moldy grapes in it. The only thing not disgusting was the oatmeal."}
{"text":"1st time here & had a wonder experience with my 2 toddlers. Our waiter RANDY WAS AMAZING!!! He was super nice & by far made it one of the best experiences with his friendly manner & attentiveness. We did make a reservation as we came in on Christmas for an early dinner. My kids loved the animal decor & enjoyed the chowder."}
{"text":"Andre was an amazing server tonight! He made my mother in laws birthday tonight awesome! Excellent service and food! Thank you so much for looking out for us tonight and making her feel extra special! Awesome experience!!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying the interior design in this cafe is  phenomenal!! They have monkeys hanging from the ceiling, birds \"flying\" above you as you eat, two great elephants that put on a little show every 15-20 minutes! I could keep going! This cafe is truly beautiful, it feels as if you're in an actual rainforest minus the stinky smells. The only downfall to this cafe is that there isn't much options to choose from. Sadly, I am a picky eater! The only thing I could stomach on the menu was the chicken quesadillas,which came out while everyone was in the middle of there dinners. They were quite tasty, very similar to taco bell.I also ordered a blue drink, (I forgot what it was called) this drink was delicious!! If I lived in Vegas I might just stop by just for this drink! In all honesty, the food is definitely over priced. But what do you expect for a cafe on the strip?"}
{"text":"I've have visited this location many times and have always had a great time. Today unfortunately that is not the case. My experience was terrible. After being seated I had to wait 45 minutes for my food, shortly after the person who joined me received there food first before mine. Upon receiving my plate apparently they change the menu during the week. Expecting to get the Planet Earth Pasta, I in fact got spaghetti noodles instead of pasta noodles. The noodles were watery and the marinara sauce was bland. The entire situation is just unfortunate. Well, just thought I would share, perhaps someone else has experienced something similar."}
{"text":"This place sucks so bad. I don't even know why people bother coming here when there's plenty of better choices around it. 

The food here is so over priced for basic American food that I thought I was going die looking at menu. I went for a birthday and they wouldn't let our party sit down until everyone got there. 

Oh god. When it came to ordering that was a disaster. Our server took my order and then walked away? Even when he came back five minutes later, it took him literally 20 minutes to get everyone's order. There was 11 of us...

ONE HOUR AND HALF LATER...

I was the only one that got my sad soggy little island Caesar salad $7. No else got their food yet. Then slowly we got nachos and then that's it! No ones drink even came yet. So the birthday girl complained and their excuse was \"they wanted us to get our appetizers first\". Okay that's a lie. There was only two of us that got appetizers. Also our waters were never filled either! 

Finally one by one, every 5 minutes, the food was finally coming out! I got my chicken tenders $10 and it only came with 3 pieces? The buffalo sauce tasted just like red hot. 

When we got checks, our server just put all 11 checks on the center of the table. Too lazy. 

This place is a tourist trap and I will never step foot into a rainforest cafe ever again."}
{"text":"We bring our kids here about once or twice a year. The food is good, the atmosphere is fun, and the customer service has always been great. We usually just order several appetizers to share and top it off with the famous volcano dessert. I gave it four stars because their new location is not easy to access with nearby parking or valet. The old location on MGM was bigger, but this location seems to be less noisy since you have several different sections of people in the restaurant. Everyone isn't trying to talk over the table next to them."}
{"text":"My family and I took our oldest daughter and two of her friends to eat dinner here for her 18th birthday. The first thing you need to know is that it's hard to find if you've never been here. You can see it from the strip but the closest parking is the Planet Hollywood Parking Garage(free of charge).  You have to make your way through the Miracle Mile Shops to the Las Vegas Blvd exit and then up the escalators to your left. We had reservations, so we were sat almost immediately. The restaurant is set up inside to mimic the rain forest right down to the animatronic animals and the occasional thunder storm.  Our servers name was Hector and his service was exceptional. Our water glasses were never empty and we didn't have to ask for anything. We ordered appetizers when we order our drinks and they arrived with in 10-15 minutes, which was relatively fast due to how busy they were. Our food took another 10-15 minutes to come out. The food was piping hot when it arrived and was cooked to our liking. Hector continued his excellent service. We finish up with the staff singing Happy Birthday to our daughter and brining her a volcano (RECOMMEND. When the bill arrived I wasn't totally shocked. The prices are a little on the high side, but that's what you get on the Las Vegas strip. Check it out for yourself."}
{"text":"Terrible! Service was horrible! The tea taste like they used toilet or dirty sink water! I had to give it back it was that bad. The club sandwich was poorly put together, the lettuce had brown stuff on it. The menu they gave us had tons of stuff that looked good but the waiter said they no longer had any of the items. Yet it's still on the menu. This place has really taken a crumble. Used to be on of my favorites when I went to Phoenix. Can't eat there again. Last few visits have been not good at all."}
{"text":"I took my niece and nephew here for dinner. Thank goodness for places like this, the robot animals and storm that happens every now and then really kept them entertained. The food wasn't amazing, but it was good enough for a theme chain place. They actually have some pretty good drinks for adults too.

The service was a little slow, but I couldn't complain too much since the atmosphere was really keeping the kids happy and fascinated - giving us time to talk and actually eat.  Of course you end up spending money in the gift shop, but I think it really gives kids an experience that they enjoy and they have enough choices on the menu that you don't feel like you are sacrificing too much.

This location is inside the mall, so parking can be a bear if you aren't planning to visit the mall as well as the cafe."}
{"text":"Such a fan of this place. i wish my nephews were here so I could take them -- they would love it. Its a great place for kids. I wish they served breakfast or brunch. I ordered the Cobb Salad and it wasnt the best Ive ever had and probably will not order it again. 
It was an entertaining lunch with the apes making noises, the fish in the tank over looking our table, the elephants and other active animals. Love.
Four stars because the mall of america in MN location rotates so guests can see all of the animals. I know, I know... tough crowd."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere. Great for kids but the food wasn't anything special and was somewhat overpriced. Overall it was an enjoyable meal but more for the environment then the food. The staff was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"The food tastes good but the portions are small and the plates are expensive.

The atmosphere is \"cute\". If you have kids it is hard to guess if they would like it or hate it. (I've seen some kids get excited and others become frightened.)

I've eaten at the Phoenix and Las Vegas locations.  Although I think the Phoenix location is more professional, the staff always seems lost or confused.... honestly, I could take it or leave it."}
{"text":"A Review of the Rainforest Cafe. By Dimitri D.

The first Rainforest Cafe I went to was in Florida when I was about 6 years old so I don't have too many memories about my time spent there. Anyway, I was on vacation in Toronto (very nice city by the way) visiting Niagara Falls and me and my party had talked about going to the Rainforest Cafe sometime during the week. So we waltzed in and the entire outside of the building was a volcano (it actually had real smoke coming out it which was kinda neat). As soon as we walked in I was already very impressed with the layout and design of the restaurant. You can tell a lot of thought and a lot of creativity went into creating the indoor jungle. We were seated right next to a misty fountain with rushing water pouring into the little tub which was very pleasant to the ears. Little aquariums are scattered all around the place. The sound effects can get a little annoying after a while but even still, it's a nice restaurant with a fun environment that brings out everyone's inner youth.
Now that I'm done blabbing about the atmosphere I'll tell you about the food. I had a pretty damn good chicken sandwich there with fries that I thought were tasty. The food's not the BEST you'll ever eat but don't get me wrong, it's still very good. The prices though are insane! $15 for a chicken sandwich that isn't that much bigger all around than a Baconater from Wendy's! But I suppose that they're adding the atmosphere to the price of your meal to. The wait staff there are very friendly which is good. Like James K. said \"it's a good place to go once or twice a year.\""}
{"text":"After both (1) reading some of these negative reviews, and (2) having had our own mediocre experiences in Orlando, we were a bit concerned about taking our kids to the local Rainforest Cafe.  They love the \"experience\", so we went.

I'm pleased to report that the food was above average (including the fish-n-chips, which in my experience is often poorly prepared).  Portions were large, staff friendly, and the experience better than what we had gotten annoyed with in Orlando."}
{"text":"Great time. Our server was Jimmy. He was the most funniest guy ever. He made our time more enjoyable. The food was good. Expensive but what do you expect for the strip? The food kind of took a while but the place was packed. We will return."}
{"text":"Typical Rainforest Cafe experience. There were three small groups ahead of us to be seated and it took 15 minutes to get a table when half the restaurant was open. Waited about 5 minutes for anyone to come by. Ordered and it took half an hour. It's dimly lit and loud. The food is waaaaaay overpriced. Kids meals are $7 and not that big. Fries were lukewarm. Sandwiches would be okay if they were to cost half as much. The jungle thunderstorms and animated animals aren't worth this experience."}
{"text":"Terrible and overpriced!! Had to ask three people for a spoon, ketchup, and nobody came back.  Ordered a chopped salad...halfway through it, sans dressing because it was awful, I realized the chicken that seemed extra soft, had blood thT squished out of it when poked w fork. Told waiter, And his First response was ...let me go ask the chef about this!!! Elbe returned with my bloody chicken salad an place it down in front of me, informing me that he'd seen chicken do that at other restaurants in town, and the chef said it was fine to eat! Ummm WTF kind of morons do they hire???? He even charged us for the thing!!! I complained to manager and handed complaint cArd to him...and said we were not retiring! What a disappointment!"}
{"text":"No, not a fan at all. I gave this place two stars just because it kinda reminded me of going to chuck e cheeses with some of my wonderful childhood memories.. A lot of furry creatures moving around making noises and horrible food. My husband ordered a burger meal, and I ordered some beef wrap. Like someone said below, Apple bee's is a better bet for this type of bar food. This place would be rad if you were a little kid, but I will never eat here again.. 

Oh and the food is way overpriced. The two of us ate with tip for like $40, they charge you extra for their dry french fries 99cents, and a side salad $3.99."}
{"text":"I don't want to post such a bad review, but it was such a horrible experience for our family and would want to spare another ones' troubles  :(

No organization, we were there for over an hour because of a long wait. Water wasn't served. Burger was almost dropped in my lap when finally served. As I was about to take a bite the waiter pulled the meat thermometer out of my burger.

Drink was super watery. Bathrooms were unsanitary.

I felt robbed of $100 after this dining experience"}
{"text":"Well considering our last visit was not so favorable, we have it another shot after Disney on ice.  Again as usual the service was top notch.  All of the wait staff was very kind, prompt with our orders and refills.  

I got the ribs, and my daughter had the children's menu grilled cheese with fruit.  The ribs were pretty good for a chain restaurant, although you could tell they were under a heat lamp for quite sometime.  

But my daughters grilled cheese was not superb.  She enjoyed it, ate it as any 3 year old would devour a grilled cheese. Unfortunately when she pulled it apart the cheese inside was still cold and unmelted.  The bread was toasted to perfection, but no heat made it to the inside.  There was no need to return the grilled cheese since she loved it anyway.

We ended the night with their large chocolate volcano, which naturally was amazing."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE! I've been here once before when the service was not so good but I gave this place the benefit of the doubt. Not going into detail but the horrible service started with us walking up the stairs to the rude hostess to I believe our servers name was Connie! This would be no stars if I didn't have to put at least one. I was there 9/25 around 9-9:30. Ps. My birthday was not acknowledged! P.s.s. I am in the restaurant business I know how this is supposed to go."}
{"text":"Atmosphere and Service was great. I would rate that 5 stars! But food was...eh. I had the beef nachos and they were just okay. I've had better nachos at the bar. My cousin had the salmon and said it had no flavor. My brother had the steak and shrimp and said his steak was dry. I would only return to this place to have a drink because the atmosphere is cool!"}
{"text":"After having visited only the shop portion of the cafe throughout my life, my friends and I finally decided to venture into the restaurant part of the Rainforest Cafe.

It is a super fun environment with the simulated thunderstorms, gorillas, and elephants. Also, the starry sky on the ceiling was very pretty. As the others mentioned, the VOLCANOOOOO dessert can be a hazard, but everyone at the restaurant seemed to really enjoy the theatrics of it all. Our server was also very attentive and friendly.

However the prices... oh, we all agreed that the prices made us cry inside. As much as I love my philly cheesesteaks, I'm not paying 16.99 for one! My friends and I decided to split 3 appetizers in order to ave our wallets whilst filling our bellies. It came up to about 11.50 each before tax + individual drinks. For the amount we had the sampler dish (consisting of amazing artichoke dip, cheese poppers, calamari, burritos, tortilla chips), a pepperoni pizza ($17.99...) and onion rings. I enjoyed my meal.

I'll give this place 4-stars because of the service and the atmosphere. I'm taking away 1 because of the pricing."}
{"text":"Um. Not so much. If you like a kitschy atmosphere and overpriced food that's not so great than maybe this place is for you.  I suppose it's worth visiting at least once just to see the decor, but if you want a quality meal....yeah. No.  I had the Cobb salad which was not a wedge of lettuce, but mixed greens with iceberg. The bacon was bacon bits. I don't recall blue cheese so the amount was minuscule. There was about a whole bottle of balsamic on it.  The egg was crumbled. Anyway, kids would probably like the place....I will say the service was good."}
{"text":"Very slow. Food was just okay. Took forever to do anything. I've never seen anything like it. It's not as good as the one at Disney either."}
{"text":"First time going to any Rainforest cafe, the setting is awesome!! But sadly my experience wasn't so great.. 
I made reservations 24hrs in advance for my party, who ever I spoke to on the phone was a great help and they even took a note saying I was celebrating my mothers birthday.. As we arrived we where greeted by the very happy hostess which was another good start. But when it came to ordering our waiter never gave us his name, took our order and left. He never returned until a good 40 minutes later to get our refills. When he came back he dropped our drinks off and left. He never came to check on us while waiting for our food or came to tell us that the kitchen was behind. We waited a little longer then an hour to get our dinner, that arrived at 8:20. We didn't order appetizers and half of our party where children, so the orders where pretty easy and small. After we got our food we ate and talked. Waited around for the check, assuming the waiter would do a birthday celebration like they did for the other 10 tables being served, he never did. Why ask if I'm celebrating anything if you aren't even going to acknowledge when we are there, why we came in the first place? The manager I happened to speak with after my dinner was extremely apologetic and told me she would have a talk with her employee, she also said that she saw the note on my ticket for a birthday and doesn't understand why he didn't celebrate for us.  I spent over 100$ for dinner and the customer service was the worst I ever had. Another problem I had was with the bussers walking around clueless with plates of food. Not knowing where they were going.  All in all, I would not recommend this to anyone anytime soon, the staffing or training needs to change/improve."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good but the prices are HIGH and it's so loud. Scared my 2 year old every time it started storming (every 15 min or so).  Place is loud in general due to waterfall."}
{"text":"Kids love it here. It's all about the decor. The thunderstorms, the fish tanks, the water fountain its a jungle in here. It's all beautiful. Unfortunately the price does not reflect the food quality. Disappointed the staff do not ask parents to control their kids. Several kids we're running around aimlessly, shouting bumping into our chairs. Takes away from the experience, not to mention someone will get hurt."}
{"text":"I don't know why you'd come here without kids, unless you were just in town for a short period of time and trying to combine shopping and dinner with an old friend before you head back to the airport.  

If you had kids, this would probably be great -- there's plenty to distract them -- animatronic animals and booming thunderstorms and drinks served in blinky rocket glasses.  You could probably even finish your overpriced meal and knock back a drink or two before the critters started actiing up.  You could even purchase a toy at the gift shop on the way in and hope to finish a dessert.  This will only cost you an arm and a leg, standard amusement park pricing.

If you're just 2 ladeez trying to catch up, this is probably not your venue.  There are kids and families all around -- happily, their ruckus won't be too annoying because all you can hear are jungle sounds and thunderstorms.  For a \"save the animals\" themed place, there sure was a lot of meat on the menu.  The only veggie options were cheez sticks or a veggie burger.  I guess I could've gotten the shrimp pasta sans shrimp, but I balked at the $17 price tag.

I did like sitting next to the enormous fish tank and having them peer at the progress of my dinner.  I was just glad I wasn't eating one of their pals.  I don't think I could've handled the bug-eyed gaping."}
{"text":"Loved it here great food great servers and the place. Makes it fun for the kids ,my kids loved there mac n cheese .and i ordered jambalaya it was so good!!4 star will reccomnd this place"}
{"text":"The service here is so slow I'm not hungry any more. I won't be back any time soon. For what they offer I'd rather go eat at a Village Inn
No one even came by to let us know there was a problem."}
{"text":"Went in today with the husband and the kids and it was awesome. I was a little skeptical because of the bad reviews, but I wanted to try something new that the kids could enjoy so we tried it out. The atmosphere was so cool, the staff was extremely friendly, and all our food was awesome. It's not a place we can go to often because it is a bit pricy, but it is defiently a place we will go to when we have a little extra cash and are in need of some family time."}
{"text":"I'm very particular about where I eat and I usually cook most of my meals at home if possible since the majority of family friendly restaurants are just OK.  However, I was pleasantly surprised with the food we ate at Rainforest Cafe yesterday.  I ordered Mac and Cheese for my daughter and was expecting something that came out of a blue box, but no, it was actually homemade pasta and cheese.  It was just like something I would make her at home!  We also ordered foccacia bread (not on the menu but costs .99  for two good sized portions).  It was sooo good.  Again, I was expecting a premade hard piece of bread but this was warm, frehsly baked bread with the right amount of garlic and seasonings to give it flavor.  As an entree a friend and I split the fried shrimp platter.  It was pretty good!  Everything was fried to perfection and didn't taste like it had been cooked in dirty oil (I can't stand when restaurants make fries in dirty oil and you can taste it!  So disgusting!).  An added bonus to the good food was the entertainment for the kids!  I'll definitely be back since my expectations were exceeded at Rainforest Cafe!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good food. My kids love the toys and always seem to buy mood jewelry from the gift shop, and stuffed animals. Great place to take the family!"}
{"text":"What a ripoff and poorly run restaurant. We can forgive the 20 minute wait to force you to shop in the gift shop. Then you can't sit near any animated characters because they are \"slammed\" but we can see plenty of open tables....translation...their staff can't handle a busy restaurant. We wait 45 minutes after ordering 2 salads,1 pasta dish and a child's menu item.  One visit by server in 45 minutes, and that was just to take order and deliver iced tea.  We ask a passing server to alert the manager who says \" sorry...you are welcome to leave.\"  Poorly run restaurant. 65 minutes after we enter and we leave without eating. We won't be back!"}
{"text":"If you are going for the food it is expensive and just ok.  But if going to see the little ones eyes light up and  them enjoy themselves then this is the place.   My granddaughter know this is special and loves it."}
{"text":"Came here last night, our server Jimmy was great and the food was good. We got the clam chowder in a bread bowl and another appetizer for a light late night bite."}
{"text":"The food was average. But not worthy the price. For a kid theme place , the food is too expensive.the service was good."}
{"text":"First off, I want to say that the service we received today was very good. They were fast to seat us and our wait for our food wasn't bad. Our server was fast and competent. It seems that my family liked their food. Now my dish on the other hand, I feel that they could step up the game. From the looks of their prices, a 13.99 plate is your low end if you are not ordering for a child. I had the chicken sandwich. It reminded me of a Domino's sandwich. But I would prefer a Domino's sandwich over this one. I was also hoping they could spice up the fries. Due to my overall experience, I am giving them a kind 4 star due to their service and atmosphere. They also hooked my wife up with a complimentary birthday cupcake. For me personally, their food yesterday was a 3 star at best."}
{"text":"Our experience tonight was great, the kids loved the experience, the food is pricy for what it is, however our service was excellent!  Seating was quick and our server Oscar was wonderful.  He was helpful, patient, kind and quick!! Thanks Oscar!"}
{"text":"The place is nice as it is decorated with interesting fish in fish tanks all over the place. The service here is horrible. The waitresses are rude. The food is nothing special and super expensive. Do not recommend, especially if you have kids that hate waiting 30+ min for their food:/"}
{"text":"Hadn't been to this place since it first opened years ago, but decided to have lunch after a movie with my teens. After an initial sticker shock from the menu prices we decided to get appetizers only.  They were tasty, but still over 30 dollars for food that did not fill us up.  We should have just hit the food court."}
{"text":"We visited on a Tuesday at lunch. The Cafe was mostly empty of customers as well as staff. A party of 11 was ahead of us and the hostess just disappeared. A man came out and took charge after a 20 minute wait and sat the large party. Ours was a party of 7, which for lunch is a bit large, however, this is a destination restaurant and should be able to handle the larger screen parties. We were finally seated after a total wait of 21 minutes. The waitress immediately addresses the table and took drink orders. Our orders were taken and we waited 45 minutes for food. The food was cold, taco shells were impossible to chew,cheese was congealed or melted and cooled several times. The biggest disappointment was the aquariums retrofitted with bubblers instead of fish. The tanks used to be an educational experience for my grandkids. I was able to teach them about water chemisty, natural biological filtration and tank cycling.  I'd say that in the last several years this cafe will no longer be where we entertain our grandchildren."}
{"text":"Great ambience and a fun place to go for young kids. As long as you're not too young. 
Toddlers tend to get freaked out by the fake thunder and lightning. Five year and older really enjoy it. 
Service is good and the food is OK. It is little pricey but considering your paying for the special effects it's understandable."}
{"text":"OK, call me lame, but I actually enjoy this place.  I even go out of my way when I'm at AZ Mills to walk ALL the way around so that I can check it out.  Maybe it gives me just a little bit of that \"over the top\" VegasISH themed whatever (since I'm not popping for a trip to sin city at the present time), but it's certainly a kid friendly atmosphere.  You can't argue that it doesn't have much competition in the Valley of the Sun (and heat and dust).  

So, I've perused the menu and would certainly not go out of my way to eat a meal here based on prior reviews.  I am, however, reviewing it based on my experience with a mid-day cocktail last week which was KILLER.  My partner and I ordered a large (21 ounce) Margarilla which is a frozen Cuervo Gold (I believe) margarita with orange sherbert.  It ROCKED and I had a serious buzz on the way out.  At $10.99 each, it's not cheap, however, the bartender did give us a souvenier glass to take home.  And, I got to sit on a zebra barstool :)"}
{"text":"Oh my this place is no let down. Been to several and so far around the country and this one is in the top two. Appetizers where killer. Some of the best guacamole I have had in a while. Chicken strips real nice. Our meal was off the charts. So love this place. Anyone files bad reviews must either have a personal issue or just don't like great food and great service."}
{"text":"A good place for kids. With very good food. They are a little pricey but you really do get what you pay for. I would say that it is a little loud and the lighting is dim ans the lights do flash at times, so make sure your kid is okay with that. Other than that it's a fun experience."}
{"text":"As far as gluten-free dining, this restaurant was decent.  There was no special menu, but at least the waitress was knowledgable (she was the bartender in the lounge).  I was able to have a decently tasty meal of chicken breast with toppings (although they left off the bacon topping - not sure why).  They also substituted saled and/or fries with very tasty broccoli.  I wasn't overjoyed at this restaurant, but it was fine.  

The service was very quick - we requested a speedy turnaround to get to the airport and they delivered."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is like any other rainforest cafe, always entertaining. The place is super clean, they were even scrubbing the walls when we walked in. 

Service was great and the drinks were good. 

The food left much to be desired; not worth the price."}
{"text":"The server was good but the fish are Gone in the tanks and it's sad !!!! They also don't have the coconut Deseret anymore and the nachos are decent but that's all I recommend . Enjoy the alcohol cuz it's good !!"}
{"text":"Unless you have kids who want to see fake animals, do not go here. 
But be careful, if you eat here be prepared to drop some $$ for some bad quality food.                ~

Not worth it."}
{"text":"Consider the destination on its own. As far as food goes, it's decent. Service about average."}
{"text":"This is really a one star restaurant, but I gave two stars because of the atmosphere. 

On our drive home from Las Vegas, we decided to stop in Tempe and treat our 5 year old to lunch at Rainforest Cafe, thinking he would really enjoy it. (Nope.)

The wait was about thirty minutes to get in. The line was all the way from the restaurant to the front of the store, even though half the tables were empty.

The menu was disappointing. The selection is thoroughly \"meh\" and the prices are astronomical. $14 for a mediocre burger? Imagine my surprise at experiencing sticker shock in Tempe after just coming from Las Vegas, land of overpriced food. I ordered a cheesesteak that turned out to be some hard bread stuffed with an overabundance of lettuce and tomatoes. I guess they were trying to make up for the lack of both cheese and steak. To make matters worse, the wait for our food seemed unreasonably long.

If you're coming here, chances are it's for the atmosphere and not the food. That's good, because the food is not. I've given this place enough chances. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"I knew I didn't want to eat there when my family said they wanted to...
Took forever to get our meal and 2 of us ordered medium rare.  when they came out the were well ,,, told the Mgr and he didnt to a thing about it,,, Fries were cold"}
{"text":"I was unhappy with their location. It is so much less than the former location. All the fun accents are gone . I missed the quirky bar stools and the fish tank.  There is NO Fish tank!!  Food was okay but pricy. Service was slow at best. Won't be back."}
{"text":"We went to Vegas the show and dinner at the rainforest cafe was included.  It was just like the other rainforest cafes I've been to. The monkeys swing and the elephants wiglgle their ears like normal. The food.was a limited menu but had a good selection. The burger and frys were standard but good and the service was good."}
{"text":"Happy Hour Mon-Fri 3-6pm

If you like fruity sweet cocktails this is place for you.  HH specials are $6-$8 apps and $3-$5 drinks.  For me the real deal is getting their specialty cocktails in the souvenir glass and then refills are only $6.  Green Python is my favorite but I've tried them all.  Strawberry Mojito and Blue Nile are also good choices.  I usually tell them to keep the glass.  I have enough at home to open my own gift shop.  This was my first time at the new location in Planet Hollywood.  Bar area is smaller and I was bummed to see that they don't have the animal leg bar stools anymore.  Those were my favorite.  Our bartender was great, always checking on us and refilling our drinks.  We ordered Mozzarella Sticks and Rock Shrimp Tacos.  Nothing amazing but good bar food.  A solid spot for HH if you are in PH."}
{"text":"I always wanted to go here as a kid but it was too expensive for my family, so I've only ever been in the gift shop at a different location. My husband surprised me with a reservation here! It was the best gift! I felt just like a kid again. The manager was at the hostess stand when we got in and they were both lovely and friendly, and because we are Landry's Select the manager really made sure we were taken care of, even stopping by our table to check on us during our meal. Our server (though I can't remember his name I can remember he said he grew up in Mexico) was so nice. We had a great time chatting with him! He was attentive and went the extra mile for us every single time. He didn't bat an eye over my food allergy and even brought the chef out to speak with me about the ingredients in the food. I had the Lomo Saltado (one of their Disney dishes that they have on special right now), which was delicious. I can be picky, so to find something that I will eat every single bite of is rare, but this was so good! And the jungle experience was everything I ever dreamed it would be. The best part is that no one on the staff knew that this was some sort of special event for me (that it was my first time in and I was really excited)-- it just went that well because they were all that good. Thank you all for the best experience, I will absolutely be back the next time we are in town. Everyone deserves to have a dining experience this good. It ticked all the boxes for me!"}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 stars so I rounded up to four. Service was great we were seated fast and server was very attentive. My wife has a food allergy and they were super careful with her food not to allow contamination the food was good kids loved their menu.  I love the mashed potatoes they are the best of any chain restaurants real potatoes not instant.  Yes the rainforest theme is cheesy hey but it's for kids and they enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I am writing this review from the toilet seat in the MGM hotel. I ate at the Rainforest Cafe last night and have had explosive diarrhea ever since. Supposed to drive back to LA today. Prayers please."}
{"text":"Bought dinner and a show. With this package you get a small specialized menu to choose from. My son had the burger, daughter had the chicken quesadilla, I had the Chinese chicken salad. I must say that my kids never eat all their food. They rarely like the food they order, but they both thoroughly enjoyed their meals here. The atmosphere was great, we enjoyed the Rainforest storms that happen randomly, our server Hugo was very attentive, and everything came quickly."}
{"text":"Our waiter was Kieth... Or at least I think that was his name.  The reason I am not sure is because we rarely saw him. We got seated, ordered our drinks and poof gone.  When I finally got his attention, I asked for extra lemon for my ice tea. He came back with 2 pieces... Not sure if that qualifies as extra.  Again poof gone.   We finally ordered our lunch and waited for our food.  Food finally came I sat there with an empty glass.  I had to wave him down AGAIN asked for a refill and a bowl of lemon, thinking I may get more than 2 pieces... Well guess what! I got 3 pieces of lemon.  Not sure if Rain forest cafe is low on lemons, I mean they charge a lot of $$$ for a meal you would think they could afford to spare a few extra pieces.  Any way as I said our waiter was MIA for the whole meal EXCEPT when he was trying to push this Member's Card on us, all of a sudden he became waiter of the year.  We said no and yup you guesses it... GONE!  Over $100 dollars later, if it wasn't for the company the meal would have been a waste of time.  A great place was ruined by 1 crappy employee.  P.S. the restaurant was NOT busy, so that was not a factor of the HORRIBLE service we recieved."}
{"text":"It makes me sad to review this restaurant so low as it used to be one of my favorites when it was at MGM, and I still highly recommend the downtown Disney one. But this was more than a disappointment. The girls at the stand on the first floor were very nice. We were excited and told to go upstairs. Once we arrived the hostess there with really short hair was unbelievably rude. My friend asked if we could sit in a different area, so literally made an annoyed noise and walked away with no answered. returned minutes later and started walking that way so my friend said is that a yes and she said kind of. I couldn't believe her. Then led us to a table with a highchair and when I removed it myself, as we didn't need it, there was so much trash and a fork under and I commented on it and all she did was laugh. After convincing our friends how awesome this place was I was instantly embarrassed. Our server was nice enough. My friend split a drink and he brought a new one, but some of my friends didn't like that he didn't even try to help with the mess just dropped napkins. It just seemed like nobody cared much. Maybe from sitting there he had to stay longer for us but for the most part he was nice, and he also forgot my salad. And the nachos which I usually love, were not very good. Overall it was very disappointing and I'd recommend going somewhere else for dinner!"}
{"text":"Setting obviously why everyone comes here. Food is of theme park quality and price. It was rather empty when we came and still took forever to get our food. Wife is gluten free so they have their chef come out to talk about options. All they do is substitute, no special gluten free noodles or pizza. Wife ended up getting a burger with lettuce wrap, but the lettuce was barely big enough to wrap the burger. Kids loved the animatronics though."}
{"text":"OK so I'm not the type of person that likes to give really poor reviews so this kind of hurts my soul a little bit, but this was one of the worst food experiences I've had since being in Vegas. I would give them less stars but the ambience is totally cool. I love the animals and the thunderstorms it's a really cool place to go unfortunately the food does not match up to the Decour. I had some sort of chicken pesto pasta. Not only did I find a bone in it which I almost choked on everything is overpriced. Jason the manager was very sweet and came out to apologize and take it off my bill as well as offer me something to replace it. After such a bad experience all I asked for was grilled cheese and french fries. Not only did my grilled cheese come out on a child's plate it was burnt and bitter tasting. I didn't even finish the grilled cheese and had to get something to eat after I left the restaurant that my company spent over $150 at!  I would not recommend wasting your time or money Unless you're just going to see the cool animals."}
{"text":"Its fairly cute, however I think its more for a younger crowd.  I image it would be great fun for the 3-10 age group.  Food is typical chain restaurant.  It was a nice place to stop."}
{"text":"I enjoyed a good simple Garden salad here today. My sever was flexible and added some avocado on the side which wasn't part of the dish. That was much appreciated. The Seasonal vegetables I ordered were stir fried squash, zucchini, capsicum and onion - tasted nice with a little Parmesan sprinkled over. I sat on the patio to watch \"The Strip\" below as I ate lunch. It was very pleasant. Inside is very dark, due to the rainforest theme and decor. There's a regular \"rainforest\" show inside which simulates rain in the forest. Nice service here, thank you."}
{"text":"Terrible service, 25 minutes to get our food and we saw our waiter twice. We had to walk to the front to ask for our check."}
{"text":"Super slow! Just in case if u will have Charlie server, better refuse his service & ask for another one..... Brought just drinks in 15 minutes.....I asked for extra plate...... Yes, he brought .... way AFTER I finished meal.... Really? But he immediately brought a bill! He knew he screwed up!!!  I had to edit review ..... He brought a bill , yes without a pen! Had to call near by server for a pen!"}
{"text":"Have to say this place is still good after years of not going! Have a child now so wanted to treat him to something new. Restaurant only had about 12 tables full but our waiter was running around as were the others. That being said we did wait a long time for food but it was great. Mexicana burger was excellent and the service while slow was very nice. They are also great with kids."}
{"text":"The service was GREAT! The food was delicious!
I ordered the eggs Benedict! My husband ordered the Tango French toast! I love there new location"}
{"text":"I love the Rainforest Cafe, we have been to multiple locations and it's been my favorite place since I was young. However, this location was my first bad experience. I was excited because this is one of the newer locations in Las Vegas and I live here. But this has been the worst experience yet. We came in for lunch, it was about 11am. We saw out waitress once to get our drinks, and once to bring us our food. We had to ask someone else for our check cause by that point we thought we were never going to see her again. She was very kind, just not on top of service. Our food took about 40 minutes, and there were only two other people in the whole place. I got Chicken Parmesan, which was just okay. & my boyfriend got a sizzling plater with ribs and some other meat, which he said the ribs were good, however he didn't eat any of the other meat because it was salty. Everyone was kind, but it just wasn't very good service."}
{"text":"Service was horrible. We were sitting down for about 10 min before a waiter even came to ask us for drinks and than when we ordered. Everybody got their food except my mother in law and it was bad enough that it took forever for food to come out. By the time her food came out we were finished. And for the food... It was decent but not worth the price. I don't think we will be coming back"}
{"text":"Its a novelty you pay for here.  The food has never been great but you get that cheap thrill of a dining adventure with your kids.  Service lacks and food is mediocre but somehow its still a good time"}
{"text":"Excellent experience! Today we celebrated our daughter's birthday and were very hesitant in visiting due to the terrible reviews. However, I called and made a reservation and was informed that the wait for food was only about 15 minutes. We ordered the steak and shrimp, pasta Bolognese, kids mac & cheese, and French onion soup. All of the food was excellent and full of flavor! The prices we're reasonable considering the atmosphere and entertainment provided. They also had waiters come to our table and sing happy birthday. We opted in for the \"birthday package\" which was full of great gifts. It included a memorable plate, canteen, binoculars , sunglasses, canopy hat etc. we all had a wonderful time and enjoyed our food it very much. We definitely will be back for another celebration! The team members were very positive and happy and the manager was wonderful! Great job!"}
{"text":"I came to a place like this many ages ago and it felt like it hasn't changed at all. My waitress was friendly and gave great service. I had the shrimp basket with fries and it was decent. The only thing I have issues with are the gift shop items. The gift items they sell are way overpriced and aren't the best quality. Overall, this place is alright but i don't know if I'd come back here again."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE! 
Nothing on the menu under $10. Nothing on the menu worth $3!
Cobb Salad = $12.99 Salad drenched in dressing. A puddle formed at the bottom of the plate. It could have saturated an entire roll of Brawny Paper towels! 
Iced Tea $2.69! WOW.
Wife had Turkey wrap, inedible as well.
Thunder and lightning not fun for kids under 5. 

Overall Review. SUPER overpriced. Horrible food. WIll NEVER go back."}
{"text":"I am basing my rating on how our server and chef accommodated our sons food allergy. Our son is very allergic to peanuts and when we notified our server she had the chef come out and speak directly with us.  The chef pointed out what our son could have and took notes specific to his allergy.  As a parent with a child with an allergy it is very refreshing to have this kind of attention given to his safety.  
It is also a 'fun' spot for kids to attend and entertaining for them.  As for the food quality I rate it slightly above fair, but that is not why you come here."}
{"text":"Our experience this afternoon was so disappointing that I'm going to actually call corporate after I write this review. I've never had bad experiences at the Downtown Disney and Las Vegas locations. This location back in the 90s was actually pretty great.
The start of our experience was great, our server got and drinks and apps out in good time. After we placed our food order things went down hill fast. 
We had been waiting for our food for over an hour and the restaurant didn't have every single table full of people, we were actually surrounded by a bunch of empty tables. When we could finally track down our ever-absent waitress we asked her to cancel our food order and we just wanted to pay the remainder of our bill so that we could go somewhere else. Our request prompted the manager to come over and apologize. I told her we were out for our sister's birthday and wanted to have a good time but we were so disappointed in the wait and lack of service. She offered to take 50% off our bill and still bring us our food but we just wanted the bill so we could leave. I get the bill about 10-15 minutes later and all she took off was the food, no additional discount was on the bill. I was so fed up with the situation I didn't even care .
The prices are insanely high at a place like this but you go for the experience and the fun atmosphere....well I paid a stupid price for some appetizers and a cruddy experience."}
{"text":"First and foremost, for all the people saying this place is \"Great for kids\" and \"Definitely a kid friendly environment\" I have to completely DISAGREE with those statements. 

Everything looks as if it would be kid friendly, the moving animals, the talking tree, pretty fish tanks, shooting star sky, monkeys swinging from trees, etc. NO. NO NO NO NO NO. Do NOT bring your kids here. I don't know how many times i've been here, but every time someone brings their kids here, they let their kids walk around the whole restaurant because their kid can't sit still. I also don't know what the waiters/tresses are thinking putting people with kids next to the aquarium, banging on the glass like that. For the parents who let their kids slam their head against the glass, SHAME ON YOU. Shame shame! 

Also, out of the many kids that do come to this place (let's say we have 10 kids in the restaurant as we speak) at least 2 of them sit there and stare in Awe, when the lightning/thunderstorm goes off, while the other 8 cry their heads off. Sure, loud noises tend to make kids cry, it's a natural reaction. How can we fix this problem? Don't bring kids to this restaurant! Plain and simple. 

However, if you are a couple of love birds, or just want to go somewhere cute with your husband/wife boyfriend/girlfriend, this place is great to go when it's not so crowded. I personally LOVE the atmosphere, and everything about it.

What I don't love is the high prices. As someone else said, how they get away with these prices is beyond me...If my fiance' and I went with just ourselves (2 people) and got 1 meal each and a drink, it would most likely come out to about 40 bucks. Basically, 20 dollars a plate if you want to round it up. 

One time we went, and we ordered an appetizer and it (no joke) took us about an hour to get the appetizer. Our food got cooked before the appetizers were done. This kind of ticked us off, however, the lady was really, really nice and talked to the manager, and he told her to waive the price of the appetizer off the bill. She explained to us and kept apologizing, saying that they had so many people and not enough cooks that day so they were taking it off the bill since we didn't get to eat the appetizer before the meal. We gave her an extra tip for being such a nice lady and doing that. 

Even after me complaining about little bratty children and their \"i just don't care\" parents, I have to say this place is such a wonderful place to go to if you just want to order a drink and enjoy a fake Thunderstorm. I'm sure the waiters and waitresses probably get mad at us, but everytime my fiance, my friend and I visit The Arizona Mills Mall, we have to stop in at the rainforest cafe to order an ice tea, just so we can sit and chat and listen to the thunderstorm. Luckily for us, we usually get seated right under the sky. My favorite part of the whole Restaurant.

OH, and one more thing. If they ever try seating you in one of the booths in the back that are big and rounded, don't do it if you're a bigger built person. You will have a hard time squeezing in, an uncomfortable meal, and a hard time getting out. I'm not a big girl, and it was even somewhat snug for me to sit back in those booths. I could only imagine how someone bigger than me would feel. Definitely need to make the booths have more room. 

4/5 stars, If there weren't so many kids at this place, I'd have given it a 10 if I could. Crying kids with parents who don't care about their crying kids tend to always ruin restaurant atmosphere, peace, and tranquility for me."}
{"text":"Our lunch party of 10, at 1, took over a hour to get our food, and the food was terrible!  Don't go there if you're a foodie!"}
{"text":"Don't go here for the food or service. Food is outrageously expensive, small portions, no seasoning. You don't have to actually eat in the restaurant to see all the attractions. If you have kids, take them here, walk them around and then leave and go eat somewhere else. $68 for 2 adults and 2 kids (no drinks or dessert and one less expensive kids meal) is crazy.  My fish tacos had one tiny piece of fish and tons of cabbage.  Bland, bland, bland.  Will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Rainforest cafe' is a bar (the drinks can be strong) and merchandise store on the first floor. The environment is loud and filled with jungle noises. Great for children, dates and hanging out with friends. Second floor is the dining area. All the servers are dressed in safari uniforms and there are more elephants, monkeys, birds in the tree tops and vines. Jasmine our server, was the most upbeat, happiest, informative waitress out here!My mouth watered as I read the menu choices... Blackened tapia and ceviche...jungle steak and shrimp mmmmm!! I chose the blackened tilapia and ceviche. All in all enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"2 stars is about right. Other than the nice decor and settings there is little to desire.

We went through the typical 1 hour wait to be seated, then 30 minutes waiting for food. And food was terrible, blend and rubbery, even the chocolate lava that kids crave didnt come out right, too sweat and watery. These kinds of crap for $29 per dish?

The only delight besides decor was the folks bringing kids balloons and tricks with twisting them."}
{"text":"Eh. This rainforest cafe has a lot to be desired. Came here while we were in town for the Super Bowl and wasn't impressed. Our server less then serviced us and the food seemed to take forever to come out and there was less then 5 tables taken in the place. Usually I love rainforest but this one I think I'll skip if I'm ever in town again!"}
{"text":"No fish in the tanks anymore. They went to the Las Vegas location. The food was good and nice portions. Grandkids loved it."}
{"text":"No wonder this is low rated. Came in as we haven't been in a long while thought it would be a good place for the kids.  This place is old dusty and smells bad inside. We sat for 20 minutes without anyone coming to our Table and after two inquiries if we had a server.  One person said I'm sure someone will be with you and the other one came when we were leaving.  Talked to Tom the GM and he didn't seem too surprised.  When we walked in one of the hosts said let them sit wherever we have servers standing around doing nothing.  Wow - last try - this place has gone down - very sad - needs an entire revamp - Landry's - what happened?!"}
{"text":"Service is horrible and management needs training on how to approach a table when there is a problem....NOT \"hi what can I help u with?\" 

Worst customer service! The story is to long to even type....it's horrible"}
{"text":"Not bad for a \"concept\" restaurant.

Took a long time to get food but it was decent. I had the soup and sandwich combo, my mom had the fish and chips, my son had the chicken salad sandwich.

Nothing to rave about, better for the \"ohh\" and \"ahh\" factor for younger kids than for the food."}
{"text":"This restaurant is more for entertainment than for grub. I brought my four year old niece here after the Sea Life aquarium for more fun entertainment while attempting to get her to eat some lunch. It was pretty empty and thus the hostess let us choose wherever we wanted to sit. I asked for the best locale with the most animation and she sat us next to the elephants. Once my niece's high pitched scream of \"elephants, look at the elephants, Tasia, look at the elephants. No, look there. There's the elephants\" stopped we were able to sit down and take a peek at the menu.

The restaurant offers a wide variety from a Chinese chicken salad to coconut shrimp, to a few different cuts of beef. I opted for a side Caesar salad (minus the Caesar dressing) with a raspberry vinaigrette dressing that left the romaine lettuce looking for croutons to used as life preservers. The only plus to the side salad  was that it did come with a very scrumptious rosemary infused roll. I also split a burger with my mom that was okay. The cook did a good job getting my medium temperature request right, but the burger just lacked flavor. The burger usually comes with chips but we opted for  \"safari fries\" which again, were okay. I guess being sprinkled with Old Bay flavoring qualities for the \"safari\" title. My niece got the Mac n Cheese that she devoured pretty quickly which is rare. My suspicion leads to the fact that she just wanted to run around the restaurant and look at the other animatronic animals as opposed to it being outstanding Mac n Cheese.
The atmosphere is pretty rad. They really do a good job with the rainforest theme. There are misters over certain parts of the restaurant (not directly over patrons), sparkling twinkling lights on the ceiling, a few fish tanks and many animatronic animals: elephants, apes, a cheetah, and an alligator when you first walk in. Every so often (maybe ever 30 mins?) there is a \"storm\". The lights dim and flash and the sound system plays thunder while all the animals make noises. It's definitely a great place to bring kids and definitely not a quiet restaurant.

Based on the food, I'd give it a 3 star rating maybe 2.5, but the atmosphere deserves a 5 for what it successfully accomplishes. I also like the fact that they have a donation pond when you leave (or enter, but I missed that going in) to through loose change into. That is where the animatronic alligator is located and it's fun to try and get the change in his mouth when he opens it."}
{"text":"Been to Rainforest Cafe a few times. Wasn't our first choice for lunch on this day but seemed like a good idea for the group of families we were with. 

It's difficult for me to justify paying $$$ for food that is completely overpriced and just meh. I have no problem paying $$$ for amazing food. Rainforest is just OVERPRICED!!! It's a tourist trap. The group we were with ordered the Icee special souvenir cups...these were $8.99 each!!! Holy crap. We only got one. It was the same price as their kids meal.

I was scanning the menu and forgot how expensive this place is. Chicken dishes were $19.99 and up. Salads started at $16.99. Appetizers were pricey as hell. Couldn't get over the menu prices. 

The kids got pizza and mac & cheese. The presentation was cute with junior food trays which reminded me of cafeteria food or prison food. Ha. Cute presentation. The kids meals are expensive at $8.99 and comes with free soda. My kids only get soda at special events like weddings or parties. I made an exception today since we were with friends. 

I shared the appetizer sampler with my friend and ordered a veggie flatbread for myself. This was pretty good and the crust was nice and soft but I wish the crust was thinner.

At the end of the day, I wouldn't voluntarily choose to dine at Rainforest Cafe unless it was for a special party or with friends who chose this spot. The space is much smaller than other Rainforest Cafes we have been to. Not much of a spectacular show we have seen in the past at other locations. Way too small. The menu prices are a turn off. If you're going to charge absurd prices for your food, make it AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"Good food and great service...had a blast on our mini vacation from Oregon. We make it a point to stop in when we are in l.v"}
{"text":"Met some family from out of town here and I was slightly impressed. I had the steak and cheese sandwich and it was really good. Two of my cousins had salads and they said they were pretty good. The kids seemed to like all their meals as well, but of course they were having so much fun looking at everything they would have eaten anything. 

The service was way better than the service in Las Vegas. They were quick with the food once we ordered, and when I added an extra side after getting out food it came out right away. Everyone was very nice and not overly pushy. 

The girl in the gift shop was all over us every time we turned the corner asking if we needed help (which was kind of annoying), but she did give us a discount on everything we bought. I'm guessing they weren't making quota or something."}
{"text":"They seriously have THE coolest set up & ambiance- but it ends there.

Food is overpriced.

Hardly any healthy options.

Servers were overloaded so it took forever to get anything."}
{"text":"Quickly seated considering the line, but that's where the positive's end. Ordered strawberry lemonade and it tasted like dirty strawberry water - it was not drinkable. We ordered mozzarella sticks as an app, which didn't come until our meal did. And for our meal, my husband and I split the \"Lotus Temple Trio,\" an unreasonable $26.99 for obviously frozen breaded, unseasoned shrimp; raw in the middle (effing disgusting) fish; and charred-beyond-edible chicken. Added a side salad - a whopping $6.99 - to go with our meal as it only came with a scant scoup of white rice, and half the greens were browned and it was missing the tomatoes. Took forever to get our food after we were seated and we were never checked on until the \"end\" (our food hardly touched) when asked if we wanted to order dessert. No thanks. And we'll never be back."}
{"text":"This review is for the bar service. While waiting for a movie we wanted to grab a drink 20 minutes before the mall closed. We stopped by Garcia's and the bartender was so rude, we went over to Rainforest. The bartender was friendly, fast, and even made a custom drink within 20 minutes. Drinks were good and we were happy!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to take children.  Large aquariums stocked with big colorful fish are everywhere. A really big fountain inside the restaurant adds to the ambiance as does all the moving animal displays and the whole feeling of being inside of an actual rainforest.  There are even thunder and lightning along with shooting stars.  The food is good enough and the service is adequate."}
{"text":"The food portions were large and I couldn't complain about the quality!  The atmosphere is always fun with the occasional rain storms and animals that move and make noises.  My son had a great time.  The food is kinda pricey but it is a fun place to go once and a while."}
{"text":"Real nice atmosphere. Inside and outside seating. A nice place to bring your kids. 
I been there 3 times. For breakfast and lunch. Egg poach for breakfast and Salmon for lunch are on point. 
Service getting into the restaurant is a little shaky. The guy that welcomed me into the restaurant on two occasions was not polite.
Ask for Arelly as your waitress. She was wonderful, polite, quick and knows how to treat customers. 
I visited on a Sunday afternoon and didn't understand why I had to wait 15 mins for a table upstairs and downstairs was empty. There was no waiter at the bar. The non polite guy said the waiter was upstairs. 
I will return and recommend to friends."}
{"text":"I am sad to report that their sampler platter has shrunk in size. Now they call it an appetizer platter and it's still the same price but they took away the shrimp skewers. Maybe they weren't popular with other people?? but I love my coconut shrimp on a stick. They took away the ribs (I think?) and replaced it with some dry breaded chicken. However, the best thing about the appetizer platter is the southwestern eggrolls. Also, the artichoke and spinach dip is super good just the bowl they give the dip in is a tad smaller too. That's why I'm giving you Rainforest Café only three stars. Boo!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed eating here. It was entertaining and something different to experience for a change. The first meal I had was a bacon cheeseburger made perfectly to how I'd like it. The burger was good sized and looked fantastic. The bacon was thick and very crispy with a large nicely toasted bun. The beef patty had an excellent char and gave the whole burger a nice rich smoky taste which was very satisfying. The fries were done perfectly to a golden color giving them a nice crisp and they were great being lightly seasoned as well. The second time we ate at the Rainforest Cafe, I ordered the ribs. The rack of ribs were pretty good, again the fries were also done very well too, but the next day I got sick and I believe it was due to the ribs I ate that night. I can't really be sure, but it wasn't a deal changer for me either way. I had ordered a blue nile drink along with it and thought that was also pretty good. Overall it was a thumbs up for me."}
{"text":"Waited an hour to get our food when the place was empty. We were a party of 8 for a work lunch. The drinking water tastes like it is out of the fish tank"}
{"text":"The restaurant was very empty and we were seated immediately.  That is when the problems began.  It took 25 minutes for someone to acknowledge us and the person who took the drink orders brought our kids (3 & 5) their drinks in adult cups.  The server finally made an appearance, acknowledged the long wait and said she would send a manager over.  This never happened.  She took our order and then we had to wait anther 25 minutes for the food to come out.  When the server said the food would be out in a minute and I asked what was taking so long to cook it, she snapped at me stating that she just told me that it would be right out.  My wife's Asian Shrimp Salad was soggy and the shrimp were cold, as if it had been sitting for some time.  My meal, the Ribs Steak Shrimp Trio was OK except for the issue that the steak was cooed to barely medium when I asked for medium well...25 minutes for a medium rarish steak?  The manager was apologetic and took my meal off the bill.  He then offered several times sundaes to the kids.  I was angry we still had to pay for this meal at all given the issues.  This is not the first time we have had these issues at this restaurant.  Although the kids love it, we have explained to them that we will no longer be going to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I love the whole experience of the Rainforest cafe but this visit was not memorable. I ordered the drink where you keep the glass. It was watered down and not what you'd expect for 15.00. I also ordered the anaconda pasta which was dissapointing. The animation was not on and only after mentioning it, they turned it on. Unless they improve I think they will lose many guests. It used to be one of my favorite places. As it is, I may not go back any time soon."}
{"text":"I thought I was going there for the kids fun and for good food...and I was right!

Yes it looks fun, yes it's great atmosphere, yes there's much to see, yes...yes... yes...

now! food-wise... I was amazed to have good food. I had Chicken Alfredo and It was just right! huge portion and what kick it up a notch was the HOT ROSEMARY FOCACIA BREAD! 

we all won! kids had fun and mom had good food. I will come again for a special occasion since it is a bit pricey - I must say
The end :)"}
{"text":"Kids loved it. Adults thought food was just okay and drinks were overpriced. It is loud and service was rushed and impersonal. Dessert ( flaming volcano) was good and great way to celebrate a kid's birthday."}
{"text":"Been to this place too many times and it never gets better. Bums me out because the kiddos love it but Rainforest Tempe are beyond unorganized, food comes out cold, hard and nasty plus it takes over an hour to receive. Please clean up your act...we really want this place to be good so we can come back."}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant the food was unexpectedly good.  Enough for use to think about coming back.  The drinks were very light and the service was slow.   If it wasn't for the food it would have been a 2 star."}
{"text":"waited 45 minutes for food talked to the manager she said i will discount your check when the bill came for 2 people it was $60 she took off $4 I would never go back"}
{"text":"At first thought the restaurant had closed... only to find it had moved to a new spot, right on the strip.  Sat on the patio overlooking the strip and loved it! 

Next,  our waiter (Doug from Miami) was easy going and helpful. 

Since being in Vegas we'd struggled finding something that didn't smell like we smoked a pack of cigarettes (quite the criteria huh?!) Maybe it was a lucky day on the patio but it was smoke free.  

The food arrived... it was delicious. I had the shrimp salad (by the way, the shrimp was well seasoned & plenty of them!) THE ONLY bad thing was I was starving and forgot to take a picture of my food until mostly gone!

During our meal the misters started dripping which was kinda funny but someone got right on it.  

Service was fantastic, food was good combined with patio overlooking the strip -NICE! Definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Pretty cool! We sat on the patio, the service was very welcoming and we were helped right away. The food was pretty good and the strawberry lemonade was AMAZING. I had told the servers it was my birthday and they brought me a little cupcake with a candle and sang the birthday song to me. It was really great!"}
{"text":"Food is barely average.  Total waste of money on appetizers ( awful dip, dry and weird tasting chicken fingers). Fun for kids. No comparison to Orlando rainforest."}
{"text":"I've been 3 different rainforest cafe's and this one is such a disappointment. It's very small. No waterfall, no aquariums. Foods were meh. Waited 10 minutes to be seated. And took forever to get our foods after ordered. 
I like rainforest cafe's always take my friends and family from out of town but I won't come this one again."}
{"text":"Well first of all it took almost an hour for them to seat us when they said the wait was only about 30 minutes. We had a party of 8. I mentioned we had a birthday when they took our name down. So then we get seated and notice there are many tables open in the area they sat us. (Huh took an hour to seat us with this many tables) Then about 15 minutes goes by as we watch 4 others big tables get sat down and a server comes and asks for our drink order and tells us she is helping out our server for a moment because she was pregnant and needed to us the restroom. Ok...... didn't even bother to walk around our table to take our order kinda yells from the end of the table what did each of us want. Ok now we wait for our drinks to come, mind you that took almost another 15-20 minutes. Not even together almost one drink at a time. We order an app to Start with, the app comes out and takes another 5 minutes to get us side plates. Then our server comes to the table to take our order and does nothing but complain how she's pregnant and that she might need to leave to the doctor. Now we sit for almost an hour before we get our entrees, in the meantime our server has not been seen nor has anyone come by our table to take our dirty app plates or ask if we needed any refills on our drinks. We finally get the servers attention to get refills on drinks and she doesn't even take the dirty plates from our table. Dinner has finally gotten to the table(now that it's been over 2 hours that we have been in this place) my sister order a burger and it was so dry and tasted like dirt, my mom ordered fish and chips she could almost knock on the table with the fish....my nephew got kids shrimp and Idk what to say about that it was just bad. The whole dinner was ridiculous. Some other waiter comes to the table to ask if we needed anything in which we tell him about the burger and the fish. He brings the Manger Cathy over to the table and she says that she will take it off of our bill. Now this whole time our server never once came back to see if everything was ok nor did she ever mention her name. Now in the beginning I mentioned we had a birthday.....yea what wtf for???? They went and sang to many other tables but never our! Biggest disappointment ever. It  was as if Cathy the Manger didn't even care that our experience was bad. From the wait time to be seated to the wait for someone to take our drink order from the time they took our order to getting our food to the horrible food that came to our table. Can't believe we paid $200 for that bs."}
{"text":"We have been here multiple times and every time we are pleased with the food and service.   In their new location, they have more room and a patio.  Worth checking out every time."}
{"text":"The Rainforest is now on top of the miracle mile shopping center which is great because parking is free. Also you don't have to walk through a casino to get to it so you don't smell like a cigarette by the time you get there. The show is much better at this location because it's smaller and you can actually feel like you're in a rain forest and a storm without seeing tourists walking by with their luggage. The animals are obviously new and there's different animals than the old location at MGM. The patio is the best part because it has the best view of the strip than anywhere. The happy hour is also awesome with beer and cocktails starting at three dollars. What a great place!"}
{"text":"When the grandchildren are in town, this becomes a de-rigueur visit. It does not much have to offer to adult. You have to walk through a souvenir store, which cause countless stress (with young children).

The decor with tons of dangling plastic foliage, is probably becoming a health hazard. There is no way that they can wash or clean all the foliage, or even dust it.

The kids, however, enjoy the animatronics, which rain forest gorillas putting on a show every so often.

The food is forgettable, the service desultory, and lax. This restaurant is part of the Landry's chain, which is being financially pinched by the receding economy in the U.S. They will pinch you in the wallet, as food is quite pricey.

But the kids love it! I guess we could take them to the zoo...but wait...they go there too."}
{"text":"Worst Rain Forest experience we've ever had. This is our 3rd location thay we've visited. The service was SO SO slow.

We are Landry's members. Normally we are treated very well, seated and served quickly. Not this time. We waited for a good 15 minutes while there were TONS of empty tables. Our waitress didn't take our drink order for 10 minutes. The manager stopped by to thank us for being members and said he would be back later to check on everything. He never came, which was probably for the better because he would have gotten an ear ful. 

Food was so so, had to ask for refills, asked for a to go box which we never got. Our waitress brought us someone else's card back. It was just not a good deal.

Won't be returning to this location."}
{"text":"I'm probably a die-hard Rainforest Café fan.
I just love it. The Yorkdale location more than the Niagara falls location (although I've been to both many times since I was a preteen). I've noticed the service and quality aren't as good as they used to be and sometimes its hit or miss. It is a tad overpriced but I do like the food and the atmosphere (gorillas beating on their chests, a crocodile in the front, elephants raising their trunks, butterflies flapping their wings, an aquarium filled with fish and the starry sky, yeah... I love it). Basing off my last experience, dinner on a Saturday night, I'd say it was pretty good. We didn't have reservations and the wait was 35 minutes but I didn't care. I was in Yorkdale.. more time to shop, and the mall closes at 9 PM ON SATURDAY NIGHTS!!!
We shopped and came back, they initialed a sheet of paper and sent us to another line. I was confused at first because they gave us no instructions but the \"tour guide\" for the line was really nice and in less than five minutes we were seated. 
I have to say, the service was a little slow. I didn't mind because we got an appetizer, but if we had only ordered mains I know I would be starving during the wait.

I ordered a strawberry daiquiri (with whipped cream!) $9, Mogambo shrimp pasta (my favourite) $23.99, and my boyfriend and I shared a dynamite shrimp appetizer (free when you check in!).

The strawberry daiquiri was delicious, I had to get it. They dynamite shrimp appetizer was really good, it was a shrimp dip with delicious deep fried chips. It had a distinct sweet flavour to it, it's something I would have again. The Mogambo shrimp pasta was pretty good, the only issue I had with it was that instead of the noodles they used to use (I think it was penne, maybe bowtie, probably penne...) were now replaced with spiral macaroni. I did not like that. I will specifically ask for penne next time.
The sauce was good-a little thinner than I remembered, there was lots of shrimp, and the sun dried tomatoes and mushrooms were good.
Our server was friendly and somewhat attentive (it was busy) and the manager came by to see how our meal was.
I had a great dinner and a great experience. I know I'll be back :)."}
{"text":"As a visitor to Las Vegas, this place was super interesting and fun! The decor of the restaurant really makes you feel like you're in a rainforest, from the trees, to the moving animals and sound effects. We had a blast finding all the different animals around the restaurant!

There is a large variety of food and drinks on the menu. I ordered the spicy korean chicken. I asked for less peppers in an effort to have it not as spicy. Overall the meal was good but the sauce was very strong and there was a ton of rice that became a little soggy due to the sauce being on the bottom of the bowl. 

Our server was very friendly and attentive. We asked for a lot of different things and he was quick and polite while going back and forth."}
{"text":"Nice place for kids, good food an excellent dessert. Really friendly and good service.
 I love it!!!"}
{"text":"First time coming here with my family. We were seated very quickly. Staff was friendly and knowledgable of the menu. The food was a bit pricey in my opinion, even when using coupons, the sales tax just brings it right back to original pricing. (Bummer) Steak was amazing amazing amazing! Definitely great experience.. I can see coming to this restaurant for special occasions."}
{"text":"I am on a special diet and the chef personally came out to answer my questions and she is preparing my meal to order. Amazing friendly service and an awesome view of the strip!"}
{"text":"You're paying for the atmosphere when you come to rain forest Cafe. Kids and teenagers would like this.  As far as a date with an adult not so much. Kids friendly, menu is priced high, regular American menu."}
{"text":"It is a fun place to take kids but can be distracting for adults.  There are times when the animals move, rain comes down in one area as \"lightning\" flashes.  We had good service and the food portions were big.  The food was fine.    There are aquariums to look at while waiting for a meal.  It's a bit pricey for just a meal though not outrageous but if you want entertainment for the kids, the price isn't that bad."}
{"text":"Nice enviroment, i liked that it was not really loud and the nature sounds are unique. Food took too long, but the burgers were great. Not so much for the tropical chicken salad, though the quantity was g"}
{"text":"I took my son to this location for his 20th birthday.  The outdoor patio was lovely as the sun set and the lights on the strip lit up.  Our waiter Hugo was very attentive and the food was great.  I will visit again during my next trip to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Not impressed.... This place is obviously popular for the ambiance; if you like tacky decor and loud noises you found the right place! About every 8-10 minutes there is a loud \"thunder storm\" complete with loud cracks of thunder that drown out your conversation and flashing lights. 
The menu has good potential but the food you get is nothing like what is described. Our waitress didn't write anything down, which isn't a problem if there are 2-3 people. We were a party of 5 (haha) and I was nervous that things would get forgotten. Things were forgotten. I had the Chinese Chicken Salad and a \"Cheetah-Rita.\" The margarita mix was WAY too sweet and I couldn't tastes the alcohol (I may also have a drinking problem.... Yet to be determined). The dressing was about the only thing enjoyable. The chicken was dry like it was from lunch yesterday and may have been overlooked then. My best friend had the Chicken Parmesan and subbed mashed potatoes for the pasta but they brought out pasta anyway... Also forgot the applesauce that was to come with her son's pizza. One of the other girls in our party ordered nachos and asked to have a few things left off as well as extra cheese. The nachos came out with little cheese and all of the things she asked to have omitted. My sister seemed to enjoy her lunch, or at least was not vocal about it. 
Upon coming to check on us, the waitress asked if everything was ok and exclaimed \"Oh no the cooks didn't read the ticket!\" Cooks are not stupid and were certainly not too busy to ignore special requests. Waitresses who don't write anything down are prone to forgetting things. 
Almost finished with our meal and my friend and her sister were not offered refills. Regardless of how far into a meal you are, the waitress or another staff member should offer a refill."}
{"text":"The good, fun for kids. My daughter enjoyed her Dino shaped nuggets.

The bad, prices are high for value/food, and you have to walk thru the gift shop on your way out.

The ugly, poor service. The hostess walked around and kept us waiting for 10 minutes in a virtually empty restaurant. She did not greet us, tell us to have a nice meal or say thanks you on our way out. Really a glum, sloth like woman who would best serve this restaurant by washing dishes....far away from people."}
{"text":"Ines was the best waitress I have seen in a long time! She was very personable and joked around with are party! Hats off to you for 5 star service! Food was good but margarita lacked as it tasted like a mixer was used, thus the 4 stars instead of 5."}
{"text":"I mean it's a cool place to take your kids and I'm assuming the prices are comparable to other places on the strip. The food was actually not bad."}
{"text":"Rainforest Cafe holds a nostalgiac place in my heart, but it disappointed me a little tonight. The place was surprisingly busy and I don't think the staff was equipped for this. The waitress was awesome and attentive as she could be, but was still absent. Unfortunately, I was given RAW onions and tomatoes in my mixed grilled seasonal veggies. The waitress apologized and offered me another side but I was unable to get the raw onion taste out of my mouth until after our meal. Besides this, the atmosphere was fun and the other food was average."}
{"text":"I have been to the Rainforest Cafe a few times before...thats right...a few. It's a fun place, regular thunderstorms, moving animals, pleasant night skys and such. This place really is a lot of fun for kids...which is precisely why it was perfect that my most recent visit was with Evelyn W., my big kid friend. 

We had a tough day of shopping at Yorkdale so we ventured in for some grub. We got the big app platter which was pretty gross...aside from the Asiago dip, which was delish. You may notice that Evelyn W. made fun of my ordering the garlic mash which was AMAZING while she ordered Clam chowder. Of all the things to order in a chain restaurants I would put Claim chowder top of list of things most risky...nevertheless...she loved it, but I stand by my point. An try the side of mash. Yum.

The 411 on the RFC is that it is a really fun place to bring kids, the food is a little pricey but they will have A LOT of fun. It's the closest to disney you can get in Yorkdale. If you haven't been here yet it's worth a trip especially if you're a big kid....get the fountain pop for sure...REFILLS!"}
{"text":"My niece wanted to take her children here for lunch today, approximately 1215- wait in a short line, many many open tables. Our turn hostess said we now have to wait 10minutes more unless we are are Landry (?) my niece was, that sat us immediately. Waitress came took orders and drinks said its 10 min wait but she put our food in first. Place is half empty still! 60 minutes later our food comes out, fries cold, burger barely warm. I told the manager about fries he did bring new ones out-Not one word of an apology for the wait! 
Food not that great,service is horrible I still tipped. Just won't be back."}
{"text":"Needs improvement on every level. The rainforest was nice back in the day like 12 years ago. Now it's totally outdated. The entire restaurant sucks. The food totally overpriced for the portion you get and for the food quality. The waiters are not representable. Very disappointing:("}
{"text":"My favorite salad \"China Island Chicken Salad\" has disappeared from the menu, as has a whole bunch of other items. We are sad and basically got up and left without ordering anything. We will call before we ever visit any rainforest again just to see if they brought our salad back, if not well ~ adios!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was fairly empty yet it took 21 minutes for our food to come. I got a big appetizer combo and it was dried out. It tasted like it was cooked hours earlier. For a$70 bill I wish I had gone to Johnny Rockets. Disappointed."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I had been here. Even in the middle of the day all the animator can are going and are VERY loud. I had to shout to be heard and we were even at a table deliberately away from some of the \"animals.\" This is more of a place for kids.  Our server was very friendly but was not focused. We each had a salad, different ones.  We waited a while before server came back and then waited again for a while when we requested our check. I looked later at my receipt and he had put my table mates lunch on my CC and vice versa. I know we didn't hand it to him that way. So I guess you could say we bought each other lunch. Won't be back. Too noisy and inefficient and also pretty expensive. I don't mind paying if the food is superb. This was okay."}
{"text":"You don't go to rainforest cafe for a fine dining experience, you go for the atmosphere. It's a great place for kids.  I do appreciate that the chef comes out to go over the gluten free options with you. I ordered salmon which came with rice and veggies. It was really lacking flavor. The rice actually had the best flavor of everything on my plate. The vegetables were undercooked. I tried my daughters cheese quesadilla made with corn tortillas. It was decent. Despite only a two rating, we will go back because the kids enjoy the rainforest theme, especially when there's a storm."}
{"text":"We finally decided to try this place. We will not be returning. The decor is so dated and reminded me of a chuck e cheese venue. However, it was dark and cool, so that was ok. The menu has decent variety but an average lunch was about 16 bucks. If i was spending that much at a gimmick eatery, then why not try the steak and shrimp? For 24 bucks, it had to be good right? Wrong. First, they forgot to bring the coconuts shrimp so a manager had to intervene. That'd because our waitress was nowhere to be found. The food was luke warm and of poor quality. The scampi and steak were completely flavorless and not cooked properly. There was no sauce that had flavor either. The shrimp was small and rubbery. The steak had so many fat strands that I could not cut it. When you see over half of the steak on the plate, you might want to ask the customer if something was wrong. Not once did anyone ask how the food was. Even when i filled out a comment card, they still didn't ask. I spent 70 dollars for 3 plates of food. Save your money and go get good food and service elsewhere. Not worth it! We will not be back. Want a gimmick place to eat for 70 bucks? Steer clear of this one."}
{"text":"Overpriced food and mediocre service.  My son had the kids pizza and barely touched it as it didn't taste good  (. 99 cent pizza inflated to $6.00).  I paid in cash including tip.  When I asked for a copy of receipt after paying turns out they took off the $6,  but waitress decided to keep that for herself"}
{"text":"Located in the Yorkdale mall, this joint reminds me exactly of Mall Cop. Came here with a couple of people. At first, you're thinking this is a nice change of scenery. It's not your usual restaurant like atmosphere. But it gets old. Very fast! They actually stuck us right next to a giant fake tree which overhung the table so there was actually less space for us. Now that's a poor design layout. 

Started off with some wings and calamari. meh. I've had better. Actually. I've had them better at a lot more places. Nothing very exciting about these. Got myself a rainforest burger for the main course and meh .... nothing fantastic either. By now, the atmosphere is really starting to piss me off and I can't wait to get out. Don't think I'll be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Very entertaining place to eat. The animals move and the occasional thunderstorm rolls thru. The food was pretty good as well. It definitely feels like a kids restaurant but the menu is made for kids and adults."}
{"text":"We always see the restaurant/store in the mall and never sat down so we said we will give it a try. We waited in line for thirty minutes for no reason because half the restaurant was empty. We finally sat down and the service was extremely bad. We waited for over 40 minutes for a children's Mac n cheese. While the child just started her meal then the server came and dropped the check without us asking for it. So rude! The manager took it off the bill but did not offer desert for the other bad service.
For sure we will not eat here again. Just enjoy the store and atmosphere. To bad. Huge disappointment."}
{"text":"So we came here for my sisters 21st birthday. She's a grown woman child...so it was fitting. It was a party of 13 and a baby. Jimmy was our server along with (I think his name is) Alex. He looks kind of like a thinner, taller Josh Hutcherson. Either way. Both of them were AMAZING servers. Jimmy put his \"salesman routine\" on a bit thick and it got kind of annoying at times. Especially because, as I was walking by a door I heard him say \"I do it for the sales...\" Lol. 

But anyways. Aside from the great service, the food was pretty good too! I had a big chicken and fruit salad and more than a few drinks. Everything was awesome. The environment was great and we love all of the animatronics. We've loved coming here since we were kids. I do miss the old place though. It was probably too big for the amount of business they normally have. Either way. Love it."}
{"text":"I have not been to a Rainforest Cafe in years and neither has my boyfriend so we decided to come here for lunch. When we went up to the second floor to the restaurant area, it took a few minutes before a hostess emerged and seated us. Our server was very kind and personable. My boyfriend and I ordered two mixed drinks in the souvenir glass. I thought that the drink was good but it could have used more alcohol in it. We skipped out on appetizers and went straight for the entrees. I had the coconut shrimp, which comes with coleslaw and a side, while my boyfriend had the chicken parm, which comes with pasta and a piece of garlic bread. I thought my entree was just ok, the dish wasn't very flavorful. My boyfriend liked his chicken parm but said that the garlic bread was very hard. Our check came to $80 plus a $17 tip, which I thought was very high for two souvenir drinks and two entrees. I think the food leaves a lot to be desired. However, the server was great, and I really enjoyed the atmosphere. Since we ordered the souvenir drinks, our server told us to bring the copy of our check to the downstairs shop area to redeem. The cashier was nowhere to be found so we had to ask a server who happened to be down there for assistance. Eventually the cashier came back downstairs and gave us our glasses. When we got back to the hotel, the one glass had a chip at the base, which was disappointing. I don't know if I would come back here the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and nice decor. This place is great if you have kids but don't go expecting to take a hot date unless you want something a little laid back. They do however have happy hour and $3 shots which is fantastic on the strip so you can go and people watch and get some cheap drinks on the strip"}
{"text":"Kids loved seeing all the animals super fun for kids. Friendly service took a while for food to show up.  I would go back."}
{"text":"All I can say about this place is save your money!!! If you are looking for ambiance and terrible food, this is the place.  I have waited a long time to try a Rainforest Cafe and I was really disappointed!  The food around us did not look appealing so we ordered the appetizer platter.  The artichoke spinach dip was so thick and overcooked that the chips kept breaking.  The mozzarella sticks were overcooked and the cheese was rubbery. The chicken egg roll things were awful and had some kind of funky sauce. The chicken tenders were probably the most edible thing on the plate.  I still think for $15.99 this appetizer plater was not a deal!  We had also called and made a reservation for a booth by the waterfall and of course when we got there there were no booths left! So don't waste your time with reservations!  I really would like to say something nice about the place but between the food and service, I won't be back!!"}
{"text":"Extremely overpriced! Hamburger that did not taste good at all 13.00 . Stir fry was terrible ,way too salty! Food in general not great. The animal stuff is really cute for the kids but loud . After leaving the zoo it seemed so cheesy! ( to us adults anyway) . Just should have read reviews first because 130.00 later I wish we had gone for fast food as I am sure my son in law does too after getting stuck paying for this very substandard meal!!!"}
{"text":"New location, not as great. No amazing fish tanks. No fish tanks at all actually. Food not great. We had Jessica as our server, she was good. The hostess Cecila also was great, gave us a good table. It's fun to do with smaller kids once or so, but that's it. It's superbly overpriced, but that the Vegas Strip for ya."}
{"text":"So this place has gone downhill. The only cool thing here is the decor and when the animals start talking. This restaurant use to be a happening  place and you had to wait to be seated. Not anymore!  The hostess was rude and lazy. We were seated near the bathroom entrance even though there were plenty of tables available. It took 10 minutes for our server just to greet us them
Another 10 minutes to get our drinks. We actually received our appetizer before our drinks. Food was just okay. It lacked flavor. I went with the chicken fried chicken and they forgot my potatoes. My server was MIA most of the time and I had to find another server to help me get a box and the bill. I was so sad to see this place go to the Pitts. It is a fun place to come visit if you are out of town to see the decor but that is it. 


By the way Bathrooms were so dirty and disgusting."}
{"text":"This was my family and my first visit to this impressive and delightful restaurant. We dined here after walking the entire length of Arizona Mills. It was nice to be greeted by a warm and friendly hostess whom seated us at a comfortable booth. Our waitress was lovely and attentive. She brought our refreshing drinks to our table quickly and took our order. She knew a lot about the dishes on the menu.
Our food was hot, fresh and delicious. I ordered the seafood platter. Everything was tasty served up with shrimp scampi, butterfly shrimp, tilapia, hush puppies, coleslaw, fries, spicy cocktail sauce and tartar sauce.
My son ordered the cheeseburger quesadilla with fries; my other son ordered a cheeseburger with fries and my daughter ordered a lettuce cheeseburger wrap with veggies as she has to eat gluten free.
We enjoyed the entertainment with the animatronic animals, the lightening and rain.
It was a wonderful dinner and a treat. I highly recommend dining here if you come to the mall."}
{"text":"Restaurants that have you exit through the gift shop are a curious sort of place to dine. That someone thinks a restaurant even needs a gift shop might have some of the youngin's on Yelp confused (as opposed to immediately suspect). 

\"Zowie, Uncle Karl, are there dining experiences so amazing that you really want to buy a tshirt to let everyone know you supped there?\"

The short answer is \"no\". The long answer is still \"no\" but gather round, padawans, for another one of Uncle Karl's tales of 1990s horror. Bill Clinton was in the White House, a young Will Ferrell was teaching America to laugh, and people were seemingly growing tired of dining and then seeing a show, preferring to get back to their VHS systems and AOL. 

What if you could combine dining with some of the aspects of theater? Surely, Americans would flock to your door. The great thing about capitalism is it doesn't take much of an idea, or an idea at all, to set off a flurry of competition. 

Rainforest Cafe, of which this Yelp review is about, is the sole remaining survivor of the great Themed Restaurant bubble of the 1990s. We had Planet Hollywood, Fashion Cafe, Harley-Davidson Cafe, Copperfield's Magic Underground, the Star Trek Experience Bar and Manatee's Coastal Sea Life Aquarium on a Plate. 

Most of these places went bust by the latter part of the millennium when it became apparent the market for $14 hamburgers served with potato chips was limited or might not have outright existed. Staring at a glass display case containing the sari Ben Kingsley wore in Gandhi really doesn't make your burger taste any better, no matter what a marketing guru in a pastel blazer (http://www.wallpaperbase.com/wallpapers/movie/miamivice/miami_vice_2.jpg) tells you.

So the question remains why the Rainforest cafe survived the Great and Horrible Themed Restaurant Contraction of 2000. You still get a $14 burger that comes with potato chips. There's a $1 extra option for fries. Maybe that saved them. While kids no doubt have no clue why an adult would want to, or should, get excited about dining next to a display case containing Tom Cruise's first pair of Wayfares or a guitar signed by the members of Chalk Circle, an animatronic monkey on a swing that lights up every fifteen minutes is pure crack to an 8 year old.

The children like this place. I guess. If you don't like dining with children, or prefer to simply dine on them, you might want to give this place a pass. If you have kids and have never considered the wisdom of turning them into a ready source of protein, this might be cheaper than a day at Wonderland."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful time and enjoyed all our food & drinks! It was my mothers birthday & our server Tracey made it very memorable with her wonderful attitude & permanent smile she had on her face! The staff came over and sang happy birthday which was so nice and thoughtful! Food was great, the drinks were delicious, & the service was amazing! Can't wait to come back again"}
{"text":"For of Harmon & Las Vegas Blvd this restaurant sucks. First this place was dead. We had to wait for a clean table on the outside balcony. Our appetizer was give to someone else and we order salads that came out wilted and old looking. The shrimp in it was the only thing half way desent. Basically we spent a 100 bucks on two souvenir tiki cups. This place sucks and we will definitely not be back. Maybe it's that corner spot because Bubba Gump Shrimp is not good either. I don't think I will ever try Twin Peaks."}
{"text":"I'm surprised to see so many bad reviews. Our experience was great! Everything from the decor that literary takes you to the jungle, to the service was outstanding. Probably the best breakfast we've ever had. I've attached a photo. We had the breakfast tacos and viper pie."}
{"text":"I give it a 2. My kids give it a 4.

The food is passable, but I agree with all the other reviewers in that it's a theme park mentality...you're paying for atmosphere.

Been to the AZ Mall location a few times and I concur with my fellow yelpers on the \"slacking service\".  Last night we were a party of 8 for my son's birthday and the service was no exception to this...but! No one had to send their food back and my sons left happy. That's good enough for me and I think that's all the management shoots for as well."}
{"text":"Havent been here in ages. This place has sort of lost the appeal it once had for me. As a kid this place was the bomb! Loved the thunderstorm that happened like every half hour, and all the cool robotic animals...But now its just very cliche and plain I find, the food is mediocre, and everything seems like a cheap gimmick. Like c'mon cups with flashy lights in them? Maybe im just too old for this place...So if your a kid, try it out! And if you're an adult...You've been warned!"}
{"text":"I Always come here when I get to Phoenix but sadly there was a long hair in the food. Waiter was horrible. Never going back."}
{"text":"I took the kids to Rainforest Cafe today for lunch. While I know they aren't know for their food, how in the world does any restaurant that serves food that bad stay in business as long as they have? Our first clue should have been the fact that their chicken nuggets are dinosaur shaped chicken nuggets. I guess I didn't realize there were dinosaurs in the rainforest. No wonder I haven't seen a live one!

I order fish tacos and they were absolutely terrible. I send them back and the waitress says they aren't a very popular menu item and that she doesn't like them either. I then order a burger. How can you mess that up? Pretty easily, apparently. It comes out lukewarm and grey. I take a bite and it tastes like it is straight out of the microwave....ten minutes ago. I comment to the waitress and she sends over the manager. He comes over and tells me that 3 or 4 people have commented on them today and that they recently changed to a different type of beef and they now cook them on a flat top, no longer over open flames.

Enough said....thanks for the memories!"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast and this place is really cute. I got the oatmeal which came with toast and a lot of fruit. Very filling and one of the cheaper places I've eaten so far. Definitely kid friendly with all the rainforest decorations, electronic animals, and a simulated rain storm."}
{"text":"It's over rated. Thought my daughter would get a kick out of the place but she was over it as fast as we got there."}
{"text":"I arrived at the restaurant and waited ten minutes before a manger said hi to me. She asked if I've been helped and I said \"no, I've been waiting here to see where a host is.\" She mentioned I was at the right spot but the host was walking around,\" for ten minutes? I was hungry so I thought I would still come in and eat with my fiancé. If you drink more than one cup of water at dinner, don't come here, they will never refill it. Also, our waitress brought out the wrong food and she could tell my fiancé didn't eat it and didn't say anything. I mentioned to her it was the wrong food and we felt like she ignored us until it was time to pay the bill.
This was the first and last time I come to rainforest cafe. Over price food, and you don't even get what you ordered. Service was bad and no fish in the fish tank."}
{"text":"We decided to come here after hearing so many allergy parents recommend it. They did pretty good as far as handling my daughter's food allergies but the service was not so great.

So we arrived at just before 11. They gave breakfast menus because they do not serve lunch until 11. When the server came for the drink order (at least 15 minutes after we were seated) we asked for the lunch menus. At that point it is 10:56. He tells us it's too early for lunch. I asked if we could wait the four minutes. He sends a host with the menus but never comes back. At 11:16 he walks by, says the kitchen is still preparing to serve lunch and keeps walking hurriedly. Another 15 minutes go by, it's 11:30 and he brings another waitress (Lupe) over and says his shift is over and she'll be our server. So, that is why he ignored us for over half an hour. He didn't want a table at the end of his shift and he was busy doing side work as I saw him with a tray of condiments.

I had Informed hostess and the first waiter that I needed to discuss food allergies with the chef. This is supposed to be common for this restaurant. No chef came. When Lupe is finally ready to take our order I tell her and we have to wait some more time for her to bring someone. By the time our order was being actually taken we had been there almost an hour! 

The rest of the visit was ok. Chef went over options. They brought the allergen free food separate and wore gloves  I just wished for better service at the start. I don't want to be ignored for over half an hour because the waiter's shift is ending."}
{"text":"Great breakfast , great view in the patio. The rainforest look is gorgeous . I loved it here."}
{"text":"Service is absolutely ridiculous! Very terrible! They were not even busy! Our food tasted like crap. Definitely a horrible experience."}
{"text":"Terrible. Both me and my son got sick after eating here. All the fish in the tanks are dead. The gorilla is falling apart you can see all the metal like a bad terminator. The food was over priced. We had a hot dog and the signature burger. I will never go here again"}
{"text":"I'm a glutton for punishment,  there's only 2 servers on.

So long long wait buy at least manager is helping run food."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant in Las Vegas along the strip. My friend and I went here specifically because it was supposed to be a very safe place in terms of food allergies. As soon as we arrived we communicated to the hostess about my friends food allergies and she assured us that she would send the chef to speak to us. The chef came to our table immediately and spoke to my friend about her allergies and assured her that he would ensure to cook the food at so as not to cross- contaminate.  Everything was very delicious and the portions were generous. We came back the next day and even ordered special items that we wanted but were not necessarily on the menu.  The chef accommodated all our desires. Great food and excellent customer service!!!!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here a couple of times always enjoyed it good food nice place to eat at never had an issue with service. A bit pricey though, portions are average."}
{"text":"I was waiting for 30 minutes to see if someone is gonna come to ask if I want a drink or something and unfortunately, nobody came. I feel discriminated because I was by myself and they think that I cannot afford their food. Bad experience for a first timer. Poor service."}
{"text":"I found the Rainforest Store to be very disappointing. I went in there with one goal: buy a mechanical parrot. Man, they make the mechanized parrot purchasing experience a nightmare. 

Aside from the fact that the roof leaks and you're constantly in danger of being electrocuted, none of the staff seem at all versed in the features or options of the parrots. Are the roosts sold separately? How much for the whole tree? Can my parrot be \"taught\" new bawdy phrases to delight my friends? 

And when you press them on the issue, they try to divert your attention away from your seemingly simple mission by plying you with alcohol and the shittiest microwaved snacks you can imagine. I mean, it seems like a nice gesture to give you something to nibble on while you wait for a Senior Parrot Specialist to come to your assistance and close the sale; but in the end you just end up wet, hammered, food poisoned and parrotless.

[ UPDATE: When checking my online banking later, I noticed they charged me for the food and drinks! I thought it was complimentary and they just wanted my credit card to put down a deposit on my birdie. What a racket. ]"}
{"text":"This place was pretty cool. Every 15-30 minutes the lights are dimmed and forest music comes on. Honestly this place is more geared towards kids but still a great concept. 

We mainly came here for the happy hours specials. The pina coladas, strawberry daiquiris and margaritas were $4. We got an appetizer and nachos for about $25. So we got full and a little tipsy all under $40."}
{"text":"Headed here after seeing a movie at the Harkins located inside the same mall. We were interested in checking out the menu first since we weren't sure if this one had the same offerings we were used to from the Orlando location we went to from time to time.  

After looking over the menu we decided that we could all find something we wanted to eat here and we were brought a few more menus after a bit. I ordered the Cobb Salad, he had the Turkey BLT Club and our friend had the Quesadilla. The Cobb Salad had a lot of toppings on it and it was well-made, but it was really covered in dressing to a point that it was all you tasted. If we ever go back, I'll definitely request that on the side.

The Club sandwich my husband had was sandwiched with bread that was toasted to a point it wasn't really edible, so he took everything out of it and at that, which kinda defeats the purpose of a sandwich altogether. The insides of the Club were fresh and tasty though and the fries that came with it were good as well.  

Took awhile to get things from our waitress during almost every step of the meal. Which seemed a little odd considering we went during an off time and it wasn't too busy.

Overall: B-
Probably wouldn't recommend it to people with all the other options in the food court just around the corner...but not a bad place if you are looking to entertain little ones."}
{"text":"My four year loves to come here. We usually stop in whenever we are in Phoenix, every couple of months. I am not a huge fan of the food. It is ok, but more like a Chile's or applebees at a higher price point.
I have been going to this place for about 20 years now and it does appear to be showing it's age.
Bottom line, don't expect to be wowed by gourmet cuisine, but it is very entertaining for little ones.
Our bill usually runs about $100.
Taking the fish out has been a HUGE disappointment
Servers were great! Customer service was great"}
{"text":"We had a great meal and I was very impressed by the service!  If we go again, I need to ask to be seated a bit away from the \"animals\"; they were too loud for me."}
{"text":"This is by far the biggest rip off I can remember. Not only are the decor and animatronic animals totally dated, but between the screaming elephants every 15mins, booming thunder and crying toddlers you can barely talk. The plastic tables are childish and the wait staff is sparse and slow. 


Now, if that is not enough, the food is THE WORST I have ever experienced in a restaurant. I ordered some sort of salad that was supposed to come with seafood and chicken (the description sounded good from the menu). It arrived drenched in a cheap dressing with no seafood and then probably the most embarrassing thing I have ever seen, it was topped with a heap of Hickory Sticks from the bag, and a handful of those cheap Chinese crunch sticks. It was an indelible waste of $18!! 

Oh ya, forgot to mention how ridiculously overpriced they are. They charge $23 for an appetizer that wouldnt fill a child. And they close early too so don't bother coming after 7pm. I honestly don't comprehend how these people stay in business."}
{"text":"I had the most wonderful experience at the rainforest cafe with all the waiters and hostesses being so incredibly animated. Never had such over the top service at a rainforest cafe and I'm from California and go to so many of them out there.  An especially biggest thanks to Mycaiah for making my best friends birthday extra special and making sure she has the most over the top service. I will most definitely stop going to my usual buffets when I come into town just to visit all the new friends I made!"}
{"text":"We have a rain forest cafe close to home and the service has always been great as well as the food so we decided to try this one out. To start we and one other table were the only people in the dining room I should have taken that as a sign. Our server took about 10 minutes to come wait on us by then we were ready to order drinks and food. Then 20-25 minutes went by still no drinks or appetizer was brought but then EVERY thing was brought out at the same time my burger was burned so black I took one bite and didn't eat any more the server wasn't concerned at all. Do not go to this place if your in Vegas so many other amazing places to eat on the strip"}
{"text":"I have two kiddies and they love this place. I however, am not as excited about it as they are. The food was so-so and still more expensive than I would've liked. There's all sorts of \"kid traps\". Light-up glasses and an entire gift shop full of more over-priced items. On the plus side, there's a mechanical crocodile just outside the restaurant. If your kid is young enough, you can always use that crocodile as collateral . . . . . \"If you don't finish your food, that crocodile will get mad\". \"If you don't behave that crocodile is going to come over\". You know, things like that which we may or may not have said to our son. - insert evil grin here-"}
{"text":"really convenient when you are starving after hours of shopping. the decor is great. its a great restaurant for kids because there is so much to look at. it is a bit loud though making it hard to talk to whoever you are with. the food is good. the fries were amazing! i love that they were thinly cut. service was good. they even have a little gift shop too. it was like being at disneyland. =P"}
{"text":"Expensive but to be expected.  It's a kid place and you pay for the atmosphere not the food.  Go for the cobb salad or salmon.  Everything else is eh."}
{"text":"I always eat at the Rainforest café in downtown Disneyland and when they were located inside MGM. This new development is pretty cool. I didn't even know they moved location. 

I came for a birthday party of 30 peoples. The birthday girl decided to sit outside in the patio. The view was so beautiful and sorry to say that's all the positive I can say about this Rainforest café. 

If you are planning to come here, be sure to give yourself 20-30 min walking time.  The hostess told us to park in the Planet Hollywood parking garage. It is sooooooooo far from the restaurant. We then later on found out they have this hidden parking area but its so dark and looks very dangerous to park at.  

OMG it was so freaking hot outside in the patio.  It didn't help when you look over to Twin Peaks (restaurant next door) has they have a mist machine blowing to cool down their customers. 

Customer service was just okay. Nothing special. The food I ordered didn't taste like how I normally order it from other locations. Can't remember the name but it was a pasta dish with Sausage marinara."}
{"text":"Searching for food places we ran across Rainforest cafe. Upon entering we were told they were having happy hour at the bar so off to the bar we went! They had 3 dollar well drinks (you cant beat that) The food on the menu I was too sure about but my husband said order something just try it. Alot of the food sounded full of flavor and spice. In ordered the Steak and potatoes with a side of Caribbean rice. It came out and to my surprise was DELICIOUS!! I scraped my plate."}
{"text":"This had to be one of the best restaurants I've ever been to... The food was great... The waitress was great... And the sang to me know my birthday... The location is right off the strip and the balcony scene was awesome."}
{"text":"I've been here 5 times only because my kids love the atmosphere, but the food is overpriced and not that good and the wait is so long.it takes 10-20 minutes to get a table on a Saturday for lunch, when it's not that busy. 30-45 minutes to get your food. 20 minutes to get your bill. Don't go unless you plan on a 2-3 hour meal."}
{"text":"Atmosphere will blow you away!! Small children will be in awe! Food is over priced, but pretty good. B+"}
{"text":"We needed a quick bite and are fans of the one in Florida. All went well until I bit down on a hard chunk of plastic in my nachos. They took them off the bill but it was still extremely off putting. Nachos were good before that though."}
{"text":"We came with my kids, husband, and my parents for lunch one Friday. 
The decor is fun and does give you the feel of being in a rainforest. However the sounds and thunder/lightening are soooo loud. My 2 year old was terrified and still talks about the \"scary restaurant \". Lol
I ordered the paella. It was delicious, though the rice seemed a bit greasy. Everyone in the party was happy with their food. But it's the prices that get me. It's so overpriced for what you get. 
I probably won't ever come back to the \"scary restaurant \" again. I came, I saw, I was not terribly impressed."}
{"text":"Had lunch here a few days ago and it was great.  Walked in and was seated quickly.  I had the club sandwich and it was very good and just the right portion for a big guy like myself.  Our server was very friendly and checked in on us often which was great.  Kids loved the thunderstorms and monkeys move and make the sounds as well, as it was their first time eating at the Rainforest Cafe."}
{"text":"Well this is the new location that moved from MGM Grand. 

So let me start by saying it's pretty cool everything looks great no more fish tanks. 

The place was empty. Most likely because no one knows it m over and it's possibly the hardest place to locate. I think the holy grail would be easier to find bits outside on the very end on Harmon and lvblvd. At street level it's hard to find.  

Once you find the place assuming you ever do its rain forest just in a smaller package. Staff are friendly and inviting. 

We were seated pretty quick due to the lack of customers. We got our drink orders and food orders pretty quick. Food was \"ok\" my kids got the pizza which they ate all of. I got the awesome sampler it was more like ok sampler but wasn't bad but at 18.99 I expected more. My wife got the rasta pasta again 18.99 We expect more, my dad got the flat iron steak combo. He says the ship was great had to send the steak back because it was rare and he wanted medium, then he got it back they took is sauce. 

I do have to point out the staff was really great and friendly, everyone that passed us enter acted with our boys which is awesome. The manager came out she was fantastic. 

I would recommend trying it out but I think they need to drop the prices a bit.  It's not Disneyland so you can't charge these prices."}
{"text":"We were here last Saturday(Jan02,2016) for dinner to celebrate my kiddo's bff's birthday. First and foremost, Rainforest is geared towards kids and the young at heart. It's not a romantic place to bring a date unless she's into animals roaring every now and then and kids running around.

This new location next to Planet Hollywood seems smaller than their old location at the MGM but still as cool(according to my daughter). Food wise, it's to be expected, nothing special and expensive. Although, the two people in the group who ordered salads were pretty impressed with their food. I had the clam chowder and it was not bad. There was not much in my tiny bowl, a little salty but at least there were clams in there. The kids enjoyed their food and had a lot of fun.

Our server was awesome too. He was pretty busy but very accommodating. If it was not too cold, it would have been nice to sit in their patio/balcony, overlooking the strip.

Here's a tip for those who are planning to go there....DO NOT park at Planet Hollywood and go through Miracle Mile. It's a looooooong walk. Park at Cosmopolitan and take the bridge or pay $5 at the parking lot across the street and take the bridge.

Food and price - 3*
Fun factor for kids - 5*
Service   - 5*"}
{"text":"I was at the Rainforest Cafe at Yorkdale Mall (Toronto, ON) yesterday for a 1 year old's birthday party and it was my 3rd visit, I wouldn't go there on my own accord. It is a fun place for kids, and even adults really since the decor is very unique and kinda neat, if a little on the creepy side (the thunder and animatronic animals made the birthday boy cry). The food is not very good, probably the worst $12.99 quesadillas (appetizer) I've ever had; the pita bread was too thick and the filling was mostly onion with some sauce I couldn't identify. The spinach & artichoke dip was quite tasty. The prices are high, we paid $13.99 for a hamburger (topped with a fried onion ring) with a side of Miss Vickie's potato chips, really? Potato chips as a side?  Not a place you want to go for healthy meals. The service was great, our server even replaced a drink one of the adult guests spilled accidentally, at no charge. The restaurant has been around for over 10 years so obviously the gimmicks and kid-friendly atmosphere make it a winner."}
{"text":"The WORST service I have ever experienced, lazy, rude and just didn't care.  25 minute wait even with a reservation and no one else there waiting! The restaurant was empty and that should have been my red flag to run as fast as I could.  
A restaurant in that location should be top notch and I don't know how they remain open today. 
I have been to many other Rainforest Restaurants including the one at MGM Grand years ago and were very happy. The management and staff all need to be replaced ASAP. 
I am in the hospitality industry and came here because the kids and family were visiting from out of town. 
I will make sure that everyone I know doesn't waste there money or time on this establishment."}
{"text":"I was not impressed. Too expensive. 20 min wait for then sat next to restroom. Too dark to see what i was being served ad pretty noisy. I would not return. Definately not worth the wait nor money. Do not go here! This place is more for looks and not quality."}
{"text":"Drinks were really weak, food took forever to get here, wasnt even that busy, kids runnin around everywhere. Unclean dishes.... Never coming back...

For a touristy place I guess I should of expected this, but for the prices they were asking for... I expected better."}
{"text":"The big pluses are the complete jungle show on the inside and a decent view of New York New York on the strip from its terrace. 

The one expensive glass and cheaper refills are a sham deal - recovering the glasses is pretty hard and you tend to forget about it/not want to return to the cafe after the first experience. 

As everything in Las Vegas, the deserts and drinks are completely crazy in size, sweetness and taste, but the quality isn't that good after all. 

On the downside, the service was very, very bad. We had to wait for extensive amounts of time to be served and to get our cheque, with a lot of things forgotten. The price was also completely jacked up for what this place is worth. 

All in all, I would recommend to look for other places around."}
{"text":"Location not in MGM like it says on Yelp!
It moved near planet Hollywood. New location sucks!  Very tricky to find this place.  Noisy and robotic jungle animals are tacky but worst of all, food is atrocious and overpriced!
They had us wait outside to go upstairs so we thought it was very busy but when we went upstairs there were so many open tables. Only worth one star for the nice waiter."}
{"text":"The staff is so friendly and the place is fun.  The food was pretty good too.   Great view of the strip on the balcony.    Go check this place out.   

Lupe was so friendly.  And the general manager cane to check up on us   Great place"}
{"text":"My family has been going to Rain Forest Cafe for more than 10 years and I can say after our last visit we will not be going back to this location for sure! The service was beyond slow! The wait staff was not kind at all. We were not looking to make friends with the waiter but looking to at least have good service. We asked for a cup of ice water and the waiter bought me a cup with a splash on lemonade with water. The water had a cloudy look and you could clearly taste that there was a water lemonade mix. The waiter wanted to give push back on this drink. All the food that we ordered was horrible. They have changed up the menu and removed a lot of our favorites. We do realize times have changed so the menu has to change but please replace it with foods that are good and makes sure your cooks know what they are doing! Rain Forest in the Mills has gone way down as to why we can no longer visit this location. Maybe they are closing soon"}
{"text":"Came by here earlier this week during a trip to the Sea Life Aquarium. I used to come by many years ago when my other boys were little. I was very disappointed to see that they no longer have fish. They removed the tanks from their dining room and the tanks up front just have bubbles. The fish used to be a highlight of our visits. Our party of three ordered 2 appetizers, the spinach-artichoke dip and barbecue chicken flatbread. The appetizers were very good. I ordered my usual, Volcano Cobb Salad and it still does not disappoint. My youngest son had their kids grilled cheese. My bill with tip was a little over $90. The place is not cheap, the food is good, but I miss the fish."}
{"text":"Not sure why I returned here to eat....oh yeah - the kids wanted to go.   Over priced theme restaurant with slow service (the place is 85% empty) and bad food.  Never again!"}
{"text":"Service was great! Food, omelet and chic salad sandwich were very good and fresh. Sticky table on being seated, slightly high  $ and no fish, not even fake fish. Took out the 5th star."}
{"text":"First of all, for locals - the location sucks!  Its really difficult to get to.  Its is at one of the most busiest and difficult intersections for both pedestrians and cars. 

We parked at the Miracle Mile parking lot which is basically at the back of the property... then walked through and exited the Miracle Mile Mall, then had to go up to the pedestrian bridge to get the Rainforest cafe.  THERE IS NO OTHER WAY TO GET THERE!  The Miracle Mile parking lot is crazy busy.  And there are a lot of \"questionable\" people just hanging around in the parking lot.  Also going up the elevator to get to the pedestrian bridge... ran into a security guard escorting a totally drugged out guy that looked like he was about the heave.  Not exactly what I wanted my kids to see.

So we get there.  There is about a 30 minute wait.  With two restless kids this is tough.  When we finally get seated... half the restaurant is empty!!!  Why the wait?  They were short-staffed, and the kitchen was backed up.  After ordering, food was up after about another 30 minutes.

The food was actually pretty good.  I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich which was excellent.  The fries also good.  Kids meals were decent.  We also ordered some kind of avocado burger which was also pretty good.

The prices though were crazy.  I'm not sure if it was because it was located on the strip, or if it was just because it is a Rainforest Cafe.  The decor is neat... for the first 10 minutes, then it feels mundane.  Between the prices, the wait time, the location... I think I will pass the next time.  There are easier and more convenient places to eat."}

Poor customer service 

*did I mention Poor customer service. Yes it really kills an enjoyable moment. The place was super empty (probably cause it's in Vegas and this is a kid themed place) but not an excuse to hate your job and give rude service. I am a Landry's member and wish all restaurants were more consistent with hiring people that liked their job. Sorry for the rant, but go in for the food and experience, not for wanting your waitstaff to be friendly."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place to take kids to! My 1 year old daughter was fascinated with the thunder storms and animals! 
The food was good, not great. I chose the Rasta Pasta and my husband had a burger. The staff were very friendly and accommodating. The view is wonderful! I would definitely come again...not so much for the food but more for the experience."}
{"text":"We had the pleasure of returning to the Rainforest Cafe and it was great this trip! Great food great service. Atmosphere is always a treat. Enjoyable place for the whole family."}
{"text":"You just never know when or where food poisoning is going to strike next, but I REALLY didn't expect nor appreciate it while I was on a vacation to Las Vegas. On this particular day, my boyfriend and I ate at one restaurant and one restaurant only-because I was busy being violently ill and/or confined to our room for the rest of the trip. And that was this location of Rainforest Cafe. 

The service was fine by our server Doug, the food was subpar, even IF I hadn't gotten sick from it, I wouldn't have repeated the experience again. 

I will say that the management should look into the cleanliness practices of the staff, I ordered a club sandwich and a side of vegetables...nothing risky about that being undercooked, so maybe that is something that could be investigated further? I wouldn't wish the sickness I've experienced on anyone. Much less anyone who's on a long-awaited vacation."}
{"text":"My husband and I came to the Rainforest Cafe for our only day off of work. We planned for a relaxing meal, a fun time at the aquarium and a nice movie to end the day. Unfortunately, to start off our day, I ended up finding a long white hair in my fish. Gross, I know. The manager (I'm assuming) didn't really seem to know what to do and frankly didn't seem to care as he didn't say much. Granted, he did offer a replacement meal and we weren't even sure if we were going to get a discount or something but the waitress (Anisabel) made it all better. She sincerely expressed how sorry she was and surprised us by taking the my whole meal off our check. I was about to be completely livid about the whole situation but Anisabel had given us such superior customer service that I couldn't help but leave content with how the situation was handled. Off to an adventurous day we go!"}
{"text":"Really neat scene for a resteraunt but everything is is separate on the menu so fries will cost you extra with the very expensive on tray.  Foods so so but not worth what you pay for it."}
{"text":"One of the most unorganized chain restaurants I've ever been to. I know not all rainforest cafés are like this... But if you eat here don't think all rainforest cafés are run like this! We (4 guests)went here to celebrate my cousin in laws 10th birthday and I felt that I could have prepared her a better meal at home. The wait was painfully long throughout our entire visit. There wasn't a hostess available to organize seating (about 5 staff members walked by our line and looked away). We waited 15 minutes to get iced water.  The plate was hotter than my food. My meal was warm at best. And we waited another 15 minutes to receive a check for our dinner after multiple requests. I would rather go to the food court next time than to repeat a visit here. Side note... There aren't even fish in their tanks! Sad day."}
{"text":"Came here on a sat afternoon and there was a decent line, so we sat in the bar area. Took a bit for the server to come over, but he was friendly. Ordered the food and that took awhile to come out also. I got the nachos and was very underwhelmed by them. A friend got the pastalaya and wasn't happy with it either. Pretty sure I won't be coming back here for a long while. And I forgot to mention the prices. Ouch."}
{"text":"We usually come here after going to SeaLife in the mall and it makes for a really nice lunch.  We like the food, the service is good....we have never been disappointed.  The atmosphere is the best and also very relaxing.  We like it a lot, not sure we'd go just for that alone, but so long as we go to SeaLife this is our preferred place to eat there."}
{"text":"Rainforest Cafe has been one of my favorite places to go for many years. Yes, it's a little cheesy, but I always thought it was fun. I've been to a handful of locations around the country and the experience has always been generally pleasant. Yes, it's expensive for mediocre food, and the service is generally slow, but I always thought the fun atmosphere made up for that. I especially found the multiple fish tanks compelling. I often insisted on being seated next to one. However, I believe the love affair has ended. I went to the Tempe location last night for my daughter's birthday dinner. I was very surprised and disappointed to find no fish. None at all. Gone. Where there used to be tanks in the dining area are now covered with fake flowers. The huge circular tanks at the entrance and gift shop...now just filled with bubbles. I've seen the animatronic animals dozens of times. It's always the same. The one detail that made every visit different was the fish. Now I really have no compelling reason to ever go back. I asked our server where the fish were. She simply said they were \"transferred\" to the MGM Grand, whatever that means. That's not much of an explanation. Oh well, it was fun while it lasted."}
{"text":"TL;DR over priced food with poor quality.

My daughter loves this place so we only come for her birthday. Went last year to the MGM location and it was decent. Called for reservations, and they could have given me a heads up that they just moved, but didn't. I parked at MGM, went and saw they had moved. Walked to planet Hollywood. When you walk in, it feels super crowded with all the gift shop items. There's not a clear sign on how to get to the restaurant. Walking up those stairs feels a bit tight.

Two in my party ordered burgers. The meat was dried out and overcooked. The buns also tasted like they sat under a heat lamp for way too long. For a $250 meal, we were not satisfied at all. Don't bother going, unless you just want the flashing lights and loud animals."}
{"text":"I liked this place, the food was ok, alcoholic beverages were big & tasty! The atmosphere is loud because it's a very kid friendly place. I think it is a cool concept for a restaurant but it could be done better      

I will probably be going back now that my hubby & I have a toddler I'm sure he will love it. 

Overall, if you take the kids & have a drink or two you'll have a great time!"}
{"text":"Right out the gate this is only getting 3 stars cause of steven he help us when our server never showed up i would not come back here Phoenix has so much to offer in the way of great dinning and themed restaurants you can find a better way to spen your money"}
{"text":"If you go to Rainforest Cafe, you are not going for a good meal. You are going because you have some children with you who you want to impress at the elaborately decorated restaurant with moving robot-animals.

That is pretty much Rainforest Cafe's only high-point, but it's a big one. It has a great wow factor that children love. All the servers are dressed in safari gear. There are moving monkeys, elephants, snakes, birds, and more along the walls. Giant aquariums with beautiful fish and a grand fountain are a great sight to see. Every half hour, a simulated thunder storm occurs where the lights flicker and you begin to hear thunder (which was actually a little frightening for the two-year-old we were with).

The food was probably some of the worst I've had at any restaurant. I had the steak and shrimp combo and the steak was incredibly bland and chewy, lacking any flavour except the burnt charcoal still attached to it. The vegetables and mashed potatoes just tasted off somehow. The shrimp was okay but nothing to write home about.

Because of all the animal noises and the waterfall, it's very difficult to try and have conversations with anyone. Additionally, every 5 minutes or so you hear a server shouting \"VOOOOLCAAANNOOOOO\" as they rush out with a Volcano dessert (which is actually quite good). Speaking of the servers, none of them seem happy to be there serving you at all.

Bottom-line, this is a great place to take kids for the wow factor, but don't expect to at least enjoy your meal or the service while you are there. Save your money and snack on the appetizers, the overpriced bland meals aren't worth it."}
{"text":"Food was decent, as was staff. Nothing really noteworthy. Same as every other rainforest cafe."}

The ambiance is worth five stars on it's own!  the hostess was exceptional.  my mahi mani was great (a little dry) but the shrimp with it was perfect.  the hamburger we had with it was ok, looked great but could have been hotter.  the fries were old and cold but the server corrected it when asked.  strawberry lemonade was awesome!  my biggest complaint was the inattentive server.  she wasn't rude just never there."}
{"text":"Fun environment. Liked all the interactive animals and sound effects. Food was...eh- nothing out of the ordinary. The cost was more expensive but then the scenery was better. The Agave drink they have there is awesome! :0)"}
{"text":"The food was okay  I didn't go here with high expectations ! 

My kids loved it tho and the atmosphere is perfect for the little humans ! 

Last time I went to rainforest cafe was over 15 yrs ago . So I was happy to experience it with my kids ! 

Service was standard and like I said we don't come for the food we came for the experience ."}
{"text":"Neat place to take kids for the atmosphere. But...it's really over priced for the quality if food and the amount of time the food took to come out. Food was bland and my pasta was cold by the time it got to the table. Service was ok I guess."}
{"text":"1.) When I go to a restaurant with a friend and our two children I do not like to be confronted at our table by a man with a handwritten cardboard sign and a box of candy bars. The gentleman never spoke and roamed the restaurant approaching at least 8 or 9 tables. He had a drink at a table along with an awful lot of supplies. 

I had noticed him before he approached the table because he was an adult male eating alone in what is a restaurant for basically children.

2.) Why does it take over an hour to get 2 burgers and 2  children's meals when there are only 11 tables occupied?

3.) They took 2 of the silver ware off the table. When the 2 children's meals came, they didn't bring any napkins for the kids. I asked for some and was told they would bring them.  We never received them. 

4.) Costly food. Mediocre service. I guess you are paying for the ambiance but to me, it's so loud and needs a deep cleaning."}
{"text":"I have been to the Rainforest cafe in MN before and thought this would be the same. A lot of stuff is broken-no fish in the fish tanks, no movement from the characters that are on the walls, dark lights-nasty floor, etc. The food was ok but very expensive for what you got. It cost us over $100 for a family with 2 littles. YIKES!"}
{"text":"Last night I brought my family, who flew into Phoenix the night before, to Rainforest Café.  I thought it would be perfect for the 8 year old with us because of the atmosphere.  What an embarrassing experience.  After placing our order, we waited an entire hour before getting up and leaving the restaurant (without any signs of our food).  The restaurant had three other tables going, that's it.  Our server checked on us ONCE after 45 minutes to say \"it will be 5-10 more minutes, I will put my best guys on it.\" Little did we know the last laugh was at our expense. Prior to leaving I asked to speak to a manager.  Waited another 10 minutes for a manager to show up, and they could not even figure that out.

There's really no wonder this restaurant, as a chain, has lost its relevance in the last ten years. We had 10 people with us--and with their prices that means at least $200 walked out the door with us. I was horrified to tell my guests, \"we should just go get a bag of burgers because this is ridiculous.\"  Sure, go for the atmosphere, but do not expect any kind of service.  FYI that was my first time \"walking out\" of a restaurant in my entire life. Embarrassing and pathetic."}
{"text":"The Rainforest Cafe in Tennessee had to close down because the place flooded.   If that's not proof of an angry God, I'm not sure what is.

There's nothing like eating formerly-live animals in an animatronic museum to their future demise.

Prices are high, but someone has to subsidize the robotics.

Food is ho-hum, but it's hard to keep your mouth closed when you're so awed by the miracles of modern science and technology."}
{"text":"Upon arrival at hostess podium there was an older gentlemen who was not very attentive nor cared about seating our group, even after we asked twice about being seated. We were the only ones there so he clearly just didn't care. Went to PBR instead and had a blast."}
{"text":"I didn't even get to try the food here. The restaurant was completely empty and we were told  needed to wake up our disabled baby to remove her from her stroller because strollers aren't allowed. I suggested just pushing her into the corner next to our table. Our waitress with a straight face said someone might get seated at the table next to us IN AN EMPTY RESTAURANT! DISGUSTING"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere but that is it, food is poor, service was poor until they found out we were Landry card holders."}
{"text":"Went there for my son's 10th birthday party.  Ordered BBQ chicken wrap and my son ordered cheeseburger sliders.  Our waitress didn't return for 30 minutes.  Our food took 40 minutes to arrive and the chicken tasted like it was canned and they used cheap sauce.  My son's sliders tasted extremely dry and not very good.  Very disappointed for my son.  When I said something to the manager she said that is standard for the kitchen.  Needless to say I won't be going back."}
{"text":"The Rainforest Café is just a gimmicky restaurant but it's a fun place.  During your meal, the animals along the edges come to life.  In the middle of the restaurant are visible stars of the night.  The different animals make noises, moves and the restaurant is alive.  Our waiter was attentive.  I ordered a sandwich and my daughter ordered from the child's menu.  My sandwich was ok but my daughter's pizza looked like a frozen pizza that was heated up.  Nothing special about the kid's menu.  She had the fruit, which was a handful of grapes and I had the fries.  Our waiter came and refilled our drinks.  We went before the dinner rush.  It wasn't crowded when we went for dinner and we were able to get a table pretty quickly.  I did notice that there was a waiting room full of people when we were leaving.  The downstairs is the giftshop.  I do like the alligator (or is it crocodile?) in the \"swampy\" area as you walk in.

Given the choice, don't sit outside.  Sit inside.  For the most part, you're paying for the rainforest experience and you'll miss out on it if you sit outside.  You're not coming to this restaurant for the food."}
{"text":"Meh. Overpriced, sub-par food with some cheesy animatronics of gorillas and elephants. If you have kids I guess it's worth a one-time visit for the experience. But the place is noisy, the staff is not very attentive, and man the prices. You'll pay $15 for a hamburger- and that's probably the cheapest item on the menu. We walked out spending $75 for 2 adults and a toddler, which is just insane to me. You have to walk through the gift shop on the way out- more ways to spend money!!"}
{"text":"I came here with my family for a first time experience for our little ones. They seat us almost in the middle and close to the exit (no where close to the animals even though there were two tables close to the elephants and one by the monkeys). We were told that they waitress in that area was not willing to take more tables. So we got a crappy seat :(  

Next: our waitress was nice and attentive and came by often to ask us about refills. But when I ask for a Long Island ice tea, I was told that she wasn't sure if they were going to be able to make it and if they did there would be an extra charge (not sure for what). When I got the drink the drink was water down and not tasty at all. She took it back and brought me a new one! Very nice of her but it's still nasty. 

In general our food was good but very pricey and were charge for every single condiments that probably measure a tea spoon at max. The food was ok and the presentation of it was ok also. But I will most likely not comeback and spend $180 in dinner."}
{"text":"I took my grandkids there last week and they loved it!  The food I thought was good for the price and the kids ate everything.  The best part of our whole experience was the face painter that was there, the kids absolutely loved her and what a great job she did.  We will definitely be back....."}
{"text":"Three stars for the atmosphere. Lines are long for no apparent reason, but it is really nice and exciting. Sometimes the kiddos get scared because of the life like sounds and animals in the \"jungle\", but they love it! I only go here for my kids because the food you can get at Applebee's for half the price. It's not awful food, it's just food you can buy in the freezer section and heat up at home. Also the bathrooms are disgusting. I understand being busy and understaffed, but there is no reason to be serving food and have a bathroom looking like that."}
{"text":"We just got done having a quick dinner here. Our server Tina was absolutely amazing and answered all my questions I had about the salads on the menu. Thanks for having us! Although I think this place is a little more family oriented with all the fake wildlife the salads were so good."}
{"text":"I've never had a meal worth having at Rainforest Cafe so when my boyfriend was insistent that the lava brownie explosion thing (his words) was the best dessert on the strip, I'll admit I was skeptical. 

We arrived late on a Monday and went upstairs. The hostess was gone and a few different employees assured us she'd be back shortly. She did come back a few minutes later and was incredibly friendly! We were seated and waited. And waited. And waited. And waited. 

Eventually, someone stops by to ask if we've had our drink orders taken and we advised them that no, we haven't, and we just wanted dessert. The guy comes back a few minutes later and we order the dessert my boyfriend was insistent about, an ice cream sandwich, and a bowl of ice cream. 

And then we waited. For an insanely long time. 

Eventually we got our desserts (and my daughter was sung happy birthday, which made her day so that was nice). My boyfriend and I split the monstrosity that he ordered and - unsurprisingly - it was not very good. The brownies were cold and tasted a bit stale and the ice cream was a bit frost bitten. 

At the end of the meal our server said something about our gift card having a zero balance but we didn't really understand what he was talking about as our receipt showed that our gift card balance was $25. The total cost for our dessert was over $20 so we tipped them up to $25 and left hoping to never return. 

Kids enjoyed it and have plotted our return next time we visit.... but I'm hoping we can talk them into something higher quality and delicious."}
{"text":"No gluten free menu & a little overpriced... My friends son loved the environment.
The food took a very long time around the end of lunch time... 
Besides that, the server was pleasant. Food was good. Had the chicken sandwich and it was kind of dry"}
{"text":"We had a great experience yesterday. Our server was great and the food was delicious and plentiful. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that it's VERY pricey compared to same type/quality restaurants. And, the bathroom was tiny. With babies to change, it was so hard to fit. I got bumped into like 5 times with people coming in and out which is hard with a little baby. 
Will come back."}
{"text":"Good breakfast.  The service was terrific.  Traci treated us like family.  While traveling it's nice to feel at home."}
{"text":"I had the Mayan mushroom ravioli very good. The lobster sauce put it over the top."}
{"text":"3 because of the environment/staff not the food. The food is so so. The reason I give this a three is because it was so loud in there my kids could yell and I didnt care. the staff was very attentive, courteous, and quick to keep the drinks filled and fulfill requests for dips and dressings."}
{"text":"Been to Rainforests in Chicago and Florida and while this has the appearance, the food was mediocre and service worse. Hostess not accommodating with which open table to sit at. Waiter was inexperienced. Food was so so. Had coupon for appetizer that they wouldn't fully honor for grub they buy in bulk from a food service company and then microwave. The only thing memorable is remembering to never go back."}
{"text":"This place was a laugh!.....in a good way.....we had just ordered when a simulated lighting storm occurred....the lights were flashing, thunder was booming and all of the animatronics were screeching......We just had to try this place as I had never experienced anything like this in Australia....the restaurant came complete with a night sky with twinkling stars, a fog machine around the bar, huge tropical fish tanks and bar stools in the shape of animal rears and feet!.....Our waitress was great.....and the food was good.....we did not expect 5 star dining as clearly this is the last place you would go if you were feeling 5 star....it is essentially for children but we had fun as we still have a lot of child in us. My husband had the coconut shrimp which was actually very good and I had the English style fish and chips which I have to say was not very English but the fish was very tasty. Great for a casual bite and to entertain the children......not sure if you want to take very young young children here though as it can get quite noisy and some of the very young ones looked quite concerned!"}
{"text":"Server was high - asked us if we were ready for dessert after our starters   When we asked them about our main meal he insisted we never placed an order. Was actually arguing with us and finally went back to the kitchen and realized we did place an order didn't get my order correct so I sent it back and asked to be removed from my check our whole check should've been comped. Was a horrible experience"}
{"text":"Something different, good food , thunder, monkeys nice place. Long walk from the parking garage but worth it. Enjoyed the Miracle mile mall ."}
{"text":"My daughter decided that she wanted to come to the Rainforest Cafe for her 11th Birthday. We arrived close to 5 pm on a week night and it wasn't very busy. The atmosphere was super fun and kept the kids busy looking around. We ordered an appetizer and the drinks first and received them pretty quickly.  The thunder storms reminded us of the Midwest. Our food arrived in a fair amount of time and we all left full. If you are looking for a fun place to eat with your kidos and are ok w some noise this is the place to go!!!!"}
{"text":"Mayra was out server. Was excellent . Had steak & shrimp Girls had burger fries. Food was good . Prices where what I thought where fair"}
{"text":"The old location of this Rainforest Cafe used to be inside the MGM. Now, it has moved over to the Planet Hollywood! I loved this place as a child, and a few friends were visiting with their kids so we decided to bring them to the jungle!

The jungle environment is very unique and fun. It will be the place that creates great memories for children, as it is detailed with trees and rainforest creatures. 

The food is consistent at Rainforest Cafe. No complaints there. My complaint lies with how long we waited for our food and how the server forgot about a few of our orders."}
{"text":"Our waiter Alberto was awesome however kitchen got my daughter in law order wrong. I felt the manager should have comped her meal for the inconvenience considering the wait. Also they added mushrooms to her burger which she hates, but she just gave us $5.00 off of a bill that was $163.00! Her meal was $16.99, the wait was long. My 2 year old grandson was scared of the apes, but other than that it was good. My rice was dry!!!"}
{"text":"My son loves this place. Everytime we walk by it in Yorkdale Mall we have to go see the fish and the crocodile...so we decided to go for dinner. Big mistake, the food is absolutely horrible and is so overpriced you will be amazed. 
We ordered the following and you will understand why the pricing is so off for substandard probably all frozen prepackaged food

Burger 12.99 (you have to pay an additional .99 for fries)
Starter Sampler 16.99 (stuff that was totally frozen 10 minutes before you got it!!!!)
Frozen Rasberry Lemonade 5.99 (what was I thinking!!!)

It was really too much for the food they offered, I think you are paying more for the atmosphere, which if you want they let you enjoy anyways!!! Just go and walk around dont bother ordering anything!"}
{"text":"This place was inside of a mall I believe so I was just going to walk by and find something else on the strip but the setting caught my eye it was so nice. The restaurant really gave off a rainforest vibe. The food was sooo delicious and my family and I went at happy hour so we tried a little of everything . The happy hour prices were really good I am talking 6$ 7$ small meals, overall I highly recommend this place and the customer service was good."}
{"text":"Okay first off, its a fun themed kids place to eat. You go for more than the food. Mainly to see the look on your kids face when the animals come to life. The aquariums are great as well. As for the food, I think it has improved in quality from previous times.
The one drink I got was very weak, nearly no alcohol for 12 bucks, so I would complain about that. The food in general was tasty but 4 people ate for 125.00, bit expensive if you ask me. But again it's an experience. My advice for keeping it a bit cheaper would be to share a burger $10-$15. The kids meals are about $6, but the optional drink cup will cost you an additional $8. It adds up quick."}
{"text":"Very interesting restaurant. Great place for family with little kids. Not sure how I feel about the ambiance. It's very cool at first, but the darkness actually makes me very tired and its hard to see the menu and such. I think they need to have more strategic lighting. The occasional thunderstorm is going over the top. The fish tank at the front entrance is pretty, I wish it was bigger, but then I guess it won't be a rain forest. 

The food is pretty good. I only got appetizers and it was just enough for lunch. The only downside is the above-average price. The drinks are pretty nice too."}
{"text":"This place is soooo fun for kids. My sons in awe with all of the animals that move every 10min. The food good too. Had the coconut shrimp Wes had some little hamburgers with potato salad. Fun atmosphere"}
{"text":"This is only good to go to if you have kids.  Food is overpriced and they sure like to add too much pepper and believe its called flavor.  Only good thing is the atmosphere."}
{"text":"When we went last week, the women's bathroom was dirty and needed maintenance. Besides ourselves, there was only one other family being served. It took more than half an hour to receive our food. My order included a steak which was made well done when I asked for medium well. Also, I had to ask for a steak knife, since I wasn't given one with my steak. Overall, we received disappointing service."}
{"text":"Great for kids. But as a women in my twenties, I like to hear the person sitting next to me, not a mechanical monkey or faux rainstorm. Food is a little pricey. Everyone I have gone it takes forever to Recieve my food.  I love the giant fish tanks.  Fun unique dining experience, I guess I grew out of it."}
{"text":"This atmosphere is like that of no other! It's so calming and unique; there's décor and sounds just like that of a Rainforest! The food is exquisite and there's even a magician that comes around to each table and entertains folks! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Lousy customer service nobody there to seat you or get your name on a list. They most horrific experience. Recommend you go some where else"}
{"text":"now here is a place that is need to be written on your go to do list, its a fun and enjoyable restaurant loud as can be with the animal noise form and ape to birds, you will just love it, and also the kids if you have any, family to. 
I also enjoy when you have to way at the bar and you sitting in some chair that look like animal legs how funny is that. 
I tell you, this is a place to stop by if you are out at Toronto."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool. We stopped by here really quick on our way out of the mall and decided to grab a drink and a snack. I have been here before but it's been a few years, so I was excited to try it again. I love the way this place is decorated. It's all decked out as if you were in the rainforest. Huge fish tanks, vines, leaves, trees, bushes, rain, even animatronics animals. It's quite the place! We sat at the bar and their barstools are actually formed into different animals, which is a very cool idea. We decided on a few drinks and ended up ordering an appetizer to share. The cheese sticks we had were very good! Nice and crispy on the outside and the cheese was warm and gooey on the inside. The marinara had a lot of kick to it. It's a really basic dish, but I can't tell you how many places I have been to where the cheese sticks are hard, the cheese isn't melted or gooey and marinara taste like watered down tomato soup!

The staff was very friendly; the atmosphere was really cool, it was a nice place to grab a quick bite! I can't wait to come back and try a main dish and sit back in the restaurant where all the action (animatronics) are!"}
{"text":"Truly awful breakfast, couldn't get much worse, though Randy was very nice waiter. Otherwise you're better off at McD's, unless of course you like the simulated sounds of a dumbass fake rain forest complete with vicious storm sounds and exotic birds -- which would probably taste better to eat than this crap!

Did have great burger at Bobby Flay's."}
{"text":"Had a really fun time, and unique enviornment!  Good food"}
{"text":"Two stars for the food only, which was the saving grace of our lunch experience. We got seated relatively quickly, but then waited over 5 minutes (long enough for us to look over the menu, argue, then decide what to eat for our party of 7) until we were greeted by our waitress (Danchelle) who was full of personality (yes, that's sarcasm at its finest).  She may have been perturbed by a comment that she overheard by one in our party along the lines of \"this is taking forever, we might be leaving.\"  Meanwhile, a table behind us must have felt the same way as they up and left without so much as talking to anyone. From then on, our server was short, discourteous, and overly not friendly. When the food finally came out, it was just decent, nothing to write home about. The patronizing attitude from our server throughout the rest of our meal pretty much killed the experience. Luckily our kids loved the \"thunder/lightening\" storms. Toward then end of the meal, our server began clearing plates and pre-busing, without saying much other than, \"can I get you anything?\"  Each time we politely replied \"no thanks.\"  We waited...and waited...and finally asked for our bill. She had it right with her and dropped it immediately. It was paid and when she brought it back, again with a patronizing tone, said, \"I didn't drop your bill earlier because some people like to order coffee and stuff, but I had it right here the whole time.\"  Well, newsflash, we didn't ask for anything when you offered and you didn't mention anything about coffee or desert when clearing plates and pre-busing.  We will never return to this particular Rainforest Cafe. And I suggest bringing a lot of patience and ability to be talked down to with you if you decide to go."}
{"text":"I have been to the Rainforest Cafe quite a few times over the years and it's never that good. The hostess was creepy. Lol She got into our bubble of space to ask how many for our table. We both sort of stepped back and she stepped forward. She needs to learn space boundaries. We got to our table and ordered. Our sever was a bit obnoxious, nothing in particular, he was just kind of annoying. The food was blah. The menu itself is boring and like any other boring restaurant. You'd think that they'd have more fun or exotic recipes being that it's the Rainforest Cafe but nope, they had a few sandwiches, some salads, a few burgers, some fish items, etc... pretty boring. If it hadn't been for the free gift card we had we probably wouldn't be back. Go elsewhere. There are plenty of places that are far better. Rainforest Cafe is more interested in the environment they provide than the food they serve."}
{"text":"Being on the Las Vegas strip and looking for a kid-friendly dinner spot, I was willing to give this place a try.  
I got a shrimp platter and my wife got some type of oriental chicken salad.  My shrimp were awful (the coconut shrimp looked grey and unsafe to eat) and the salad was not much better.

On the plus side, my kids did enjoy the restaurant's decorations & theme, so it wasn't a complete loss, but do not go here for the food.  I saw quite a few tables with adults that came here without kids.  I think you'd need to be nuts to come here without kids--I'd rather eat fast food."}
{"text":"This place is seriously ridiculous. Never coming a back here again and I wouldn't recommend this location to anyone. It's not even that busy and we still have to wait literally almost an hour just for our food. The people who were seated after us even got there food first and we only have 5 people. We mainly just got appetizers and a kids menu. Our waitress was really nice and sweet but seriously never coming back here!"}
{"text":"This place gets 5 stars for atmosphere and it is a favorite of my children for that reason.  However, the service always seems to be lacking in one way or another.  The food is ok and overpriced for what you get.  But, due to the fun environment, we will keep going back."}
{"text":"Service was exceptional they impressed me at this location I think a lot of restaurants locations could learn from this restaurant so again thank you and awesome work that shows a management that knows how to lead a team."}
{"text":"I was in the area and decided to have dinner and it was nearby and I hadn't been there in years. The restaurants display was awesome and just like I remember as a child. Waitress was really nice. Food was delicious a little pricy but the restrooms need some work."}
{"text":"First time dining here since the MGM location closed. Stairway to the third floor is pretty great. It looks like a real rainforest with animals all over the place. The staff is friendly. I happen to be here for a Thanksgiving lunch and they had a Thanksgiving special plate with turkey, mashed potatoes, green beans, stuffing and cranberry sauce. When that's done, you get a slice of pumpkin pie. Everything for $22, well worth it. Huge plate, truly stuffs you like a turkey. The view is great on the patio. Drinks are a bit expensive, but considering it's on the strip, it makes sense."}
{"text":"rainforest cafe used to be a fun  and special experience with huge fish tanks, thunderstorms, and outgoing staff. We used to take our kids here for special occasions, paying a bit too much for \"just ok\" food because the experience was great. 

Now the aquariums have all been taken down, the fish have been taken out of the entry way tanks, the restaurant is empty, and the poor staff just seems like they understand that they are at a dying place. 

It's sad; Rainforest Cafe seems like they have mailed it in and are just waiting to die. We had come regularly for almost two decades; now i don't think we will be back"}
{"text":"Came to Las Vegas for a Color guard competition. Whole group went out to dinner here. Had yo order from the group menu at  $30 per person.  This is a fun decorated place and has animated animals and lighting/sounds of \"weather\". Food was good and hot. Prices are a little much, but hey, its Las Vegas and on the Strip."}
{"text":"Jimmy was our server, he did an awesome job. The food was fantastic, the atmosphere was great, and the prices was not to shabby.. definitely a place I would recommend to friends and family."}
{"text":"I really like this place! Every time I'm in Las Vegas, I make sure to stop by. The service is great and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"this place wasnt too bad. food was good but a lil expensive. the decoratins,animals, sounds etc werent as spectacular as i had seen online. its a small place. its a good place to go once or take kids to look around while eating but i wasnt too impressed. the staff was very nice though"}
{"text":"Much better than I expected. I stopped here with family while we were on the strip and needed a child friendly restaurant indeed I was not expecting too much but I was actually impressed that the food was better than expected. I wouldn't have come here without a family with children to eat by myself.  However I will recommend it to families with children their father himself from the strip and need and entertaining environment along with better-than-expected food for a theme styled restaurant."}
{"text":"Hostess was an old, rude white lady who wouldn't seat us cause we had our swimsuits on. We had just come from a pool party. Mind you, we had dresses and cover ups over us so you couldn't even see anything. We were starving and decided to go somewhere else where they had no problem seating us. Would not recommend and will never return."}
{"text":"I was a hotel restaurant manager for twenty years, and this location's staffing and food were appalling.
You can't blame the clueless young people who work there, as it was obvious that they've had  zero training. 
This mess falls squarely on the shoulders of lazy and incompetent management....in both the front and back of the house.

I frankly didn't want to sit down in this restaurant, as it reminded me of a seedy, darkened movie theater where heaven only knows what's crawling on the floor and presumably on everything else.
We were seated in a booth at a sticky table, and sure enough, there were food remnants on the greasy seats; even an entire half of what looked like a very ancient grilled cheese sandwich.
I would've left had it not been for my granddaughter, who was thrilled at seeing the elephants. (hence, the 1 star) 
We waited forever to be greeted by a server, even though at 5 p.m. there were only 3 other parties seated; one party of 5 children and 2 adults, and two parties of 2.

If the front of the house is this bad, then you have to wonder if the kitchen management is equally lacking.
Guess what? It is.
I thought it'd be safe to order a salad. Think again! The lettuce was warm and limp and sitting in puddle of watery dressing w/ zero flavor. I would bet my life that the chicken, which topped the 'salad', came from a can; slithery, rubbery and with a sickening, plastic sheen. 
I actually shuddered when I saw it.
If you can't grill a chicken breast - please take it OFF the menu.

This place needs an overhaul, big time."}
{"text":"Visited the MGM location many years ago; received less than sub-par service, beginning with the host/hostess stand, continuing onto the wait staff and management.  Never again."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink before heading home. Took a seat in bar, waited for service, after 15 minutes got up and left. The place looked empty at 4:00 pm on a Thursday. I guess they don't need the business."}
{"text":"Sadly after dining here today I am taking away a star. My son loves it here and that is the only reason we come back.  
Again... we informed everyone that my daughter and I are gluten free ( not my choice). I ordered the salmon with rice and lentils. It was very flavorful but my rice was dry and almost undercooked. The lentils could cook a little longer as well. My daughter ordered the Quinoa pasta and added chicken.  Her meal came out with a huge chunk of bread on it! The bread was not gluten free and thankfully we didn't assume it was. 
Our server was new and it was obvious. In time I hope she works the kinks out."}
{"text":"After waiting in line. For 20 minutes watching hostess fold paper hats while line went from the hostess station out to mall entrance approx 40 feet many people walked out of the line noticing that 25 tables were  vacant and clean told hostess that 12 people left the line to go elsewere. Her attitude was of a ooh well response.  Our sever was prompt and was helpful. Manager has been called to 3 tables so far we .  we ordered philly cheese steak and a rainforest burger with a side of mozzarella sticks.. Our mozzarella sticks were awesome its been 40 minutes and no burger or sandwich wow. 
  Finally the food arrives looks good fries crisp burger cold wifes philly is ok. Corey our server was great made this experience worth the trip."}
{"text":"I don't see why they would have a full bar when this is really more of the children typesetting, very high-priced small selection of food."}
{"text":"I wish I read the reviews before we went.  It is overpriced, mediocre food.  I got a \"wrap\" that was institutionalized and tasteless.  Server didn't even notice when he removed the 3/4 of the uneaten thing from me.  We weren't offered boxes for the kid's food.  The drinks were OK but not good enough to get me to go back.

Side note - I find it ironic that a place that is built for kids goes and scares the crap out of them every 20 minutes with a thunder storm.  I think my kid is scared for life.

$100 for lunch.   Jeez."}
{"text":"Okay, before I go into this review, when you go to Rainforest you are not going for the great food or for an economical and filling meal, because you will get none of that. The food is good, but not outstanding. It is not economical and you will likely leave looking for something else unless you order an overpriced appetizer. It's basically like high end amusement park fare. Sure it's entertaining that the animatronics and the simulated downpour every 10-15 minutes is fun but if I'm going to pay close to 50.00 for two people to eat, I expect they we should not be looking for something else afterward. Okay so that out of the way...  We have one of these close to home that we don't go to, but we are on vacation and just got a gift card from the timeshare people for sitting through their presentation so we really had nothing to lose here  The food is actually good, there just isn't very much of it. My wife and I each ordered the Mojo Bones which is St Louis style ribs we ordered the half rack because the price on the full rack was clearly out of the question. It came with Cole Slaw and Fries. The Cole Slaw was tiny and the fries were good but not many of them. So on novelty I give it a five on value I give it a one on food I give it a three so then the average is three. On a side note we probably would not have tried it if we didn't get a gift card for sitting through a time share presentation. Novel yes, but personally for ribs I'll go to Chicago for Ribs."}
{"text":"i overall like the place. i usually get the same two things on the menu because i love them!:P only complaint i have about this place is i refuse to sit by the 
waterfall\" area. its waaayyyy too loud you have to yell to even hear each other and u get wet lol. so besides that even though some of the decorations are a bit corny i still enjoy it. except the past few times we have gone  the gorillas and elephants werent even coming on which was a bummer. weve never had problems with the service though and i love looking at the fish tanks. they should take the water part out and put more tanks:p"}
{"text":"Long wait for frozen food with high prices. Took my son for his birthday and mentioned it the way in. Zero acknowledgement of his special day. Will never go here again."}
{"text":"Put on a 20 min wait and there are many seats and lots of staff. Not sure why there is a wait. Came for the atmosphere for kiddos, hoping food is fast."}
{"text":"If i could give negative stars i would. From start to finish it was horrible. It was my nieces birthday so before they arrived i let the hostess know we had a birthday girl, that we wanted to add the volcano dessert. when we were finally seated they took almost 20 mins to ask us for our drinks. my brother in laws mojito had zero amount of alcohol. the waiter gave him an attitude rolled his eyes and then replaced it. we asked the birthday girl what she wanted to order. the waiter snapped and said i can just come back and started walking away. we had to call him back because we were already ready he just couldnt wait for two seconds for the little girl to order. He got my sisters salad wrong but she ate it anyways since we had already been waiting for so long. then he brings us the check. so we reminded him about the birthday dessert that we wanted to surprise my niece with. which now the surprise was ruined. so for every other birthday at other tables over 6 or more waiters would go sing. when they came to our table it was our waiter and one other. please dont go here!!! unless you like over expensive food and getting treated like garbage"}
{"text":"Lame. Way lame. Interior is still from 1992. There is no atmosphere just a cheesy decorations. Very disappointed. Is was way better at mgm."}
{"text":"This place blew!  I took my daughter here for her birthday since she's constantly bugging me to go.  The only thing good about this place is the decor and the \"thunderstorms\" complete with animatronic rainforest creatures.  We waited 30 minutes to be seated...and we HAD a reservation.  Then, another 20 minutes for a server to bring us menus, then another 10 minutes to place drink orders!  The wait staff was rude and non-commital, the waitress told my daughter to \"stop being so picky\"..?!?..I watched 2 younger kids have freak outs when the thunderstorm started, whereupon our server felt it was okay to tell this 7 yr old boy to \"grow up and get a pair\"...!?! We ended up walking out without finishing our meals, which, btw, was disgusting.  We will never go back."}
{"text":"I'm not telling you to visit here for the food. Infact don't bother with any of the mains. Stick to the drinks and the appys and go in for the pure ecstasy on your child's face.
As soon as we entered the cafe I was reminded of being on holiday. Think Universal Studios, Epcot Centre... very theme park like with a sense of adventure and excitement. The space is huge and with a true rainforest feel has plenty to arouse the senses. Large fish tanks, trees with giant fruits, near life sized animals, serpents and reptiles are staged throughout. Go for the ambiance. Which is what I'm assuming the two couples I saw on a date were doing, because I don't understand why childless beings would want to dine there. Let alone have steak!



We sat by the elephants and would do so again but there's plenty of other animals to sit by that will captivate the young ones. I was not expecting the pure joy that two stampeding (yet stationary) mechanical elephants would bring every twenty minutes or so. Mind you it can get loud but being a city girl the Little Monkey was not phased by the loud noises in the least bit. Instead she was jumping for joy and squealing in delight as she stood mesmerized. \"

 I had the Oreo Milkshake because being pregnant gives me the right to have that. Justified. The burger was mediocre at best and I would highly recommend NOT getting it. I hear the Fajitas are okay but in all honesty the appys looked better and were a bit more reasonable in price, though I still don't expect them to be anything more than sub-par  I'd say stick to the drinks (they have a well stocked bar) and some nibbles whilst your little ones explore the area. Better yet.. vino and dessert might be your best bet. Service was extremely friendly and they didn't mind the kids running around but don't expect speedy service. Even if the cafe is empty, it will take about ten minutes to get you seated and there's no rush to get you out the door either.

Go for the thrill of jungle adventures, experiencing Jumaji in real life, the excitement of thunderstorms and the innocent smiles on your lil one's face."}
{"text":"Was in the mall shopping for some things so we stopped in being that it was my daughters first time, the atmosphere was neat and my daughter absolutely loved all the animals and asked to sit by the waterfall they hostess sat us right next to it so that was great! It was steady our waiter was great and he was attentive and never let our drinks get empty and checked in with us often. I will tell you I was disappointed with the food! The three stars are for our waiter who was on top of all of it but for the $80 I paid for dinner for 2.5 people It just seemed to fall short. The prices were a bit high I just assumed that everything would be great and it wasn't. I'll probably never come back, waiter was atmosphere the food ! It's a shame because I had heard so many good things about this place !"}
{"text":"Super slow service.  They had more workers than patrons and workers were just talking and walking around.  We had a party of 11 and only one waiter.  No help from other workers.  Had to stop another waiter to ask where our waiter was after he went missing for 20 mins.  We didn't even order our food yet.  Waiter comes and brings drinks, then we wait another 45 mins for food.  After food comes , he's missing one order, so that person waits another 15 mins.  They need better management here. Visit on 09/07/16."}
{"text":"I'm usually not this harsh and can typically find something to like about a place but our experience was just not good. First, there was a huge line. I guess this is typical and I almost wonder if it's some ploy to make the place look more busy than it is. 

Anyways, we get seated finally and we're in the corner. A round table and with no view of pretty much anything. Kids could hear the elephants but didn't get to see squat. To make it worse, the stupid table wasn't positioned well so basically, we had to wedge it against the other end of the simi-circle to even get in. 

App were okay but the spinach artichoke dip was so overcooked it was nearly hard.

Got the main food and disappointing doesn't even cover my dish. Blacken tilapia w/ mango salsa. The salsa was so bland and did nothing for the poor tasting fish. Shrimp and scallops in cheese sauce. So if you're like me, maybe you're expecting a white cheese. Nope. American. Like Velveeta. Over the tiniest shrimp and scallops I've ever seen. Only saving grace was the coconut shrimp. They actually tasted good. Oh and the mashed potatoes but if you can mess those up, you deserved to be flogged.

Now at this point I think, whatever. Maybe I just got the wrong meal. Granted it was a $24 mistake but I'm not making that mistake with the desert. I get the volcano. Brownie, whipped cream, vanilla ice cream, and fudge/caramel sauce. No, just no. The signature dish that's freaking everywhere is just bad. I can honestly say, it would have been better if the bought box mix and made it up. 

So all of this doesn't really warrant the one star but this is one of those meals that keeps on giving, if you catch my drift. The hour spent in the bathroom was the final straw. 

My suggestion, go when it's not busy if the kids just have to go. Order the cheapest thing on the menu and split it. Then go to the food court and get something else. You'll be safer that way."}
{"text":"DO NOT COME HERE!!!! Unless you wish to wait over an hour for your meal. The service was horrible from the hostess notifying my party that our wait was for about 15 minutes but in total we ended up waiting for about 40 minutes! Next once we were finally sat down, we ordered it took over 35 minutes, just to get an appetizer. THE WAITRESS at the most only went to our table like 3 TIMES!! Then came after the 35 minutes only to claim that our appetizer had been sitting at another table!! Never made a sincere apology just came and dropped off the appetizer then their manager came and have a wanna be apology, just gave us more chips. Then our food was brought and it wasn't even hot it was at most warm! Overall it was a horrible experience, then when the bill came they still charged us half of the appetizer! After we waited over half an hour to get it ! DO NOT COME HERE"}
{"text":"The food was good the waiter was nice. But when you have the same item with different price on the menu you should clarify the items . An when you have different people bringing your food then you don't know if it correct or not. Might as well eat only at happy hour because everything is half price according to to waiter. So save your money An don't waste time asking for the manager because she only going to side with the waiter. But honestly If your going to eat there reread your order back or a $6 dollar might just turn into a $20 item"}
{"text":"It takes a lot for us as locals to drag our kids to the Strip for dinner but our experience made it well worth it. We decided to have our birthday dinner celebration for my four year old at Rainforest Cafe. It's a great place for families and young kids. The food was your all American style variety which was good, and came out fairly quickly from appetizer to entree to cake time. Our waiter Jimmy was very welcoming and anticipatory. We brought a cake that we ordered from a bakery and he was so nice about putting it in the kitchen, then preparing it for the surprise and song. All the staff we encountered were friendly and we never felt like a bother."}
{"text":"Birthday dinner time for my kids, and an almost two year old with dairy allergies. Rainforest Cafe! The reviews and website say they are great with allergies.
 I called for reservations, the hostess was sweet and helpful, she told me a chef would come to the table to get our input. Wow!
 The day of our reservations we pulled into the parking garage to learn its $15 to valet park! Yow! We did anyway, and they were great!
 We get to the Rainforest, after a wait at the
Host stand for a MIA hostess we get checked in. Up four flights of stairs and waited some more, then sat.
 Our server was right there to get drink orders, but shaky on which kids drinks were dairy free. I told him I wanted the kids collectible glass, the elephant, and would pay for the smoothie but just wanted apple juice. He said a clean one would be downstairs waiting.
 We ordered, a chef did come out but only after we requested it, and went over the options. Kayden ordered the hot dog and fruit. What was brought out was chicken strips which DO have milk, but when pointed out it was traded quickly, accidents happen.
 The food was ok. I got the Shrimp Platter, two of the three styles of Shrimp were just meh.
They sang to the birthday peeps and gave them cupcakes, no dairy free option for dessert at all.  :(
Then we went down to pay. The glass they offered me wasn't the kids glass it was a glass for adults. I explained to the cashier who called a manager. No biggie. Then the manager swooped out. She was abrasive from the get go, and cranky that I made a mistake. I kept telling her it was ok, I just wanted the glass for Kayden. She informed me I DIDNT PAY FOR IT! I finally told her to refund the money for the wrong glass, I'd buy the right one! She snapped that the glass is ONLY $1.50 and stared at me. I told her I'd ale the $1.50, and where would I buy the elephant glass with a straw for the child who is now crying because he was told he got to take a cup home.
Another half hour and finally she walks me to a bar and tells the bartender I need to order a
Kids smoothie. She leaves to get the cup. Still being a grouchy Cword.
 I told my grandson we would find a cup somewhere where the people didn't yell at little boys and we walked, no cup.
 Seriously this ruined the night. All the fun we had been having was hard to remember as we walked back down.
If corporate reads this please contact me. She should NOT be a customer service contact in your restaurant."}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: Fun, if you have kids or if you happen to like a fake Disneyland environment like a modern day Tiki Room.

FOOD:  Really bad and WAY overpriced!!!!

SERVICE: Very poor...I think they hire Food Servers with no common sense or any people skills.

OVERALL: Save your dime...mosey on over to the Food Court after you stand there ogling over the animatronic alligator and fake fog. Paying for overpriced, crappy food with bad service is NOT worth it."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in years. And today I remembered why... The food is garbage! I only ate it cause I was super hungry. But I must say. Their staff is very courteous and friendly!"}
{"text":"Meh...that's pretty much what I have for this place. It's expensive, the food is kind of ehhh. Point is that it's never going to be my first choice for a place to eat. But, if I am on the strip with kids and I don't mind paying exorbitant amounts of money for mediocre food so they can have the cool animatronic animal experience. Honestly you could probably do better though by going to a restaurant at the mirage and going to the secret garden there. That way your kids will see real animals for probably the same cost."}
{"text":"Ok, I'll save you time and money and just let you know that this place is a bust. Yeah, the atmosphere is kinda cool but that's all that it's got going for it! Food was horrible. Service, meh and we waited forever for our food that I was sorely disappointed in. Our appetizer and meal came out at the same time and the kids meals came last. Completely in the opposite order that our server told us he'd bring it out to us. My kids didn't even like their food and they ordered pizza and the macncheese. What kid doesn't like any kind of pizza that set in front of them?! It's because it was THAT gross. If you find that you really still want to go there, just take a walk through the place and then Go eat at Chilis just down the way. (Because let's be honest, I wish I would have just done that!) You WILL thank me for it! I really only want to give it a 1/2 a star and that's just for the atmosphere, everything else was barf. Yep, I said it. Barf."}
{"text":"Our waitress of the day was sienna. She asked what we wanted to drink and one of us ordered a specialty drink. When she brought it I said isn't in supposed to be in a special cup. Her reply \" I would've had to charge you more and I know you did want that... Know what I'm saying\". NO, I'm sorry I don't know what your saying. Then I asked for plastic cutlery ( as I always do). Our food arrived after 30 min. However we had nothing to eat our food with. I had to ask another waiter. When we finally saw sienna again I asked for ranch and Tabasco. 10 more min pass, she asked if I needed anything and I said yes the ranch and Tabasco I asked for and more water. Someone else brought the ranch and she brought Tabasco with three drops in it and said let her know if I need more......smh. The manager walked passed too many times to count and said nothing. When the waitress came by again, I asked for more Tabasco she laughed and said ok. She came back with another bottle within two or three min. And this bottle had no top and dried up all around the opening( in the picture I posted) I asked another waiter for more and he brought it right away, I was already so annoyed I didn't get his name. Anyhow I do love this place because as a parent of a 19 month old, I want her to see the cool atmosphere. This was our second time here and both times we had bad waitresses and I feel like it the management that's not on top of things so the staff does whatever they want"}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE I HAVE EVER HAD. EVER. My reservation at 7 that turned into a 3 hour dinner.... are you kidding me?

The place is cool and all, I used to go to the one at MGM when I was in grade school but this was disgustingly terrible. It took us literally 30 minutes to order because the server kept leaving the table after we ordered..... It took 45 minutes for ONE appetizer between 12 people to show up and our cocktails weren't even out yet! Are you kidding me???? Then after a hour and a half after me complaining twice wondering where the hell our food was another 20 minutes rolls around and they start giving out the food SLOWLY, like not even in one sitting!? In the first wave of food they literally gave my friend her dinner salad and our food didn't come out until an hour after her salad. They gave out food to 12 people like in  10 minute increments. Are you freaking kidding me? The food was okay, and seriously so overpriced. but WTF seriously guys? Get it together... worst service I've ever encountered in my 22 years of life. I SERIOUSLY SAT THROUGH 8 \"RAINFOREST\" SHOWS MY WHOLE TIME THERE. F this place. Stay away at all costs.

Probably the worst birthday dinner I've ever had."}
{"text":"OK, my daughter has been asking to go here forever, so for her 11th birthday we took her. I have not been since 2006 at the Mall of America in MN, and previously in Florida. I knew it would be overpriced, but it was so much worse than that. First of all, there was not enough barrier between the seating and the mall, and as I watched the dusty animatronics I could see the shoppers strolling by. The vines were so dusty, and have off the animation was not working right. The rain used to seem so much more intense. 

Next the food. First - bring your own water - every drink tasted like sanitizer!!!! We had the waitress rinse the glasses and bring more and it was better, but than the refills tasted like a band aid again. Next, some of the portions were decent - my father in law got the fish and chips - it looked good, had cole slaw and fried. I got the coconut shrimp - about $4 more - had mini scoop of cold icky mashed potatoes and 8 small shrimp stretched on a skewer. Literally, my daughter's kid's plate had more food on it and that was other people's comments not mine. The shrimp did not taste bad, it was just a sorry excuse for almost $20! It should have had a veggie and maybe a salad or bread to boot!  BTW, my wife who is 1/3rd my size had the same meal and also walked away hungry.

So, ambiance was lacking -- it looked like a tired old carnival ride. Food was way overpriced, food portions inconsistent.

Than, I said something to the manager. I waited until it was over because my wife hates it if  I complain, and it was my daughter's birthday. All she said was sorry. I could tell she has heard it before. There was certainly no customer service going on here.

For the next birthday I am going to blow the money on a birthday party instead of a nice meal, or else, go somewhere good for food and find entertainment elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place would be cool if I was really into mechanical animals. Or five years old.

The Rainforest Cafe is just a little overpriced in my opinion and it's a themed restaurant filled with little animals that move every few minutes while you eat.  I think you hear thunder and rain and mist falls on diners every now and then.

For kids, this place would be great.  Especially for birthday parties- I'd definitely plan a bash here if I had kids.  But I don't, so I won't be going back to the Rainforest cafe with their animated gorillas and mysterious smog anytime soon."}
{"text":"Today, my family and I attempted to eat at the restaurant. We had a party of 9 and there were many available seating areas but because we made no reservation (according to a very young hostess) we could not be seated. There was no line. We were waiting approximately 10-15 minutes before we even knew what was going on. Such a bad experience, especially when the young lady told my wife that if we did not like that we needed to make a reservation, we could go eat somewhere else. Really? We immediately got the General Manager involved and he had the exact same attitude. I will be in contact with the corporate office very soon to discuss the treatment we experienced. We are from Texas and wanted our kids to experience the Rainforest Cafe in Phoenix, AZ. Not a good showing for Landry's."}
{"text":"I want to love this place. The service was fantastic, which is always a plus.  The atmosphere is awesome, and they seated us right next to the gorillas, which my kids of course just loved. 

You are paying for the experience, so you really can't complain about the price of the meals.  But... if you are paying for the experience... they could try to keep some actual fish in the fish tanks. All of the fish tanks were empty, which was really weird.  They had water in them, but we looked, and there were no actual fish. (Unless they were ALL hiding, but that seems unlikely). 

A few other things:  The kids menu has \"fruit\" as an option, but in Arizona in the summer, that's just orange slices. I kind of feel like they could do better or list orange slices as a specific option. I ordered the nachos, and I asked them to do real shredded cheese instead of cheese sauce. This doesn't seem like an odd request to me, but the person who made them must have never actually eaten nachos before, because they were SO covered in cheese, and the cheese was so overcooked, it was like eating rubber cheese with chips stuck in it. Really weird. Hard to pull the chips out of the cheese layer and kind of hard to eat. And strangely greasy, especially since I ordered them without meat.  Should be served with a side of salsa, but they aren't -- just the pico de gallo that is on them, which is chunky, not saucy. 

I will come back, but only because my kids don't really care about the mediocre food. They think it's a fun place to be."}
{"text":"My wife and I had not been to rainforest in many years, and always loved it when we came before.  We were seated quickly, had very friendly service. 

We ordered off of their 'special menu'. The food was very so so. The coconut shrimp was great, however the steak and veggies looked like they were from dennys.  And had I paid $9.99 I would have been happy, however it was closer to $27. 

I guess we'll wait another 10 years and give it another shot."}
{"text":"Dino nuggets tasted like bad dog food.  Check your kids meal before letting them eat.  Ick

My burger was ok.  BBQ sauce kept it from being too dry, otherwise it would have been blah.

Still nice decorations really for the kids.

They have birthday cupcakes if it is your kid's birthday, they charge 99cents for them."}
{"text":"Terrible! My fish taco was light on the fish and had a chewy tough tortilla. My wife had a piece of chicken that was chewy like rubber. You can't convince me that this place has repeat customers. This restaurants model is to put up tacky decorations and over charge for TV dinners."}
{"text":"This is a fun place for kids and that's the only positive thing I can say. Service was slow. Food is without flavor and $17.49 for a Cobb salad?? No thank you. I will never go back."}
{"text":"By far the most miserable experience ever. Aside from our waiter who was very nice, my entire family was up till the following day shitting and vomiting our brains out. Its quite bad when every dish ordered (a total of 4) all came out essentially with food poisoning. Whoever the cooks are need to be better aware of proper health standards. I will be making a call to the department of health this Monday!"}
{"text":"Omg great food!  Great service.  Make a reservation or walk by and get on the list while you shop.  They texted us when we should start walking back to make the list.  

Do not get the cheap steak.  The primal is where it is at.  You can upgrade any combo or what we did was get the primal and add on the shrimp for 6.99. The coconut shrimp was great and the grilled shrimp was awesome too.  
Gosh the mashed potatoes were amazing!  Especially with the steak medium rare.

I wish we didn't clean the plate so fast or I would have posted a photo!

Anther trick is to get the souvenir drink and SHARE it.  Haha then get the $6 refills.  You can even change drinks.  

Best service with Hugo!"}
{"text":"The waiter was really nice and my kids love the atmosphere.    I was disappointed they changed the menu some of the items we liked are no longer there.     I don't recommend the red skinned mashed potatoes they had a overwhelming sour flavor.     I got the breaded shrimp it was really good.  My mother in law got the fish and chips she liked it but they do give you a lot.  My son loved the Dino nuggets.   My kids also got cherry icee but they didn't like them they said they were sour."}
{"text":"We ate here right after they relocated. Not bad, and it's sort of a tradition to eat on my birthday there, so we went tonight. 

We weren't disappointed for a Rainforest. While the menu has been paired back over the years and some favorites are gone, we like the atmosphere. The MGM location was second only to Chicago for me, this new location is sparse and almost desolate and too small. On with the food. 

I had the Pastalaya with Caribbean Rice and my wife had a BBQ chicken breast with mushrooms and melted cheese. 

The Pastalaya was very good even though the spicy Creole sauce was a little too thick. The andouille sausage was spicy, the chicken and shrimp were tender. 

My wife's chicken was tender. The topping was a good with the melted slice of cheese. 

All in all, it was what we expected. Too bad that the restaurants at many of the Landry spots have become predictable, less interesting and more formulaic....chicken, ribs, burgers, shrimp, steaks, etc. Change the name and the menus are 90% overlap. Good, basic fare but being back the inspiration which gave us the Rasta Pasta and other signature dishes at the other Landry's places before Landry's bought them."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed going here with the kids! I have not been here since I was a kid and it was great! My 8 year old and 5 year old loved the whole meal. Just like many other reviews I will say the service was slow but we were busy socializing which made time go by fast. They also had great prices for kids meals and even kids cups. I do think the adult prices are a bit much but you do get lots of food. Not a bad place for lunch."}
{"text":"I'm kicking myself for not checking the reviews before going to the Rainforest Cafe. I thought it'd be a fun place to eat before I took my friend back to the airport to catch her flight. We were seated quickly, which was nice. But one look at the menu and I was already seeing a red flag. $13 for a chicken sandwich! A chicken sandwich! Clearly I was playing for the atmosphere. I finally decided on a pasta dish that the waitress recommended. The place was pretty loud... and pretty dirty. Trash was all over the floor. Who knows? Maybe they had just had a lunch rush before we got there? Either way I was not impressed. My food came out in reasonable time, and it did look good. I wish I could remember what it was called, because I was not impressed by the flavor. At all. The only edible part was the sausage that came with it. I finally got the nerve to tell the manager that it was terrible and sent the dish back to the kitchen. He offered to make me something else, but by that time my friend needed to go back to the airport. The only good thing is they didn't make me pay for it. My friend says the chicken sandwich was okay, but I will never take a friend back there again. Or myself. If you're looking for a rainforest like place that uses mechanical animals to entertain/scare the children, go ahead and try it out, but If you're looking for a good meal I suggest finding some place else."}
{"text":"Where do I begin? 15 min and no one even acknowledged us. I can understand if the place was packed, but there was like 20 empty tables! And that was just in my vision area. Four waiters passed us by never asked if we've been helped or anything, and this is that we were even looking around trying to find someone. We finally got up and left and told the hostess, I asked for the manager and all he said was sorry and offered a free appetizer if we stayed. Uh, ya ok, let me wait an hour for that. No."}
{"text":"I would say the service is absolutely amazing! Best service I've ever had! But the food is mediocre but the soup I got was great (corn chowder) and the Canal something drink, highly recommend . I would still recommend it due to the service and experience but the food isn't amazing just a warning."}
{"text":"Love Rainforet Cafe and even though this isn't the most exciting location, it's still a great rainforest!!  The staff is really nice and the food is great. I wish they were a little more organized on the hostess situation. Instead of using the elephant booth at the front, you just kind of wait around the fish tanks not knowing what's going on. Other than that, you can't complain about this place."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and the people there! I went and the hickory chicken with mashed potatoes and green beans and it was delish."}
{"text":"My daughter loves this place obviously because of the rain storm sound effects and animated animals.

We were seated promptly there was hardly anyone there on a Thursday at 11:45 AM.

Our servers name was Scott.

My daughter ordered a kids plate. I ordered potstickers I asked how many are in the order Scott answered \"six cut in half \" I thought his response was a little odd. But was intrigued to see what potstickers were like when cut in half.

When the server brought our food I was intrigued to see what look like six eggrolls. I thought perhaps since I've never ordered rain forest café potstickers that maybe they fry them? I gave them a try they were pretty good. My daughter loved her macaroni and cheese orange slices and watermelon.

When our server came by to check on us he said \"how's the eggrolls?\" I responded oh they are egg rolls because i ordered potstickers. He then said he would put an order in for potstickers right away. 
I watched him walk into the restroom area.
My water glass had a crack. At first I thought it was condensation as to why my table was so wet but after five napkins and wiping it was obvious the cup was broken."}
{"text":"It is overpriced? Yes. Does the service lack? Yes, well a little, but the food here is pretty good and is a great place for kids.  Think of this place like a zoo experience for children.  While I know most adults do not care, kids do and that's why I liked this place.  The burger I got was pretty good and even came with some pretty tasty fries.  Overall, it's a great place to take the kids, just be prepared to spend."}
{"text":"We recently took our 2 year old there for her birthday thinking it was an amazing idea. Unfortunately she was terrified because of all the animals and the little rainforest re-enactment that they do.... almost immediately our server moved us to a closed off area so our little girl was more comfortable... soon after the manager came to check on us to make sure everything was okay. Their customer service was amazing and the food was amazing as well.. we will definitely be back once our little girl is a bit older"}
{"text":"Horrible service and way too long for food of that quality. Ambiance wore off as we waited forever for our food."}
{"text":"Been to a few Rainforest Cafes, Downtown Disney Anaheim and DisneyWorld. Was looking foward to celebrating my sister's birthday here, should've looked elsewhere! The place is tiny! 1/10th the size of other locations with only rundown 5 animatronics at most. 
There was maybe 7 other guests in the entire place with 3 servers, 1 hostess and 2 table boys. You would think service would be on top right? Wrong! Slowest service I've ever had! Had to practically beg for refills. Never got extra napkins and to top it all off you think they would've for the 4 of us to be present when they brought out the cake, nope! Two were in the bathroom.
Not to mention it took 30 minutes to get the dry cold food and another 20 for dessert.
Don't waste your time or money here! Very disappointed, looked forward to it the entire trip."}
{"text":"I took my 3 yr old son here on Monday since we were in the area and wanted to take him some place fun. I've been to the rain forest cafe in the past so I knew what to expect. First its Monday afternoon at 1 pm. Not busy but for some reason I had to stand and wait 10 minutes for the hostess to seat my son and I next to the rest rooms, best table in the house. My son is a picky eater he chooses the mini cheese burgers and I'm not feeling that hungry so I chose the hot wings appetizer. When ordering the wings I ask the waitress if the wings are they a mild flavor or hot. She didn't know hmmm ok. I like spicy food so won't bother me. Food arrived rather quickly, the wings over battered and soggy. Seriously after biting into the 3rd Wing I almost sent it back, but didn't want to cause a fuss in front of my son. My son's mini cheeseburgers were actually full size cheese burgers, way too big for a 3 yr old. So I guess the portion size for the kids menu is good. I tried my sons min cheese burger, I can honestly say I know good cheeseburgers and I know when restaurants use frozen patties and this was a frozen patty, no flavor. I didn't come to Rain Forest Café expecting good food and I didn't receive any. I do like the atmosphere and my son really enjoyed it. My suggestion to Rain Forest Café improve food quality and pricing. Food way over priced for the quality."}
{"text":"Entertaining if you have little ones - but slightly overpriced because of that.  

Service was attentive but but a bit slow.  They appeared a little short staffed (they close at 6pm on Sundays and had a decent crowd in there right up to close).

I had the ribs - not bad.  Beer was cold; decent options for kids."}
{"text":"If you don't mind waiting over a hour for your food then your good, food is meh. I wouldn't come here again. Such a waste of a Vegas lunch, I could of went some where way better in the same place but whatever."}
{"text":"Rainforest has terrible food and the atmosphere smells of plastic like going through a fake plant section at Michaels. Kids didn't even eat because of their food was so greasy. I hated the place because it was so dark, you couldn't tell what was clean, if your food looked good, or they are hiding how nasty they are. On top of that, it was way too expensive for their poorly cooked food. It's not rain forest food, it's comfort food. Sandwiches, salads, burgers and deep fried stuff. Nothing on the menu says rainforest. If you have kids, looking for a deal or some place nice ... look some where else because this place is crap!"}
{"text":"I had a bad experience previously but I wanted to go back  to let me grandson see the animals and have the complete experience. It took 35 minutes to get the drinks we ordered. We had to order the kids meals separated to make sure he got his food. Then 1 hour 15 after that we got our food. (I used the timer on my phone). The waitress was horrible and occasionally stopped by rushing of without really listening. This is the second time this occurred so it wasn't just a one off thing, it seem to be status quo. She asked me about a Landry card and then took 25 minutes to check to see if I was registered. When she could not find the info under my name I said I would sign up because of the other restaurant like Claim Jumper, she forgot to let me know it was $25 to join and said \"I just figured you knew since you thought you had a card before\".  The food was horrible, the tomato soup had seeds in it, the Alfredo sauce was brown and the seafood was over cooked. The drinks were too sweet and we were charged a different amount than was listed on the menu. 1st time could have been a fluke, 2nd time proved this is how they operate and evidently it is acceptable since no manager attempted to check on us but to add the $25 for the Landry card. NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time a few weeks ago and it was really good. The appetizers were good, the food was good, and the service was good. Kids loved the decorations and all the theatrics. We had a great time."}
{"text":"Well, if you want to see convicts serve and cook food. this is the right place!  Between the gang tattooed waiters to chefs that don't wash hands after a big dump, the only safe food are overpriced nachos.  I really though I was on a set of the MSNBC prison break.  The only thing that was missing was a good food fight.  The base was so loud that I thought the low rider civic was parked in the kitchen.  I guess it became better when the magician came to the kids.  Overall, it's a good experience, I gave it 1 star."}
{"text":"It's been a long time sense I've been to this restaurant. My kids wanted to go again they had been there when they were very young. This one is different then the normal ones because you get to experience it along with the amazing view of the strip! Our waiter Roberto was very busy and still kept up with us when we needed something. The only thing I have for the 3 stars is that the food wasn't all that good for 80$ I spent on the 3 of us, I'm a big tipper so that ended up being over 100$ so not worth it."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place out for the first time. I went with my friend and her daughter. After being seated we looked around and were enjoying the scenery. The rain forest vibe was awesome. The fake storms and animal noises were unique for a dining experience. The scenery is the only reason I gave this review a star.

We looked at the menu and it seemed a little pricey but I did not care because I was hungry and figured I was paying for the environment. We waited....waited.....and waited. No one came by to take our order or offer us drinks. After 30 minutes of sitting there without any service, we left and went to another place in the mall to eat. 

Sadly, after reading the other reviews I see that there are many problems other than what we encountered. I don't think I will return until whoever runs this establishment learns how to manage and run a restaurant effectively."}
{"text":"I don't go to the Rainforest Cafe for me, I do it for the kids. They love it there. We went there for a little trip to get out of the house for the day ( and If we are out of the house it also means I can't start the painting project I am supposed to do and it will have to wait until next weekend). 
Anyway, We get there and the hostess tried to put us right next to the door so we asked for another table. They put us next to an aquarium which was good for me because the kids left me alone, but bad for the fish because the didn't leave them alone. 
I got a hamburger with guacamole. the wife had an appetizer. the boy had two mini hot dogs and the girl had a pizza. the kids meals were the right size for them and my hamburger was pretty good."}
{"text":"Took my son here for his 5th birthday yesterday along with 7 other family members....they refused to sing Happy Birthday to my son (it was an arranged birthday party); 2 of the people that had the fajitas are now extremely ill...this place is awful and should be shut down. Our waiter was always missing and every meal we had was cold."}
{"text":"Enough of this place! It's great to look at, my sons love the fake thunderstorms. I hate paying 30 dollars for a beer and an appetizer that's compatible to \"Chili's triple dipper.\" The service usually is bottom of the barrel, and the prices are outrageous for the quality food you get. Save your time and money, I insist."}
{"text":"I think they are lacking staff and probably are trying to hire people as I write this.  I felt really bad for my server, she was slammed with tables and stressed. It did not make for a pleasant dining experience.   She never had time to come check on us one time after our food was served.  We were all out of drinks and went the rest of our meal with nothing to drink.  I thought about getting up and refilling my drink myself.  The food was decent.  I visit Vegas several times a year, and I am not sure I will be giving this place another go.  Hopefully with a full staff they can improve the dining experience.  Price was not worth the experience."}
{"text":"This franchise is very gimmicky, but it works.  I've here twice, and the best part about it is the decor.  Its decorated as if you're eating in the middle of the rainforest.  They even have moving displays, and sometimes (at least in Florida) the lights turn off and your hear the sound of rain and thunder.  Its really cool, quite an experience.  The prices are high, but you have to pay for the atmosphere.  I really recommend this place for anyone who can afford it.  Its really cool.

Derek"}
{"text":"Average. This experience was not better or worse than my last Rainforest Cafe moment. The aquarium was nice; but the speakers for the thunder effects were way too loud and often interrupted, not complimented the experience. Our server made four visits including to collect the check. They were clearly understaffed on this Saturday night. The food quality was again, average. Overall the atmosphere was alive & well, but not as epic as a RF experience should be. Love the other review that equated the thunderstorm experience to a Safeway produce section. So true!"}
{"text":"After having a wonderful weekend at edc, I thought it would be great going to my favorite restaurant. We wanted to get seated outside so CHARLIE the waitress took us there, and then another worker comes back and approaches us VERY RUDELY telling us where we are sitting is a fire hazard and lying saying that the other worker tried explaining to us that we cant sit there, and that we didn't listen. This was the MOST WORST experience at a restaurant i've had. You don't assume your loyal customers are lying to you nor do you lie about what actually happened to your coworker. In a restaurant Environment you have to make your costumers feel welcome, NOT HERE this place is Unbelievable!!"}
{"text":"Server seemingly forget about us. Wife's food was cold when arrived, and i had to wait 15 minutes for my burger cause it was originally \"undercooked\". Sorry but your cooks didnt undercook anything lady, you forgot to put in our ticket. Pro tip: this place doesn't care about your service or experience, just want to overcharge you to the maximum, don't ever come here looking for a decent meal, not even with kids.

Rainforest Cafe used to be among my favorite restaurants, this experience just got it booted from the list, and i will never come back. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere.  That's really what you pay for.  The thunderstorms and rain and fog... The food is OK.  Nothing to rave over and nothing to bellyache over.  Prices are a bit steep for what you get.  Service is average."}
{"text":"For kids, this place is great!  I took my daughter for her 10th birthday dinner and they gave her special attention start to finish!  They gave her a Queen of the Jungle hat to wear, they sat us with a good view of the frequent animatronix simulated rainforest effects.   We asked for kids menus and the waiter let both my almost 10 and 12 year olds order from it no problem.  The kids ate everything... it tasted good and there were many kid friendly food options.  My son loved his $2.99 mud worm dessert wbich is a great price IMO.  For my girl, they came out and sang to her and gave her a cupcake with a candle to blow out.  She had a huge smile on her face which is what you want for a birthday girl!  Service was friendly, fast, attentive and they checked on us often.  The waiting list process is easy and convenient... they text you when it is your turn and also show you where you are in the wait via Yelp.  For a kid friendly meal, this is a great choice!!  I ate their chicken quesadilla appetizer for 10.99 as my entree and I enjoyed it also!"}
{"text":"I would rather be a freegan and dumpster dive then ever swing into the Rainforest Cafe again. I would rather eat.....
....at the worst Applebee's in America
....vending machine food
....my own flesh

Now, Rainforest could be fun if you were 12 and drunk. Then the overly fried foods and canned sauces could cure your munchies. I would have rather had Totino's pizza rolls than the nasty appetizer combo we shared. The plant and animal filled space could really use the services of Merry Maids. Really. How do you clean all that crap? 

The rainforest \"thunderstorm\" is as exciting as the one in the produce section at Safeway. So if you have kids who like to drink, you might have a good time here. Otherwise I say stay home and check your trash like a good freegan."}
{"text":"Great burgers! I did not like my order, so they fixed it at no charge! The storms are great!"}
{"text":"The only reason I gave this place two stars is the decor! Stay away - it's such a waste of time and money. Took a half an hour to get our food and when I asked the waiter about our food, because it had been 30 minutes, he had the nerve to correct me and said \" it's been 25 minutes\". I guess that is acceptable?!?! The food was bland and way overpriced. I always knew it was a tourist trap and have stayed away for years, but my son wanted to go. NEVER EVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"The first 20 minutes when you are in the Rainforest Cafe, it is cool..

After that all the animation became old and stale, even can drive you crazy!!

The food here are expensive and does not worth the price they are charging. 

And of course this is a family restaurant, there will be tons and tons of kids... if you do desire a more adult dinning experience, please stay away!"}
{"text":"Went here for my first time in a very long time. Was seated right away. Ordered 2 fish and chips and 2 chowders a Bloody Mary and 3 draft beers. On one fish I asked for the veggies instead of slaw. Only one chowder was brought waiter thought we were going to share, other soup was brought out about 10 mins later after food was brought out. Neither entrees came with the veggies I asked for. The rest of dinner went fine. Bill came out and we were charged full price for soups instead of the add on with dinner price. the waiter tried to say it was because of tax but eventually checked menu and fixed it. We were charged $9.25 per draft beer and no one told us it was because we get to keep the cups it comes in that we never wanted. Had to look over a menu on the way out to double check draft beer prices to find out we get glass cups. Bartender was mad we didn't keep our dirty ones and was ignoring the waiter trying to get us our cups.. Ridiculous. Staff seemed so overwhelmed and it wasn't even that busy. $100 for 2 people for horrible service and average food."}
{"text":"Came for the experience of a Rainforest Cafe, and I will not be returning. The service was awful. We waited an hour for our food to arrive and even considered leaving as we were so hungry. Despite the horrendous service, the food was actually quite good. I ordered the coastal redfish without sauce and with extra veggies instead of rice, and everything was delicious, especially the shrimp and pineapples that topped the fish, hence the second star."}
{"text":"My 8 year would like to share her review:
Me and my mom go to this place alot and it is always packed. This place has awesome food. I love the fake thunder,animal noises, and of course the fake animals. I don't care how long I have to wait for the food because if you are hungry you shouldn't care either. If you are hungry and want a good fill I think you should go here.     :)(:"}
{"text":"This place is nice and the food is good. When the rainforest animals go off, that's awesome. I think they should add some misters so people will get \"rained on\" lol"}
{"text":"The noise,lights and animals are merely a cover-up for the slow service, lackluster food and expensive dishes. Don't expect to add a house salad to your $12.48 turkey wrap ladies and gents here they want 4.49 to add it as a side. $37+ later we won't come again."}
{"text":"This is a special place for the kids, if you want them to be entertained and not worry if they get a little loud and excited about something this is a great place to take them. The food is nothing special (think theme park quality and prices), but it really is a one of a kind place. The pressed penny machines are always a cool and cheap, $.51, souvenir, that should help you getting around spending money in the attached gift shop. They have a full bar, and the kids can get a kid friendly frozen drink in a special cup. Kids meals are about $6-$7, adults range from $15, for soup and salad combo, to $22-$30 for fish or seafood. I wouldn't go here for the food, but go for that look on yours kid's faces and the cool parent/grandparent title for taking them there!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is amazing I can say the burgers are great the pastalaya is to DIE FOR SUPER YUMMY"}
{"text":"My family and I loved this place. Everyone is nice and the fact that everyone works in a team is amazing. I dont live here in Las Vegas but when i do come back and visit Im definetly coming back here. Never had I been to a place where i feel 100% Satisfied with food and service. Thanks for a pleasant time"}
{"text":"Forest of Disappointment

I went here with friends because one of them has a nine year old boy.  Big woo! This place was boring, overpriced, and past its prime.  After a 25 minute wait (for eight people) the service was good and the food was average.  You are better off giving your kid a coloring book and taking them to the zoo."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Rainforest Cafe since I was a kid... I guess there was a reason for that. I went here with work since the students were studying the rainforest and how to behave in a restaurant. The service was sloooow, we were there for about 2 hours. The food came out far apart...making some of the kids upset. The food itself was nothing special. I had some mashed potatoes and clam chowder. Chowder was like the stuff you get out of the can... the mashed potatoes were ok, but gluey. The main issue with this place are their prices. They are insanely overpriced. You can't get an adult meal for less than 12$ and those meals are basic sandwiches... the entrees were about 20$... even for pasta.... craziness. Even their entree salads were 15$. I would not come back here."}
{"text":"Rain Forest! Rain! 

So my lovely gf brought me here for my first time ever and I really enjoyed the experience. This is the type of place you come to for the novelty aspect. The whole restaurant is decorated to make it look like you are inside a rainforest, and they did a really good job. I wish I had come here as a kid because it looks like so much fun. Heck, I was even having tons of fun looking at everything as an \"adult\".  Every once in a while it \"thunder storms\" inside the place which is pretty cool. 

The food itself was decent. . .  I wouldn't go to say that it was amazing but it was good. I had the \"Mojo Bones\" which are actually ribs lol, they were pretty tasty. I can't complain. The prices are a little high but that's understandable. They probably have really high maintenance costs for that place. Our server (aka Tour Guide) was nice even though it was super busy in there.

So overall this is a great place if you want cool scenery to eat in. I would come here again but maybe not during dinner because there are way too many screaming kids in there lol. If I had kids, I would definitely take them here for a special occasion because you have to admit, this place is cool. 

TL DR: come here not for the food but for the experience! 

3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Guacamole Burger is good, as well as Tomato Basil soup. The kids ordered off of kid's menu. The food they receive is just ok. I am not impressed with the quality they serve to the kids. Having said that, they enjoyed themselves.

Beware of the lightning storm that occurs every so often. My 2.5 year old was afraid.

My bill came to 47.00 total (with tip), for 1 adult and 3 children."}
{"text":"Service was good, the arrival of the food was a bit slow. The food was not that good. Got a BBQ chicken wrap which was ok not worth $15. Also the shrimp,meat, and rib trio. The meat and rib tasted fake and not that big a portion for $33. The inside is cool for kids though."}
{"text":"Came here last a few weeks ago. We were surprised they moved locations from MGM to PH. The food was consistent with other RFC. Probably will try out something else next time. Very fun for the kids though."}
{"text":"Chef is very helpful and knowledgeable about food allergies. My wife had celiac and was nervous about dinner. The chef personally came out and went through the menu for her. He was very nice, and knowledgeable. They definitely go above and beyond here! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Had my Grand daughters bday dinner there recently, while the food was marginal at best the service was terrible. They have a lot of work to do to turn it around."}
{"text":"We almost didn't come here because of all the negative reviews. I like taking my family of son and spouse and daughter and spouse and their almost 2 year old daughter and 6 month old son.  Made reservations for a highchair, possible 2nd highchair, stroller parking and seats for 5 adults.  No problem and we were seated pretty quickly even with a change of 4 more adults.  (We called ahead of time)  Party of 11.  We all were very comfortable and not crowded.

Lets be clear.  If you want gourmet food, this isn't the place.  I do have to admit, that we all really enjoyed our meals very much.  The food came out pretty much in a timely fashion with appetizers first, followed by entrees.  I was prepared to get a bite when I got home, but I was pleasantly surprised.  Coconut shrimp . .yum.  Haven't been to a Rainforest in years, and was most pleased with this visit.

A lot of the success of our visit was our server, Andre.  Very efficient and wasn't rattled by seprate checks and out inability to get it together in the beginning to even get a drink order together, much less the rest.  He also was very personable, professional and helped with our positive experience.  His \"helpers\"  were also spot on.

The best part?  Granddaughter, Saturn, loved the animals and atmosphere and especially going crazy at our table every time there was a lightning storm.  She would scream and squeal and flail her arms around amidst huge grins.  Thanks to the storm, no one was bothered by her and my exuberance.  So much fun.  We will be back and will not fear the food and service as other yelpers have warned.  All 11 of us had a great experience."}
{"text":"Messy set up- thought I was in line to be seated... no I was in line for the baby stroller drop off.  After getting out of that clearly unmarked line I stepped into the actual wait to be seated line.  The waiters and waitresses were dressed in safari gear which fit with the rain forest theme.  The restaurant is dimmed  so you can see the small star display on the ceiling and the trees are lit up with fish tanks randomly placed around the interior.  Personally I thought the menu was very over priced for the generic food that was served. I tried to play it safe with a cheese burger and chips and that ended up to be $15.00.  Burger was dry and the bun was greasy.  The chips were tasty though kettle cooked.  

I had my hopes on going to this establishment but I just wasn't pleased. I think more exotic food items and semi lower prices or even a happy hour sort or menu would be a great idea."}
{"text":"Took my family here to celebrate my son's birthday. We have been to the Rainforest Café at Downtown Disney and in Tempe, Arizona and always enjoyed it. I read the reviews and ALMOST did not come here thinking it would be horrible and a waste of money but we are super glad we came. We were sat right away, service was excellent and the food was good. Hubby had the Luau platter, it didn't quite look like the photo on the menu but was very tasty. The kids all had a great time and my son loved his lava cake, our server Bill was great.  We went on a Sunday approx. 4pm. Would definitely go back."}

{"text":"Waited 30 minutes in line to be seated. Not a big deal right? It is when they seat you and there a many empty tables. Menu....pricey. must be really good right?  Mediocre at absolute best. Steak was stiff. Shrimp was rubbery. Ribs were way overcooked. Truly a disappointment. Server was nice. Atmosphere is nice. Will not be back."}
{"text":"I always arrive in town ruing morning hours and my first stop is Rainforest Cafe for a Bloody Mary and their colossal nachos.... I mean come on Nachos for breakfast it's SO Vegas Baby!! They can get busy at core dining times with a wait and my understanding is they offer a nice breakfast but I'm a LSC so I get immediate seating and my LSC points so this makes visiting here even better. The food here is top notch for a schtick kind of restaurant that is a chain but it's a Landry Property so I wouldn't expect anything less as their properties are always top notch or better. 
This place is fun for visitors of all ages but certainly a must for those traveling with kids."}
{"text":"I came by a few days ago with my granddaughter.  She is 7 years old and the animal fun excited her.  I am plant based and avoiding most meats, especially red meat.  I figured a place named Rainforest Café would have items on the menu that would encourage SAVING the Rainforest.  Many of the trees are cut to make way for BEEF CATTLE.  I ordered the NATURE BURGER.  Here is the menu description: NATURAL BURGER A meatless patty of garbanzo beans, vegetables, sesame seeds, spices, guacamole, lettuce, tomato ...I have no idea what the heck this is made of...really. I have tried veggie burgers at many places around town (best so far-VEGEWAY on West side... 7790 S Jones Blvd).   What a shock this yucky pattie was!  It is by far the worst burger EVER.  This is a huge chain restaurant ...they could really make a difference with just a couple of tasty meat free items tied into a small donation to save the Rainforest..with each sale...even one penny per... FOR GOSH SAKES!! ."}
{"text":"The tropical ambiance at Rainforest Cafe always creates favorable impressions for my husband and I. Last time we brought our little one and he loved the surroundings. This time we went without the kiddos to use my Landry's Select and birthday rewards. I loved the savory shrimp trio and my hubby had a bbq wrap. We also enjoyed the strawberry mojito and an refreshing frozen beverage. We sat on the patio and had amazing views of the Strip. While it was a bit cool, the heaters outdoors created a comfortable atmosphere. Additionally, Marcus our server was so attentive and welcoming. It was nice that the manager came by to see how everything was too. Only reason for taking off a star was because the entrees were significantly smaller. Thank you Rainforest Cafe for a delightful dining experience and my souvenir birthday mug! Happy to be a Landry's Select member :)"}
{"text":"Take your money elsewhere, unless you've got kids.  I really try to like this place.  A family member signed me up for the discount card, so I've been going more often, but I just don't love it.  It's simply ok, but the prices are outrageous.  And the sounds and animatronics are a huge distraction from the so-so food.  The cocktails are alright, but, again, the price is not right.  The ony thing fun about the place for an adult is the gift shop and the light-up cocktail glasses (which cost extra.)  I've seen a lot of happy families in here though, so I bet it's better if you have little ones to bring along."}
{"text":"This was the best service ever at this Rainforest. We told them food that we couldn't eat the person making our food came out and talked to us makings sure it was made right. Manager was great and our server"}
{"text":"Kid-friendly?  And how.  So there I am, sitting in this restaurant, engulfed in the middle of what's been re-created as a jungle setting.  I hear animal cries in the distant, I'm seeing rainbows out of the corner of one of my eyes, the waiters/waitresses seem all fit to lead excursions in this Rainforest...  Sorry, why was I there again?  Was it to be distracted by the gorillas in the mist?  (where there were, a few of).
~~

Hubby, baby and I came here for lunch today.  Busy, but not impossible to get in.  We were seated in 15 min. or less.  The menu arrived, and my inner jaw dropped to see the upped prices for simple salads as an add-on: nearly $5 or 6 dollars, if one opts for a side salad?  The average price of meals was between $9-$15.   

Not many options for vegetarians, let alone vegans.

They don't combine food items, unless you're willing to pay a premium.  Be it for french fries, a salad, mashed potatoes, a soup.  I still can't get over how much they charge for a side salad!

Why so much?  They need to feed electricity bills, all those jungle leader-waiter/tress hybrids, all those gorillas, and exotic fish that they keep on display so that families have ample visual stimuli to distract their wee ones with.

Restaurant meets Disneyland, meets a mild Jumanji.  

It seemed unreal to be there, and I was completely confused as to why any group of adults-only would choose to eat here (instead of, say, the Moxie's directly in front of Rainforest Cafe).  In a long and large blink, this place kept little ones entertained.  In another blink, it felt like mad hysteria come alive.  I didn't know, other than at my own family members, which direction to rest my eyes in.  

A definite experience.  To be enjoyed at least once, hopefully in the company of kids.

Expect food to taste o.k. (blah if you're a foodie), and to pay cha-cha-CHING for your meal...  Still, you get the extra entertainment, which in the end... makes this place ok if you've got a baby/child in tote.

Call ahead, to see if they have any specials going on.  I remember seeing something about Wednesdays, and kids eating for $3.99 with any purchase of an adult entree.
~~
They have regular \"Canadian\" options -- appetizers; soups/salads; burgers/sandwiches; pizza/pasta; desserts..."}
{"text":"Super cool and fun for kids! Sit inside and you can watch the thunderstorms and see the monkeys and elephants move and make sounds. The stars twinkle as the sky slowly changes colors. There's even a glowing rainbow and moving butterflies! 

Other bullet points include: 
Standard kids meal options available 
Overpriced cute souvenir cups
Large selection of frilly adult beverages
Outdoor balcony seating with a strip view

If you're a local, there's really no convenient place to park. If you're a tourist with at least one kid, you should add this to your list of restaurants to go to. If you're a group of adults looking for a place to eat, you should definitely skip this one."}
{"text":"The food was just ok. It has a good atmosphere for the kids. A little loud but that's to be expected. Prices are high and servers are slow."}
{"text":"This place could use a good dusting.  When it first opened everyone was amazed at how \"real\" the plants and animals look.  Now - they look dusty.  Very, very dusty.  Now I'm guessing it would take even more that a massive dusting to bring back the days of 2 hour long waits and lines to get in the doors (Yes, it was like that for a LONG time) but it sure would help.  

I have a friend who loves the food, so I've only been there with a child once (sad I know).  Every other time it's been with all adults.  Yea, it's Disneyland cheesy, but it's also kinda Disneyland cool.  You have to appreciate the work behind some of this stuff.  And remember - it's a theme restaurant. It's supposed to keep it's theme front and center.  And yea, it can get a little loud.  Especially if the gorilla starts going off on one of his long rants as you're trying to order.  But I've never really had a problem with it in hearing the group or giving our order.  

My favorite part honestly is the archway between the restaurant and the gift shop.  It is a giant fish tank.  No animatronic fish here.   Real fish.  And it's pretty freaking cool.  But the star it might gain from that it immediately loses for the prices.  Just like many theme restaurants, they are overcharging you for the food.  Of course they have to cover the costs of maintaining that fish tank and all those animatronic animals.  So while I kinda get it, it's still too much for a regular dinner.  

Their gift store is almost another review in itself.  Again, a bit overpriced, but they honestly do have some really cute stuff.  I've gotten a few small things here as gifts over the years for kids who are in that \"I love animals\" phase of life.  Always a hit.  

When your aunt and uncle with kids come into town and want to go somewhere different that the kids will like - You'll get big bonus points for bringing them here.  Other than that, it has a fairly limited audience.  And dear heavens, don't bring anyone who is an OCD cleaner.  They may never leave."}
{"text":"Honestly, I just came here because I saw the outdoor seating. You get an amazing view here, I have no idea why you'd want to sit inside. 

Anyway, I've only seen a Rainforest Cafe once before and it was in a mall so I figured it was kind of crappy. The food was actually pretty good with a lot of seafood options. They also let me walk in with a drink without making me discard it.

I would definitely recommend this place for the view and the food!"}
{"text":"Randy is incredible! If you ever get so lucky to get him as a server, tip him well! He deserves all the accolades!"}
{"text":"Las Vegas NV, the city that I visit at least once a year and take my kids to all kind of restaurant and resorts that I know they will have fun. After all the places that I've visited on my vacations and actually dined to have a nice family meal, Rainforest Cafe was the worst. Anything about that restaurant was unpleasant. It took them forever to find us a table even though you could see they have empty tables available. My son was very hungry so we decided to sit outside on the patio in that hot weather thinking it will be faster to order food. After 15 minutes siting with hungry kids and a baby, a waiter passed by without even paying attention to us or just take our drinks order. I had to get his attention and ask for someone to come and service our table. After waiting for another 10 minuets a guy came all sweaty and very unpleasant, introducing himself as the manager and wanted to take our order. I immediately order a pizza from the kids menu and I mentioned that again that my son is very hungry and get that food to him fast. My husband took care of the rest of the order and I got busy with entertaining the kids while we are waiting. It passed another half on hour and no pizza or any of the appetizers or lunch. The waitress came who seems to be nice but embarrass about the whole situation, and explained that the manager forgot to put the order through, and the food should get to the table shorty. I was very frustrated and I couldn't understand why they can not be more professional and caring when they see kids on the table. After 45 minuets the appetizer got to the table, cold and soggy, 10 minutes later the manager came with my sons pizza with a very bad attitude and his explanation was that my husband asked him to bring the appetizer first before anything else. I looked at him sarcastically and mentioned to him that I personally asked you to bring the kids meal first, so stop lying. The quality of the food was zero and everything wad either uncooked or cold and tasteless. My kids couldn't eat the food which they wait for it more than one hour. We all got up and ready to leave that nightmare restaurant while almost all plates where untouched. The manager was so so rude and a big time layer. They only thing that I was happy about was that my husband didn't leave any tips for them, just paid the bill and got out. Will never ever go back there anymore, and do not recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great and our grandson loved the animatronics.  The food was horrible though.  $18 for nachos that were very skimpy portions, tasted like they were heated in a microwave with stale chips, and our daughter had to ask for salsa to go with them.  My husband has an avocado burger that wasn't very good either.  My grandson and I split the Hawaiian Kahula pork and ribs.  The ribs were very fatty, but the kahlua pork was the best I have ever had, but there was only a small scoop of it.  They served macaroni salad and rice with it so we paid $26 for a very expensive macaroni and rice dish.  The host was friendly, but we were trying to surprise our grandson with the animals and when he seated us he said have you been here before?  When we said yes he said okay so you know about the thunder and lightening and animals moving!  Spoiled the surprise for our grandson!"}
{"text":"We had a huge party, about 40 people and the manager was outstanding! The servers were amazing! The food was great, the service was fantastic!!!"}
{"text":"Warning!- the restaurant is no longer in the MGM- it moved down the strip to 3717 Las Vegas Boulevard South.
This review covers their 2016/2017 New Years Eve party ONLY.  The location was perfect for watching the fireworks. The restaurant was not over sold so there were no lines at the buffet  or bar.  The entertainment was a hoot (shout out to Dustin Balloon guy & Michael the Magician). Also their female manager spent the night hustling and making sure the party ran smoothly. This was one of the few rocking parties on the strip that would could bring your children to.  We will definitely go back next year!"}
{"text":"We just ate here tonight and they have stepped up their game well at least our waitress did she had a great attitude and was always there when we needed something. It's a fun place for kids. 

I was really surprised by their French onion soup it was delicious and we all shared the dessert that has dry ice in it super yummy."}
{"text":"This place is an amazing place to build memories. You definitely go there to the experience, you rather than the food. I got the chicken tenders and they honestly weren't bad - $16.99 for chicken tenders at a restaurant like this is pretty steep, though."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly. Food was so so.. like bar food.. I think it would be entertaining for little ones but not a place for quality. .. NO FISH IN GIANT FISH TANKS.... Bubbling water and some \"coral\"..."}
{"text":"Our family of four went out to eat here and everything was well done and very tasty. We had honey barbecue chicken and it was really good I also had a hamburger that was very good and the service was good also we will go here again"}
{"text":"First time at this particular rainforest cafe. Been to others in California and the one that used to be at MGM. If the weather is right, the outdoor patio is the way to go. I came here for my daughters graduation. Nice clear warm day and the view from outside was great. Most come for the animatronics inside with the thunder and lightning. Your coming for the atmosphere not for 5 star food. Obviously food is themed to the restaurant. Your not going to get a Zagat rated steak or seafood. I got the bacon burger and it was made to my specifications. It was good. Service was ok. All in all, food is overpriced but your on the strip so it makes sense. Won't be back anytime soon but not because of a poor experience, but because I live here and you play here."}
{"text":"I had never heard of a Rainforest Cafe. I really had no concept of what it was*, until one glorious day last weekend Matt M and I ventured into the suburbs to pick up some needed nail salon supplies and check out the Yorkdale Mall. 

I'm glad I waited to write this review, because Matt M and I can make anything fun if we're both in the right mood, but the truth is the Rainforest Cafe is for children and the food is sub-par, even for a chain. 

We had their big app platter, it came with calamari (rubber rings), Asiago dip (not enough chips) some sort of quesedilla/samosa like things (weird) and mozza sticks. The mozza stickers were actually fine, so they don't get any shame brackets. 

On the side of this most awful flavorless carb fest, I had the clam chowder. This was really salty, and actually totally yummy. Like, not great, but I like salty chowders and this hit the spot. When I ordered the chowder to go with the app platter, Matt M told me that was a weird side dish to get. Then he ordered. Wait for it. A side of mashed potatoes. Now THAT is weird. Ammiright?! \"For me? Oh just a side of mashed potatoes.\" Not a normal sentence. Ever. 

In case you were also a Rainforest Cafe virgin, here's it's deal: this place is like eating in a rainforest, with stars above you, fake animals that move every fifteen minutes and a thunder and lightening storm every thirty minutes. If you have kids, I can see how it would be really fun for them. 

PEPPER POINTS: For their bottomless fountain soda pop. Slurp. 

*I feel a bit like a deprived child. My family traveled a lot, but like, to Istanbul, not Disney World. #bragbrag** 

**I hate myself for putting a hash-tag in my Yelp review. I'll do better."}
{"text":"I went here for a fun lunch with a friend and her new baby, but instead... no one greeted us, there were hardly any customers there to begin with. Once I asked to be seated, no one took our order. I went to the cashier's area to inquire. When our order was finally taken it was delivered wrong. My friend, being polite, started to eat her shrimp on her salad, when she had ordered chicken. The server offered to \"pull\" the shrimp and bring chicken. How do you pull shrimp off of someone's plate? He saw my look of horror so he said his manager was being very nice and sending chicken. I had several strands of short black hair on my plate, as did my friend. It was so awkward, we hoped they were strands of hair from the monkey swinging above us, but I think we both knew better. I couldn't wait to get out of there. Oh yeah, my mule drink in the brass cup was good. All in all, overpriced, thus empty...lackadaisical servers."}
{"text":"(Mental note - its a hard line to post poor reviews, hence the pending draft for 4 months)

There were literally 10 reviews I could have copied and pasted about the poor food, over priced food and slow service. The only thing I can add is INFLEXIBLE. 

I ordered the fish tacos and not only were they $17.99 (which is a far cry for fairly prices). Literally not customizable what so ever. As most Arizona's would appreciate asked for a salad in lieu of rice and beans which came to shock would cost me an additional fee if $4. No im not kidding. So now my super average meal transformed into unreasonable not to mention disgusting. My now weak tacos accompanied by gallons of mayo in tasteless ranch on my $4 salad just tipped the tables


We don't be back, pathetic and poorly managed. There's no experience or atsmophere other than the zoo that would i frequent and pay money for with such underwhelming result. Buh bye Rainforest."}
{"text":"I insisted on bringing the family here for dinner while on vacation in Las Vegas. Last time we ate here several years ago, the rain forest cafe was located in MGM. We stayed at MGM and walked down to the Rain Forest Cafe at Planet Hollywood. We were promptly greeted and taken to our seats. We requested a booth and that request was met. I was surprised that the restaurant was so empty. When it was at MGM, it was packed. Anyway, our server was totally on point and everything was perfect. All of the food was brought out cooked to perfection. The ambiance was a little off, though. I guess I just expected a crowd.  This restaurant is a lot smaller than the previous location at MGM and way smaller than the Anaheim location."}
{"text":"I took the kids here expecting to suffer through it all. But it was really enjoyable. The kids love it and the food has improved a ton since the last time I came here."}
{"text":"Your basically paying for the atmosphere. Food is just ok, small portions and very pricey. But the kids love going. They offer a military discount. The service is always excellent! Parking is free. It's a pain to get to the restaurant. Like a 20 min walk from when you park."}
{"text":"Went to this outdated, poor quality food, crappy dump of an eating place. VERY loud with the stupid monkeys screaming, thunder, over and over, scared my 10 year old grand kids. After waiting an hour for food I stopped another waitress and told her if we didn't have our food in 2 minutes we were walking out and they could take the food and cram it. She went to kitch and 3 people brought out this horrible sub standard food. Over an hour to get the worst food I've had in a very long time. Burger tasted like it was beef mixed with possibly ground turkey and freezer burned flavor. Bun was hard as a rock, chopped lettuce on burger was turning brown, grand son ordered mashed potatoes loaded with garlic (not edible) sent back for corn (ice cold and floating in water-frozen corn)microwaved.I will never go back to this place and will definitely tell everyone I know to stay away from this ripoff of a place, they should shut it down and go out of business."}
{"text":"Just wow. I just moved to AZ from NC and went to the Mills to get some new work clothes. I had about an hour until I could get into my condo so I decided to have a cocktail. I walked up to the hostess, let her know I was going to sit at the bar, and took a stool about 3 seats down from one of the beer tap stations. I was the only person sitting at the bar. After about 5 minutes, the bartender appeared and started making drinks for customers in the dining area. He turned around and looked right at me no less than 3 times, but never came over. I eventually got up and left and let the hostess know that no one ever acknowledged me so I was leaving. She didn't seem to care very much."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place now the scenery is amazing it's so realistic the sound the lights the graphic they have this beautiful view showing Vegas the food is delicious top quality I would recommend it to anybody who loves Seafood I give this place five stars"}
{"text":"Long wait on a non busy Monday. About 45 mins to get seated. About 45 mins to get the food after that. Food was expensive but low quality. I would equate it to about dive bar standards."}
{"text":"This is a cheap trip to Disneyland . And like Disneyland, this is one of those places that everyone should see at least once as entertainment. But certainly not for the food. 

It's entertainment disguised as a restaurant. Nifty fish and fish tanks,  mechanical animals that are better the Chuck-E-Cheese, cool rain and thunderstorms (way better than the produce section at my Safeway),  and booze to calm the soul as you know that you and your wallet are being shaken down. The kids smile; you smile. 

 Mediocre to bad food that is WAY too expensive, but the kids love it. Fortunately the kids outgrow this and quit asking to go so we all get to move on to better eats at a better price."}
