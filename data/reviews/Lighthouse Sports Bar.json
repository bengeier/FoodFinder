{"text":"I went to this place cus we where new to the west side and liked to do karaoke and this bar was close by. 1.) The bartender was sick with the flu and still working?? 2.) this combo bar thing is weird and attracts different style crowds that don't necessarily mix 3.) the way you request a song was different and confusing and the host didn't follow the list anyway. In my book that's 3 strikes your out!! and the search goes on for a good karaoke bar.:("}
{"text":"Lighthouse is the greatest club on the westside of the valley!! Drinks are cheap especially the big pitcher of dos Equis!! Got karaoke on one side and hip hop on the other! Music is Kracken like feet without lotion!!! Lol but for real hit the light heezy on a Saturday you won't be disappointed! You have lames, ratchet, nerds, weirdos all walks of life which make this place a great clubbing experience!! Definitely going back this Saturday to see hoes take off their bras for 100 bills!!"}
{"text":"Great place to try out your new bullet proof vest and a warm glass of beer. Shady place beware"}
{"text":"The place is clean and a large pitcher of beer is only $6.75 until 9pm.  It then goes up to over 10 bucks!  Anyhow, nice pool tables and the bartender was friendly enough.  Karaoke on Saturday nights and T.V.'s on every wall.  Not too bad of a place, but a few more visits will tell it's true \"character\"."}
{"text":"I went to the lighthouse last night and had a blast. But when i was closing my tab there was an extra 100 dollars on there that I did not ring up. I talked to the manager about it and I was told that they were not going to do anything about it because it was already ordered. They were asking how I was keeping count. I had 10 beers, 10 because I was ordering for me and my girl. They put an additional 19 beers on my tab. Then when I was disputing it the old lady bartender kept screaming at me saying that she gave me at least 20 beers herself. On top of everything, they charged my card twice.   I will not be returning and if anybody does go don't open a tab because if someone walks out they will put it on some other tab so they don't have to lose money."}
{"text":"Met my now fianc√©e here 7 years ago, it used to have an amazing crowd and casual attitude. One side was a DJ, bar and dance floor, the other half was a mellow karaoke bar with with pool tables. Now it's just another trashy DTF bar for people with no standards."}
{"text":"Four years ago this used to be my go to bar on Friday nights. Bunch of good looking military boys and cheap drinks kept me coming back.   Came here Saturday night with my sister's and niece and I left within an hour.   Talk about nasty! Girls there were half dressed. Ass's hanging out of the skirts and they weren't even cute enough to pull it off. Talk about a fat girl bar! I am a bigger girl myself but holy hell made me feel like a super model in this place.   It's sad because I used to have so much fun at this bar and the fact that I live so close to it would have made me happier to be a regular again. But sadly the people who attend this bar now are not my crowd and I will not be returning unless they really revamped the whole place."}
{"text":"It is a townie bar.  However, they have photo hunt machines and they are loaded with Erotic Photo Hunt!  Nuff said- at least for me!"}
{"text":"The absolute worst excuse for a bar I have ever experienced in my life. Went for Karaoke was early.... Asked server for a menu she said they only had like chips And snack.... Told me I'd have to go next door to the Mexican restaurant if I wanted any food.  OK... Getting better... Karaoke was 45 min late some little old man, maybe an owner, does it and is not in any way shape or form any sort of a DJ.  The server heavy side woman kind of blondish brown hair was not terribly pleasant.... Looked at us as if we had 8 heads when asked about food...  A rather terse attitude. First time to try Karaoke. It's small non descript space that has a few tables and pool table squeezed in.... Not my mind of place not sure why or how they are in business.... Neighborhood McDonalds would of had more character."}
{"text":"Just not for me  Tonight, I decided I would stop by Lighthouse Sports Bar.  I have passed by the Lighthouse countless times but have never stopped by to see what it's all about.  The atmosphere was okay, you could tell some of the patrons were regulars and knew the the staff. On this visit a few friends and I ordered a few drinks and decided to take advantage of the pool tables.  I have to admit the service at the Lighthouse was a tad slow and the bar isn't as clean as it could or should be. There were a few people that had to much to drink and after a argument with other patrons were asked to leave.  The Lighthouse isn't the worst place I have been to and you could do worse in a pinch. However, the lighthouse just isn't for me."}
{"text":"Saturday night provided good dancing and awesomely organized karaoke!"}
{"text":"The lighthouse sport bar is quite something else.  If you are looking for eye candy then don't go there. The crowd was pretty ghetto and not too much to add more there. However the music was pretty good with a mix of old school, new, and classics. The drinks were ok with mixed drinks & shots at $5. For a review I would give it no more than 2 stars based on the drinks and music but none more than that"}
{"text":"So what do you even say... Approached by the bar tender. Got a beer. She left instantly to go outside... Comes back fifteen minutes later and asks if we are okay and proceeds to go back outside for the duration. Yes I got my beer. And yes we had service. But for about 2% of the time we were there. That aside, you walk in and the first thing you see are the bathrooms, with about four or five dudes seemingly fighting over a pretzel... Looking for a TRUE HOLE IN THE WALL with mediocre service? Yeah... You found it. Pretty much just good for someone that'll give you a beer when asked!"}
{"text":"This is one place to stay away from, the drunk bartender Oscar hit on my girlfriend right in front of me, and it made for a very uncomfortable night. I was also wondering when the gang fight was going to break out.   its no wonder way drink are cheap here.   All though the their car so few dive bars on the west side I would say STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE"}
{"text":"Ghetto dive bar. We had fun. It was an odd place. Right side had a dj playing hip hop and all the minority's hung out there. Over on the left side of the building after you pass through the small corridor. You have pool tables, karaoke, and it's white as can be."}
{"text":"This use to be a great bar to go to. Was a fun place to go hang out any day of the week. They have pool tables prices are cheap which is good. Unfortunately over the last couple of years this place has gone downhill. It has the neighborhood dive bar atmosphere which is what I like. But this place has turned from a dive bar to just trash. Fights all the time and place just seems extra dirty. For the most part the bartenders and bouncers always seem pretty cool. Just the overall atmosphere of patrons has took a turn for the worst."}
