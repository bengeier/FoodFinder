{"text":"We had a great dinner experience- food was delicious and the service was fabulous. We tried the Dahl stuffed Puri, Vegetable samosa, chicken korma (bone is in), shrimp entree, Palau rice and the rice pudding for dessert! The food did not take long and was hot & fresh when it arrived. 
The owner explained all the items on the menu and was keen to share lots of background information on Bengali food which is always enjoyable. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious had Chicken Samosa,  Beef Khabab, 
Chicken Korma, Beef Bhuna, Phulkopu Aloo, ...fresh great service"}
{"text":"Some of the best and most authentic Bengali food you can get. Always go for the special as it would have been prepared fresh that day. I ordered the Beef tehari, whole talapia, shrimp curry and roast chicken. If you are really adventurous and love sour yogurt based drinks, try the borhani."}
{"text":"This little Mom & Pop restaurant, which looks like a fast-food burger joint, is truly a mecca of deliciousness. 

I'd never had Bangladeshi food before Sabz organized a UYE here, but from the moment she mentioned it was 'like Indian food' I was sure I'd enjoy myself. 

And oh boy, did I ever. 

Everything was wonderfully prepared - hot,  mildly spicy, and nicely fluffy, crispy or melt-in-your-mouth tender depending on whether or not it should be. 

We tried lentil pastries, chicken korma and what was probably beef bhuna, bhaji (potatoes & cauliflower), Niramish (mixed veg) & Bagun (eggplant), as well two types of pilaf (known as Pulaw). The korma and bhaji were definitely the best dishes to me - they had more complex (and delicious) blends of flavours over the other dishes and were cooked to perfection!  We also had Firni, a rice pudding dessert, which was the first rice pudding I've actually enjoyed in my life - it was sweet, cold, and had a great texture, vs. being the typical grey mush I've been subjected to at other places. 

The place was spartan but very clean, the staff attentive, and the price ridiculously good ($14 each plus tax and tip).

Not quiet sure HOW I'll get back here (International Ave isn't very accessible w/o a car) but I'm DEFINITELY going  back - it was such a great experience!"}
{"text":"Fantastic dinner, wonderful flavours. Delicious fish! We had the Bhat, the delicious Naan, the Tilapia Machh, and on and on. I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"A real, authentic, TRUE Bangladeshi restaurant in Calgary?! This is too good to be true!

Some quick education for non-Bengali folks: Bangladesh is a small country nestled right beside India and Burma. The food is very similar to Indian food, heavily curry-and-rice based, but usually less spicy, and a little less 'rich', if that makes sense. 

I arrived at Nilu's Kitchen this past Sunday for brunch with my non-Bengali brunching partner, super excited. As soon as I walked through the doors, I took note of the interior of the restaurant. Very bare bones, with not much in the way of decoration.. almost had an 'office' type feel to it. But everything was extremely clean, I noted happily. I walked up to their 'reception desk' type counter and was greeted by a young Bengali lady who spoke fluent English to us, which was not necessary for me, but I guess put my brunching partner at ease. The modest brunch menu was up on a chalkboard. As I read the items, a warm feeling of familiarity swept through me. The brunch items were authentic, true Bengali brunch items which are typically eaten in Bangladesh on weekends. Very simple, but so true to the roots. We ordered 3 parathas (pan-fried flatbreads), fried eggs, a beef bhuna (beef curry with a lot less 'sauce' than normal curries) and aloo bhaji (curried potato strips) and two cups of Bengali cha (chai). 

The food came fairly quickly to our table. The parathas were amazing. Flakey, cripsy on the outside, but doughy on the inside. The fried eggs were typical Bengali style.. with pieces of onions in them. The aloo bhaji was awesome, as was the beef bhuna. Me and my non-Bengali brunching partner literally wiped our plates clean, and it all left us salivating for more. Everything we ordered were top notch. Nothing fancy about any of the dishes, just good quality, true home-cooked Bangladeshi food. The kind your aunt would make for you on a Sunday morning in Bangladesh. 

I loved Nilu's kitchen precisely for that. They are not trying to be something they are not. It's a family-run restaurant where they are lovingly preparing classic Bangladeshi dishes and serving it to the public at affordable prices in a modest establishment. As we finished our meals, more patrons came steadily streaming through the doors, and we could tell that this restaurant had already gotten popular among the South Asian community. A fantastic start to the first Bangladeshi restaurant in this city.

At the end, our meal came up to around $22. A steal. A big fat delicious steal.

For all you folks interested in giving Bangladeshi food a try, let me know, I'm looking for any excuse I can get to return to Nilu's Kitchen! But a word of caution: be prepared to eat with your fingers :)"}
{"text":"Oh, my goodness. Why have I not tried Bengali food before? Maybe it's because Nilu's is the only Bengali restaurant in town. But being an adult means taking charge and not making excuses! So with Sabz organizing our feast, I girded myself for an evening of Morsel Kombat.

We started off with an appetizer of Daal Puri, AKA, Deep Fried Pockets of Deliciousness. Handheld savory pastries, filled with lentils and served with a tamarind-y Bengali style ketchup. Hot, crispy and fluffy on the outside, spicy and cozy on the inside. 

I was about to lament only getting one each, but then the owner came out and cheerfully told Sabz in their native tongue that the rest of the food was ready to be served family style: Two different kinds of Pulaw (steamed rice cooked with saffron, cardamom and other spices), Bhaji (potatoes and cauliflower), Niramish (mixed vegetables), Bagun (smashed eggplant), and I think Beef Bhuna and Chicken Korma. All served with sliced cucumbers, tomatoes, and chilis for separating the men from the boys (or getting in to a duel with Chris K.). 

In order to get the full experience of the meal, we ate with our right hands; scooping up the food with a couple of fingers and pushing it in to our mouths with our thumbs. Some of us, were more graceful at this art than others! Of the dishes, my favorite was probably a toss-up between the Bhaji and the Bagun. Sabz told us that the food had similar spices to Indian food, but wouldn't be as hot; but the distinction was clearly made with the Bagun, it was unusually delicious and a flavor I had never experienced before. It also packed quite a bit of heat, and as someone who regularly snacks on habaneros without breaking a sweat, if you plan on ordering this; brace yourself.

Dessert was Firni, a rice pudding made with yogurt. I would've been sad that I couldn't eat it, if I wasn't bordering on uncomfortable fullness already. And after all that food, the bill was under $15 + tax and tip. Madness. Nilu, you are a wonderful chef. Thank you for opening up your kitchen to us!"}
{"text":"Amazing flavor full food, friendly staff and feels like a real authentic place. Had the chicken in milk sauce and balsamic rice, vermicelli for dessert. All was really good."}
{"text":"Located in the same area as my favorite asian supermarket, I've overlooked Nilu's because it's on the other side and I never saw much of a reason to go over there.

Until Sabz' International UYE!

I found Bangladeshi Cuisine a bit tamer from Indian food, but just as rich and tasty. I slathered on the various curries on our all you can eat experience on my rice and my calorie tracker app once again went insane.

I gotta be honest, with the high energy of Yelpers sharing the experience of eating without utensils (and with class I might add), I couldn't quite pin down the names of the dishes we had. I loved the chicken and beef curries and packed in as much protein as I can. But the veggie dishes were just as wonderful. The potato and cauliflower found some room in my stomach and I couldn't get enough of the eggplant, which had a standout heat to it.

For a $15 experience it was amazing. A lot of thanks to Sabz for putting this one together!"}
{"text":"great food.. excellent service.. sunday brunches are awseome lot of varieties"}
{"text":"Took my brother who lives in Ohio for some of their excellent food that he will never have a chance to try there. He was amazed that the owner told him that what we had ordered to much for us to eat. The goat was seasoned just right and fell off the bone. This place is just a plain mom and pop caf√© that offers some great hospitality and food!"}
{"text":"potato pancake app was yummy.

be prepared to eat with your hands cuz they don't give utensils (tho we didn't ask either!). 

fish and chicken are not boneless so be careful.

entrees ordered were a bit on the greasier side with visibly grease, but all was tasty."}
{"text":"Took the bus from downtown to Nilu's with my wife for Sunday lunch. Our first time there and it was fantastic. The food was amazing, with the most tender and flavourful beef bhuna. Topping the list was the adorably friendly owner who was sincere, considerate, and we had a great conversation with before and after lunch (no time for talking during, we were totally entrenched in the deliciousness). Aside from the flavour, the food comes at a very reasonable price. Love this place and my wife and I plan to be regulars."}
