{"text":"Great place to grab a quick lunch. The hummus and falafel was delicious and the service was excellent. The family that runs the place are really friendly. I will be eating here regularly."}
{"text":"Immediately, I was greeted upon entering well-lit and lean Shab's. The counter cases or coolers appeared less than happy, but showed me a pan full of home made baklava among other items. The air-conditioning was delightful on this warm day. 

At first I strained my sight to view and decipher a lunch menu up above the counter person's head, to which she perceptively interjected in a friendly way, \"here, would you like a paper menu?\". Yes, please. Wonderful. 

The babaganoush (I am sorry about the spelling) was good as was the Mediterranean Salad. A bit too heavy on parsley for my taste though. I should have added some salt. Pita bread heavenly."}
{"text":"Decided to visit Pittsburg and wanted to grab something fast...  I grew up eating Mediterranean food.   Ordered the falafel, baba ganush and gyro...   Out of my whole lifetime, I have found the most disgusting Mediterranean food in the world.  The food was  NOT fresh, Baba ganush tasted like a paste taken out of a jar.  Gyro was just pita and some meat...  sauce was some cheap mayo mixed with something else.   
Everything about this place reeks, including the cashier who is also the kitchen guy and the prepare.   We went on a Saturday around lunchtime and this place was totally EMPTY.    That should have been the warning sign.   This place is so run down and just garbage."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot downtown for the ethnic food junkies! Falafel and gyro options are delicious. The strollers are well portioned and good for a lunch on the run. The platters will fill you up. Fast service, friendly staff, and decent location in the business district.  Very fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Shab's is my new favorite lunch spot downtown. While not always home to a perfect meal, they do hit a lot of the items on my personal checklist for fast, reasonable lunch spots. Plus, the wait for food here is about a quarter of the time I've spent at other eateries that specialize in healthier meals - which is pretty big perk, I have to say.

The menu at Shab's isn't the longest, and when you walk in it's clear that this place is meant to be a fast stop; the seats and tables remind me of a cafeteria and there isn't much in the way of welcoming decor. But, it is a bright and clean place. They also routinely hand out brochures and flyers that list their meals and calorie counts in plain sight - which is more convenient than going online and navigating through a website or Googling to find nutrition info on what I want to eat. Fast, healthy food to go? I'll sacrifice cute decor for that.

The food itself is generally tasty too, with options ranging from just salads; to platter plates with meat, rice and vegetables; to gyros and pita wraps. However, I do have one complaint about the food they serve: they microwave some of it. I mean, you can see them do it as you wait for your order. As a result every piece of meat I've eaten here is bone dry - hence my less-than-five-star rating.

Fortunately for Shab's, I like eating here because they aim to serve healthy dishes overall, and they do serve fresh vegetables; even more fortunately, when you slather any meat in the sauces that come with your meals, it helps to mask the dry parts of your meal. If nothing else, I always have the option of bringing some juicer cuts of meat to work myself, and just getting my salad at Shab's. And since it's quicker to grab a fast, healthy meal here than many other places near my office, Shab's for the most part is more than a satisfying lunch option in my book."}
{"text":"Definitely worth a try.

Very clean.

Very friendly staff.

Nice alternative to the fast food your usually stuck eating downtown."}
{"text":"No no no and NO! I walked a few blocks to go to Madonna's and they were out of Chicken Sharwama. Go figure... but it is one of the nicest days of the year and I waited until 145pm to have lunch. I also hadn't eaten breakfast. I headed back towards my office and this led me to Shab's. I should have known better when the only patron sitting inside was sweaty and probably killing time until his bus came. After reviewing the menu, I decided on a gyro combo. Combos come with a side, I chose tabouli, and 12oz can of soda. Insert side eye here... the gyro meat is clearly presliced garbage. Pita was dry and the sauce is not tzatziki. Tabouli was good enough to eat again but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Shab's Grill & Pita Strollers is an amazing restaurant. Specifically, the food is inexpensive, extremely healthy (but good!), and there is a wonderful atmosphere that feels like home when I walk in. It's the perfect place to grab lunch for the professional on the go! Try their falafel strollers, they are awesome, especially with the tabouli salad."}
{"text":"I've eaten my fair share of Lebanese food. Shab's is a great spot in downtown Pittsburgh. I highly recommend their chicken platter. So much great, fresh food - for a reasonable price. If you're looking for a quick, healthier option - Shab's is a great choice. Shab's Rice and Nellie's Rice (lentils) are both delicious. Tabbooli is great, but I like their Mediterranean salad even more.  Pita bread has been less than fresh the last few times I've had it, which was disappointing, but forgivable."}
{"text":"Here's a combo that you'll rarely find:

-Family owned and operated
-Homemade (and delicious) food
-Nutritional Information for the entire menu

There's something special about interacting with the same person who came up with the original recipes. If you happen to order Nellie's rice, you'll have a pretty good chance of Nellie serving it to you (or packing up your order). 

 The prices are on par with just about any quick-service restaurant down-town, but the quality and care are quite a bit more. You can eat out, affordably, enjoy plenty of flavor and an ample amount of food...without smelling like a garlic bomb or like you need to take a nap.

They're a PGH Sustainable Restaurant and there menu has plenty to please any type of dietary requirement. 

This is a routine stop for me when I'm looking to pick up a late lunch, or early dinner especially when I'm down-town."}
{"text":"First off let me start by saying I wish there was a no star option!! This is by far the worst place to eat in the history of places to eat. My friend and I went to Pittsburgh for a day trip and stumbled onto this place. Upon walking in I asked the kid if they slice their own gyro meat or if it's pre-sliced. He told us they slice it themselves. So I ordered the gyro. Which, by the way was pre-sliced garbage that was put in the microwave before being served to us. The baba ganoush which my friend ordered tasted as if it was made a week ago. And the falafel balls which were were hoping to get were heated up in a microwave and tasted like rubber. To be honest I don't know how any body here could give it such high ratings? Unless they either work there or have no standards or lack tastebuds. If you value your health I recommend you stay out."}
{"text":"It's always exciting to see yet another mediterranean takeout place open up downtown. Between Madonna's, Istanbul Grill's two locations, Palmyra, Shab's, Christos, and Alihan's, you could eat tabbouleh for lunch every day of the week without visiting the same place twice.

Shab's is definitely a solid option for a quick bite to eat. They focus on the usual middle-eastern fast food options, including \"pita strollers\" (small pita sandwiches), hummus, tabbouleh, falafel, etc. While they're not the best mediterranean option downtown, the food is always tasty, affordable, and served quickly.

One unique aspect of Shab's I appreciate is that they've organized their menu to accommodate health-conscious customers, with calorie counts listed for all the menu items."}
{"text":"I have to give 4 stars bc of the service. The staff is very welcoming. Otherwise probably a 3 for now. The cucumber sauce is really good. Tom and Jerry special was a great blend of flavors. The feta really made the tabbooli pop with flavor. It comes with a pita. I put pieces of gyro covered in hot sauce along with the tabbooli, Mediterranean, and Tzatziki Sauce on the pita which was dripping from the bottom with juices. The strollers are great. You literally can stroll down the street and eat it by how it's nicely wrapped. The gyro stroller was ok. Just slightly on the dry side. With more sauce it would of been satisfyable. The grape leaves weren't marinated enough and lacked the lemon flavor. The hommous was the same way. They make it fresh everyday, so maybe it was just today. The other things didn't taste as good today. Overall enjoyable.  Will definitely go back. With all of the different combinations, customizable options including the implied openness to customize the wall of fame, I would suggest this place."}
{"text":"I had noticed a new Mediterranean place was opening downtown a few months ago. I had been excited ever since. The shop is located on Forbes (near all of that ungodly construction between wood and smithfield) 

I didn't know what to eat for lunch and checked out shab's. all of the employees were nice. Everyone from the lady who handed me a menu outside, to the cashier and even the person handing me my food. 

They make 'strollers' which is a pita wrap in a sense. They have everything from gyro, chicken, hummus, falafel, all veggies ect, They also have entrees, but majority of the menu is for the pita wraps.

I went with the grilled chicken stroller. You can choose your sauce (tahini, cucumber, bbq, tzatziki. I went the tahini. The cashier also asked if i wanted hot sauce on it and i agreed. 

The wrap was delicious, Shabs seems to pride itself on heatlthy food and fresh ingredients. my wrap was extremely fresh and dellcious. They had other mixes of Mediterranean food.  Im sure ill be back."}
{"text":"I had the chicken gyro value meal. I chose the salad over the soup. I had 1/2 tabbooli and Greek salad.  The gyro wasn't bad but could have had more seasoning. The salads were very good, there were a nice amount of vegetables and seasoning. Overall the food was good for the price, $8.75."}
{"text":"Shab's, a relatively new place that opened up on Forbes, boast a \"Delicious\" \"& Nutritious\" alternative to the downtown lunch scene. It's Mediterranean fare including pitas, gyros, strollers, falafels, lentil soup and salads. They seem to pride themselves on heart healthy, low carb, low fat meals and they even have the calorie count on the menu behind the counter. 

Although they offer catering and delivery, the restaurant itself has a bit of a \"fast food\" feel to it. It's well lit and there's plenty of seating but the plastic utensils that they provide are really pretty chinsey. 

This being my first time here, I choose the classic gyro platter with green beans. I placed my order with the gentleman behind the register and he gave me a number informing me that I could pick up my meal at the end of the counter. It didn't take long for me to hear my number.  I was given a tray with a disposable tin bowl containing a generous portion of rice under thick cuts of gyro meat, a pita and the green beans were swimming in a stewed tomato dressing. It was actually pretty tasty and I left feeling full without bloated. Cost out the door was just a little over $9.00.

Overall, I wouldn't tell you to stay away and I'll most likely be back. But on the other hand, I wouldn't put it on my \"must try\" list either. It is, however, a nice alternative to the \"elephant scab on a bun\" lunch that you'll find in so many fast food joints."}
{"text":"I've been getting back into eating Mediterranean food once again and this place is cozy, affordable and delicious."}
{"text":"Excellent falafel sandwich, made with fresh ingredients and not old-grease.  It might cost a bit more than a street food truck, but this is very healthy and clean.  Definitely a good food source for downtown lunch."}
{"text":"I walked by and decided to give this place a shot. After looking over the menu, I ordered the Grilled Chicken Stroller meal. Immediately after I ordered I saw a flyer on the counter that Gyro, Chicken and Falafel strollers were on sale for $3 though Order Up. I asked the girl who took my order \"what's up with this?\" She said that it didn't start until 1p. And I said \"but it's 12:57!\" And she said \"well you'd have to do that outside at the Order Up tent.\" I thought it was very inconsiderate to not inform me that if I waited 3 minutes I could have saved some money. I should have asked for my money back, but decided to give them a chance still. 
Unfortunately the food didn't stand up either. My GRILLED chicken was cold (was it supposed to be?) and very dry. 
Disappointing all around."}
