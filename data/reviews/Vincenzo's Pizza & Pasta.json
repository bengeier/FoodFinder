{"text":"Only one star bc 0 stars isn't an option. Ordered delivery. Food arrived cold and was missing part of my order. When I called I was told they are \"too busy\" to send the rest. So I paid for items that were not provided!"}
{"text":"Fantastic....quick service, a HUGE hoagie, delicious Pizza, Breadsticks and a  Soda for $20.  No way you are gonna get that kind of deal anywhere else in the city.  We love and we will be coming back for more

Salute!"}
{"text":"Food was delivered earlier than stated and it was HOT!! Delivery driver was polite. Buffalo chicken bites were good. Pizza was decent. Not out of the world. Ordered a side of each and got two. Would order again."}
{"text":"Ordered a few pizzas for delivery thru GrubHub. It was pretty slow, but I don't blame them for that.

We ordered pepperoni pizza. I feel like it's a pretty standard order and a good indicator on how good they are.

The pizza tastes okay. The cheese is decent, the dough is decent. However, we noticed that the sauce is extremely acidic. When I say extremely acidic, I mean it. My stomach was destroyed that night, as well as the other few people I ate this with. They decided not to eat the rest of it and throw it out.

The price is low and it tasted decent when we first got it, but I really don't think I'll ever order from here again. The recipe for the sauce or something is just not good, and I value not puking.

Now we didn't order appetizers or anything so maybe that stuff is good, but as far as the pizza, there's way better places around here. Don't order here."}
{"text":"Vincenzo's is my go-to pizza.  I have a hard time with pizza places in the South Hills as I usually find one that is great and then they get worse pretty quickly.  Vincenzo's - get the special Vincenzo's sauce - is a good standby that hasn't decreased in quality at all.  The sauce is great - not too sweet, the crust has a decent flavor and they put a lot of toppings on - which is key in my book for a good pizza."}
{"text":"Update July 2017 - Cheesesteak strombolli is on point! Living in Philadelphia and growing up in South Jersey outside of Atlantic City I'm no stranger to cheese steaks be it on a roll or stuffed in a strombolli this hit the spot. Buffalo bites were damn good too!"}
{"text":"We ordered hoagies from Vincenzo's. We were pretty amazed at the number of hoagie options! They even had 3 vegetarian hoagies to choose from! We ended up ordering the chicken bbq, steak ranchero, eggplant parm and mediterranean hoagie. The eggplant parm was a clear winner and I'd recommend it over the others. The hoagies were pretty huge for the price! We'd ordered two each because at $5.49 each we didn't think one would be very filling. But I was quite full with half a hoagie.. and saved my second for lunch the next day! Cheap, filling and tasty! Perfect for that movie-night-grubhub-order kinda evening with friends!"}
{"text":"First time ordering from Vincenzos, I ordered a bacon cheeseburger, Ceaser salad, and a drink. It took 90 minutes to deliver to Carrick, needless to say my burger was cold, but that was the least of my issues. There was no cheese on the burger, the bacon was literally raw, the lettuce was brown, and my top bun was broken in half. I should have just went to McDonald's. Never ordering again."}
{"text":"We order delivery from here often. Our food always arrives on time and hot. Our favorites include the garlic Parmesan breaded wings and the cheese pizza. We have always received good food and good service!"}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty good, doughy which isn't for everyone. Delivery arrived much sooner than expected, and came with ranch for dipping which I didn't expect but greatly appreciate. Would definitely order from them again!"}
{"text":"We ordered through Grub Hub. We ordered a small white pizza with tomatoes, a dozen wings and a small salad with honey Simon dressing. The order was 15 minutes late being delivered. They gave us the wrong dressing, the croutons were soggy, the pizza was tasteless and the wings were swimming in butter. Never again."}
{"text":"Ordered pick-up via the yelp Eat24 app; the process was quick and easy! I liked that you could check the order status within the app as well. 

We got a small garden salad w/ ranch dressing, a small Italian calzone, and a large Italian hoagie.

The garden salad/dressing were very good; the veggies were fresh and it was a good size for a small.

The calzone was also very good and pretty big! The outer crust did get a little watery once i cut it open but I think this is standard for most calzones. It was not overly greasy or garlicky, and the outer crust was crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside which I like! I would say the small calzone is the size equivalent of an 8-cut pizza folded in half- there was a good balance of meats, melted cheeses, and ricotta cheese, and a large sauce cup for dipping. I got an extra one because I wasn't sure how big the cup would be, but I would say one cup is enough for the small!

My SO definitely liked his Italian hoagie - it was baked with a thick layer of meats and veggies with a tangy Italian dressing that tasted homemade for sure.

I would definitely order from here again, especially using the yelp Eat24 app. It is a solid option for pizza in Dormont!"}
{"text":"Worst food I've ever had in Pittsburgh. Ordered buffalo chicken rolls and there was no buffalo sauce in the rolls at all and looks like they used chicken scraps (meat was super dark and fatty). Buffalo fries were burnt as can be do not go here.... EVER"}
{"text":"You would think a place that delivers to you once a week sometimes more would know how to get the food to you. Then call.and say someone else Will bring you the food because the driver doesn't know the address. Umm no thanks, keep your cold food, I'll go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is one of our main choices when we order in. The pizza is good. Has a fluffier crust. The sauce is a little sweet, but not as sweet as other pizza places around. My kids really enjoy this place. They especially enjoy their burger and fries combo! I personally enjoy the salads, particularly the buffalo chicken salad and the Mediterranean salad.
The price is very reasonable for what you get. Delivery is fast and the drivers are always very nice. They also actually read the special instructions that are given for a food item when we order which is surprisingly hard to find a place that does for some reason."}
{"text":"We stopped in one evening, knowing nothing about them, and ordered 2 pasta dishes. The eggplant parm was delicious as was the Tuscan chicken. A delightful Italian eatery. No frills inside but the food is fresh, all veggies in both meals were fresh and cooked perfectly. Recommend!!!"}
{"text":"You know, I had written off Vincenzo's when they were in their old location, but with a move to Dormont and perhaps a change at the helm (?), something good, improved has come along with it as demonstrated by a recent delivered meal. 

A fantastic and generous Pennysaver coupon deal got Kay and I two large pizzas and a whole Italian hoagie one lazy, worthless evening, and I couldn't find much to pout over. 

There is a Pittsburgh-style pizza: Thick 'n doughy. However, Vincenzo's apparently has something to say about that, offering a pillowy, light-in-the-loafers crust that nearly floated out of the box. Both the mushroom/pepperoni and the pineapple/bacon pies we ordered were piled with fresh toppings. The fungi was fat. The cured meats were oily, sweet, piquant, and brackish. The fruit was succulent like that which falls off of Paradise's trees. The cheese/sauce tandem was almost akin to dessert. This was a rather successful pizza. 

The hoagie was another winner, its juicy, tangy, crunchy fixings well-stuffed within a dissected and toasted bun, the grinder itself showing the world what subs should be, and they ain't being hawked by celebrities or a guy named Jared. 

Ordering was a cinch, delivery was faster than a thought, and overall, Vincenzo's saved dinner. 

I've even better such meals, but they are few in number. Order from Vincenzo's. 'Cause I said so!"}
{"text":"Ordered a pepperoni pizza.  The crust is thicker and the sauce was a little sweet."}
{"text":"The food is good, not spectacular. Wings are decent. Their pizza is really solid. Delivery is always prompt and even early most of the time. All around, this is a really good place for delivery pizza/wings/hoagies."}
{"text":"I will say this, when you get the right food, it is awesome... over the past 2 months I've ordered from them 6 times for delivery. Out of those 6 orders, which are always the same. Pepperoni pizza (large) and order of buffalo wings. Five of those orders were wrong. If you call and tell them that you got the wrong order the owner yells at you and tells you it isn't his fault. They always made it right, although last time the dough wasn't cooked all the way on the correction order. It's a shame because the food is good they just can't figure out the logistics."}
{"text":"I ordered from this pizza place last night. I enjoyed how convenient it was to receive quick delivery and a perfectly executed order. However, the pizza was very hard to eat because all of the toppings kept falling right off of it. I felt that the buffalo chicken rolls had no buffalo sauce in them and that my Caesar salad was just a house salad with a packet of caesar thrown in. Regardless, the pizza tasted good and the Oreo cheesecake cake was a treat."}
