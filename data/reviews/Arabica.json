{"text":"Woo hoo!! Arabica is back with a whole new look! So happy to see all the baristas again! Great cafe mocha, cheesecake, and the baristas who provide the best service. Can't ask for more than that!!!"}
{"text":"The place is homey. The coffee is good. The service isn't pretentious. I don't know what else one could want from a coffee shop."}
{"text":"Just finished my second sugar cookie. They were great.  Best breakfast I have had in weeks.    Service was quick and done with a smile on her face.  Place was clean and active with customers. This is great to see with the \"big chain\" coffee shop just down the street."}
{"text":"Worst coffee around.  Great location, that's the only reason people put up with it; its conveniently located. But nasty unbearable bland coffee."}
{"text":"Microwaved egg and cheese bagel sandwich.  Supper dry and difficult to eat.  Not recommended for a visit."}
{"text":"It is a fantastic place to lounge around, or work on your laptop. Yet, service is slow; there is usually only one worker who is cashing you out and preparing your food and coffee drinks. Coffee is okay. Pastries have run out by lunch time. And although they have great baked potatoes, the odds of them having potatoes on stock are slim."}
{"text":"We deicded to try Arabica In Amherst after seeing it featured on New Day Cleveland.  We were disappointed.  When we walked in there were a few other customers seated at tables (total of under ten people).  We placed our order and sat down.  After 15 minutes our drinks (iced tea and lemonade) we brought to the table.   After 30 minutes the appetizer we ordered arrived (a 6 piece deli spiral order).  To put it nicely--they were overly toasted to the point of one side being burnt.  2 minutes later our meal was brought out.  While the food was good (burgers and fries) was it worth waiting over 30 minutes for?  NO.   I don't think we'll be returning. There are too many other good places to eat in the area:  Ziggy's, Brew Kettle, D'Tutanellis.    I would hate to see it if this place was actually busy."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick cookie and some coffee. Barista was very nice. The sugar cookie was amazing. I had both coffee and ice cream tea. Like them both very much. Great seating indoors and out. If you're in the area stop by."}
{"text":"I remember coming here as a disallusioned teenager back in the day when grunge was popular, I had dyed black hair, and wore combat boots.  The place would be FULL of cigarette smoke, and occasionally, you would smell a clove cigarette burning somewhere.   This is where all the \"cool\" kids hung out.  I, alas, was not one of them.  My friends and I would sit here for hours and people watch.  My favorite memory of THINKERS was seeing my favorite teacher crush, Mr. DiFranco, on a date!  Ooooh!    Lots of memories were made there, that's for sure.  It's much more sanitzed now, hipsters and yuppies galore.  I miss the days of the skater boi's hanging out outside skating in the library parking lot."}
{"text":"Arabica is in a great location and overall very nice on the inside.  The reason I gave it three stars is because the WiFi has been unreliable.   Plus when I ask for help from the staff they didn't seem too excited to help out."}
{"text":"I love spending time here.  The coffee is good.  Pastry is usually good.  The ambiance is exactly what I want in a coffee house.    Sadly they are being forced to move, although it will only be a few doors away from the current location.  I'm going to miss the old decor....brick walls, old elevator, stairway, etc.  I hope they can somehow recapture the charm of the current location."}
{"text":"My new favorite place to hangout and get some work done while sipping coffee!  The atmosphere, food selection and prices are all better than my previous hangout (Starbucks).  They offered free coffee refills while I was there and all four varieties I tried we're well brewed and tasty (I like my coffee strong).  I ordered breakfast and lunch and both were delivered to my table within 10 minutes and were enjoyable.  A great local cafe!"}
{"text":"Have been here for lunch twice in the last two weeks and cannot say enough about this place.  They have a great breakfast and lunch menu.  The lunch includes several sandwiches and salads and both have been excellent.  You can have the sandwich sided with sweet potato fries which are delicious.  I haven't yet had the coffee but the list of different drinks looks amazing.   Both times I have been in, the people working have been so friendly and helpful.  We did take-out once and they had everything ready to go and the order completely correct.  The second time we ate inside and it was a nice, quite atmosphere where we could have a conversation.  I highly recommend Arabica."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere but food was not very good. Fries tasted freezer burnt and the tuna melt did not taste fresh."}
{"text":"Typical coffeehouse atmosphere, good decaf coffee, decent brownie (way to hard/cold, way to big - was like fudge) - but nothing that would draw in back over another coffee place - if I am in the area and need a beverage I would go in again though.   Tons of options for people on flavored drinks, they had a salad board and stuffed baked potatoes / so if you need food and not coffee this may be your place!"}
{"text":"Posting this as I'm still waiting for the sandwich and salad I ordered 30 minutes ago. Not lunch break friendly."}
{"text":"Me and my wife saw that it was under new ownership and had a breakfast, lunch and dinner menu on a friends Facebook post so we gave it a try. We got the French toast with home-fries and bacon. It was compatible to any other place for breakfast, but the home-fries were excellent (chunks of real potatoes, seasoned to perfection). My wife got coffee and loved it. No soda fountain but they have plastic bottles of Coke-Cola (I got water but really wanted a soda fountain pop). They have Kierdrowski's pastries (got to love a snuggle with breakfast). It's a great environment to sit and have a conversation or watch the city go by. Also a quick in and out if it's to go your looking for."}
{"text":"What a nice little early morning spot for some coffee. They have the regular coffee urn offerings: light, dark, flavoured and decaf. It's alright, coffee-wise."}
{"text":"I am updating this review I have no clue what went on since you  moved locations now this place is full of snobby people that thinks it's beneath them to make you a cup of coffee. Place was dirty un organized and the staff had a sense of entitlement to them. WTF the coffee has also dipped in quality. I don't know what happened but you guys need to fix this if you read these reviews or not. I pass up another coffee shop on the corner to walk down to yours but I think I'll Change that and give the other place a try.five years of coming to the same place and I slowly saw at the Decline again what happened"}
{"text":"Great coffee, big tables, plus during the week it's nice and quiet, so it's a good place to study or get work done...the only thing that is annoying sometimes is that they fill their cups to the absolute top so if you get a cup to go you sometimes have to sit there and drink a little bit before you put a top on or risk spilling!"}
{"text":"I really love DTW and this place is enjoyable.  I like the atmosphere and the small town feel.  I typically order Italian Soda as well as get a lemon bar,  which are fantastic.  Service is nice as well.  Came here not too long ago and sat and played some board games they had laying around."}
{"text":"Super cute place to bring your kids for dessert after eating in downtown Willoughby. They have a variety of bakery items and my daughter loves loves the decorated cookies. They are amazing. They have a variety of treats and if course coffee for the parents.  The four starts was given because my husband and I have had lunch here multiple times and didn't enjoy our meals."}
{"text":"Took my son in there for a hot chocolate...he's 6.  I told him that this place has the BEST hot chocolate...to which the barista responded \"Uh.  Yeah.  That what you want?\"  Which made me question his choice of employment in the field of customer service.  Had a poor attitude.      My mocha was drinkable, but didn't have a whole shot in it I think.  Not a whole lot of coffee there.  Two rice krispie treats later we were out.  Not a whole lot of happiness in that place.  Maybe he had a bad day."}
{"text":"As far as relaxed hang-outs go in suburban Lake County, this is about as good as you're going to get. The coffee is better than average, there is a good amount of table space, and there is wifi."}
{"text":"Someone rightly said the service was horrible and the server had the personality of driftwood.. boy did he nail that down pat. Once you look past the prompt but curt service where you are given the notion that you are an inconvenience to the staff it's a pretty decent place.  I just had a cafe au lait with a shot of espresso and to be honest it ain't nothing to write home about. Don't get me wrong this is not bad coffee just didn't suit my tastes and that's very subjective a measure.  The place was clean and tidy and they had a grand total of 4 people in at the time I went in , so they were not very busy ( which further perplexed me with the service ) So yea it seems like a nice quiet place to get a cuppa coffee but with another coffee shop two doors down you'd think they'd be not letting that service slack.  In all likelihood it should be a two star review but three it is because I think they can be better and probably the barista was having an off day ? Maybe ?"}
{"text":"This is my favorite coffee spot in Lorain County! I often meet with clients for coffee and want to mee in a social friendly place... Well, this is it! They have great food and awesome coffee. The atmosphere is \"wow\" with the large bay doors that open up the cafe to bring the outdoors inside (summer of course).  The live music they have is an added bonus in the evenings!"}
{"text":"Coffee is so-so, but they have a wonderful bakery with really good treats!!"}
{"text":"Excellent pastries - I haven't had one that I didn't love!  They have every flavor you can possibly thing of so add one or three to your next hot drink!  My favorite so far - Cinnamon coconut hot chocolate!"}
{"text":"Lots to choose from and a good place to have a conversation. Plenty of seating but from what I remember it can get crowded from time to time with it being the only place to get a cup of joe since The Enclave Closed sometime ago."}
{"text":"Total dump. Horrible service. Stale food. Tables need to be cleaned off more often. Instant coffee tastes as good as he coffee you'd get here which basically means the coffee here is dreadful. Nothing redeeming about this coffee shop."}
{"text":"This location was built for a \"show place\" for Arabica International clients to see how we do it! So expect a pristine well to do environment!  Service was over the top & I would def frequent this place when in town..  Menu offers breakfast, lunch, & dinner. Kiedrowski's bakery items offered & Faroh's speciality candy ;)   Check it out!"}
{"text":"I like this spot.  Nice laid back vibe, good coffee too.  The pastries are pretty standard commercial stuff, the food menu limited but hearty.  Great vegetarian chili.  Downtown Willoughby has a \"Mayberry\" like feel to it, but if you go down Vine Street, your in a scene from the movie \"Deliverence\"."}
{"text":"I've been going there for years and I've always enjoyed it. But there is a tall guy with brown hair who works their now that I have no idea how he even has a job. He's nasty to customers, he's been a bitch to me everytime I've seen him and I've heard him being insulting to other people on more than one occasion. The only time he doesn't sound like he's being a total fucking asshole is when he's talking obnoxiously loud to other employees. He makes the entire place feel unpleasant when he's there, I don't understand how he got the job and is still allowed to work there."}
{"text":"Needed a place to work for most of the day. Arabica had good Wi-fi, plentiful outlets, and enough tables that nobody should ever be left wanting for a place to sit. Despite the large space, it manages to feel cozy. The food is good, the coffee is good, and the music selection while I was there was top notch!"}
{"text":"I think the coffee here is actually pretty good and a definitely cheaper than Starbucks. The staff seem to be typical barista Hipster wannabes however, and seem more interested in their iPhones than customers"}
{"text":"The coffee might be OK and the pastries might be ok, the atmosphere is excellent but they have no interest or desire in making anything good with Espresso.   I've been coming in here, annually, for the last several years hoping it would improve. It doesn't. Even after skimming off the froth with a spoon, the taste and texture was so poor that I just left it on the counter. Ruined my day, (I'm sure it will get better), hence this review.  Their cappuccino is served in a tall glass tumbler, a step up would be the cardboard cup, of about 12 ounces by first pouring it full of steamed milk and frothy foam like whipped egg whites and then pouring some crema free Espresso over it  Gentle suggestions and requests don't really help and  met with indifference  bordering on annoyance.  There are several places popping up about town that seem to get it and are jettisoning the typical method of espresso,  drinks  being 12 to 16 ounces of steamed milk, over bitter tasting coffee, and are producing excellent italien style espresso drinks."}
{"text":"Ordered a turkey and Swiss wrap What I got was a bunch of greens and a bit of cut up (not shredded) cheese and a MINISCULE amount of turkey!!!  When I called to complain the man that answered was very blasé and said we have a lot of customers who like us!!!!!!    Great attitude.....NOT.......    Won't go back"}
{"text":"Beautiful place, great coffee , and horrible service. No smiling baristas here... Awesome pastries and cute cookies."}
{"text":"When I think of the ideal coffee shop (great specialty drinks, tasty pastries, ample seating and a comfortable conversational level) I think of Arabica. Yes, this is the Arabica of my youth so I'm biased because its what I grew up on (and how my love of coffee began), but the downtown Willoughby location is just so...cute darnit. The old-fashioned downtown main street begins with Arabica.  I'm only giving my old standby 4 stars just because sometimes I've visited and the pastry isn't as fresh as I would have hoped for...well that's nothing that a little mocha can't help really."}
{"text":"it's a must stop if in Willoughby and want coffee any hour!   Get the nutty Irishmen or the Iced White Mocha... I've been going since 1998 :). I love it!!!   Try to get the sofa in the front window!"}
{"text":"Four stars for the buckeyes that they seem to always have. I am partial to them. I will walk to the end of this street for the sole purpose of buying one. Got it?  From what I understand this is a neighbourhood staple that people love in part because of nostalgia, but the bigger part of the draw is the casual and welcome feeling they get to hang back and stay for a while..charming!  I must comment, however, that the coffee is sometimes a hit or miss. We've had times when we get a spot on cup o joe and other times when the coffee tastes watery/weak. Sometimes if I order a small cup of specialty coffee (such as White mocha) I find that half the time the proportion of sweetness can be overwhelming. This might depend on who happens to be your barista.   I am still trying different items from here and next door's Fiona's. So far service is quite nice from both establishments but neither has yet to give me that robust roast that satisfies both a good balance of smooth boldness and nuttiness. (Yelpers, does either roast on site?) I sense that the competition has to ante up with these two literally shoulder to shoulder, neck to neck in terms of location, with only a bar in between (wild goose).  I don't think you have to love one over the other, the awareness that the other exsists just a door away just results in better and better coffee for everyone I think :) and no worries, there's always room for great coffee and sweets in these parts. I think both can be sustained by new and old patrons alike and that makes for more community sociability."}
{"text":"I've stopped into this shop every now and then since i went to school down the street in the mid 90's. Great location, classic coffeehouse decor and pleasant people. We had gelato there Sunday morning while walking the pooch. What a nice treat to have available for people who are not into eggs and sausage every Sunday. The coffee is the same mediocre product all Arabica's have been shoving down our gullets for the last twenty years, but that's okay. It's cheaper than Starbucks.   Holy shit, i forgot the most important detail. This was where i first had a one on one sit down with my future wife. Not a date mind you, just hanging out.  I kind of resent this place too. It was grunge loser central during high school. Cue Lemonheads song....."}
{"text":"love the inside of arabica but the staff has no sense of urgency, which is not a good quality when running a restaurant. we waited over an hour for our eggs and toast and they we not slammed. we got our food and it was good but not worth the wait. my advice would be to hire people who don't take forever to take your order and prepare your food."}
{"text":"We love this place. Nothing like looking at downtown Willoughby Christmas lights and enjoying coffees and chai and green tea and delicious pastries we love that despite being kicked out for another coffee shop and being told leave in 30 days..they reopened 2 doors down and still great service and same great teas and coffee .."}
{"text":"We were visiting my boyfriend's brother who lives nearby and I needed a place to do some work. Their breakfast bagels were very good and I had a cup of their Aztec black bean soup, which was lovely. The only problem we had was that the barista had such a giant chip on her shoulder that I thought she'd fall over from the weight - the other girls were nice though."}
{"text":"It's Arabica! Remember when it was Thinkers?? I'm old. So I am not as impressed with Arabica anymore. But teens and tweens love it. Just like I loved it when I was a teen. Bikers seem to love it too. Just like when I loved it when I was a biker. Their food is overpriced. The bakery is hit or miss. The mocha seems pre-made from a jug. Are you a teenager??? You would love it! Do you have 4+$ to drop for mediocre specialty coffee? You should go. Isn't DTW lookin' cute these days? Yes go to Arabica and sit outside. Are you a biker? Your friends are waiting."}
{"text":"Arabica has awesome open mic nights on Fridays sometimes, and the coffee is great too.  The space is cozy and the owners and employees are friendly.  This one dude with dreadlocks went out of his way to make sure I got what I wanted.  Great customer service!"}
