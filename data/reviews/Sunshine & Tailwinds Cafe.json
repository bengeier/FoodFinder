{"text":"The Sunshine & Tailwinds Café is AWESOME. I have waited to comment till now. Didn't want to base my comments/recommendation on only a couple of experiences. The value of recommendations to me is huge and word of mouth is the best advertisement you  could ever receive.  Well, here it goes. Just finished my 12th meal. As all the previous ones it was Absolute Prefection. From the Atmosphere when you top the stairs, the View out of the Widows or off the Patio, the Smiling Face/Faces of the staff when greeting you, the other Customers seem to even have an upbeat Ora about them. Now for the all-important cuisine. The food is Presented with Caring, it is very Apealing as if it was prepared by an artist, the Taste is absolutely as it appears GREAT,  the portions not small by any means yet not so large that you feel stuffed or guilty that you did not finish. Price; normal menu, extremely reasonable, even more so when you take into consideration, You Are on an Airport, then there are the Specials even more reasonable, and they are always unique. Not just a smaller portions. Real Specials and wonderful to try. The whole experience has an overall Feeling, along the line, from the television series Cheers theme song \"Where everybody knows your name\". Hope you have the opertunity to experience it for yourself. Sunshine & Tailwinds Café Highly has my Recommendation. Also take note that the comments above I heard from other customers as well. Not just a couple, in excess of 20. GA"}
{"text":"Just ate at the new Sunshine  and Tailwinds Cafe at the North Las Vegas Airport and I have to say the breakfast was delicious. The portion of food  was perfect. And the staff were  so friendly it makes you  feel like  home. Vegas, if you haven't  discovered  this little  gem of a diner yet, you  have no idea what you've been  missing all  this time. There are  lots of eating places  in this  town but none with the friendly faces  of the  family owned  and operated Sunshine and Tailwinds Cafe, located on the second level  of the North Las Vegas Airport terminal."}
{"text":"I used to go to the old location on Decatur and decided to try the new airport location with the family. The service was excellent as it has always been.  I ordered the pioneer breakfast with ham..... I was really disappointed in the o'brien potatoes I ordered, it looked a one spoon scoop and the slice of ham was not impressive neither... (canned). We were really excited to try the place as I bragged about the quality of food that they used to serve. The prices are not high, but for the price I paid for that breakfast, I was not satisfied."}
{"text":"Fresh, hand formed burgers. Better than 1/3 pound after cooking. Fresh veggies on top with the option for chilies.  Amazing burger for the money.  Potato salad was good and fresh. I would have preferred a little more mustard in the mix but that is a matter of taste. Will be coming back to try the breakfast!"}
{"text":"I drive past the nice NLV airport to and from work everyday and see the sign for Sunshine and Tailwinds everyday, especially when that Airport Drive light changes to red for NO REASON. We were looking for a place to have a nice breakfast and the reviews were good so we pulled the trigger and stopped in. Been there 2 weeks in a row, first with my BFF and then with the wife and didn't disappoint. I love airplanes and airports so the decor gets 7 stars from me. Not expensive at all and the food is delicious. Have only had breakfast items, omelettes and chicken fried steak and they were cooked perfectly. Have a full lunch and dinner menu, too. Staff was very friendly as well. It's nice and quiet. The tables and chairs are a little worn but give the little cafe a sense of identity and character in my option and I love it. Go take a walk out on the observation deck. I was surprised how many planes were coming and going. Who are those people on a private jet coming in or leaving? Fun stuff to think about. The best part is the old timers hanging out. Over hearing their stories a little bit is a hoot. A lot of the patrons seem to know each other and will say hi and joke around a little. So it's a nice little community. Breakfast time has been excellent, we had a good time and the food hits the spot. I highly recommend stopping in, checking it out and grabbing a bite. Best part is that you see some planes and it's NOT McCarran or in a casino!"}
{"text":"So glad we found the Sunshine Cafe at its new location! We went to the old location many times and were sad to see it go. I had almost forgotten about it until I saw a sign near the North Las Vegas Airport advertising the Sunshine & Tailwinds Cafe. Although the name is a bit different, it's the still the great comfort food that we knew and loved.  My husband had the special: grilled pork chop with eggs and hash browns. That was one tasty chop. (Actually, two!) I had a ham and swiss omelet with hash browns. Can't really go wrong with that. The menu is pretty limited, but I guarantee you will find something to your liking.  Prices are reasonable, and there's a nice family-friendly vibe. You can tell many of the customers are regulars, and even if you're new (or haven't visited in awhile), you'll feel like you're eating at your grandma's--even if your grandma's isn't surrounded by the sights and sounds of incoming/outgoing planes.  I love the new location, and now that we've rediscovered it, I'm sure we'll be back for more tasty food and more sweet views from the observation deck."}
{"text":"First time visiting this gem and I'm glad my husband and I did. Great prices for what you get. Rather eat here than IHOP any day. Excellent service and you get your food Hot. Not the best breakfast food, but it does taste like home cooked laid back food."}
{"text":"I'm quite pleased with this restaurant at the North Las Vegas airport. I ordered a breakfast bagel cream cheese sandwich. It came with two eggs, cheddar cheese, and a sausage patty. Elsa have other choices, but the Senators large, feeling, and fully satisfying to my taste buds. There was almost no delay with food production, and while eating I enjoyed the spectacular view of helicopters and airplanes taxiing across the runways. The prices or fair and I'd recommend this to any resident looking to switch up their normal breakfast routine."}
{"text":"I had a couple great breakfasts here. Always fun to watch the planes. The food is good, prices reasonable and the staff is top notch."}
{"text":"Customer service fantastic! Observation deck tremendous! Chef gracious! Our food a bit over-cooked."}
{"text":"We just moved to town, and were very happy to find this restaurant! Great food, reasonable prices, and friendly service. A hidden gem in the Vegas Valley!"}
{"text":"Needed somewhere nearby to have a quick business brunch, found Sunshine & Tailwinds on Yelp and gave it a whirl.  Zero fancy anything... Just a good little breakfast/lunch place overlooking runways at NLV airport. Food was great, servers were friendly and efficient.  Not \"restauranty\" feeling... More dining hall... Can't quite put my finger on it. It was a really nice change from the norm and the food really was awesome. Fresh and cooked well.  We'll be going back."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate breakfast at this restaurant and we totally loved it. The bacon and eggs were excellent!  We really enjoyed the view of airplanes taking off with the beautiful mountains in the background.  This is an excellent Resturant for any occasion.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Yummy.  Very friendly. Great service . Great portions. Ambiance is nice! So happy to be invited back."}
{"text":"Great little hidden gem.  Went there for breakfast and it was so good.  Had the ham omelet with cheddar cheese and homefries.  The staff was very nice and on the ball.  Great view as you get to watch the planes."}
{"text":"We frequently go here for breakfast and it's never a disappointment. Staff is very friendly and the food is always amazing. Great little place!"}
{"text":"So glad to see the Sunshine Cafe back!  The BEST place for breakfast.  Having breakfast with the Daylite Chapter breakfast crew."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Flew in for lunch with my girlfriend and tried it out. Watched the planes as we sipped on coffee and ate a delicious breakfast. Service was incredible except for one employee who kept swearing in the bar area. Didn't like that at all."}
{"text":"Sunshine Cafe rocks! Best place to go for breakfast! Glad they found a home. Mulligans was ok, but this location is much better!"}
{"text":"Excellent service!! With great food and prices. I am glad they reopened the restaurant here at the airport, it's relaxing to watch the planes and eat."}
{"text":"Fantastic all American menu with airport burgers, salads, soups and country breakfasts to dinners."}
{"text":"I had coffee, hash and scrambled eggs with a side of bacon.  Everything was delicious.  I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were very pleased to see the owners of the old Sunshine Cafe moved into the 2nd floor of the NLV Airport Terminal. Fabulous service. Same great food. Lots of room and a big parking lot. We'll be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Very much a \"locals\" place. Great for breakfast, have never tried lunch or dinner.  Seating overlooks the airport runways.  Friendly staff, basic food well prepared & reasonable prices. This restaurant is located on the 2nd floor of the North Las Vegas airport terminal"}
{"text":"This little restaurant is the best hidden gem I've seen in Vegas. I lived in Vegas at the time of this review for 17 years and finally found a place where you can get a great cup of coffee and able to watch the airplanes fly by. The food is spectacular and the best grits in Las Vegas, I'll be going back again with friends!"}
{"text":"Great place to go have a nice relaxing breakfast or lunch while watching planes. Good traditional American food reasonably priced.  The Benedict is awesome."}
{"text":"This is a great little place at the North Las Vegas Airport.  It's got a simple menu, a small diner/mom and pop feel to it, an awesome view of the airfield, food is always cooked great, and the price is extremely affordable.  My wife and I have been coming here now for nearly every weekend, for about six months.  One of my favorites is their Eggs Benedict, as whoever their cooks are, these guys know how to properly poach an egg.  And the sauce!  Er mer gerd... don't get me started.  Or the gravy... not too heavy, but incredibly flavorful.  And I dig how they put the food on a bed of gravy, as opposed to the gravy on the food.  I don't know why, but it just seems better.  Even the corn beef hash; you can tell it's out of can, but again, whoever cooks it up knows how to cook it and spruce it up and make it something awesome.  Definitely need to try this once if you're in the area.  While we go mostly for breakfast, we've tried their lunch and dinners and both are just as good (actually had a phenomenal steak for dinner, so maybe dinner is a little better... so hard to tell!)."}
{"text":"Good food, nice service and a great view!  Will be back.  It's nice to have a good spot on the airport, come support this biz"}
{"text":"This is a little hidden cafe. You have a beautiful overlook of the airplane and helicopters from the cafe. The portions are generous and extremely hearty. If you're on a diet beware, because there isn't very many diet safe options. Not vegan friendly from what I saw.   I ordered the buffalo wings with the spicy fries. The chicken was alright, but nothing that will bring me back. The sauce had a little sting to it, but flavorful. The fries were not spicy, although the name suggests it, and very crispy. The fries were my favorite part of my meal. The house ranch had a light consistency, but not too thin.   It looks like they have daily specials. The current one was \"pancake, waffle, or French toast breakfast $6.95.\"   The space is intimate and can be accommodating for medium groups. There are model planes hanging from the ceiling and beautiful photographs of planes on the walls.    In conclusion, the rest of my group had mixed reviews of their visit. One person at the table got some sort of nachos and they didn't look very good. They looked like a pile of stuff was dumped on them. You might like those nachos if you are into a lot of toppings. I'd say if you're in the area it's a decent little cafe to get something to fill you up with. It's out of the way and not in my area, so I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to go eat there.  Overall; A-OK"}
{"text":"Stopped by for food before my helicopter ride and it is a little cute diner with a nice menu selection. They offer the typical diner food from wings, fries, burgers and shakes. Upon entering, it was extremely empty with just one table occupied but I didn't mind since this airport is overall very empty. My group and I decided to sit at the counter to make it easier for the waitress and we wanted a nice view of the planes and helicopters coming in/out. We ordered a bacon cheeseburger and chili cheese fries.  Bacon Cheeseburger- it was quite dry but I didn't expect much to begin so was ok with it. The fries were yummy and fresh out of the fryer.   Chili Cheese Fries- Never had them before but I've always been a fan of Chili and am a fries fanatic so... it was a match made in heaven! I'm not sure why I've never ordered this dish anywhere else before but since my friend got it, I tried it out. It was delicious! Makes me want to order it more often when out. I mainly ate the chili cheese fries since my burger was pretty dry.  Overall this place is a cute little diner and I recommend it if you're at the N. Las Vegas Airport. I wouldn't go out of my way for this cafe but I'll be sure to stop by during my next helicopter ride! The customer service is excellent and I know since it may not get too busy, they enjoyed our company."}
{"text":"Really nice young guy who is busing tables and doing a little of everything else. Food was good. Had my standby corned need hash and eggs, da Hunny had the Texas chili omelet (chili was Hormel chili from a can - come on, chili isn't that hard to make, is it?) were hoping to be able to sit outside, they have a fantastic deck, just need some tables and umbrellas, - 5 stars just for that alone. We sat next to the kitchen, so a little noisier, but the tossing of the dirty dishes in the bins was super loud and distracting and didn't make for an overly pleasant experience. Will be back for lunch, the burger looked really good."}
