{"text":"It's a typical québécois diner with typical diner food.  Big portions.  The smoked meat is good and so are the ribs.  Pizza is not bad, good old sous-marins.  Nothing to rave about but nothing awful.  It does the job if you're in the mood for this kind of food.

Clean place.  Washrooms are clean, service is friendly."}
{"text":"The last time before we came here was about a year ago, and my sister really wanted to come back, so we decided to have a nice family dinner at a restaurant.

The service was friendly, as always, and we were graciously welcomed inside.

Now, the food.

I had the breaded filet of sole, so that is what I'll be reviewing.

First , the salad that comes with it: the dressing is absolutely delicious & the veggies are nice and fresh. If I could describe it in one word, it will be, well, fresh!
Now, the actual fish.
The breading is really nice, crispy, but a little tough. The fish is really good.
The fish also comes with vegetables, rice  and tartar sauce.
Rice: Delicious! It's nicely cooked and really flavourful 
Tartar sauce : wow! It was really, really good! It was tangy, and pickely, and just really good!
Vegetables: this was the only downfall of my dish, as the veggies were extremely bland. There was no flavour whatsoever.

I also sampled the chicken souvlaki brochette and it was really good too

I also had a sundae, and it was really good, cause, ya know, you can't really mess up a sundae.
This place also has awesome pizza. 

All in all, a really good restaurant."}
{"text":"Rien à surprendre l'imaginaire, ce resto nous console par sa cuistance familière et son caractère générique. Et alors? 

Les tables sont charitablement espacées et le menu se lit d'une nomenclatute si facile à la bouche. Mon assiette de souvlaki est présenté avec tous les suspects usuels. Le riz à la gauche, les frites un peu tassées avec la verdure et le porc, bien au centre."}
{"text":"Years ago I had breakfast at Delicia and I recallit was ok. A friend of mine raved about how good their  pizza was so I decided to join my friend for supper& it was late but de were still received. The staff is friendly, the place is very clean. Now the food! We ordered the house pizza had smoke meat, it was all right, the dough was thin but thick around the edges. My friend liked it a lot but I personally tasted better. De also ordered chicken wings. I was highly disappointed! The BBQ sauce was cold out of the fridge. The wings were dull & lacked zestiness. Would I go black for supper? Maybe but not before à while."}
{"text":"This very very very low key restaurant has amazing food at a low price. Beware from ordering menu of the day as it traps you for dessert, although it gives you dessert."}
