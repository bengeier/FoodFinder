{"text":"This neighborhood thai restaurant has the best red curry, absolutely delicious! Very clean, great service. Love the lunch specials, and they have a big menu with lots of tasty dishes to choose from."}
{"text":"I found this place by accident but it was the very best Thai food that I've ever had . The Red Curry with Chicken was Phenomenal !!!"}
{"text":"After eating Thai meals around the world, including at some of the finest Thai restaurants in the US, Krachai is by far the very best we've had in Arizona.  Other supposed Thai restaurants in Phoenix pale in comparison.  Krachai, a small family-owned, family-operated restaurant, serves fresh ingredients in a friendly, hospitable environment.  Service is efficient.  Cuisine is authentic Thai \"home cooking.\"  Highly recommend the Spring Rolls, Chicken Satay, Basil Fish, and Duck Ka Prow.  Love that they don't charge for refills of Thai Ice Tea.  Visit Krachai and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We finally found \"our Thai restaurant!\" Hubby and I have been on the hunt for a really good Thai restaurant in the NW Valley for a number of years. We have tried several that received good customer reviews - all disappointing to us. Some were average at best and the rest were downright YUCK. We wondered who were giving such good reviews of such dismal tasting Thai food. We were losing hope that there existed a good Thai restaurant near us, and were nearly resigned to the fact we would have to go to Scottsdale for our Thai food fix, and pay inflated prices. Then last weekend we ate at Krachai Thai Kitchen. How this place was not on our radar is beyond me, and I am so happy we found it! We ordered the Pad Thai and Yellow Curry, both with chicken, at a spice level of 2 (their scale is 1-5). We just knew when our dishes arrived at our table we were in for a real treat. The Pad Thai was perfect. Every noodle coated with the sauce. Not a gloppy mess, not dry and gummy - perfect. The spice level did make hubby ask that a pitcher of water be left at the table. The Yellow Curry was just the right consistency. Not watery, not too thick - and a very pleasing deep yellow color. It had my favorite combination of potatoes, onion, and carrot. Not some weird green bell pepper, zucchini, or baby corn thrown in like other places. Service was good, prices were very fair for what you got, and the restaurant was very clean. We already did a takeout order of the same two dishes the other night, this time with a spice level of 1. Again - perfection! We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"The pad thai was a disappointment.  But the pad see eww, I don't think that's the right spelling, was really good but medium spicy is only for the brave lol. It was so hot, but really good.  The spring rolls were not the greatest but the sweet sauce was amazing."}
{"text":"The green curry was the best I've ever had, even gives the option for how spicy the curry can be"}
{"text":"It was my first time here, I had 2 diners with me for lunch so our time was short.  The place is clean and the waitress was friendly and helpful.  I was starving so chicken satay was first up, the pieces were big but could have been more tender. They tasted great though and the traditional cucumber and peanut sauces were also excellent.  I had chicken yellow curry off the lunch menu.  The curry was served in a side bowl but was rich so more was not needed.  For $6.95 your lunch has soup, egg roll and wonton chips plus a big ball of rice and the side bowl of curry full to the brim.  Chicken red curry was also ordered same specials same great quality.  The veggies in the red were crisp and delightful. As far as heat level goes , medium had some zing and hot made me sweat a little.  In other words exactly as it should be.  I will be going back for dinner some time so I can try some of the other curries of course !!"}
{"text":"I have ordered krachai pineapple fried rice and I liked it very much. I even went again in a week and ordered the same thing . Price is also not bad"}
{"text":"I LOVE Thai food, and have eaten at many Thai restaurants. This is by far one of the absolute best places I have ever been! The food is fresh, authentic, and fabulous! I would recommend this little place to anyone who loves Thai food!!! Hands down awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good and stay is very nice. Ive had the pad Thai, green curry, spicy noodles, and many other dishes. They were delish. I recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"We were a parry of seven with five Asians and the consensus was an exceptional cuisine and service.  We had over seven different dishes we shared and they were all just perfect so no need to suggest any particular dish  .. Any type that suits you I'm sure will be tasty.  The server was very attentive with proper settings with dishes and soup bowl. Definitely worth a return trip."}
{"text":"We love Thai food and it's hard to find a place that is consistently great. We found that here. Their Green Curry is luscious and silky. We always ask for Vegetable  Green Curry with Chicken and we get tons of veggies--broccoli, eggplant, squash bamboo shoots--not just onions and peppers.   Also do the same with Tom Ka Gai which is outstanding  and a  perennial fav of mine. There grilled pot stickers are another knockout.  And  to me just as important as the food -this place is super CLEAN. It may not be the closest Thai restaurant to our house but we consider it our neighborhood restaurant. Can't beat it."}
{"text":"What a great find! We had relatives in from out of town who wanted Thai, and came in based on other Yelp reviews. Glad we did! Friendly service and lots of leftovers. We will be back!"}
{"text":"So glad we found this place.  The staff was SO friendly, very accommodating to my vegetarian diet, and the food was delicious!  My bf and I started out with spring rolls and fried tofu. Both were great. Best part was the clear noodles and curry.   Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I went to this place with my best friend the other night and we got the combo appetizer plate ! it was alright but too many fried things for my liking! I ordered the seafood salad and there were more fried food on it that I was quickly tired of the meal. I think it would have been a lot tastier without that appetizer first! on top of that, the waitress didn't ask me whether or not I had wanted it spicy or not! I had forgotten and was sad because I had wanted that extra kick ! I will give this place another try and update on my next visit!"}
{"text":"We discovered this place a few months ago and have been back several times since.  While I'm sure there is better Thai food to be found out there, maybe even here in the Valley, they've yet to fail in satisfying us when in the mood for good Thai food.  Personally I tend to get the curries - I rotate between the musamun, red and panang curries - and they are always satisfying.  I'm something of a spice fanatic but I will say that if you tell these guys you want your curry spiced \"Thai hot\" they take it seriously.  Good stuff!  My wife has tried various dishes here as well, from the pad see ew to the lard nha and everything in between - and has yet to be let down.  The kids' menu is simple and the portions are generous, our 5 year old has even asked for this place by name before!    The location and ambiance is simple enough.  Nothing fancy but it is clean and pleasant.  It tends not to be too busy either, at least not the times we have come.  The service can be inconsistent depending on who is working, though the only complaints we've had is with some of the younger girls who seem to have their friends over and spend more time giggling and gossiping in the corner than attending to customers.  Recommended if you're looking for good Thai food (or just something different) in the North Valley."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Thai food so I had to try this place out. After walking in i totally felt welcomed as was quickly greeted by the friendly staff, my fianc√© ordered the Tom Yum soup and it was delicious, I had the Fried Rice with chives and crab meat and can't complain either, the food was great, the service was excellent. Also, their Thai tea is really good. I will definitely be back in the near future."}
{"text":"Tried the Panang curry and it was excellent.  My wife had the mango curry special and loved it as well.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"The place smells delicious, staff are very friendly and the food is amazing I don't know which is my favorite but I will definitely be back to try the Pad Thai!"}
{"text":"Mighty fine and authentic Thai food at reasonable prices and excellent service although language barrier was a bit of a challenge. Reminded me of my experience in Thailand. They are excellent at dialing spice level to your needs."}
{"text":"Fabulous food,  fabulous service!   Pretty restaurant and wonderful family-owned business.   We were staying at the nearby Embassy Suites and decided to give it a try.  Highly recommend green papaya salad,  mussamun chicken curry and spicy noodles.  My three teens loved it,  as did my husband and I.  Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I have dined here quite a few times. And I love this place, their food is great and consistent. I recommend this to all my friends."}
{"text":"The spicy noodle and chicken noodle are really good here. I usually order it to go. I've tried a few other places in the west valley but this is my favorite Thai place!"}
{"text":"Funny story, our first time here we ordered pad Thai but for some reason it was served extremely spicy. We felt bad that we couldn't eat it and reordered it. The mild version turned out to be amazing! Have been back several times and we make sure to order mild and it's one of our favorite places now! Best family run Thai in the area."}
{"text":"Food is good. Staff is fine as well. I have been here a couple of times. Fish is lovely.  Three stars because They billed me wrong. I did not realize it until I saw the credit card statement. And that Might be too late to ask for any refund or anything."}
{"text":"Tried this place tonight for takeout and thought the quality was very good. We had difficulty viewing the menu online so just described to the woman over the phone what we wanted. We ordered pineapple curry with chicken, stir fried glass noodles with shrimp and saut√©ed spicy eggplant with steamed tofu, I'm not sure the proper names for these dishes. The price was good, about what we pay on average for Thai around Phoenix. When my husband called in the order, he at first didn't specify the level of spice, so he called back and specified medium. I swear they must have thought we wanted double spice since we called back because our food was spicy! I love spicy food, usually eat Serrano peppers with most savory meals and the food was borderline uncomfortable for me to eat.  My husband ended up mixing a lot of rice with small amounts of each entree so he could tolerate it.  I'm thinking they made a mistake.  Anyway, it was still delicious and we will order from here again, but we'll play around with the spice level to suit our tastes."}
{"text":"I loved this place when it open the woman who ran it was friendly and the service was wonderful. I recommend it to everyone.  A few months ago it seemed to of changed the woman wasn't there anymore and the food tasted different.  We have been back several times but it still didn't taste the same. I asked if they had a new cook and yes they changed cook. It seems they have another location in surprise!  And I guess they switch.  Well I sure hope they switch back. Its still ok but other cook and woman that was there was much better. Oh and the prices went up when the change was made. 5 stars for old 3 for New."}
{"text":"Always come here for pad thai and Spicy noodles. Great portions, service and taste! I moved downtown and I still drive back up here for thai food."}
{"text":"This is by far and away my favorite Thai restaurant. I have been coming here with my friends for over a year.  It started as a place we went to every couple of weeks,  but now we frequent here once or twice a week. Everything I have tried is delicious. The family that runs the place always greets us with a smile and quick to get us our drinks. Do yourself a favor and visit here. You will be glad you did."}
{"text":"I am going to give this a 2 star only because there were roaches around the place.  the food was pretty good."}
{"text":"I am a huge Thai fan, and I tried their thom ka gai soup... Oh my god SOGOOD. I used to live in Bloomington and their was this Thai place that made the best soup and I have been searching everywhere for another place to chow at... I will be eating here again and come back for more SOUP"}
{"text":"Great little restaurant.  Friendly service, clean and some great Thai food.  I'm happy this place is close to my house."}
{"text":"Some of the worst service I've had in a long time, clearly understaffed. Plan on waiting forever to get your food, and good luck talking to anyone once it's been delivered. It's a shame, the food was not bad. The curry was missing some of the ingredients that were on the menu and if i don't order chicken, don't put it in my soup."}
{"text":"The past 6 times that I have been here have been spot on. Some of the friendliest customer service I've ever received from an Asian restaurant. The pad Thai is delicious and for under $10 you get more than a lot of the places around, for a cheaper price! Definitely my go to for Thai food. Clean environment too"}
{"text":"I am so disappointed right now. so disappointed in the fact that I live so far away from this place. This food is phenomenal and the service is on point!"}
{"text":"Pat se ew and pad Thai. SO GOOD! Very good service. Very good food. Very decent price! The lunch special comes with soup and a spring roll. So delicious. This place is our new favorite!"}
{"text":"We loved this family owned restaurant. The owners are Thai so there is a bit of a language gap, but they are so friendly.   My husband ordered the pepper steak and I got Pad Thai, both were absolutely delicious. Great sized portions, obviously homemade, and clean authentic flavors.   The restaurant is immaculate, service was quick and friendly, and the food was absolutely delicious. We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"2nd or 3rd time eating here. Ordered the red curry with vegetables and the fresh rolls one order of shrimp and one order of veggies. Ok the fresh rolls were ok not outstanding just ok. The sauce for the fresh rolls was good. What i didnt care for was the price 6.95 for the shrimp and 4.95 for the veggier. For what you get even thou they were tastey thats too pricey. Now the red curry flavour was fine and they spiced it thai hot the way i like it. The big dissappointment was the vegetables; Not many, and what vegetables their were were all sliced tinnie tiny. Broccoli, carrots and green beans. Sliced so tiny and small.that you r left feeling like youve been teased. And then when you finish eating  your left with hunger pains. Again anothe thai restaurant that leaves some thing significant to be desired. I would possibley go back to eat at Krachai if i was in the neighboughhood. I just wouldnt go out of my way to go there.   I must add that the staff well the gentelman waitier was very curteous, attentive and firendly. A++ on that."}
{"text":"The food here is great... First time coming here. Very impressed with the pot stickers.. We even ordered a second plate. My friend ordered the curry and I ordered the spicy noodles. We both got a spice level of four and let me tell ya.. This place makes their food SPICY. So order accordingly. The food was fresh and came out quick. The spicy noodles could of used maybe a little more veggies.. The only reason we took off a star is because the service was crappy. And the tables were dirty (we had to move to three tables before we found a semi-decent clean one). The hostess was on her snapchat when she was ringing us up and having us pay. The cook seemed annoyed that we wanted a second order of pot stickers. Otherwise, it would of been a 5/5."}
{"text":"I had the pepper beef. Perfect balance of flavor and pepper. High quality ingredients. They offer lunch deals for $8. I'm looking forward to my next visit. PS, they have wifi."}
{"text":"Great good and fast service. Fantastic lunch deals at $7.99 includes soup and egg roll! Definitely coming next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Delicious Thai food at a reasonable price. I ordered the combo platter appetizer to start. So good and a lot of food! Main dish was a yellow curry, medium. Also delicious with sizable chunks of chicken and potatoes. Be warned that medium spicy is pretty dang spicy though!"}
{"text":"We are always looking for a great Thai restaurant. Our favorite one is in Scottsdale and we don't like driving so far. So we decided to give this one a try. They about 3. 1/2 stars. The phat Thai was ok nothing special ( I like egg in mine and this dish didn't come with eggs).We also ate the pa nang chicken which tasted good. Overall it's good but in my opinion not the best."}
{"text":"Our favorite little thai place close to home.  Clean restaurant, friendly staff, consistently great food!  Our go-to items are Spicy Noodle, Orange chicken, cashew chicken, spicy fried rice and potstickers.  We've tried several other items on the menu and they've all been good!"}
{"text":"Some of the hottest but tastiest Thai food in the US I've eaten has been in Phoenix.  If you order \"thai hot\" be prepared for what you get--but highly recommended and large portion sizes."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food at a great price. The food felt more authentic than your usual Thai place - medium spicy is spicy :) so watch out"}
{"text":"Wonderful dinner and service.  Four of us shared fresh spring rolls and fried tofu for appetizers.  then Tom Kha soup with Pa-Nang curry, eggplant, spicy Pad Khaprau.  Everything was VERY tasty.  We loved the friendly, cordial and properly attentive service.  A delightful evening of great food."}
{"text":"Just came for the first time & absolutely love it. My husband had Pepper Beef & I had Green Curry with chicken. Great experience all around. Please patronize them as they prepared food that certainly deserve buying. LOVED IT & We will be back."}
{"text":"Positive: The customer service was excellent. They were very friendly. We were both very unsure of what we wanted but ordered  number 30 under the entrees;   which was pad cashew .  The flavor was excellent,  very pleased with this dish. It came with white rice.  We also ordered number 40 under the Thai Noodle section and this was the Pad Wood Sen.   I like the glass noodles,  and the flavor on this dish was very mild. We saw a lot of people come and go, picking up there to go orders. And by 5 o'clock there was probably 4 more tables filled.   We will definitely be returning again   Negative : My friend and I arrived at 4:30 p.m. The doors were locked,  but when they saw us they opened them up. Slight amount of language barrier on asking questions, but extremely kind and friendly. Don't let this hinder you from trying this place."}
{"text":"This was excellent great for reasonable you can adjust the spice and heat 3 is a medium heat. We will be back. Try it and if you like Thai you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"I went here at lunch , and really like my meal. Had some time to kill that day, and the waitress set me up at a big table, because it had an out let. I had to play on my computer...But the lunch specials were reasonably priced. And I would go back again."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to come here for a while, because I just haven't found \"the\" Thai restaurant to love up here in NoPho.  We finally went for dinner on a Wednesday night and here's what I have to say!  First, because it's what you want to hear, the food was definitely 4 stars, and possibly 5 once we explore the menu on a return visit.  So please have no qualms with my 3-star rating, that's not for the food!  Husband enjoyed his beef noodle soup and I devoured my Pad Woon Sen.    I want this little place to succeed, since the food is excellent, but they are still working out kinks.  I think other Yelpers have said the same in other reviews.  The location is UGH, but at least the shop is up by the street and not as depressing as the dying strip mall behind it.  I'm just saying, not a place for a special date night in terms of the location.  This ain't Kierland.  The inside decor is adorable, VERY clean, modern.   Kudos for that, it does make them stand out in my mind.     Pricing seemed a bit high to me?  And finally, the service.  Very friendly, but it feels like the owners are making their family work there, as in the staff are not \"professional waiters.\"  There was a dude sitting there when we came in, waiting for take-out.  We sat down, ordered, and were already halfway thru our meal before his order ever appeared.  Yikes.  The waitress told him to call in next time, but that seems weird because if we were able to get our food so timely, why couldn't he?    Also, and maybe this is just me, but she brought my noodle dish in the usual serving platter, but I had to ask her outright to actually bring me a dinner plate and a serving spoon for the noodles.  She acted like that was  a new concept to her...hence that sense that the family members are just helping out...Asian restaurants serve food family style, so everybody gets a plate and there should be spoons in the serving dishes.  Right?  I dunno, it just seemed clumsy.  we will be back and I'm hoping that somebody there is reading all these reviews about the service.  I hope to give them 4 to 5 stars upon return!  [but I can't do anything about the creepy location.]"}
{"text":"We found this place after we moved to our new house and were looking for a place to eat close by.  We love Thai food but usually have to drive to Scottsdale to visit our favorite Thai restaurant; however, we decided to give this place a try.  We are glad we did.  Good food.  Good service.  Good prices.  The place is small, but both times we've been there, it hasn't been busy."}
{"text":"Never really been to a Thai place, so in the perspective of a newcomer it was pretty good. I had the lunch yellow curry and it was pretty tasty and flavourful. I also ordered a Thai tea which was a great value at $2.50 because they are usually at the $4.50 price range. I ordered duck for my meat and it was pretty good especially at its price point."}
{"text":"Great food!   Best Thai food I have found on the west side.   My wife and I picked up food for us and friends that just had a baby. We got a bunch of appetizers and main courses to try, all were great.   Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Really bad place, I ordered chicken and shrimp pad Thai and have 2 shrimp and 3 small pieces of chicken so disappointed"}
{"text":"found this place on yelp.went there on lunch time glad they did not close between3 to 5oclock like lots of thai restaurant does. service was good. small but place is clean,relax music. i ordered shrimp egg roll and  pad thai and desert coconut ice creamand sweet rice.it was good i could not eat it all so boxed up for dinner.shrimp roll was Little different from other thai restaurant it kind of small and fat they cut it in Middle.it just have very Little shrimp lots of vegs.but over all i am giving 4stars. i will come back agian if im in this side of town."}
{"text":"As seen by the photo I posted and you can see by the floor and seating it was taken here... As i was waiting for my lunch a juicy delicious roach ran around my foot at the table.  Needless to say, i am not coming back by this place...I am from out of town anyway, was on a business trip."}
{"text":"I love Thai food, but Karachai just fell flat for me. Their green curry is want very flavorful and the vegetables didn't seem super fresh. It wasn't bad, just not great. We did carry out so I can't really speak about their customer service, but our food wasn't ready when we got there and we had to wait an extra 15 minutes."}
{"text":"Best Thai Food! Every time I come here I love my food. I have not had a meal I haven't loved. Today we got the 39, 48 and 54. Love it. This is the best Thai food on this side of town. No need to try anywhere else. So worth the drive."}
{"text":"North Phoenix has long needed a really good Thai restaurant, and thank goodness this one came along to fill that niche. I love it when you have flavors which are bold but still allow you to identify the individual flavor notes, such as those of Thai basil and lemongrass, and this is exactly the complexity of the flavors of the dishes I've had here. The location is convenient (Greenway just east of 35th Av, near I-17), parking is never a problem, the restaurant is very clean and has a casual atmosphere, service is very friendly, and prices are about the same as you would find in most Thai restaurants."}
{"text":"Really great pad Thai. I didn't try anything else, and it was decent for a week day lunch in terms of price, volume, service, portions, and options. The serving I had was enough for a leftovers for later! Will be back to try it again!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Chicken Pad Thai around here. I asked for extra spicy and I finally got it with the best flavor and hardly any wait time.  The lady at the front was so sweet which makes this place even better."}
{"text":"Yum!!!! We tried this place tonight for the first time and it was amazing! We just returned from a trip to Bangkok a few months ago and this place satisfied the craving! The spicy basil chicken is really good and spicy eggplant as well. I don't think we got everything we ordered, but not being able to understand your server is part of a good foreign atmosphere :)"}
{"text":"Nice decorations inside of store.   We went for dinner last night. My friend got the Beef Salad, and I had the wonton soup.  The food came out rather quickly. My wonton soup was huge, a large bowl and it was steaming hot. My friends salad was heaped high with meat. He seemed to enjoy it, and as I waited for my steaming soup ( almost boiling hot), to cool off, I wished I had got the salad.  The vegetables in the wonton soup were colorful and crisp, but they didn't have any flavor. I tried to eat the crisp carrots on there own, but no flavor.  All in all, it was okay. I ate the pieces of meat and wontons in my soup, but the wontons were just there... Nothing great in the flavor of the minced pork. Perhaps add some ginger so when you bite into them it actually tastes good.  Will I be back? No, I don't think so.   Thai places in the Phoenix area are hit and miss. It has to be, really authentic, taste good and great customer service, for me to return."}
{"text":"Returned for another Thai dish. My wife tried the Mango salad. She was not impressed she gave it 1 out of 5 stars. I tried the Tom Yum soup which was good not great. We were disturbed due to the owners daughter not wanting to help.  She was asked to help bring water and drinks to the table since it was busy but she yelled I am doing my homework. Over and over this argument went on between her and the mother. The Spoiled brat wanted to watch her videos on her laptop rather than be of any assistance.  Unfortunately this will probably our last time ever going there. It was not an enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"Very good food forgot they had the coconut soup. Need to go back and try it. Service was very good"}
{"text":"I stopped here on a whim, wasn't expecting much, but the service, the food were outstanding. Came in for lunch on a Tuesday, and left very satisfied and happy, I may just have to keep coming back till I have tried the full menu."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Thai food I've ever had the Orange chicken is to die for it was not dry or extra saucy it was just right and it wasn't overly battered. A lot of places have more breading and batter than chicken. The pad thai was amazing. Even the white rice was nice and fluffy and the owners are super sweet. Food is awesome and fairly spiced. I definitely recommend this place my family and I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Friends and I decided on Thai food. Decided to try an entirely new place.  Clean.  Everyone was very friendly and helpful. Everything I ordered and sampled was excellent. Food was hot when it got to the table.  They will have a return customer."}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I found ourselves on the west side of town after taking a diving course. We picked this place on our lunch break because of Yelp. I got the green curry and he got the red curry, both with chicken. Absolutely delicious! Everything was fresh, and the spicy-ness level was just what we had asked for. Server was pleasant and restaurant was clean. Wished we lived closer so we could go back!"}
{"text":"Love papaya salad and fried rice and Thai tea here !!! Highly recommended! The guy working there he is really nice .He always make sure we happy with the foods."}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I came here on a Tuesday for lunch.  The woman greeted us and sat us, and took our order promptly. I ordered one of the lunch specials which was the red curry. It came with a clear broth soup, and an egg roll. We also ordered the wontons to start. Okay, so the food was delicious! The curry was served hot & not too spicy.  It was so filling and tasty. The service was fantastic! The woman who was our server was so sweet and attentive. The restaurant itself is on the smaller side, but cozy & beautifully decorated and most IMPORTANTLY, clean!! It wasn't too busy which I didn't understand why! Must be the location. If you get a chance though, check this place out!  Awesome awesome place. :)"}
{"text":"Great thai! Haven't had a bad meal here yet. Best thai food in Phoenix.  Everything is so fresh and the flavors explode in your mouth. I would highly recommend this local restaurant.  Pad thai,  phad kaprow, coconut curry are all top shelf. Plus great lunch specials"}
{"text":"There for lunch. Like the lunch menu and the pricing. Food tastes very good and the quantity is pretty good. Gets a 4 star instead of a 5 is because we had to wait for long last time for the waitress to come back and take the order from us. The thai coffee and tea are amazing here. Try it out."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful little gem we found in north phoenix. My husband and I ordered the Pad Thai and Pineapple Fried Rice. Both dishes were delicious! I especially enjoyed the fried rice because of plentiful amount of cashews it came with. Their menu seems to pretty big as well. We'll definitely be adding this to our list of go-to places."}
{"text":"We're always looking for a good Thai restaurant, especially in North Phoenix. I was torn between 3 stars and 4 so I went with the benefit of the doubt.   We came in last Saturday for lunch and the place was dead, we were the only two in there the whole entire time. Since we were there during prime lunch hours, that doesn't speak positively for the future of the restaurant.   I ordered grilled pot stickers with a side of vegetables and my boyfriend ordered Sweet and Sour Chicken. For what I paid, my food was good. James on the other hand, asked for his to be a level 3 on the spicy scale and it was only a 1. He's a HUGE fan of cucumbers in his Sweet and Sour Chicken, this only had 2 pieces and the rest of the dish wasn't fantastic. He said he would definitely order something else next time even though that's his go-to dish =\  My biggest issue was the water. It tasted HORRIBLE! It had a funky smell as well. I decided to just go thirsty, James however, purchased a Pepsi.    I do not understand why they have such great lunch specials during the week but they do not offer them on the weekends. I think we would definitely be willing to give it another chance (assuming their nasty water was a one time deal) but only if they had lunch specials on the weekends. They have no customers, what do they have to lose???"}
{"text":"I only had soup, the Tom Kha Gha. The floor was good but felt it lacked a bit of the complexity I have had with other Thai places. I still very much enjoyed it and would return again to try other options on the menu. It was very clean and the staff was attentive and prompt."}
{"text":"Pad Thai, Praful NA khaw and noodle soup were all very tasty.  Also try the coconut ice dessert which is amazing!"}
{"text":"The pad thai lunch deal is the bomb!!! Soup, vegi spring roll, and choice of entree for $8. We always order the chicken pad thai, the portions are substantial, but that doesn't qualify the 4 stars. The pad thai in my opinion is cooked to perfection! The sauce is is well balanced with that hint of vinegar!!! Our go to place for Thai lunch!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have had a hard time finding a Thai place that we LOVE on the West side. We stumbled upon Krachai Thai and are so glad that we did. The staff is very friendly, it is clean and comfortable feeling inside, nicely decorated. The food is fabulous! We have had the green curry, yellow curry, pineapple fried rice, pad thai, and the fresh spring rolls. Everything has been delicious and rivals some of our very favorite Thai places that we have ever been to. It is extremely well priced and they offer large portions that can easily feed 3 people per order. We will certainly be regulars at this place. Excellent..well worth the five stars!!"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and eat with these guys ASAP.  Had a thoroughly enjoyable experience with these fine people and absolutely loved the pot stickers and yellow curry.  Pot stickers are prepared by hand as they are ordered and they were on point.    Chicken yellow curry was superb. I really can't say enough about this dish so rather than bore you with words I'll leave it at superb. I opted for 5 stars out of five in terms of heat and chef did NOT disappoint. Hot AF is about the closest I can get to describing it.  The area is clean, neat and well appointed. Staff is well dressed and neatly kept.  Waiting to give the fifth star when I am back and the restaurant is busier so I can see them in action."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars  This restaurant is small but with a nice decor and is clean at the time of this review. A grade \"A\" Maricopa Health Inspection Sign is posted in the window.  We started with the fresh vegetable rolls that came out quickly with two tasty dipping sauces. The rolls were very crisp and very fresh and were stuffed with crisp iceberg lettuce salad and a basil leaf.  I had the stir fried eggplant with chicken. My plate had a nice selection of crisp fresh vegetables and moist chicken but the sauce was on the salty side and was a little more heat and salt than other flavors. I did order the heat level four out of five and I do have to say the number four is on the fiery side so most people will want to go lower than four on the heat scale.  My husband had the phad kaprow with beef. I tasted one piece of beef and it was tender and  overall good but lacked enough basil.  Service was speedy.  3.5 stars   I plan to try them again and pick different dishes that might be the specialties."}
{"text":"The food here was very good. It was fresh, tasty, and authentically Thai. We tried the beef salad, the beef pad see ew, chicken fried rice, and a few appetizers.  As a visitor from out of the area I didn't know what to expect here but decided to visit based on a quick Yelp search.   The service was not great and a little bit awkward, I'm pretty sure the guy that took our order and the other lady are not fluent in English so the communication was not the best. Another couple in the restaurant actually left after a brief interaction with the lady. I'm not sure exactly what was said but they left in a hurry and looked upset.  Other than that everything was fine and most importantly the food was good."}
{"text":"The food here was great. The server spoke very little English so he wasn't able to answer our questions or explain how their lunch special worked. This is a place that you go for the food, knowing that the service likely won't be great."}
{"text":"Ordered the pad see ew, and it was unbelievably bland! No flavor or spice, and almost no sauce. They used regular broccoli instead of Chinese broccoli and giant carrot chips. Very small portion for the price as well. I can't believe something so flavorless can be called Thai."}
{"text":"Great service and good food.  Enjoyed my spicy fried rice.  That's my go to at any new restaurant like this one.  Very good.  Great spice and good flavor.  Coconut milk soup served as part of your lunch.  First time I have seen that.  I'm a big fan of that soup and usually have to choose either the soup or a meal."}
{"text":"Great place, great food, great prices. I normally go to different places for lunch, but now I have made this place my once a week spot.  Staff is friendly and awesome.  The first time I came in,  didn't know what I wanted and the lady gave me a suggestion and I have never looked back. Food was great,  and spicy to, I love spicy food. Just tell them and they will make it spicy."}
{"text":"We had the chicken and shrimp pad thai and the spicy noodles. This is a small, looks like family owned restaurant. Will definitely be back to try new entrees. Had a hard time deciding what to order, the menu looked great! Prices are very reasonable. I think it was $9 for each entree. Portions are not huge, but pretty good! Order the pad thai medium heat or more for an extra kick."}
{"text":"Good pad Thai and tempura veggies. The spicy items could be spicier but all in all good food especially for the area.  Update...food is now Spicy! Delicious!"}
{"text":"Great food and terrific service. Price was spot on. I would definitely come back.  I had the yellow curry and shared the sampler platter."}
{"text":"Great food! Staff is quick and friendly. Been here multiple times and could recommend to others"}
{"text":"Cute place, polite service, but I do not eat animal products and even though the menu categories said I could order the dishes vegetarian- they still contained Fish Sauce, shrimp paste and oyster sauce... fish and mollusks are not plants, they are living creatures. They assured me that the Pa Nang curry did not contain animal products, so I ordered it trusting them, but I am certain it either had fish sauce or shrimp paste. I have not eaten any animal products in a long time, it tasted good, but that underlying fermented fishy product flavor- it's a slight stink, that's not offensive, but definitely of animal origin- I am nearly positive I detected it, as I would not make a claim like this, unless I really felt certain... If I am wrong, I do apologize, but the word \"vegetarian\" should be removed from items that contain fish, oysters, shrimp, etc.. because, this is not part of a vegetarian diet. And if something contains these items- it would be good to be transparent about it. :("}
{"text":"The last few times I've been here they have really done it right! Sometimes the service can be slow, I caution against going during a lunch hour at work if you're pressed for time. Otherwise, my experiences there lately have been great. Food is delicious and big portions"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem!  Their pineapple curry is one of the best I've had and when I've brought people in are afraid to try Thai - their orange chicken is fantastic but they always taste what I get and want to comeback.  Their service is always fast and friendly and the Decour is surprisingly nice."}
{"text":"Thought the food was really good! Got a to go order and have not dined in. A little unfortunate that there is no alcohol served but will continue to go for dinner and take out!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai place in town. Great food and friendly service! Their Pad Thai and Panang Curry are my two favorites, but out of the several different orders I've had here, they've all been great."}
{"text":"The best Thai food outside Thailand... My fianc√© and I were in Thailand for 1 month last year this time around and wanted to eat the real deal again, after we were disappointed by a Thai place in Tucson 3 weeks ago.  We just were here and had to post right away. At the looks of the pictures what other people had posted we choose to come here. The service was very friendly, it was clean and the food came out fast and was served hot. We took one bite of the fried rice and pad thai and we thought we were back in Thailand. So delicious, big portions and very good price. (of course the Thailand prices would have been even more awesome hahaha) We had eaten Thai around Europe after our trip to Thailand to hunt for the real deal and we found it here in Phoenix.  Will come back for sure. Keep up the good quality!   ps. oh yeah we also had sticky rice with mango to go! great taste(make the portion  of sticky rice a little bigger please :)..)   p.p.s. OK so this happened today!  We went back for lunch! OMG this is already our favorite spot that I bet we will do more then once in a month. Thank you for making amazing food and always being friendly."}
{"text":"Great food. Actually best Panang Curry I've ever had, beats LA Thai Restos I've been to. But I just have them 2stars because of service. The guy is actually friendly but it's just one guy that's working on the floor, doing cash register and serving 2tables, and there's a lot of pickup food as well too. I've been waiting for 20mins just for my check and also a to go box. They need to get more servers seriously. They really have good food. It's just the lack of workers that they need to work on and BTW they suck about tips because they pre-tip 20% on your bill even though they have sucky service."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place.  A friend and I were craving Thai food before we headed to the movies.  I logged on to Yelp and was impressed by the reviews.  I had the green curry and he had the pad thai.  Both were phenomenal!  It wasn't very busy but I wonder if part of it is location and new-ness.  I hope this place really starts picking up LOTS of business as they certainly deserve it  The food was perfect on spiciness if you like spicy.  Very authentic.  Portions are quite large amazing find!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!  I've been several times and tried several things - the food is always fantastic and the service is very kind and considerate!  This is definitely a great Thai place :-)"}
{"text":"We finally got a chance to stop in and try this Thai restaurant.  The place is clean and fairly basic with little Thai flare.  An older women welcomed us.  It was open table selection and we seated ourselves.  Our waitress was friendly and quickly brought us menu's.  We both ordered from the lunch menu ($8) which included soup, egg roll and wanton's.  Service was very good and our meals were delivered quickly.  Both meals were very tasty and spicy for \"medium\" heat.  We plan on going back and trying a few other dishes (a little more spicy for me) in the future."}
{"text":"Food:   - Appetizer combination: 4 pieces of crab rangoons, 4 pieces of cheese wontons, 3 deep fried potstickers, 4 shrimp blanket, and 2 veggie eggrolls.  -- Crab rangoons: hardly had any crab (imitation crab). 3/5 -- Cheese wontons: tasted almost exactly the same as the crab rangoons. 3/5  -- Fried potstickers: filled with pork were yummy. 4/5  -- Shrimp blankets: tasty. 4/5 -- Veggie egg rolls: I'm not huge on veggie eggrolls (I prefer meaty eggrolls) but this one had clear noodles and good flavor. 3/5  - Shrimp and Pineapple Curry: shrimp, pineapple, carrots, and red bell peppers. This has to be one of the best Thai curries I've ever had. This dish exploded with flavor! Yummy spicy, sweet, and coconut-ty red curry flavor! You have to order this! It's sooo good! 5/5  - Pad Thai: noodles, shrimp, chicken, bean sprouts, green onions, carrots, and peanuts. Excellent flavor! Tastes authentic. Chicken and shrimp were both a little dry. They got my requests to put the bean sprouts and green onions on the side correctly (this is always a plus)! 5/5  Service: The waitress was very friendly and polite. She was very attentive and refilled our waters. She stopped by twice to check up on us. We were the only ones there but it was still nice of her. lol. 4/5  Final thoughts: Leftover pad thai was not as good as it was fresh, but the curry was just as good! I wish I had more of it left over. lol. Needless to say, I would definitely come back for more!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Spicy noodles are good, red curry, fried rice (basil and regular) S&S chicken, and lastly, pad Thai -- although a bit sweet the first time, it was very good the next. Lunch specials are a good value as well... As you can tell, I have been there enough times to be considered a fan. I hope you enjoy as much as I do!"}
{"text":"This place is a sweet little find! We had great service, and it was a clean environment (something I always judge). We started with the fresh spring rolls and crab Rangoon, both were delicious. I always have to try Pad Thai on my initial visit to a new Thai restaurant, and this offering did not disappoint. I ordered it medium spicy (mild, medium and hot being the choices) and found the heat level to be just perfect for my tastes! Wish they would not garnish with cilantro though. My husband had a stir fry dish with a name that now escapes me, and he thoroughly enjoyed it as well. My only problem with this place had nothing at all to do with the staff or food. We were unfortunately seated near an obnoxious and very large couple who clearly and loudly argued their way out of a ONE DOLLAR price discrepancy they believed to have found on the menu. Seriously, the guy was a complete jerk. I hate when people like that show up and try to ruin my perfectly good dinner out. Remember folks, always be nice to the people who feed you! In any case, we will definitely be back to Krachai again."}
{"text":"Pa Nang Duck Curry was excellent. 5 on the spicy scale was very spicy but retained the flavor. Will be back to try some of the other dishes!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love, love, love Krachai Thai Kitchen... We first had dinner here one evening and it was soo nice and quiet the day we went.  The food was absolutely delicious...  We recently discovered the lunch specials one day while dining in for lunch... We also love to order and pick up our food on those busy days.... The turnaround time for the food being ready is incredible.  We are thankful they are in the neighborhood and prices are very reasonable.  Every time I try something new, I am never disappointed.  My favorite... Tofu Pad Thai, and Tofu Pad See Ewe..."}
{"text":"Come here sometimes for its authentic Thai cuisine. They are always friendly and the service is fast.  The quality of the food is superb for its price. The portions are not too small and you sometimes get more for what you pay for. Their desserts are fresh except when the mangos are not in season!  I usually go with their Spicy Fried Rice. You can't go wrong with whatever you order. If you have any questions just ask and they will be very accomdating!   J out."}
{"text":"I love this place. I love Thai food and this is some of the best.  The restaurant is clean and nice done. The staff are sooo friendly and because you and tell them exactly how hot you want the dish to be you are in no danger of setting yourself on fire like in so many other Thai restaurants.  You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"The food is SO GOOD! Whenever I get a craving for Thai food, this is the place to go if you are in north Phoenix. I always get takeout and the food is still warm and tasty. It doesn't taste like it has been sitting there for a long time. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"The Pork Pad Thai was very good. There were 8 in our party. Service was prompt, the Food was excellent. Our family will definitely be back."}
{"text":"When I am in the mood for Thai food, I'm happy this place is nearby.  I have tried many different items from the menu and liked them all.  This is quality food with fresh ingredients delivered to your table very fast.  At lunch, we've gotten in and out in 30 minutes.  But the very best part of the restaurant is the family that runs it.  They are nice and accommodating and I enjoy supporting their business."}
{"text":"Decent Thai food. I really like the Larb but I felt like the entrees were somewhat small portions."}
{"text":"Yum!  All 4 of us ordered a different dish so we could try a variety... We were call very pleased!  The green curry was a definite score!"}
{"text":"Food is good. But service is not good. Not very friendly. When we walked in, no greetings, no acknowledgment. Then a hostels/ server saw us and told us to sit wherever we wanted. She brought us a menu and asked us if we wanted water for now. We said yes. She brought two glasses of water for me and my husband. Not for my son. Service is slow. My son and I got food first and my husband waited like 5 min. They didn't come pour more water or asked how food was. We knew it would take forever to get a check, so I walked up to the register and paid there. I want to say this to one server... you seem to be a nice girl but if you work at restaurant, put your hair up. We are not coming back. There are better Thai restaurants with better service in town."}
{"text":"This place is so good.  I love thai food, and am always looking for a good local thai place that knows how to make a quality Tom Kha Gai.  This place knows how to do it.  On top of great soup their peanut sauce and fresh spring rolls are so good.  Actually everything my family ordered was really tasty and we will be back."}
{"text":"If you want authentic Thai cuisine then please go here. I always eat the tom yum soup with chicken and rice on the side. Spice #2 is perfect, and I like spicy food."}
{"text":"This place is legit! I must say it's the best Thai food I've had in a long time. We got the chicken larb. Spicy noodles and pad Thai. Omg the Thai spicy is literally spicy! I'm so happy about that! Definitely coming back again!"}
{"text":"Eat here! This place has friendly service and is delicious. Came with my husband, ordered sampler appetizer and two entrees."}
{"text":"Love this family owned place. Their ingredients are fresh and their food is delicious. One of my favorite Thai places! Try the spicy basil chicken!"}
{"text":"We love this spot! Always a hit, never a miss.   I've only ever gotten food to-go, but the dining room is cute and cozy. The service is phenomenal and the food is delicious.   This time we ordered Tom Yum and Tom Kai soups, both were awesome. We couldn't pick a favorite. The broths were complex, rich, and so comforting.   Plus, the value is great. If you're looking for great, straightforward, no frills thai food, look no further."}
{"text":"Incredibly tasty Thai food. 1st time I ordered the shrimp pad Thai to go for dinner. The noodles were still hot by the time I was able to eat it. 10 mins. The shrimp were huge & perfectly cooked.  I had 2 more meals from the one container.  I couldn't help myself & had ordered the crab rangoon.  So good, I ordered just that a week later after  bringing in friends for their to go orders.  Today I ordered the spicy fried rice with chicken.  Wonderfully delicious & aromatic! Enjoyed every single bite. Reluctantly shared some of it. I cannot wait to order again."}
{"text":"One of the better Thai restaurants in town, convenient location with  a friendly staff. I prefer the spicy level of most of their dishes at a number 3, but they go for my level 1 to a level 5."}
{"text":"We ordered for the first time tonight and it was delicious.  I had the #43 pad thai with medium heat and it was great.  The noodles were just right, it had heat, nuts, complexity, and everything good pad thai should have.  Boyfriend had orange chicken and also loved it; said the mild sauce was just right  Great low prices and plenty of flavor.  We had take out and now the place is on our \"go to\" list. Yum"}
{"text":"Based on my experiences here I cannot recommend this restaurant.   Extremely poor service by a male waiter that definitely did not want to be there.  On our first visit we advised him we had never been there and needed some help with the menu items.     He didn't help much at all.  We ended up ordering the lunch specials,   Soup bland, no flavor.  Eggroll extremely greasy to the point of being not edible.  Red  curry extremely watery, yellow curry very good.   We had to ask for the check.  We went later in the afternoon and they were not busy so this was not the problem.  The yellow curry did have some flavor.  This is the reason for the two stars.  The restaurant is dirty.  The pepper shaker had caked on gunk."}
{"text":"I was hoping this would be a good Thai place based on some of the other reviews, but as someone who has tried most of the Thai restaurants in the Valley, I'm sorry to report that this place is at the bottom of my list of destinations, even when in north Phoenix (better to drive than settle).   Now keep in mind, we have certain items we always order when we eat Thai, and Tom Kha Gai (chicken coconut soup) is one of them. This place doesn't do it well. No galanga, no depth of flavor or complexity, and much, MUCH too sweet. I can't stress this enough. Are they adding sugar, or is it just that they use over-sweetened coconut milk? Not sure. But it's bad. A really big disappointment if you know what good Tom Kha Gai tastes like. They also do not have Angel Wings, which is a staple for one of my family members (they don't even know what they are!).  Other issues / red flags:   - The menu has Vietnamese and Chinese items on it. Do one thing, and do it well... or do fusion I guess. But don't try and specialize in three complex, disparate cuisines. Unless you have a VERY talented, world-traveled chef (or a team of chefs), that never works out well.  - The gentleman who answered the phone when I called with my order does not understand even basic English. For example, he does not know what \"hot\" versus \"mild\" means. This is a big problem as you can imagine.   - If you plan to eat there, beware. The temperature inside the restaurant on a lovely December evening was 80 degrees. You'll be sweating before you get to appetizers.  A few notes to the positive:  - Pricing is low - Panang Curry had a very good flavor"}
{"text":"I love the food here.  To be honest, I have only tried the Shrimp Pineapple Coconut Curry because it's so delicious.  Fresh cut vegetables and fresh pineapple with Thai basil.  I heard the place has been under new ownership for a few months. The food is wonderful and it's cute inside.  The people who run the place are very sweet and friendly."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! It did take about 45 minutes to get both our appetizer and main courses. There were only two of us in our party so this seemed a little long. I noticed they have a lot of to go orders so it was probably due to that. Nonetheless, one of the best Thai spots around!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for a couple years and love their food, there is nothing I haven't liked! They also have great friendly service. They are reasonably priced with huge portions."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch and had the Phad Prik Khing dish with chicken and it was excellent. I had never had Prik Khing curry before, but I will definitely be back for more! The portion size was good. The meal came with soup, vegetable  roll and fried wonton. The place was very clean. We were the first people in the place so service was good."}
{"text":"Krachai Thai restaurant is so delicious!  The food they serve is very consistent and the lunch specials are a great deal.  What an amazing hole in the wall."}
{"text":"Ordered the Thai Tea, Pad thai, Fried rice, and papaya salad.  Everything is good. Most Thai restaurant fries rice are soggy. Doesn't look fried. This place has excellent service."}
{"text":"Not bad for thai food in Phoenix. granted I only ate 2 items so far, the Papaya salad and Phad Thai. will try for more items there."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good food.    My wife and I got their Pad-see-ew, Pa-Nang curry with beef, and finished with their Sweet rice with Thai Mango.    Everything was really good.  Excellent flavor combination.  The Pad-see-ew had the perfect amount of heat on them (spicy and temperature).  The needles had a nice thin char to them which was perfect - the dish was cooked perfectly.    The Pa-Nang curry was also very flavorful and my wife (generally does not like spicy food) thought that it was very good.  Their sweet rice with Mango was perfect to end the course.  If you have never tried that dish.  I suggest that you try it at least once.  Granted - the mango has to be in season for it to be good (thus seasonal)    We will definitely be coming back.  This restaurant is probably our favorite Thai in the area.  We'll give the other restaurants a try before we come back just to be fair.  However, we have a feeling that we'll be back real soon."}
{"text":"This place is so wonderful I could cry. I have not found a great place for Thai on the west side that's close to home and this place is fantastic! Tell your friends and your family because this place is a gem!"}
{"text":"If you're craving Thai food and you happen to be in the Phoenix area, this is a wonderful place to go! Our waiter was very sweet and the food was delicious. Very flavorful blend of spices and it's nice that you can choose how spicy you want your food. I absolutely loved the spicy eggplant with chicken and definitely recommend the dish and the restaurant."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Thai places I've eaten at and is always consistent."}
{"text":"I am saddened by the demise of this restaurant.  We walked in and had to \"yoo hoo\" to get server/hostess attention. The restaurant was pitifully empty on a Saturday night at 7:30. We ordered our usual chicken satay appetizer which was not \"as good as usual\", meat was on the dry side and the peanut sauce was lumpy. As wew waited for our food, I saw a bug on the floor which i had to deal with under the weight of my flip flop. It was then that i noticed how utterly filthy the floor was.  My husband agreed, the place had undeniably succumbed to a fate several ethnic restaurants at this very location have suffered.  We pondered what else could be unwashed beside the floors and what else could possibly be creepy crawlin around the kitchen. I left with the heebie jeebies and we both agreed we would not venture back. So very sad :("}
{"text":"We ordered or dishes to go. We ordered shrimp egg rolls, spicy noodle with beef and spicy fried rice with beef. The service was prompt and courteous and prices comparable to what I see back in San Diego.  The flavor was on point. The reduction in stars is for the lack of meat in our dishes."}
{"text":"I've now been a regular here for almost two years. For awhile I went weekly because their food was that good, but it's slipping, as is the service.  Things that used to perfectly cooked are now regularly underdone - think nearly raw broccoli and carrots. The regular servers were the owners adult children, and now it's usually a guy who doesn't speak enough English to take a food order, so the food almost always comes out wrong. I've tried to avoid this twice now by placing to-go orders before the son leaves, and in both instances the food was very wrong.   It's worth a try, especially the yellow curry (which is on the sweet side), so long as you can be patient. The Pad Thai is still not as good as Yupha's."}
{"text":"I loved my food it was very good but my friends food was seasoned way too hot for their taste. I'd go back but I think the others wouldn't. Also, they ran out of a lot of items so the menu had limitations."}
{"text":"Best red curry I've had in a long time!! Seriously I am salivating just thinking of it. And if you ask for it extra spicy, oh boy will they make it hot! I love going in for their lunch special. For $7.50 you get soup, 2 wontons, an egg roll, and an entree with rice. Good prices, good service, and excellent red curry. Their orange chicken is also very good, but I can never bring myself to order anything besides the red curry because it is so freakin' good. My one complaint is they serve sweet and sour as the dipping sauce for the egg rolls when I prefer the sweet chili sauce many Thai places serve instead."}
{"text":"It was OK.  Not terrible.  Not great.  But that's just my opinion.  The group in the large table next to me were repeat customers and they loved it all.  The restaurant interior is very pleasant and tasteful and clean.  The servers were nice but I had to return my drink because it was diet not regular.  I also heard the older woman yelling at one of the girls for throwing something out...that bothered me...if the girl thought it was supposed to be thrown out, it probably should have been.  I had the shrimp Pad Tai and the shrimp was overcooked and the Pad Tai while OK didn't have vegetables as I was used to.  Again...it's all my preferences.  Try it for yourself because I always want local businesses to succeed."}
{"text":"I am so upset and so are my co workers today. We just came back from lunch at krachai. The service was so bad. The soup and roll they give out today soup had egg, we all asked if we remove soup and replace it with 1 more veggie roll. Lady did not understand another lady came she tried to understand and replied in a very condescending manner that 'this soup and roll is something we just GIVE to you guys' so basically it was a free food and favor for us so we better not ask or make any request related to that. This is a family business, kitchen is quite open. We could hear them all arguing and yelling at each other about soup and extra veggie roll.  We were quite upset by now, then food came and we ate by the time 3 people paid the lady asked me that since this is a group of 7 everyone must add certain amount to their bill as gratuity. There was some argument and we all started adding to our bills. The kind of service we got nobody wanted to tip at all. She was so pissed the way she was talking to us throughout our meal but now she wants forced TIP. She was literally humiliating all of us. Whatever your family problem keep t to yourself and watch your attitude. This restaurant sits in a dead strip mall. You just lost our business. This is not just 7 people these are 7 different families and 7 people who will tell their co workers about you and good luck with that, that is all I can say."}
{"text":"The food is really good! It's definitely better than a lot of the Thai restaurants I've been to lately. What they lost the 2 stars on is customer service and being cheap. By cheap, I don't mean prices. They gave us each a tiny bowl of rice...and charged us for more. I've never had any other places charge for more rice. Now onto service; we were the only ones in there and after we ran out of rice, we waited about a solid 20 minutes for anyone to ask if everything was ok and if  we needed anything else.   Other than that, the food is delish!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! They're red curry is amazing! Their orange chicken and pad thai are also great! My friends loved the fried rice they got. This is the place to go for thai!"}
{"text":"Came at lunch on a weekday. Very clean and quiet. Ordered spicy noodles from the lunch special and an iced coffee. Also got the coconut ice cream because I'm a pig.   Waitress was attentive but not intrusive. I was at lunch by myself and was catching up on a few episodes of a tv show on my phone. She took care of whatever I asked for and when ever I looked up, my water glass was full and my dirty dishes whisked away.  This place is off the chain. Perfect iced coffee, possibly the best drunken noodles/spicy noodles I've ever had and a pleasant ambience. Coconut ice cream was a very generous serving and really delicious. I will be back."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in town! The Spicy Noodles and Spicy Thai Basil alone make it worth trying out. They have generous portions and our take-out orders are always ready when we get there."}
{"text":"I love Thai food and this place is amazing! It was my first time here the place was very clean and the staff was very friendly and attentive. The Thai tea was delicious and priced appropriately. I ordered the tom yum shrimp hot pot and it was great! Definitely plan on coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Nice environment,  excellent friendly service and the food was wonderful.  Hot and flavorful and large portion. I ordered the chicken noodles and asked them to substitute carrots for the bamboo shoots. U can order ur food as spicy as u like. Good value for the money!  Definately would go back if I lived here :)"}
{"text":"Karachai is an authentic, family-owned Thai restaurant in a strip mall with plenty of parking.  Clean, bright, airy restaurant with lots of windows and very good service.  Entrees are served with a bowl of rice and you will definitely need it if you get anything above a level 2 in spiciness.  Spiciness ranges from low of 1 to a high of 5.  We were happy with 1s and 2s as anything above was too spicy for us.  We had Pad Thai Noodles, Green Curry with Chicken, Kra Prow with Minced Chicken (normally served with sliced chicken but we asked and they accommodated our minced chicken request), and Tofu with Eggplant.  All of the dishes were excellent with good flavor and texture contrasts.  If you are a newbie to Thai food, the four dishes have different flavors and sauces for a good walk-through to Thai cuisine.  We closed with Sticky Rice with Fried Banana Rolls with Coconut Ice Cream which had two scoops of ice cream, and two egg roll wrapped fried banana pieces.  The crunch of the egg roll skin went well with the chewier sticky rice and smooth ice cream.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"The first thing I noticed about this place was the simple but comfortable seating.  No stiff chairs or cramped spaces here.  The second thing I noticed was that my waitress was the tallest Thai woman I have ever seen - she must be considered a giant in Thailand.  The third thing I noticed was the FOOD IS GREAT.  Excellent freshness, herbs, and spices.  I got the pineapple-shrimp curry ($12)  and a Thai iced tea ($2.50).  I ate until it hurt.  I ordered mild, but I should have ordered cold because it was still a bit too spicy for my delicate taste buds.  The last thing I noticed was that the price is the same as other places that serve lower-quality food.  I wanted to try one of their awesome-sounding desserts, but I couldn't because my stomach was completely full."}
{"text":"What an amazing Thai place! The staff was friendly both on the phone and in person. Service was quick! The cleanliness of the restaurant was supberb. My dad, husband, and I each had different curries and they were all perfectly savory. Portions are decently sized.  We've tried several different Thai restaurants in the area. This is by far our favorite and the others can't even compete. We really hope Krachai is able to gain a good clientele."}
{"text":"I have to give the attention that Krachai Thai deserves.  First things first, I feel that of all places that I or my family dine at will be sucessible to a fair review.  Im not overly critical, however...if there is room for improvement the ratings would obviously reflect that.  Eating Asian food is all that i've been accustomed to; especially that of South east Asian food such as Cambodian, Vietnamese and Thai food.    Every Friday, my wife and I alternate our picks for where to eat at the end of a long working weekday.  The rule of course....is that once its your pick, the other cannot moan and groan as they will have their revenge the following Friday.  If its a pick that you happen to like or love and the significant other picked it out....double whammy win.  Well....I like to explore different picks and not the same ol same ol....I came across Krachai Thai in hot new places on yelp.  I read the few reviews and they seemed very positive and I decided to investigate my potential pick for the week.  Looking at their professionally laid out menu on their webpage, the pictures looked inviting and I was salivating by the end.  Prices were great for Thai and very affordable.  But was the food going to be as great as described or on the pictures or compared to other Thai haunts that my family frequented?  Time for a visit.  We didnt live that close as we are mostly South West valley, however, I felt the slight trek to Karchai was going to be worth it.  I was not dissapointed.  From the moment we walked in...we were greeted with nice decour, friendly service and more than reasonable prices on the menu....we ordered what we normally order for Tom kai coconut broth and chicken soup with rice....absolutely delicious.  They did such a wonderfjl job with this.  Both my young daughters opted to share on a kids menu the orange chicken with rice that had some salad and an eggroll...they loved it.  we also ordered the mussaman curry with beef...wow! Bill was less than $30...wth?!?  service was absolutely perfect and they got a fat tip as a result.  Seriously...where did these guys come from....wonderful!"}
{"text":"Best Thai in town. It's a family owned restaurant in a dive of an area. Take the chance and give it a try."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and was so happy we stopped by. Great prices and delicious!!! Spicy Thai Rice, amazing. Pad Thai also delicious. So glad they're around the corner from my house. I will be going back!!"}
{"text":"I am Thai food lover.I had lived in Bangkok for several years. I had so manyThai food there.Today I was in the area. Saw a sign from street said Thai food. Hell yeah got to check this place out went in there . Ordered beef pad Thai .I had it thai hot level . That's what I like .1st time there not sure how it was goin to be. Took a chance. Man Turn out this place really know how to cook real pad Thai .Service was really friendly.I would definitely go back there again if I am in that area."}
{"text":"It was a take out kinda day and Thai is good comfort food what can I say. A friend recommended this place and it's not far from work so stopped there on my way home today for dinner.  I had the stir fried eggplant with chicken which I saw on another review and boy was it delish! The chicken and eggplant really complimented each other and the sauce was tasty. I also got some chicken panang and although it was a bit watery in my opinion, it was quite flavorful, I just added extra rice to soak up some of the sauce. The larb was probably some of the best larb I have tasted. They didn't ask, and I forgot to mention, the spice level so everything came sans heat. Next time, and there will def be a next time, I will make sure to inquire about a spice level, maybe start with a 3 to be safe."}
{"text":"At least my third lunch here.  Spicy basil chicken is prepared my favorite way, with lots of veggies.  Brown rice is a free option.  Salad dressing is spicy peanut Thai,, but the soup is the best around for Thai lunch special.  I love that they offer pad see yew (broccoli noodle). Service is friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"This Lil place is amazingly good. I ordered the beef noodles and my god it was great. And it was only $8.95. WOW!!  I will totally come again."}
{"text":"We don't live close to this restaurant, but we have been at least 5 times to dine in, and have ordered take out several more times, since discovering it not long ago. I wasn't a red curry fan until tasting theirs. Now I won't order anything else. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times, both dine in and take out. My wife and I love Thai food and have eaten at many restaurants in Asia and the US. For taste and value this is top pick for Phoenix."}
{"text":"Their beef salad is amazing. Love the curries and papaya salad as well. Everything is made with love and very authentic Thai food."}
{"text":"Delicious! I ordered the red chicken curry lunch special (hot) and boy was it spicy! I rarely am even phased by a Thai restaurant's \"hot\" curry but this takes the cake! There was so much delicious chicken in the curry too! And loads of veggies! The lunch special is a great value since it comes with wontons, an egg roll AND soup! The food was waiting for me when I got in and the takeout hostess was super friendly. I can't wait to try their whole menu!"}
{"text":"I love thai food and have been eating it for a while. I just moved from California and I used to go to thai town to eat at thai restaurants so I can say this place isn't too traditional on their cooking from experience. Their soups are way off on flavor as well as other dishes. I will not say it's bad, it's good. But traditional thai dishes are amazing. If you come here I will recommend there thai tea it's great and their beef on a stick, that dish is traditional and great."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars  While at work, if I ever go out to eat, I usually stick with the same things over and over.  I like what I like...what can I say?  Today I wanted something a little bit different though and I decided to scope out some Asian places on Yelp.  I decided to come on down here and try this restaurant out.  It had a couple of things going for it that had me intrigued. It was only about a 5 minute drive from work, the pictures of the food looked good, plus I had only had Thai food once or twice before and wanted to sample some, stat!  I placed my order over the phone for an order of  Spicy Noodles with Beef and an order of Egg Rolls.  I drove down, walked in, paid the lady my money and was on my way.  Here is how everything was..............  Egg Rolls- $2.95 for 3.  These were small egg rolls with a vegetable filling.  Eh...they were just ok.  They were crunchy at first when you bit in, but then it was tough to fully chomp through a piece cleanly.  I had to bite in and then kind of tear off a piece because they were a bit chewy.  They weren't horrible, but I would not get them again.  The sauce they serve them with was good at least!  Spicy Noodles with Beef-  When I placed my order, the lady asked how spicy I wanted it within a scale of 1-5.  I went with a level 3 which I thought would be decently hot/spicy.  I opened the lid of the container and was impressed with what I saw.  It was a decent sized mound of noodles, bell peppers, onions, fried egg pieces and some beef.  The beef reminded me of a Korean bulgogi kind of.  It was really thin, seasoned well (soy sauce, I think) and tender.  The noodles were plentiful and had a great texture to them.  They were kind of hard to eat with a plastic fork though.  The veggies were tasty.  The only bad thing about this dish was there was a bed of lettuce on the bottom of all the good stuff.  This lettuce wilted up and turned into a cabbage almost.  I picked all of that out and set it aside.  Flavor of the whole dish was good.  It was not too spicy...I would order a level 4 or 5 spiciness when I come back.  Overall, it was good!  It was a break from the norm and I did enjoy my lunch.  Next time here, I'll get a little spicier noodles and I should be good to go.  Service was friendly and my order was ready right when I told them I would pick it up!  I appreciated the promptness!"}
{"text":"4 Stars overall, 5 Stars for the area  Great food at a good price. I've had stir fries (phad kaprow, phad prik sod), green curry, and pad thai. My husband likes the pineapple fried rice. All have been good and satisfying. This is my go-to place in the Glendale, AZ area.  Spicy noodles = drunken noodles"}
{"text":"This is the best Thai restaurant I've ever eaten at. The fried rice is to die for!"}
{"text":"The pad Thai is really good. They use real lime not the fake juice. The Tom yum is also great with the fire at table to create a great meal."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai food in town. In a world with Thai restaurants closing their doors all the time, this hidden gem shines bright. Everything is fantastic, down to the perfectly cooked broccoli. I highly suggest trying this west side spot. We need to do all we can to support this local business."}
{"text":"Best crab Rangoon I've ever had!  It actually has real crab!!  The dipping sauce is perfection!"}
{"text":"Just another mediocre Thai restaurant in the valley. We ordered the spicy noodles and tom yum soup. The soup was a little bland, which it surprising considering how many ingredients go in it! The mushrooms were added into the soup whole and were practically raw which made them pretty unappetizing to eat. The Spicy noodles was basically like a spicy pad see ew. They were alright but were laid out on a plate of iceberg lettuce. It was probably meant as a garnish but who wants to eat wilted warm lettuce with their noodles? Ordered a thai tea and it tasted like it was either watered down or bottled. Overall we left full but unimpressed. Our search for good Thai food in the valley continues!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've ever had. We ordered the chicken pad thai, the pri khing, and the crab noodles. Everything was delicious and VERY flavorful. If you like spicy, order a two and you can always make it more spicy... when they say their 3 is spicy, they mean it!  The chicken satay was excellent as well. The family that owns Krachai has a lot of pride in their food and takes their time preparing carefully. They were so kind, and that made the experience even better!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place because I love Thai food. I ordered the fresh shrimp spring rolls and I bit down on a piece of glass.  Ruined my appetite. I didnt even bother trying the pad thai I ordered. Wont be going back thats for sure"}
{"text":"The place smells delicious, staff are very friendly and the food is amazing so far the best Thai place I've been in Phoenix so far. I don't know which is my favorite but I will definitely be back to try the Pad Thai!"}
{"text":"Excellent, tasty and fresh Thai Food. Service isn't the fastest but not too long either. Great place for going out with friends. One of my favorites on this side of town!"}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food. Service is super fast. I ordered the red curry from lunch specials menu and it was sooo good!! I would definitely recommend this place with a five star rating :)"}
{"text":"Was in the mood for some thai food so I used yelp to help me find this place. First time being here and first impression was that the place was clean, and the staff was real friendly and easy to talk to while placing my order. After reviewing the menu I settled on pad see ewe with level 5 on the spicy scale with a side order of pot stickers to go. Arrived at home and broke open the take out containers and was smacked in the face with such a lovely smell and couldn't wait to dig in. Food tasted really fresh and tasty,  and the pot stickers were on point. My only one complaint is that the level 5 could use to be a bit more spicy.. other than that I will definately return and tell friends about this place."}
{"text":"Had been wanting to try this place for some time and so glad we did... absolutely delicious! We had the rama and satay as an appetizer; the chicken was outstanding! Can't believe this is in my neighborhood and I'm only now finding out how amazing the food is. Friendly service and everything was fresh, down to the lemon in our water. I will definitely be back...soon!"}
{"text":"This was such a gam to have found! I loved the food and service was fast. It wasn't busy either and portion size was big enough"}
{"text":"My mothers friend was the previous owner of this restaurant, now it's under new management and has a new owner. In my opinion it was better than it is now but it's still a good restaurant. I absolutely love Thai food. The appitizers are still delicious.  Especially the shrimp blankets and crab Rangoon. I recommend the beef noodle soup and it really good when i ordered it. I also had the fried rice and sweet and sour chicken, which was also very good. I would  recommend this place to a friend."}
{"text":"Really, really good food. Red Curry spicy level 4 if you crave heat. Only with they would partner with Uber eats. Small family owned."}
{"text":"Good food. Friendly staff. I'm in town on business and it was some tasty food despite they ran out of calamari"}
