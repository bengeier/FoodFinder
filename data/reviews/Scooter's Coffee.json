{"text":"Love, love Scooter's coffee! I haven't been to Starbucks or Dutch Bros since Scooter's opened. I especially love the Blended Caramelicious! The Scooter's App is super easy to use. I purchased 1 Scooter's gift card and have been reloading it since then."}
{"text":"Nasty and expensive !!!!! Coffee was horrible circle k has better coffee and that's probably some of the worst coffee !!! The bagel was rock hard !!! Never going back thanks I'll stick to Coffee bean Starbucks Dutch brothers even McDonald's has better food and coffee"}
{"text":"Wow  Great place....best coffee around. Service  is always the best   Was a daily Starbuck user....no more"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try something other than Starbucks. I ordered an iced coffee and one of their most popular drinks an iced caramelicous. First off, there's only 1 shot in their medium.. so I added a shot. Both drinks tasted more like a watered down coffee with some syrup added. I spent almost $10 on two drinks and was so disappointed! I wouldn't go back or recommend them to anyone."}
{"text":"I moved to Phoenix from Nebraska and have missed Scooter's so much! So glad to see one in Arizona now. I got the peppermint mocha latte and it was great! Overall great experience! Not disappointed at all."}
{"text":"I usually go to Starbucks.. this was allot faster, I have tried the latte and the Americano and both have been awesome and I definitely recommend their cinnamon roll very delicious!"}
{"text":"Love trying new coffee spots; this is the only Scooter's I've ever been to. It's comparable in flavor to Dutch bros and better than Starbucks in my opinion. I've definitely driven out of my way for a coffee fix at Scooter's!"}
{"text":"Wasn't blown away like I thought I'd be.  The service was great but the coffee was not what i was expecting considering the hype."}
{"text":"Disappointed!! Drove by this drive thru coffee shop and was excited to see one so close to my job. Headed there before work now I wish I hadn't.   Had a breakfast burrito the size of a credit card. It was cold and the eggs were gritty. They seemed to be microwaved. The salsa was just tomato sauce with onions.   The muffins were mushy and tasted like batter. And the coffee was weak. I won't be back again; lacked quality and was too expensive for the taste."}
{"text":"So much better than dutch bros and Starbucks coffee. Great employees, great drinks! Love getting iced coffees, desert pear lemonades, and any iced latte! Favorite coffee spot!"}
{"text":"good coffee with great service. They offered me a punch card and I usually go in the mornings but they are quick and it's delicious every time"}
{"text":"Total let down. I was looking for a Starbucks and saw Scooter's on my way. I asked if they had cold brew and was told that all iced coffee was cold brewed... there is no way. 3 dollars and change for a medium watered down mess. It tastes like when you're done with an iced coffee, forget about it in your car, find it hours later,  take a sip hoping it tastes decent, and it's just coffee flavored water- with the exception being you get a full cup of it. There's no doubt they piled ice into a cup poured hot coffee on it and called it a day."}
{"text":"Usually get a turtle blender and cinnamon bun. Pretty quick, and the drinks are great blend of the sweet and bitter coffee.   The staff is always friendly.  Started going here since dutch bros was too far. Plus dutch bros doesn't know how to make a proper turtle frappe.  Been coming here for 9 months, don't plan on stopping."}
{"text":"Love this place. The coffee is delicious and the prices are comparable to Starbucks and Dutch Bros. The blended drinks are to die for. I'm so happy the opened in the area.  The app is simple. It works like the Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts app. You just buy a gift card and load it in. You get a punch for every $5. Obtain 12 \"punches\" to get a free drink. Not the best deal out there, but it's not like they have to do anything like that."}
{"text":"This place is so disappointing. They claim to have the best iced coffee and let me tell you, its far from \"the best.\" First of all their large iced coffee is 3.55, which seems reasonable, except the large is the size of a Starbucks medium (grande) or Dutch bros small. That's a little crazy. Now, let's get to the actual taste. When I'm told the iced coffee is cold brew, I'm expecting a stronger coffee, something that actually tastes like coffee, not bitter, just strong. This was like a light roast coffee. I have had store bought bottled coffee that's better. It tasted watered down and more like a black tea than a coffee. We also got a tea which was again mediocre. It didn't have the crisp taste of a fresh tea. It tasted stale, like the coffee. I don't typically recommend Starbucks, but you're much better off going their for your caffeine needs. Skip scooters."}
{"text":"I'm from the Midwest and was overjoyed when I found out a Scooter's is just 8 min away from me! The vertigo smoothies are amazing! As is their coffee and cinnamon rolls! Love this place!"}
{"text":"More than $5.00 for an iced coffee is way to much. It's only $3.50 at Starbucks. Also they haven't found the perfect brew. The coffee was so bitter I couldn't even drink it. I seen a recent post where his was very clear."}
{"text":"Place closes at 5pm when most people need that evening pick me up. Their Info online says open till 6pm. Coffee is good but pricey and I would enjoy it more but it's never open within the time I need it. Post hours on your drive thru menu so people aren't sitting there waiting thinking you're open."}
