{"text":"Family decided to try more new restaurants for 2014 and Bindia was a great find. Wife and I enjoyed the heat and flavours of the butter chicken and vindaloo. My 7 year old enjoyed the tandoori, mango lassi and khulfi. Highly recommend for dinner. Went back later for lunch and had the lamb wrap - awesome. Can't wait for summer and the windows to open for the atmosphere from the Market."}
{"text":"Brought most of my indian relatives here. All were very happy with the quality of food and exceptional service.  
Very happy to have an indian restaurant of this caliber in the area."}
{"text":"Had the butter chicken, chicken korma, naan bread, and veggie pakora. 

Everything  tasted good. Only thing i would say is I've had better pakora."}
{"text":"The food was super yummy. Went for lunch and their lunch specials were so big that we took them home and had the leftovers for dinner. The staff are very friendly and went the extra mile for us. We were traveling from the US and asked about an attraction in Toronto. They told us all about it and plulled up the website for us on a tablet so we could check it out! This place is awesome!"}
{"text":"Excellent Indian, and friendly fantastic service and atmosphere.   Expensive, but of the highest quality and standard.   Lamb Vindaloo and Chicken Tikki Masala both were fantastic.  Naan and vegetable samosas also great.   Dining here from our of town we were pleasantly surprised after stopping in on a whim."}
{"text":"Found an elastic band in my biryani!! We've been ordering shrimp biryani from you for the last 2 years coz we love it so much. But today, after a tiring day at work, we were so looking forward to jus getting into our pjs and having home cooked food (yes, thats how much we love the food) and only to find a piece of disaster in my meal! We are so disappointed and now skeptical whether to order in future or not. Its so easy for us to order from other indian restaurants like jaipur grill, aroma etc but your food was closest to home. Having second thoughts!"}
{"text":"Located in the vibrant St. Lawrence Market area, my wife and I enjoyed a lovely dinner here yesterday evening, and would recommend this establishment for its tasty dishes, served by friendly and attentive staff. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The service and cost for what you get is subpar. The person helping us which I presume was the owner or manager was terrible when dealing with us.  We will not be going back again."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food and the step away from simple tradition with a few extra masalas and a bunch of creative dishes. Naturally the bindi was delish. The lamb was really good and worth a return visit."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all with the food. Delivery however, was very quick and the delivery guy turned out to be the owner who was very nice. Ordered Chicken Biryani and Malai Tikka and it wasn't close to what it should be. The Chicken biryani has peas in it...really? Peas is not something that goes in authentic Chicken Biryani..it's OK for home food. Biryani is all about the spices and is an art to cook it to the right consistency. I don't expect to listen to 'But everyone makes Biryani differently'..nope!, because then it's not Biryani. The one we ordered was more of Chicken pulao with alot of chilly powder and I don't think customers should be your test field. The malai tikka had no malai on it....except that it was cooked very well and was more like soft pieces of Chicken with extremely mild seasoning of some sort. I had Malai tikka that has alot of Malai on it and it goes very well with Naan.

As a startup, I hope they take negative criticism constructively and improve. Will order from them in a year to see if things have changed."}
{"text":"This place is a great addition to the neighbourhood!!  My friends and I have been waiting for more restaurants (that don't double as a pub) to come to the area for awhile.  When we went to the restaurant we were greeted by the very friendly owner and his wife.  Service was fantastic and the food was very flavourful, and I've had plenty of bad Indian food in the city.  Granted it's somewhat on the expensive side, however the quality of the food and the open and fresh ambience is worth a nice night out.  

We had the lamb vindaloo, the garlic nana, the butter chicken and the spinach (saag?)

I don't normally enjoy butter chicken but this was didn't taste like it came from a package crammed with sugar.  It was very nice.

The lamb vindaloo had the perfect amount of spice and reminded me of other similar dishes I've had in Southeast Asia - delicious!  The spinach dish was a nice offset to this.

Definitely have the garlic naan."}
{"text":"We've always had very friendly service. Nice atmoshpere. Food is always good no matter what you try. Love their Baingan Bharta, Pakoras, Tandoori Aloo and Chicken Tika Masala. Their mango lassi is the best I've had. I highly recommend you give it a try if you like Indian food. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I was disappointed as I had high hopes for this new addition to the neighbourhood.
The food is ok, but it is expensive for what you get. The portions are small compared to other Indian restaurants I've tried. The space is cold and bright. It's not a comfortable place to dine. The wait staff seemed inexperienced - I had to ask for menus.  They'll need to make some changes if they are to survive."}
{"text":"Delicious ingredients right from the St Lawrence Market next door - can't get much fresher than that.  Besides freshness, a great atmosphere and a personable chef, the top selling factor here is the variety in taste that each dish offers.  Many times, a tikka dish will have similar sauce to a curry or butter chicken - but at Bindia, each dish burst with its own flavor.  YUMMO."}
{"text":"By far, one of the best indian foods I have ever had! 
I have, so far, tried the Butter Chicken, Mint Tikka Chicken and shrimp tandoori, and I must say that they all exceeded my expectations.
Pricing may seem a bit steep, but for the quality of food, ingredients, and service I would not expect the prices to be any cheaper."}
{"text":"I went into Bindia as a substitute for next door's Market Catch being closed.  I was pleasantly surprised when I walked in the door: While being immediately greeted by the host, I noticed the restaurant had very modern decor with fine lines (a favorite style of mine).  

Since I wasn't starving, I decided to order only a main.  I opted for the butter chicken (medium spicy) and a side of basmati rice.  As I'm from the US, it is strange to me to have to pay an additional charge for rice.  Regardless, my food came out promptly, hot and fresh.  Normally, there are 3-4 chunks of meat in standard Indian dishes, but my butter chicken was overflowing.  The chicken was cooked perfectly while the sauce was rich but not overwhelming.  The only \"complaint\" (if there could be one) was that medium spicy was underpowered.  Perhaps the Canadian spiciness scale is lower than the US's, but next time I'm going to order my dish spicier.  

Overall, I give Bindia 4.5 stars (unfortunately, Yelp only allows for 4).  The decor, service, and food quality were all very good.  I definitely recommend checking this place out if you are in the mood for Indian food - it's a great value for your money."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time last night and it was delightful!  First of all the restaurant is aesthetically pleasing very modern but cozy at the same time. Large windows looking at the StLawrence Market - which was pretty with the snow.  The service was also wonderful the serving staff was very attentive but not overbearing. The food was really good we ordered the garlic naan, basmati rice, chili chicken and butter chicken. The servings were plentiful and very flavorful. However, I like my food nice and spicy and when I ordered medium on the chilli chicken I was expecting a bit more of a kick so I will go with hot next time."}
{"text":"Relative to other Indian restaurants, this is really $$$ but given the quality of the food, well worth it. The restaurant is nice, the service is great and the food was amazing. The portions are a bit smaller but this isn't an all you can eat joint and they are more than big enough for a normal dinner portion. If you're very hungry you'll have to get a starter as well."}
{"text":"Wife and I were hungry and hit upon Bindia right on their 5pm opening Saturday afternoon. Both waitresses were very knowledgeable and efficient. 

The food was spectacular. The kitchen knows authentic Indian.  Don't be deceived by the seemingly small portions. With either the naan or rice (we had one of each) as a side, we couldn't finish and were happy to take home leftovers.  

Every dish on this menu works. Well done, we would recommend this restaurant  to all."}
{"text":"Best indian food in Toronto. Fresh ingredients, table side greetings from the chef, and a beautiful setting. The chef's passion and dedication to his craft is evident by the taste and presentation of amazing plates. A must visit!"}
{"text":"4.5/5! Loved the mint chicken tikka, sev puri, Kebobs, paneer tikka and stuffed naan! Fantastic service and authentic food. Highly recommend :)"}
{"text":"AMAZING experience trying Bindia for the 2nd time and this experience was definitely memorable and worth sharing. The lamb curry was spicy, rich and full of flavour. The naan was light and not over done. The lamb biryani was excellent, not too rich but the right balance of flavour. There's an undertone of ginger and cardamom that leaves a fresh, pleasant taste in my mouth. I can't wait to eat here again!"}
{"text":"Visited with my parents recently and ordered 3 dishes.  Mint Tikka Chicken, Bhindi Masala and Dal Makni.  We also tried the Gajerla and Kulfi for desert. 

Mom said the Tikka was good but not phenomenal and my father and I felt the same way about the dishes we ordered. The food is flavorful but I can't agree with other yelp reviews proclaiming this to be one of the best Indian restaurants in the city. 

Our meal came to $100 before tip and no alcohol was ordered. Pretty steep. The food was good, but not spectacular or amazing. There are restaurants in the city that are so good that you don't care what the prices are because the food is soo tasty. This place isn't there yet. If the price point was more reasonable I'd give it 4 stars but I'll still visit again someday."}
{"text":"Start with the positive, amazing fresh naan. I tried to call in a lunch order for take-out but no one answered the phone so I figure the place must be either closed or extremely busy. I walked over anyways to see and it was neither closed, nor busy but there was only one poor woman trying to serve 3 tables, work the host stand and take my take out order. I ordered the butter chicken with naan which only took about 10 minutes and was hot and fresh tasting when I got it back to my desk. The portion is really small for the 10$ price. Lots of bread but the chicken came in a small soup container about 3/4 full with mostly sauce and 5 small morcels of chicken. The sauce was decent though. I'm not totally disappointed but I won't be back."}
{"text":"We went to this place 3 times now, the first we dine in and ordered a lot amount of food because we wanted to try everything and other two evening we order take out because we live just across the street and wanted something quick for dinner (lentil soup for cold winter evenings) after work.

The decor is really nice and the staff is friendly and helpful, our waiter -sorry I don't remember the name- helped us going through the menu and adviced us on which meal we could like based on our conversation.

The portion are just about the right size for each person but you can split a bit of it with your other loved one just for a quick \"try bite\"!

The food is Indian but not Indian from little India kinda of meal is more westernized Indian so there are no problems if you think you might not like some of their dishes or ingredients, everything they serve is pretty much tasty and you won't find weird tastes here so even the most sophisticated person can go blind here and I'm probably sure you won't find anything that you won't like.

The price is about right too, and to be in this area is certainly not bad, since it's the best area in downtown and everything it's so pretty around here.

I encourage you to try it, it does not disappoint."}
{"text":"Great food at reasonable prices! We ordered the butter chicken, chicken tikka, garlic naan, regular naan, and the stuffed naan. Everything was fresh and well flavored. The chicken tikka could've used a bit more spice but I think you can ask them to make it spicier. We were eating the butter chicken sauce for a couple of days afterwards with whatever food we had a home, it was delicious. For well portioned, clean, and tastey Indian food, I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"The server was really friendly and attentive. Try the bhuna lamb. Its delicious!   The decor is warm and welcoming."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today. The combination of food and service was fantastic and, honestly, in my experience, that's rare for Toronto. The food is flavourful and not drenched in oil and salt. If you like spicy Indian dishes I would advise asking for \"Extra spicy\" as I think their bar for spicy is more geared towards a tamer palate. We ordered the okra and it took a little longer so the chef came out and personally explained the cause for the delay (okra is cut and cleaned fresh for each order... Effectively cooking it from scratch which takes more time of course). It was a nice touch. The waitress was very amicable and organized. The service was a big part of our positive experience. Ambiance is great. The food is a bit pricey and usually Indian food is on the lower price point but this prices were justified in my opinion. Great place and I wish them a prosperous future in St Lawrence market."}
{"text":"Just ordered take out from Bindia Indian Bistro and it was delicious!  The food arrived in a timely manner and was very hot on arrival.  Ive read that people felt portion sizes were typically small, but I did not feel that to be the case with the take out portions.  Ive eaten at a lot of indian restaurants and felt that the portions were comparable.  We ordered the Garlic Naan, Basmati Rice the Lamb Vindaloo, which was amazing the lamb was very tender,  Butter Chicken and Dal Makhni all very very good.  I'd have to say this is probably the best Indian restaurant in the area.  I've walked by this place while visiting St. Lawrence from what I could see looks like a nice place.  The food is a bit pricey but I expect to pay a little more at good restaurants.  This isn't your sketchy i wonder if the kitchen is clean type of restraint."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly, the ambience is nice, but the food is rather bland, which is bizarre for Indian food. Everything I tried felt like it had been stripped of spices, flavour and aroma to appeal to a more Caucasian audience. It's a nice place in every other regard, but the food just isn't very good or flavourful."}
{"text":"magnifique restaurant, accueil rafiné, menu intéressant , dix sur dix pour les plats, restaurant à recommander"}
{"text":"Great food!!! The owner went out of her way to make our dinning experience pleasurable.  This isn't your Gerrard Street Indian restaurant so the prices are higher.  Their tandoori shrimp was amazing, I would highly recommend it. We would go again."}
{"text":"We vacationed in downtown Toronto for ten days and this restaurant had the best food. The ingredients were fresh and delicious. I especially liked the grilled lamb chops. The owner and her staff did a very fine job."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner last night. The food was very authentic. Michelle did a great job. She was very helpful with accommodating our last minute reservation and also a great service. I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Better late than never! I went to this place few times but my experience was great for first few times but the last time when i visited was horrible experience. We ordered for Dal Makhni and Paneer dish with some bread, Dal Makhni has onion more than lentils which I found very weird. Chef came to our table when we about to pay to check how was the food, I was biting my tongue not to give any feedback but couldn't help it. I said there was so much onion in the dish where originally dal makhni shouldn't have onion or diced tomatoes in it. I was shocked by chef's reply he said i know this has been twisted to cater North American taste and i agree this is not how it should be, even I will not eat that. I was like what you are the chef and the owner of the restaurant how can you say something like that to a customer  who is paying at your restaurant for your dish which you will not eat yourself. 

I will never coming back again to this restaurant neither will recommend anyone. There are many good restaurants around for the same price and much better taste."}
{"text":"I went for the Winterlicious menu (which I often use as a sampler to judge a restaurant). After I went home, I couldn't find some of the options on their menu...? Not sure why I couldn't find it... 

To start with, the ambiance is simple and clean looking. A very minimalistic look. We had waited no more than a minute before being seated (with reservations) and were treated politely throughout our meal. Water refills were frequent when our glasses were empty, and we were asked several times over, how our meals were, and to have our empty plates taken away promptly when finished. I would give service pretty much 4 stars.

For the food, I started with the Fish Pakora. It was not fish pakora... I've had fish pakora before, and what I received was more like a fish stick on salad greens. With some spicy sauce drizzled over it. Not impressed. It's not on their usual menu (not at the time this is written), and I would doubt it will stay long on their menu if they choose to put it on there. Their main, I had Palak Chana, which I also couldn't find on their menu. It was yummy, I ate every bit of it with the naan served. My friend had the butter chicken; I tried it, didn't think much of it. Lastly, I had the Kheer for dessert. It was yummy. Over all, I would give the food a 3 stars. I didn't enjoy the fish stick-like \"fish pakora\", nor was I blown away by their butter chicken, but I did like their Palak Chana. An important thing I want to mention is that their food was not oily, or too spicy (when eaten with naan or rice) which can be rare to find when I go out for Indian food. And the food was not super salty making me want to chug litres of water. Just for the last comments, I'd give them an extra 0.5 star.

I think we have to assume that there's going to be possible changes to authenticity being that we're not in India. (Or maybe it's pure and authentic? I don't know?) But I'm rating it based on my experience, and although I may not go back at a regular time for some of the food I didn't like, I am partial to most vegetarian items on the menu of most Indian restaurant and would likely go back to try other vegetarian items on Bindia's menu."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my meal here. I tried the butter chicken and had the rice pudding for dessert. 

Their chai tea is amaaazing!!"}
{"text":"There's a new row of restaurants across from St Lawrence Market on Market St. All newly renovated, perfectly wide open with patios for a gorgeous summer day.  It's quite attractive to go to as a local working in the area.

Bit of a mistake - went for a lunch and the portion size was disappointing.  $15 for a wrap with no salad is not what would be considered value.  The waiter did ask what our thoughts were, and I expressed my dismay at the size of the wrap for the price.  Most people like to see a little bit of food on their plate when served, and even a couple of strands of lettuce would have made it feel more appealing even if it really wasn't.

Will have to say no to going back I'm afraid.  Rather go to a closer Indian restaurant where $15 will get you all you can eat buffet."}
{"text":"This place was so good. Great food and really attentive service. I came here with a friend for dinner after a conference nearby. We had the bhuna lamb, bhindi masala and chicken tikka masala. it was all wonderful. Our server was very helpful with recommendations and very attentive. Then the chef came over mid-meal. And instead of it being a drive-by \"how's everything,\" he spent some time with us asking specifically about each dish (What did you like? Would you change anything?) It was warm and inviting. 

This was a great place. Nice modern decor with clean lines and bright accents. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Pretty  good  lunch  menu   the lamb  curry is really good   quite and cozy  atmosphere.   Reasonable prices"}
{"text":"We've been to Bindia a number of times and it has become one of our favourite places in the downtown core. Quaint location on Market Street, solid Indian cuisine and friendly staff.  We particularly like the tandoori salmon and great vegetarian dishes.  You won't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"I dined early on a Saturday and as I was solo, I was seated at the bar. I was given a papadum and it had a hair in it. I mentioned this and received a new one. When I received the bill I was a bit surprised that they hadn't taken off anything as a way of apologising... it is gross receiving food with hair in it! 

I come from Australia and on the odd chance something like that happened, it is customary for a discount of some kind to be applied. 

The restaurant was lovely, however it was very expensive for Indian food."}
{"text":"The place is modern but I find the restaurant design a bit \"off\". It is just a personal thing but I look for the whole dining experience including the eating environment, ambiance, service and so on.

We were greeted warmly. The server was friendly and provided good food recommendations. 

Food was good but the servings were very small. A kid (I think he's the owner's son) was roaming around trying to talk to his mom which I found a bit unprofessional, and dangerous too. 

Overall the experience was so-so and I am not sure if I will return."}
{"text":"Nice little spot and great to have some good Indian food in the area now! Definitely a bit pricier than a lot of Indian food restaurants, but it's on par for prices in the area. Also not quite as bursting with flavour as most places in Little India would provide, but has a real home-cooked kind of taste and feel. Their homemade paneer and the masala dishes are especially good."}
{"text":"Agree with all previous posters.   Short review here.   Really good food.  Only smallish complaint is that I found lunch portions just a bit small.   

Excellent food.   Great service.  Tasteful venue."}
{"text":"I went there for the first time on Sat with a friend after reading favourable reviews. We both enjoyed the food and was impressed that the waitress was very knowledgable about the various dishes. Cozy ambience, fast service and great food so if you're in the mood for Indian food check out Bindia."}
{"text":"Bindia is an EXCELLENT Indian restaurant. I've been there a couple times now and their butter chicken and naan are top notch. 

Ambience is very modern and clean.

Servers are very friendly and the Punjabi old fashioned cocktail is delicious. I ask for mine less sweet."}
{"text":"Food was awesome! Service was very friendly, attentive and informative. We tried several things on the menu, it was all delicious. We opted for medium spice and it was on the spicier side for my wife but perfect for me. If you don't like it hot stick with the mild. Go and enjoy great Indian in a great neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"I found the food to be really good, a welcome step up from most Indian restaurants in this city. 

I went on a weekday and on a weekend and the waitstaff were very helpful and pleasant. I had the Tandoori Platter, and all items were superb and freshly prepared, not half cooked then served up as reheated. The chicken briyani is one of the best I have ever tasted in the city. The Malai Kofta were very good, as well as the naan: light and fluffy not thick and chunky.
My Favorite: The lamb Samosas! Perfectly spiced and not oily but light and flaky. 

No excess oil or greasiness to any of the food, and the portions are fairly good also. 

A great dining experience overall and next time Ill bring the family. :)"}
{"text":"Pretty pricey for dinner but it was pretty good. We got the Masala Lamb and Tandoori chicken with garlic naan and rice. I really liked the sauce the tandoori chicken came with. My only complaint is that the waitress had her thumb in our masala lamb as she put it on the table. (But I was so hungry I didn't want to send it back)"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a Friday lunch, was not very busy. I had the lunch special paneer makhani (came with a Naan and a tiny salad) for $13.95. My lunchmates tried the appetizer platter and butter chicken specials. The food was delicious, but it seemed a little on the high end price-wise. Service was great."}
{"text":"Best restaurant I've eaten in in Toronto! I am a vegan and they so many options, even a whole vegetarian menu, many of which are vegan. Even the naan they were able to make a vegan version which is already on the menu. Extremely recommended!!"}
{"text":"After just leaving Bombay palace because it was on my buffet we headed down to discover this little gem! Quite pricey, but quality! Portions aren't big but the flavours are rich and delicious and I feel you don't need a large portion to feel satisfied. Lost a star because of the tandoori chicken... It was meh and we were all quite disappointed. 
But the beef vidaloo, excellent.. butter chicken, the best I've had... The fish appetizer (can't remember the name), delicious! Samosaa, yum. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"The service was a little slow (we came for a late lunch/early dinner, so it was at an odd time when there was really nobody else in the restaurant), but the food we ordered was pretty good"}
{"text":"This lovely restaurant is a very welcome addition to the St. Lawrence market area! The staff are exceptional, the food is phenomenal and the decor is gorgeous. Definitely try their stuffed naan - it's delicious!"}
{"text":"Came back, good food, but slightly uncoordinated service.

This time around the servers were just as nice as before.  However, I believe they could use more organization.  They were definitely working/hustling with things, but not in a coordinated manner from the look of it.  The worst part of the example: a set of dishes left on the patio for hours in the evening.  I wouldn't go back on a Saturday.

The other drawback from this visit: out of Cheetah draft.  Guys, c'mon... don't run dry on your tap on a Saturday evening.  I didn't want anything else to drink, that's your moneymaker!!

I'd still come back though, not on Saturday.  Perhaps I'll call and confirm if they have Cheetah on tap before I come."}
{"text":"This is a lovely modern place with nice atmosphere. We ordered chicken butter and chicken curry which was delicious. The service was good and staff was polite. Also, our meal served in nice traditional dishes."}
{"text":"This was an impromptu visit to this place as the fast food (health food focused) had an unbearable ventilation problem (yes Kale stinks!) We walked in and mentioned that we wanted a quick meal as had a play to catch later nearby. 
Ordering was fast we ordered a Chilli Chicken (Haka Style) and a malai tikka. We ordered some nans as well. 
The service is prompt and we got our food rather quickly. 
First the chilli chicken if you have western palate this one has little bit of kick no surprise. As for the taste hmm didn't do it much for me. The malai tikka was fantastic and cooked to perfection IMO. Soft and not over cooked even though they used white meat. I will just be back to try their other tandoor options as this one hit out of the park. 
3.5 Stars though will adjust after I have tried their other offerings."}
{"text":"Remarkable Indian food for Toronto, especially this neighbourhood.  The food was very fresh and I learned that they source their food from the St Lawrence Market across the street. 
The lamb Vindaloo was was delicious, but don't be shy about ordering your food spicy if you like it hot.  
Service was friendly and prompt. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I don't think anything went right at this restaurant. One appetizer never arrived. The samosa had nothing in it. We were totally ignored by the waiter. The bill was wrong. Disaster in a bucket..."}
{"text":"After a long day of volunteer work, my mom and I were starving we walked down the street to Bindia. Located near St. Lawrence Market is a brightly coloured bistro with ambient lighting and an inspired menu.

Butter Chicken, Curry Chicken and fresh naan were in order. The presentation was great and made for easy sharing. The Butter Chicken was creamy and had just the right amount of spice. Paired with the naan, I was in my glory. My mom's Curry Chicken was hotter than she expected, but the seasoning was delightful. So savoury! If you're wondering, we both needed water and extra napkins....that's how we roll.  

After all that savoury goodness, it was time for dessert. We tried the Gajrela(Indian Carrot Cake) and Kulfi(Indian ice cream flavoured with cardamom). Neither was what we expected. As you can see, the carrot cake was not a cake. It had cashews, carrot puree and nuts. That is one heavy cake! It kept you trying to figure out what is in it. It has so many different textures and layers; I'd absolutely order it again. The Kulfi was not as enjoyable. It looked like ice cream, it was cold like ice cream, but it was not ice cream. The presentation was great, but the texture of it was strange. Flavoured with cardamom, it didn't have much flavour. I do realize I'm used to the sugary variety, but after such a savoury meal, something a sweet should've stood out. The carrot cake is the way to go. 

The service there was good and the food was fresh. When we were puzzled by the carrot cake, our server was very knowledgeable(probably a common inquiry) and was able to solve some of the mystery. Plates were cleared quickly and our water glasses were (thankfully) kept full. The pricing was higher than we're used to, but from Durham Region and expect most restaurants in Toronto to be higher anyway.  

I wonder what other gems are around the St. Lawrence!"}
{"text":"We love trying Indian food while traveling and make it a priority to try some from every place we visit. This was a fantastic restaurant located conveniently near St. Lawrence Market. The service was great and we had no issues throughout our meal. The food was fantastic and the butter chicken in particular was delicious. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal and would definitely come back if we're in Toronto again!"}
{"text":"Originally found this place through Yelp, and decided to try it out while on a visit to the area.

It was a quiet night for dinner, so we were seated in a nearly empty restaurant. It's a bit of a shame, since the food was delicious! Over the course of our dinner, multiple people came in for takeout. At the end of our meal, our server asked for feedback and we expressed how surprised we were that it wasn't more busy.

I had the butter chicken, and my partner had the mint tikka. We ordered a side of rice and fresh naan to go with our meals. I had a glass of house wine ($8.50) which was refreshing to cool down the spices.

Our dishes were well portioned and seasoned. I would certainly suggest ordering rice and naan to dip the delicious sauces. My partner's chicken was seasoned particularly well.

The service was attentive but not at that annoying level where we were constantly interrupted. The waiter would quietly come and check up on us, and we appreciated that.

Definitely a nice spot for a casual dinner!"}
{"text":"My colleague and I were looking for a place for dinner nearby that had a good rating and not too expensive. He found this place on Yelp and we agreed to check it out. On first appearance nothing was impressive. We were reading the menu by the front door when a waitress walked up from outside and wanted to go in. Not one word. Not \"Welcome!\" Not, \"Excuse me.\" Not \"May I help you.\" We just moved back, she opened the door and walked in. Something is already wrong. It took a bit of time for our waiter to finally take our order. I ordered the Chicken Tikka over lentils and my colleague ordered Butter Chicken plus naan. The order came out at a reasonable time. However, I noticed no lentils. Curious as that is not what I ordered. I waited for the waiter to come over and ask about the meal so I could ask to see the menu. That did not happen until we were done 45 minutes later. And our water was refilled only at that time as well. When we were done. So I ask for the menu and sure enough, chicken over lentils. So I ask the waiter what dish he served and we were on the same page. I asked how come there were no lentils. He then tells me the chef took it off the dish last week because customers complained and were allergic. Huh?! If your allergic why would you order the dish to begin with?! If you didn't like lentils why would you order the dish?! And why would you not tell the customer before they ordered the dish?! So we asked for the check after I told him it would have been nice to know that ahead if time. \"That's why the chef gave you more salad.\" ????? He dropped off the bill and then returned ten minutes later. Poor service, lackluster decor, the food is unmemorable, the atmosphere drab, no way does this place deserve the current Yelp rating."}
{"text":"Good location and decor. Restaurant was very clean compared to other Indian restaurants.   Average Indian food (I have been to many other restaurant). Service was also below average."}
{"text":"If you're in the area and looking for decent indian food but a la date night styles, Bindia is a fine bet. Be careful on the up-selling of certain dishes and drinks; this is a touristy area and the service matches this fact."}
{"text":"Samosa appi was the best I've ever had...and I'm from Brampton :) . Great service. Had the chicken Biryani ..delicious. Naan was good. Lamb vindaloo excellent. Would go again. Intimate little gem."}
{"text":"wanted to have some nice indian dinner with a friend of mine last night. A plate at the entrance \"Wait to be seated\"; ok, so we we've been waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting -  nobody showed up, although both waiters saw us and only 2 tables out of 10? 15? have been taken. What else to do than to turn back and leave. Luckily!! We had a great time at nearby 'Barsa' although it wasn't in our plans. That's how \"arogant\" places lose their customers."}
{"text":"Too expensive for its own taste
Perhaps the only if not one of the very few Indian restaurant in the GTA which will charge you for the usual condiments- papadum, onion and chilies or even pickle. Relax- they did not charge for tap water.
Service- the 'I know it all and leave it to me ' attitude waiter did provide reasonable service and the food was served pretty quickly. 
Food- overall good taste . Fish curry was excellent; vindaloo was 'hot' but did not carry the 'soul' taste ; Gobi aloo seemed to taste like two vegetables; chicken tandoori pieces were simply too big to give the tandoor flavor; avoid the aloo chaat which is served in wrong serving dish to begin with.
Yes the overall quality and taste of food is above average of most Indian restaurants but is lost in its over confidence and higher than usual prices.
Good but can be in excellent bracket if more time is spent in final touches both by the cook and the serving staff rather than speed and prices trimmed to be in the palettable range."}
{"text":"I recently ordered take-out and when I got home my precious butter chicken was missing.  So I called the resto and the lovely owner calmly just followed up about the mix-up, apologized for the mix-up and offered to deliver it to my place.  Sooner than I had expected, I saw the owner herself show up at my door with the missed order and an order of rice pudding as a recompense.  But what struck me is that not only was she extremely efficient but she was grace under fire.  So I am close to having ordered everything in the menu and everything ranges from good to excellent, but the great customer service makes me always come back to this spot.  Now that they deliver I am over the moon!"}
{"text":"As an Indian food know-it-all, my test for Indian restaurants typically involves two visits or orders. Bindia is the only one that has consistently served me amazing food three deliveries in a row. My secret test where Indian food goes is to order the kofta. Its a mild curry but its really easy to screw up the flavours - as all Indian restaurants have done each time I've ordered it. Bindia has delivered amazing kofta dishes two times in a row - combined with their pulao, it was just a ridiculous combo. 

Their lamb seekh kabab is juicy and flavourful too. The only very small let-down was their nan which was thick/pasty in some parts, thin in others. 

This restaurant is only Indian restaurant downtown that I think I will keep visiting. 

Excellent food. Go!"}
{"text":"Bindia would be an all-around lovely authentic Indian restaurant if it had been priced more appropriately. It is not overly expensive, but just outside the sweetspot that made me feel a bit ripped off.

We came in on a Sunday afternoon around 5-6pm, was seated right away on the nice sunny patio, but had to wait for a tad bit for the food to finally arrive. We ordered lamb briyana and daal (lentil), with garlic naan on the side. Both came in 7 on the spicy scale - and god I must say, the food hit the spot - it was spicy to the front of the tongue and back! I loved it, even though I had to endure that \"hot\" thrill for 20-30 min.

All in all, food is a 4, ambience is a 4, but unfortunately it was just expensive enough that everything had to be downrated a bit to a 3."}
{"text":"Going to this modern Indian cuisine restaurant was a bit of a toss up initially but starting from the reservation process (an hour prior you get a convenient text asking for confirmation) to the crispy Coconut Calamari to the last drop of body warming chai tea, it came up ACES for:
*taste
*service
*ambience
*cleanliness
*timing

While waiting for our entrees, we were delighted to try their cute little papadum cones drizzled in some kind of tamarind sauce. 

We ordered Butter chicken--the true test whether this would cut it in my books. For this classic creamy dish, this modern establishment tosses tender cubes of chicken, smooth tomatoey goodness and a spice I couldn't put my finger on that trailed with a slight kick-and it wasn't the heat either--the spice-o-meter being only medium. The fluffy basmati rice provided the perfect compliment to the aromatic sauce. 

SERVICE: was prompt, attentive and courteous from  our friendly waitress who had a faint Spanish accent. In fact, most of the wait staff were a multicultural sort befitting the modern fusion blend. 

I would have tried a dessert like rasmalai if I wasn't so full. It always amazes me how deceiving the small steel bowls of sauce appear---always too small for my eyes and too big for my stomach!!! Instead I was satisfied with the slightly sweet and nutty taste of their fragrant chai tea. Was a bit surprised at how fast they served the tea as most Indian restaurants make their tea from scratch and it usually takes much longer so I can't guarantee that it's house made. 

All in all my husband and I enjoyed our dinner in their romantic setting-dimmed lights, candles on tables, in a modern decor with high ceilings. I would definitely visit again!!! Besides it's right across from the St. Lawrence Market and the streets are festive at night in the month of December for a beautiful evening walk."}
{"text":"I only rarely give Indian restaurants a shot without a word of mouth recommendation from someone because there are just way too many novice owners who don't understand what it takes to be CONSISTENT in providing good quality food. 

Well I took a blind chance on Bindia because it was a cold soggy evening in Toronto and I did feel like walking to my usual places on Younge St and boy did I stroked GOLD!

The owner is a consummate restauranteur, very affable young sikh who makes each guest feel special. The décor, the ambience, the service and above all, the delicious food makes this a must visit restaurants footer me on every trip to YYZ."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic! 

Great little new addition to the neighborhood we had Chicken miki & Butter Chicken. It was divine we also shared some Vegetable samosas with a wonderful sauce and some nice cold Kingfisher beers ! 
Great spot wonderful menu outstanding service and will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Everything we had at Bindia was extremely tasty!!! Great service and nice decor.  Good place to go for a quiet and relaxing dinner in the summer."}
{"text":"So so yummy. All the dishes were great: shrimp tandoori,  butter chicken, biryani,  tikka masala paneer.  Def a new favorite!  Closes at 9.30 so come early."}
{"text":"I ordered take-away and wasn't particularly impressed by either entree. We ordered Chicken Tikka Masala and Chicken Vindaloo which were both bland. It was also quite pricey and seems sort of \"à la carte\" because none of the entrees come with naan, chutney, or rice and these usual inclusions are pricey here. If you order on their site and pay in cash, you'll receive a 10% discount."}
{"text":"Les samosas végétariens sont délicieux et le poulet au beurre est un des meilleur que nous avons mangé"}
{"text":"A little disappointed with their food after reading so many good reviews here. I've had better curries at other Indian places in Toronto, and the sad part is most of those other places don't cost nearly as much as Bindia charges. Tried the butter chicken and the coconut fish curry. The ginger chunk in the coconut fish curry is really disruptive, both in taste and in texture. The butter chicken lacks rich flavor except being little sour. They claimed that the naan was freshly made, but one of our order of naan wasn't warm. The texture isn't as chewy as the ones I had before at other places. I usually crave for a good naan. But after eating one piece of it, I don't mind stopping right there. Given the premium prices they charge, I expect a much higher quality. Overall, I was quite disappointed."}
{"text":"Services and food flavors are great. Plates are gourmet style so do not expect very Indian food. Overall great food."}
{"text":"Expensive, small portions, nothing is included (separate costs for carbs and chutneys). But food is decent and never too crowded, so fairly easy to have a conversation here without yelling over the crowd.

Food- 4/5. I'm not an Indian food guru by all means, but have tried a few downtown places (259 Host, Aroma, Little India, etc) that I feel pretty satisfied with the presentation and flavors of the food here. We are vegetarian, so can't comment on their animal proteins. We ordered sev poori (vegetarian) as the appetizer and it was delicious! Crispy and airy on the outside and dusted with chickpea noodles (has no taste, reminds me of dry Mr. Noodles ramen). Gooey mash potato and sweet chutney on the inside. 

For mains, we've ordered the okra dish before and that was kind of bland and boring tbh - would not recommend. However, the dal makhani (lentils and beans stew) and bhartha (spicy indian eggplant) that we ordered tonight were quite tasty, not too spicy or salty. In fact, I asked for medium spice level for the bhartha, but it only had a super subtle hint of spicy-ness that even my spicy-adverse partner could barely detect. I recommend the bhartha if you're looking for something without the caloric cream and cheeses and simply want to incorporate more veggies into your diet. The dal makhani was tasty too, but too runny imo. Had the viscosity of soup; wish it had been thicker.

Just a positive note about the plain naan here- the lightest naan I've ever experienced at an Indian restaurant and that is a good thing. at least from a health standpoint! Slightly burnt from the oven, but no taste-able or visible trace of butter, so assuming none added? Unlike usual naan, which is super greasy/buttery and dense, the naan at Bindia is thin and dry, almost like a pita. If you desire heavier naan, order the garlic or butter naan.

Value- 1/5. Small mains, but pretty filling, especially if you order something with paneer (cheese) or meat. Mains are at least $15, so makes Bindia one of the most expensive Indian restaurants downtown. You must order sauces (i.e. mango chutney) and carbs (naan, whole wheat roti, rice) on the side separately if you desire.

Service- 4/5. Frequent water refills, friendly, professional. A bit slow to get the bill, but no big.

Venue- 4/5. Quiet, small. Located right beside the St. Lawrence market, so very close to the Financial District. Perfect for dates or business lunches or dinners. The interior is classy enough to dress up a bit if you want to."}
{"text":"I love Indian food. Foods of Bindia was ok, all the dishes were quite good actually. But they offer little bit high price, and there are no many options. Customer service was ok, but in overall, it was expensive."}
{"text":"While the food was tasty, I think the portions are too small and the mains are overpriced. $17 for a tiny portion of butter chicken that does not even come with rice (you have to order it separately as a side dish) is too expensive. There are better Indian restaurants in the city that give far better portions at a more reasonable price."}
{"text":"Excellent Indian dishes! Best I've had to date. Chicken is juicy and tender. Garlic nan is scrumptious. Aloo ghoobi is delish. You don't want to just pass by this place... you must stop and eat! Chicken tikka masala is sooooo goooood! Yummy."}
{"text":"Tried the lamb option in their lunch menu. Tasted as expected and spiced just right. I opted for the naan option. The side salad that came with it could use some vinaigrette. Located right beside St Lawrence Market, the place is great whenever the weather permits outdoor dining. Tastes good though I would not say it was exceptional."}
{"text":"Great menu and reasonably priced. Food presentation was unique and very tasty! Staff was attentive and quick but not rushed. Very warm, comfortable feel to the restaurant would make it a cozy spot for large or small groups. Highly recommend this gem on Market St."}
{"text":"I ordered the vegan: dal makhani, aloo gobi (cauliflower potato), pakoras and baingan bharta (eggplant). I got all mild, but I would've called it \"medium\" since the heat overtook any subtler flavours there may have been. 

I've had Indian food in little India, India, and gourmet Indian like Dawat in NYC. Honestly, I don't think any Indian food in Toronto is that great. 

I liked that the peas were fresh-ish in the eggplant, and that you could taste fresh ginger, but it was all very oily. My fave item was probably the pakoras, though I'd prefer them air-fried. I do tend to prefer South Indian cuisine, but this place was ok. They could work on subtler, complex flavours, less oil and adding even more fresh stuff to the dishes -- top the dal with chopped tomato and cilantro (and add some coriander seed, like, way more to the dal, it was bland!). 

Portions for takeaway I found huge."}
{"text":"This is one of those Indian places where there is literally no bad food on the menu. It's not experimental, but extremely decent and pleasing!! Nice facilities also. Highly recommendable."}
{"text":"Cute place near St. Lawrence Market. The owners definitely care a lot about customer reviews and satisfaction. We were unhappy with the Biryani, so the owner made sure we got a brand new biryani :) Definitely would be back, the service and atmosphere was amazing."}
{"text":"Decent Indian food for downtown Toronto. I came with a group of 4 after work on a Thursday. Despite half the party arriving late, we never felt rushed. The food is a little on the more expensive end compared to some of the Indian restaurants we are used to eating out at in Mississauga, but it makes sense as the restaurant setting and the services is much nicer. 

The menu has a good variety, and the waiters were very accommodating in terms of dietary restrictions (nuts) and spice tolerance (we wanted medium-high, and they warned us approriately so!). The chicken in the chicken curry was nice and tender, the okra was flavourful and had a great texture, but the spinach paneer was definitely the highlight of the four curry dishes that we ordered. It was creamy, rich, and there was a hefty amount of paneer. The naan bread was a little on the light and flaky side, whereas we prefer it a bit more chewy and dense. 

We didn't stay for dessert, but overall we left satisfied, and would likely return again if we wanted Indian food downtown again."}
{"text":"My go to Indian resto in the city. Yes it's expensive but consider what you get.
Dishes with differentiated flavours (unlike a lot of others that all taste like the same base sauce was used for everything).
Really high quality meats and vegetables treated with respect.
The vindaloo is relatively hot (for me) but most others would find it quite hot but the flavour does come through. Do remember this is Indian food and if you eat Asian cuisine it will be hot. Don't like heat? The Golden arches are looking for consumers like you. Please don't try and dumb down the food by whining about mild being too hot.
Sign up for their mailing list and you get a nice coupon on your birthday - bonus!
Finally I discovered a stunning Shiraz. Wakefield is available at the LCBO and has got some great reviews on WIne Align."}
{"text":"The restaurant is located right beside St. Lawrence market, on a smaller side-street off Front. The entrance is small, but opens up into a larger nicely decorated space that could easily accommodate larger groups. We came here over the holidays and found the service very accommodating. Several of our group had dietary restrictions and our waitress was very patient with walking them through options. 

The food itself was okay but not the most memorable, nothing to complain about but nothing too memorable. Value-wise, each main is minimum around $15 for a small metal bowl. I found it filling enough, but be advised that you have to order the naan/rice as an additional side. A acceptable choice if you are in the area and craving Indian food."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review with the statement that I love Indian cuisine and was impressed with the quality of the food at this restaurant.
A group of 4 of us made reservations for a Saturday for lunch, with plans to hit the restaurant first, then wander through St. Lawrence Market afterwards. Sort of a day exploring an old haunt.
Two of us (myself being one of them) arrived just prior to noon and we went to the hostess station, where a staff member was on the phone. She raised her hand and gave us \"just a second\" gesture...which turned into longer than she expected. A server came over and seated us while she continued to talk in the phone. 
When the rest of our group arrived, rather than order individual lunch specials (which sounded wonderful, we decided to order a-la-cart, as the staff member advised us that the individual serving size was 1/2 of the a-la-cart serving size.
We ordered paneer, lamb biryani, butter chicken, Chana masala and two orders of nan bread. Our server asked what heat level we wanted and as one member of our group has issues with spice, we went medium. I didn't find the food spicy, but the person who dislikes spicy foods struggled a bit with the heat. I would have preferred more heat...but that's not the restaurants fault. 
Our food came out in approximately 10-15 minutes and was quite flavourful, full of depth which the complexity of Indian cuisine is known for. The butter chicken was top notch, the Chana masala excellent, the paneer was just so-so and the lamb biryani was wonderful (I'll admit I didn't eat any of the lamb itself...just had the rice). 
Our waiter was excellent...checked on us over the course of our meal, filling water glasses, etc. Ambiance of the restaurant is casual but warm.
So...why not 5 stars ? 
Well....while the food was excellent, I've been to other Indian restaurants where the food was of comparable quality but had a more robust quantity. In other words, while good, it's a tad overpriced for the amount of food you get. When the dishes were brought out, all four of us were shocked at how little food was put down in front of us. The biriyani was the only item where we didn't feel shortchanged. $19 for what is essentially enough butter chicken for two people is very overpriced IMHO.
Lunch as described above, with 4 masala chai teas came to around $100 tax in."}
{"text":"Exceptional service and delightful food. Our mixologist seemed to have been learning but the experience was great."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday evening and the place was busy, but we were still able to get a table for two at about 6pm. The place is modern and clean, the service is average and the ambiance seems a little more sophisticated downtown than cultural in any way. 

I will say that it was more expensive than your average Indian restaurant, but I think that just has to do with the location more than anything. 

We ordered the paneer makhani, naan, and the lamb briyani. Food arrived quickly and it was hot and fresh. The paneer was soft, and the sauce was delicious and very flavourful. The lamb briyani had chunks of lamb and was a huge portion. The rice was well seasoned, and all the different spices could distinctly be tasted. The naan was soft and crunchy in different parts, and was cut up into different sized pieces. We got everything spicy (mild, medium spicy options existed), and there was an actual kick to all the dishes (it was definitely a slow build king of spicy, but it was delicious). 

I would definitely come back, but the price might prevent me from coming frequently."}
{"text":"Really good service with decent prices. Ordered vegetable pakora, haryali tikki , dal makhani and garlic naan. Nice and cozy place. The food was fresh and delicious. Would definitely recommend it for dinner."}
{"text":"Five stars means as good as it gets. It's a tad pricier than other Indian restaurants, and the wait-time on the food is considerable, but it's the best Indian food I've had in the city.

The Tandoori was especially delicious and very well made."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Ordered Malai Kofta with Naan, girlfriend ordered Chicken Tikka. Both were delicious. The atmosphere and layout of the restaurant were both beautiful as well. Only complaint would be the Chai wasn't that great, but that wasn't too big of a deal once the food came out. All in all, will definitely visit again next time we're in Toronto."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is nice with indoor and patio seating, However, I found the place a bit pricey given the small portions. Taste wise, I felt that the Indian food was more refined here and seemed a lot healthier than what I'm used to. As a big group, we got to try the butter chicken, chicken tikka masala, achaari paneer Tikka and chicken tikka. I especially liked the paneer because it was my first time trying that dish! An F.Y.I for you is that the mains don't come with anything so you also have to order naan or rice on the side depending on what you prefer. We had the garlic naan and regular naan which was good for dipping the various dishes. Overall, I thought the lack of value coupled with bad service (wrong order, slow) ruined the visit for me."}
{"text":"Thank you Yelpers; we went here on your advise and were richly rewarded for our trust.

This was to be our last night in Toronto and we wanted it to be special.  Yes; goal achieved.  We started out with the appetizer sampler. We had four separate items, two kinds if samosa, a pakora and a puff. Three of four were wonderful; we got a hot sauce and a tamarind. We then ordered butter chicken, shrimp korma and lamb vindaloo.  All were well sliced, full flavored and the meat was tender. These are rich sauces. We asked for medium spicy and that Is what we got. We paired the entrees with rice and garlic naan, which were tender and garlicky.  Everything was just right.

We paired the appetizer with a Prosecco and the entrees with a Malbec. The Prosecco was just right, but the Malbec could have been a bit better.  The prices were fair.

We had good service.  All in all, the evening exceeded expectations. We are happy we stopped in here; we will come again. You should as well."}
{"text":"Been here over 8 times in the past three years.
It's time I came I was very impressed and food was great.
Staff were friendly nice selection of food.
Tho after months, I returned and noticed menus has shrunk and some meal items were non longer there. 
About A month ago I came for lunch. There were two staff members there one wearing a black top with the ribbon of Saint George embroidered around it's collar, which I thought that not a good idea to have a political statement in a restaurant. You are free to display any political ideas or statements but at your own time and not when working. 
I saw another thing that bothered me... the bartender braking the cardinal rule of bar... he handles the glass from the rim and scooped ice with it, poured the soda and served it to a guest. 
I hope the other staff corrected his action.
 The meal I had was chicken curry and rice. It was okay, not a lot of flavour but okay.  So I defied to give it another try, I came by for lunch and ordered a coconut calamari for appetizer...
It was way over cooked and dry. Almost no taste not something I'd order again.
I also ordered chicken tikkmasala it was a little salty and the chicken was over cooked meaning it was dry.

I always see improvement here but I hope they can do better."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. I am fasting and awaiting my food patiently. Aftee the hour mark, i called the restaurant and they informed that the person left around 10 mins and shld be there soon. Then i called again after twenty minutes from my call and they were still not there and they said they were downstairs and after 7minutes i couldnt take it anymore and cancelled my order. I kept waiting for this order and stupid enough that i depended on this restaurant to feed me while i am starving and havent had any food all day. Beyond ridiculous!!"}
{"text":"The food at Bindia is definitely tasty and well prepared. I don't care if it is authentic or not, as long as it tastes good and it does. But there are a lot of good Indian places in Toronto which are similar, for a lot less. The prices here are higher, and you get less protein/paneer in comparison too. You are basically paying a premium because of the location and space.

Definitely cute and clean, and the service was fast.
We had the lamb vindaloo and it had just the right amount of spice. The stuffed naan was also great. I had never had stuffed naan before and it was definitely worth the extra money compared to the regular naan."}
{"text":"Perfect, service and food are both amazing! We ordered chicken tikka and kebab, they are both very tasty, the soup is great too"}
{"text":"The food was amazing, the service was great, the waiter was so patient with my group (they were loud and impolite, telling him how to do his job), but he stay calm and nice and skilled the all time. He was also very considerate, one person in my group thought the butter chicken was too spicy, so he offered her a free raïta. At the end I apologized and left a big tips, and he said there was nothing to apologized for. Amazing food, amazing waiter, I will be back."}
{"text":"Where to start?  
The food was good. The taste was great. I went with my husband for a late dinner. 
We ordered two different types of curries. 
He ordered a spicy broth and I wanted a mild close to the least spicy they could make it. I've been avoiding super spicy food for health reasons. 
The food took FOREVER to come out. For some reason the food simply took a long time to prepare. 
Delivery guys kept coming in to pick up orders and they would be waiting a long time for those orders. One actually waited an hour for his order he had to deliver. He ended up moving to the bar to grab a chair because he got tired of waiting at the door. We eventually got our curry bowls. That's it. We were there a good 45 mins waiting for two small bowls of curry. No rice. No salad. Nothing. So we decided to order a side of naan(pita) to accompany our curry. Well. I lost my sense of smell. Hahaha they got our orders backwards. I had the crazy spicy inferno lamb curry and my husband got the super mild salmon curry. It tasted pretty good. I love spicy food but again just for health reasons I have been avoiding it. The waitress offered to take it back but I was afraid we would be here the whole evening. I felt bad for the delivery guy because we were eating while he still was waiting for his pick up order. I can't say the food or service was bad. They weren't. I just would have hopped for a garnish or two? Or to be if we wanted rice/carbs to go with our bowl? It didn't look appetizing to be completely honest but it tasted great. We were there a long, long, time for what we ordered. The delivery people coming in to wait were witnesses."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch one day on our trip to Toronto. We ordered the lamb vindaloo and aaloo gobhi, as well as naan. The food was very good, however, it does not come with rice, which we had to order after the food came. Service was pretty good. Just the pricing, which perhaps is due to it's location also, is over-priced. I know the typical portion size for these dishes, and this is what I expect, however I wouldn't expect to pay 19 for a small bowl of vindaloo."}
{"text":"Update (10/20/15): the owner very kindly reached out to me to acknowledge the lack of friendly service I received during my visit. That was very nice of him. It's good to know those within the city's restaurant business are striving for improvement and acknowledge the concerns of the patron. 
Perhaps I *will* return."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant ever! living less than 100 meters from this place, unable to deliver in less than 25 min, useless delivery guy, delivering cold food, and sensitive \"woman\" who can't handle customer calling to complain.
 Yes, miss, you are right, there are other restaurants in Toronto, you are just damn too useless to own a business and take care of the only thing you should take care: your customers!!! Ciao."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday evening between shows with a group of 7. The service and food were great. The mushroom tikka masala special was really good. Everyone enjoyed their dishes.
The ambience is also very nice. Good cocktail and decent wine selection. If in the area, I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Lamb kabob and chicken kabob platters were out of this world! Great service and ambiance. The most juiciest indian grill dishes in the GTA!"}
{"text":"Very nice upscale Indian food. Though they can't seem to make our spicy, but they offer peppers oh the side that are hot.

The vegetable pakoras are a must appetizers and the paneer Tikka Masala extra spicy is the bomb."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service, wonderful menu and the best cocktails in the city. Everything is fresh about this place. Butter chicken is amazing. Get the chicken tikka, delicious."}
{"text":"I came here with my girlfriend for my birthday and we got the Sev Puri, Bhuna Lamb, and Paneer Tikka Massala. Usually, I'm hesitant to go to an upscale restaurant that serves ethnic food because I find that the flavors are diluted, however this was not the case. Although we didn't enjoy the Sev Puri that much, both the Bhuna Lamb and the Paneer Tikka Massala were really good. The Lamb was extremely tender, and the cheese in the Paneer Tikka Massala was really dense which I liked. Just a note though, the mains do not come with rice or naan, so you'll have to order it separately. We got both the naan and the rice, and the naan was really good also. The waiter accidentally served my girlfriend the wrong dish, but at the end they comped us with Kheer which more than made up for it. I would definitely recommend getting the Kheer, I usually don't like rice pudding that much, but I really enjoyed this one. 

One thing that I didn't like though was that the service was kind of slow, it took 30-40 min for us to get served, and it looked like the people around us had to wait a similar amount of time."}
{"text":"A-OK pretty much sums up our experience at Bindia. 

Post Christmas Market, cold and hungry, we stumbled into Bindia after a few other restaurants on the strip rejected us because of lack of reservations. The hostess hemmed and hawed about letting us in, but eventually after a bit of a wait we did get a table - strangely enough it was the table that was empty pretty much since we got there.... 

The food at Bindia is decent! They have a large (but not overwhelming) menu, and while the prices are a bit higher than I'd like (I'm used to Brampton / suburban Indian pricing), overall I did enjoy my meal. Four of us split three mains (the palak paneer was great!), some garlic naan, and a few apps including their shrimp (which was quite good!). 

Here's an interesting fact I learned at Bindia - most Indian food is gluten free! So if you're stuck trying to figure out where to bring a GF friend, you'll have plenty of options at Bindia. They were very informed about what was GF which was very convenient!

We did get rushed out at the end of our dining experience, we lingered a bit too long and were asked to leave the table. While annoying, it was fair enough and they did offer us coupons for our next visit. Will that visit ever happen? I'm not convinced."}
{"text":"Although this restaurant is located in the convenient and trendy St. Lawrence Market area where foodie potential is at its max, sadly, this restaurant has definitely missed the mark. The service is very poor and excruciatingly slow. Prices are expensive - probably because of them wanting to capitalize on the downtown clientele.
I visited with group of 9 people and we waited over 2 hours for our food to be brought to our table and when it final arrived... all the dishes were cold! We sent the plates back and they were re-heated.
The recycled food was returned to us - the portions were small and the taste (on whatever dishes arrived semi-warm) was far from authentic."}
{"text":"Super delicious Indian food in Toronto. I was here many years ago, and the memorable meal I had then was matched by another memorable meal here tonight. 

Bindia is great for vegetarians, with lots of delicious options. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch for the first time.  The place was very comfortable with a very modern decor.  I got the tandoori chicken and my friend had the butter chicken.  Both dishes were very good.  Definitely will be coming back to try more dishes."}
{"text":"I fell sick after eating here. It's all show no quality. 
It seemed like a nice restaurant from outside and i wanted to give it a try since i was super hungry. And i have to give to them for the decor of the place. But i didn't go there to just enjoy the ambience.. I wanted some good Indian food. 

I ordered a chicken tikka masala and naan bread. It's probably the worst tasting chicken tikka masala i've ever had in my life. The sauce was plain out done with tomatoes and butter. I couldn't taste any spices or flavour. The garlic naan bread was dry and i think it was the flour that got me. I also ordered the lamb and it was plain out bland. Low on salt and the lamb of questionable quality. 

The service was okayish and it is highly priced for no reason. 

I would not recommend this place to anyone. 

There are much better choices in the city if you're looking for Indian food."}
{"text":"The restaurant was very loud and we left before ordering. It was a busy Friday evening and crowds were expected but this night was so loud we could not hear each other."}
{"text":"We've been here twice so far. The Pakoras are fantastic. Some of the best I've had in the city. The Bhindi (Okra) is very good, as is the Dal Makhni. I was only slightly disappointed with the Baingan Bhartha (eggplant). It tasted like they used frozen peas that were added late in the cooking process. While this preserves their texture, they were still cold inside. They also lacked the flavour of fresh peas. Only a minor quibble though, the food was otherwise fantastic. 

The main reason for the 4-star rating was the service, which was exceptional. Our server both times really took care of us. 

The décor is nice and modern."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  Samosas were greasy and bland. Butter chicken tasted like chicken in tomato paste. Nice decor and good service...but that's not enough to get me there again."}
{"text":"Good lunch menu options, portions are perfect sized.  Service was fantastic, and atmosphere is a good place to sit and chat for groups of 4-6 at lunch time even on Fridays.

Tried their butter chicken & naan, and a mango lassi. Naan is super fresh, and the lassi is lovely with cardamom bits and raspberry."}
{"text":"They are trying to be very fancy with the bistro bit, but the food was uninspired and just ok. Authentic Indian food? Absolutely not. Upmarket, contemporary or experimental Indian food? Nope. Just basic decent food, with basic items on the menu for it to be called Indian food--the usual suspects like butter chicken and chicken tikka masala. Absolutely nothing that I would pay this price for. I'd rather take my money and Indian food palette to 259 Host. This is a North Americanized version of Indian food, clean and neat place, everything tastes ok but not delicious.


I think I'll forever associate the word \"ok\" with this place because that's what comes to mind about the decor, service and every dish we ordered--meat samosas, chicken tikka masala, stuffed naan etc."}
{"text":"This small restaurant is just across the St Lawrence Market on Market Street. The décor is simple and elegant. The food is some of the best Indian food we ever had in Toronto: every dish is well presented and delicious.  We have yet to find something we don't like on the menu. The service is very efficient and friendly. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The best Indian food. The best decor I have ever seen for an Indian restaurant. Amazing service! And first and foremost for an indian restaurant, clean and modern washrooms (this is a major issue with any Indian restaurant and this one has better than 5 star restaurants). Kudos to you guys!

Food presentation amazing. Portions are right and taste is authentic. 

You won't go wrong here, go eat and enjoy the location."}
{"text":"This is a lovely modern place that serves lovely and mouth-watering plates at a perfectly reasonable price with good service and a full bar and a modest wine-by-the-glass list and a small draft beer list.

It's a bit off the beaten path, so make reservations and head on over!"}
{"text":"First time at Bindia, visiting Toronto from the states

I travel for business and try Indian restaurants in most cities I have visited- this is some of the best Indian food I have encountered 

Had the butter chicken and Palek paneer

Both had well balanced Rich spice mix, very flavorful without being heavy

Naan was lite and flavorful 

Punjabi classic cocktail was excellent mix of flavors and very unusual 

Great service and atmosphere 

Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Found this restaurant on yelp and decided to give it a try!  Food was fantastic.  Not to spicy and fresh ingredients.  My friend and I split everything so we ordered:
-meat samosas as an app 
-tandoori platter
-dal
-garlic naan
-basmati rice
Over all it was great but the portion sizes could have been a bit bigger. Wine list is limited and pricy.  Service was very attentive.  The chef even came over and asked how everything was.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on Saturday. The waitress was kind and quick. We ordered the poori and samosa for apetizers. The poori wasn't anything like the poori I usually get at other places. This was too light and crispy, nothing like a flatbread. There was cooked rice inside which made it a bit odd and sprinkled with some type of crispy grain. It was disapppinting because it was nothing like the poori we hoped to get. The samosa outter part was crispy and nice but inside it was potatoes and bland. 

For mains we ordered the butter chicken, chicken tikka masala, paneer tikka masala, chicken curry and chicken bruiyani and rice and butter naan bread for the sides. The butter chicken , butter naan and paneer tikka masala were the showstoppers. The chicken was very moist in the butter chicken and the sauce was creamy and delicious. The butter naan was really fluffy but small portion. The paneer tikka masala's sauce was very flavourful. The chicken curry was disapointing as it was tangy and not spicy at all maybe because my friend ordered it medium spice. The chicken bruiyani was disapppinting as the chicken was really dry. The yoghurt sauce that came with it was very fresh. 

For dessert we ordered masala teas for digestion and rasamalai. The rasamalai's presentation was really elegant with beautiful black berries on the side. The rasamalai was very yummy but we found for the price it was a small portion. All the dishes looked like they were small portions but they were filling as we had plenty to take back home! Also we had window seating with a beautiful view of the St. Lawrence market!"}
{"text":"Unbelievably good food with great vegetarian options. Literally everything our party tried blew us away.  Portion sizes are a bit small, especially considering the price, however, if you're going for really top notch flavor, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Bindia is right across the way from the St. Lawrence Market. There is an extensive vegetarian menu. Food was well prepared. Service was efficient. Prices are fair."}
{"text":"over priced, dirty plates, glass, and cutlery (we visited on a weekend late afternoon, 4:30ish). have to pay separate for rice and naan to go with the dish, which I have never encountered before. food tasted good, very flavorful. also, server was not bad. however, I'd not come again, for I've had the same quality food with such less $$ (and cleaner plates and cutlery)."}
