{"text":"Genius idea for a franchise.  No food and just focused on beer.  This is a great place to watch a game or just do some intense beer tasting with a small group.  The only thing preventing this location from a 5 star rating is the service.  If the place gets packed it can take a good while to get a drink but the service is always friendly and they are trained well to make solid recommendations on any beer you're thinking about trying.  Definitely work checking out."}
{"text":"Rather disappointed. Not by the beer selection...that is fantastic. But the service? Well now that was lacking. We sat down at one of the several open tables and it took about 10 minutes for the first waitress to tell us she'd be right back. About another 10 minutes pass and a second waitress brings is coasters. Eventually the first waitress came back and we finally ordered drinks; and that's where we stopped. Because at the pace of service here, we wouldn't get any food till next.   Maybe we'll try this again...but sheesh."}
{"text":"Came here expecting the worse just based on the average reviews for this place on yelp. And I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised. The staff were super helpful in recommending alternate beers and they even give you samples to make sure you'll like something. Even on a busy night, the staff still made it to our table and had time to talk and recommend beers and even do samples :) And for the friends at our table that didn't want to wait, which wasn't too long, just went to the bar and got service there fine.  Some nights are louder than others, depending on the amount of people and if there's a band, but every time I go back, the level of service hasn't changed and I always find more and more yummy beers. And I have to say, that some of the beers they offer here just don't taste the same at other places where they offer the same beer. I really like this place. And it's becoming one of the places that I like to go on a regular. I so need to go back and get like a service industry card!"}
{"text":"It's our first time here. It was good fast service and great food.  will definitely be back"}
{"text":"WOB is fabulous. Bartender are great, especially Anthony, Kenny, and Brittany. Best beer in Tempe. Quick serve. Now serves good which is awesome... Just like Anthony. Too many beers to choose from but the bartenders help you out. I will be here next Sunday! Every NFL game you could possibly want."}
{"text":"We have been wanting this place to be amazing...it's close to home and has a great concept....however service is never very good:( we asked for a beer that was listed on the iPad 2 people including an assistant manager said they did not have it yet someone behind the bar said if it's on the iPad we have it!  We ordered something else and of course they had it!  There was a pause when we asked the assistant manager to take back the beer we ordered to replace it with the one they originally said they did not have:( 2 more beers on the iPad and they did not have it:(  Also our party of 8 ordered and only 6 beers came to the table! If you are marketing yourself as a specialty beer spot your staff needs to have knowledge about the beers and you need to have up to date menus!"}
{"text":"Beer.  Such a deceptively simple concoction. A few earthy ingredients and a spry (if not gassy) fungus leads to this simple substance that we know and love. Who could have guessed that the world of beer (pun intended) could have so much depth and deliciousness? So many taps, SO many bottles, all just waiting to be tasted.   World of Beer celebrates its brew, stocking a huge selection from Asia to Europe and every corner of the US. From nitros to your lights and darks, there's always a great (and quickly rotating) selection on tap. As a local brew fan, I'm always impressed that a full third of their taps tout North Carolina and Charlotte products with frequent tap takeover nights that bring out unique kegs and casks.  And delivering the fine nectar into your waiting hands is an excellent staff that knows a humbling amount about beer. Don't know what you want? They can make a dozen recommendations and draft samples will flow. Test them out. From obscure European to seasonal locals, they are the gatekeepers into this wonderful world.   As with all good things, there is a cost. Your friends that you shouldn't have won't find $1 High Lifes here. There are plenty of nightly specials to keep one's wallet happy, but unique beers do come with a unique price. Should you bravely enroll in the WOB Loyalty Club, a competitive spirit may drive you to try way, way too many beers to reach milestones that will deliver to you a new wardrobe and glassware.   Go forth, explorer, and drink well."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday afternoon for some beer and food.  Great beer selection for sure.  The pricing is confusing though if you're ordering flights because some of the individual tasters are 1/3 of the full glass price and some are 1/2 the price.  We neglected to ask what the cost was for each individual tasters before ordering the flights and so when the bill came we were a bit taken back by the high cost.  Had I known some of the 5oz tasters cost more than $5 I would have just ordered a glass of something.  I think they should list the sample sized cost for each of the beers on the menu, that would have helped us make a better choice instead of leaving the place with a feeling of never wanting to return.  However, the food was ridiculously bad.  The caesar salad looked like someone just opened a prepackaged bag from the store and carelessly dumped it into a bowl while the flatbread pizza looked and tasted like something less desirable than a frozen Tombstone pizza. For the cost my expectations were a bit more high.  The service was really good and attentive though."}
{"text":"Are here yesterday with my husband and got food poisoning from the shrimp street tacos  The raspberry sour beer that I had was great however. Might try again, but not sure."}
{"text":"Worth a trip down University Ave - just bring a DD or cab it. Ridiculously good selection of beer!"}
{"text":"Best bar in town. Devin, Sara, and Pua make the best Bloody Mary's and Mojitis in town. Plus the local beer flights are an amazing way to sample the local craft brews. Why not order all three?!?! I do Everytime I come in."}
{"text":"Andrew has been a awesome server. I can't see how this place has anything less than 5 stars. Wish I could live here. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"World of beer is an epic fail on all fronts!  They act like they're the only place in the valley to drink craft beer...taste of tops and mellow mushroom are less than half a mile away and way better, service wise and ambiance!  Yeah they have a lot of beers but who really cares when the crowd is awful and you can barely get one beer in a 30 min time frame.  The place is too small and zero space to even exist with your overpriced beer!  Old chub is Damn 7 or 8 bucks, at taste of tops its 3 dollars for the same can, and on tap its 4...the pretenciousness at the place is overwhelming too!  Also, no one wants to hear awful live music and drink a dogfish head brew...cut the music out completely, open up the top level for customers, hire some bartenders with better personalities; it's like talking to stepford wives when ordering a beer, and just in general be better!  World of beer should be amazing, but instead it's beyond lame!  Loyalty card not worth it btw!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection!  The people are really nice and it's a great place to watch the football games on Sundays!"}
{"text":"Really love this place. Every Time I have come in here, Adam has been behind the bar. Super nice and knowledgable. Prices aren't too bad and huge variety!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were excited to hear about something like this in our area. Finally! First off, I have to say, our server Jeremiah was THE man! He knows his stuff... he walked us through the entire menu and pointed out his favorites along the way. We are both in the service industry so we know how hard it can be to know everything about a huge menu with tons of drink options. We were impressed by his knowledge of the menu and even more so by how incredibly kind he was. Food hit the spot and the beers were awesome, but the service we were given is what will keep us coming back. Head in and ask for Jeremiah and get the Bad Beat Hefe--it's local!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! They have over 600+ varieties of beer. They also have wine & alcohol for non beer drinkers as well. Although they don't have a kitchen in house you can order food from their 5 partnered local food spots that delivers!! I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a unique & fun atypical bar atmosphere! The music is fun too!"}
{"text":"Went here last night for the first time and had a great experience. The waiter was very helpful and knowledgeable about all the beers inquired about and gave thoughtful suggestions based upon what we were ordering. They do have a solid selection of beer which they do serve in the proper glassware which is nice. The pricing is a little higher than other places but is worth it for good service and good beer. Would definitely go again for a beer or two."}
{"text":"I waited a long time to come here. I remember seeing it on the news about a year or so ago and I'm the type to let the shine wear off, if you will, of a new business. Now that I have Friday afternoons free, I looked forward to my afternoon on Mill and my first visit to this hops oasis.   the selection by far exceeded my expectations. with AZ Beer Week in full swing, they had tap take overs of 3 different breweries. Of the 3 beers I had, 2 were ones that you couldn't get at your local Total Wine or grocery store.   My problem lays with the level of service. My bartender (Rachel on this Friday afternoon) poured a great Marble Reserve Ale. I even complimented her on it. Well, that was after about 10 minutes after she gave me the draught beer menu. And it only went down hill from there. I attempted to order food and request a bottle beer menu several times with no reciprocation. An assistant manager helped me out (Victor) after about 30 minutes of trying. Rachel knew her beer and how to pour it, but was lacking in the customer service portion. I counted only 8 people in the place while I was there; about 1 o'clock.   I am in the process of starting a beer tour business with this being one of the spots we would visit and I can't in good faith bring my clientele here if this is the level of attention that we would be receiving. I will be contacting you directly to discuss this opportunity.   If not for the selection, this experience would have received 1 star. Plus 2 for beer selection."}
{"text":"Great beer! Food is not the best. Worst service ever. Every time I go there the service is horrible! I even told the manager on duty that the reason why they are always empty is because of the poor service. ( if you only have 7 people at your bar, the service should be great!) 3 strikes and your out!"}
{"text":"The pretzel was bomb as it always is, the Chipotle chicken sandwich was actually real chicken and tasty, the beer list is always healthy. The only complaint was with the bratwurst; it was good but the girth and size of the brat resembled a prepubescent boy. All together I would return."}
{"text":"Seriously how can you not give 5 stars to a place with this many beers available? Good vibe and its on a corner so you can people watch. Perfect place to day drink on the weekend!!"}
{"text":"Staff is super friendly! Everyone said hello as they passed our table. The selection of beers is incredible and the food is tasty! Our server Jay was great in helping us pick out the perfect beer! We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Went there to watch the game today. Enjoyed the atmosphere, server was good, she checked on us often. Would go back again."}
{"text":"I don't think it is even worth for one star. I ordered drink, but I hadn't got anything for 20 minutes even a glass of water. Waiter who has big beard never paid  attention my husband's glass was empty for 10 mins. I never want to come back here anymore. Horrible service I've ever got! 5 or 4 star reviews? How much did this bar pay you guys to write? LOL."}
{"text":"First time I've been to this place. Overall I liked it. Previous reviews were pretty accurate. Very limited food menu and a great beer menu. The huge pretzel was really good and a lot different from the usual wings, etc.... The place is kind of small but I enjoyed it. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for three beers the other night, and the bartender decided to add a dollar to my charged tip (which was already at 20%). There's no excuse for this, and I refuse to return to an establishment that employs this class of scumbag."}
{"text":"I can't even give any info beyond the fact that we stood at the bar in open view of 3 bartenders for 10 + minutes and were never asked what we wanted."}
{"text":"I stopped by here for the first time yesterday simply because I was in the area.  Since it was a Tuesday, the crowd was small and I didn't have to deal with the college knuckle heads that pack this place on the weekends.  I was surprised that they did not serve food, but one of the bartenders said they allowed people to bring in their own food.  That may be ok if you want to grab a slice of pizza, maybe a hot dog or something else small and easy to carry from one of the nearby restaurant; but it seems like more of a hassle going from place to place just to find something to eat and carrying it back here.   The seating area is small and I couldn't imagine coming here on a Friday or Saturday night.  I get the feeling that on the weekends this place is just another Mill Avenue hot spot and the college locals consider it just another place to get tanked, only with a better selection of beer to do it with.    The bartender who served me was good, she offered up her personal favorites and recommended other beers based upon the IPA that I ordered and even gave samples without me having to ask for one.    So if you have some free time during the weekday and want the opportunity to sample a good variety of beers, then I'd recommend giving WoB a shot.  However, I wouldn't want to chance this place on a weekend.  The crowds, combined with the already small interior wouldn't allow you the opportunity to truly enjoy all the different styles of beer they have."}
{"text":"A great venue, lovely atmosphere, amazing beer selection and great staff.   Chrissy, you ROCK! Cape Town, South Africa, loves you."}
{"text":"I absolutely love beer, so obviously I loved having 600 different choices! However with all the choices it took me like 20 minutes to decide which beer I wanted but my bartender was so nice about it. I think her name was Britney, all I remember is that she had a half sleeve on her forearm. Any way, she was so nice about getting me samples and giving me information about different beers I might like! She even made me a drink called a chocolate chip cookie, sooooo good! I am defiantly bringing my friends who don't like beer to this place because that drink was just delicious!  Overall I loved the bar, beer was great, Britney was great, but the prices were a little high. I don't understand how they could be busy especially right next to ASU, but she did tell me they have specials a few nights a week so maybe that's how. But anyway, it's a good place to check out!"}
{"text":"First time visiting Tempe, and first time visiting WOB. After bouncing through a couple other bars on Mill Avenue, I landed at WOB. I must say, the staff and atmosphere made me feel much more comfortable than my earlier journeys that evening. I wouldn't call myself a beer enthusiast, but after our server brought us a flight of various samples, I was hooked! The atmosphere was GREAT, live music and a friendly crowd. I didn't realize the endless possibilities, and at first I was a bit overwhelmed. However, our server (who was extremely knowledgable on beer) pointed us in the right direction!  Highly recommend this place if your looking to have some fun on a night out,"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I have been looking forward to going to World of Beer in Middleton for some time. We finally made it out today, but we won't be returning. I can't review the food OR beer because we never got the chance to try either. I can only review the non-existent service from the two employees. We sat down at a high top table, the restaurant was about half-full mind you. After 5-10 minutes of wondering if we should just go straight to the bar for a menu we finally had someone drop off menus and walk away. No \"hello\" or anything. We were ready to order drinks and food within a few minutes and watched the disinterested waiter go to the table next to us three times without returning to our table. We waited for 15 minutes after receiving menus, not getting the chance to even order we walked out. It was pretty pathetic to say the least. If you go be prepared to wait 20+ minutes to order a beer when it's not even busy by someone who is clearly wishing they were anywhere but World of Beer."}
{"text":"This is a great place to try new drinks. Easily one of the most impressive beer menus in the Charlotte area along with plenty of nice seating. It's surprisingly is not extremely loud and the bathrooms are kept rather clean.  The biggest draw back is that they don't server any kind of food, however this is offset by the fact they let you bring food from other places and even will provide you with menus from some of the local eateries. There's not really any games (pool, darts, etc) and few TV's,.  They had a band play on their opening night, however I have yet to see another show their. Being pretty new, it seems there still forming their \"usual crowd\". I enjoy stopping in here from time to time and trying something new."}
{"text":"This place is ok Service is terrible  Our server maybe came to the table twice while were there 2 hours  Had to get up & go to bar to get drinks  Margarita was terrible-super sour  Pretzel was great though so if u want to grab a beer & pretzel then maybe??"}
{"text":"Been here 3x before I would review. Same experience each time. Little interest in you unless you plan to chug some brew. Not a place for a serious diner or just a casual sipper. Dont expect much bartender conversation either. Save your $, go around the corner and build a 6 pack at Total Wine. Go home, flip a cap and enjoy around your firepit. Save $. Be comfortable and have more fun elsewhere. World of Beer will only be good for a brief stop before the real destination."}
{"text":"Went here the last night of the DNC. Seemed like a cool place but only stayed for a drink after they shut off the DNC telecast (which was happening less than a mile away) because of complaints from a select few.  Apparently shitty music takes precedent over current and LOCAL events.  Only been here once,  but on this night they definitely pandered to a certain kind of crowd....use your imagination.   I took my business to Growlers in Noda instead.  That said, WOB had a ton of good beer on tap and in the fridges plus reasonable prices....just wish they wouldn't have caved to those complaining."}
{"text":"I've been back several times since my initial review and I think my principle complaint about staff has been resolved.  The new staff are much better and overall the place seems better run.  I will never be a huge fan of this bar because I think it is somewhat overpriced and I don't like the atmosphere (can't be helped due to its location), but the selection is always interesting and I don't hate coming in."}
{"text":"If you love trying different style beers with a knowledgeable staff this is the place to go. I drove from Arizona to enjoy my favorite beer since I can't get it in my small town. Not only did I get to enjoy my favorite beer but was also recommended other beers that were delicious. The service was amazing! We actually drove back from Arizona the next day because we had such a good time. We were served by Andrew and he was amazing. He has an amazing personality and made us feel welcomed. It's hard to find servers and bartenders that you can joke back and forth with. As a server myself I know the stress of the job and how important it is to keep your customers happy and Andrew did more than that for us. We will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"This review is bordering on 3 stars, but it didn't quite make it.  They have beer, but this feels more like a retail shop than a bar. I went on a weekday, after 1am. Maybe that had something to do with the lackluster experience.  The music was incredibly loud for the small handful of people inside the place.  It's new, modern, whatever you want to call it. It has a sterile feel, not very comfortable.   This place has an enormous beer selection. That is all it has going for it. They do not serve food. I know you can have food delivered from other local places, but if those places aren't open, then you have no dining option.  I would go back if a friend wanted to go to try out some interesting beers, but I've been there, seen it, don't need to repeat it."}
{"text":"Welcome to Lakewood, World of Beer! What a beautiful use of an unused space in the heart of downtown Lakewood.  I went there last night after dinner, with my family, to catch a little bit of the Tribe opener.  We were thrilled to see the game on tons of tvs, visible from pretty much anywhere in the joint.  We were greeted by the manager, Shawn, before we even got to our table.  We started talking about how my mom isn't much of a beer drinker, and he went ABOVE and BEYOND by bringing her four little samples of things that he thought she might like, based upon what she told him. I was ultra impressed and, sure enough, she really liked one of his recommendations!  The place looked great and I am looking forward to going back to see some live music in the near future.  Our service was great, which I totally didn't expect, since the place has only been open for like a week!  Really refreshing to see something other than a smelly \"bud light and shot\" place in Lakewood."}
{"text":"Manager was walking around barking at his employees like a real asshole. The servers were doing their best but he seemed to have a problem with everything. Maybe try talk to your employees respectfully."}
{"text":"Seemed like beer beginners.  And the tax added is nonsense.  Nothing really special if you've any beer knowledge."}
{"text":"The menu and website both say they have wine, but they don't at this location. Apparently they use the same menu in all of their restaurants and the locations in Florida have wine, but not here in Charlotte. My recommendation is to just take the pages out of the menu and off the website."}
{"text":"Well, I have mixed reviews about this place! First of all, they have an amazing beer selection! I have only been to one other place that rivals world of beer as far as selection goes. The atmosphere inside the bar was nice, great tv's and a comfortable feel! Can't wait till they open up the seating section upstairs. It was very busy today , but my guess is because it was due to NFL pre-season starting!  Now the bad! The patio could use a few free standing bistro tables so people have a place to put there beers while having a smoke or socializing outside! As far as inside the bar goes, my only complaint was with the bar staff. Now I realize that it was very busy when I got there, but I was lucky enough to grab a seat at the bar fairly quick, I sat for almost 15 min before someone helped me! I think I counted at least 12 people working behind the bar. With a bar that size there is no reason with that many bartenders and bar backs it should take that long for service, some were playing on there phones, others looked like they were socializing with friends, and a couple bartenders just looked lost! I understand this place is relatively newer and it's going to take some time to work out the kinks! But witnessing a bartender use his pinky as a toothpick and then serve people a beer, with fruit in it, without washing his hands is just unacceptable! And last thing is uniform! Everyone had a world of beer shirt but some people had jeans, khakis, leopard print skirts, per the word \"uniform\" they failed.Having experience in this industry from a management standpoint I see a lot of things that need to be adjusted! I'll give it a month or two and then stop back in."}
{"text":"Sit at the bar for better service.  Marie had a sense of urgency i hadn't experienced in previous visits.  Good recommendations too."}
{"text":"I had heard about this place from a buddy of mine and decided to stop in. I can't see myself becoming a regular but it was certainly worth the visit. They have an amazing selection, lots on tap. The atmosphere was relaxing without being dead, something that I appreciate. I especially like their rotating taps.  Worst case scenario, if you don't like the place you're still bound to find some good beer."}
{"text":"huge selection of beers. friendly staff. large wrap around bar. supersized pretzel. come and check it out yourself!"}
{"text":"On the bright side, the beer selection is fantastic. They've got all kinds of interesting beer; some I'd never even seen in stores. If trying new beers is something you enjoy, give this place a shot. I hope they acknowledge that you're a human or at least that you're there.  The \"service\" here is abhorrent at best and really drives [down] my review. I was ready to leave after waiting for in excess of 10 minutes to even be acknowledged by either of the bartenders. Once he finally arrived, he had the personality of a wet dishrag and didn't seem to give a damn about us in any way. You want your check? So what. Drinks empty? So what. I'd say the bar was around 30% capacity during our visit. Not slammed but not dead either."}
{"text":"If you're a beer lover, this is the place for you.  The selection is the best I've seen in the Cleveland area: perhaps thirty taps (I didn't bother to count), and multiple hundreds of bottles.  I was amazed by the service.  When I go out to a bar on a Friday evening, I generally expect to have a bad time, service-wise.  Not here.  We were able to quickly get seats, and our waitress was great.  She got us our beers very quickly, and she was very accommodating when some of my friends were indecisive.  As is typical for a full bar, it was loud, but fortunately I never had to strain to hear conversation at my table.  When we wanted to order food, our waitress provided us with a book of menu from a bunch of the nearby eateries.  We ordered from the Eddie and Eddie's waitress who was roving through.  I think it's a plus that WOB has chosen to specialize: they can provide a larger variety of beer, and the customers get the advantage of more choices for food.  It seemed like the local food joints were also happy for the business, and their delivery service was faster than the table service at many other bars I've been to.  Is it cheap? YES.  Is it pricey? YES.  Wait, what?  For the giant selection of domestic and foreign beers, you are getting a very good price.  You have the opportunity to sample hundreds of brews, many of which aren't even available at your favorite specialty beer retailer.  However, if you go here expecting to pay the same amount as you pay for Bud, Miller, Coors, Yuengling or even GLBC Dortmunder at your local bar, World of Beer isn't for you.  You have more options here, and many of the beers here are far more resource-intensive (both in ingredients, labor, transportation, and stocking) than others.  Was it worth it?  Yes, it was."}
{"text":"Only reason I am giving 1 star is because the beer was good, worst food and portion size I have ever had at any restaurant. I had a $12.50 Chimay burger it came with 6 French fries and a pickle, the burger had no seasoning. It tasted like plain overdone chop meat.  Go to lazy dog 10000% better."}
{"text":"They have a chill corner area with couches, coffee table, and even Nintendo you can play. Cool corner area to hang out, BUT they HAVE to replace the couch and chairs in this area. They are really worn and sinking into the ground. Cool concept, but it's hard to relax in these really uncomfortable worn out chairs. Replace the seats and you've got a winner."}
{"text":"I came across this place one night after dining at the establishment next door... I came in on a Friday night place wasnt packed. My friend and I sat at a booth. The beer list is pretty extensive. It took 15 mins before we were acknowledged. This place seems very unorganized or the staff has not been properly trained. Our server was quite short and borderline rude. We both had a beer each and shared some appetizers. The food was good slightly better than the service. I don't think I'll be returning"}
{"text":"For a first impression, the staff did a terrible job convincing me to come back! The service was horrific, having to wait 40 min just to get a beer and another 30 min for our food. The couple next to its got up and left after having sat there for 20 min without a single visit from the wait staff.  I will not be back with so many other better places to drink and eat in the area!"}
{"text":"cool place with plenty of beer choices.  service wasn't a highlight.  guy with dark curly hair needs to rethink the service industry."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out on fridays after work. Great beer selection on both bottle and tap.   However it's a pain to find a parking spot in the vicinity .   And the place does not serve any food ! Luckily, one can order food from the neighboring restaurants (ordering extra makes sense- multiple orders kill the mood) . Seems the management does not want to distract the patrons from beer."}
{"text":"WOB is always rotating new and fun beers on tap. Service is fun and enjoyable. The staff makes this place. Love hanging out here!"}
{"text":"Awesome, that's all I can say! Staff is great beer it's great, very knowledgeable and eager to help you decide what you like and taste to find your favorites. Haven't ate their yet but I've heard the giant pretzel is a must."}
{"text":"Great pub style place to go and relax while sampling 500 different beers on tap or in bottles. My wife and I have always had great service and the staff have been very friendly to us.  It is first come first serve with seating which I don't have a problem with. Always have found a place to sit or have shared a table with other people there which a great way to meet new people and have fun!   Bottom line, great place to enjoy a large selection of beers, great appetizers and a fun cozy pub style bar!!   We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Cool place and having the food delivered to the bar is a good concept. There is always a foul smell though and the acoustics are terrible when they have live music."}
{"text":"WOB in Tempe was awesome!!! I really am not a big beer drinker. (drink of choice is the Appletini) but I came to world of beer with a friend and didn't feel right not ordering a beer. Being world of beer, you'd think the staff would be knowledgeable of beer.... Which they were!!! We has a young lady names Mary? Margaret? Margarine? Regardless, she was great. She was kind with all of my questions, we finally settled on the elderberry cider. Not a beer, but close! Loved the experience at W.O.B.   Thank you Margarine and all of the staff at W.O.B."}
{"text":"I have been to World of Beer a few times since it has opened and I must say I have not had a bad experience yet. The servers are polite and the beer is delicious. Yes, it is a small venue but there is nothing you can do about it and it does get slammed on the weekends, but this is to be expected since it is brand new.   Every time my friends and I go we look for Kenny or Ashley, they have been helpful and courteous and they make us feel at home. I would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys craft beer although you do need to be a bit patient when they are busy."}
{"text":"We visited on a Saturday night and there was only 1 server working and the entire place was packed. I kept having to go to the bar to get refills on our drinks. There appeared to be another 'server' there but she was bouncing between flirting with guys at the bar and playing giant Jenga. The food was subpar and the music was so loud we couldn't even have a conversation. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"They had a sign out front and a picture of the sign on their FB page that read: \"For every $50 spent receive a $10 gift card until the end of the year.\" I spent $53 and did not get a $10 gift card. Also, after I inquired about the gift card the picture of the sign was deleted from their FB page. I snapped a photo of it though. The manager, Baktash, is a jerk. Get beers somewhere else. This place sucks."}
{"text":"We don't normally review restaurants. But world of beer had been consistently exceptional. It has become our go-to spot for great food and drinks. They have an impressive beer list which my husband enjoys. They also have a full bar/ very good mixed drinks. The restaurant is much larger than it appears from the parking lot, and they have a nice private patio for those summer nights. A few of our favorites: shrimp street tacos (most try!), buffalo wings, German pretzel, flatbread pizzas."}
{"text":"very nice staff.  I decided to get a late lunch at chipotle...then I thought, I should drop over to get a quick beer. so I bring my chipotle over, got a beer and decided since it's 2pm, no crowds, I'll just sit at WOB patio to eat my chipotle...  most restaurants have a no outside food/beverage policy, I get that totally  The Bartender was kind enough to tell me they have that policy, but that he won't enforce it this time. He could have decided to tell me to leave, but took the gentleman's road, so I can appreciate that. thanks WOB staff for being courteous"}
{"text":"I found this bar in Henderson that is a must ! I was on the internet and saw world of beer and I'm so happy I came. Sarah has the best customer service of any bartender I have ever come cross. Her knowledge of the beers they have on tap and in cooler was amazing.(they have over 100 beers). I will 100% be coming back here every week!  Service 5/5 Food 5/5  Bar decor 5/5"}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place a better review but there are some major flaws. First off this place is way too small to handle the amount of people that come in, Many people are left just standing and trying to cram themselves. This would not be a good place for someone who is claustrophobic. Once you get past that the beer selection is good and our bartender was good. Next gripe, this place does not serve any sort of food, they say you can order food and have it delivered which seems like the weirdest concept I've heard in my yelping days. At that point you're better off picking up your favorite brew at bevmo or going somewhere that does serve food. Overall try it out and you might like it, for me I doubt I will be back."}
{"text":"Amazing employees and manager!! Food was great!! Pretzel and cheese was off the hook!!!"}
{"text":"Awful service. The beer selection is great, but I was empty on beer for about 20mins. I tried multiple times getting the bartenders attention. It wasn't until I was about ready to walk out that I got attention. Hell, the bartenders thought I paid already. Anyways, horrible service which left me to leave a $0 tip. Tessa was our server according to the reciept. Place should be closed down anyways for scaming a local charity."}
{"text":"OK, Start with the good. I have visited this place 3 times. Last time was sat 2/15 late afternoon. The patio was full and the inside was about 3/4 full. Nice crowd on a beautiful sat afternoon. Sat at inside bar but open front makes it feel not so indoors. Service was quick and friendly. Beer selection is exceptional. Very diverse on both the handles and the bottle selection. Prices are very reasonable for the quality of beer available with plenty to choose from in the $4-$6 range. The so-so. Food selection is limited. If you're hungry this place might be a disappointment. Its more of an appetizer menu of beer pairing fare. Pretzels, brat sliders and loaded tots to name a few. Having said that, if you're thirsty and want a snack to go with your beers, you're golden. The patio is also kind of small. All in all I really enjoy this place and its nice to see some more places like this coming to the SE valley. If you are close by or just need a beer to wind down from a hard day of shopping WoB is definitely worth stopping for."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a large selection of beer, draught and bottle, go for it. They have an extensive list, frankly, almost too big.  If you are looking for good service or even just okay food, avoid this place. I'm fairly certain a grilled cheese should probably be crispy, even just a little. Waiting twenty minutes to get plates cleared, when there are at least six staff members standing around, also not in the realm of good.  Let me add one more thing. I went there to play trivia. I thought the idea was to keep people there. The guy running it must have had a hot date tonight. He ran it like it was speed trivia. Normally, a host will ask the question, then play a song. In twenty questions not one time did a song finish playing.   In all, an exceptionally poor experience. It only gets the second star for it's vast beer selection."}
{"text":"World of beer, Says it all. Notice they dont say that they are a restaurant as they have no food, they are going for one thing. Awesome beers on tap and lots of them. Proper glassware and washing techniques. Very knowledgeable staff trained very well. Nice atmosphere with a long bar surrounded by pub tables and a cool hangout up top. If you truly enjoy intense beer then this is the place for you. Just make sure you dont arrive on an empty stomach."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. I live right down the street from it and come to this place about every time I go out on Mill for drinks. I would give it 5 stars.... but I can't because of the horrible live band(s) that play there. I can't tell if it's always the same band or multiple bands, but every friday night of live music is equally as bad. I'm sure this band is good for people in small doses, but it's tough for me and my friends to handle on a weekly basis."}
{"text":"Strangely snobby bartenders considering that they work at the mall. Great beer selection and excellent food. Service is Terrible (with a capital T). Five total visits."}
{"text":"Go ahead and come down this World of Beer. You won't regret it. Although the pricing is not so cheap, you are paying for a world class selection of beers from around the world as the title states. If you are lucky enough to sit on the patio at sunset, while drinking your beer/cocktail...well then you are about the luckiest person on the planet. Right then and there you will be grateful to be alive. Just remember to stay in the moment although the alcohol should help with that."}
{"text":"Phenomenal beer (and cider!) selection. However, you are constantly asked by the bartender if you know what you want if you have not yet ordered your first beer. After you decide on said beer with little to no help, you're scoffed at if the beer you order isn't unique or expensive enough for the totally cool bartenders taste. You wait five minutes for this all while feeling like an a-hole because that's how the bartender made you feel.   Fast forward $90 later between two people. You're sober. Yes, I realize the goal isn't to get plastered, but who doesn't love a nice buzz every now and again?! And at $45/each, I better be buzzing pretty gosh darn good. For $90 you're better off buying a crap ton of PBR (because the goal is to be kewl and totes trendy, right?!,) and staying home with a few buddies. Even after paying out an astronomical tab for less than 8 beers, again, between two people plus a hefty tip, we still felt an air from our now server since the bartender didn't want anything to do with us.   All in all, if you want to be hip and grab a beer you've never heard of and hate yourself for ordering with every sip, go here. If you want to go to Melt with out the wait and want to Frogger across the street to get it, go here. If you want to spend a small fortune for a large disappointment, go here.   Obviously I won't be back. Drink responsibly and stay thirsty my friends. Trust me, you'll still be thirsty when you leave here."}
{"text":"We absolutely enjoyed our first visit , we were invited for a meet n greet for singles arranged by Zanthi Zembillas, we had an amazing time. The choices in Drafts were outstanding great place for an evening of fun and friendly staff and Miss\"Z\" is was quite the gal...I am so glad we were invited to World of Beer, we never knew..We will definitely be back and spread the word."}
{"text":"I work in the close area and visit many of the bars around Mill Ave, this by far is one of best. You get a more mature bar in the heart of Tempe, and if you're a craft brew fan, you'll be content. The great selection of beers both on draught and in bottle is sure to please everyone's tastes. The staff consists of great people, both very knowledgable and very personable/friendly.  I can not recommend World of Beer enough if you're a craft brew fan who doesn't want the typical college \"party scene\"."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to come eat and drink. I've had great service every time. Clean bathrooms, and overall a very awesome place. Would recommend 10/10."}
{"text":"Unbelievable. Sure they CAN place tax ON TOP of the beer price, although that doesn't seem wise from a presentation standpoint. But when you order a beer, then pay cash for it ($4.37 in total, I gave her a $10), and the server brings you back five dollars....wait a second, there was a simple mistake. She short changed me by accident... Then you ask about the remaining 63 cents in change, joking, laughing at was clearly a simple and honest mistake on her part... \"We don't carry change\" she says. Excuse me, is this a joke? Nope, not at WOB, and not only that, they round in their favor. I think most people would call that theft. So you ask for the manager, question him on the policy, never raise your voice, use no profanity and certainly never threaten him...then he says he'll have security escort you out because you are upset. OH MY GOD! He said they were not obligated to give exact change. What The!?  So I talk to corporate, they fall all over themselves to apologize and send me a $25 comp, but I told them I'm never coming back and they needed to know why. I work in the industry, and have forever. I'd lose my job, and rightly so, if I ever treated a guest this way, and I'd never work with a place that has this kind of mind set. This is all fact, this actually happened exactly as described, its not sci fi or fantasy, it is not opinion or interpretation. It just blew me away. With all that Mill Ave has to offer, WOB is a stain in the area and does not deserve anyone's patronage."}
{"text":"I always get great service and great drinks here. Yes, some of the drinks are pricey, but worth it. If you want a cheap drink, order a crappy Budweiser. But if you want good, craft (and local!) beer, you are going to have to pay a little more.  I always order food from Eddie Cerino's Casual Italian next door and service is great. They bring it right over to you. I've never had bad service at this bar and I always have a nice, relaxing time."}
{"text":"We were just there to get drinks after work. It was 10 pm and we just arrived for the late happy hour. We sat outside where another couple was. We had 3, not 1, but 3 servers walk right past us and not say a word. Absolutely horrible! Then one male server came out to say something to the other table outside but didn't even look our way or acknowledge us. We were sitting there for 15 min with no one approaching us. Terrible service! And we know a ton of people in the industry around this area and we will be sharing our experience to them as well. Hopefully you get better employees who actually care about customer service!"}
{"text":"I dunno, but two employees (cooks) just started fighting. I think one guys name was fletcher. Anyway, one of the cooks got hit twice and slammed up against a cabinet. Once the poor guy broke free, he ran behind the bar for cover. The other guy (who had a large beard) called the guy behind the bar a \"punk bitch\", then stormed out of the establishment. If you ask me, the aggressor is a threat to this establishment and should loose his job. Just think if this guy gets angry at a customer. Not to mention, the manager was nowhere to be found. Bottom line...good place to drink beer and socialize, but employees should not be fighting."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food and great beer selection. The giant pretzel and the Black & Blue flatbread are my faves!"}
{"text":"If only I could give ZERO STARS... ignored at the entrance while no less than three employees made eye contact at us. Sat ourselves and ignored some more. Saw 5 employees sitting and chatting with eachother in the corner. Moved to the bar...at least she was busy doing work...got up and got menus myself at the host stand. While I was walking back the waitress flopped menus down in a huff in front of us after we got our own. We left...goodbye 60 dollar tab!"}
{"text":"Great draft beer selection that changes from time to time.  The ambiance is welcoming with a great patio.  The food is really good, but the selection is limited.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money.  Beer is overpriced and TAXED.   They do have a large selection of beer, but no liquor. Manager was a dick, bartenders were nice. Ran out of their cheapest beer by 10 pm. Music was good"}
{"text":"If you come here to just drink beer, it's fine. But if you want some food to go along with your beer, go somewhere else. The food is mediocre at best. Fries were soggy and undercooked, flatbreads were incredibly underwhelming and the brat sliders were pretty tasteless. The service was also very slow despite the place not being very busy. We will not come back. There are far better places with as good or better beer selections."}
{"text":"Not what I expected. That is how I would describe World of Beer.  Just like WOB, I'm new to Tempe, so I wanted to see what all the hype was about. From its name I would defer that this world of beer was a casual establishment that put great pride in the variety of fancy, imported, non-U.S. made drafts. Kind of like a swanky wine bar but for beer. I was NOT expecting it to be so welcoming to the Friday/saturday crowd that Mill attracts. I thought it was going to take a more settled down vibe and boost in its sosphictacted-ness whilst the young-ins sip cheap vodka and Bud Lights at the clubs.  But no! This place was poppin' on a Friday night on Mill. I went for a a little pre-club drink and it was packed wall to wall. The bouncers almost didn't let me in because my I.D. is from MO which was an odd, but minor issue. The bigger issue was being able to hear yourself over the crowd. If you couldn't listen to the person next to you talk, no worries you were being otherwise entertained by the delightfully fun live band playing above the bar. The atmosphere was so chill and hip and welcoming to the average 20-something, much different from the stuffy, stuck-up vibe I was expecting.   Gotta pay major props to WOB for hosting such an awesome crowd while serving such an insane variety of beverage choices. I think it's pretty cool that a college bar enviroment now has somewhere where you can get a well-made, imported beer and not drink $4 well drunks made with $2 vodka. It's nice to be able to act and dress in the same attire as Que or Robby Fox's but enjoy a more mature drink and way cooler atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came here on the recommendation of a friend. The name says it all! There is a beer in this place to make everyone happy. The food is killer & the staff is really nice. I'll be back to get my member card stamped as often as I can!"}
{"text":"Amazing service! Both Ted and Dan were the funniest bartenders we've ever encountered! Definitely loved how they bounced off each other! Amazing suggestions and great beer! Can't wait to come again!"}
{"text":"Would have liked to have had a few appetizers. Also disappointed that the beer glasses weren't cold. It has a lot of potential."}
{"text":"Honestly, I wasn't even a fan of beer before this place (yeah yeah yeah... What can I say, I love my hard liquor). All the bartenders are knowledgeable and helped me discover my favorite beer. They even let me sample some before I committed to the one.  Great service, convenient location, quick service, knowledgable staff, affordable prices for craft beers, and a overall sexy staff (has no effect on my beer, but great candy for my eyes).  Check this place out with your friends! My recommendation would be to be adventurous and try to discovery a new beer and don't be afraid to ask the staff tons of questions like I did!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Was expensive even with \"half off.\" Had a lot of beers, first two picks were out though. Bartender seemed rushed to finish with me. If you're looking to try hundreds of beer on tap this is the place for you, just make sure to bring a lot of money."}
{"text":"First time in this WoB. From 9 attempts, 8 beers were sold out. Finally I found a beer from Poland which was in stock. I asked the bartender to see the bottle and later I realized the best before date was expired. (I told the server that it was expired, but no reaction from her)  After drinking 3/4 of the beer (1 hour later), I felt very bad in my stomach and asked for water and a slice of bread. I got my water, but the server said that she would have to charge me for bread. So I took the cab back and my friends continued partying that night.   We all ate 6 hours ago the same kind of sub at subway and I was the only one feeling very bad.   I'm German, so I am sorry for my non native English."}
{"text":"I was in Mesa during baseball spring training in March. My girlfriend and I decided to stop at The World of Beer for a drink and some food. They do not make or serve food there, it is just a bar no grill. They have a wonderful selection of beers and the service was good. The waitress was friendly and checked in on us several times. They also have a delivery menu from restaraunts in the area who will deliver food to the bar. Pretty Cool. We did ask if they could turn one of the many TV's to a game that we wanted to watch. The waitress said she couldn't because the manager was the only one who knew how to do it and he was \"TOO BUSY\".   That kind of turned me off. I would have otherwise given the place 5 stars for selection. What ever happened to the notion of going out of your way to make a customer happy who is spending a lot of money at your business. I guess it is gone by the wayside."}
{"text":"Our visit to WOB was underwhelming to say the least.  We visited around lunch time when we were 1 of just a few small groups of people.  To begin with, when we walked in the door, we were not greeted and were not even sure if we should just seat ourselves or wait for a hostess; we finally decided to just seat ourselves.  Our waitress was a major disappointment. She seemed completely uninterested in waiting on us.  She  reluctantly recommended a beer to my wife for her meal only to come back 10 minutes later to tell her it was no longer available. It seems to me that if you are going to recommend a particular beer, you  should know if it is available.  After our food was delivered to our table our waitress also never bothered to check back on how our meal tasted or if we needed anything else.  My wife would have liked to have some salt(none on the table), but since she never came back we did without it.  Finally, there were many flies circling around/landing on us and our food that made the experience very unpleasant."}
{"text":"Place was great. We went over here to pass the time waiting for table at Melt Bar and Grill across the street. Great atmosphere. Rediculous selection of beers (of course) and good service. I thought it was interesting that they don't serve food, but I like the idea. Our waitress told us that we were welcome to have food delivered if we wanted. I like the concept. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Extremely underwhelming. Poor service. No knowledge of beers. But maybe you don't need knowledge when you have a descriptive menu.   Our food came out thirty minutes apart. My steak sandwich was more like a single slice of SteakUm on undercooked bread. Definitely not with the seventy five minute wait from order.   My wife asked multiple times for a beer sample and finally ended with a full beer. What was disappointing  is that for a place specializing in beer the draughts were too warm and a few of the beers were flat.   We did think the sausage platter was pretty good.   They did have a great selection of beer and seems like a fun place, but was disappointing."}
{"text":"Since my review, I've been informed that WoB has different glassware for different pours.  So the specific glass I was served in was a 12-oz glass, intended for cans or bottles, not their normal pint glass.  I haven't confirmed this, but it seems reasonable, so I stand corrected.  However, I will take this chance to comment on the fact that the prices at WoB start at $5.00 per pint, which although not unreasonable (especially for Mill Ave), can be improved upon at many other craft-beer specialty bars in the area.  (On the day I was at WoB, I had a Deschutes Green Lakes Organic Ale pint for $3.50 at Boulders on Broadway).  And one last thing that annoyed me that I didn't note in my original review was the \"shot\" of beer I had.  The menu mentions that shots of beer (what is known as \"samplers\" in most every other craft brew bar or brewpub) are $2-$5 (charging $5 for any shot makes no sense at all).  I had a beer that costs $6.00 per pint and I was charged $3 for a \"shot\" of the beer.  This is completely unreasonable.  I recommend that if you decide to go with \"shots\" of beer, stick with only the cheapest beers on the menu, so you pay only $2 per shot.  These issues, in addition to the strange vibe and the ill-informed wait staff, keep my review at 2 stars.  There is simply MUCH better options to sample good craft beer in Tempe (e.g., Boulders, Taste of Tops)"}
{"text":"They have East Coast beers (for me - other coasts for everyone else!), nice bartenders, TVs with sports, good music, comfortable seating, a corner spot with a patio perfect for people watching and cig smoking, an age appropriate crowd (I'm 25 and I don't feel too old to be there), and generally clean toilets in working condition. Basically everything I could possibly want or need out of a bar to drink beer at with my friends. I love WOB!!!"}
{"text":"Prices are STUPID. God forbid you order a Sam Adams Double Agent Seasonal beer - it's $7.00. Yes. $7 for one pint of a beer that is $8.00 for a six pack at any store. Total bullshit."}
{"text":"Taylor was my server. She was super sweet and attentive. I bring my dog with me and she gets him water. They have delirium tremens yummy yummy. Great local spot to chill and get work done or chat w/friends"}
{"text":"I love their beer selection. Lots of drafts and bottles. However, I was a little disappointed at the Oktoberfest selections. I think there was only 1 on the draft menu, and it wasn't anything special, Saranac or Sam Adams.  I would rate higher, but sometimes the services is a little slow.  I'll keep going back though. Great place to stop by for a beer on the way home from work."}
{"text":"I don't know why I keep trying this place. Employees apparently hate working here. I don't know how long it took to serve us, just gave us menus without a high or something - don't even care to see that we are displeased. Poor franchise owner who invests but has their people run it to the ground. What a shame - mill location so much better managed."}
{"text":"First time eating here. Will be the last. Waited 10 mins to get just the attention of a waitress. Then 5 more mins to get her back to take our drink order. Food is by far great. I had (1) biscuit with (2) strips of way over cooked bacon and (2) eggs on top. $10.00 and was cold when received it. Oh not to mention the tatter tots that where half cooked. Better to go over to PT Pub and get a real breakfast for the same price. Won't be back."}
{"text":"More like World of Tears! I've been here three times now and finally I have learned my lesson. Though they offer a great selection of bottles and drafts, the service is absolutely awful. The first time I went, the waitress clearly did not know anything about the beer. The second time, the waitress again did not know anything about the beers. The third time, I knew better to ask about any beers (probably wasn't going to get much help). I did go to watch basketball (since there are about 50 million TVs in the place). I had to ask 3 times to change a TV to one of the games. The first two waiters listened to my request and then proceeded to DO NOTHING and then finally, the third time, a young woman got another server to change the TV. But he changed it to the non-HD version, so I might as well have watched the game from across the street. I feel like most people would have still thought the experience was great, but unlike them, I'm not mesmerized by boobs. I like when people know about the products they are serving and acknowledge their guests."}
{"text":"Service was outstanding last night with Jayson as our server. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Where do I start!!, came here for my first time on Sunday, decided to go sit at the bar and met the bartender Sarah. She was amazing, super knowledgeable and friendly. I must of asked about 10 different beers and styles and not once did she fail me, I was impressed with every one of them, and ohhhh man the food was legit, I had the German pretzel with this super savory beer cheese sauce that I could legit put on everything!! all in all my experience was very impressive thanks to Sarah and that damn beer cheese!!! lol I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"This is the worst place I have ever been to. The manager was rude and out of the 10 people in our group none of us will ever go back.  We cancelled our order only to have them bring it out to the bar and tell us that they were not going to charge us for the food as the staff was eating it."}
{"text":"Good vibe on the patio. Great service and the beer selection is huge. The wine selection is better than expected and priced well. 5 reds and whites. Missing a zinfandel on the red but they do have a malbec. No happy hour that we can find but it is opening day."}
{"text":"Cool place, nice selection if beers, decent staff. Been going there Sundays for brunch and NFL games and after 2 weeks server and manager remembers us by name which is nice and makes you feel somewhat special. Food is ok most importantly consistent."}
{"text":"Popped on a Friday night in the middle of July, which if you live in Phoenix you know it's the dead season for things going on in Tempe.    Service wasn't the quickest when we sat down at 7:45 took about 10 minutes to get our drink order and another 10 minutes for the drinks.  WOB was about half full at the time with a couple of the wait staff congregated at one end of the bar.   After the initial hiccup the server was on top the drinks.  Once the bar got busier the service got significantly better.   YMMV"}
{"text":"The Belgium beer on tap is great! Keep it coming. Patrick is super knowledgeable and very helpful. Bar is best place to sit. We usually arrive early right around opening time."}
{"text":"Came in while visiting from SF for spring training. I'm not a big beer drinker but came in with my husband who loves to try new beers and our bartender Steven was amazing. Extremely knowledgeable and excellent customer service, he hand picked flights based on our preferences. Highly recommend for beer drinkers & non-beer drinkers alike!"}
{"text":"What a selection. What? 500+ beers in one place? WOW! How do I choose? Great place to hang with friends for a few of the 500+ suds."}
{"text":"What can I say other than this is a great plaxe for CRAFT BEER. Tou should come here too!"}
{"text":"Great CRAFT BEER on tap at NOW 2 different locations plus beer brats and lunch specials make for a great experience.  Friendly Service as well.  What more does one need?"}
{"text":"I love going to world of beer there $5 Monday burger deal is the best! The staff is nice and helpful, definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Our server/bartender Matt is amazing! Super attentive! We had a party of 16 that moved from The bar to the patio and he remembered every drink and food order! We will definitely be back! If you go, ask for Matt!"}
{"text":"Basically a sports bar with a good beer selection, if that's your thing. Nowhere comfortable to sit, no food"}
{"text":"Went with my wife on a sunday at noon. We were the only couple there. Bartender was extremely knowledgeable with all the craft beers. Heard it can get a bit loud at night with the band but why not its a bar! We ordered food off the delivery menu which was really cool. When we venture to that side of town ill definitely stop in for the newest seasonal im sure they will have it on tap!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were pleasantly surprised with the offerings at this restaurant.  We came here for the first time this past Friday after voting.   I thought this was just another \"beer on tap\" restaurant - we were wrong.  We ordered the pretzel with beer cheese, the shrimp tacos and chicken wings.   All the dishes were quite tasty.  The pretzel was huge and tasted great on its own.  The shrimp tacos and wings were flavorful.   I recommend this restaurant.  They were busy but our server was attentive.  I'm sure it'll be crazy busy in the summer.   It's worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Slow service. Slow service. Slow service. Slow service.   Been there 2.5 times.    First time.  Slow service.  Waited 15 mins for a bartender to ask us if we wanted anything... then another 15 mins after we order to actually get the beer.  After 1 beer were were done and wanted to leave. Took another 15 mins to get the tab after we asked for it.  We made sure to pay cash as we didnt want to wait another 15 mins for the bartender to run a card.  2nd time.  Walked in.  Sat at a table.  Waited 20 mins.  No server.  Left.  3rd time.  Walked in.  Sat at far end of bar next to server station.  Waited 15 mins for bartender to make it down to that side of the bar.  While sitting there got to hear the servers complain about how slow the bartender is and that they too have been waiting or over 10 mins for the beers they ordered. So I felt better as it wasn't just the patrons the bartenders ignore.  Once we finally did get service at the bar we had a smooth time.    Don't know if I'll go back.  Maybe if i'm already on mill and theres nothing else to do...then maybe...maybe I'll go back and try it again.     Just really bummed.  Wanted this place to rock.  Love a good beer."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, awesome place to try something new with knowledgeable bar tenders...but...... If your hungry, menu is anemic, and what I have had was disappointing.  If this place had good... Not even great food... I'd give it 5 stars... You have to know there's a problem when they allow you to bring food from other restaurants"}
{"text":"Beer selection great and so is the big pretzel.  My problem with world of beer is the portion size of fries and onion rings..lacking..  You also have to check on the glass size before you order because they have a small glass that costs the same as a pint and im pretty sure it is about 3/4 the size. If you're looking for a nice place to drink some good beer and dont care how much you spend, then by all means go here.  but...  if you want a good deal and dont need 100 beers to choose from , then try some place else."}
{"text":"Excellent place to grab drinks and unwind. Sarah, our bartender, was amazing at picking the exact drinks we wanted. We will certainly be back when Sarah is working. Go wednesday thru Sunday when Sarah is working at the bar. You'll be take taken care of, guaranteed!"}
{"text":"We live in walking distance to World of Beer so I cannot comment on parking at all! We go to WOB pretty much every Wednesday for their trivia. I'm, personally, pretty much awful at trivia but, hey, I can just sit back and drink! They have an incredible beer slection and the staff is excellent. They are very knowledgable about the beers on tap.   The only reason WOB is getting 4 stars instead of 5 is the price. The beers are pretty pricey. There are drink specials every night but they arent posted that well. If there is a tap with something hanging around it, then it is on speical.....you never really know how much it is on special. Though, on the other hand, I appreciate craft brews and don't mind paying for them!  PS- No food here. JUST beer! Though, there is always food trucks parked outside and restaurants in the area will deliver to the bar."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this W.O.B location and having a chill drinking spot in the Epicenter.   My husband and I met after work one day this week for a drink and decided to check out WOB. There is a small outdoor area with tables and chairs that will be so nice in the summer time. Tons and tons of seating inside. They also have a couch in front of a TV where you can play video games (they had Mario Cart up when we were there).   Typically for all WOBs, there is a large beer selection for both cans/bottles and drafts. I loved that they had tablets where you could see all their beers and filter on various attributes (type, color, ABV, flavor, etc). Additionally, WOB serves liquor and wine. I noticed that this location has food and drink specials every day. On the day we went, it was 25% off cans/bottles and $5 mules. I got a London Mule and it was delish!   While we didn't get any food, they have $5 Happy Hours of small plates. All the food coming out of the kitchen looked good.  Overall, great location and excited to see how they fit into the Epicenter bar scene!"}
{"text":"I normally only review my favorite places and don't like to slight a business online as the majority of negative reviews tend to be about a bad server or a one time experience, and considering this place just had it's grand opening yesterday this review should also be taken with a grain of salt. That being said I do already have some legitimate concerns so I am only giving it two stars using Yelp's own definition of \"Meh. I've experienced better\" and would consider a follow up review at another time if I ever returned.  I was excited for the grand opening and had been following their updates on Twitter and Facebook for a couple of months. The first thing we noticed when we pulled into South End was there was absolutely no where to park. The announcement e-mail mentioned 28 spots were reserved for World of Beer in the Circle @ Southends parking garage, but those were full the moment the place opened at 3 so I wondered if the staff had taken those as there are no other options besides parking in a neighboring business lot and walking.  I'm not sure of the towing policies at those lots, but at least for last night we got away with using that method.  They have a great layout and plenty of beers on tap.  I scanned the menu and saw a lot of my favorites, but was disappointed that I didn't really notice anything unique I haven't already had at say VBGB or the Flying Saucer.  It seems that still the only place to find some of the rarest beers in Charlotte is directly from Brawleys. As this was my first time at a World of Beer I had no idea that food was not served here.  We had arrived hungry after work and were again reminded of the poor parking situation when we realized food trucks couldn't even stop by this place. They did have a take out menu created from nearby businesses that would deliver to the restaurant, but who wants to go through the hassle.  For that reason alone this immediately puts World of Beer on the bottom of my list of favorite watering holes, but maybe the majority of patrons knew this going into it.  So while the atmosphere, patio, and beer selection are all there, the prices, parking, and lack of food keep me from recommending this to anyone except residents that live within walking distance of this spot and have money to burn.  I love that Charlotte has this place now, but unless they are organizing more special nights with giveaways or tastings I probably won't be back again."}
{"text":"Tracy was so nice helpful we will be back food was great very fun place to go really glad we tried it to night she made are visit worth every min always came back and made sure we where happy"}
{"text":"Stop by after doing a bit of shopping , food was geat and everyone was so friendly,  especially our server derinca . She would constantly check to make sure we were doing find . Recommend new beers to try. Overall great experience . Going back for sure!"}
{"text":"For what they claim as the \"Hangout featuring 500+ global beers, lots of craft drafts & tavern food in pub digs with TVs\" I really thought the place would be bigger.  We met a group of friends here on a Friday night around 8 pm. I know this is Wisconsin, but the place was buzzing with kids running around the tables, bar area, up and down on the stage with no end in sight.  It was hard to get situated with a party bigger than 6. There are no private rooms or table reservations so everything is just first come first serve. You are out of luck if you are caught in between what apparently is a kiddie rush and bar time.  Trying to flag down staff was a chore. Bartenders had to check with servers, who had to check with bussers to pinpoint a question about which tables were up for grabs. A few member of our group ordered from a bartender/server going around, while the other couldn't get serviced and just ordered at the bar.  As soon as a refill finally came, someone else in our party was dry. It became a vicious cycle.  They do have a relatively large beer selection, but the numbers are inflated a bit because they do list Lawnmower beers like Miller Lite and the likes on the tap list. The other 450+ selections? Bottles. They are bottled beers.  So if you are a true beer fanatic and a draught beer purist, try HopCat where they actually have over 100 craft beers on tap.  TL;DR: They had CitruSinensis on tap, kids running rampant, didn't get the food."}
{"text":"I am in love with this place. the food is fantastic, the verity of beer is awesome, the games are fun, family place and the waiters and waitresses are so friendly. our waiter Jason was worth coming here. So personable. I encourage everyone and anyone to come here."}
{"text":"So we came here after a movie at the nearby San Tan Harkins and were disappointed by the serving size for the hefty prices they charge for \"specials\". My glass of unibroue noire de chambly was almost $10 for a small glass(not even wine glass size portion). The selection of craft and local beers was good but for the price, I would stick to domestics and other pub options in the nearby area!"}
{"text":"I rated this place earlier in August. It was my first ever Yelp review and I didn't know what I was doing. Accidentally gave it 3 stars instead of the 5 it deserved. I'm home in Tampa now and just noticed I made the mistake. Hope all u ASU fans and Phoenix locals will try it . The staff is professional and the Sonoran White Chocolate is amazing! Wish we could get it in Fl!! Cheers!"}
{"text":"The server offered a taster, but took it to another table. After 20 minutes, we had to flag down a different server to get a beer."}
{"text":"So much Yelp hate for so much beer.  Came on Friday after work and it was already buzzing (as were probably a few folks as well).  It's deceivingly small and I had to stand nearly the entire time.  However, the servers making the rounds provided surprisingly excellent service.  When I was nearing the end of a drink, someone came and asked me what else I could get.    Both myself and a pal signed up for the WOB loyalty card - $15 and they keep track of your beer consumption (including provide eligibility for awards like t-shirts) and gives you 25% off on Tuesdays.  Lookout BWW, WOB is my new Tuesday spot!  It may be growing pains or just general apathy, but I don't think the staff really know a lot (or anything?) about the beers as I was told that a specific beer had been labeled \"unique\" because it didn't have any taste (??).  Granted, I couldn't rattle off details about 500+ beers either, so this may be a dumb observation.  I also came on a night without live music, but it looks like the top floor is reserved ONLY for that.  I feel like they should open that up for a bit more space.  And I also wonder just how freaking loud would this place be with a band?!  I recommend you follow their Facebook page for details of their Thursday Ladies' Night specials, live music, giveaways, and events."}
{"text":"Always crazy when we go in there.  The manager is always willing to go above and beyond for customers though.  Beer selection is great, food selection could be better variety."}
{"text":"Went back April 2nd to see if anything had changed and still disappointed. Very expensive and this time all the ABV's were in the double digits. Those of you who like beer know that a double digit ABV beer is an at home drinking beer. If you drink two to three you are DUI or stumbling home on public transport. I like to slowly drink my craft beer and enjoy the taste. It is my #1 item I will pay more for on my budget. I had just come from another beer bar, Taste of Tops down the road. I actually called my buddy the next morning because the bar charged me $22.00 for a flight (4, 4oz tasters) to verify his cost. It was not a mistake!! That's almost 3 times the price I paid at Tops! Go to Taste of Tops unless you want like being in a high rent bar that charges too much and has tons of ASU drunkards in it with automaton servers.  I will give them this...there food is good and their beer selection is very good."}
{"text":"I don't understand how anyone who loves a good craft beer can dislike this place! It is a beer lovers mecca! They have the best selection of bottled beer in NEO as well as continuous rotating taps. The bartenders are a blast to chat with as well as explaining all the beers and helping you pick the best choice for you. What a great place to meet fellow beer lovers!  Happy hour is M-F, 3-7pm $1 off all drafts  *Be advised they do not have a food menu but you can bring in any food you want and you can have food delivered to you at the bar."}
{"text":"Great spot with great service! We sat at the bar and Tyler was an amazing bartender. They have daily specials plus happy hour. We got the French dip which was excellent! It's a new spot and you can tell. It's very clean and well decorated. Great selection of beer and a good food menu also. Can't wait for brunch to start!"}
{"text":"No more pickles? What??? Jeremiah's service was impeccable (as always), and so were the wings. But no more pickles??? Come on!"}
{"text":"I really hate to do this downgrade, but I have to for the sake of all those that love good beer and some sort of decent service.  After my fourth visit, I'll likely refrain from stopping in to  WOB for quite some time. 15 minutes at a table, and 10 at the bar, and still no one would talk to us to take our orders and money. Even after trying to flag folks down at the bar and table, my friends and I were totally ignored. Sure, they have a phenomenal selection of beer, but that doesn't do me a bit of good if no one will take my order. The employees were too busy yucking it up with each other to pay us any mind at all.  Hopefully they'll educate their employees here pretty soon. I would love to spend money here, but they have to want to take it, first."}
{"text":"A great local place in Henderson with an enormous selection of beer. I have never had any service issues. I've only tried one food item (the BBQ Chicken Flatbread) and thought it was good.  The main focus is definitely the beer. I always try something new every time I am in and have yet to be let down. Though sometimes it's hard to know exactly what they have, especially in the coolers. But I use their app to know exactly what's available."}
{"text":"Decent food, good service, chill atmosphere.  Stopped in for a bite and a brew and were treated very well by our server, Ben, who had a great personality and seemed to be having a lot of fun.  Way too many beer choices for us, but we managed to make decisions and were not disappointed.  We split an order of onion rings and a Rueben and both were good.  Really liked the horseradish-laden dipping sauce for the rings.  All in all a good solid place."}
{"text":"While out in Gilbert AZ visiting family, they told me about this place called World of Beers. Being a beer drinker naturally I had to check this place out. It looks like a restaurant upon arrival but when they bring the menus its all beer! With 50+ taps and at least 200 bottles you're bound to find a brew to suit your palate. This place has it all from fruity beers to hop heavy ipas. I always try to drink local brews when visiting new spots. So I went with a Dragoon brewing co. IPA pretty hoppy just like I like 'em. The service was pretty good our server never left us sitting with an empty glass for long. The bacon cheese that came out with out gigantic pretzel we ordered was awesome. Wish I could've drank it literally lol.. Well if you're ever out here check it out."}
{"text":"Someone must have talked to the staff about their poor service in the past few weeks, at least at the bar. I was asked 3 or 4 times while waiting for my drink, if I needed a drink.  I also got my complete change back.  But really adding tax in a bar- who does that?  I must say the female bartender I ordered from knew her Beer, she asked my girlfriend what she liked, then brought her a few samples, one of which was dead on.  I was actually kinda impressed.  My only complaint about the bar was they said they had 550 bottles in the cooler, but no one knew what bottles they had.  It all went downhill from there, I went into the back room, which was empty.  I found out it was empty because it was rented out to a private party.  On a Friday.  At least the waitress was nice about it, but no sign or anything letting me know ahead of time.  As luck would have it I find a table with 3 other people right after I was kicked out of the vault room.  However, at the table the Stone 16th Anniversary IPA I drank must have doubled as an invisibility portion-  The waitress waiting on the bros on either side of me either could not see us, or seemed to think our empty glasses meant we were too old to have another beer, apparently she does not know thirty somethings have real jobs and can leave tips.  I'd go back... if I rented out the back room, otherwise Mellow Mushroom has a comparable beer selection at least on tap."}
{"text":"Checked this place out for the first time last night.  It's a great new bar in Lakewood and I like the concept of just beer and music, but some things need improving.  The beer selection is amazing, and we enjoyed a flight to try some of them out.  I like the set up of the place also, and don't think the prices are too bad for the beer selection they have.  Our service was not up to par.  The waitress wasn't very knowledgeable, and there were long periods of time with no service attention.  It was pretty busy when we got there, but nothing too crazy.  They seemed to need more wait staff.    Also, there is no food available, but you can order from surrounding restaurants if you want to and have it delivered there.  Some sort of snack like popcorn or nuts would be nice though.    I'm sure i'll be back at some point this summer and hope to have a little better experience."}
{"text":"Limited beer actually available on tap. Hell, I could slap a sticker on a tap and call it whatever I wanted to, doesn't make it true. Even if they did have all of the beer they claimed, it's still not enough to call it a \"world\" of beer. Seriously limited in supply and variety. Our group headed up the street to another establishment after only one round and found better selections."}
{"text":"This place is great! Love the patio area even though it's rather small. Staff is great! Beer selection is some of the best in all of Cleveland. Could be more competitive with pricing."}
{"text":"Clean. Fun. Friendly. Very good food, and an AWESOME collection of beers on draught.  Eat the Mac & Cheese Bites. They are delish!  Really, what more is there to say?  Okay; this -  I generally avoid corporate eateries. You're far more likely to find me at a no-name Mom & Pop dive somewhere than at another cookie-cutter \"pub\". TGIFriday's? eegadz! Outback?? Heavens, NO!  So nobody is more surprised than I to find this neighborhood-friendly-feeling place at a mall. I've been back several times, and continue to be delighted by the food, beer selection, and clientele.  LGBTQ+ friendly. The bartenders treated my boyfriend and I very well, and we had fun with the rest of the crowd."}
{"text":"Dear GM or Owner or whover is in charge Your bouncers are extremely rude and maybe borderline racists. I came in here last saturday, no issue with attire. My friend luvs ur beer and she wanted to get one last drink. Bouncers wouldnt let her in providing reasons that she is too intoxicated already. She has 2 shot the entire night before that. I was the DD and i didnt have anthing.  Bouncers name was Fernando. I left her in the car, i  wanted to come in by myself. They would nt let me in. This is the worst customer service experience i ever had. We used to go to ur bar all the time and recommend to so many of our friends. You just cost urself $ 1000 of bussiness min, because I am so angry right now I am gonna single handedly take you ratings down on yelp. My number is 718 683 8274. Find me if u need to speak to me."}
{"text":"Two days in a row, not too impressed.  Fredi, our wonderful bartender again gets five stars.  Food gets three.  We ordered the HH Barbacoa that was terrible & dripping w/ oil.  The shredded beef was soggy w/ the overbearing sauce so I gave it to my starving guy friend & ordered another one, plain.  The plain was dry & I narrowed it down to the beef just not being right.  I shared it w/ my girlfriend & she couldn't finish her half either.  We told Fredi, but we had already paid our bill so she told the chef.  Change it please.   The Tuscan or Pesto Hummus was great, but I wish they put veggie sticks & Pita, instead of Pico de Gallo & Pita... which none of us ate.    Very nice beer selection of course & they no longer have the free beer w/ check-in offer fyi.  I'm not a beer drinker so no big deal, but it was a nice offer.    Chicken Salad after five or six bites was horrible, we thought it would get better, but it was tasteless & not totally fresh.  I thought ok let's try the Macaroni & Cheese, not the fried bites, how could we go wrong here... it was burnt w/ hardly any cheese.  What in the world!  I will say to be on the safe side the Hummus & he Chimay Burger are the best.  Other than that, some items need to be changed or done away with.  Sorry Wolf, you left before I could mention these things to you.  We will be back & hope to upgrade the stars, but it will be awhile."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped in to have a quick appetizer and beer and were severely disappointed with the service. When we sat down we each asked for a sample of a beer before we went ahead and ordered a pint, and put in an order of chips and salsa. It took our server over 30 minutes to bring our samples while we sat with nothing to drink. Take in mind that the restaurant was at half capacity at best. After we tried the sample we waited another 15 minutes to see if she would ask us if we'd like to order a pint and she never came. At this point we got up and walked out and went somewhere else."}
{"text":"I wish I could remember the gentlemans name that helped us but unfortunately I can't. My husband and I went in yesterday for a few beers and sat at the bar. The man who helped us is from Oregon and just moved here in January for school. He had a great amount of knowledge and was very willing to share it with us. He let us try all different types of beers, explained to us different types of pours and kept great conversation the entire time. They also have an amazing selection of brews. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Love this place. Matt, Garrick, Mush, Everyone has been Fantastic . A Super good beer program Dry rub wings are bomb. Best happy hour in town. Its Like my tenth time here never let down"}
{"text":"World of beer is a good time at the epicenter for those not trying to go to clubs and have a more relaxed atmosphere. The service is great and the restaurant is clean...the Mario Kart and card games give serious nostalgia is unique for a bar in the epicenter. They offer a nice range of food to choose from as well. I got the hummus which was great and 10 wings tossed in Korean spicy (highly recommend). My only complaint was the beer braut. Probably the most underwhelming thing I've ever seen. A massive philly cheese steak like roll with a piece of meat half the size of the roll. Took me two bites before I had any meat in my mouth. Best solution either put a bigger piece of meat between those buns or find a smaller bun to put the meat in. In this case size matters."}
{"text":"World of beer had a great selection of beers. The fact that I knew more about there selection was the only reason I didn't rate it a 5 star. You normally get this kind of service in touristy parts of the city for Tempe this was above par. Still a go to for serious beer though. Service was so so."}
{"text":"Was a customer at this establishment 2 weeks ago. Ordered a Blue Moon Beer and a salad. First time I've ever gotten a Blue Moon beer without an orange slice and that's in the US and overseas. Little did I know it was the beginning of what was to come. Salad greens were not fresh but wilted/old and salad was suppose to have dressing but there was none. First time ever I've sent a meal back and didn't reorder anything. Drank my beer and left. Mgmt was non-responsive although they did deduct my salad from my bill but Mgmt was nowhere in sight. Don't eat at this joint ......"}
{"text":"I travel a bit (and rarely review) but this spot has one of the most unattentative bar staff I've encountered in some time.  Two girls beside me received two beers each before I could enter my food order.   Apparently \"field greens\" actually means \"iceberg lettuce.\"  Wings were really good.   Beer selection was great but bartenders could exhibit a little more excitement and energy."}
{"text":"Awesome pub. Great beer and great food. Not sure a up other reviewers experience the staff l, but During my times here the wait staff were awesome."}
{"text":"This place is just incredible, all the World and AZ beers you can handle!! My only disappointment was the food was just ok, the tater tots were cooked just right though!"}
{"text":"So excited this place is so close!!! Sunday funday friends!!!! Yay!! I can't wait to be back next week !!"}
{"text":"Nice place. Good location. Not sure what the other reviewers that complained about parking were expecting. Convenient garage an lots of on street within a 2 block radius. Beer and lots of it. Overwhelming. Rather generic interior and sluggish service. But good spot for an interesting beer or 4. Mondays are half off Charlotte brews. Great deal!!"}
{"text":"Yes, I'm definitely a fan of World of Beer.  First of all, the design was great.  Plenty of seating, small stage for music, a gosh darn wall of taps, and a garage door on the side for outdoor seating with heat lamps.  They boast over 150 beers from......around the world! (betcha didn't guess that!)  Their menu consisted of some standard bar far items, but amped up a bit.  We tried the tots and the wings and both were tasty.  The wings were huge and came with ample amounts of Ranch to dip in.  They provide you with an iPad so you can learn more about each beer they have.  It's a little overwhelming, but if it's all too much, I recommend sticking to what they have on tap, which rotates and is still a large enough selection to accommodate any taste.  One other feature I liked was that you can build your own flight.  I asked for a flight of pumpkin beers and was granted that wish.  I'm more of a slow-sipper, sampler when it comes to beer, so the flight was right up my alley and the price was too.  Only $10 to build my own.   They do have a loyalty club.  Points for every beer you purchase and 25% off beers on Tuesday I believe.  But it is $15 to join.  We didn't see the value in it this time. In one corner, they seemed to have a supply of games to occupy children while their parents drink and watch sports on the multitude of televisions they have.  Not sure I'd take my kid to \"World of Beer\", but hey, to each their own.  Husband says we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. They have such a wide variety of beers. Only downside is they typically don't have the same beer the next week but hey change is nice. Have tried most of their menu which is all pretty tasteful. The bartender Matt is the best! He's very knowledgeable and has great recommendations."}
{"text":"I came here around 7 PM on a Sunday evening with my beer-loving uncle and his wife and left very satisfied. The restaurant wasn't full, but wasn't dead either - a nice laid back atmosphere. The beer selection is impressive with a front/back full page draft menu and an iPad which logs their 500 beer bottle selection. We began our meal with Tavern Tots per server recommendation. They were good, but not incredibly impressive. My uncle ordered the Black & Bleu flatbread which he thoroughly enjoyed and had great things to say about. My aunt ordered the veggie wrap with hummus which she enjoyed, but felt the hummus was a bit overwhelming for her. I ordered the boneless buffalo wings which were delicious - and they weren't just chicken nuggets served as boneless wings like you find at many places. As we were dining I noticed they have specials all week long such as Industry Night, Student & Faculty night, Ladies Night and more with great drink specials. Overall, we had a pleasant dining experience and enjoyed the expansive beer selection. I will be returning when I have more beer-loving friends and family in town."}
{"text":"Took us ten minutes to be seated with no other guests in front of us waiting. After 30 minutes and not even getting a drink order in or a single employee acknowledging us, we decided to take our business elsewhere.   Although after reviewing their menu (since we had an ample amount of time to do so) nothing truly caught my eye. Prices were a little steap for a new rastaurant and in Henderson..."}
{"text":"I don't know why we haven't stopped in sooner! We've seriously been missing out!   They have a great beer list and good priced appetizers! What more can a 20-something year old want?   Food recommendations: everything on the happy hour list. Seriously, just get one of everything and maybe two of the margarita flat breads.   *Don't regret not trying a few of the beers!"}
{"text":"Fantastic beer selection.  Both tap beer and bottled beer selection are expansive.  Lots of work to do here.  Giant pretzels are a nice Bavarian touch.  I'll be back for a visit soon."}
{"text":"After having a horrible experience at the new place C.A.S.A across the street we moseyed on over to WOB. I've been in a few times now and each time I've enjoyed my experience. (Side note I've only sat at the bar so this review is mainly about my experience sitting at the bar).  WOB is awesome when it comes to the selection of beer and the bartenders really know their stuff.  Food is decent... Not the best but not bad. Service is always friendly and fast!"}
{"text":"The food and beer selection is good! The horrible thing about this place is Richie the server. He had poor customer service and listening skills. We placed the order and came back and asked us what we had ordered. He was bothered and had an attitude when I asked him he brought me and rang the wrong beer. He became more rude when he had to correct his mistake. Unacceptable service."}
{"text":"I brought a friend from out of town here to show this place off. Instead I won't be returning. They got her food order wrong twice and ended up taking it from her even though she was eating it. She ordered waffles, that was it! I was furious. One bad server is all it takes to ruin a place for me. I won't be coming back here. Good place for beer, not for food."}
{"text":"First!!!!!!!! Amazing bar. Matt is the best. Very knowledgeable about beer and the nicest guy around."}
{"text":"4.5 Stars  This is a pretty amazing place for the beer enthusiast. WOB has an amazing selection of beers on tap and in bottles.  There are quite a few things I have never heard or seen on tap which is always a pleasant surprise.  The staff on our few visits have been very nice and helpful suggesting beers from the huge menu.  They lose a 1/2 star only for the fact that they have no food at all in the place.  I appreciate that they just want to have beer which is great, but they really need pretzels, beer nuts, fries, wings, something.  They are right next to Five Guys so we usually do rock, paper, scissors and send someone over to get fries.  This is a great place just needs snacks or eat before you go."}
{"text":"Wanna have FUN??  Then World of Beer is for you!!  From the HUGE Pretzel that is AhhhMahhZingggg to the array of beers that tilt the spectrums, this place doesn't NOT disappoint !!!    We went for my dad's 81st birthday tonight and he hasn't stopped raving and talking about how great his Guinness Brat was tonight along with his Evil Twin Even More Jesus Beer (Great Name)!!  You've got a built in marketing person now LOL  I had the margarita flatbread that was YUM along with the Coronado Party Boat Beer - sad part was I could t bring home a growl. Lol  The Mac and Cheese another person in our party had was soooo good as were the cheeseburgers!!  Our service was 1000000%!!!!!   Go Go Go!!  We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"The margherita flatbread is amazing. Had the Korean spicy wings and they were pretty good."}
{"text":"Wow this place has really gone down hill. I've been going here since it first opened and I had my worst experience yet. I went to watch a postseason baseball game after work and sat at a table by myself. It was beautiful outside so I sat at the patio and about five minutes later the bartender comes by and tells me I can't wait the baseball game from here. He said something was wrong with the TVs. I thought oh okay that's odd and went inside.   There seemed to be six-seven TVs Inside and one is black, the TV in the center is busted and playing an intermittent signal, and only Two have the baseball game on. The rest are playing a weight loss infomercial. I thought to myself, no wonder why this place is no longer packed on a Saturday night. The people wanting to grab a beer and watch a few games went to Blue32, Gordon, or even Thirsty Lion now. What a waste! There was maybe five Cuba fans crowded by the working TVs. Don't you guy realize we are in a Mecca for baseball fans with spring training and etc? Maybe you'd capitalize on all of us if you actually played the games in an entertaining atmosphere? I'd be shocked to see this continue this way come NHL/NBA/NFL season.   They were also playing sad 90s alternative music which was a downer on the entire Saturday night mood. I was so disappointed. Also, my server only started checking on me once my boyfriend had arrived. That is so obnoxious because I'm the one with the money. Why do you think I won't order food or beer by myself while I waited for him? Who knows.    I hope you guys really turn things around because you do tend to carry the best beer variety and had great servers before. Bring them back!"}
{"text":"Okay, this place has so much potential. Back home we had a World of Beer, awesome place and food.   This location has great food and a grey beer selection. But my God..... the service is horrible! Bartenders hate their job and the manager was a little bit of an asshole who doesn't cater to his guests.  I will still come here, considering the wonderful Sunday deal. $23 for bottomless mimosas, beermosas, or blood Mary's plus a breakfast item. Can't beat that deal. But we felt like we were in church, small crowd, we asked to turn ONE of the games up (denied) then we asked if we could at least hear music  (denied). So basically we heard everyone's conversation the whole time we were there.   Again, this place has potential, if the manager and Bartenders didn't have such rude remarks I would be recommending this place. But not until they get it together"}
{"text":"Exactly what the name is. Servers and bartenders are knowledge of all beers. They have wine for those of you who don't care for beer and rumor is in a few weeks they will have liquor. Ask for Jess as a server."}
{"text":"I hated this place from the moment I stepped onto the patio and had my first encounter with the rude security people.  There wasn't enough seating maybe just two small tables outside on patio.  When you enter the building its tiny inside with very little seating as well and too much space is used up for walking space.  The layout is just poorly done.  Walked up to the bar to order a drink and waited patiently for quite sometime before the bar tender came over and helped a rude drunk that pushed his way up right next to me well almost on top of me.  I literally had to push the drink guy off of me and tell him to chill out.  I pushed him off of me several times.  The bar tender was beyond rude catering to the drunk man saying hey listen we are all here to have fun but that was directed at me the sober lady that had been waiting patiently for someone to take my order.  The dumb bar tender should have asked if he could help me but of course he was too stupid to do that and the drunk was argumentative and apologetic you know an annoying apologetic drunk.  It was awesome.  The place totally sucks.  My husband and I both said that the whole vibe was a bad one, the seating sucked, the building sucks, and the employees were negative and rude.  Would never go back."}
{"text":"I'm here just about once a week. Great and ever changing selection of beer, all the local favorites and food spots just a walk away. TV screens all over, Jenga and board games. They even have a selection of blended brews. If you're ever in south end, stop by."}
{"text":"Do you like beer???   Lots and lots and lots of different beers??   Then this is DEFINITELY the place for you.   They have a cool iPad menu system that lets you sort by style, region, alcohol percentage, etc etc...   the staff is knowledgeable and friendly and the atmosphere and patio are very nice.  The tater tots are NOT to be missed...   also I like the pretzel, tacos (especially the shrimp) a lot."}
{"text":"Great service and great food! The local beer and ciders were fantastic! Allergy friendly for both gluten and MSG!"}
{"text":"Get the $25 brunch with your friends. It's the best deal and sit outside. It's literally the best. There's tv, people watching or you can just chat the morning away while getting boozy haha Food is also delicious-loved everything I've tried so far!"}
{"text":"Nothing special. A lot of tvs to watch sports teams. My husband and I didn't love the food. Service was okay."}
{"text":"The food here is awesome with the right beer pairing. Even if you don't know anything about craft beer and food pairings anything you eat will be great with any craft beer you order. The bartenders are more than knowledgable, they are experts! The beer is exquisite and the selections change all the time. I would recommend the Hebrew st. Lenny's it is my favorite double IPA and goes very well with the black and blue flatbread. Service is always great for me but I am a regular, I tip very generously and I am just all around loveable. I love this place and I recommend that you try it"}
{"text":"Great selection of beer obviously, food was delicious, the tater tots & buffalo chicken sandwich were amazing. Personally I order the tour of Belgium and the samples were all great. Solid customer service too, had a great time."}
{"text":"Food is Damn good. I ordered the chicken BBQ flat bread with Mac n cheese and my husband ordered the Chimay burger and it was all super delicious. The Mac and cheese was impressively good. Ordered some drinks as well and Justin the bar tender was very attentive and helpful. Had the Fall Favorites beer flight. Great service and great food at the bar during lunch time on a Tue. Will come back for sure."}
{"text":"So I was super skeptical about going here after reading all the scathing reviews, but I liked it! We went prior to an ASU game a few weeks back and managed to get a table but it fills up FAST. You've to go in there realizing their specialty is beer and that's about it. Our server was very knowledgeable and I told her I like wheat beers and to put together some flights for me. I was extremely impressed with her choices! Their beer selection is outstanding and their drink menu is very detailed.  Minus one star b/c of the whole \"no food\" thing. You can call in food from Jimmy John's, Slices, etc. but I still think that's weird."}
{"text":"one of my favorite beers is served here so of course i love this place! mother earths cali creamin but they have it infused with strawberry which i think makes it even better. had the chicken and waffle sandwich which was tasty. also decided to try woodchuck barrel reserve cider which was really light and refreshing."}
{"text":"My husband has been dying to try this place and since he had continuing education nearby one weekend, I figured we would give it a shot.  We came in around 12:30 on a Saturday and the place was relatively empty except for a large table of about 15 people that was just getting seated and a few loners at the bar.  I was pretty disappointed right away when I looked at the menu and noticed it was Brunch only.  I am not a big breakfast food person so the menu was immediately halved in my mind.  There was only 1 waitress and she quickly got overwhelmed with the large table and then shortly after we got our drinks the place filled up quick.  She took the large table's order while we waited and then she skipped over us and when and took another table's order even though they got there much later than us.  We waited 20 mins for her to take our order after we got our drinks.  I am a fairly picky person so I ended up just ordering a plain cheeseburger (which is not really on the menu) and fries.  My husband ordered the chicken waffle sandwich and my daughter ordered grilled cheese.  My husband's chicken on his sandwich was completely over done.  I wouldn't have even eaten it but he was pretty hungry at that point so just dealt with it.  My cheeseburger came out with all the fixings on it even though I had ordered it plain.  I asked for a rootbeer and she brought it without any ice which I thought was odd.  Overall we probably won't be back.  The service was subpar at best and the food wasn't any better.  If we do come back it will be when they have a full lunch/dinner menu available.  If you are a picky eater I wouldn't even bother, their menu is \"different\" to say the least."}
{"text":"WoB is a kicked back bar that does honor its name with a pretty darn good selection of brew.  They have indoor and outdoor seating and though a little cramped it is nice sitting on the patio section.  It is open seating so if you see a good spot grab it.  The tap selection is hefty and they organize their beers into categories based on  characteristics like \"hop forward\" or light and crisp. This helps those that want to experiment a bit stay away from brews they may not like.  The food is pretty good and the sausage board and the pretzel were excellent.  the service was attentive but lacking a bit in friendliness.  On the down side i thought the prices were a bit high and unfortunate nobody can control the ass clowns driving by in loud cars with music blaring.  The types that have completely ruined the mill ave experience in Tempe for me.  I guess if you have a small one between your legs you need a big motor and subwoofer to help compensate."}
{"text":"This place would be a four as far as the deals and food are concerned, however our server took forever just to get our drinks to us and everything else throughout the entire time we were there. Plus the check was messed up not once, but twice. We've been there a few times and never had an issue up until today. Maybe it has to do with the holiday, who knows? We  definitely try again and hopefully the service we better next time around."}
{"text":"This WOB was fine, but a bit if a disappointment overall. Other locations i have been to had coolers filled edge to edge with beers from around the world. This location had lots of empty cooler space, so the shock and awe was absent for me.  I mean, the draft beer selection was good. I had \"Big Bad Baptist\" from Epic, and there were plenty of other solid choices.  I visited laaate night on a wednesday night, and we caught the end of karaoke. Overall it was like other WOBs....just not the full coolers to impress my visual sense."}
{"text":"Good place.  I enjoyed the over-sized Pretzel.  The bar staff was friendly, personable and gave a great \"tour\" of the local beers.  To be fair, It's not so much a destination visit as I found myself in Henderson on one of my Las Vegas visits and was very happy to have come across this bar.  Thanks WoB!"}
{"text":"Seems like a trend with either this establishment or the one at San Tan.  Really didn't care to frequent this place but do the availability of choices before an ASU game, they were the only one's who had tables left.  We were the only one's who ordered food which should have been a red flag, if anything people were getting pretzels which I think can't be hard to screw up...every other table just had drinks.  Their menu is pretty pathetic, no actual burgers just sliders.  I ordered the most expensive one on there for $10.50, you get two tiny bloated beef patties on an oversized bun.  The meat smelled and tasted rancid and was beyond dry and hard to swallow.  They also give you about 10 steak fries.  Somehow the shrimp tacos are $7, and you get twice as much as food.  The server was average, appeared to be hung over and not interested in working.  Done with WOB for good."}
{"text":"Fast service. Good food. Friendly atmosphere. Stopped in here because I walked out of another place for no service at all and being ignored. Good job WOB!"}
{"text":"The GF and I had an appointment on the other side of the valley in the kingdom on Hendo.  After a trip of such magnitude, one or two needs food and maybe a beer or two.  I hopped on the trusty lap top and begged the hamsters to work as I fired up the yelp.com. BOOM!  WOB presented it's self.  Arrived in the all too familiar mall parking lot, I have parked in, who knows how many times. Walked an ohhhh soooo familiar walk......and then I reached down and opened the door for my lady and in we stepped.  In we walked into a magical world with 500 (bottled) beers on the wall. Take one down...pass it around...500 bottles of beer on the wall...Wait, what....Take one down, pass it around...four hun..500 bottles of beer on the wall.  Confused?  Don't be!  There is always one to replace the original..but I digress.  We were greeted in happy fashion.  Met two other employees, sort of, before a nice lady came to take our order.  There are all sorts of beers!  Over 500 for that matter.  There is something for everyone!  If you check in on yelp, you can get a local beer for free!!  The southern Nevada beer scene is awesome!  This particular check-in allowed me to sample another Lovelady gem, which is also not to far away, I might add.  The GF had some crazy infused cider from some even crazier contraption at the bar.  It was divine!    I took in the atmo, very pubish, with lighting I have seen in other places on the west coast.  During lunch on a Friday, I found the vibe to quit relaxing, my physical reaction to finding an awesome venue at the Galleria Mall, I found shocking!  Malls are not cool nor are they relaxing.  Not a lot of people.  Large televisions were everywhere.  The service was friendly.  I took note of the retractable walls that led to the outside.  Cool October desert air flowing inside.  The though of these same portals being open during a monsoonal storm, made me emotionally erect. Sipping cool brew, while a T-storm rips through Hendo....would be awesome!  The food:  I asked our lady what she recommended, and she instantly said, \"Chimay Burger.\"  Well now!  Chimay is monk beer made with pixy dust.  I'll have that!  \"Fresh beef burger piled high with Chimay Classique cheese, sautéed mushrooms, & caramelized onions. Served on a brioche bun with house-made Chimay sauce. Complement it with a Belgian Tripel\" (retrieved from http://www.worldofbeer.com).  Ordered medium well....it knocked my socks off.  The tots that accompanied it were equally awesome!  Great spot!  I would absolutely visit again!  After further inspection of my review....I am giving WOB and extra star!"}
{"text":"Chimay burger is one of my favorites. I've never been one to visit the same resaurant more than once but I have to admit... I've been here 6 times while I was here for work. The lagunitas underground strong ale is amazing! Yummo!"}
{"text":"Amazing selection of beers! Great happy hour specials. The burgers are really good. Atmosphere- relaxed, but loud; many tvs. Watch out if you get a booth because the light is dark."}
{"text":"Been going to WOB since it opened. A great selection of beers from around the World (52 beers on tap 500 plus bottles). Food is creative & good, service friendly and efficient.  They bring in a lot of Craft Brewery's. The taps change from time to time, which makes it more interesting experience.  Always a good crowd & a good time. Nice addition to Middleton."}
{"text":"Great food, very good service, nice atmosphere, and plenty of beer + other drinks to choose from!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"A bar in a nice uptown area. A lot of different beers, but I try none of them :p  There is an open space or you can seat inside."}
{"text":"So thank god for good beer, 20 minutes and no food. Absolutely dead in here, and did i mention no chicken products in stock. Lucky i wanted some beer .... Did discount for wait, so not to bad."}
{"text":"This place is excellent if you're a beer drinker! My husband and I visit WOB often, there's something for both of us! They have a great program you can sign up for and track all of the beers you've tried, and get rewards for it. They have a unique menu, it's not extensive, it is delicious! Give it a try!"}
{"text":"If you are in the mood to try a new beer, come here. They, obviously, have a LOT to choose from both on draft and in bottles. Loss of stars is just based on the price. This is not somewhere I could come regularly and have a couple apps and several beers. Too pricey. But it is in San Tan market and they are nicer beers so I get it. More of a \"special occasion, max 2 beers spot\" if you ask me. Would definitely bring people from out of town. Pretzel and beer cheese was good! Huge pretzel."}
{"text":"Food was good, beer was warm and service was horrible. Waited for more than 10 min to be told to sit wherever we want. Service started out semi okay, but quickly went down hill. Our waitress disappeared, someone brought our food. We had our food but no napkins or utensils. We ate, then waited for our bill, and waited then waited some more. Finally caught our waitress and waited another 10 minutes for the bill. Overall very unimpressed."}
{"text":"I haven't had any of their food so I can not speak to that, but I can on the beer selection and atmosphere. The beer selection is fantastic, so you should be able to find whatever you want here. The place is kept clean and inviting. I think I will have to try the food next time."}
{"text":"World of Beer? Should be world of poor service. Went there at 4pm on a Friday, sat at the bar and waited and waited. Finally after literally 15 minutes trying to flag one of FOUR bartenders , we left. There are plenty of places to go..So sad because I had just been there a few nights before and had great service and tried a new beer. It wasn't really that busy, I dont understand it.  We will give it one more try..."}
{"text":"Good rotating beers. Foods ok. Atmosphere is better for the day.. Decent amount of TVs, service is alright.. No major complaints.."}
{"text":"I have really enjoyed this place after work and at lunch! The operation and bar staff is solid, they have a phenomenal beer selection, and friendly wait staff.   The food was surprisingly good. Honestly I expected the typical bar food, but I have had the ahi tacos, the fish and chips, crab cakes, and all have been deliciously prepared.  :)  Each time I'm in town, I try to stop by once and enjoy WOB. Gotta build up my loyalty points"}
{"text":"This place is a complete joke. I was there on a Saturday night and there was only 1 bartender working. I ordered a Red Monk, a WOB original, and the server didn't even know what it was. It took the server 10 minutes to let me know that they couldn't make the drink because they didn't have a Belgian Quad. I witnessed the bartender struggle to break a large bill for another customer while holding up a handful of other people waiting to order at the bar. Very subpar service."}
{"text":"Food was alright. Tacos looked better than what they tasted. Margarita flatbread was worth the $5.00."}
{"text":"It wasn't very busy on our Saturday evening visit.  That should've been my clue.    We weren't extremely hungry so my better half and I decided to share a few appetizers.  Our first choice was the Green Chili Chicken Nachos.  Pretty decent coverage of toppings including cheese, black beans and jalapeños.  The menu says it's supposed to be spicy cheese but I didn't catch any of the zing.    We also shared the Beer-brined Crispy Chicken Sliders.  I would not order these again.  Very very dry and lacking any flavor.  The IPA sauce was non existent.  There was maybe a dab which you couldn't taste.  It's unfortunate.    Our service from Rachel was really good.  She was very attentive and friendly.  Although the service was good, the food needs some improvement."}
{"text":"Whaaaaa!?! Dogfish head 120 oon tap!?! Modern Times city of the sun on tap!? I could go on,  but y'all would get really bored of me listing hard to find beers that you can find here.    So they aren't like other tap houses that have 100s of beers( where most of the beers include bud,  bud light, Miller light etc. And the IPA list ends at lagunitas You know what I mean?). They actually have 100s of beers that you really can't get anywhere else in Vegas.    The atmosphere is cool and friendly.  The service is great,  and they offer a great menu as well.    Please don't get turned off that they're in a mall.  WOB has an amazing beer program and I'm super fucking impressed."}
{"text":"Had a nice day here until I came back at night and was accused of walking out on my tab earlier that same day. I closed out with my waitress in cash. I grabbed a manager and told him about the situation and I pointed out the waitress to him he then opened her book and she was pocketing all cash transactions. I then checked my bank and my card was ran for the bill I already paid in cash. I had to call my bank and have the transaction cancelled. I was not offered an apology nor was the waitressfired. I will never go to this place again."}
{"text":"Went by for first time on an early Friday night. Great and fast service. Excellent beer choices. Probably had the best pretzel I've ever eaten. Spend the extra money and get the beer cheese."}
{"text":"Since the wife loves her beers we stopped here when we were visiting family. We started with big ass pretzel and tator tot dish...both were pretty damn good! I stuck with the bbq chicken flatbread and it was alright, nothing to drool over like the appetizers we got! Wifey loved her beer, and her tacos. Next time we're in town we will stop by for a couple of those pretzels!"}
{"text":"I have only been here twice and had a decent time both trips. To address some of the things people have a problem with:  Expensive - For Cleveland? Kinda. But go have that Hitachio Nest in Tokyo and come talk to me. It's all relative and you are bound to find legitimately more expensive beers when the bar is bringing in quality beer from a far away land. And some beer just costs more to make Also, it is not always the bar jacking things as we have a three tier distro system in Ohio, so many palms get greased.  Bring yo own food - can be an inconvenience I guess but I rather like it... lets the place focus on what they do best. And there are many many places to bring from in Lakewood.  Service - That is a problem and the reason for only three stars. it can be slow even when the place is half empty.  Selection can be good to great. I have had some rare-ish brew from Jackie O's here that I have not seen outside of Athens. All in all a pretty good place. I figure some other peeps do not dig this place because it is a chain. I really couldn't care less about that if they are serving up good beer..."}
{"text":"Awsome beer selection and nice atmosphere, service was pretty good.   Only downside is that it is kinda expensive for beer.  Overall a fun place to grab drinks"}
{"text":"This place has a wide selection of beers and a nice atmosphere. There is a small outdoor section and decent seating capacity for the size of the bar. They have a full compliment of flat screen TVs in case you came to watch a game and have a beer. The food they have is good, but the menu is small. This is definitely not a place to take the kids (not an environment issue, there's just nothing on the menu for them). The staff was pleasant and made the experience enjoyable."}
{"text":"World of Beer was a pretty awesome place.  Their beer selection was great. There was a lot to choose from (more so bottled and canned of course).  If you like beer and know a little bit about it on your own you would do well here.  The service was so-so and it was very disappointing that the bartender did not really know anything about the menu or the beers that he was serving (however, he was really nice).  The menu also had a few flights on it and the seasonal was not available.  The bartender gave no recommendations in place of the flight that was not available.  The place did not serve any food so the knowledge of their beers and service should have been great.  If I went back to AZ I would definitely go back and have some more brews!"}
{"text":"World of Beer is... good. Just not great.  The pro is that they have a crazy selection of beer, and the staff seems well educated on almost all of them.   The con is that it just isn't a great environment in which to enjoy those beers. There are some small seating areas, and the bank valut is neat, but for the most part it is just packed, standing room only.  If I'm going somewhere that has a hard to find, quality craft beer, I'm not going to want to swig it quickly while bum-to-bollocks with a large crowd. I want to go with friends to talk and enjoy that beer at a nice pace. That's just tough to do at WoB.  Good on them for promoting craft and speciality beers, but beer is a social beverage, and the social part of their equation is a bit lacking."}
{"text":"Okay, I'm bring this down from 5 stars after going back but I still stand by the fact that the one star reviews are overkill. It's not THAT expensive and the selection is still awesome. I know a decent amount about beer but I always like to learn more so that's a plus about this place. Also, I still think the food options are cool.  We brought our own food last time and that was awesome.   My issue, which is bringing it down a bit, is that there aren't many tables for the space. They could almost double the number of tables in here. And this place gets packed early, so they really should.   Also, the service was awesome when they first opened but it was straight up bad last time. We weren't waiting for food so it wasn't that inconvenient but our waitress just seemed way overworked. She was trying her best but couldn't keep up. It was a bit annoying but I'm willing to beileve that they were just understaffed that night. I'm hoping this won't be the case every night!   I still say this place is a great concept, music is awesome, beer slection is fantastic."}
{"text":"Staff is very friendly and helpful when it comes to beer choices. Wednesday night trivia is a great time and their shrimp tacos are always something I look forward to when I'm able to get over there."}
{"text":"The beer selection and convenient location are why we have come in the past, but I don't know if those are enough to encourage another return. The service started out great when they first opened this location last year- everyone  seemed genuinely happy to have you in and offered a sample or two of the beers before you decided. We even had some regular familiar faces that remembered us too, and that's always nice. Unfortunately,  the last few times we have always had a different server and they've all had just the hint of an attitude. Save it for Scottsdale,  this is a small beer bar in Gilbert, give me a break. The last few times I would qualify the service as mediocre at best, as well. Really slow on asking for refills or checking on you at all for that matter.   The pretzel here is really good though,  I like both the mustard and cheese they serve it with for dipping. Its a little pricey, though, and there is an upcharge for the cheese.  I have had their flat bread before and it's nothing special to write home about.   Oh, last time I was here I ordered a margar\"ipa\" which was explained as a margarita topped with an IPA. It seemed intriguing, but unfortunately turned out to be very poorly executed. It was served in a glass the size of a whiskey tumbler, the tequila was cheap, and it cost a staggering $12! I just laughed when I got the bill because it was so outrageous.  Originally I wanted to send back the drink when I first got it (not even realizing how much it cost) but the server disappeared for about a half hour afterwards so I just dealt with it.  I started this review rating 3 stars, but as I have been writing I have concluded there is nothing here that warrants a rating higher than 2 anymore. It's a shame, because it used to be so much better.  Edit: after scanning other reviews rating WOB similarly,  I actually found one that included a response from the owner in reference to someone's complaint about having a basic/limited menu. The owner offered an apology and a promise that a new one is on its way. I found this odd as a staggering number of the reviews rate low because of the poor/inattentive service,  yet no response or concession has been made by the owner toward this aspect (from what I have seen.) It just seems really weird to clearly hold an online presence, yet not actually respond to what seems to be a [more serious] recurring problem with the business. Anyway...."}
{"text":"Abbi gave me great reccomendations and the service was awesome! Great food and good atmosphere."}
{"text":"WOB is an awesome place! They have sooooooo many choices and they offer great make-your-own-flights if you want to try a bunch of them! The prices are very reasonable. They do not offer food but huge kudos to them because they offer a menu of places nearby that will deliver to you. This includes amazing choices like Greek Isles, etc. in addition to the typical pizza/sub options. It is a great atmosphere for some weekend day drinking."}
{"text":"Beer selection here is great!! It's a fun place with good seating the wait staff are all friendly! Only problem I have is the service is so slow everytime I've gone and it's extremely dark inside. But if you're not in a hurry and its warm enough to sit on the patio it's a fun place to go with friends and try some unique beers also the challenges you can complete to win free appetizers is a really fun idea!"}
{"text":"If you want to learn about and try different kinds of beer from all over the world, this is your place. It doesn't have a party atmosphere, but it doesn't boast one, either - and that's totally fine with me! I just wanted to try all different kinds of drinks without paying a whole lot, and they delivered on this.  Doing one of the Flights is a good way to try different beers. For $8-$10, you can try 4 different beers, pretty much anything on the menu. Their \"shots\" are also pretty good (they're in parentheses, because there is no way I could take those as shots! they're drink size!), and they have interesting cocktails that include beers in the recipes. I really liked the Rotten Apple Shot, the one with Fireball whiskey and RumChata (can't remember the name), Hava Blue beer, and several others that I just wouldn't be able to name unless I saw them. Overall though, a stellar deal for trying all kinds of stuff!  Their food is really good, too! And that's not usually the case with beer food. My husband had the wings, and they were soooooooo yummy! I had the beer-battered shrimp. Someone at the table next to us has mac n cheese that looked really good, and everyone that had food as happy with their dish.  Our server was also super friendly and knowledgeable, and patient when we were indecisive!  Summary? If you want to try all kinds of beers and eat yummy appetizers in a relaxed environment, this is the place!"}
{"text":"Ok, so this is one awesome little pub/brew restaurant chain!!.. came in on a late evening Sunday, caught their reverse happy hour.. amazing tap list with select taps on HH including local.. margarita flatbread was just right, drizzled with balsamic drizzled arugula.. very nice touch!! Flat screens, high tops, booths, sofas, patio, bar area.. everything you may need sans gaming or pool table.. young, new waitress was most gracious with samples and frequent enough check-ins.. Mother Earth Primordial DIPA and pFriem Helles lager on draft.. manager checked-in with the assist.. THX WOB, we'll be back"}
{"text":"My (wait for it) mortgage broker and I headed on over today for some food, beer, and financial planning.  In my opinion, this place has a FANTASTIC atmosphere. The music, seating, lighting, people, and open patio all made for quite a relaxing, fun experience. Our waitress was super-attentive and very sweet.  Their draft beer selection was pretty broad, though a bit more narrow, and a tad bit more pricey than Hopcat's. (I just assume here that Hopcat is the gold standard with which every Madisonian is familiar) When you add in the hundreds of different bottled brews in the fridge, WoB is truly worthy of calling itself a World of Beer.  You can get all the typical Bar & Grill food here; Nothing's really \"crazy good\" about the food or menu, although the Chicken Nachos were pretty tasty.  Great place to come hang out - In a city of good food, having good food is average. 3 stars here. The environment makes it great. 5 star service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"They have great beer and food but the service is kind of slow. I came here at least 6 times, our drinks come fast but our food orders would come out separate by like 20 minuets at a time. Mostly it's the food service that takes a while. I just don't like it when half the table gets the food they ordered and the other half has to wait to get their food at least 20 minuets. By the time the first half of our group would finish eating the food for the second half would come out. And it happened 4 out of the 6 times we went so..... we stopped going."}
{"text":"This was my first experience at world of beer. The manager, Darrel, gave so many good suggestions of beers to my taste. Seriously, tell him what u like and he'll point u in the right direction. Overall great experience here"}
{"text":"Had the worst first experience on Tuesday (20th june) evening. 35 mins for 3 tacos and fries. 25 mins for a beer then 30 mins for 1 more taco. The only reason for my 4 star review is due to going back Wednesday 21st (afternoon) and having great service by the female bartender on shift. This would have been a 1 star review if it wasn't for better staff during the day"}
{"text":"The first time my friend and I visited, the place was completely packed, and we turned around and went elsewhere. We tried again a few days later, and we were not disappointed by our visit! The bartender Kelly (the Hulk) was friendly, attentive, and she had an overall great knowledge of the vast drink selection.  The shrimp tacos were delicious, and helpful in soaking up a few drinks. My only gripe is that some of the staff lack communication, not only with each other, but with the customers. My friends and I recently visited and it took the waitress three tries to get our bills squared away -- and even then I was accidentally charged twice without being told of the mistake."}
{"text":"Really glad to find this place, even if it is a chain and in a mall. Both times I've been, I've have had GREAT food. Steak sandwich was melt in your mouth good and so was one of the flatbreads...not typical bar food. Patio is lovely. Outdoor bar for the smokers. Huge place. Great beer list. Great happy hour prices. Very personable service. There is an app that will keep track of your beers for ya. Live music on the weekends; let's hope it gets better than the depressing dude they had Oct 1 weekend."}
{"text":"This place has a nice atmosphere and the live music was good!! Great beer selection! Service was slow and had to send my burger back because it was well done instead of medium-rare like I ordered. After waiting 10 minutes to ask them to fix it I had to flag down another waitress because our waiter was no where to be found. Worth a second try  8/26/2017 Been back a couple more times. Wait staff much better!!! Food coming out at ordered"}
{"text":"A great place for mature people 25 and older to enjoy a drink with good music."}
{"text":"Pros- The beer selection and staff  Cons- just about everything else. Beers (12 oz) cost anywhere from $5-10, the loyalty card is pretty much a joke, and it gets pretty FRATastic on the weekends."}
{"text":"Love this place. The classic cheeseburger is the best!!! Friendly staff and overall, great service! Never disappointed."}
{"text":"Mediocre service and beer... steak sandwich was okay, but have been waiting 15 min for my check with 15 people here.  Ordered a Urduell Pilsner which was okay, but they served it look work."}
{"text":"The wife and I were meeting a group of friends for a New Belgium Brewing event here on 6/28/12.  First impression was that the place was much more spacious than I thought based on the online pictures.  We were lucky enough to get a good size table for our group since we were there early.  Very good to great selection of beer, but they do seem to have a lot of local/NC beers on tap, which takes away from them truly having beers from around the world.  That being said, they do have a lot of bottled beer with a worldwide representation.  The variety did not make a difference this evening as we mostly drank New Belgium beers due to the event, and I only drank their awesome sour beer called Tart Lychee.  Atmosphere was nice.  It certainly got louder as the evening progressed, especially with the band playing, but they played some good music.  Service was great throughout the night, even with our server being more and more busy.  Parking is somewhat of an issue, but we easily got street parking and it is near the light rail station.  They do not serve food but there was a food truck parked outside and they do allow you to get outside food and bring it in to eat while you drink their beer.  The food truck was The Herban Legend and it was awesome food, please see separate review.  I will certainly drop by World of Beer again whenever I am in this part of Charlotte."}
{"text":"I have been to WOB a few times over the Summer, great spot. Recently, I heard they had a wine selection added, but no bueno. Stick to the beers for sure. The wines are not great quality and 4 reds/whites to choose from.  If you are not a huge beer fanatic, like me its a great place to try a small sample of what you may like. Pretty cool happy hour venue."}
{"text":"Beer lovers rejoice. Great beers in a great atmosphere. That is if you like college town nights. Beer was good and the tater tot appetizer was pretty good. This world of beer was definitely worth visiting and I will return next time I visit Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Street tacos are bomb and Jeremiah is full of energy and knowledgeable. Everything he recommended was awesome"}
{"text":"Festive with a deep beer list. Great set up if you like live bands delivering music from up on high while drinking micro brews. Lots of tv's and pretty good selection of Az brews."}
{"text":"This is the best bar on mill for a few reasons.  First, best selection of beer in town.  They have a beer for any sort of palate and mood.  The ever changing selection is awesome, especially since they have collaborations with San tan, mud shark, four peaks, sleepy dog, and the other az breweries.   People who are complaining about the prices, first grow up. Second it's a bar so of course you can get these beers for cheaper at tops, so go there and sit at home, and don't slam a business on yelp for that.  You won't get mixed drinks and food here. So bros and sororistitues go home.  The bartenders and servers known thy beers and hustle to make sure you get a great beer and will ask if you wanna try something new, which is awesome.  Long story short, if you love craft beer and like to expand your palate and mind come here. If you like to close your mind and love coors light go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I've passed by here frequently and it looked promising.  Decided to visit it on a Saturday night.  They picked a really good house band to play live music with a Hootie and the Blowfish kind of feel.  When we got there, the place was buzzing with people playing cornhole and lots of people sitting around talking or playing jenga.  Overall the ambiance was nice and clean and the staff was friendly, but the prices were higher than I expected.  I didn't feel like drinking much and did want to try a few beers so I opted to get a flight of four beers of my choice.  It ended up being $15!  I'm used to paying around $6-8 at the local breweries, so it seemed pretty steep to be paying double.  I would go back with out of towner guests if we wanted a nice, chill place to have a drink, but I don't anticipate this becoming a regular spot because I can definitely find cheaper, comparable places to drink around town."}
{"text":"Eh! ? It's like so many of the others in town. I wouldn't plan to go there while there are already lots to choose from. Food was ok, beer  cold good! Ice cold glasses would be nice (if they don't have them already). Maybe stop there during shopping. We usually go to Red Robbin. The jury is still out on this one...."}
{"text":"Been awhile since I had been there, but now they added alcohol and food, so this is now officially a normal bar - another corporate sellout caving in to make more money.  It's not a bad thing, but it was better when they were different than the rest and I'm sure the free pizza sunday's are done (they are cause I was there today). Also gone is the $3 beer of the month. Bartenders are still nice and all NFL games were on TV and it wasn't crowded either. Really enjoyed the moment when the Cowboys choked at the end and the bartender, who was yelling for dallas victory a few minutes earlier, didn't say a word for the next 30 minutes. How bout them Cowboys?"}
{"text":"SO MANY BEERS! I am a huge fan of beer and this place has something for everyone. My first time here I wasn't impressed, the servers had no knowledge of the beers and they forgot our order because they didn't write it down. I decided maybe it was just an off day so went back again. Seeing how there are an overwhelming amount of choices I asked the server for a seasonal recommendation, unfortunately she did not know what I was talking about. Based on her response I knew it was up to me to put together a seasonal \"flight\". After taking our orders ( and not writing them down) the server returned to tell us they were out of most of the beers we had selected. Not a problem, us beer guys always have a backup order for situations like this. After taking our order again (without writing it down) she returns to...take our order again...(she forgot). You can imagine the frustration, with a name like world of beers one would expect someone to know a thing about beer. There's still no food and the customer service is questionable. The place has great potential with the right management and staff, its clear that complacency has taken over.Much like many of the other bars on Mill ave, this one caters to mostly college students."}
{"text":"Hated it from the moment we stepped foot on the patio.  Very little seating inside and out.  Staff utterly rude.  Some drunk jerk pushed his way practically on top of me to order bartender could care less he preferred to help drunk pig over me waiting who was already waiting patiently.  We said forget walked out.  Both husband and I agree not our style.  We prefer Gordon Biersch.  Will never go back."}
{"text":"Love this place- super fun atmosphere - Great for large groups.  The tater tots I can eat all day ( do not tell my trainer ).  The wings are amazing.  And the beer selection well its all in the name."}
{"text":"We tried this pub out and weren't disappointed! We came on a Tuesday night and had excellent food and service! Our server's name was Kazton and he rocked!  He gave us great advice on both the beer and food items. Kazton really took care of us!  The establishment was clean and fun; two good things in any pub! The prices on the food were OK and since most of the beer is imported, the beer prices were acceptable.  I would recommend to family and friends."}
{"text":"Went to this place on a Sunday afternoon, it was pretty busy and service was super slow. I think the waitress was overloaded with tables and the only one on. I've been here before and the food was good. I ordered a sour beer that was good, and our waitress suggested I try another one- which I did and liked it a lot. Will be back when hopefully they are staffed to not overloaded."}
{"text":"The waiter service was good and I would recommend the Malibu Mule for a twist on the traditional mule. They have outdoor patio, but unfortunately patrons are allowed to smoke despite the close proximity to other people."}
{"text":"Beer, beer, beer, Wow! What a great selection. I really love the fact this place has so many different beers to try. They even have these things called flights where you can get 4 5 ounce beers for $8. Not to shabby. The place is not to big, but it is very clean and nice.  The downside, it has no food and just has takeout menus. Maybe they should invest in some food trucks. Also the waiters don't carry pens and paper. So when my group of 3 people were ordering 3 rounds of flights he had to keep running back and forth to the register. That really bugged me."}
{"text":"WarRRrRioOoOrrRrSss, GO DUBS! Yes, I got to watch my hometown team win the championship and beat the dumb dumb Cavaliers here! So of course this place is going to have a special place in my heart. Lol.   With the World of Beer being my first bar/restaurant as a new resident of Henderson, I would have to give this place a solid 4 Stars. Location, location, location! WOB can be located in the galleria mall, with the entrance from the outside of the mall. They have an outdoor patio over looking the hillside to the south. The indoor eating area is nice and spacious which offers many TVs to watch sports events!   When we were seated right away on one of the high tops tables in the bar area, our awesome server- Marissa was on it and took our bevie orders right away! Thanks for the awesome hospitality Marissa!   So it's quite clear that if you're a beer lovahhh, this place is all you boo! They offer a plethora of beer options. With my preference being SOURs, it was hard for me to decide which one I wanted so I hoped for a sour beer flight. I loved all of them!   For foods, we hit up the happy hour menu which offered great items! We tried the barbacoa beef tacos, the chicken tacos, the fried Mac n' Cheese, the wings (naked, ofcourse!) with a side of the Korean spicy dipping sauce!   All this food plus beers was the perfect setting while watching the Golden State Warriors basketball game. I was in heaven! The happy hour options here are delicious and reasonably priced.   Cool atmosphere; delicious food? I would totally come back for more delicious sour beers!"}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed in the slightest. Although the beer choices were good the food was mediocre. Our waiter was great but they seemed very short staffed as it wasn't even that busy and he was running around the entire place, I felt bad for him. It's nothing I'd want to even try to go back for a second chance"}
{"text":"Having tried a sister property in Orlando we were excited to find this opening in Las Vegas. The location is only convenient if you live in this part of the city. While we do not we aren't fully able to enjoy the place as often or for as long as we'd like. Food is awesome. Definitely recommend the pretzel with the beer cheese. Have tried many options on the menu and have yet to be disappointed (burgers, flatbread pizzas, salads etc). The beer selection is amazing. If you do a sampler they will customize your selections based on your palate preferences. Even better- if you don't like one of their choices they will exchange it- no questions asked. Service is very friendly. The owner is awesome and makes sure to greet each customer at some point. Supposedly more locations are coming to Las Vegas which would be perfect!  Make it more convenient and I'll up the review to 5-stars!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Went here yesterday and I was so glad we chose to come here. Didn't realize that we were there for almost 5 hours just drinking,eating and chatting away.  Atmosphere: very chill. The setting is family friendly as well. They have couches. Some games on the patio that you can do. Pretty awesome!  Service:  our server was excellent. She was very attentive and she was always there when we needed her. if she wasn't around,  other servers, hostess and other staff made sure that we were doing ok and had everything we wanted/need. My friends came here with their toddler and the staff was so sweet playing with him.  Food and drinks: food are reasonable price and it's really good. Not greasy, perfect proportion. I liked what we ordered (which was burger) beers! Beers! Beers! I love it. They give you an iPad and you can view all the beers they have from all over the world; hence world of beer! Lol! Price is good too. You can sample all of them if your not sure what to get.  It's a must go place if you just want to relax. Away from the crowd on the strip! Good job Henderson for having this place!"}
{"text":"The cioppino was the very best I've tasted. The sauce was so vibrant!!! I had the spinal fruit salad. Didn't like the tangy lemon vinaigrette. And didn't like the goat cheese. Gonna have to change that next time. Had a margherita flatbread, each square slice had a tomato! Yummy and southwest egg rolls with herb sauce. It was very tasty."}
{"text":"If you love beers this is the place to go so many crafted beers. Happy hour is pretty dope too $4 droughts, $5 spirits, and $5 shareables. This place is a true gem located next to Gen KBBQ at galleria mall. They have an awesome staff that knows there beer. Outside seating if you wanna enjoy that fresh air. Love, love love the set up of this place cool, hip, and modern. TV surrounding the place to watch the games. Austin my man great service cool vibes and always constantly checking up on you. You don't get that too often from Bartenders. Definitely recommend for a cool spot to chill and hang out."}
{"text":"Not bad, I tried the Mead(8%). Served in a little wine glass. Cool Place!"}
{"text":"Awesome little spot visiting from NY, this had all the right feats to keep there customers happy. Great hang out spot for a bunch of friends to play some games, throw a few cold ones back and enjoy the laid back atmosphere. Great selection of beer on tap and in bottles, well priced delicious bar food, and games to play, what more is there to ask for?   Stay fat mother suckers"}
{"text":"I stop in on father's day I got served quickly at the bar with a free father's day beer. Everything went downhill from there. I ordered breakfast and it took 30 minutes to get to me I had some friends join me and we moved to a table. We sat in a booth for 30 minutes and a waiter never stopped at our table so we left. It's to bad the service is so bad at world of beer because the food and the beer selection are pretty good."}
{"text":"Went here to watch a football game and had their brand of root beer called Not your father's beer and it was really good. I love root beer and it was great! They have specials during the week so will definitely return. All of the servers were very friendly too."}
{"text":"Fool me once, shame on you... Fool me twice, well I should have known better. Poor service here as I have come to learn, beers come out in groups warm, waitresses lack knowledge and personality, overpriced menu with little options. With Gordon B around the corner I don't know how this place survives. After repeat poor experiences I can promise I won't be back."}
{"text":"A spot that I visited with my cousin while on my tour of Chandler and Gilbert. I was told this place had a ton of beers to check out. So we came to kick ass and chew bubble gum....and we were all out of bubble gum.   Place is a nice cool sports bar with a ton of taps you can take on. They range from IPA's, Stouts, Belgians, Porters and more. So you can really cover all your basis for any beer drinker out there. There food here is ok, I tried the sliders and the flat bread. Nothing to go to crazy about with what I had. Although the pretzel and beer cheese is a must get. Its massive and the beer cheese and mustard are a great pairing with any brew you are sipping.   Not a bad spot that I can image on football Sundays can get packed. They have TVs everywhere and keep the place nice and cool. They had some crazy beer while I was there from Dogfish Head called Choc-Lobster. It's a porter infused with cocoa and lobster that is added to the brew boil. It was weird but cool to try. CHEERS!!"}
{"text":"An animal rescue group I support held a fundraiser here in Feb 2014, and the owners promised to donate a portion of what was raised back to the rescue. Instead they kept all of the money. Very shady and we will not return!"}
{"text":"It's like Buffalo Wild Wings minus the wings. Well, yeah, and more beer. Barely.    At 4pm on a Thursday three friends and I found an empty table (shocking in a place that likely seats fewer people than The Grind).   After roughly ten minutes at the table one of my friends finally got up and asked a waitress for menus. As there were probably 25 people working, it wasn't hard to find somebody to ask. Strange since not one of them had been over to us yet.  She wasn't given a bottle list, which apparently is a claim to fame for them, but we got to look over their taps and a list of local eateries that are willing to deliver.  Hmm, no thanks on that idea.  The taps were a disappointment. A large variety of over priced local offerings, some mediocre imports (Colorado and Oregon make great beer but having Dead Guy on your tap isn't risque). Not even a single sour.   At this point we were getting pretty thirsty. A timer was set for 15 minutes. If a server didn't ask us for an order we were outta here.  The server did finally show up. She talked to the other party taking up the rest of the room. I leaned into my group and told them that watch, this girl wasn't going to even *allow* us to make eye contact. She was going to get their bill straight, ignore us, and split.   Exactly what happened. She literally kept her back to us the *entire* time she was in the room.     On the way out I asked a server if the room we were sitting in offered wait service, or if the customers were expected to walk to the bar to order a beer. Again, without eye contact, she said yeah the room has service, and then turned her back to me and stared at her notepad.    This isn't their first location. A company with as many outlets as these guys have should open with servers who know how to carry one-single-product from point A to point B.   Rude servers. Maybe not all of them, but I wouldn't know. After the three I dealt with here I won't ever deal with a fourth.  Lackluster tap list. If you want good taps go to Taste of Tops or Brat House, or a smaller spot like TMI.   No food. Having deliveries doesn't count.   Big Business Chain. While the owners want you to think its an edgy, tattoo'd and hip local spot for cool kids, it's not."}
{"text":"Was here in Monday April 4 at 11:15am. There were two in or party and we were waiting on the third person to arrive. As we walked up we noticed there were about 10 older men outside on patio with menus. As we entered we waiting to see if we had to be sat but after a few minutes of not seeing anyone we sat ourselves. There were also about 10 men seated inside as well. We thought it must be a group of guys who come here each week or something and we understood they were there and service might not be the fastest, especially since only a few of them had drinks.  We sat for about 10 minutes before we were even acknowledged. Our friend had not even arrived yet. Like I said we were not in a hurry.  The male server comes up to us, clearly bothered by us. No hello, no menus! First words out his mouth were \"I'm going to just be real with you, I'm the only one here and I have this huge group and the kitchen is already behind\" - we said ok, were waiting for someone and not in a hurry so we were ok - he literally rolled his eyes and said he would be back to take our drink order. After my friend and I looked at each other in shock we got up and walked out. 1. Why was he the boy one working - poor management 2. They had just opened 20 minutes prior, men were still getting their drinks - how was kitchen backed up 3. Server was completely rude  4. Place seemed dirty, table was sticky  Won't ever go back!"}
{"text":"I would rate this place a 4.5 Great food and beer. The happy hour is kick ass! Very clean and comfortable.  I love how the bar opened up next to the patio. The bartender was great and very knowledgeable.  The brat was big and juicy and delicious! The ipad list lists all the types and prices of beer without having to ask the bartender.   The only downer was when I walked into the place the host was yakking to some guy with grey hair and both ignored me as i stood there. I just went and seated myself at the bar. The host could be more attentive."}
{"text":"Poor service. Extremely high prices! Insane pricing yet on yelp they say \"$$ Price range Moderate.\" Yea right. Let me say it's most definitely $$$$ Price range Very High."}
{"text":"Their giant pretzel, wide varieties of beer, live entertainment, and a super friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection. Horrible service. Like, really bad. If waiting 15 minutes for your beer is the kind of thing you are into then this is the place for you!!"}
{"text":"I'm a craft beer novice but they have an extensive beer selection. Drinkers should be pleased or satisfied. The bartenders are very helpful with suggestions and samples.  The main problem with this place is the parking. You can hope to snag one of the handful of street spots or head to parking deck in connected apartment complex. I think you can park there. It's not exactly clear where else you can safely leave your car."}
{"text":"This place was good. I'd honestly give it a three because of my barely cold, skunk line Blue Moon beer on tap BUT my fish tacos were awesome.   We stopped in on a Sunday evening and the place was pretty busy but we got a table with no problem. We were met by staff very quickly and given menus. I ordered a Blue Moon on tap and my bros asked for an IPA recommendation. The waiter, bless his heart brought them some pineapple beer that wasn't even close to an IPA lol  Anyway the savior of the restaurant for me were the Mahi Mahi tacos. Perfectly cooked fish with I believe blackened spice on them with coleslaw and house made tarter sauce. Delicious! My bros got the wings and steak. Both were good according to them. We all shared some Mac n cheese bites that were very good as well.   I'd recommend this place. Their food is good(get the Mahi Mahi tacos!) and the beer selection is impressive. Go beyond Blue Moon though lol They have well over 100 beers in cans/bottles in case you don't want to risk skunk tap line"}
{"text":"Here's the rundown.  50 beers on tap, and over 100 beers in bottles.  That's it.  No booze.  No food.  They conveniently give you the phone numbers to some of the local restaurants to call if you need food, or you can even just make a picnic basket and bring you own from home.  The menu does a GREAT job of classifying the beers by both origin and by type so you can easily find your favorites, or try something brand new.  The biggest problem I've had with this place is the noise level.  They have live music quite often, but it's to the point where you are going to have to yell at the person you're with if you plan on having any sort of conversation."}
{"text":"First off, I still enjoy this place.  I like the way it looks, the way it feels, and in general it is a cool place to hang out.  The servers are nice and the drinks, especially on happy hour, are reasonable and good.  I am deducting a point however based on the food.  I have tried many different items here and it has all just been mediocre at best.  It's weird when you have a full menu with unique items and the pretzel is still one of the better items, along with the chimichurry meatballs, although not in slider form...I feel like the food should be miles ahead but it just isn't.  It's just there so you don't get hammered and that a shame because with such a diverse menu, I feel like they could be on the same level as Yardhouse but they can't compete when it comes to their food in taste, quality, and size.  The service although friendly, is a bit slow though so WOB is getting a slight deduction for that as well.    All being said, still come and check this place out.  It's not open as late as I would like but then maybe that's a good thing because I would probably stay here too long chatting and having a good time."}
{"text":"MY husband and I were in Tempe in July and saw WOB under construction. We went back in September and yes, the place was crowded but it had a great Vibe.....Great selection of beer  and great service....wish they had one here."}
{"text":"Absolutely a very extraordinarily nice place, you'll be more than happy to take your special lady. Be sure to check out the beverage. Don't rush this one, you'll be returning soon. They cater to  special times for family and of course friends."}
{"text":"The name says it all- it's a world of beers, I had to get a flight because there were too many great choices! . Plenty of options on the food menu too. We had happy hour specials and a pesto chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"Went last Thursday night to stop in and check out the new bar.  Super busy, probably because it was the opening week.  Not a lot of seating to go around.  I ended up snagging a little portion of a booth, and accidentally put my arms on the table.  Got caked on beer all over my arms, super sticky.  Menu of beers was super impressive.  I would have enjoyed some sort of sampler flight but it was way to busy at the bar to order without spilling it all over the place with people packed in three or four deep from the bar.   They also had live music which was nice where you could see the band on the second floor.   Crowd was college aged due to being right next to the college as expected.  I might want to try this place during the daytime in order not to feel crammed in.   Beer size was an issue with myself as others have stated, for the price you pay.  Also to bad no bar food,  I like to snack and enjoy my beers."}
{"text":"They have a variety of draft beers to choose from (obviously). Their bathrooms are cleaner than the hotel room I rented *thumbs up*. The staff/bar tenders are super friendly and willing to give as many samples needed to choose the next beer :)"}
{"text":"Huge selection of both bottled and draft beers. Changing craft beer specials all the time.  This place is great!  I have never NOT been able to get a beer I was craving which is worth 5 stars alone.  I am usually here when traveling on business so I come here by myself which is fine because it is the type of fun place to order a few beers and then sit out on their small patio right along Mill Ave. and people watch.  Very relaxing and cool.   I have never ordered food and don't know if they even have a grill.  Bartenders are always helpful with beer choices.  If you are a beer lover, highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"They had a few ciders on tap, which made me happy. Also had some bottles. Beer selection is good. Can't say much more as Charlotte has a lot of good places to find great beers now and wob just isn't convenient for me."}
{"text":"Stopped in after doing a bit of shopping at the mall. Had a chimay burger, asked for medium, came out well. Had fries with it. 12 fries, I don't think I've ever ever ever counted the number of fries because the portions never looked like I was missing half my order. Husband ordered the Guinness dog.  It was just ok. I was put off by the older man, maybe the manager, walking around. The reason is the way he talked to the servers. He was pushy, not aggressive but just like barking at them in a condescending way. I felt bad for the servers. Perhaps he should reconsider his presence on the floor or be more aware of his tone and actions.    Husband ordered his first beer, came out in a snifter. When he asked the waitress for a recommendation for an IPA in a pint, she said let me get the list, I've got 7 tables, I'm really busy.  Overall totally not impressed."}
{"text":"Come here and ask for John. He had a great knowledge of what was on tap and was energetic and quick to check back with us. Great vibe inside of here and they have great food as well! Definitely a place worth checking out if you're on Mill."}
{"text":"5 stars for trivia and a good time with friends. 4 stars for happy hour menu. 3 stars for food and service. Nuff said. I will say that the beer cheese pretzel is a good order, just based up on the size of the entire thing! The flatbread pizza is okay, a good buy for the happy hour price and food, but everything else is typical bar food that is just okay.   Happy Trivia Guessing!"}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere, staff, beer and food. What else do you need to watch the games?! I will definitely be back again many times now that I'm part of the loyalty program! If you're looking for a new place to try, this place is a must!"}
{"text":"I found myself, along with some friends, wandering the streets of Tempe, after a University of Washington v. Arizona State loss. We found a quick table available at the World of Beer, and were really attracted to the place based on some online reviews attacking the owner. But, we wanted to check it out for ourselves. Great service, pretty much. And when it wasn't great service and we let them know, we were comp'd our appetizer, thanks! Go Dawgs!"}
{"text":"This is a cool bar with a nice decor and vibe. I checked in on yelp and received a free beer. They gave me a choice of 5 or 6 to choose from and I picked the hefeweizen and it was really good. This free beer is huge. Like 2 or 3 regular beers.  Our bartender Fredi (female) was so great. Nice personable girl whos easy and fun to talk to. What a great experience."}
{"text":"Matt and Freddie where awesome knowledgeable and friendly bar tenders. They had a great variety of craft beers with a good amount of locals, which I liked. I will definitely return to this establishment."}
{"text":"I am so happy that WOB has made a home in gilbert! Since they opened my boyfriend and I go at least once if not twice a week. Amanda their day time bartender is always so friendly and happy to see us, she gives us great suggestions. I love that the beer is always changing, sometime almost too fast, but always gives us something new to try. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Went in for the first time since we were in the area.   This place has A LOT of beers to choose from.    If you want some different beer, this is probably the place to go.    They also will give you a sample if you want to try something.  But here is why I will not be back:   $10 for an appetizer pretzel seems pretty expensive.  Ordered a bottled beer and it was barely cold (unacceptable).  The menu advised they had the type of liquor my wife likes, but they did not (instead had a very poor substitute)-  however bill showed charge for the name brand liquor they did not have.   I get that this place has literally hundreds of beers, but why not carry at least one domestic light beer."}
{"text":"Really enjoy pints here on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon. Not real busy, staff helpful & attentive. Great beer selection, enjoyed a good run of Mad Elf &  Hop Slam. Have been there when there's live music, & it's hellish unless that's your thing. Would like to try the food thing at some point, love Cosmic Dave's."}
{"text":"This place is an international beer-lover's delight. Everything from great local brews, to top US breweries, rare belgiums, german lagers and ales, etc. Beer selection gets my A+.  Why I'm only rating it 3 stars is due to the terrible service and poor food quality. My friend and I sat at a table near the bar, and we repeatedly had to ask for water, refills, etc. It got to the point where we just went up to the bar if we needed anything. I wasn't expecting black-tie service, but as someone who has worked for a busy wine bar and who is currently in the service industry I usually fulfill my customer's requests within 15 minutes. Just sayin'.  We both ordered the wings, which were just fine, then our second round we went for the flatbread. It arrived as this lumpy rectangle topped with 5-6 questionable meat pieces, unmelted cheese, terrible marinara, and had I not been really hungry and on my 4th beer I would have sent it back.  :( I will return for additional beers, but I'll pack a granola bar with me to quell any hunger pangs..."}
{"text":"Eek.  Went in expecting a whole lot.  Yes, there is a whole lot of beer.  Lots that you may never see on tap unless you are quite traveled.  Lots that you see in the grocery every day.  Carded at the door.  This is Tempe, and it's a bar.  10 minutes until the waitress asks if we'd like a menu.  Yes.  Of course we want a menu.  You have 550 beers.  6 minutes later she brings two waters, for the four of us.  \"I forgot your menus!\".  The gents next to us hand us theirs.  4 minutes later we place an order for two beers.  I have to repeat myself 4 times.  My girlfriend repeats herself 3 times, only to have the waitress come back and confirm the beer she ordered (note: she guessed wrong!).  She then comes back to card us (remember, we were carded by two gentlemen at the door).  She leaves.  She then drops off our two beers, and a check, with no offer for a tab.  Strange.  I hand her cash, to which she brings no change back.  My two friends order two beers, and are, again, carded before being served their beers.  Their check is dropped, with once again, no offer at a tab.   We went across the street to Robbie Fox's instead of having another.  I doubt I'll be back.    + for a ton of beers, though I wonder how rotating those will go.  I have many doubts they will sell through 500 differing beers (x however many cases of each they have) before they start to get questionable.  + for some great beers on tap  - Running cards after every beer.  Not only is this annoying, but it costs your business every time you do so.  Color me confused.  - Poor service overall, from double or triple carding, to menu dropping / table touching / attentiveness"}
{"text":"Tonight was our fourth time giving WOB try. Beer selection is great service sucked. Had better service at the DMV than this place every single time. If you want beer choices.....choose somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Great service! Out of this world on the beer selection!! The food tasted great and I really liked the atmosphere as well!! Just wished it was closer to my home. I'd recommend this place for their menu, staff and definitely the beer too!!! Our server was great and did just enough-and not overbearing either!! Two thumbs way up!! We will definitely be back! Thanks World of Beer!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing selection, amazing service, and amazing chili ;)  What a great place. I was a little iffy going to a pub at a mall.  Boy was I wrong.  The gentleman serving us knew his beer. He was even honest on what beers he did not prefer and recommended an outstanding one for me based on what I liked.  Ask for samples. My wife never knew she liked infused beers.  We shared the pretzel (with cheese) and nachos (with chili). The pretzel was soft with a lovely outer crisp... and the size of my face! Plenty to share.  The Nachos never got soggy but was a little higher on the chip side of the chip-cheese ratio. But the chili was phenomenal. Hearty, not runny, and had chunks of succulent beef chunks.  All in all, this is s great place to bring a couple friends for some wonderful brews, eats, and service. Order from the shared menu, set the search list on the table-side iPad for your favorite style beer, and relax."}
{"text":"Went in hoping for a holiday type beer.. Settled for a chocolate porter/white chocolate beer & it was amazing! They call it a chocolate chip cookie on the receipt! Highly addictive!"}
{"text":"Not enough seating to enjoy the experience. They do not serve food, bad idea."}
{"text":"Went in sat at a table near the bar a guy came up who looked and acted drunk or high took our drink order and disappeared several people sat down after us and had their drink order so we moved to the bar after asking the bartender if it was because we won't getting service he said of course I'll take care of you and then he went to the bar and we sat there for another 5-6 minutes about to leave when he came over   Food was great except the meatballs which are way over cooked and have to eat so we left them when I told him he said oh well that's a shame and anyone offers new ones or take them off out bill   Overall I will try again because the food was good service sucked hopefully next time I'll get better service   I had shrimp tacos yummmm"}
{"text":"Food was really good! We had the Tavern Taters, Guinness Bratwurst, and the Flatiron steak sandwich."}
{"text":"The beer selection is obviously great. It's one of the few places I can get beers I like.   HOWEVER, the wait/bar staff is not great. They are slow, inattentive and seem to be more concerned about their side conversations than taking care of their customers. I've had friends who have been here that have experienced more than sub-par service. The last two times I've been in here I've had to wait a while for anyone to even acknowledge us. Based on other reviews, I'm not the only one who has this opinion on the staff.  To the manager: please train your staff to have a sense of urgency with your customers. Address the customer quickly and check on them more than once every 30 minutes. I've been in the service industry for YEARS and it was a shame that such a cool place had such bad service."}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of tap beer. Any type, domestic, German or micro brew.  This place is Halloween everyday for adults. Nothing but an enjoyable experience and lots of beer.  As much as I like this place, I always have to cut myself off fast. I live 10 miles away and do drive home.  If you are a LOCAL or visitor to the area. This is a real must visit location."}
{"text":"Did not care for the environment, wait or tap selection. NOT ENOUGH SEATING!   Excellent concept Horrible delivery!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure where to go with this review as it was one of the strangest dining experiences ever.  My husband ordered 2 appetizers and I ordered one. Not being a beer drinker, I was disappointed that iced tea isn't an option. I was stuck with water since I no longer drink sodas either.   Our pretzel with beer cheese arrived. The pretzel was huge. It was salted without being overdone. There was a honey mustard sauce and something that looked like thousand island. It tasted like a sausage mayo or something. When she came back we asked about the cheese. Apparently the weird pink stuff was cheese. I swear I couldn't taste the cheese at all. Weird!! Anyway, she offered to remove it from our bill which was really cool (the cheese was extra) and brought out two more mustards. So we munched on this a little then put it aside while we waited for our other items.   The place was getting pretty busy and another waitress would stop by from time to time to fill our drinks. After an hour from arrival we waived down our waitress. She had zero memory of us ordering anything else. Zero! She had never placed the order because she didn't remember we ordered them.  Needless to say, we asked for our bill. The waitress said that she was new and when things got busy she must have forgotten. I appreciated that she was honest, friendly and humble. She waived the bill completely. We really appreciated her attitude and that she didn't make excuses or try to spread blame. Because of this, we would probably try it again but it was a pretty strange experience. Two stars from me 1 for her honesty and humility and 1 for the pretzel sans cheese. Husband gives them a zero."}
{"text":"First, you got to like beer to enjoy this. Actually, you should really love beer. Luckily, my hubby and I do. A lot. I wouldn't go here for a cocktail, wine or a bud. Go here to try a beer you've never heard of before at a good price along with a decent snack.   I tried a local brewery called Hess - a wonderful Russian Imperial stout. Then I had a Belgian flight of 4 beers for $10. The Ovila Brandy Barrel Aged Stout was soooo yummy and my hubby even liked it and he's not a fan of stouts. The only downside is it was a limited run so I can't find it anywhere else.   One caveat - this place is tiny and loud. We sat outside, which helped, but there were a couple very obnoxious, loud drunk people out on the patio.   The pretzel was delicious - huge and hanging from a banana stand. Very different. And where else in the east valley can you get a scotch egg?  5 beers down, 75 to go..."}
{"text":"St Patrick's day and there were 8 people at the bar with 4 bartenders. Still waited 10 minutes for someone to serve me. Put down your phones and earn your tip. That's all we ask."}
{"text":"matt the bartender was very knowledgeable and attentive and even remembered all our names. that is an accomplishment, considering I can't even remember what I ate yesterday. The food is great, beer is better, service was astonishing!"}
{"text":"I love this world of beer.  The beertenders are usually all awesome and are very knowledgeable about the million different beers they have.  They also have their own special concoctions that are  fun to try.  Though there is no food here, you can bring your own or order from the menus that they have behind the bar. Also, what's great is on Sunday's this place is empty making it a perfect spot to enjoy some football.  Good beer and great employees what makes this place special ( even though it's a franchise)"}
{"text":"Good selection of beer but Shame about the food, Cesar salad had minimal dressing, chicken tacos was very tasteless and they sent the wings out with out any sauce on. On the positive note the sever was very nice."}
{"text":"Been here three times now. First time the beer menu was organized by style/location and the server was very helpful. Last two times they just threw an unorganized list at us. Also didn't have many local beers. Had onion rings and they were pretty bad/over cooked and my daughters sliders weren't much better. Waitress was not friendly. Disappointing because the place has a lot potential but falls short of expectations. May give it one more chance because of the number of tap handles but there are other places with better food and service in the area."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing staff!!! Super knowledgeable about what beers they provide. Sarah was our designated staff member and a wonderful one at that! We will for sure be coming back to enjoy the libations again!"}
{"text":"First time at a World of Beer and it lived up to a few years of hype! Great selection of beers, good happy hour options with delicious fried pickles, and great service from our waiter Jay. Manager on duty, Nikki, was also great to make sure we enjoyed our time. Definitely plan to come back."}
{"text":"I had the grilled salmon over the spring  and kale salad; and it was awesome. I didn't come in for that exactly; but after eating crap food all week, I decided a salad was a good choice.  Great service, cold beer, and great food, what elder do you need?"}
{"text":"The safety of the customers in this bar are put in danger by the actions of the servers and managers.  The managers elevate and fabricate false accusations based on their insecurities and wanting to impress others and their own friends.  They are very power hungry, and bully patrons.  The safety of patrons should be a bars number one priority.  I do not feel my safety is number one at this bar. I have seen cops called numerous times and multiple fights have broke out.  And these were fights the manager started!  Add that to the fowl smell of the restaurant, warm beers, and high prices...I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"When we went it was on a weekday in the day. Our visit started off well and our server was attentive. He must have gotten frazzled because long story short we never received our beers which in a place called WORLD OF BEER you kind of expect to get your beer. I was pretty angry at that. We got our food at least so that's good!  The burgers were excellent and a good deal. I don't know if I'll be back after the experience but don't let it deter ton from trying it out. I can't comment on the beer or selection because I lost out on that experience"}
{"text":"We brought a growler in to be filled and the bartender didn't tighten the cap and used masking tape to seal it."}
{"text":"The staff is exceptionally talented and helpful; they really go out of their way to help. On top of that the food is great and the beer selection is vast. I highly recommend the happy hour menu! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Cortea and Napua were great servers. Wings, street tacos and the new steak bowl were all very good. I cant believe how cheap the beer prices are here. $4 for a tall local beer, $3 for a labatt Blue! ( yes I'm an east coast guy) and for the win $5 for a kronenbourg 1664 wow that usually goes for $7-$9 depending on where you are in Vegas. Very good visit, the Bartender Matt was very knowledgeable about the bullion beers they have here as well. A+"}
{"text":"Visiting AZ for a wedding with a few hours to kill, so my brothers dropped me and Squiggly on Mill Avenue to fend for ourselves. Keep in mind that it's been YEARS since I've roamed these streets... After walking for a few we notice World Of Beer. At first glance all we could see were rows of bottles of beers , so we thought it was a liquor store. We decided to take a closer look and to our surprise it was indeed a bar. HELLA beers on tap...cute bartenders...outside patio for smoking and people watching. We had a great time and the girls were SUPER nice and helpful in letting us sample beers. Met some cool people and had a great time. Will definitely recommend this spot."}
{"text":"Took 20 minutes to close out. European bartender called me an asshole for waiting so long as he was busy doing nothing at 11pm. Needs new management. Was no one there and bartender was overwhelmed."}
{"text":"Update: After communicating with the manager, he said there were pricing issues, and that the Hop Drop and Roll was one of them.  He offered me a complimentary one, but I'm not in too much of a hurry to return.  WOB is an ok place, but the negatives outweigh the positives, and they should have had their pricing straight well before opening day.  There are just too many nearby beer places that are better, from VBGB to Common Market to Carolina Ale House to the actual breweries.  Writing fake reviews on Yelp isn't going to help their cause either."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night with the family, happy hour was on and the deals were flowing! Great atmosphere, upbeat employees and CLEAN!! Great beer menu, with a wide variety from around the world with fresh tasting food that will definitely get us to come. Jason our server was knowledgeable about the food and beer for sure. Offered suggestions that weren't stale words that the company gave to him. Insightful and detailed, Jason is the go to man here. I can't wait to come back here with the guys and watch a game."}
{"text":"Yes they have a lot of beers but it's not worth the rude staff. Go someplace else."}
{"text":"If you can snag street parking then there is nothing to complain about an outing to World of Beer. I ordered a Sweetwater Blue and they offered to throw some blueberries in the glass...do I look like the kind of girl who likes fruit in her beer? yes? Well- you are correct- give me those blueberries! Large indoor and outdoor areas - dog friendly!  You can order delivery from several area hot spots like Tavern on the Tracks and yummy Greek Isles- the bar has all the menus and during peak times delivery is free or you can walk to .1 miles to pick it up yourself. Great place to unwind with a massive beer selection that ranges from $3 specials to hit the floor after one high gravity options."}
{"text":"Color me unimpressed.  Anybody who knows me (and even some who don't) know that I love my beer. I consider myself a connoisseur, and have been called a beer snob on occasion (might have to do with my twitter handle.) With 54 taps and 500 bottles, this place certainly doesn't disappoint on the beer aspect. So why the 1 star, you might ask? With all of my high hopes for this place, it fell flat on its face in every aspect I feared it would. It was over crowded with far too little seating (we ended up standing). The music was loud enough that everybody had to practically shout and lean in towards each other to be heard. Then there was the service.  Only one other time have I ever even considered walking out on a tab. It takes a lot to get me to that point. Now while we were greeted quickly, which sounds like a rarity, this was the only good portion of the service. While my own beer arrived within only about 5 minutes, my friend's beer waited under the tap for a good 10 minutes, completely forgotten about. Of course this was only after he was told twice that the other beers he wanted were no longer available, with 5 minute gaps between each of these. At this point we decided to finish our beers and be done with this place. Little did we know, this was no easy task. Getting near the end of our beers, our server asked if we would like another round and we said, \"No we'd like to tab out.\" Simple enough. 20 minutes later, still no check. I managed to get the attention of our server again finally and held my credit card out toward her this time, hoping for a stronger hint. \"Oh, would you like to tab out?\"  I am quite certain I will not be giving this place a second chance."}
{"text":"Stopped in on 4th of July. Hip gastro pub with a huge selection of beers. Ordered a draft pale ale & Modelo especiale to drink. $5 & $6 each. Then saw the $2 & $3 draft beer specials. Wish we would have seen them earlier or the waitress had mentioned them. To eat, BF had chimichura meatball sliders w mac n cheese. I had the margarita flat bread w Caesar salad. We shared & thought both were excellent.   Service was quick, friendly & efficient. Gentleman, who we confirmed was the owner, was hands on backing the wait staff.  I would have to compliment the owner for the restaurants hip atmosphere & menu. Also for his ability to hire hustling waitresses. While it wasn't busy when we were there, I would suspect it could be often, at other times.   Overall a very pleasant dining experience. I would definitely go back & do recommend."}
{"text":"Oh no!  This is not World of Beer Tempe at all! The waitress was kind of awful.  First, I must say, I am not a fan of beer that much. I lived in Ireland (the beer capital of my life) and managed to have a beer only once. Needless to say, beer and I do not mesh very well. However, I love World of Beer because of all the different varieties and you can literally find something for anyone.  So I bring my visiting friends to World of Beer Gilbert. I'm excited to introduce them to this crazy fun little place. But if you go to World of Beer for the first time, it can kind of be overwhelming. That's why the waitress/waiter usually eases you through it - I mean they go to be classes, they're trained in beer...stuff, like, they should know how to help someone find a good beer.  All our waitress said is that the menu is good at describing the different beers and let her know if we have a question. Then she disappears. She doesn't come back until we flag her down after waiting 20 minutes to place our order.  The beer was good. The service was not.  In fact, I was embarrassed that I talked this place up so much and that's what was delivered.  World of Beer - I still have a place in my heart for you, but I highly doubt I'll be returning to this Gilbert location anytime soon."}
{"text":"Great sports bar, TV's everywhere. Good bar food. Stay with the house wine, we found out the hard way. Otherwise very good."}
{"text":"Have heard some really good things about this place, so we decided to meet up with a few friends there and check it out.  Finding a good parking spot can be challenging if you come at a busy time, there is limited parking on the street, otherwise you may have to park in the parking garage down the street and walk (not too far). The atmosphere is open and inviting. There are several high top tables, a few low top tables, and a bar with seating that wraps around the tap area, there is also a small outside patio area that has corn hole set up when the weather permits.  The service was friendly and fairly quick, and the bartender & waitstaff seemed fairly well educated on the beer selection and styles.   The don't serve food here, but they do have menus from 3 or 4 local restaurants that will deliver here. They will give you a menu and you call the restaurant and pay them, WOB doesn't try to act as a middle man for the transaction or add a fee.  Now on to the beer selection. They have about 50 taps, and 10 times as many bottles. A fairly diverse tap selection, ranging from Old Rasputin on nitro, to Boulevard 80 Acre Wheat and nearly everything in between.  Definitely a cool place to hang out and get a beer."}
{"text":"No idea why this place isn't rated higher!  Our server was amazing...she made sure the games we wanted were on and made great recommendations for beer.  The space is well designed with lots of TV's.  Wish they served some munchies, but won't hold it against them.  Nice that they had free BBQ yesterday!"}
{"text":"Spur of the moment lunch visit with a friend on a Tuesday. We were there at about 1:30 pm so missed the lunch crowd. They said they had opened about a week ago. The space looked really good. On the side of being upscale but not pretentious.   The space is wide -open with many different seating areas and seating options. They also have an outdoor seating area where the exterior wall partitions roll up into the ceiling, creating a very wide open and airy feel from inside the restaurant. They also have radiant space heaters outside. We were promptly greeted by our waitress. Apparently, they have hundreds of beers available with  many on tap and in bottles. They also serve hard liquor and have a food menu.  I thought the beer prices were pretty reasonable; food prices, little high. Beer prices range from five through seven dollars, I think, depending on the type.  They have an appetizer menu which, given prices, I assumed are sized to be shared.  Their entrée menu is not huge. They have various salads, wraps, burgers, soups and I thought I saw some fish items... All on the upscale side. Not typical neighborhood bar or tavern fare.  We ordered a pretzel which was very large and well presented. Tasty, too.  For lunch, I had the flat iron steak salad and my friend had the crab cake appetizer.  My steak slices were tender and tasty but smallish on portion for the price. The salad was nothing special and I suspect was precut and came out of a bag. I was not given a dressing option or told what was standard. I presumed it would be blue cheese. There was blue cheese chunks on the salad. They also tossed all of the greens in what tasted like a pretty flat Italian dressing.  Still, the atmosphere was very nice and our waitress was very pleasant and helpful. I'm sure the kitchen will work out the kinks.  It is definitely worth a visit for at least a few beers and some appetizers after work.  I am looking forward to revisiting."}
{"text":"My wife and I like coming here when we can. Lots of great beers to choose from and the pretzel with beer cheese is awesome. Service can sometimes be iffy but lately it's been better. I did over hear they might be closing though and if you look at the world of beer website the Arizona locations are no longer there? Hope they aren't!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and almost every time Sarah is my bar tender. She is personable, always happy and knowledgeable. I continue to come back on the shifts that she works because of her. 5 stars for the service and happy hour!"}
{"text":"Went to the soft opening and was blown away. Great food and excellent staff. I am not a beer drinker so i have a mixed drink. Even though it is a beer garden and TONS of beer that i dont drink I will be back!!! wish i had two more thumbs so I could give this place 4 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Been meaning to stop in since I got to town a few weeks ago....  Today I saw their Hess FB post so I made the trek!!  ....Couldn't have been more disappointed... :(  They weren't busy, or I would have cut my server some slack.  I ordered the Hess Special....I'm assuming she forgot about me....as it took her 15 minutes to bring it.  Which when she set it on the table, she apologized.  I appreciated that!  Then I ordered the chicken pizza....WITHOUT onions.  To which she repeated back to me!!  When I get the pizza....with onions....  Disappointment gained steam again.  She never checked back in to ask how I was doing or how the food was, so I can only assume she realized she had forgot.... But that may not have been the case, given her service up to this point.  Needless to say, after giving it much thought, I neglected to tip her.  Something I have NEVER done and still feel guilty about, even though I feel it was warranted.  I may call the manager tomorrow to let him know about my experience and that I likely won't be back....  See how he responds, as I don't want it to be thought of that I am just a rude customer that is too cheap to tip.  I always tip, I always tip a minimum of 20%.  I will likely try out the Mill Ave location....which isn't as close....but such is life.."}
{"text":"The food is good. Lots of selections for beers.  The 2 stars is for the fans above the seats.  Most of the tables are under fans that cannot be temperature controlled and it blows your food and menus around.  Never will I be back...better atmosphere for the food."}
{"text":"True to their name, World of Beer is precisely that. You would be hard pressed to find a bar with a greater selection of beer. There is truly something for everyone! Light, dark, foreign, domestic, craft, cider...  There are lots of TVs to watch the game (what game? any game.) on. The interior is split into two different areas. The front area has a long bar that wraps around. The tap handles also wrap around the wall. I was amazed at how many taps they had! The back area is very comfy and a bit quieter. They also have a great, little patio to enjoy when the weather is nice. The servers were all pretty friendly.   My only complaints, it was pricey and parking was challenging.  You can find their daily draught selection online. You can see if they have a favorite on tap before you go. Trivia night is on Wednesdays.   Need a bite to eat to go with that beer? No worries. There are nearby restaurants that deliver. On some days, a food truck parks right outside.   I'd return but I won't be a frequent visitor."}
{"text":"This was a little different than your typical Mill Ave bar, it wasn't loud and full of drunken students. The ambience is nice, the music was not clubby and annoying. They have a decent beer selection and a few interesting ones to try. I believe my friend tried some sort of raspberry beer and I had a Guinness. She liked her beer, we didn't get any food so I can't say if the food is any good. Overall it was a nice relaxing place to go, get something to drink"}
{"text":"Obviously an excellent, well rounded beer selection. That's what you're going here for, right?  If you're hungry, don't expect a wide selection from the menu. It is neither lengthy nor diverse, and it is a bit pricey for what you get. On the other hand, what I ordered was served promptly and was super tasty.  Service was excellent, and the bartender was knowledgeable about the beers available, even offering a taste before having to commit to a beer from the on-tap selections."}
{"text":"I have visited this World of Beer a few times. I am from Florida and love WOB. Today's visit was a bit confusing. My wife and I had a few beers and some tacos, which were great. Myra was behind the bar and was very pleasant and attentive. Problem was when we got our bill. Tuesday's at WOB are 25% off bottles and cans and they didn't give us the discount for being a loyalty members. When asked, they said they didn't do that. Once I mentioned it was on their app as a part of the location, the answer changed too the customer having to ask for it. I've been to over 20 different WOBs over the past 8 years and never heard of this. Tuesday loyalty day is a company wide discount. I'm assuming the manager or owner came over, a white haired gentleman, grunting about giving us the discount, right in front of us!!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan! Plenty of rotating taps - they just did an Arizona takeover and have A LOT of (random) Arizona brews - and also bottles, all reasonably priced including their flights. This is a great place to watch a game or just catch up with friends. It's light and quiet for a bar. As I walked in last night, I realized it was all guys with the exception of two smart ladies at the end of the bar. Single gals, take the hint!"}
{"text":"Good place to stop in and have a beer with a friend while catching up. The only downside is there is no food but you can bring in or order from any of the restaurants nearby. Definitely a great place to explore different types of beers and push your boundaries. Hello banana bread beer that actually tasted like banana bread. winning."}
{"text":"Good beer but horrible service.  Took forever to get our order, gen mgr had to do it.  Refills too and checking on us forever. More interested in flirting with guys outside then helping us...food ok.  Not going back."}
{"text":"Brought a few friends over last night from out of town , I could not find my I.D. .. Found out I left it at the last place , came back with it and he still didn't let me in . Security guard was rude and had no reason - Won't be back ."}
{"text":"The service is pathetically slow.  Good deals but that does not make up for the fact that the service is so slow.  The people there just don't care about their jobs."}
{"text":"Walked in. Sat down. Girl looked at us 2x and never came over. Asked her to wipe the table. Did it, still didn't ask us if we wanted a drink. Nothing. Sat there for 15 minutes. Nothing. So we walked. Her lack of personality or excitement to be there was a little shocking. I have been here before and the bartenders have been great."}
{"text":"Great food and great staff the service is above and beyond good and the mac and cheese bites are awsome!!"}
{"text":"I think that of all the places on Mill Ave, this is a good one to stop at for a beer.  With that said, do not try going here on a weekend night.  No one is going to help you because they are so busy trying to help the throngs of ASU students who are apparently all in front of you.  The selection of beer is good, but you can't enjoy it without getting pushed or moved or nudged.  I will definitely try this place out when it's not so crowded but for now I would say that it is good for a quick pit stop on the way to a place that is not as crowded."}
{"text":"I loved the beer selection of course! I had a Hava Blue beer from Mudshark that was delicious. They even floated blueberries in the beer. The second beer I tried I was not too fond of, which is probably why I do not remember the name.   The waitress we had was not the friendliest, so over all the service was ok. She was not very knowledgeable about the beers either.   Tip . The only downfall about this place is they do not serve food. You are allowed to bring in outside food. So you have to plan ahead a little if you plan on drinking there for awhile and think you might get hungry."}
{"text":"I live 12 miles away, and try to find reasons to meet people here. Great atmosphere, friendly staff, good food, nice app specials, wireless and computer plugs under the bar. You can find the beer you want here. Hard to get in and out of lot, but always have parking."}
{"text":"This was more like 3.5 stars only because they seemed to understaffed and it took time to get service. Our waitress was awesome and friendly but a swarm of people came in around the same time... I didn't have any food here unfortunately for you guys. I didn't come here to dine :)  Anyhow I dont drink beer but they had a selection of 500 beers or something along those lines for you beer lovers. I had an Irish moscow mule which was awesome.  Beyond the drinks the set up was just awesome. The decor was awesome, brick wall, garage door,  lit up bar, indoor n outdoor seating and high ceilings. The fresh air felt amazing.  The live music just rocked ! Made this place feel like a mini concert hall :)  Anyhow the place was fun and I'd definitely come back cause the vibe rocked !  Sorry didn't take any pics just videos ;) Enjoy !"}
{"text":"ALL CRAFT BEER........I love this bar. I could hang out here for hours and hours.  I just wish it wasn't in downtown Tempe to where I have to worry about a DUI.....thanks Uber!!!"}
{"text":"Finally decided to give this place a try after trying to find a late night spot to get a drink and some food. For those of you who live out here in the Henderson area, things tend to shut down pretty quick during the week and there aren't too many choices that don't have slot machines in bedded in the bar tops to get some decent food and a cold beer.  We came here on a Wednesday night about an hour before closing and the bartender Matt was extremely gracious and kind.  Their beer list is exceptionally packed with variety and very good choices. Matt walked us through it and offered to give us any samples of anything we wanted. Also showed us the happy hour menu which was pretty impressive.  We decided to go with the tater tot nachos, not sure if that was the name but basically what they were, the wings and the mac and cheese bites.  The wings were pretty good. Meaty and juicy. I was a huge fan of the blue cheese sauce. I am more of a fan of the traditional chunky blue cheese but this was pretty tasty. Wings were not dry at all and refried to perfection. I'd give them a solid five out of five. We went with the traditional wings, but they do offer the boneless. And we went with the traditional buffalo style as well. Definitely a step above wing stop or any of the local bar and gaming places.  Tater tot nachos were definitely her favorite. Cheese sauce was typical, a little bit better than velveta unless it was velveta. Topped with bacon jalapeños chives and sour cream. Everything the heart needs to be happy. Another 5/5.  Last were the mac & cheese bites. I have to say these were not my favorite. Not sure what it was. Maybe the mac & cheese mix they used to make these lacked a little flavor or what. But they were good overall just didn't really pack a wow to them. I'd give them a 3/5.  Overall loved this place. Definitely would recommend this. Pretty cool that's part of the mall so you can do a little shopping it is before you had this place up."}
{"text":"5 stars for bringing in our favorite band in tonight!!!!!! This is our second time here...love the food, FABULOUS BEERS, service is asi asi. Great job!"}
{"text":"Good happy hour food items!! Crispy Chicken Sliders & Mac and Cheese Bites we're my favorites!!  Margherita Flatbread was just \"ok\".  Service was good but slow during the last call for HH"}
{"text":"We were very excited when this place opened! We really have never had a terrible experience. Our last experience was the first time the we just did not enjoy our food. Our server Lindsey was very nice and she noticed that we were not really eating and offered to grab us something else. We declined but the manager James came over and insisted they get us something else to make up for it not being to our taste. Then who I believe was the cook came out and just said, if you guys want some dessert, let us know and it will be on us! They were really fantastic with trying to make sure we were happy. We did not end up having dessert because we were full but the gesture was very nice. One of the bartenders who was getting off of his shift even came over and said hi to us because he recognized us from coming in a few times before. When it comes to the food, the Pretzel with Beer Cheese is the best! Make sure it is soft though! The beer selection is great and the knowledge is pretty good when it comes to the servers. If they don't know, they always suggest you try it which is awesome because you can try until you find something you really like! Great job guys!"}
{"text":"This first time I was here it was packed. My second time here and it is pretty full. It has a nice atmosphere her. It reminds me of pubs I 've been to in  England and Germann. The people seam to know the beer world. No punt intended. Lol I like the way they bring the large German pretzels to you on a large hanging hook. Something you don't see very often. If you ever wanted to try a beer you will not find in a store you will probably find it her. They have a small sampler beers on a board for you to try. I look forward and trying more beers here."}
{"text":"My gfs and I came in and got served by Taylor. We were the third table on this slow afternoon. It took 15 whole minutes to get greeted. Once we finally got asked what we wanted to drink we definitely ordered food. Wasn't gonna wait again. I asked if they had angry orchard and the waitress said only in a bottle. I said ok let's do that. She came back with two beers for my gfs, one was wrong. Gave me a water and asked my 18 year old sister if she wanted a different beer because they \"don't have\" angry orchard. WTF. We corrected her and I chose another beer. We had to get a manager to fix the order of the other beer.. then they brought the food. It was good except, one plate had fries but only 7 fries exact. One plate had Mac n cheese which was ROCK hard. We asked for a side of sriracha aioli and she forgot it twice. The third time we asked she brought plain sriracha. It was so dumb we couldn't understand what was happening. When we would tell her what's wrong she didn't understand what we were saying. Idk if she was on drugs or maybe drunk? The four of us will never go back."}
{"text":"We were very excited about this place and unfortunately were very disappointed. The food and service was below par. Awesome beer selection though!! Food was SMALL portions and very bland. Our waitress forgot two items and took about 30-40 min for food. Will not return- maybe for drinks at the bar, but that's it. It's a real bummer."}
{"text":"My friend and I hit this place hoping for another good bar with great local beers. They do have a lot of beers but unfortunately the bar is too small and poorly laid out. I don't mind standing but there wasn't even any good places to stand here we were always in the way.   Service was pretty horrible, I was handed a beer list and ordered a beer only to be told 5 minutes later that the keg was empty. So I ordered a different beer only to be told another 5 minutes later that that keg was gone. Frustrated I just ordered what my friend had gotten and that beer was finally handed to me about 10 minutes later.   My friend and I finished our beers and decided to bail, it took another 20 minutes to get our bill (for our 2 beers).  Needless to say, there are much better places to go for a good brew."}
{"text":"I'm at it again! This place is awesome! You are greeted at the door by the owner. Service was wonderful.(Thank You Rachel) I am not sure why they are getting bad reviews because I really enjoyed this place. The Staff is super friendly and helpful. The bathroom and restaraunt  is very clean which to me shows they care about their customers. The  patio area is comfy with fans and there are lots of TV's inside. I know where I will be during Football Season! All in All I suggest you at least try this place. The GERMAN PRETZEL is huge!"}
{"text":"I went to world of beer Saturday night. I was not intoxicated to the point where I couldn't handle myself. I love (loved) world of beer. Usually always attended there during the day. Anyways. .  I stood outside with my two girls friends we spoke about how we wanted to use a restroom and we love [loved] world of beer so we wanted to grab a beer and use the restroom.  The bouncer overheard us outside saying we wanted to use the restroom. He refused me to come in. I asked why. Like anyone would say. And he mentioned the restroom part. I replied I am getting a beer I am also a bartender in Scottsdale I know how it works. He still wouldn't  let me in .. At that point I decided to speak with a manager. The bouncer would not get me the manager. I became floored.  Eventually another bouncer came out and handled the situation better.      They said I couldn't come in because iwas wearing a crop too [ my stomach was showing ) FIRST OFF I had a cover up in my purse and the bouncer never mentioned that was the problem.  I'm positive he had no serious reason till then.  Finally another bouncer let me in and a manager comped first beers and I left. Not even using the restroom. I have never been more humiliated and degraded in my life as a  someone in the industry myself.    The rude bouncer had a beard.  And a serious ego problem. Also extremely unattractive.     Worst experience ever."}
{"text":"Bartender wasn't fun. She wasn't chatty and didn't even say thank you when we tipped and paid.. The door said 2am but they were cleaning up and asked for last drinks even before 1am.. felt like a grocery store selling different kinds of beer not like a local pub.. will not go back here.."}
{"text":"Nice addition to Epicentre. Just opened yesterday I believe but service is tight and well trained. Huge selection of drafts, bottles and cans similar to other locations. Nicer decor than others though. You can download an app that shows their beer list, which is nice. Hopefully this develops into the comfortable relaxed bar that is so sorely needed around here."}
{"text":"I'm actually mad at myself it took me so long to come here. As a fan of craft beer this place has just about anything you could ever think of. I love how you can choose 5oz or 16oz. You can also do flights if you choose to do so. The staff was super friendly and will help you choose a flight. The food is excellent as well. I highly recommend this place if your a fan of beer."}
{"text":"Love coming here. It's a great spot with an awesome beer selection, great food, and friendly bartenders. Never a bad night when you come in and have Sarah and Pua serving you drinks and making it a fun environment. The manager Devin is also really cool and friendly.   So if you're looking for great food and great beers, this is the spot for sure."}
{"text":"NOTES:  They don't serve food. You can bring in your own or order in from a few local vendors. It can get loud. Their beer selection will blow your fu&#ing mind.  That's what I'm here to review, the beer. My advice to anyone considering a visit to World of Beer, don't come here expecting a restaurant experience. You won't get it. World of Beer is about the beer and that's pretty much it. Sure, they've got live entertainment but I doubt I'll ever experience that because I don't dig eardrum-bleedingly loud. I'm too old for that shit and besides, I did enough damage to my hearing when I was young and stupid. What you will get is probably one of the best beer selections in northeast Ohio if not the entire state.  50 draught selections. Boom.  I know, how much is too much? If there's such a thing when it comes to beer I don't wanna know what it is. Besides, I won't worry about things like draught line cleanliness and stock rotation. That's what the highly-trained folks at WOB are there for and if my singular experience is any indication, they're doing it right. Clean glassware, proper pours, it was all there.  Hundreds of bottled selections. The beer menu at WOB is a stellar work of art. From the intro that walks you through nearly every beer style in the Brewer's Association list to the well-organized listing of beer sorted by country with helpful geekery like the beer's ABV%, serving size and style. I'd add IBUs to that, but that's just me.  The open-air front of the space is a great place to sit and enjoy your beer. On a perfect Cleveland spring day, the city nearly vacant because of the holiday, it was exactly as I would have wanted it. Slight breeze, fellow craft beer geeks and their others, the faint smell of cigarette smoke wafting in (damn I miss that smell when I'm in a bar). It was perfect.  We were there on a Memorial Day afternoon so it wasn't crowded to put it mildly. Perfect for me but probably not representative of their typical crowds, especially on the weekends. Our service was attentive and friendly, too. Would have been nice to have been served waters without having to ask (this should be beer bar 101) but that's nitpicking, I know. Also got to meet the GM Darell. Seemed like a great guy and he wears his passion for beer on his sleeve. He's also got the grip of a bear so if you ever shake his hand be forewarned.  We had a great time during our first visit to the World of Beer in Lakewood. Sure, I'd have loved to see more Ohio craft beer on those taps, but I bet they'll get more in time. This is a beer-lover's nirvana and if you're looking to expand your horizons libationally you can't do much better.  P.S. Download the WOB app. It's always updated and pretty damn handy."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this place. The beer selection is awesome. I just came back to the area after being in Europe for 3.5 yrs and WOB has a great selection of my favorite Belgium beers. A little expensive but it's worth it."}
{"text":"It's at the mall, but not in the mall. Still with me? Good...   The Wolrd of Beer is the ultimate \"dad bod\" watching spot. I mean copious amounts of brew, cozy booths, TVs, and wings, it's a magnet for light colored jeans and stark white New Balance shoes. I slumped in here after enduring the pain of Macy's right after the Christmas holiday and needed to rest and maybe sip a few drinks.   The beer menu here is staggering, and there's a style for every beer palate, Belgium brews, Heffs, IPAs, 2xIPAs, Ciders, Seasonal Beers, Porters, and the list goes on. Thet also a have full menu filled with tasty bar food, for seven dollars you get a main dish and two sides. We went with fried chicken sliders, mac n' cheese and fries and also ordered a house salad for some green on the plate. The sliders were ok, but the mac n' cheese was gooey, cheesy and covered with a crunchy bread crumb top.  There's a full patio with tables, TVs, blocks for kids and a cornhole set. This place will be popular during the spring time and March Madness, so if you're headed to the mall and a hop-head check this place out ASAP.   P.S. - A Yelp check-in gets you a free beer!"}
{"text":"I want to love this place.  The beer selection is always solid, and any beer enthusiast can find something unique that they haven't seen elsewhere in the valley.  The food is better than you would expect.  The space is cool.  So why only two stars?  Because the service is absolutely horrible and ruins the entire experience.  Tracking down our server was always an adventure and we would wait 10 minutes for ordered beers to show up (actually on 3 separate occasions our party had to re-order their beers and, in one case, just go up to the bar since it was clear the order had been lost/forgotten).  This is a management failure....there aren't enough servers, and the ones they have seem undertrained and in over their heads.  It's been like this since they opened, so clearly service isn't a priority for them...but it's enough to make me think twice about returning unless I'm just going to grab a quick beer at the bar."}
{"text":"I've never write a negative review but this is it. Terrible service. Beer in a cracked glass. Really? WTF? Also a hair in my friends drink. After our server cashed out and went off the clock we couldn't find anyone to service us drinks. This is a poor excuse for a bar. Can't imagine It will be staying open that long. World of Fail."}
{"text":"What can I say except that it has a HUGE selection of beers to cater to the University folks.  There are huge choices and lots of double IPAs and stuff like Imperial Stouts.  YUM.  A bit pricey.  They let you sample.  The atmosphere was a little bland...but again...but beer selection I found and I am impressed that they offer local AZ beers as much as they can.  Support our craft beer world!"}
{"text":"Come for the beer stay for the people watching.  With a crazy long beer list featuring some of the best local brews along with rare and hard to find drafts and bottle WoB is a spot any beer lover can get behind. When it comes to a view it may not have scenic sunsets and valley views but on any given weekend night it has fantastic views of the debauchery that is Mill Ave. Watch as a guy is shot down trying to pull a number on a corner or as a girl is carried to the car after a few too many PBR's at Moonshine. Don't forget the jesus lovers trying to convince ASU students they should give up their ways mid-party.  While I haven't sampled much in the food department the wings I had were solid and the pretzel with bacon beer cheese was not only massive it was just the right density for a snack and incredibly enough without a costco bottle of salt on it."}
{"text":"This is an ok place at best to go to with friends.  Or you can drop the wife off for shopping while you grab a beer and wait!  The service doesn't come with a smile and the beer is warm  I recommended this place to a friend but he was not impressed due to the temp of the beer  He mentioned it to the server but she looked at him like he was an idiot and said she could put it in the freezer to chill if he wanted to wait  When we asked for a frosted mug they said they didn't have that and the beer is always this temperature  We have been here several times but sadly no improvements in service The food is ok I like the huge pretzel and mustard or cheese dip  There are a lot of different and novelty beers but again they are not frosty cold if that's what you like  1 star for the appetizer 1 for the selection of beer and 1 star for good location"}
{"text":"Beer selection is 2nd to none. Always do a flight to figure out what I want. My only complaint is they need a beer menu for the bottled beer The food is great as always"}
{"text":"Came in for happy hour the pretzel was awesome the mustered was horrible there was four of us none of us liked it .we had 3 different types of sliders all sucked very dry no flavor burgers over cooked. Mac and cheese was some of the worst we have ever had Kraft Mac and cheese is 100 times better. No flavor at all...The margarita flatbread was awesome I have to say.. so if you stay with that and the pretzel your good..."}
{"text":"I have been here a handfull of times now an have yet to be impressed.  If you sit at a table expect the service to be beyond slow.  It has gotten better since they first opened but it is still not good.  On top of being slow I don't think I have met one friendly person that works here.  Most are not rude but just not friendly.  I recommend if you want a drink to go directly to the bar where the service is a little quicker.  They do have a small out door space which is nice to sit if you have a small group (no more than 4 people).  They do have a large beer selection so you are bound to find something you like.  However be prepared to pay, they are not cheap.  I am sure this is due to the fact that they do not serve food (you can order delivery from several local restaurants directly to the bar) so they are making all of there money on beer alone.  It is a really nice space and is well spread out so it never seems packed.  There are plenty of tvs if you are looking to watch the game.  All in all a good place to stop for one beer but not a place I would want to hang at for the evening."}
{"text":"Great selection of brews.  Server was great, unlike most servers on Mill St.  He did a great job.  Tater tots were great."}
{"text":"Jason are server was the bomb!!!  Had a great time and lots of fun!!  Will for sure be back."}
{"text":"I took of my business partners for happy hour. A man kept shouting at the servers and seemed to have a lot of tension in the air. We left"}
{"text":"If you are a beer lover, WOB is for you.  More taps than I have ever seen and some really interesting season beers.  There are so many, in fact, that you find yourself trying a different beer each time you order.  There are also flights so that you may try a few.  I also like that there are spirit options for people who don't want beer so don't think that you can't go if you don't drink beer because you can. There are limited food options but the giant pretzel is really yummy.  I did hear they will be adding more food as they become more established so that will be nice.  Music is loud and they often have live entertainment as well.  It can be pretty loud...oh wait, I said that.  Yeah.  There is good and there is not so good.  WOB is just too small to give a better review.  I wish the space was about double of what it is.  On a Friday or Saturday night it is should to shoulder and forget about getting a table (if you don't arrive early) as it is next to impossible.  For me, that is just too uncomfortable a setting.  I think I will choose to enjoy WOB during the day or off nights from now on."}
{"text":"Nothing special and kind of boring. Food left much to be desired. Almost every drink I tried ordering was out and the draft menu was printed same day. Boo. Not worth the trip."}
{"text":"Sadly disappointed. My husband and I stopped in for a quick beer on our day date and quickly realized it wasn't going to be the experience we were hoping for. They only had two waitresses for the entire bar and sitting area. 80% of people's beer glasses were empty. They had a good beer selection which is why I gave them a 2 star, but we said to each other that the management could probably do a lot better here with the potential this place has. Unfortunately we thought it might be just the day we were here but my husband went on to say that he came a few weeks ago and it was the same situation. Bummer"}
{"text":"This place was disappointing-- I wanted it to be so much better.  The service is awful.  I've tried them out twice... but It's almost like they try to ignore you.  & this was on a weeknights when the place wasn't busy at all.  How is that even possible?  Beers are very overpriced.  Our waitress didn't seem to know what she was talking about which was tough.  The beer she did recommend was something super sweet & fruity... just because I'm female, doesn't mean I like beer that tastes like a juice box.  It's hard to go wrong when you're called World of Beer, but wow. Lots of potential, just not following through."}
{"text":"This place is what it claims to be-- a world of beer. They have a HUGE menu--overwhelming, actually. I consider myself pretty knowledgeable of beer, but they had many I'd never heard of before. Unfortunately, they were \"out\" of several of the beers we requested. This is a huge pet peeve of mine in places that specialize in beer. Also, when they were out of one beer, they recommended another that was AWFUL. But, anyway, it's a nice stop for a drink or two. They don't have any food, which is kind of a downer. I guess some places will deliver there if you're really lazy or too drunk to move."}
{"text":"Same pros and cons as the Tempe location.  The good - selection, variety, tap takeovers.  The (really) bad - service, limited space, service (yes, I'm mentioning it twice), always way too packed, and bringing the incorrect drink.  Overall, this place is definitely good enough to frequent when it's not packed as hell."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, but that's about it.  Overpriced, poor service, and unbelievably small.  How did they expect to hype up an establishment called \"World of Beers\" in one of the biggest cities in the country (and right next to ASU) while operating in a building this small? Seriously?  They must have screwed up my order because the beer I ordered was definitely not the beer I received.  To their credit, I did go on opening week, and maybe it will be better in a few months. The first time I went was the day after it opened, and one more time on that weekend.   I would give it another shot, hopefully when it's not nearly as busy."}
{"text":"Service was good beer was great good mediocre fun environment but not too busy shrug great happy hour prices"}
{"text":"Finally tried the new World of Beer on a busy Thursday night.  I have seen this location change from an American Apparel and leasing office to now a bar and was pleasantly surprised with how well they transformed the space.  They created a small patio area and changed the windows to garage doors to be completely open on nice nights.  On the inside they created a second story space above the bar, which had a live band playing the night I visited.  So I'm not sure if the area is just for bands or extra space on other nights? There were lots of beers on tap and they had a large fridge of bottled beer from all over the world.  So anyone can be adventuresome without the co$t of travel and try a beer from a different country!   The place was OK, but really nothing special. It felt like the chain bar it is and not some cool local hangout.  I still prefer some of the other bars on Mill . Maybe, I will need to give WOB a second chance later down the road, but for now its not the bar for me."}
{"text":"Cool spot to grab a drink. Great beer selection."}
{"text":"Came here with my girlfriend today and it was amazing! The food is always really good and so is the service. Jay was our server and he was super nice, funny, and was always there when we needed something. Nikki followed behind jay and was very informative and great as well. Great place to go."}
{"text":"Great beer, yummy food, crummy service. Initially things took a little while but, within an acceptable range.  After 2 drinks and food the waitress disappeared and we sat at the table looking for ANYONE to come by for 30 min. Eventually had to seek someone out after noticing there wasn't a waiter or waitress in sight.  I think they're new and seems things are a bit bumpy but, they seriously need to improve the timeliness of their service."}
{"text":"I'm happy this place opened up at the Galleria Mall a few years ago. It's a great neighborhood place to drop in for a tasty brew and a bite to eat. Last night, I tried the Black and Bleu Flatbread and it was delicious and a good size - I was plenty full after eating half of it (and two beers!). Michael tried the Pork Schnitzel and said it was good, but a bit bland. (I tend to find all schnitzel bland, but that's just me). The tavern pretzel is a favorite there although we didn't order it this time. The place gets a bit noisy, with sports on the many flat screens and all of the lively conversations going on. But we were still able to hear each other at our table. There's a nice outdoor patio area, as well. We've sat there a few times in the past, and enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Great food and large selection of beer.  I didn't give it the full stars because  my friend asked her what was in the mac and cheese.  The waitress didnt tell her that there was bacon on it and she's a vegetarian.  It wasn't even in the description in the menu.  And the waitress didn't offer to exchange it and the bacon one was not taking off her receipt.  Weather in that will definitely go back to guest place very good atmosphere the food was good and we let our waitress pick our selection of beer for beer tasting and did a very good job"}
{"text":"There is a MASSIVE beer list; literally a small phone book of beers, so it can be fairly overwhelming. However, WOB puts out a featured beer list of about 40-50 beers and they update it often. Makes choosing something much less frightening. It's definitely a good place to go if you're a beer lover and/or an adventurous beer drinker. I would say I don't really fall into either of those categories but I've never been disappointed.   Tip: DON'T BE AFRAID TO ASK FOR SAMPLES. There is no shame in it. If you really don't like it, don't buy it. Ask for another sample. I had to ask for three one night and the waitress obliged. I finally found a fantastic beer - a White Chocolate Ale. Wow. So I'm slowly expanding my beer choices.   Expect a college bar vibe with lots of TVs playing college sports, trivia nights, food being delivered, random guys playing guitar on the upper level, so-so staff (some were really great or really off) and the crowd that an ASU-Mill Ave bar attracts. The beer list made me give it four stars. Really there's not much else that distinguishes this place from other chains. Just a good place to meet where everyone can find a beer they like."}
{"text":"Let me start by telling you that I didn't even get a beer at \"World of Beer\"  Why?  Because the place was unbelievably packed and we couldn't get a beer if we tried.  We weren't the only ones.  People were standing in front of the bar wondering why there were ten employee's standing around talking to each other while potential customers tried to decipher the code to get served.  Are you supposed to do jumping jacks while simultaneously downloading the \"World of Beer\" app while super simultaneously shouting \"I'm hip gimme a beer\" or something?  I don't know because I wasn't about to stick around and deal with it.  We left the joint craving a nice cold beer, a beer they could have easily provided and then some.  Anyway, as far as service goes, it seemed to be nonexistent.  If I were a college kid and service didn't really matter, would I go here?  If my friends were going I probably would, but if you're an adult looking for good beer there are plenty of other bar's with more room and a helpful staff.  For the record though, I am basing my review on service, not on the beer.  I don't know if they serve the beers I am accustomed to because they didn't really seize the opportunity to gain my business.  On the other hand, its safe to say (being in downtown Tempe) that its geared toward the younger crowd so maybe they don't want thirty somethings frequenting the place anyway!"}
{"text":"Nice selection of beer. However, be careful if you paid with a card. One of the servers (I think his name was Ryan) decided to change my tip. Apparently the managers (if they exist) do not care because they never attempted to contact me back."}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try this place for a while, final got the chance last night and was a Huge disappointment.  We sat down in a booth, the waiter walked by several times without Saying a word to us, he took other tables orders, brought them menus.  We waited over 15 minutes without any serves at all. We had heard the service was bad but this is ridiculous. We left and will never return. We ended up next door at bravo the food and service was amazing.."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, I tend to avoid bars for their food. There are usually minimal decent veggie options. I was shocked when the waitress told us their meat substitute was a homemade black bean burger. Had that in the steak sandwich and it was amazing. Best tasting non burger I've had in a long while. Tasted fresh and not greasy. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"BAD SERVICE !!!!!!!!!  If I could give this establishment no stars I would. The service here is far from good. Took a bartender 20 min to serve. They were rude and it wasn't just one. This place is ran poorly and when asked to speak to management they acted like it wasn't their problem. Once management came along it was the same story. I enjoy drinking craft beer and was in hopes to find a good place and this was not it! BEWARE!!!!! This place is not the place to go too."}
{"text":"Great selection of beer, but a limited menu, and the service was awful. I can understand slow service when a place is packed, but there was no excuse for the inept service we had when we were there early on a Wednesday when the restaurant was less than half full."}
{"text":"Came here with a group for Happy Hour the other day and it was wonderful! Was able to pre-arrange this so when we arrived the tables were set and waiting for us. Server was attentive, professional, friendly and responsive...we had a great time and great service and I will definitely be back with other friends! Great place for Happy Hour and the food and drink were great!!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, reasonably priced food and drinks, and very friendly staff. I do have to say the food was just ok but everything else made up for that. I went with a group of 7 people and we were seated right away. We sat halfway on the patio and half inside so we could feel the nice breeze and watch the sunset. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"500 bottled beers and 60 rotating drafts. What's not to love? Fun atmosphere. Cool idea to have the food menu be local restaurants that deliver to you table.   Only beef is the price of the beers."}
{"text":"I still like this place but the food is still hit or miss and I end up freezing every time I come here. It wouldn't hurt to put sound on for World Cup games either.   This is a great place for a spot of lunch or to watch a sports game. I have had a few menu items that are less than par, but today we had pretzel, margarita flatbread and chimay burger. All delicious.   Pua was our server and she was excellent. It's always a fun day at World of Beer. My only negative comment...on World Cup Qualifier games , they should open early!"}
{"text":"As a beer lover, I've been very satisfied since World of Beer opened in Lakewood. I don't remember how many types of beer they have on tap on any given day, but I know that it's a lot...and I would like to try them all. By far, the best beer selection I've found at any place in the city. Darren, the beer purchaser is always on hand to answer questions about the different types of beer and always willing to help you select the right beer for you depending on your mood. The list of beers on tap is constantly changes and allows you to try something new everytime you come in. They don't serve food, but they allow you to order takeout from different places in the area. The bartenders are very attentive and they, too, have great knowledge of the different types of beer."}
{"text":"We've been here a bunch of times for a reason. The beers are great! Service is great! Food is pretty decent. I think they literally count the French fries though, and the giant pretzel, which is a little pricey in my opinion, should include the cheese and mustard dips, instead of charging extra. Atmosphere is nice, too. Very clean. Definitely a place to try!!"}
{"text":"Way too pricey.  Great place to try out or visit once, but thats about it. Had 2 Old Chubs and a Sam Adams Pumpkin. (the S.A. pumpkin tasted like medicine, My least fave pumpkin ) The high gravity beers are poured into a 10oz goblet.  All three inlcuding tip was over a little over 20 bucks. I  Service was alright.  I can tell the waitress was new, so I will cut some slack on that.   The whole experience was just A-OK."}
{"text":"Nice variety without a doubt. I've liked the service for the most part. But I CANNOT rationalize these prices! Seeing things I ordinarily pay $5.50 for priced at $8.50. Most of the beers on the draft menu are closer to $10 than $5, regardless of ABV or geography, and I can't get comfort with that. Is it because they don't serve food? Been a very sparse crowd when I've been there and I'm guessing this is likely why. Also have found that some of my selections taste as though they've been sitting around far too long -- both draft and bottle. Again, high prices equals sparse crowds equals low turnover. Also annoying that half the bottles in the cooler aren't on the bottle list. It's January 2014, why am I looking at a bottle list labelled Fall 2013? I don't want to hover over people's backs to squint at the beers in the cooler. Sorry WOB, that's gonna be my last visit. Good luck, think you're gonna need it."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out from a post I saw. I am a big fan of trying different beers especially when they have a large selection along with food.  Atmosphere is very nice good place to go all year long.  Checked in with yelp and got the free local beer, tried other beers as well,  so many beers  too choose from. The food was ok had the meatballs, tater tots, fried pickles and a gigantic pretzel which was the best. Our bartender was ok she never asked how we were doing and it was hard to get her attention. Now for the bad part I had a piece of hair in my fried pickles,  the bartender replaced them but kept them on my check and I don't remember her apologizing for it.  The 4 stars are for everything else but the pickles"}
{"text":"Knowledgeable staff especially the bartenders. The pretzels and fried pickles are great. Other food is so-so but we dont go for the food."}
{"text":"While I am disappointed in how my night turned out, I am very appreciative of the World of Beer Bouncer Josh for helping us out tonight. World of beer bouncers are easily the best in Arizona, thanks Josh! I am a visitor from out of state who had been denied entry to multiple bars while out in Tempe, Arizona. Apparently, Arizona no longer permits the use of vertical IDs as valid identification. I am a California resident who turned 21 in 2013 and am the owner of a vertical CA license because I received my renewed license one month before turning twenty-one. I also decided it was unnecessary to pay the $25 to have my ID replaced after turning 21 because it had not hampered me from getting into establishments that sold alcohol nor had it prevented me from purchasing alcohol at other locations. After being turned down by multiple bouncers at multiple bars, Josh at World of Beer in Tempe gave me more information on the situation and the law that had been passed in June of last year."}
{"text":"WOB will make you WOBBLE!  I am a self professed beer idiot, but I did check World of Beer out this week and was really impressed.  I met there with a friend to discuss a Beer Olympic charity event we are planning.  Thinking we would be inspired we chose to meet at WOB.  Not only were we inspired but we inspired the bartender, which led to meeting the manager and potentially planning an additional charity event at WOB.   If you are intimidated by long beer lists, like I am, tell the bartender what you like and they will give you a taste of a few options to pick from.  All in all I felt very comfortable to return and continue to try new beers.  There is hope for me!"}
{"text":"Came through last night with a few of my friends and we had a pretty good time. We were helped by Jay, who was upbeat and full of energy. Several of the people at our table had asked Jay for beer recommendations and he did not lead us astray. There seemed to be a decent selection of local/craft beers which my friends seemed to like. Jay even pointed out a gentleman who was a local brewer and mentioned that some of them like to come in on occasion.  The drink prices were surprisingly good. Some of us got our checks back and were surprised that it didn't add up to more. This is a nice mellow spot to come drink with your friends, chop it up with the waiters, and munch on some decent food. I would say food is decent, but main reason you wanna come here is to try the various beers they have to offer."}
{"text":"I'd really like to give this place a decent review, and would have after most of our past visits. We typically go to Gen (Korean BBQ next door - highly recommend) once or twice a month. The wait is usually long enough at Gen that we stop in WOB for a beer or two while we wait. We've always had pretty decent and timely service. The last time we were there we waited a while to be sat (they were busy). By the time we had a table, we waited another 5-10 minutes for a server. We already knew what we wanted (2 beers total) so ordered right away. After waiting another 15 minutes, we got a text that our table at Gen was ready. We tried to look for our server to cancel our order, but couldn't find her, so we left. After being seated at Gen, a woman from WOB walked over to our table to tell us we had to pay for the beers we ordered but were never served (or drank). We didn't want to argue, but we did feel it was a bit ridiculous given how long we had waited without even being served. She invited us to come in after our meal to have the beers we paid for, but we really have no desire to go back."}
{"text":"Great little spot for beer lovers! Was pleasantly surprised with how cheap some of the beer specials were. We were able to get 4 beers each and only spend $11/12 total, and for some good quality beer that is a great deal. Happy hour specials were pretty well priced and the food was top notch for bar food. We got the fried pickles, shrimp tacos, buffalo wings and a side of Mac and cheese and they were all cooked well and had some great flavor. The only reason this isn't 5 stars is the service was just a tad slow, which we think was just an anomaly with our waiter as everyone else had a little bit faster service. Definitely recommend checking out for some unique beer and great finger food!"}
{"text":"I met here to grab a beer on a Thursday night.  It wasn't crowded, so it was nice to sit and just talk.  The high top tables have stools that spin - making me feel that kid urge to just sit on the stool and spin around a few times.  Not a good idea with a beer in your hand, and a little socially awkward...  I thought the layout was nice, bar, tables, booth or two.  I think there's a room in the back that would be nice for a little get together.  There was a food truck (school bus) outside, providing food that they don't serve inside.  I think Thursday is ladies' night, or half off local brews or something.  The selection wasn't up my alley, so I opted for a full price woodchuck.  I think this place could be really great of you hit the right \"specials\" night, with a solid food truck out front.  This experience wasn't quite that, but I believe it to exist.  I'll be back, maybe not often - but in hopes of that great night."}
{"text":"Great choices of beer and the pretzel is amazing. The service is the worst I have ever experienced! Went for happy hour because Kona Grill was so busy and we really should have hovered to find a table at Kona!!"}
{"text":"This review is for 4.5 stars.  As far as selection of beer, this might be the best in town.  In Henderson, World of Beers is top for sure.  They offer sample of 4 oz for about $2-4 per draft and also smaller samples from te bartender to try before ordering a pint, for free!  The thing that places World of Beers above the rest is their selection of high ABV brands of beer.  From their extensive draft list of over 30, I found about 15 above 7%, which is very remarkable for Vegas.  Their can/bottle list is even better as it's listed at an affordable price with most under $12, even rare, Belgian varieties.  They ave an easy to navigate menu for bottles/cans as well as . regular draft menu that' sup to date.  On top of this, they had a Happy Hour 5-7pm which offers some draft beer discounts on pints, a hlaf dozen $5 food options, and $6 wine.  In all, the waitstaff is great and the Happy Hour is awesome.  The selection is fantastic as well.  My Lots of TVs and an indoor/outdoor venue makes it great for summer.  My biggest complaint was that the flights are not priced consistently.  When receiving the check, I was caught off guard that my flight was about $14, as each pour ranged from $3-4 rather than a consistent $12 (or the like) price for a flight.  I would like some consistency in flights, but overall I was very happy with my night out, watching sports, drinking great beer, and enjoying the Happy hour food menu.  I will be back certainly when I'm in the area.  Please expand to Summerlin!"}
{"text":"World of Meh!  We went to dinner having read the reviews about the okay food and they were spot on! We had the Giant Pretzel (The best thing we had! Delish!) the Chimmicurri meatballs (eh) then BBQ bacon burger (ok) and a Brat ( no Bueno) If we had not read about the loyalty card/app we would never have known because our server certainly never told us- they need to train the staff!! Also, the food was wayyy to quick (hint already prepared? Frozen? I don't know but something tells me they are not making this fresh- haven't you watched Kitchen nightmares people?) make it fresh or don't make it at all! I can go to Wendy's for the same burger for half the price! Skip the desserts- not worth the hype!  The beers were good- go here- eat a pretzel drink a beer but don't waste your money on the food."}
{"text":"As a non-beer drinker, but a hard cider lover, this is the place for me!  It's pretty much the only place in town that has cider on tap and tons of bottle options.  I love the bar, and as others have stated, try to grab a seat there for better service if you.  With about 30 seats, we've never had a hard time finding a seat on a Saturday afternoon.  (I'm too old to be there on a weekend night.)  I love the open atmosphere and the dog patio... it's a great place to hang out on a nice day and watch a game.  The beer selection is pretty awesome for the fella, who's a big Belgian style beer fan."}
{"text":"Dont eat here if you are looking for good food or service. Like othere reviewers we waited about it 15 min before we had to flag down a server. I was given the wrong beer and the bar tender completely ignored me and was more interested in the football game.  He was not happy when I finally said \"excuse me...\". My bf asked for a second beer and after 10 min had to go up to the bartender and ask for it again.  I'm from out of town but will never visit any of these restaurant chains.  The food was marginal and there flat bread pizza looks like a 5 year old made it.  They are poorly staffed for a Sunday football crowd."}
{"text":"After a bit of shopping at galleria mall, I was happy to sit down and relax outside for a bit and try out a new place.   This place offered indoor and outdoor seating, immediately was able to seat myself and received a prompt greeting and drink order. I also ordered the tator tots with the cheese, jalapeños and bacon, I forgot the name but they weren't the poutine tots. They were good, the jalapeños were fresh and the beer cheese wasn't lacking. I hate when places skimp on cheese! I had the bangers and mash and my boyfriend had a burger with avocado and some type of green salsa on it. While we both agreed they were good, but not great, i felt the dishes missed a lot of opportunity for flavor. The orange sweet gravy on the bangers and mash was yummy, and pulled the dish together well. However the sausage, peas, and potatoes were kinda boring and not very fresh tasting. I admit I am a food snob though so don't let this honesty detour you.   For 2 entrees, an appi and a glass of lemonade our meal was only $33. For the price and atmosphere you can't really go wrong for that. I'm sad I left my ID and couldn't try the beers! I feel that would probably be the best part of the place... hence \"Beer\" in the name..   The service was outstanding, and I absolutely LOVED that they allowed a man to bring his dog inside the outdoor seating area. Try this place out! And I hear they have happy hour. They're worth a shot!"}
{"text":"I love this place for trying out just about any beer you want to try! Service is great and they can always recommend a beer if you don't know what to drink or what you want. The only bad side is they don't serve food but plenty of places nearby will deliver here."}
{"text":"With this location and beer list, you think it would be busier and more successful. Service is a let down every time, with slow orders, limited knowledge, and no ability to interact with customers.But hey, great beers!"}
{"text":"OK, I gave it 4 stars for the beer selection!!  We had a really bad experience as we were cashing out, so let me explain!!  First of all, awesome beer selection!!  Secondly, we had a great server at the bar named Brad!!  He knows his stuff!  We ordered a giant pretzel with beer cheese!!  Great food!  So if I could of ended it there, the experience was top notch.....until.....................5 pm shift change was rolling in!  This gal that was apparently a server (looked more like a stripper) came waltzing in.  The rest is history.  My wife looked at me, and I looked at her!!  This can't really be happening!  I could clearly see that my wife was upset, so we asked for a manager.  The young man was very polite and all, but said we would need to go to higher levels than him, which were not available.  He did admit that she was not appropriately dressed and that he had issues with her on other occasions.  Guess someone better figure it out!!  Probably will avoid the place if this gal is working, and definitely hope someone can figure out why such a classy place could allow an employees like this gal!!   Thanks for listening!  Hope you take this seriously!"}
{"text":"Went for some post-lunch beerage in the early afternoon. It was a lot colder than I thought it would be, but I was coming from Florida. I really appreciated the wide range of local taps that were available. I'm glad to know that they try to have local options. I'm used to the ones in Florida, so it was a pleasant surprise to see one. The outside was sort of mysterious, as I hadn't expected it to look so cool inside. It seemed like a good place to bring large groups."}
{"text":"After paying for bill with tip totalling $190.00, $30 of it was a tip, service disappears. Wanted water refills and didn't get any service.  Service was OK while tab was being built but once tab was closed and bill paid, service was gone....Non existent. Never visiting this location again."}
{"text":"My friend and I had a good time. We went during happy hour, which is 3-7pm. We tried almost all of the happy hour menu. The servings were a lot bigger than I expected, 5 star already!!! Definitely worth it for $5 each! Had the tacos, tried both chicken and barbacoas, which were full size ftw! Mac and cheese bites were bomb! The meatball sliders were okay, they were on the dry side but still tasty. Tater tots went really well with our flights of beer (not included in the happy hour) My favorite was the Margherita flat bread! Definitely must try, it was so goood!!!!!   The reason why we decided to go here was definitely the choices of beer, which did not disappoint, more than 500 beers to pick from. I had the local beers flight which were all delicious! Definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"This place is overall pretty great! I used to love that I could go there with my friends and fam. The atmosphere is cool, great beer selection, and they used to have a wrap that I loved! I am vegan, and the veggie wrap was easily made vegan by ordering it without cheese. But the menu changed and the only vegan options now are fries, tots, rice and broccoli, all ordered as sides. It would be great if something vegan could be on the menu. More and more people are switching to a plant based lifestyle and its a shame to miss that demographic. And I am sad that I won't frequent there as much.   Please being back a real vegan entre so that vegan and omnivores can all eat and drink and be merry together at your great restaurant!"}
{"text":"Wow, I've been here three times and haven't reviewed World of Beer, yet? I have just returned from a few drinks with Laura L. ( \"one\" beer turned into a flight plus three more plus finishing Laura's beer because she needed food). I have a nice Saturday afternoon buzz going as I write this (taking a rest before going on a bender tonight, methinx!).   I'm reasonably sure that I am far more coherent now than after my last two visits which would explain why I've not reviewed this place yet,  Anyway, they are pretty crazy crowded almost every night of the week with a few exceptions which is why I seldom stop by. It is quite a treat when there is a place to sit as was the case today.   I love beer so any time I come in here I feel like a priest at an altar boy retreat with all of the amazing selections on tap, not to mention a good selection of bottled beers. While I would LOVE to see ANY Aussie beer beside Fosters, they more than make up for it with a ton of Belgian and German beers.  I asked our lovely server to prepare a flight for me based on my preference of pilsners and ambers. She put together an AMAZING flight and my hat is off to her for her brilliant choices and especially her \"wild card\" which was the best of my flight and constituted the additional three beers that I mentioned above.  I would love to come here in the evening but because of the crowd probably will not but I will be back for day drinking.  Well done, World of Beer"}
{"text":"Big selection of beers. They also have a small mix drinks menu as well. Didn't realize it until a few days ago but they also serve food? Not sure if it's good or not. Didn't want to pay for overpriced food if it's going to be bad.  The white chocolate and the Hava beer with blueberries was good!  I say come in a small group because it's true what they say about the place being small. And eat first because the food here is unknown variable. Who knows if it's good or bad. And then you'll be out some money too that could have been spent on beer."}
{"text":"Overall the Beer selection was good, but we didn't get service for 15 minutes, then got an attitude from the server (who happened to be training anoter employee- and what a training!) and to top it off we got an extra 3$ on our bill = major fail.  Walk in there at your own risk ya'll!"}
{"text":"Huge beer lover and you can't go wrong with this place...but it's near ASU and the girls working are very attractive."}
{"text":"Great food,  beer,  service and sports. Like the patio,  non smoking no gambling feel.   Free local beer check in with yelp every time u get here.   Wow,  these guys are cool"}
{"text":"It was a cool place to hang out. It's pretty pricey though but I would go once in awhile. Service was great. Great music. It was kinda cold in there but otherwise a good first experience."}
{"text":"Sat near the entrance on the couches, with some games and a TV. Came here the night before NYE, and it was fairly empty.  Our server originally was the one who showed us to our seat. Nice guy, and we expected him to host us, since he himself said he would, but halfway into the night, we had a different server- OK.  I enjoyed their infused drinks. Feel free to ask for samples. Overall, decent place- good service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"If this was a year ago I would give 5 stars, but WOB has changed for the worse.  I will start off by saying Linda, Ben, Kenny, Cody, and both Brittany's were all great! They were the coolest people with the best ability to match my palette to their selections. Well, Kenny and Cody moved to other locations and Brittany left the company. After then there were new bartenders that were cluelessly rude!  I was a regular, being an IT person, we deal with a lot of stupid stuff on a daily basis. WOB was the perfect place to kick back, have a beer, watch a game or play trivia on Tuesday's. I've met many awesome people there, and even when awkwardly running into my boss while bar hopping, still had a good time!  The last time I was there I sat at the bar on a slower night and was completely ignored! There were people who walked up to the bar and were served immediately. I had to ask two guys next to me for a beer menu, then tried to flag one of the bartenders to take my order to no avail.  I know WOB is busy as all get out, and I like that about the place (except the lack of seating), so I don't push the servers to take my order, especially since most of them are super cool people. But the last experience of shitty service was on a particularly crappy day for me, and being completely ignored was the icing on the shit cake. I ended up leaving and going over to CASA, who I would get mediocre service and received the best service ever from them then and since."}
{"text":"Came here to meet up with a friend for lunch, heard the food was pretty great for a beer place hah. When we arrived there were a handful of people, so I expected faster service. But apparently our server must have been a bartender too, because she was really only up at the bar and kind of forgot about us. Good thing we chatted for a while, when our server finally came back I asked her which sandwhich/burger was the best and she recommended the pesto chicken and said it was amazing, so I took her advice and got it. The focaccia bread was very light and pretty amazing but the rest of the sandwich was pretty bland in my opinion, I could barely taste the pesto in it and the chicken was very thin, but it was pretty juicy for as as thin as it was. I guess next time I will just have to try something else that sounded more appealing to me, although that was one of my choices I was looking at. All in all I wasn't amazed with this first time experience but will definitely give this place another try."}
{"text":"Great food! I had the hummus wrap, my husband had the schnitzel and my cousin had the flat iron steak sandwich. We all enjoyed our food! Lots of beers to choose from.  Definitely going to return!"}
{"text":"Great welcome as I walked in---staff were attentive and witty! I have the Sangria and it was some of the best Sangria I had ever had!!  It doesn't get 5 stars simply because 2 of the dishes I wanted to try had been sold out."}
{"text":"Everything about this place was solid, great food. It could of had a little better service. My dad was in heaven over the beer selection. My mom's salad was delicious. Definitely, my sister and my eyes were larger than our stomachs over the kids meal."}
{"text":"Even though the location is not convenient, this is becoming a favorite place. The food is great, the beer is always interesting and the service is extremely professional from top to bottom.  Tonight, our third time here, we were shocked to hear that our server, Jake, was on his first night on the floor. We had asked what they do to train people to know their beers so well, and he regaled us with a tale of the 300-question test that's more difficult than what's in most of his college classes and how they can't go on the floor until they pass and try most of the food.  We've never gotten food we didn't think was fantastic, even the black and blue flatbread that i didn't realize had mushrooms and onions, the two foods I despise. I ate half of it before I could stop to pick them out because I was enjoying it so much.  Oddly, I would like to see them carry more brands of beer or rotate the happy hour selections more often, but they have a very eclectic mix, so it's a pretty trite complaint. The acoustics make it quite loud inside, so it is not the place to go if you're looking for a quiet conversation or a place to think."}
{"text":"My Husband and I were looking for lunch and stumbled upon this place. They do not serve food out of the establishment but offer a menu of four local food joints that you can call and have it delivered.  If it was not for Kaleb(sp?) behind the bar, we would have had a beer and left.  His service was outstanding.  Personable, patient, genuine and knowledgeable.  Awesome selection of beers and immaculate.   Parking- blah but worth the walk!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty good place, and I will definitely be back! On Mondays they have a $5 burger or brat deal all day. It looks like they also have other deals and specials throughout the week, and their happy hour menu has some decent offerings.  I'm not a huge beer person, but can appreciate what they have to offer. They have a selection of over 500 craft beers. This is the perfect place to get together with your friends. It's a laid back, friendly atmosphere. Shout out to Jeff, our server, for his awesome hospitality.  I ordered the $5 burger with fries, one of the ciders from the happy hour menu, and the waffle s'mores for dessert. It was all delicious!"}
{"text":"Nice selection of tap beers and they have bottles arranged by country. Bartenders are all beer geeks and can explain a lot."}
{"text":"Ok, let me be fair: I love a place with a good beer selection and this place has it. I mean, it's all in the name.   However, the waitstaff is never great and the prices are, let's be honest, insane. I get it: you're right downtown in a college town that's known for drinking. You can get away with a lot. Went here for Halloween and definitely felt like I got robbed."}
{"text":"Tons of beer. Tons of tvs. Our server, Rachel, was attentive and fast. Cool decor with brick walls and dugout-like seating. Prices were reasonable too."}
{"text":"WOB WOB WOB!  I had an old friend who worked here after I graduated from ASU in 2012 so I payed her a vista and boy was it great!  So many beer options... and I'm indecisive, I had to get 3 different ones on tap! Service, after she left, was actually pretty poor which caused my star deduction.  Other than that I love the options here and the ability to get either a bottle or tap is nice.   All in all, if craving a weird beer from away place I would stop by when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I've come back here two times since my initial visit and I must say the place has grown a little on me.  The second visit I ran into one of the beer reps for the bar I work in, so he introduced me to the manager/owner(not sure which one he is for sure) who was very pleasant and knowledgeable.  The bar wasn't crowded and I actually got to talk to the bartenders.  I still think it's overpriced however they have some really great selections worth trying out.  I recommend coming here during the week so that you won't have to fight a crowd."}
{"text":"This is hands down the worst service I have ever encountered.   Our server took a few minutes before greeting our table. She was hesitant to answer any question the menu; telling us,\"I will be back in a minute.\" After 10 minutes of waiting my party decided to leave.   The venue has a total of 12 patrons   Will NEVER return"}
{"text":"One of the off-duty bartenders (Richard) felt the need to explore every detail of his otherwise unknown feelings for another worker while drunk and at the bar.  There was a perceived offense for which Richard really showed his ass and made several patrons uncomfortable, and made me feel as though I never want to waste my hard earned money at such an emotional establishment again.  I don't need to spend my time and money dealing with your problems, especially when you are a worker, and have now cast a hugely negative cast on your entire establishment."}
{"text":"STOP STOP STOP wow! The bad reviews for this place are so dumb and I mean lol you have to be kidding me dumb. This place is fine it has and excellent beer selections with IPADs on helping you find a beer, an app for your phone as well. BTW anyone that really drinks beers know you don't chill the glass, you give it a water rinse and pour. As far as slow service I just haven't experienced it and I've been here many times. MATT the bartender is on point with service and knowledge. Plus discounts for service industry and fun live music provided (yeah it's live music, it's gonna be loud but it's not the radio either). Food... it's not Joel Robuchon but it's good bar food. The mac and cheese bite on happy hour price deliciousoohhsoo! I do wish some of the stuff was a bit better meh it's in it's zone but I'm smart enough to know what place I'm in and know they can always tweek it with -constructive criticisms- come on yelpers. Area of the bar is big and inviting and the patio is nice and they have cool air fans out there, it's 106 tonight and I'm perfectly comfortable out here in pants and flip flops. A bonus fact every time I've come the restroom have been emasculate that shows a dedication to cleanliness! One more thing any review you read that has someone saying the manager doesn't care is always full of it. All managers care about their customers, it takes a special, ahem (back side) person to make a managers say no to a guest.  So for an honest review of this place  1 real good beer selection 2 clean establishment  3 bar food on par with anywhere else 4 friendly staff (you just have to say hi yourself) 5 management staff that will listen to you and I've seen myself helping out their employees  6 big area for large groups 7 B 8 E 9 E 10 RRRRRRRRR"}
{"text":"I was visiting Tempe from Tucson and my friend and I were starving late after a concert, we chose to go to World Of Beer at first they said the kitchen just closed but then the chef came out and asked what we wanted and whipped it up for us really quick. We ordered the tots and gigantic pretzel. We ordered a cider and \"not your fathers root beer\" they said they received one bottle of the root beer for the staff to try but gave it to us anyways. The staff was extremely friendly, food was great and the service was awesome. I really dislike the world of beer back home in Tucson because the service there is disgraceful, but I was so impressed with the world of beer in Tempe."}
{"text":"Bartender brought an expensive beer that was 1/3 foam. Asked him to top it off, he gave attitude. Earned himself no tip and a bad review."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to World of Beer today and ordered some beers and had dinner. The beer I received (Santa Fe Happy Camper in a can) was expired. It wasn't just a few days old, it was 5 months expired! The food was just average and didn't have anything that made it stand out against other places. They have a nice selection of beer, so that is nice, but check the expiration date if you order a beer in a can of bottle. Skip the food though and get something else before you go so you can enjoy it. I ordered the chipotle chicken sandwich with fries. My sandwich was bland and the fries were bland too."}
{"text":"I liked when WOB was in south end but this place is nothing like the old WOB. It's Disorganized. No hostess but it's not clear you can seat yourself. Slow service. Server doesn't know anything about Beer. Bartenders don't know how to pour beer. I won't be back. I'll give it two stars just because they have a lot of beer."}
{"text":"I love the outdoor shopping areas in Arizona, and this World of Beer happened to be right in the middle of one.  We were heading back to our friend's house, in preparation of flying back to the frigid weather in Buffalo, and knew we had to make one last stop and enjoy the perfect, sunny, patio weather.   It was pretty dead; given it was a Tuesday around 4pm.  I was mesmerized by the selection of beers.  Actually, I was overwhelmed.  There were sooooo many I wanted to try, and so little time!!!  I can't even remember the one I chose, but it was a local AZ brew and it was delicious. I am even more excited now, because I have been told World of Beer is coming to Buffalo!"}
{"text":"This place has quality craft beers and bartenders that know how to pour a good beer.   The reason it did not get 5 stars is there is no shade for the outdoor seating which in the Arizona heat is quite unfortunate.  Other than that I would recommend the pretzel with beer cheese. It is large enough for two people or one if you're feeling quite hungry. The place is also clean and the staff has a good grip on beer knowledge."}
{"text":"I used to love this place a lot, recently it seems to have gone downhill. However, they have a large selection of beer and their draft beer changes fairly regularly but they have something for everybody. They are a bit pricy but it really makes up for it in the selection. There is also trivia on Tuesday around 7. The seating is spaced out and there is outdoor seating however during the weekends it gets a bit packed so get there early!!"}
{"text":"The bar was very nice but it is hard to order a beer there and to find a seat.  Very small bar and everything is priced differently. No posting for happy hour but we got a happy hour discount. Would have been nice to know."}
{"text":"I genuinely can't say enough about this WOB location. The people, the service,  the food, the atmosphere, the cleanliness, the offers, THE BEERS... everything just deserves 5 stars.   Here's my top reasons and tips that you need to appreciate them to the fullest!   Reasons and Tips:   Food - Order anything or everything... especially during happy hour It's hard to not afford all of it if you have a partner in crime to share the load with. Follow them on facebook to keep up with their daily specials and pictures of new menu items. CALLING ALL VEGETARIANS, they've got you covered! I highly recommend the tavern tots, any burger, anything served with fries because they're unreal, sweet kale salad, the flat breads and anything on the brunch menu. (Also the brunch doesn't get any better $25 for an entree of your choice and unlimited beermosas, mimosas, and bloodymarys).  Beer - Do you even beer? Well if you do, download the app and sign up for a WOB account because you get all types of perks. My favorite being that the new kegs are updated practically real time on the app. They have an awesome rotating draft list, at any given hour during your visit a keg could go and they could throw a different one on there. Also keep an eye out on the infused beer. Daily they switch out the fruits in the clear infuser that adds a hint of sweetness and fruity flavors to their selected tap attached. [ask for a sample] That leads me to another thing SAMPLE SAMPLE SAMPLE! Not sure about it? Ask to taste! They're usually even ahead of the game and bring a few similar ones for you to try as well. Don't forge about the coolers too, they even will do cooler sales such as 50% off anything is cooler 1. The black board to the right of the beer coolers also usually has the specials written on there. Currently all Okotberfest beers are $5 and it's not just a little pint (Oct 2017).   Team - Those working there are absolutely amazing. Without going anywhere near daily I always feel welcomed back as if living I'm living in a small town. I specifically have to highlight the bartender Sarah who's been there since it opened and knows her beer (I owe you more tips girl because you're doing big things over there). Secondly I have to shout out the server Jeremiah because he was nothing but attentive when a few of us came to watch the mlb play offs. So much that when we mentioned we'd see him for the next game, he without us asking kindly reserved the couch seating area for us to watch again in the same spot. I couldn't be more thrilled with his thoughtfulness and really just for recognizing us. The manager on staff is also really kind, you'll often see him out pushing in chairs and running food to tables which is nice to see. He gave me a little heat about the dodgers but I can overlooked that since he always friendly. I'll have to return with two more bartender's names because they too are worth including! [I told you couldn't say enough about this place].  Atmosphere and Cleanliness: They have an awesome patio with soft lighting, a few fire pits with big chase lounge chairs, and some high top seating for couples and large groups. There's also a few outside bar seats that are awesome but you have to keep an eye out for those bad boys. The bar itself accommodates quite a few people and you can dine on the full menu there. I personally dine there most although I'm still waiting for purse hooks [hint hint]. They also have high top booth, regular booth and table that can accommodate larger groups as well. All with a great view of many TVs. My favorite spot though is the couch area just inside the door, it's like your own private living room with seating and a large coffee table for your food and drinks. The restaurant is spotless, I can't think of a time I've even seen a napkin or straw wrapper on the floor. The same goes for the restrooms as well."}
{"text":"World of Beer is excellent. FOOD IS AMAZING. THE STAFF IS TONS OF FUN. I'm proud to call them new friends. They are knowledgeable about their beer as there are nearly 575 beers here. Sunday bunch is amazing. Happy hour is great. They have accommodated all my needs to watch sports. So happy I found this place. TOO MUCH GOOD STUFF. If you love great food, amazing people, and the love of beer this is your place."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time.  The bartenders don't know beer; it's a playground for the beer distributors.    My wife and I stopped in for a drink on our anniversary and asked for a particular shot.  Not only did they not have the ingredients one bartender in particular tried to substitute another liquor then told us we didn't know then say we can't do that.  Normally I wouldn't critique but this hipster db seemed to go out of his way to be a certain way and I got annoyed.    We had great service at every other restaurant we visited at San tan.  The manager didn't seem to care and that was noticeable by the ample room in that bar vs every other bar in the area.  There are much better places at San tan to spend your money at."}
{"text":"A great place to get a large selection of beers. You can use the tablet to narrow down to exactly what you want. That's really nice and gives you more detail than a beer list.  The lunch menu is a bit small, but if you're just looking for something to eat with your drinks, I'd think it would be more than serviceable. I didn't see what the dinner menu was like, so perhaps it has more choices."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great selection of beer and good live music.  So if your wanting to try a variety of beers from all over this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"My first time here and I had the greatest experience. My server was chad, told him what beer style I liked and he ironically brought me all of my favorite beers without even knowing. Had a great time, and would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My go to place when going out with the boys. The entire staff always take care of us with their exceptional service.  Devin and Sarah rock the bar like I've never seen before and generally suggest some of the best beers I've ever had.   Would highly suggest checking the place out. Amazing food, great staff, outstanding beer selection"}
{"text":"Good service. Food selection isn't the best, not too many choices imo. But the place is family friendly, they have a small living room type of area with a tv and couches with bored games."}
{"text":"Place is good because it's world of beer.  They are all good but wow - the owner is one nasty , unhappy grouchy person.  Bartenders amazing.  Not sure how he has an employees watching the way he treats them."}
{"text":"9.10.2017 @ 1030am   This place is awe-sommeeeeee. I'm so glad we came here. We were greeted by the staff and the person helping us out was Pua? Sorry if i spelt that wrong. She was patient with our indecisive group. Since it was the first day of NFL we decided to get finger foods. (Plus we decided to binge all day)   We ordered three flights, 1. intro to hops, 2. Tour of Belgium 3. Intro to WOB flights. We all took turns tasting each sample and finished the one we choose. Yes it is worth it!!!  The finger foods we ordered were the nachos (with chili) 20 piece wings flavors parm chicken, spicy Korean and something that was sweet I forgot. Oh and tatertots. The wing sauces are made to order, pretty amazing. Everything we ordered was very good!! Tater tots were .. well taters lol can't go wrong. As far as the wings, begeezus.. So damn good. The nachos are finger lickin' good, I almost died tho.. jalapenos are kickin'!   What makes everything 10000000000x better is the amazing service we received! Pua (again sorry) John, Jen, some girl with short hair up to her shoulders managed to chime in with great service and checked on us. These people were the best part of our meal. They definitely made our experience worth while.  Hopefully we can catch the same crew on our next visit."}
{"text":"WOW!  What an awesome concept!  World of Beer is a fantastic place for us beer snobs.  Located right on South Blvd and Bland street.  There is street parking or there are spots if you turn onto Bland off South, in the parking garage behind WOB.  The interior is inviting with a very long bar, high-tops and low tops.  TONS of tvs to watch the game.  There is also a small patio with comfy seating outside too.  There are two menus - one of drafts and one of bottles.  The menus are organized by beer type!  Genius!    We stopped by here yesterday and grabbed a table outside.  Folks had their doggies runnin around - it was so relaxing and chill!  I had a great half and half ($6 bucks) - perfectly poured.  If you get hungry there is food available for delivery - see the spiral menu in the back.  The one complaint was that one of my friend's drinks was not charged properly when she got the bill.  Once she pointed it out to the waitress however, it was taken care of right away.  We will definitely be back!!!  :-D"}
{"text":"As the name implies, this place has a pretty large selection of beers, from ciders to stouts. We visited for the first time with some friends from out of town for Happy Hour. We started off sharing a giant pretzel. It comes with warm beer cheese and spicy, grainy mustard. Both were delicious. I had the tavern tots and the chimichuri meatballs. The tots are big with cheese sauce and jalapeños."}
{"text":"Mediocre.  Mediocre food. Mediocre service. The high point was my icy cold pineapple ale. My first order of fish was served way over cooked. The.batter was actually burnt. The second attempt was better but sloppyily plated and presented. Hubs chicken wings were mediocre.  Go for the beer - skip the food as it is mediocre. It is appropriately named World of Beers."}
{"text":"Seriously you have an amazing selection of beers! Now to ruin it...and then there are the large screen TV's everywhere set to whatever the sports game of the night is. God forbid if you ask them to turn up the sound. The owners say no to that. Unless you want to sit outside with the kids. Well guess what...I can find the same selection of beers elsewhere where the sound will be on..oh by the way the music is obnoxious to the point that you can't here the person next to you to discuss the beer you are drinking or whatever just happened on the game you were trying to follow on the tv...good by"}
{"text":"Love this place :))))))) I will recommend this place to all my Fiends Grate customer service we love it :::::))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))"}
{"text":"Huge selection of beers, I'm hardly a drinker so I was impressed by their selection. bar tender was very helpful even being as busy as she was. Let us flavor a couple samples so we got exactly what we wanted. I would say a good overall experience. Not a lot of seating but there is a balcony style seating above the bar & some limited patio seating. not bad just cramped quarters"}
{"text":"It's really cool environment to hang out at...the servers are knowledgeable in the menu and the bartenders will assist you with every question you have!"}
{"text":"From the time my family and i arrived Jason our server was great. His services were on point. He took care of us and we really appreciated that he went out of his way to make our time fun and special. Definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"I love quality beers & World Of Beer had so many quality beers to choose from.  The beers enough would make me come back to this place; however, the service was just as good.  Lastly, they have live music there too.  I must admit, I am not a fan of Mill Ave., World Of Beers is the only reason I will come back to Mill again."}
{"text":"Great food, good atmosphere, there is a dining room and a kids menu..  They don't answer the phone, I called 3x to see if they had a kids menu and not one person answered which I thought was weird.  Our server was helpful, there's good teamwork going on as we had multiple people helping us with clearing our plates and refilling our waters.. I don't remember his name but our server did help me make decisions on menu items although he hasn't tried everything he suggested what he thought was good and it was. My moms southwest burger was awesome and pretzel was good too.. my sliders were ok not amazing the crispy tacos were good .. loaded tater tots were alright, should have gone for something else after already having beer cheese with the pretzel..   Definitely want to check it out another time"}
{"text":"I am new to reviewing, but World of Beer on my 4th or 5th visit has prompted me to enter that realm!  The atmosphere, beer and food are fantastic, but the service by bartender Olivia is what made this visit yelp review worthy!  She makes fantastic drinks and when my beer wasn't cold enough, she made me my own private beer cooler, and put more on ice!  Her co-worker Nicole was awesome as well!  We were here for our first beerunch.  They put on whatever football game we wanted, encouraged us to yell anytime we needed anything and took great care of us all morning!   Every menu item we have had here has been excellent!  Giant pretzel, wings, cheese dip, huevos rancheros,  guiness beer brat and chicken and waffles!!  You must come, but don't take my spot, lol!!!!  :)  There are no pictures because we ate and drank it all!!"}
{"text":"One of the worst experiences, the hostess scolded the couple in front of us, and was irritated when we wanted to move to a different table. No one came over and offered water or take our beer orders. Menu is small, only breakfast items, one burger. Would've loved to try something but no one came over even met eyes with the hostess and walked past us. We got up and walked out!!! Thank you but no thank you"}
{"text":"My husband and I are beer snobs and came here a week after their grand opening. Awesome selection of beer, terrible service. Our waitress was slow and didn't know squat about beer. We came right at the beginning of happy hour and can I just say OVERPRICED!!!!  About an hour into happy hour this place got ridiculous! Very small space which we don't mind, buttttt this place gets ridiculously crowded and the slow service makes it even worse. Maybe we'll give this place another shot in the future, being right on Mill Ave doesn't help much....  Alas, go to Taste of Tops just around the corner, much better atmosphere and the waiters actually know their beers."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great place for a few beers and to watch football. Management is great and always accommodating. One of our favorite places to stop when we're looking for an evening out!"}
{"text":"Huge selection of beers on tap and even bottled. The only caveat is they might not have some of the on tap stuff. What do I mean?  Me: May I have the Dogfish Head brew?  BT: Sorry, we currently don't have that one.  Me: Okayyy... How about the Four Peaks beer?  BT: Yeah, we don't have that one either. We had a tasting event earlier and don't have those.  Good times. There are plenty of other places on Mill and Tempe with large beer selections that actually have inventory. Proceed to this place with caution!"}
{"text":"Awesome selection of craft beer at a decent price. Great pub food, might be a little slightly overpriced but is very delicious.  Great outdoor atmosphere and Ted the bartender was the absolute BEST!! Love you Ted!! If you are knew to craft beer this is the place to go as Ted will cater to your tastes and let you try anything before you purchase it."}
{"text":"I work close by and have walked by this place everyday...so I was excited when it finally opened.  After reading some of the Yelp reviews, I thought I better wait a good week or two before planning a work happy hour.  I thought 2 weeks would be sufficient, but the service was still very slow.  Our table had (3) different waitresses, which I think just confused our orders.  My beer order took awhile to get and it was a bottled beer....nothing that came from a tap.  Anyhow, several of my co-workers have already been here already and they all complained about the slow service.  Don't get me wrong, once we got our drinks they were very friendly...it just seemed a little unorganized.  The beer selection is excellent!  It's nice to see Arizona beers featured here.  Portland brews not taking all the spot light.  The place itself is small considering the building itself is big.  I thought the entrance of this place is weird...it's all fenced in..got to look for the opening..not very inviting. WOB does not serve any food.  You can order from surrounding restaurants, but such a hassle.  I guess they really believe Beer is Food....therefore, why serve anything else?  I will give this place another chance...since our work group needs our monthly \"team building\" and we like to stick around the Mill Ave. area.  I just hope the service improves and maybe down the road serve some kind of munchies."}
{"text":"80+ taps, 600+ bottles. You're sure to find some good beer.  I usually get a flight or two to try new beer. Pretzels are good, so are the onion rings. The bbq chicken flatbread is okay.   We like to sit outside when the weather is comfortable, wish the patio was bigger, but have never had a problem finding a spot. Service has never been a problem."}
{"text":"Great selection of craft beer and a friendly staff. Next time we go, we are going to try the beer flight sampler.  The whole place has a friendly vibe. Bathrooms are very clean. A place that really lives up to it's name \"world of beer\" and not really for the beer novice. Though they offer free beer classes, for the aspiring beer snob."}
{"text":"I walked in no one greeted me 15 minutes later I was finally told to have a seat anywhere I like. Keep in mind it was not busy. Right then I should have left. Finally I order my drinks and it takes over 30 mins for me to get them 45min later I get my food.  Order was all wrong .The waiter never came back until I was mad. I finally talked to the OWNER after he ignored me twice.  He then stated \"look here\" at the moment I flipped out left never eat the food or drinks and left. I suggest never go here horrible service and ownership."}
{"text":"Hmm, not good tonight. The pretzel with beer cheese, which is a stretch to begin with at 10 bucks, was dried out and extremely oversalted. The beer cheese is also not as good as it used to be, and tasted like it was borderline bad. Service was not great either. Beers were fine if not a bad expensive. Won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday, my cousin and an old classmate of mine. After sitting for 30 minutes finally a 'new' server comes and gives us coasters, takes our orders. I order food from Cheba Hut to be delivered. That would be about 45 minutes which is fine. 15 minutes later, same waitress comes back again to take our order. We told her she already took our order. So she leaves at this point it's been an hour. So we just got up and left, Which is a shame because they have such a vast variety to sample. Oh and the menu they gave us was days old, so when we did order we had to make 3 choices each because they were out of what we wanted. Their menu generally changes daily. We went to Mill Cue Club and I got my food re-routed. I agree with Taric. \"World of Clusterf---\""}
{"text":"I was pleased by the beer and the service. I went in on a Friday during happy hour. It was packed let me tell you. I went up to the bar and immediately I had a server asked what I wanted. I looked over their selection and asked what a good pale ale would be. She said to try the Odell 5 barrel, which was incredible. Multiple times I had servers come up to me and ask if I needed anything. They were super nice to me. They even gave me tastes of a few different beers. I will definitely be going back to this fine establishment."}
{"text":"Several beers on tap. I recommend California creamin if you're into a nice crisp afternoon beer. The buffalo wings are also amazing!"}
{"text":"An entirely respectable bar for beer-lovers, World of Beer introduced me to the unexpectedly amazing world of Arizona craft brew. You can't get this stuff where I'm from, so I was grateful I drove past and so the giant \"World of Beer\" sign, because a world of beer is precisely what I'm looking for most of the time, particularly when I travel. If you are indeed traveling to Phoenix, and you do indeed love beer, then World of Beer should certainly be one of your ports of call. It does have a \"bar\" ambiance, and a college bar ambiance at that. Which, to me, is less than appealing. But if you can get past that and possibly secure yourself a place to sit outside, you can enjoy your flights in peace, without having to listen to the dipshit conversations of the majority of the clientele. On the other hand, the dipshit quotient can work in your favor if you're just looking to get laid, which, I am informed, is no challenge at all in the greater Phoenix metro area for your average dude of average charm. Try to avoid talking too much about \"hops\" if this is your angle, beer geeks.  Helpful, friendly bar staff, but I can't say for sure they know what they're talking about. Luckily, you can hardly go wrong with Arizona beer. I recommend anything from Oak Creek to start. Delicious stuff."}
{"text":"Super cool spot to hang out and if you're looking for a unique beer you've come to the right place.  This place is so new, you can smell the new leather on the stools and chairs the minute you walk through the door.  I can see this place being very busy as the summer progresses.  It's located right below a condo and aparment complex and I would guess to say that the locals make up at least 50% of the people there, so as you can imagine it can and likely will be a hot spot.    The service was adequate, all be it, a bit slow.  They seemed a bit under staffed when we were there so I wasn't too upset.  I think this place is probably on the downside of some hurdles in terms of getting the machine well oiled.    They have live music weekly and even though the patio is fairly small, it makes a great hangout spot with very comfy furniture.  They can also open windows to allow free flow air into the interior space which is nice during those cozy summer nights."}
{"text":"Improvements need to be made quickly, if they hope to survive here.  I love the concept of this place, great beer in no short supply!  The location is cool, they the vault from the bank that occupied the space before and converted it into an awesome dining/party room.  The downsides of the World of Beer, though are the prices are very steep, although somewhat close the the median of what is Mill Ave.  The real disappointment though, is the service.  It took upwards of 5-10 minutes to get a drink on a Monday night when the place was moderately busy, at best.  We also got our requests for water ignored not once, but twice and an unapologetic attitude when we brought it up a third time.  Service needs to improve, and unless I hear that it does drastically, I do not plan on returning."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed at all with anything.  Usually go to Kona since they are consistent on food and service.  Decided to give this a go for a change.  Overpriced on everything including the beer.  We were told the menu was brand new.  I explained this to a friend and she said the menu was small and pricey, I guess nothing has changed.  There's hardly anything on the menu and it doesn't offer anything really appetizing.  I didn't see a burger on there so I ordered the beef sliders.  The bun to meat ratio was ridiculous.  They were tasty thanks to the horseradish sauce.  Fries were not cooked enough but seasoned well.  Beer is not served cold nor are the glasses chilled, especially when you order a bottle, you'd think the glasses would be chilled.  The beer prices are high especially for having so much inventory.  I get they are trying to be a high end pub with exclusive beers and higher end food but it just doesn't work.  It's a bit of a dive walking into the establishment and they should serve pizza, burgers, chicken sandwiches etc."}
{"text":"I have only gone to their happy hour! ITS THE BOMBBB. All my classmates go there after we celebrate an exam lol  -HH is Mon-Friday 2pm-7pm & Sun-Thursday 9pm-close -They have a nice indoor + outdoor seating -Located outside the galleria mall and next to GEN KBBQ  HH DRINKS 5/5: -Bad Beat Bluffing Isn't Weisse (Hefeweizen; $4): super refreshing, this is my favorite beer here! -Woodchuck Amber (Cider; $4): if you like something that is not too bitter, this is the beer for you. Pretty sweet also :)  HH FOOD 5/5: -Tavern Taters ($5): OMG these are to die for. The tots are fried in such a crunchy/delicious manner. It's topped with jalapenos, bacon, ranch, and ALOT OF CHEESE. my favorite :D  -Magherita Flatbread ($5): Super yummy pizza. -Mac & Cheese bites ($5): These are good too. -All their HH food is share-able, so they are HUGE."}
{"text":"I like going to WOB for drinks.  Their cucumber martini is really good and worth a try!  They have lots of beer options like you would expect.   The service tends to be less than average especially for a place that doesn't serve food."}
{"text":"Been multiple times, always had mixed service. Sometimes had a good time, yesterday was ignored at the bar for 10 minutes. My friends and I left after standing at the bar waiting to be helped. It wasn't busy and there was no real reason to be ignored. Won't be back for a while."}
{"text":"I love this place! Sarah, Devon, and Pua are always amazing and helpful with any questions I have and make the environment very friendly. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Had a really rough experience visiting this restaurant from out of town (Chicago) this past weekend. First, our party of 10 arrived a few minutes before our noon reservation and the solo waitress on staff didn't seem to know anything about that reservation and just told us to it anywhere. Because the restaurant had its garage doors open to the outside, some flies started to annoy us as soon as we sat down. Our waitress was accommodating when she took our order and agreed to do individual checks, but she did not bring us water until several people in our party asked for some (this might be company policy though, not sure).   When our food arrived, so did the flies. There were as many as 10 flying around annoying us. It seemed like it would have been a good idea for the restaurant to keep the door and garage doors closed to keep out flies, especially since it was only in the upper 60s and was rather chilly in the restaurant. The other issue was that the food arrived for 8 people, but not 2 of us. The 2 of us without food waited at least 10 minutes for our food to come out, at which point our friends were all done eating. Our waitress offered us free beers, but we were about to leave to drive 3 hours home, our friends were all done with their meals, and we hadn't even ordered beer to begin with, so we declined. When our bills came later, we saw that we had not been comped anything or received any kind of discount. Because I was so annoyed at this point, I asked if we could have some kind of discount since our food had been so delayed. Our waitress said she would go ask her manager and left with all of the checks/cards instead of leaving 8 of the bills/cards on the table for people to sign and just taking the 2 bills back that might potentially get adjusted. As a result, when she came back, the discount had been applied to the wrong check, and she had to take them back to fix them.   By the time she returned I was only offered a 10% discount, which, as my friend pointed out, was far below the cost of the free beer I had been offered. All told, I got to sit and watch my friends eat for 10 minutes, and then they got to sit and watch me eat for 10 minutes, and I only got about $1.50 taken off my bill.   Don't get me wrong: the food was delicious here, but the service and fly-ridden atmosphere could have been improved. It seems like they were understaffed with only 1 waitress and 1 bartender working at noon on a Sunday during football season, so I'm guessing management is to blame."}
{"text":"Second time I have been to this place for beer and wings. The beer is really good with tons to choose .  The wings have been a real let down . They are really wet and soggy and greasy.  I ordered garlic parm extra crispy , we got wet soggy garlic .  The blue cheese is really really good but they need to focus on getting the wings right because the consistency sucks. Maybe, if you get drunk enough you won't notice. Service also is soggy like the wings."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I am a beer snob and I have ZERO issue paying a premium for, good food or drink. However their beer, which is why you come here, is WAY overpriced. While they offer quality and selection, paying $9 for what you can get at 5 other places in town for $5 is a bit much.   Service can make up for some of that, but try do not excel at that either.   Middleton and the West side have been in need a good spot for good beer, but there are now places that offer some of the same hard to find brews at a much better price. On that note happy hour was a joke, I'll take my money to Vintage, Freehouse, Craftsman, and Mr Brews."}
{"text":"Surprisingly great spot. I've been in twice and the prices, food, staff, and beers were really good. I would definitely recommend and will be back. They also only allow smoking outside which I really liked for a Nevada bar."}
{"text":"Great place, I like this place a lot we will for sure keep coming back thank you to jeremiah for the invite, and because you were so nice to stop by my table and say to me and all my friends. is really a nice surprise that they have 500 beers for any style I like that let you taste the beer. Food servers are nice, friendly and on top of that I was so lucky and I get life music..."}
{"text":"This started out as the place to hang but it has changed a bit. Still good beer selection but the food isn't anything extraordinary. Food is also pricey for what you get. They took a lot off their happy hour so it's not even worth it. I missed the calamari D=  However, overall the food and service is still good. I just feel it is not as good as when it opened."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I have to say I am very disappointed. My boyfriend and I decided to try something new and find a place where we could watch football. The atmosphere is nice and inviting, but the selection of beers is lacking. We asked for about 6 different beers that they don't even have...World of beer my ass. I ordered a Bloody Mary that was overpowered with ice and spice. So I changed my selection to a mimosa instead....about 90% OJ. When i asked the server for a mimosa with Champaign in it, her reply was \"oh sorry it's because we are almost out\" So I get screwed on the drink that I paid for? Nice! The only reason i am giving this place 2 stars is because the chicken and waffles was Bomb and our server was actually really sweet and attentive. Other than that, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Horrible! Horrible! Management! We went there several hours ago to have lunch. We needed outdoor seating because one of our kids is sick, but the manager said there was no room because they have a party of 18. The patio is HUGE! More people can fit in the patio! He just wasn't accommodating at all! Never ate there, will not now!"}
{"text":"Good selection of beer and the staff was pretty helpful and nice.  We went during happy hour and the tacos were really good. We also did the local beer flight and it was fun to try all the different beers from our area.  We will for sure be back to try some more beers sometime."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday!  Excellent tacos especially for $2.50 and $4.00 beers make this a great Tuesday night!"}
{"text":"I'm reviewing on the pretty awesome sun-thur happy hour which I'm a fan of..big FAN of!  Service:  I've always say at the bar for the evening happy hour and the bartenders have all been great.  Always checking on your drinks and food to make sure everything is going well.  Food & Drinky Drinks: The beers I've ordered on draft off the happy hour menu have always been cold, optimally stored and never flat.  My favorite happy hour foods all at $5 Margherita Flatbread:  Tasty and great value for the price.   Mac & Cheese Bites: 6 bites that work very well with the dipping sauce Crispy Chicken Sliders: you get 2 sliders  and the chicken is flavorful All the happy hour food specials is great drinking food especially with beer, go figure  Ambiance: Lots of big TVs above the bar which can be seen throughout the whole establishment.  It gives off a PT's Gold vibe: Local, clean, contemporary with lots of dark wood.  I'm love seeing all the different bar taps and the impressive fridges of bottled beer for the sampling  This is a place for beer drinkers as the selection is fantastic.  The food has always been good to great and I've never had any issues.  I love how the menus provide information on calories and what type of beer would pair best with the entrees.  I totally appreciate them making me a better foodie through their menu.  I think it's time for a non-happy hour visit to try pair up a main entree with their beer suggestions and I'm excited to try that.  But that's another yelp tale....=)"}
{"text":"Visited here last week and had a fantastic experience!  It's smaller/intimate and has a limited menu - but it keeps the focus on the fantastic beer selection which I love.  Following the photos of other posters we got the humongous pretzel and were not disappointed!!  Bartenders were very busy but extremely attentive - never had to wait for a refill and they were very knowledgeable/made great recommendations based upon the tastes of those in my party.  Great combo of televisions for sports and secluded tables for conversation.  Prices were really great for a selection of this variety.  Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times had a decent experience. The beer selection is vast, which I like. I did find it was a bit overpriced for being on Mill, but not terribly so. The only issue I have is the layout of the place. Often times it's hard to find a place to sit, even when it's not really crowded. And when it is really crowded - you're SOL. Service seemed fine, but I have only ordered from the bar, so I can't say what it's like during any other time. I like this place!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time a couple days ago. The service was terrific, but the prices were quite steep. Between my friend and I, we had 2 Belgian beers for a grand total of $26 before tip. I realize that Belgian beers are more expensive, but that's the most I've paid for them. Probably will not come back anytime soon due to the hefty prices."}
{"text":"For a beer enthusiast, like myself this is heaven. Though they may not have 'everything' that have quite a bit to choose from to please any palate. The manager that was on duty at the time, was extremely helpful in determining new beers for me to try and provided tasters before I committed to a pint.  If you're looking for a unique spot and want to keep it strictly to the hops and barley- definitely check this spot out."}
{"text":"A cool place to order a wide variety of beer. The prices are pretty good (compared to places like the yard house). Ordered the fruit cocktail ... was soo bomb :)   The only thing I didn't like was that that they didn't have that many international beers (mainly only mexico). Also, the menu should be listed by beer region."}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for this place.  Firstly, it's too small for Fri and Sat night crowds. It was literally elbow to elbow in there. It looked like they have some sort of balcony area above the bar (?), If that wouldve been open, it wouldve been 10 times more bearable.  We stopped in this past Friday night and man were the douches out in force. W/ in the 1st 5 minutes after getting drinks my friends boyfriend was rammed into and had his beer spilled all over him, and watched as a couple who'd moved their stools away from one of the tables proceeded to say \"Were using that table!\" to anyone who tried to just lean against it. I got the impression from the clientele that they were just there to try whatever brew had the highest alcohol content rather than try different/ new beers, but thats what a location on Mill brings I guess. Its still disappointing for those of us that like craft beer for craft beer, not for how wasted we can get in one sitting.  To say that their beer list is overwhelming is an understatement. I kinda felt like there shouldve been a companion to their beer book (which was listed by type of beer) that was listed by country like at certain karaoke bars (by artist/ song title). I realize that their fridges are set up by country but we could barely squeeze in at the bar to order, let alone peruse the cases on either side of the taps.  Unlike Kate K., not one server stopped to ask if we needed anything. However, once we got past the 2 girls that were just hanging out at the bar taking up space (\"Cuz this is where the scene is\"), the bartender was quick to take and get us our order.  I'd like to go back here during happy hour on a weekday or maybe right when they open on a Sat to give it another shot, because I really want this place to be awesome."}
{"text":"Happy hour not so happy when it takes over 40 minutes and my food is not out yet. Not to mention I've ordered off the happy hour menu!   Finally got one item, cold onion rings now where's the rest?"}
{"text":"Unfortunate. I really wanted to love this place. Great location and beer selection but that's it. Horribly ridiculous service. Went there yesterday with friends and was disappointed. Menu kinda sad, service worse, music selection...odd. I know they just opened, hopefully just working out the bugs. Not sure if I will even give them another try. Just not special."}
{"text":"Not a lot of 'there' there.  Biggest complaint - the order of nachos was really small...for an order of nachos.  Tasted fine, but way overpriced.  I looked around and many of the portions were smaller; looked at the menu...prices all higher.  Bad mix. I guess they have a lot of beers but most are in bottles/cans.  If you're looking for a variety of tap beers you'll do just as well at many other restaurants around town.   Their coolers used to be loaded with an impressive array but are now half-empty.  I suspect most of their customers, like me, were over the \"we have a million beers\" thing after their first visit and all their packaged beer just got old.  Yet...there was something about those packed coolers that made World of Beer more...beery And SO loud.  Bad acoustics, I guess. And service was ho-hum.  They weren't trying too hard. OK I'm done."}
{"text":"Such a great place to just sit down with friends and try some drinks ! Food was great and the customer service is outstanding ! Everyone was so great and our server Derrinca was definitely wonderful !"}
{"text":"Killer beer selection, approx 50 draft beers and 300 bottles. Full bar too. Its located in the epicentre uptown. Menu consists of all the basics, wings, burgers, mac and cheese bites, and flatbread pizzas... I ordered the bbq chicken flatbread and shared it. It was great! Sweet bbq sauce with cheese, bacon, peppers, and green onions. Everything is brand new inside, clean modern, very charlotte-esque."}
{"text":"IF YOU PARK ON THE STREET AND IT TURNS 11:01PM - YOU'RE SCREWED  That's the 1st lesson I'll tell you because dammit, I wish someone had told me that when I went here! Signs are sparce but it's true - don't park on the street or if you do, move your car before the clock strikes 11. Our waitress told us around 11:20 that we should move our cars, but alas - it was too late for my poor Jetta wagon. 11:01, yours truly got a ticket. So mad! Apparently the staff knew but none of the patrons did, as well all came back from moving our cars with sad looks on our faces.  To the beer and service, this place is very good. I am not sure how often they clean their beer lines since my brown ale had notes of pumpkin when I was last in (a few weeks after Thanksgiving), but overall it's a good place close to Uptown with a large variety of beers, tons of TVs and some large corner booths for friends to gather!"}
{"text":"A great place to be at to check out the ASU hotties : ) and many beers.   That's all I remember and the hot weather."}
{"text":"Great spot for the beer lovers of the world. Staff is great and Anna is a excellent bartender. She knows her stuff and she has excellent knowledge of beer. Amazing atmosphere and food is to die for. Anything you want to know about beer ask these guys they know their stuff. Cheers to many more pours at World of Beer Tempe!"}
{"text":"Came here with the boyfriend and his basketball team while we were in town for a tournament. Conveniently located near the Marriott hotel. Great atmosphere for good food and drinks! We got wings, shrimp tacos, and meatballs. Everything was yummy. I ordered a blood mary and it was made very well. Almost ordered a second one. First time at WoB and it was a good experience!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! It has the packed, friendly feel of a neighborhood bar, but no neighborhood bar will have such an amazing selection of beers!   We arrived around 6:45 on a Friday and were able to get seated right away. It's bar-like in that there isn't a hostess to seat you but any of the wait staff will be happy to help you find a spot. It definitely got packed by 8pm though, so don't get here too late if you want a seat! I found the staff to be very friendly and helpful and they kept an eye out for the Eddie 'n' Eddies waitress and made sure she came to us.   Some people have complained about the face that WOB doesn't serve its own food, but why would that be a problem when you can bring in food/have it delivered from anywhere (like the Chipotle a block away) plus they have a partnership with Donato's, Jimmy John's, Dave's Cosmic Subs, and Eddie 'n' Eddie's? You don't ever have to worry about having bad food! Two people at our table ordered Donato's and the rest of us got burgers, pie, and the pretzel and cheese appetizer.   Now for the beer: SUCH A GREAT SELECTION. The descriptions are great and even if you're a beer connoisseur, you may have some fun reading up on the different options. I was with a few beer snobs and one guy was so excited to find quality English beer. I also don't think they were that pricey; it's maybe a dollar or two more than the Wink (max) and a much better selection.   My only regret is that I live too far from WOB to go there spontaneously, so I won't be going there as often as I'd like to."}
{"text":"I'm a HUGE beer lover so I was dissapointed after going to this place twice. Yes, they have a ton of beers, but for a craft beer place, you are better off with Yard house.   The service is terrible so get ready to finish your beer and wait forever for your next. Maybe they want you to double fist since this is an ASU area bar.  Speaking of which, the prices are very high for this area, so not sure how a college kid could afford it.  Looking for food? Look somewhere else. Went with my non-drinking friend who ordered a coke......guess what, they dont have straws! Want a napkin? They dont have them readily available. Could not even get a coaster so the table was a watery mess.  Overall, if you are looking to drink yourself to death with beer only, not eat anything, slip and slide all over yourself, and then wipe your mouth on your sleeve, then this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Beer is great international type as well as some good domestic. Costly though food is so so again costly probably due to its location tied into the Mall. Service was excellent with a smile I will be back. It is trendy with some good people going"}
{"text":"This is a very mediocre for a WOB. I've been to a few, my favorite is the one located in Raleigh. It seems that had way more of a selection and the bartenders were super quick. This one lacks in variety (they do however have several local brews, I just prefer the brewery experience) and the service is slow. I will be back, I just hope they have rotated the taps by then."}
{"text":"GREAT selection of Beer.  Good setup with live music, food trucks, and events going on all the time. Lots of TVs to catch every game that's on. Overall, it's a great place to grab a drink!"}
{"text":"Waffled between meh and okay and decided to round up. First, the positives: + my pesto margherita sandwich was tasty, if nothing special + lots of beer choices (surprising considering the name, huh?) + when I visited, there was a check-in offer for a free taster, so I gave a blueberry beer a try + the open-air feel is nice in the warm weather  Things that were a bit of a bummer: - super slow service - prices felt high  - live music was super loud even though it was an acoustic singer/songwriter; we could barely hold a conversation - did I mention the slow service?   This was a one and done for us so I can't say if we just had a particularly slow/absent server or if it was just a bad night, but the combo of the concert-loud music, somewhat higher prices, and poor service hasn't inspired us to give it another go."}
{"text":"Good service (kateland), expensive but excellent selection. And easy delivery of food from local eateries.  Sports heavy but easy to ignore."}
{"text":"I've been there 4 times now. A random Thursday afternoon,  a Wednesday night, and 2 Saturday afternoon/evenings. No matter how busy it was, I always had prompt service. They are great with recommendations and are cool with letting you sample beers. The app is awesome for tracking what beers you've had & lets you make notes!  Inside is nothing great, it's kinda small. I love the patio bar- when you can get a seat. You've gotta try the giant pretzel & upgrade to cheese unless you're a mustard fan. The sliders are ok, although next time I'm ordering them without mustard- it overpowered the brat."}
{"text":"The first time I came here, the food was good, the drink was good; however, I did not enjoy the service. The server was very slow and he was just never taking care of our needs promptly. However, the last time I went, the waitress was very kind and assisting with all our needs, so I had to give them back the star.   They have a variety of beer selections to choose from, and also their tots are probably one of the best in town. I really love the surroundings, the ambiance is really nice. I wish they had one near where I live-southwest- to enjoy it more often, but I would not mind coming here after work and enjoy some good beer and food. Definitely a place to try out if you are in the area, or even if you are not the area."}
{"text":"The loaded tater tots with beer cheese were amazing. Shrimp tacos were really good too. And the waiter recommended an amber ale for my husband that he absolutely loved. Good food, good service, good beer!"}
{"text":"Off work and out of traffic? Eat a light dinner, doll yourself up, and come unwind with an adult beverage of sorts!   Even got gluten-free beers & ciders for days! If you get Jeremy as your bar tender tip him extra well!"}
{"text":"I've done Trivia Tuesday here in the past which was fun.  This time it was a few drinks and a quick bite to eat.  They have a long curving length of bar with bar stools sweeping around the right side and high and low table seating sprinkled through the rest of the floorplan.  It's very open and airy with high ceilings.  I've never felt crowded even on a busy trivia night.  They have individual tables large enough for 8 to 10 people so it's good for groups.  I don't actually drink beer so I can't comment on the brew selection. I do, however, appreciate the short list of cider, mead, and even a lambic they carry.  They also have a decent amount of cocktails, mixed drinks and wine so dispite the name there's plenty here for those of us who don't drink beer.  The street tacos are amazing!  The shrimp is my favorite, followed closely by the beer brined chicken.  They also have a beef option but I didn't care for that one...I'm not one for red meat though.  That's as far as I've made it on their menu because, when the tacos are that good why go any farther?  Ok, I'll admit,  I want to check out their Beerunch some weekend in the future.  Check back for my review on that!  Ample parking, especially at night when the other shops in the strip mall close.    Restrooms are clean and spacious although they are dark.  Not, like, spooky check the corners dark but more like dark finishes and fixtures...definitely a masculine feel but that doesn't really bother me.  It's only a restroom after all.  The staff was friendly and service was decent although a bit slow on busy nights, like during trivia.  All in all a nice bar.  I could see becoming a regular here."}
{"text":"Zillions of imports    Kinda like CarMax of beer..  Okay, so like hundreds of beers on tap. crazy good beers with crazy names that you will not remember after the first two because imports are so dang strong. I have been here twice for happy hour. I can only tell you that you will have the opportunity to taste/drink beer you have never heard of and you will stagger out onto Mill Ave and begin fighting with all the homeless people just because.  The next day you will see the bruises and your friends will tell you the tales of World of Beer.   Personally I did not start a fight but I did stagger and I did witness an argument. Brought on I am sure by strong imported beer. Which can  be good, just take a cab is all. The Tempe cops have their eyes on you here. Because they should.   The food was not memorable though I think I tasted something fried and maybe a hot pretzel. But does it really matter? This is world of beer, where you will have to fight your way up to the crowded bar for each glass and push past the \"tasters\" who are pretending they are tasting but they are actually drinking for free. I am allowed to say that because I was one of them.   A truly fun place."}
{"text":"Came here a couple weeks ago with my Husband food was okay had to send back pizza the dough was raw couldn't find server for at least 10 mins had to wave down another server to let her know about pizza never got refills and trying To get a check was very hard server was Nowhere to be found I could have walked out of there came back in walked out came Back in she would Of never known or cared probably rest of food was delicious the restaurant was clean bathrooms clean husband said the beer was nice and cold tasted great"}
{"text":"I have to give this place at least a solid 3.5 for beer alone.  The beers are unique and plentiful here, and we happened to come on a night with some great drink specials.  I love to try new beer, and this is definitely the kind of place to come if you want to do that.  The draft beers are listed alphabetically on a separate menu, and then you get a larger, more organized list of beer they offer in bottles.  It's quite extensive.  My friend lives in the complex and we couldn't wait for it to open.  When we actually got there, I was surprised by now big it was in there.  They have a large bar with a lot of stools, a decent amount of tables, and even a small patio outside.  They have a couple of large windows they open when the weather is nicer, which brings in a great breeze.  We came on a Wednesday in the early evening, so it was a pretty light crowd there.  Service was really nice the night we came.  But I do have a few teensy complaints.  First off, all the tables indoors are the high tables with bar stools.  This is not terribly comfortable for short people like me.  However, the night we came wasn't terribly busy or overly hot outside, so we moseyed outside to the fairly comfy outdoor chairs.  I can also see some problems with parking on the weekends.  They offer a bit of space you can park in the apartment garage as well as some street parking, but this place usually already has a pretty full lot.  That being said, it's located right at a Light Rail stop, so you can always park somewhere else and take the rail in.  Finally, they don't serve food, but we saw a lot of people bring their own, so apparently that's allowed there.  I saw on their Facebook page that occasionally they bring in outside food for larger events.    On a typical weeknight, this is my kind of place - I imagine Beer Heaven would look a little like this.  However, just beware of some difficulty with parking on evenings when it is really busy."}
{"text":"Conveniently located just on the outside of the Galleria Mall in Henderson, I must say that I just love the quality of service and great food/drinks that I receive from this establishment. The staff is always super friendly and efficient. The host always gets us seated quickly and the servers are extremely knowledgeable in the selection of beer they carry. They will help you find an impeccable brew to pair with your delicious meal. Our server even let me sample one of their sweeter beers and I swear that beer tasted just like a bowl of fruit loops! They have indoor and outdoor seating, plus a large beer and food menu so there's something for everyone to enjoy. Definitely recommend trying this place out if your in the henderson area."}
{"text":"Obviously a great beer selection but the staff seemed aloof when I was there.  It took awhile for anyone to acknowledge my existence.  If I was in the San Tan Village shopping area and wanted to grab a beer I'd have a lot of choices.  This isn't a bad one but I don't know that I'd seek it out specifically.  It does have a great setup with a small patio and large indoor area.  Great seating for groups and they do have specials displayed plainly."}
{"text":"I am extremely happy with this place. I haven't met one bartender who hasn't been extremely helpful and friendly! I didn't have high expectations for the food but I ordered a steak plate and was blown away by the quality and flavor. They even cooked it for me before the time the menu said it was available. Always a great time here! It is the best bar on this side of town."}
{"text":"Absolutely a great place to enjoy some brews after work. Has a plethora of different beers that I'm sure everyone would like. It can get a little crowded, but that's to be expected. Bartenders were friendly, and the doorman was hilarious and easy to talk to. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The beer was great but the service was horrible!!!!! The waiter couldn't wait to get rid of us, and go on his phone and not give us service. I hope it's not because we where the only Latinos in the bar. Never had such bad service in my life."}
{"text":"Kenny Crumpton loves this place...lol  I was excited to find a new place that had a killer beer selection and that supports LOCAL beer made in Ohio and more specifically, Cleveland.  Most recent trip was during beer week.  Each day was a tap takeover from a different brewery!  Killer beer selection and not priced as high as most other places with the same beers.  I cannot believe what some people will pay for a craft beer these days.  If people stop paying these B.S. prices places will drop their prices...  I feel Im getting bent over every time I order a micro when Im out.  For a drink that has essentially 4 ingredients, its robbery.  Crack is cheaper per ounce...  We had a couple of draught beers and all tasted fresh and beer lines are clean.  The bad part of this place is the servers..they are lame.  The last one we had had ZERO personality.  Dropped off our drink menus and went and stood at the end of the bar to talk to the \"manager\" dude and his buddy.  Took us about 10 minutes to get a beer when there couldnt of been more that 12 people in the place.  As we were leaving we see the same manager smoking outside with customers.  So professional!  This place drips with cheese..  I just get the feeling from the employees that Its more of a lame W. 6th club-type place than a beer mecca."}
{"text":"I love the fact that they have such a large selection of beer on tap but honestly I have not found too many too be distinctive beers.  Normal stuff you can find everywhere... Was hoping to find \"world\" of beers.  I do like the atmosphere and they have the outside open patio to the bar that is awesome"}
{"text":"Came here for our 2 year anniversary. The fried Mac n cheese was bomb! Totally recommend it! The Bf ordered some type of beer that tastes like blueberry pancakes (which was amazing) and the bartender recommended a mule drink with ginger beer! It was so good! Ambiance was nice! Next time I'd come here with my girlfriends. As far as our main entree.. I ordered the Korean Bibimbap has no flavor at all, no sauce that went with veges the meat was flavorful. Bf got the steak with fries he loved it! But I would not recommend the Korean Bibimbap bowl. Other than that, We'd love to come back and try other beers and that fried Mac n cheese tho!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but the service just ruined it.   I went on a sunday afternoon, when it really wasn't that busy. I was sitting directly at the bar and still got poor service. The server walked by probably 5 times while my glass set empty before she made eye contact with me. It was a bit ridiculous.   I feel like the yardhouse had just as many (if not more) taps, with the same prices and better service.   Great decor though, very tall open ceilings and lots of TVs. Just don't expect good service."}
{"text":"Great service and very friendly staff. Make sure you get the Mac n cheese bites they will change your life!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the service is VERY inconsistent. I'd recommend you sit at the bar where the bartender will serve you delicious beers and specialty cocktails in a timely manner. The one we had was also friendly and helpful.  Last time I was here, we were at a table. There was one other table and a handful of people at the bar, so it was a slow night. The server was very bad. She was not very friendly and didn't answer most of our questions about beers and drinks. When we asked what she would recommend, she kept saying \"I don't know.\" Then, when I was ready for a second drink, I had to flag her down after I saw her for the first time in 10 minutes. She was just generally unpleasant.  They do have a ton of variety, though I wish their beer list was organized by types instead of geographic origin. They also have AWESOME cocktails. I love the cucumber martini (and I am normally NOT a savory drink person) and the Dirty Ginger. This place is also comparatively expensive when Lakewood has a ton of great dive bars. It's a decent place to come for something different, if you sit at the bar."}
{"text":"If you like sours, try that Logsdon Bretta one time ... New Belgium Le Terroir pretty good too"}
{"text":"My mom and i went here to watch Game 3 of the Stanley cup series and left after the 1st period bc it was so cold. We asked someone to turn the fans down, but they only did for about 5 minutes. Food was good but SO COLD and for what reason? COLD AF. Like we left bc it was THAT cold. So maybe bring some snow gear when you choose to come here? I know i will be the next time i come."}
{"text":"They had a 4 comedians come in and do stand-up on Friday night for an hour than also had a singer/guitarist play for at least an hour after that. Got to love the free entertainment, however get there early the place was packed, there was no place to sit!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Loved the amazing selection of beer. Lots of TVs. The owner sat and talked with us for a while. New favorite place on mill."}
{"text":"Great beer, good food, and wonderful service! Perfect combination! Steven hooked us up with the NCAA game on one tv and cartoons for the kids on another tv.  Awesome experience all around! Definitely the spot to visit every time we're in Tempe."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge beer person just because I don't have a taste for it, but it was nice that you get to sample beers for free. I ended up getting a mead which was delicious! My boyfriend got a flight that was a little heavy for his taste, but enjoyed it anyway. My friend got a coffee and vanilla beer mixed and that was pretty good.   Our server was pretty great. We only asked for suggestions, not beer history so can't really grade it on knowledge. It was fun.   The food was pretty tasty, but a little pricy considering we only got appetizers."}
{"text":"Nice little happy hour. Lots of different beers but still some good wine for me. Happy hour sliders especially since the grilled the chicken like I requested instead of frying like the usually do. Husband had the tacos which he said was yummy. Great location."}
{"text":"It's your average sports bar, just with more beer. The staff seemed pretty inattentive when I went, and the noise levels rose astronomically when the band began, but the menu was pretty extensive. Not any place I would frequent again, but ok in a pinch."}
{"text":"We went to one of their \"Tap Takeover\" nights. We were mainly there for the beer they had on tap that night from Jackie O's Brewery. We wouldn't have been there otherwise. Beer was great and they have a good selection of many different kinds of beers. Overall just wasn't impressed with the atmosphere or the service. It was slow and they were moody - including the delivery guy we had bring us some sandwiches. I would go back if they had a beer I couldn't find anywhere else."}
{"text":"What a horrible experience with non-friendly staff and an owner that threatened to call the cops on me for not continuing to purchase drinks.  Then followed me out to the parking lot and stared at me while I was on the phone to my parents.  They said he was trying to intimidate me.  I have a disability and don't understand these kind of people.  This guy did not try to understand me for sure.  He did not want \"people like you\" in his bar.  He seems unhappy with his job."}
{"text":"Stopped in and had a few before the ASU game. I had some Pig Wings which were really good!"}
{"text":"The food is average with the exception of the Tavern Taters (exceptional!) but the beer selection is fantastic. We love ordering flights to test out new brews, and there are always delicious stouts on tap. I have been a number of times and never had a bad experience!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot to go when I'm hungry, and I need good food and beer as soon as possible. It's located at the Galleria Mall, but the entrance is on the outskirts of the mall so you don't have to worry about entering the mall period. It's a spacious spot, and they have booths, tall tables, you can sit outside and play some games, or just eat at the bar! On my most recent visit my boyfriend and I were sat down, and we didn't think we waited very long at all to be served. But our waiter was very apologetic about the wait, and continued to check up on us throughout our dinner. That goes to show they have a standard of their own! I always end up getting the two crispy chicken sliders with a side of fries. It's great for your pocket during happy hour which is Monday to Friday during 2-7pm and Sunday to Thursday during 9 to closing."}
{"text":"This only gets one star and that's still pushing it. I went there with an open mind and a thirsty craving. I left fully discussed and upset. I waited for 10 mins to be served and this was not a day that was popping, the server felt he had more important customers to flirt with and co workers to mess around with. Once he came and asked it was short and no help. I went with one of my local fav big blue van. He served me a can beer in a regular mug like it was sitting on the counter. I'm sure my beer in can was colder than the mug. My girlfriend was look at menu with food on it and just decided not to get anything do to seeing how are service was and how we were greeted. This is by far a horrible and unfriendly place place that I will never recommend. If asked they will get this same message."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a Saturday afternoon beer or 3.  It's a nice layout but it is strictly a bar specializing in beer.  No food but they may do a food truck outside at busier times.  The beer selection is great from breweries all over the world and they have a great selection of North Carolina beers with at least 3 of the big 4 breweries in Charlotte (NoDa, OMB, Birdsong and Triple C).  I wlll say I think their prices are bit high.  $6.50 for a pint of Jade IPA from Foothills?  It's a somewhat local beer.  I don't get it...  Staff-wise, the bartender was great but it looked like she was the only one there.  She was happy to recommend different beers.    But with so many breweries and other beer joints that also have food, I cannot see myself coming back here too often."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of WOB! WOB is located at Galleria Mall right next to GEN Korean BBQ.  I met some friends here last month to watch a MSU basketball game. This place is spacious with dim lighting and heigh ceilings with plenty of seating (tables, high tops, bar, patio...). Lots of TV screens as well so a great bar for watching sports!   We arrived during Happy Hour, which had pretty decent offers: - Mon - Fri, 3P - 7P - Reverse HH Sun - Thurs, 10P - Close  - $4 draft beer selection - $5 appetizers  - $6 cocktails and wine   We shared some small bites - the Tavern Tots, Chimichurri Meatballs, and the Mac & Cheese. All tasty bar apps. My friend and I were such fatties we actually ended up ordering a second round of Tavern Tots. No regrets!  I got the Hefeweizen (Bad Beat Bluffing Isn't Weisse) for my first two drinks then switched over to the White Sangria. The Hef was excellent and the Sangria was refreshing.  Our server was great - water glasses were never empty and he stopped by to check on us frequently.   If this WOB wasn't on the other side of town from me I'd probably frequent more often. If I venture out for some shopping at Galleria Mall I'd definitely stop by to grab a beer!"}
{"text":"I went shortly after opening, with a large group for lunch, and the service was so bad they ended up both swapping who was responsible for us and comping the entire meal. I need to go back to see if it's improved (it would be hard to get worse). It's a good thing none of us had anywhere we needed to be, because service was incredibly slow, and my meal was the last to come out of the 7 we ordered. I'm not sure why, because it was an entree salad. When it arrived, it was missing half the ingredients promised on the menu, including the dressing! At least my group got a good laugh out of the situation.   The one other time I went, for drinks and appetizers during happy hour, the snacks varied from \"ok for bar food\" to \"who thought this was a good idea?\" Sizes were also weird, with two items similarly priced very different in how many people could share them. In short, very inconsistent. I would think a chain would have its processes better standardized and improved from this."}
{"text":"Husband and I have been here a few times.  They have a great selection of beers, and the bartenders have both been very good about answering questions and talking about the beer.  The food is so-so. Nothing to get super excited about.  The place was pretty packed both times.  It gets to feeling a little cramped and uncomfortable when you have people standing over your shoulder the whole time.  The second time we were there the band was so terrible we left after the first beer."}
{"text":"We were out bar hopping on Mill Ave Sunday night because my friend was in town visiting. At 10:30 we came to World of Beer, noting that the hours posted said they were open until 11 we decided to grab one drink there. We started to walk in and were informed by the bartender (before my second foot was through the door) that they were closed. I pointed out that the door said they were open till 11. The response was \"Yeah, but it's dead so...\"  There were a handful of people drinking at the bar, which was the same size crowd we saw everywhere else. But if they don't want our money we'll drink elsewhere. I won't be back."}
{"text":"We ended up at WoB after a full day of business meetings to unwind a bit.  It was a beautiful day and they had the place opened up to the air.  The beer list is long.  If you're into IPA's, they have a bunch.  According to two in our party, several selections were not too tasty.  There were plenty of servers, but they periodically decided everyone was fine and clumped together chatting in a corner.  Twice I had to wave down someone then they dispersed and went back to work.  Everyone enjoyed the food however.  Next time I'm out this way, I'll pass up WoB."}
{"text":"Waited about 15 minutes for someone to tell us our waiter would be with us soon.  There was two waiters the host pointed at us they both look and continued doing what they were doing.  One of them went and help another table who got there after us. Yea not return here again."}
{"text":"I like this place quite a bit. My roommate and I went a couple weeks back when she got back into town after Christmas break. The food was good and their beer selection excellent. I had the gochujang wings and a Belgian flight. She had their chilli and a beer suggested by our server. We both had their s'mores Belgian waffles for dessert. Food came out quickly and our server was super friendly and very helpful with drink selections."}
{"text":"Lots of choices!!! I'm not a drinker but a friend of mine really wanted to try this place out. Our waitress was really helpful and very informative. Very chill place."}
{"text":"Some of the best service I ever received in a restaurant EVER especially at happy hour. I'm a server and I get the ends and outs of a restaurant but I can be a harsh critic but Vinnie was the absolute best! I mean she really was so on it and I def loved her! When I'm in town I will be the first to request her."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!   Not sure about the food...we never received it after waiting 45 minutes.  We finally walked out and went across the street to Slices and grabbed a couple of slices of pizza then off to the ASU game."}
{"text":"We came here for the game and had a blast. Our server was patient and great with our big crowd. It was overwhelming for me to pick out a beer so I just told the server what I was in the mood for and he came back with the perfect selection. We had the mac and cheese, pretzel, wings and we initially wanted the ham and cheese sandwich but they said they were discontinuing that so they subbed in turkey. Pretty standard bar food, not great but not bad at all.   Would definitely go back here for another game as they have tv's everywhere."}
{"text":"Had a great time here. Sat on the patio with no wait at all. Amazing service and food. The tater tots are the best I've ever had. Beer battered fish was good as well. Will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"You may have noticed a common thread in my check-ins and reviews. Between Papago, OHSO and Four Peaks (among others), I am a beer enthusiast.   Which is why I had such high hopes for World of Beer- Tempe.  With over 500 different beers, including 50 taps, I was sure to find myself in hops heaven.  I ventured to WoB on a Friday night at 8:30pm. There wasn't a line outside, but it was crowded. There was nowhere to sit and you couldn't stand anywhere without being in the way. 2 girls who clearly don't understand bar etiquette, were sitting at the bar talking without beverages or trying to order new beverages. Suddenly they were in my way.   I finally got up to the bar and got the attention of Zach, who set me up with a menu and was attentive, knowledgeable and patient. I consider myself a beer connoisseur and I found the menu overwhelming. Zach helped me pick out a Havablue Wheat & Up River Lager from Mudshark Brewery. I was happy with my choice, but my boyfriend wasn't a fan of the lager- different strokes. He prefers skunky European lagers, so it wasn't that it was a bad beer, it just wasn't his style.   I guess it's a good thing he didn't like the beer, because not even 15 min after we arrived and 2 min after I handed him his beer, did a drunk patron slam into the back of him while stumbling through the crowd and spilled his beer all over him.   I didn't even get to try any of the other beers, that killed the night. The patrons of this establishment are the typical Mill Ave college crowd, and frankly seem to be those that wouldn't mind guzzling Coors Light at any other establishment. Don't get me wrong, I am sure the young college crowd is getting schooled in craft beer which is a good thing-- but it definitely will keep those of us already in love with the hard-to-find specialty brews out.  They also don't serve any food, which is an anomaly against most other brewpubs, save for Taste of Tops. You can order in, and with the plethora of options along Mill that's not so bad.   I prefer a place where I can chill with my friends and enjoy great craft beer, where I'm not constantly bumped and pushed, and where I don't have to fight to get service or to get to the bathroom.    I will return, and give WoB another chance- but it won't be at night."}
{"text":"Decent beer selection, but both times we've been here the service has been slow. We walk in and aren't sure if we are supposed to wait or seat ourselves. We gave up and sat, but had to wait for a server to notice us. iPad didn't work right away, but he got us another to look over the beer.  Not into the food selection. Everything I have had has been good, but I have a hard time picking something that sounds good. Most places there are too many good options. Don't know if they have a veggie burger option, but it wasn't advertised if they do.  And their Ladies Night has a hash tag of #girlsdrinkbeer, but the specials are for well drinks and wine. But not beer?  Overall underwhelmed."}
{"text":"Perhaps I was expecting more? They do have a large selection of beer, but I was a strike out on the first two things I wanted (and they listed one of them on the website). Then they brought my boyfriend a porter when he ordered an IPA, which was quickly corrected."}
{"text":"Went with a few co-workers, and they took great care of us all. Wait staff was fast and friendly, and we didn't have to wait long for refills."}
{"text":"Had a great time watching NFL playoffs. The food was excellent and the server was lots of fun!"}
{"text":"I guess the best way to describe this place is to say it is exactly what it is, a bar with beer and beer snacks.  Environment: pretty much a sports bar with some tv screens for games. This spot is pretty much a pretty chill spot to hang out with friends and have some beer. They have live music, but I have not experienced it myself.  Service: there usually aren't too many waitress so the times I have been here, I often had to wait a while to order and pay my check. They are all super friendly, but for some reason, there is always a big of a lag with the low staff. I would say if you are planning on staying here for a while, it would be more fitting, but not for a quick drink or meal.   Food and drinks: I have only had their pretzel here, and I think it is actually very good. The dips for it, cheese beer and mustard are for some reason not that great. I think the mustard was a bit sour and the cheese cooled off too quickly, but the pretzel itself is bomb. The beer option is very vast and you have so many to select from. Their cocktails are good, but the beer is usually why people show up here.  Overall, I think this is a good spot for after work or late night beer and snacks. Things run pretty slowly here, but i can see it being a pretty good spot to catch up with friends and nurse a beer."}
{"text":"Yesterday was a busy night, and my husband and I went to three different restaurants with insane waits before I said, \"Have you heard of that World of Beer place? Let's go check it out!\"   This turned out to be a great decision. We had an amazing experience from top to bottom. The food was delicious. We had the German Pretzel, with beer cheese and stone mustard sauces that were delicious. I had the Steak Fries, cooked perfectly. My husband had amazing, GIANT Korean spiced wings that were spicy and well seasoned. The beer was cold and tasty, with the insane selection they promise you from the second you walk into the door. The cooler special was awesome, so we spent some time in Great Britain for a great price before we moved to some microbrews (the Peanut Butter stout I had was one of the best stouts I ever drank).   But the service was honestly the best part of the night. My husband is in the industry and even though we live in the hospitality capital of the world, we get a lot of lackluster service. That was not the case here. Our server, Taylor, was wonderful from the moment we walked in to the moment we left. She was fun, incredibly knowledgeable, and very attentive. Our glasses were never empty! She helped us navigate the menu and provided great suggestions for both good and drink. Every moment we interacted with her, we were so impressed. Thank you for facilitating a wonderful date night, Taylor!  We're definitely coming back with family because the food is really fantastic and we obviously need to try all the beers, but we're pretty spoiled now. We'll only ever want to sit in Taylor's section!"}
{"text":"This spot has a good range of beers. Their food menu is decent but a little over priced for bar food. The service is a bit slow. Last time I was here they had a very loud and uncomfortable live band. Everyone that came out with us decided to leave and go to another bar because the singers were so obnoxious."}
{"text":"I live nearby and have now been here at least 7 times. Each time is a totally different experience.  Some nights the service is fantastic....and other nights you barely see a waitress.  Sometimes they have the beers you want and sometimes it seems they are out of everything.  I wish they had more of a food selection.  The margarita pizza is great. I went one night and they had a special food menu with sliders. Bring those back please.  When live music plays, it is too small of a place to hear the person sitting next to you. Always packed on the weekends."}
{"text":"Tonight was the VIP opening night for the new location. This location is a little smaller than the Tempe one, as there is no upstairs. There is a nice patio and there is good seating inside. It also has a stage for the live music.   The format is the same - more than 500 beers in the bottle, and this one has 5 more taps than Tempe. The coolers are blacked out and has LED lighting which gives a better look and more visibility. The other location has fluorescent lighting in the coolers. Another plus is this one has a cask cooler so in times like tonight when there was a cask (Sonoran White Chocolate case with Peppermint - very nice), the cask fits in the cooler and customers can see it.   Another big plus for me is the parking. The bar is located in the mall so parking is free and it is plentiful. In Tempe it is difficult and becoming even more challenging to find parking. When parking is there it costs at least $3 per 2 hours.   Having been to the Tempe location from the beginning, I know Gilbert will be very crowded for several months. It is new and the clientele will be different. Unlike when Tempe started this one will already have craft spirits and food (the loaded tater tots are excellent).   I likely will go to both locations. Gilbert is closer to where I live, and the parking at Tempe makes Gilbert a desirable choice."}
{"text":"I have been following World of Beer one Facebook since they first created a page and started planning.  I have been drinking more craft beer and obscure finds recently and the list of available brands was something I was excited for, even though I knew most would be bottles.   I saw Tuesday was going to be a tapping of SanTan Brewing Co Count Hopula and a perfect day to experience the bar for my first time. I liked the location - right on Mill. The beer selection is obviously excellent and I would say among the best in Phoenix. Yardhouse has more on tap, but considering taps & bottles I don't know that anyone surpasses WOB. The building was cool too - an old bank with a brick interior, the bank vault, etc.  They don't serve food, which for me is actually a positive. That means people likely won't be hanging around all night - come in for a couple of drinks and go. I didn't mind the price of the beer. I had the Count Hopula on draught for $5.50. Bottles ranged from $5 to one I saw that was $15, but then again it's not your daddy's ole Natty Light and considering Tilted Kilt is $6 for a draught, it's not bad.   I did end up paying the $15 for a loyalty card. If you plan on going only once or twice it's probably not worth it. If you think you will go frequently to occasionally, why not get it? It's good for 25% off bottles on Tuesday and it is a one-time fee.  Having the card also tracks your drinking habits in the system so you can earn rewards and if you download the handy app for free you can see your progress as well as research new beers to try. Following the Count Hopula I went to bottles to enjoy the 25% off. I started with the Samichalus Helles at 14% alc. I fellow patron who was well informed on beer suggested it and gave me a background story on it. I wouldn't recommend more than one.... A Black Sheep Holy Grail and a Papago Orange Blossom and I called it a night.   The bartenders were plentiful and always busy. Each was very knowledgeable and the guy who told me about the Samichalus told me about their required training. There was only one waitress and she was overwhelmed as they were apparently one waitress short - but I prefer to sit at the bar.  The one negative about everything was the seating. It is a small location. There are several seats at the bar, but those fill up quickly. There are a few long tables, a few small tables in the main area, a back room, and a front room, but again, it was small. Arriving at 4pm on Tuesday I initially was already standing until someone left the bar about 10 minutes later. I can't imagine what it will be like when school is in session, during football games, or any given weekend.  There is an upstairs area, but that is where live music is played. Fortunately for me there was no live music at the time. I like going to concerts and enjoy music, but typically do not like live music when I am going to a bar or restaurant.  Overall everything was positive for me and I will definitely be back...but likely during the late afternoon before the crowds start appearing."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of World of Beer, and sad they have left Arizona. I have been to 13 different locations around the country and was excited on a recent trip to Nevada that I could add this one to my list. It was larger than I expected. The old food standards I used to enjoy - the Pizza Margherita and the Tavern Tots were always my favorite. I ordered both and they were as I expected. The service was okay sitting at the tables. Most of the action was up near the bar. The one distraction was it was very loud in there. A lot of people, which is good, but the noise level was distracting and I couldn't even hear my own tablemates talking. I had one drink and checked out."}
{"text":"Just left El Hefen and came across the street to this place. OMG!! Big difference in the service. The atmosphere is totally different from the bar we just left. The bar staff was awesome and friendly. They made us feel welcomed and gave us great service. Thanks for the great experience and we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Horrible, slow, inattentive service. Much like the other Yelpers described. Ordered margharita flat bread, it came with a 6 inch long hair on it. They tried to tell me it was from the olive oil brush they use. They took it away, brought another one, it was fine. Shocked to find out when we received our bill that they didn't take the flat bread off the bill. Wow, restaurant screw up 101, hair in your food,  you get it for free!  Drink orders took forever! Beer sat on the bar waiting to be served for 5 minutes before I went and got it myself! Server, did not care, neither did the manager! All around, terrible experience, which really sucks because it's has a great atmosphere,  and my husband and I don't get out much, so when we do,  we go to tried and true places. Doubt we'll go back since other Yelpers had the same experience! I may call the manager and ask about the flat bread being left on the bill. I'll update this if I do!"}
{"text":"A whole newwww worrllddddd, with lots of beer to drink... don't you dare close your eyes!  Um. Anyways, World of Beer feels like a strange cross between a real bar and somewhere like the Yardhouse, which with it's cavernous corporate interior doesn't provide the boozy womb like atmosphere that is sort of the point of going to a bar. But WoB, while being partially afflicted with this condition, still feels pretty homey.   Amusingly, they don't sell food but provide menus to a bunch of nearby restaurants who will apparently gladly deliver."}
{"text":"The word awesome pretty much sums up my experience at World of Beer. Let me say that they are not stingy with the sampling and even sent us over a complimentary \"beer shot\",  A+ for making your customer feel appreciated! The bartenders also happen to be extremely attentive and friendly.   They have a plethora of beer here to try and if that is not your thing consider trying one of their delicious ciders (I recommend the raspberry cider-  Crispin with Raspberry lambic)....yum! They have many beers on tap and an enormous by- the- bottle  selection . They even offer to-go services..in beery carryout cartons.  We saw several people participating in a lively tasting so I would definitely consider this for a beer lovers birthday or an after work get together.   Also, they offer free valet and parking in the back.   I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE!!!!!  Bartender made eye contact with me (as I was asking for service) THREE times and chose to ignore me every time!! Instead he ran off to serve people who walked up to the bar (in the same area of about 5 feet of my spot at the bar) after I did and after I made eye contact with that same bartender (I was also waving to ask for service). Absolutely unacceptable!  Good luck getting a drink when the young guy with dark hair is working. It is impossible!!  There were two good bartenders but the AWEFUL batrender prevented me from closing my tab and made me wish I hadn't spent one penny at this bar!!! At least they'll all get to split the mandatory tip that I'm forced to leave since I could not close my tab properly!   I suggest management think very carefully about their hiring choices. I'd have a hard time going back knowing guys like this are hired and in staff here and I have no problem at all telling all my friends why I'd rather not go to this bar given the risk of having to deal with this dreadful bartender who will ignore a customer for no reason whatsoever,"}
{"text":"First time here with my girlfriend.  The menu and pics looked interesting.  We were seated immediately but a server didn't get to us till about 10 min later.  After 10 min, a server walked by and said he will be right with us.  But I think he forgot cause a few minutes later we saw him cleaning tables.  Another server came over which I can tell we weren't in his section and finally helped us.  The food was okay.  We orders the steak flatbread and pretzel. The pretzel was too salty that I was literally scraping the salt off.  The drinks were okay too.  Average experience I guess."}
{"text":"Do you like extremely limited menus, mediocre food, and obnoxious waiters who walk around whistling the whole time you're trying to enjoy your meal (even when you ask them to stop because it's horribly bothersome)? Then this is the place for you!  Seriously though, 0/10 and that waiter should be fired. What a jerk."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times. The food is always great and the beer selection is superb. Normally a pretty busy place, especially on the weekends. The servers always have a smile on their faces, but the owner has been rude to us on more than one occasion. To the point where the servers and hosts (who were all amazing) have had to apologize on his behalf."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to go out for dinner tonight and I wanted a beer because I received some bad news earlier.  We live very close to the Galleria Mall and decided to try the new World of Beer.  Immediately we were greeted by a gentleman that was seating tables.  We chose a booth. Service was awesome. We tried 3 different draught beers. We tried the calamari, mac n cheese and the chili. Loved all of it. Especially the calamari.  We will definitely be back our server Jason was great, very upbeat and lively.  The gentleman who seated us checked on us regularly too.  They were out of one of the beers we chose but we were given a suggestion of the replacement and loved it. Our first impression was really great. Good atmosphere along with a creative concept."}
{"text":"Stopped here during my trip yesterday with my boyfriend. We've been to other locations before but this one was my favorite. Great beer selection, knowledgeable and super friendly staff that night. I believe the girls at the bar were Lauren and Sarah, and they were awesome and insanely friendly. They gave some good recommendations and We ordered tavern tots and they were delish! Shrimp tacos were good too. Overall very pleased with our experience  food, drink, and bartenders were all on point!"}
{"text":"This is the place to go if you're a beer connoisseur. Matt was our bartender and was was friendly, helpful and very knowledgeable of all the wide array of Ales/Lagers/Pilsners, etc. that this amazing place has to offer. He offered us samples of any beer we wanted to try and had an elaborate description for each one. The choices are endless!!! And the vibe was amazing. We will DEFINITELY be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection and very nice patio to sit outside and relax with friends. The servers were friendly but had to run our bill 3 times and we still got charged incorrectly. Might be back to try the food...the sangria was delicious and we liked the atmosphere. Tuesday night is trivia night!"}
{"text":"Beer selection is outstanding and would give the choices 5 stars, but unfortunately for the good beer choices you have to be ok with sub par service.    The different styles of beer they have to choose from is impressive. They have something for everyone from the novice beer drinker to the beer aficionado!! As far as beer temps. I did notice some Beers are colder than other, but it wasn't something that bothered me to much as it wasn't that big of a deal.   As for the service, let's just say they do the bare minimum. No one was rude, but they weren't friendly either.  For me if a place is known for hundreds of beer choices I would think the staff would be excited about promoting them and getting patrons to try new things, but NOPE not here.  Didn't feel very welcoming.  Just gave off a \"meh\" vibe.   I'll stop by again for a quick beer \"if\" I'm in the area, but won't be a frequent visitor."}
{"text":"Great variety of beers, awesome service.  Happy hour prices are amazing. The pretzels with the beer cheese are the bomb. Will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"The place is awful.  The service is incredibly slow.  It took over an hour to get appetizers. It was ridiculous.  I don't recommend..."}
{"text":"Tryed coming here a second time and should have know better. Dirty surrounding poor service. Poor menu selection. Won't be returning ever again. Love the look of the place. Nice patio. But bad service  will keep me away. Sucks to it could be a nice place."}
{"text":"This place was rad the first time we went, waitress was on it (also training at the same time) food was on point. But this time, no so much. Either the kitchen forgot to fire out app or server forgot to put it in. Ordered a shot, then 10 minutes later told the server we didn't get it, Then he came back and told us they didn't have it. Also told us he was gonna bring waters and didn't. (at this point I'm not thirsty any more) We ordered a burger and a chicken sandwich, burger was like a hockey puck and tots were cold. Probably will sit at the bar next time and just drink beer or not."}
{"text":"Stopped in with a good friend because we both hadn't been... I am not a huge beer drinker at all so I was kinda iffy on even visiting the place but I always like to try new things and of course, Yelp about it haha  We walked in and noticed there is a loft that you could sit in, so we did that and it was pretty cool! Great view of everyone so we could people watch...  Our server was absolutely wonderful. He informed us of all the beer we could choose from and he said that we could sample any beer that we would like. I like more fruity beers, I don't know what the name of that would even be... I'll just call it fruit beer or fruit ale...  I sampled at least 4 different beers and I ended up going with a raspberry one which I did enjoy...  My friend got a chocolate milk stout which I thought in my head--- Gross  But then I tried it and I did like it! I really liked it... And she was in heaven! It was her new favorite stout... I still don't know what stout means but I'm guessing it has to do with DARK...   All in all the World of Beer was a chill spot to catch a beer with new friends, good friends, or even alone...  ****this is an update...  I went in and wasn't feeling beer at the moment so I asked for a marg and the cute bartender ( forgot his name) made one of the best margs I have ever had and I gave him a hard time because it was a beer place... He was so nice and I will for sure go back for beer or margs or anything"}
{"text":"I will never come back here. My friend and I both ordered the same burger and mine had jalapenos on it and my friend's did not. The fries were soggy, they delivered the wrong wings and the service was SO SLOW! I don't know if it is always like this or this time was a fluke, but I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Such a great experience. I found out about this place while shopping at the Galleria. There isn't much advertisement for this place so I did not know when this place actually opened. A friend invited me to check it out on a Wednesday night and I was quite impressed.   World of Beer has a great location. In the Galleria next door to Gen Korean BBQ, it was quite easy to find and there was plenty of parking located right in front of the place. My party of 3 arrived at 8pm. The host greeted us immediately and we were able to sit at a table that we picked. There were only 4 other tables and a few people sitting at the bar. There is a nice patio but it was a bit chilly so we decided to sit at a booth inside.   Our server Andrew M. was nothing short of excellent. We asked him for food and drink recommendations and were glad that we listened to him because the choices were awesome. We ordered a pretzel (be warned, it's huge and good for about 3 people). The pretzel came with a side of cheese and Dijon mustard. It was perfectly buttered and filling! We also ordered wings, half spicy Korean and half garlic Parmesan. As warned by Andrew, the Korean wings were a bit spicy but super tasty! We enjoyed both flavors but loved the Korean wings because we love Spicy! We also listened to Andrew and got the Shrimp Tacos with Aioli sauce and Barbacao Tacos. I was really happy about our order but even more satisfied due to the amazing service Andrew provided us with.  Andrew talked about how the place just opened and what to expect in the coming weeks like brunch with Bottomless Beer, Beermosas, Mimosas and Bloody Mary's. That sounds like such an amazing thing especially during football! (Did I mention they have tons of flatscreen tvs to show games). I moved to Las Vegas from Los Angeles and what this city needs are more brunch places with bottomless brunch that is a good place to watch sports! Andrew was also knowledgeable about all the different beers that they carried (soo many beers, it's amazing). He also offered to bring board games to the table which was really nice. The had games like \"never have u ever\" and Jenga. Which is such a good idea!! Especially waiting for food! And then again to play after a few drinks!  Because of the experience our server Andrew provided us with I give this restaurant 5 stars! We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"World of Beer is as accurate a name as any.  They have a lot.  And a lot on tap, too.  The prices are par for the course and the bartenders and serves do a great job of making sure no one is standing there with an empty glass waiting on help.  I appreciate the support they give the local breweries, featuring a lot of Charlotte microbrews and under-the-radar seasonals and special releases. They do not have a kitchen and get around the \"must provide foods\" laws by providing menus for places that will provide prompt delivery service.  Very clever.  All that said, it's a corporate joint and all that entails, both good and bad. You know what to expect and it's going to be relatively consistent. On the other hand, it lacks the time-weathered warmth of a local establishment and the mood can feel forced (Of course, I feel like most of Southend has that feel, but that's a different discussion).  All in all, it's a great new place with a lot of beers to choose from and it's a great fit for the Southend area that you should stop into and check out."}
{"text":"Most of the beer starts around $5 range.  My wife and I each picked a beer.  Hers was around $5.50 with alcohol content around 4.5 I saw one that had a content of 10.5 and thought \"wow twice the alcohol for only 2 more dollars. . Great deal\". She got her beer in a straight pint sized glass and I received mine in a brandy glass that held about half the content of hers. Sad very sad."}
{"text":"Tried WoB last Friday for the first time. We were with a large group but had no problem putting tables together to accommodate. The yard games and couches are a nice little bonus for groups, and during the summer I'll look forward to the garage door being open. I love the size and the decor, and the beer selection alone is worth the visit.  Zoe, our server, was wonderful. She was incredibly attentive to everyone's drink levels and overall very enjoyable to talk to.  The music was fun live and not, but the live does get loud if you're sitting near the stage.  The beer list was diverse with local and international options and everything in between. The food menu impressed me as I wasn't expecting so many options. The appetizers were delish, and the pretzel fantastic.  Overall it was very enjoyable. I was impressed and will be back soon."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time to watch an OSU game. I grabbed a seat at the bar and had to wait just under 15 minutes to finally have a bartender greet me. The biggest problem I had with that was they weren't even busy, and two of the bartenders looked me straight in the eye several times and still didn't say anything. When I was finally greeted, the bartender was nice, and when I asked for the food menu, he explained a new concept to me--BYOF. Bring your own food. They don't have a kitchen, but you can order from a few local places---I only remember seeing Jimmy Johns, Donatos, but there were a few others. Or, you have the option of bringing over whatever food you want. Since I wasn't in the mood for a sub or pizza, we actually ended up just walking out and going down the street to another restaurant.  I might possibly check this place out again if I am only going to be drinking and not going there for food. They do have a huge beer selection, there's no denying that. When I was there is a cold out, so the patio doors were shut. With the place closed up, the smell of beer was overwhelming, and def. not in a good way. I was actually glad we left, because I'm not sure if I would have been able to last very long in there. The smells of different types of beer mixed together...yuck."}
{"text":"Slow service. Staff seemed confused and wondering why we were there. Everytime the server passed us it would jog his memory. Eventually we got our beer. Half the \"selection\" was out of stock. Ambiance was pretty good. Not impressed."}
{"text":"great selection of different beers from all over the world and local ones too. our server, Jeremiah, was attentive and informative and provided great customer service. went with the wings dry rub and garlic parmesan and the flavor was excellent."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere but service was a bit slow.  Bartenders were knowledgeable about beers.  One big downside was no food"}
{"text":"The beer selection is unbelievable. There is too many to count, unless you really like to count. Then, this is the place for you. We met some friends for a game, and they had no issue in seating the 10-12 of us. We grabbed some tall tables and all ordered a selection of beers to sample. It's a bit weird to think that this place is in a strip mall. It was a bit smaller than I thought it was going to be also. The servers were super fast in getting our orders, even though it was pretty busy for the Badger game. We had a couple of food orders at out table and the food seemed like average pub food. If you are unsure of where to start on the extensive beer list, ask your server or bartender. They will be able to whittle down the list for you. They also offer pre-selected samplers on the menu too."}
{"text":"First visit. Had the bibimbap and it was really done well and was tasty. Didn't have been so cannot comment on that but they have a large selection. Wife had a big juicy burger which she enjoyed.  Service was good and they weren't packed so they didn't mind us hanging out.  Standard chain store environment but was impressed with the menu"}
{"text":"Been coming here for a good minute and let me tell you, the service never seems to fail. Beer selection and food is always on point. Also, if you want fast and friendly service, Jason is your man. Will definitely be back next week. As always!"}
{"text":"Its funny reading the comments on service.   Why would you let 1 time bad service make you give a place like this a 1 star??   The beer choices are excellent here!  I found a new type of beer I really enjoy,  I got the shrimp tacos which were amazing and got to watch football.   What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"My last review was almost a year ago, since then there has been a complete turn around. Awesome job in the kitchen!!!! The food has been phenomenal  for such a small kitchen.  Bar manager and waitstaff, to be blount, Lindsey, Tessa and Mary have invested heart and soul into turning this WOB into a standout. This is our go to place."}
{"text":"As expected an awesome selection of beer. The bartender was awesome she was very attentive. Food was so so at best but if your looking for a place to find good beer you can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"I guess I must be Chuck E Cheese.  There are kids running around, have a fort built on the stage, screaming, sitting at empty tables, snapping the rubber bands on the menu.  I guess I expected more from a place that has beer in the name.  I'd never come back to a place like this.  Why is everything so \"family friendly\" ie. \"Bring your screaming kid, don't watch them, no one cares\"."}
{"text":"More like \"World of Clusterfuck\", am I right?  Okay, we can all agree the concept owns. Countless bottles, all organized by nation are stacked in a row of refrigerators. Like someone bought the beer aisle at BevMo! and said \"let's open our own bar with this!\". You will marvel at the overwhelming selection.  And you will wait.  Because when you come here, you'll agree with me that the execution is a real fail. Look, I'm used to being patient about getting a brew. It's right on Mill Ave, of course it's going to be busy and of course It'll be a chore to get some service. Except the layout blows. Absolutely sucks, there's some seating off to the side, and one large, narrow hall through the center. It was actually very difficult navigating this enormous crowd, and near impossible to position myself in front of the actual taps (middle of the room), from where the bartenders exclusively collected orders. After much struggling, I was rewarded with a cold one...not that you can enjoy it   All I find myself asking is \"why this location\"? Your prime demographic just vaguely knows craft beer as Blue Moon and Kiltlifter, and they just wanna shotgun some Miller Lite while they check out some ass. This place is 5 stars for product, but 1 star for execution. I'll be back again, but ONLY during the day."}
{"text":"My buddies and I decided to stop in to grab some beers to escape the heat.  What we didn't realize was the place didn't open for another hour.  The bartender however was quite gracious and was happy to serve us poor sweaty saps.    I opted for several of the local brews (Ninkkasi, dark and malty) and they definitely hit the spot.  The variety is great (see the pictures) and there are loads of beers on tap and available.  If you want to take a peek before venturing in, the menu is quite extensive: http://worldofbeer.com/locations/Tempe/menus  Since the place wasn't officially open, the bartender stood by and chatted.  Very cool girl, I don't recall her name but she was from California and she was very knowledgeable about the beers and the things to do in the area (and randomly, San Diego (lol)).  The ambiance was a typical bar getup and there were TVs with sports.  Very chill.  -----------------------------  For the beer-illiterates like myself: When choosing a beer, the bitterness level is measured by IBU.  IBU usually ranges from 0 (watery) to 120 (cough syrup/medicine (IMO)).  Beers are categorized in Malts (dark with usually hints of caramel, coffee, nuts, etc), Stouts (barley), Porters (dark and dry), Ales (full bodied with hints of fruit/spice), and Lagers (aged, very carbinated with a medium hops taste). ----------------------------  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Nice place to hang out with friends/family and have a beer. I like how the windows are fully opened and you can see the view from inside. Nice bartender and the price on the beers are affordable!   I rated it 3 stars because I ordered a blueberry beer and was expecting it to have a hint of blueberry taste to it. It had the ale aftertaste which is still good and few frozen blueberries in it."}
{"text":"Yes, I am a big fan!  My taste for beer has grown exponentially over the years and with World of Beer moving into the hood I can expand my taste some more. It isn't in the most convenient location for me, but it's in a good spot for the town. I work in Tempe so this will be a happy hour spot for me.   When we first walked in I totally understood what everyone else meant by it's too small. Kind of narrow and full of people can be a little daunting. However we totally lucked out and got two prime seats up at he bar right as a couple of guys were leaving. And when I say they were packed it was slammed, took nearly 15 minutes to get a drink and we were staring the bar tenders in the face. There were many factors playing into this so I wont hold it against them for too long, it was happy hour, they are new, probably still training most of the staff and just a lot going on. They will really need to get a better handle on he crowd, because 15 min for a beer, not going to fly with most people. Suggestions: Don't have 15 people behind the bar, it was obvious that it was hard for you all to navigate around each other. Maybe assign stations, like each bartender gets 6 ft of bar space they are responsible for so they aren't all running around all over the place. Don't be affraid to look at people in the face, we were ignored for so long because I think they were afraid to look up it was so busy. Eye contact is a great way to keep up on customer service, you will know immediatly if someone needs something.    One thing really turned the service around for me though, it was a Thursday and I read that it was Ladies Night (1/2 off select draft beers), but I wasn't sure what beers that entailed. I asked the bartender which ones were included, half expecting him to give me a half assed answer, rightfully so though, they were crazy busy and a customer asking for details would surely irritate anyone, but no. This bartender, wish I got his name, took the time to point out the ones that I could get for 1/2 price and started to explain them to me. So nice! I stopped him early tho so as to not waist his time anymore, and ordered one I saw that was on special I already wanted.   They have great TVs for sports watching, the bathrooms are very nice big and clean, and the patio area is very cute. They should think about putting a few bar tables out there, no chairs just tables, so that people have something to set their drinks on while they are outside.   I will defiantly be back, I have a lot of work to do if I want to get some good rewards point ;-)"}
{"text":"BEER? CHECK. WINGS? CHECK. What more can you ask for? Oh, I know, how about a little corn hole after your meal out on the patio?!!  What a great night. First time. 500 plus beers? Ok!! Lots on tap with tons in bottles and cans. If you can't find it here it may not exist. Having said that I was looking for the iconic Iron Maiden Trooper beer but they surprisingly didn't have it. No big deal. Lots of other options. I was just hoping to find it here.   Wings were solid. Being from Buffalo, I could prob teach them how to make a better sauce but all things being even, pretty good.   Then we took our beers on the patio and threw bean bags for an hour and a half. So much fun! Only downside was smokers coming out and ruining the air on the patio but otherwise, a great place with a fun atmosphere. Def be back soon!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on 11/14 to have a beer while out shopping. It was about 3:30 PM in the afternoon.  It happened to be my birthday & so they treated me to my first beer. Had a blonde bock beer recommended by our sweet waitress. It was really light and refreshing! Our server was wonderful & attentive, great personality! She also suggested the nacho tater tots, they were dangerous delish! Cheesy goodness smoothed on top of these tatters is made with their own ale beer! Also had the golden ale shrimp appetizer it was lightly battered & topped with a lime aioli sauce! Suggest you try out both! We were able to \"sample\" a few other brews & look forward to returning. Can't wait to try other beers along with their suggested pairings of food.  Fun atmosphere, cool place- check it out for yourselves!"}
{"text":"Their food is good my family and I recently were here and the portion size was right in fir the price I can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"I have been going to WOB for a few months now. I might even consider myself a regular there at this point.  What hooked me about WOB is the extensive beer knowledge that the servers and bartenders have.  There are lots of places in Tempe with good beer, but very few places where the staff know beer as well as they do at WOB.  By the second time going there, the bartender remembered me and recommended excellent beers according to my tastes.  Rachel, the bartender with the purple hair, particularly stands out in her level of beer knowledge and exceptional customer service.  Every time I go there she takes time to make sure that I'm taken care of and even if I'm not in her section she always comes by to make sure I'm doing ok and to recommend beer to me she believes I'll enjoy based on her memory of my beer preferences.  Brandon and Hannah are two more WOB staff who stand out in their exceptional customer service and beer knowledge.  The beer selection at WOB is truly impressive and ever changing, which makes going there once a week a true beer adventure!  I especially enjoy the tap events sponsored by local breweries during which I can taste beers that are available no where else.  The addition of food to their wares is very welcome.  The food is delicious, presented very well, and is served very quickly.  And, for you vegetarian beer drinkers out there, their vegetarian flatbread is divine!"}
{"text":"Came here for a beer tasting event and felt the venue was subpar.  This is more of a review for the beer-tasting, rather than the bar itself - the bar has always been pretty damn good.  You would think that WOB is a good place for a beer-tasting event given their name, but it just didn't cut it - I'd rather go somewhere else.  At the very least, if WOB is going to promote beer-tasting events, I highly recommend that they get a server or whoever that's really into beer.  Compared to the other places I've been for beer-tasting, we didn't get any enthusiasm or explanations from the service staff.  To me, that really detracts from the whole experience.  Instead of engaging in beer snobbery, we were subject to beer flights that came out whenever someone ordered a flight.  We were handed a piece of paper telling us what the beer was, but nothing more.  It was the equivalent of ordering four beers and just drinking them.  Didn't feel like a beer-tasting at all.  *Maybe a nice touch would be selecting beers that aren't so standard at the Charlotte bars given their wide array of beer selections*  I couldn't give this place less than 3 stars though.  Bradley was born here (inside joke) so it will always be special.    I'll be back here ... but not for beer-tasting.  dmo out."}
{"text":"Happy Valentines Day? What a beautiful snowy Sunday; for brunch?  We decided to try The (\"Beer-unch\") WOB's beer based brunch every Sunday from 11-3pm) at around 12:00pm.   We sat ourselves and a waiter brought us menus and a beer list for the taps.   There were two \"infused brews\"  on the menu, one of which was described as a \"coffee stout infused with coffee and cherry\" which somehow sounded Valentine-like so I was curious; the description also read 0.0% ABV...when I asked for more info on this infused brew, waiter deterred me from ordering this and said there were typos on the menu and I'd probably not like it; how he came to this conclusion I'll never know and this was very disappointing, as the WOB website states the staff is well informed of all their products and would love to talk brew. There's an impressive dual cooler with bottles and cans of brews from all over the world.  I decided on a Samuel Smith Organic Chocolate Stout (it was Valentines Day so an obvious choice I thought ) the scent alone had me floating....and my BF had the \"Founder's Dark Penance IPA.           About ten minutes after our arrival, around 15 kids under age 10 and about ten adults came in, as well as a few other couples.  There were only two guys working the entire joint. uh oh... We quickly ordered from the regular menu; a regular cheeseburger and pub fries for me and the roasted chicken pesto club with same fries for my valentine and a 'lil sweet n' spicy for the table; five buffalo wings and five spicy honey wings too.  Forty five minutes later, the wings arrived at the same time as the sammies and fries.  Food was cold, wings were the worst I've ever had; gigantic, completely flavorless and tough.   (2in 30 days kind) and we only had one napkin each...and no little hand wipes like you usually get with wings.  My burger was rare inside and was a rediserve type of patty with a pale grainy tomato and a sad little lettuce leaf on a stale brioche bun. both of us had cold pale soggy fries, and my BF's chicken pesto was flavorless as well.  Also none of the food had any odor..i mean you couldn't smell food at all.  The last straw was when we hadn't seen our waiter in almost an hour, and my BF had to go to the bar to get us some waters.   Lucky for WOB it was Valentine's Day because we were lost in our own conversation and each other which made waiting easier.  The acoustics are more for a loud Saturday night of music...not for conversing. The tables were sticky and the windows greasy. The bathrooms were very clean however, the faucet was not working and there were six cute little girls giggling about dropping one of their phones in the toilet....and no way to wash their hands after retrieving it.   \"Check please...\"   Or not.... We had to wait another twenty minutes for our bill of $49.16  This was a bad choice for brunch; clearly a beer bar who should maybe not serve any food except popcorn or salty peanuts to encourage more beer sales.  The selection of beer was impressive indeed but staff was lacking in expertise and genuine interest ....at least this snowy Valentine's Day in 2016?"}
{"text":"There is nothing exciting about a stale corporate version of Taste of Tops. They have the same beers and are much more expensive than Taste of Tops. Guess the rent on Mill Ave is a lot more than on University a couple of blocks away.  Loud and horrendously bad music doesn't help either.  No food but you can call the local restaurants for delivery, but this is a problem because when the delivery people get there they have no idea on who ordered the food and you can't hear your phone ring so the delivery people just wander around aimlessly.. Also you have Mill Ave parking issues to deal with. They do have a lot of beers to choose from but so does Tops down the street.  My advice, save your wallet and your ears and go to Tops down the street instead."}
{"text":"I love beer. I mean, who doesn't? There's a beer for everyone and that's what WOB is. Its a place for anyone who can find a beer they will love. I personally love hanging out in this place instead of going to a crowded club in the vicinity. I love the atmosphere and the employees are always so nice and talkative. They answer any questions and recommend a ton of new and interesting options available. You cannot go wrong with World of Beer!"}
{"text":"WOB is a pretty cool place. I live really close by so for convenience purposes, it's a great place to kick back and have a few beers. The beer selection, as expected is outstanding and the staff is really friendly. I have just recently started expanding my beer pallet so I'm always looking for recommendations and suggestions on different beers, and the staff is usually able to point me in the right direction.   The prices are a little high for a beer (generally about 5-6 bucks a piece) so I try not to come here too often and the fact that they don't have any food is a little disappointing but I guess if you're a beer lover, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"World Of Beer!  The name says it all, plenty of great choices and the food is good to boot.   They use Cali Creamin and infuse it with fruits/dates/spices for a new concoction daily which is smooth and flavorful and on your first visit you can get a free local beer (although I hear this promotion will end soon)   Chicken wings are flavorful, tator tots great, and the German Pretzel is a monster of an appetizer lol.  Wasn't too impressed with Calamari but hey they can't all be winners right.   My favorite meal was the Hangover skillet everything you need/want in a breakfast including BACON!!   Overall service is ok sometimes underwhelming but the selection of beers, location and food will bring me back."}
{"text":"NO CHILLED GLASSES!  WTF IS WRONG WITH YOU?  We drove over here because we love our craft-beer.  We asked for a chilled glass and were told they don't serve chilled glasses.  My date and I turned around and left.  Seriously?  You call yourselves \"World of Beer\" and don't have chilled glasses?   UPDATE (response to response) Wolfgang.  I don't need it \"explained\" to me; get over your snobby self. There is no \"confusion\" on my part. Like many, many people, we like our craft-beer cold and in chilled glasses. If you don't want to offer it as an option, that is your choice; but you will lose our business.  We like our beer that way and don't need to be patronizingly educated about it as you seem to think."}
{"text":"World of Beer is a great place - band that was here today -ZANCUDO was AWESOME."}
{"text":"Pretty good selection of beer- wish the food selection was bigger/better.   Please DEAR GOD change the music. It's awful. Enough to leave. It's like the worst of the 90s music compilation.   No more Prince at a bar! Ever."}
{"text":"Beer! There is not much else to say! The Beer selection here at WOB is awesome with over 50 rotating taps and 10 beer frigs shelving hundreds of bottles even some 22oz selections! WOB has domestic as well as regions all over the world with all different price points and types. When it comes to the tap they keep it seasonal and try to get limited batches that other bars may not have! I think I found my new spot for winding down after work!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night wanting to go to gen. The wait was ridiculous so we just ended up eating here since we were grabbing beers here already. We were about the only big party. We all ordered drinks and food. Maybe the waiter was new but there was a lot of confusion. First of all our drinks took a long time to come. Granted we were 12 people, but 20 minutes seem long.   After our drinks came, food took another 20 minutes to come. The place was not too packed, there were a bunch of empty tables, and we were the only big party there!  The food itself was pretty decent. I got the chicken sandwich and it was really good. Came with a side of crispy tator tots. I also tried the wedge salad and the margarita flatbread. The flatbread with really good. Loved the basil and the pesto sauce. Wedge salad is a wedge salad.   When the bill came, they gave us separate checks, which is awesome!  However, there was a lot of confusion because we were charged drinks that we either never ordered or never got. Some stuff got billed into other party's checks.   Food here is pretty good. The waiters we're really nice as well but food just took a long time to come and the bills should have been more organized."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Just stopped by to check it out and catch the Sunday night game. Was surprised with live acoustic guitar. Beer selection is great. Service was exceptional. Coming back when I'm hungry!!  Try the Asian wings. My fave."}
{"text":"Steven was cute. beer selection was great. food was tasty. will come here again when i'm in AZ! :)"}
{"text":"Great beer selection (obviously) and knowledgeable staff. Enjoyed the beer sampler and the descriptive menu with it that gave you a little background on each beer. Drank a beer brewed with Sheep Dung and it was great!"}
{"text":"Beer was fantastic and so was the good. Had a burger and it was big and juicy. Service was great. Our waitress was friendly and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"great place, beer was awesome and service was great! And dog friendly! we were in from out of state and had the puppies with us and wanted good food and drink and got both! Super friendly wait staff! would highly recommend and we will go back!"}
{"text":"I like what they are trying to do. The bottle selection is the only draw for me. Most beers here you can basically get at a dozen other places in town. I am a big fan of that big pretzel. I've been to one in Denver and that had a way better vibe and beer list. I will go there again so it's not off my radar yet."}
{"text":"If you are a beer lover, this is like Disneyland, minus the lines and crying children! 54 rotating taps, with lots of locals, and 500 bottles. And if you're feeling overwhelmed, they have an awesome app you can download that helps you sort through the beers by color, alcohol %, and style. There's also  tons of TVs making it a great place to watch a game and have a beer or two (or five). If you spend $15 to get a loyalty card, you earn points towards discounts/prizes for each beer you drink.  They don't serve food, but they partnered with a handful of nearby restaurants who will deliver your food to WOB for no extra charge. I can't remember all of the restaurants, but I know Jimmy John's, Robbie Foxes, and Fuzzy's Tacos were on the list.   The only negatives is I wish it was bigger. On a Friday or Saturday night, I feel like it is going to be obnoxiously crowded, but I am one who likes to be able to sit down at a bar, so take that with a grain of salt. They did say they are planning on opening up the upstairs area and getting some patio seating, so that might help. It looks like they will be able to open the windows up when the weather is nice, which will be perfect for Sunday Fundays.   Bottom line- if you are a beer lover, come give praise at your new mecca."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. They had amazing drafts, really friendly staff and a live 2 person set. I found my non dive bar I would like to go to from now on."}
{"text":"We've come to this location twice now. The first time was my boyfriends birthday. We had 8 young adults drinking an insane amount of alcohol and the place was empty. Don't you think a server would pay special attention to a table like this? She did not. It was like pulling teeth ordering a beverage or more food. A few of us went to the bar to order drinks. We ended up winning the trivia game and won a $25 gift card. So, we have returned to try it again with our gift card. The service, yet again was not great. We walked in and were not sure where to sit. Nobody was there to direct us or anything. We sat at a table in the bar area and were greeted after having been sat for at least 5 minutes. Upon getting our appetizer my boyfriend ordered a drink, the server forgot it and we ended up getting the beer at least 15 minutes later. I also ordered the pesto chicken sandwich, I really did not like it, but was going to eat it. The server asked if I liked it and I was honest and told him I did not. He took it and said he would take care of it, which I thought was nice, but when we got our check there was only $3 comped off of it. That's fine, but if you were only going to comp $3, why didn't you let me finish it or take it home? If you took it from me you should have comped the meal.   To top it all off we had a $25 gift card and the server explained to us that the computer system would not allow him to charge the full $25 because it leaves room to \"allow for a tip\". What if I did not want to leave a tip? (Of course we did) this doesn't seem okay to me. Probably will not be returning again."}
{"text":"Excellent micro beer selection. They carry Alpine beer, which is phenomenal beer from outside San Diego. Food was good. I had the pork schnitzel and my wife had the salmon. Both worth getting again. It's a good place to go if you want good food with excellent beer selection. Service was great."}
{"text":"So we've been there a few times now.  They were pretty cool the first day.  Then we went back for the grand opening.  They were ok.  Then the 3rd time we wen't seems like they don't seem to eger to serve you.  We had to flag someone down.  They were at the end of the bar chit chattin.  I like the bar and all the beer.  But my other problem is that they already started changing out there taps.   So as soon as you see one you like, it might be gone next time.   There are a couple of employees there that I like, but they usually work the tables, and we prefer to sit at the bar.....Maybe we need to go to a table.  We will see."}
{"text":"Great selection of beer! It's too bad that the staff brings this place down so much. Although we were seated right away, it was followed by some piss poor service from Karolina. When you can't get a simple glass of water, maybe you shouldn't be in the service industry. The place wasn't packed. There wasn't a whole lot going on. But yet we were treated like we weren't welcome. I would rather head to the store buy some craft beer and order take out than come back here."}
{"text":"I agree with the two other reviews above. I ordered 3 Giness drafts and my bill was $21.. $7 a beer is outrageous! I live across the street and I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I feel like if I had any other server my first experience here would not have been so awful. I came in with my boyfriend and his friend and we stood at the front for a while not sure if it was the \"seat yourself\" type of place or if a host was suppose to seat you. So after standing up there for a long time without being helped we figured we could just walk in and sit down wherever. We walked over to the only open booth at the time and it was dirty so we just stood in front of it waiting to be helped. Finally someone saw us and cleaned it off for us and brought us some menus. After 15 minutes of sitting there and not being helped our server, Andrew, finally came over to take our drink order. Then it took him such a long time to bring us three waters. Finally after waiting a total of 20-30 minutes JUST for waters, he took our beer/food orders. I decided to get the Belgian s'mores waffle since I recently ate. I wanted to get a vodka cranberry but I knew it wouldn't go well with the waffle and asked him what to do. Instead of suggesting drinks that I might like with the waffle, his response was \"Yeah, the vodka cranberry wouldn't go well with that waffle.\" So I ordered the waffle and was looking through the beer list while waiting for it to come. The waffle arrived at a decent time and I was surprise to find out it wasn't even a full waffle. They were four tiny bite-sized pieces. With no help from Andrew, I found the double chocolate stout beer and I really wanted that with my dessert. My only problem was that Andrew already dropped off the waffle and DID NOT come back to the table after that for a very long time. I could not wait any longer so I decided to eat it with only water. After 30 long minutes without being checked on and finishing my four bite-sized waffle pieces (which was absolutely delicious, it's the only reason this review gets two stars instead of one), he finally came back. I asked him for a refill of water since I was without water for most of my meal and for the double chocolate stout beer. Once I ordered that beer he had the AUDACITY to tell me \"That would have been good with the waffle.\" Are you kidding me? I WAS TRYING TO ORDER THAT WITH MY WAFFLE BUT YOU NEVER CAME BACK TO CHECK ON US. AND I EVEN ASKED FOR HIS OPINION FROM THE BEGINNING BUT ALL HE SAID WAS THAT VODKA CRANBERRY WAS \"NOT A GOOD MATCH.\" So I angrily responded \"Oh I know.\" Then it took him 15 minutes to bring us the chocolate stout (it could've been the bartender's fault, but at this point, I doubt it). Finally it comes, along with another beer for my boyfriend's friend. My boyfriend wanted to make another beer order but he never came back after dropping off the chocolate stout. At this point we had been there for AN HOUR AND A HALF and did not even order that much. We look around the restaurant and find him flirting with some girls at another table. Once he was finally done doing that we asked him for the check (WHICH TOOK HIM A GOOD 10 MINUTES, WHY?!???) He put it all on one check so we asked for it to be split and he split it almost immediately and brought it back (fastest thing he did all night). We left our cards at the edge of the table for another 10 minutes until he finally came by to take them. My boyfriend's friend stiffed him and my boyfriend tipped him $1. We ALWAYS tip 20% for decent-good service. We all work in the food industry so we know how it can be sometimes but this was absolutely AWFUL AND SLOW service. We were finally able to leave after TWO HOURS. We saw that his main priority was clearly to flirt with the women at the other table. I will give this place another try sometime in the future, and when I do I'll make sure Andrew isn't my server."}
{"text":"So, I was pretty excited to hear of a new craft beer bar opening up in Gilbert, since there's not much to do out there. They have a pretty good selection of craft beers available. I don't see me coming back though. While the beers were good, the service is pretty awful.   You have to start a \"tab\" and give them your credit card when you sit down at the bar, even though it's dead in there and maybe there's three other customers at the bar. They still somehow manage to ask how you want to split your tab w/ your friend at the end and, who ordered what again??. What's the point of starting a tab if nothing is kept track of?  Also, servers don't seem very knowledgeable about the beers. The bartender briefly scanned the bottled beers and said they didn't have what I ordered. I found it a minute later while scanning the tap handles.  The food is very basic, appetizers mostly and they're all extremely overpriced. A scotch egg, which is a really simple, usually cheap dish at most bars somehow costs $7. A pretzel was $8. The beer however, was priced pretty well for the most part.  And oh yea, the music is awful. A mixture of Nickleback, Creed and other brorock ballads to go along with the pro-wrestling playing on the TV...really great atmosphere they've created.  Don't see me coming back, but maybe these things will get worked out eventually."}
{"text":"For this beer enthusiast, on Tempe's Mill Avenue, my eyes fixed longingly on the 100 year old bank building with the origional vault and a beer garden housing 100's of great brews from around the world.  The WOB staff is super friendly and have to say, I just love holiday cheer. One of my favorite tap houses in Tempe."}
{"text":"Get a beer shot from Austin!!! So darn good.   Came in with the family after a long day of moving. The staff was friendly and attentive. Gave us some great beer suggestions. The food was great bar food and came out Hot.   Austin was out waiter and has waited on my parents multiple times. Never disappointed."}
{"text":"Good food and the outdoor patio seating had lit fire pits and was warm and comfortable. Staff was friendly, but our waitress could not tell us anything about any of the beers and had a hard time recommending ones to us. The food was a little pricey in my opinion. For 2 people, we ordered a burger, taco meal, 2 drinks and 2 shots and out bill was ~$80. I'll have try again when it's happy hour!"}
{"text":"Nice place to spot for your not so typical beer. Its in the mall area so we dont love that aspect but a good meet up place for my friends that live most east of the downtown gilbert area. Great selection of beers those and also have fun seasonals to try. If you are a big beer connoisseur this is probably where you will find the best variety in the south/east valley."}
{"text":"Beer Paradise!  Bullet point review:  - Largest selection in Vegas (nearly 600 in bottle / 40 on tap, ever rotating with great selection of Nevada craft brews).  - Cool vibe without being craft beer pretentious.  No man bun bartenders who scoff at your lack of knowledge.  Sit at the bar if you want to learn about the beer you're drinking, else rely on the excellent descriptions on their mobile app.  - Full bar for non beer drinkers (though why would you come to a place called World of BEER).  - Lots of TV's and games to keep you entertained and test your inebriation level.  - Well priced HH (rotating list of $4 somewhat interesting drafts, $5 beer worthy bar bites, Guinness  bathed brat FTW).  Good daily promos.  - Decent grub.  Everything designed to work with beer.  Nothing fancy.  Crispy, moist but oily, plate of beer battered fish and tater tots with an apple kale coleslaw (great with beer), a slightly dry but well flavored beer can chicken (good nuisances of the beer permeate throughout, garlic mash and pan gravy bring it all together, sweet sour onions brighten it up).   Great breaded and fried pickles (dill pickle chips, peppadews and spice warming pickled green beans whose warm vinegar goodness makes beer sing).  Finally, a giant pretzel.  What's to say, it's a big a$$ pretzel and beer's buddy!  - Fast and local service at the bar.  Only downside; unless you live in Henderson, this place is FAR, made worse by the lack of expressways and highways.  Visitors, 30 minute Uber from the Strip.  In a word, fun."}
{"text":"Had a good experience here my first time. All the food options were quite good. Yes, I reccomend fhe pretzel. It is perfect bar food, though our entrees were perfectly enjoyable as well. Nevertheless, you must come here for the drinks. Why else would you? After all, the beer list is exceptional and they have some incredible offerings sure to please most any palate. My only complaint was the slow and inconsistent service as our server was clearly overwhelmed managing a gargantuan party, amongst some additional tables, and we definitely fell by the wayside."}
{"text":"First time here tonight, there was no one to greet us when we walked in, not a huge deal. Anyway, my boyfriend and I waited and didn't know to seat ourselves or wait so I walked over to two young women (employees) talking behind the bar and had to interrupt them to ask if we should seat ourselves they said \"no go wait by the hostess stand\" there's no \"stand\" it turned out to be a barrel which is fine but it was sort of confusing since we've never been there before. I didn't think to look for a barrel to wait at especially since there was no hostess there. I thought the customer service wasn't great. No one apologized for the confusion and no one to greet us. The food wasn't that great either. The drinks were decent. I wouldn't recommend World of Beer, you're better off going to Yard House, Miller's Ale House, Red Robin, even Buffalo Wild Wings. I would never go back to WOB again, it's nothing special at all."}
{"text":"Awesome service and even better food. I had the Chimay burger and Renata creek summer kolsch. Both recommended by are. Dry friendly server. Great atmosphere and wonderful staff"}
{"text":"Yoga Pants is amazing! WOB you have to get these guys back in here again. They only take requests... They have a keyboard and drums... Fire drill. Both guys play and sing, absolutely awesome ! You guys rock loved every minute if it!"}
{"text":"Never really cared for WOB. Service wasn't the best on our last visit and I can't say it was much different on this one. My girlfriend loves their Blueberry Hefe here and it was a hot AZ day so we stopped in for one.   I remember last time I came the didn't have the best tap Selection and lacked California breweries. Well that has definitely changed! I think they had every Ballast Point selection on tap. Stone Brewing as well. Definitely not the same place I last visited. Was glad to update my review for this place!"}
{"text":"Hello and welcome to World of Beer. I was meeting a buddy of mine to catch up on life and enjoy a few beers, so I suggested we meet here since I have been wanting to try it. I arrived early and ordered a nice crisp cold beer which came in Goblet style glass. I ordered 2 beers the first was Fastback Racer, which had a citrus and rye notes. Hop forward and has some bitterness but amazingly drinkable. For an appetizer we had the tater Tots. Tater tots topped with our homemade beer cheese, jalapenos, crispy bacon, scallions & sour cream. These are really good. I like things spicy so having a chance to have a bite of jalapeno with a few tots was quite good. This is a big App so be careful not to fill up on these. I also had the dry rub chicken wings with house made blue cheese. Average wings but the home made blue cheese made up for it. They are more famous for some of their German food creations so I had minimum expectations of the wings. My friend had the schnitzel and he said it was good and flavorful. The staff was very accommodating explaining the different beers and food. The crowd was minimal for a Thursday night and atmosphere was calm and quiet. There were a few families here so don't be discouraged to bring your brood. Thank you for dining at World of Beer. I hope to go back here soon. I like all the choices of beer and I believe I saw a beer club that I would like to tackle. Some menu choices also looked inviting and would like to try a few different things. If at Galleria mall and want to get a cold frosty one and a good snack swing by and soak this joint in."}
{"text":"I think the layout isn't warm or inviting.  Yes they do have lots of beer choices, which is nice. I just don't feel it at this place."}
{"text":"AWESOME!!!!! This place can take care of the adults and the kids! JAY MAN was able to please not one but two 14 year olds, Unbelievable! That's not an easy task. Nicole is the first manager we met super sweet, hot and hooked us up with our game and my T shirt. Richard another manager is super cool! He came over welcomed us, informed us of their happy hours and rewards program that JAY had done too. Which was sooo cool! We just finished our desserts the s'mores and the pretzel pudding was the bomb!!!"}
{"text":"Good friendly service off the hop. 550 beer choices, 52 on tap Had Joseph James - local - mango weizen, very smooth and crisp. The Homemade Pretzel with beer cheese was huge and had great texture. Chipotle chicken sandwich was good, standard tots. Hot honey BBQ wings were ok. Food was decent but you're here for the beer"}
{"text":"This is my first visit here...the bartender (justin) showed me how their iPad system works to identify beers of interest to me plus made a couple amazing suggestions himself that I was very happy with based on the types of beers/hops I like. He also made a great lunch suggestion (I had the shrimp tacos & they were great)! Very friendly service & knowledgeable about the beers on tap here which is important to a beer snob like me! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Sitting here right now. This place is usually bomb, but we came here to watch the Purdue game, so we sat in front of the television with it on. We were asked to move because a larger party was coming in (okay understandable) so we've now asked four times if they can switch the TV they sat us in front of to the game we came here to see. Still nothing. Like, why am I even here then bro? We've resorted to streaming it on our phone which we could've done at home without the overpriced beer. Jussayin'.  UPDATE: still no game. Ordered an appetizer 40 min ago. Still no food. Just gonna pay for it and leave. There's only 15 min left of the game anyways. Legit paying for food we're not going to eat just to get out of here."}
{"text":"I think it will do better here at the Epicenter than it did in South End, because it has the simple bar/bar food atmosphere, without turning into the whole nightclub scene.   Overall the food was fine, nothing to rave about, and for it being a beer place, our beer order got screwed up each time (for example, one person ordered a Guinness blonde, and a pint of plain came out, and the server argued that it was a blonde, which it clearly was not). I will say the pretzel was on point, and huge, but that was probably the highlight of the entire evening. The tacos were more breading and filling than actual meat, and the wings were rather on the small side.   They do have a large selection of beers and offer flights, so it's a great way to taste some new beers, but it also isn't a spot that warrants a solo trip to the epicenter. I would have to be in the area to head here again, only because there are just better food and beer spots in the city (in my personal opinion)."}
{"text":"Great beer selection and friendly staff. On weekends the place gets rather full with local college students. But the place is overall friendly. Tables can be a bit scarce, but ask to sit with someone - more than likely they will let you and you may make a new friend.   Decent food menu and good pricing on beers and mixed drinks."}
{"text":"Good place to go if you are looking for lots of beer options. (Obviously, it is called World of Beer). Love the Sea Dog Blueberry. Download Untapped and World of Beer is even more fun!   Service can sometimes be iffy. Brunch (while a good deal) was only okay.   Their happy hour is good - try their margarita flatbread. Yum!"}
{"text":"Just popped my head in here quickly, looking to watch football.  LOTS of beer, and the place was packed but they dont serve any food!"}
{"text":"Awesome place for any beer lovers. They have a huge range of beer on tap and in bottle. They will make any beer lover satisfied."}
{"text":"World of Beers is a cute little restaurant outside of Galleria Mall I say that if you're around the area maybe you should stop in for their happy hour and try out their menu."}
{"text":"Had a few disappointing things happen. Drinks coming after 25 Minutes. The bar being very inconsistent, none of the drinks were the same. Different color and taste and they were the same drink... That was disappointing and a good way to ruin a good drink. Our waitor forgot about our food, we didn't have to pay for it in the end, but we had a very exhausting day and were starving and got the food 50 minutes after we ordered. Our waiter didn't really seem to know beer and said repeatedly  that an ale was the IPA in a flight which there is an obvious color difference. Not sure if I will return which is a shame because their beer list is amazing."}
{"text":"Wow LOTS of beers here as you might guess from their name.  Definitely a change of pace from most of the other bars on Mill Ave, THEY DONT EVEN SERVE LIQUOR!  I stopped in here on a Tuesday right after they opened and it was pretty packed."}
{"text":"World of Beer has to be one of my new top favorite places both for food and beer.   They have an awesome selection of beer on tap, including hard ciders and are awesome at helping pick out a new one for you.    But also their food is really really good.    Just writing this is making me hungry and wanting to go back.    Service was great, its a bar/pub atmosphere not a 5 star formal restaurant.  Its casual just the way it should be. As long as my food arrives hot and my beer cold, i'm good."}
{"text":"I'm serving notice upon you all- I call this bar from 11a-1pm every Saturday, so find somewhere else to drink.  They aren't overpriced (Stella was $4, craft brews were $5), and they are very good at understanding that you're here to drink beer, so unless your glass is empty you can enjoy conversation with your friends and not the staff."}
{"text":"If you are a Beer drinker like me then check out this place cause you can get good prices at Beers and even get to try some before you can order them. The live music is also a treat too."}
{"text":"I have been here twice, both times before reading the mostly not-so-positive reviews at Yelp tonight.  The first time we came in it was a weekend and the place was empty.  Uh-oh.  Should have been a clue.   The second time it was a holiday and again pretty much empty so of course our waitress was ultra-eager to make some tips.  I don't blame her.  She was overall probably the only reason I would ever return.  I chose something that sounded good to me. She was back in a few minutes with a glass that was just over half-full of beer and the rest foam. She told me that was all that was in the tap so it was on the house.  Fair enough, despite the foam I got some value out of it.  My companion also got the bad luck that the first choice was gone but they had enough for a little sampler.  We didn't want to stiff her by not ordering any real drinks so we both ordered another round. The server was prompt and attentive. The ambience was decent. She lost a point (not her fault) because she \"checked in\" with us a little too frequently but I blame that on the owners for not drawing enough customers to give her a decent income.  The clientele is a bit bizarre, not college-type, more like middle-age lechers but whatever. My companion guessed this is a one-location local place. Because I was bored I Googled it and no, it is a huge franchise operation with WOB's all over the country, sorta like McDonalds.  Kinda ho-hum 'xcept I did see a cool car I had never seen before out the window and also I bicyclist who stopped by for a quick beer that was quite nice to look at.  Should I add a star for that?"}
{"text":"The plus side to the bar is that it does probably offer every beer ever known to man. And you can keep you bottles to display as trophies. They also offer a rewards system that earns you points for trying different beers. And the iPhone app is helpful in keeping track of all the beers that you have tried and which ones you like.   Where can you go wrong with a place called World of Beer?  It's simple really.  You offer too many choices. You have a popular idea but don't allow enough room for seating. Hire unfriendly staff the are slow and not very knowledgable about beer.    Overall I might come back with my friends who love the place but this place would never be my first choice on own."}
{"text":"Lonnie and Sare were awesome! Great date night! Locals will love it!!   Back again! And Sara is still a rockstar bartender!!!"}
{"text":"Stone Brewing Arrogant Tap Appropriation during American Craft Beer Week 2013...do I really need to say more?  The selection of Stone brews at this all day event was dizzying.  I was very surprised that we were able to find some seats...but fortunately we managed, without too much hassle.  Our server was really good, very friendly and helpful.    I continue to love this place and recommend it to anyone who loves good beer and to those who could use a little help in their beer selection...it was pretty amusing, we were there for the Stone Brewing event last night and at the table next to us, this guy orders a Corona...pretty funny to watch the faces at the tables surrounding him when the server brought it out to him."}
{"text":"I've only been there once & don't plan on ever going back.  I took my nephews to Mill Ave when they were visiting, World of Beer was our first stop for a beer, we sat for about 15 minutes before anyone even acknowledged us. It was busy but it only takes a  few seconds to say \"I'll be right with you\".  So after the waitress finally walked up to our table, she was clearly not a happy camper,, she had a scowl on her face & answered my question about a beer with a shitty attitude as if it wasn't her job to help me. We sat there for another 10-15 minutes waiting for our beers & then just walked out before she brought them, It shouldn't take 30 minutes to get a beer but if the waitress was nice, I may have stayed. I wish I knew her name so I could give her a little friendly advice on good customer service.  We went across the street to the Tequila bar where the service was amazing, the staff was friendly & they have food."}
{"text":"Well we chose to try it out.  Arrived at about 8pm.  Walking up it looked promising.  Once we got inside, it went downhill quickly.  We stood inside the door for about 10 minutes without being acknowledged.  Then after we were noticed and sat a table we waited 15-20 minutes without anyone acknowledging us or taking a drink order.  My party left without eating or drinking anything.  We ended up driving 10 minutes to Yard House and are currently enjoying great service."}
{"text":"2nd visit to WOB.  Came here for lunch  and found out they only serve brunch now.  A limited lunch menu and breakfast offerings.   A little disappointing since I was looking forward to the same lunch I had on my 1st visit.   Oh well.     Service was good.  We ordered the burger with tavern tots, cheese and sour cream and green onions.     Chilaquiles was very good.  Spices were on point and food cooked well.    World of beers did not disappoint wished it had a full lunch menu on the weekends though"}
{"text":"We ordered our drink and the bartender did about 20 other things before getting our drink in an almost empty bar, they had no drafts we wanted, no bottles we wanted, and the beer we did get was warm. Horrible service and selections."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. Claim chowder salty and not hot. Ordered the kale apple salad with chicken no pecans and chicken was dry. Husbands burger was ok. The appetizer came out after lunch. The beer was good. The waiter was nice. Maybe come for a beer after shopping but otherwise not to excited."}
{"text":"Second time here since they opened and had the chipotle chicken sandwich with avocado. It was delicious! Our waiter (Jeremiah) recommended I have \"the mule of different color\" it was amazing also! Very friendly and nice! Would definitely come back at again! Side perk got to sit on some comfy seating and watch our boys in blue while we eat! #GODODGERS!"}
{"text":"Found a new watering hole!   I was surprised to see this location built in to the Galleria mall but after finally getting a chance to check it out and I'm incredible impressed.   Great beer options, the food is great and they have vegetarian options!   The staff is very friendly, the view and atmosphere is very chill and truly allows you to hang out and enjoy yourself for a few hours. Inside or outside you won't go wrong with this place. Have it a solid 5 stars.   Pricing  Atmosphere  Food   On draft"}
{"text":"Just ok. It's family friendly. Meh."}
{"text":"Loved the beer and my flatbread flat iron steak, although I ordered the salad, it was still very delicious. The giant pretzel was definitely a showstopper. Would get again! Love the outdoor seating. A little loud inside with all the football but I guess when you're in Wisconsin you need to get used to that!"}
{"text":"We hit this place after a week of trying all the local breweries. Really great selection of over 500+ beers, a lot of which are on draft. Their app (which they have on iPads at the bar) makes it much easier to find something you are interested in based on style, country, etc. The service was good and the people working there were knowledgeable about beer in general and what they had on draft. They always checked in on us and made sure our beer never got low. Extra points for having a daily 50% off beer cooler. This is a fun way to try beer you might not have while getting them at half price.   The only downside I can see to this place is the sort of gross mall location and a general corporate-type vibe inside (probably due to the mall location). We also tried the food and it was OK, not great, a tad spendy for what it was (mall location, again). Overall, stick to hitting the local breweries (Bad Beat and Lovelady arent far away) for a more chill, authentic experience, but hit WOB for overall selection (they also carry the local Vegas beers)."}
{"text":"Went here for the R&B night, good music but prices were high. Definitely won't travel from East to Middleton for over priced drinks. I'll stick to the East side. Bummer"}
{"text":"Went there yesterday for the first time after reading some great reviews , decided to order one of the beers and a burger , beer was pretty good , but highly dissapointed with the fact they just serve u a handful of fries and I do mean a very small amount , for the price I paid for that burger and fries could had gone to Red Robin and get the same quality of burger and bottomless fries, which btw they are the same style of fries, even told the server about the dissapointment of the amount of fries , all he said was oh yeah they just put a handful, that's it , not even offered to add a few more, too bad , it's just a sport bar with a bunch of beers , it ain't Gordon Ramsay!!"}
{"text":"WOB is becoming a popular name in AZ. If you and your friends wana cone on in and sample beers from around the world or you have a friend from a foreign country and want to show them a small part of home in the form of beer. Then this is the place to go.  I give this a 4 star because its a chain and predictable.  Comfortable but just the same as any other WOB."}
{"text":"I really hate writing negative reviews. Went with friends to try a new place. Beer selection was a good mix of local brews and some familiar labels. Appetizers were good (tried the pretzel and fried pickles). Dinner was terrible! I ordered the beer can chicken which was ok but nothing special. Husband has the fish and tots DISGUSTING! 3 small fish chunks over fried and dry. Frozen fish sticks are better... no tartar sauce. Expensive for gross food. We couldn't even eat part of it. Friends had the brats. Dry and no flavor. Definitely wouldn't recommend for a meal but not a bad place for a couple beers and a snack..."}
{"text":"Gonna keep it real simple.  Clean, spacious, bar seating, booths and tables. Outdoor patio as well. Dog friendly! Yes, yes and yes!!! Every time I've been here the service and help has been perfect.  No shortage of beer....55 draft taps, local brews, and the full rainbow etc.  They also have an infusion tower that puts a creative twist on your favorite beers infusing them with unique flavors.  Bottles, cans , drafts in the hundreds.  Sunday 11am-3pm bottomless booze brunch for $25.  As far as the food it's your pretty standard bar food mix up. I'd figure the beer is the main attraction and the food is the step child.  Beer, beer and more beer! Hooray for the beer!!!!!"}
{"text":"\"Why am I here?\" was the only thing I could think of while standing on the handicap ramp in a very crowded, very poorly chosen location.   I've thought about the positives: Expansive craft beer selection, relatively quick service considering the space constraints and crowd size, live music, and lots of guest brewers coming in (shout-out to Four Peaks!).   But after considering all of these positives, I was still standing on a ramp with a $7 Brewdog IPA (which is amazing) in hand questioning why in the world they would put this great of a concept in this terrible of a location.   I can't help but to think that World of Beer Inc. saw an opportunity to capitalize on the craft beer culture that has been pioneered by the likes of The Roosevelt Tavern, Four Peaks, Papago Brewing and Taste of Tops (among others), and forced their corporate concept on to Mill Ave in to whatever space they could find.   It should be noted that this Florida-based company is being run by the former management of Outback Steakhouse. At least I hope the franchisee is a local and has better bona fides than the corporate Outback crew.   If you really are in to craft beer, support your local proprietors!"}
{"text":"Went here for my friend's birthday pub crawl and we ended up staying for most of the night. Great selection on tap (and it's apparently a rotating selection, so I need to pop back in at some point to find out what else they serve), especially when compared to a lot of other places on Mill that seem to mostly have Bud Light and a couple other beers on tap. Even better selection if you're going for something in a bottle.   Really, the only downside about this place was the group of morons who kept bugging us and kept trying to drink our beer (which the bartenders replaced for free when they found out). But the bouncers were quick to give them warnings and then kick them out when they got to be too much."}
{"text":"This is the place for the beer enthusiast. We've spent a couple of long Saturday nights here watching football trying to make a dent into the 500+ beers they have in-house. We've had some of the food which didn't have us in awe, nor did it disappoint. Service can be slow, but the knowledge of beer, especially from the bartenders, will definitely impress.   This number of taps isn't as many as other places such as Yard House, but what they miss in numbers, they make up for by having taps that rotate daily and a significant number of local brews or limited releases like the 17% Dogfish Oak Aged Vanilla World Wide Stout which is one of the strongest yet most flavorful beers I've had in recent history. They keep the selection spectrum wide enough, and well organized in their app, to keep any beer drinker happy. I'm always up for trying any of their nitro brews, which they usually have three to four tapped.  Also unique to WOB is their infusion tower and cask engine which can be hit or miss depending on the flavors you're in to. Feel free to ask for a taste, you won't get any opposition. What I did see being used regularly and should be implemented in every bar with taps is the star sink, or glass rinser. That extra rinse will lead a to a cleaner glass and pour which will allow you to appreciate the flavors and aromas.  The food was what we expected and everything was made to order. On the menu, they'll have beer suggestions to pair with your food. Unless we're starving and want a separate entree for ourselves, we just usually get shareable stuff and snack throughout the night so we can focus on the beer which is what we are here for. But you can't go wrong with the obligatory nachos and pretzel.  If you're one and done or a two-pump chump as far as the number of beers you drink, the night will be affordable, but if you're in it for the long haul and come in on a Saturday like we did, bring a Grant and probably a few extra Jacksons. Our tabs for two have both been $100+ before tip on both nights. Otherwise make sure to take advantage of their happy hour 2-7 M-F and reverse happy hour Sun-Thur 9-close offering $4 drafts, $5 spirits and shareables, and $6 wines. They also have a rewards program where you'll earn with every dollar spent. I'll keep an eye on the app when they bring in the next beer I'm looking for."}
{"text":"I wish I can give this place 0. My boyfriend and I come here pretty much every Monday and Thursday after work. We lovedddd coming for happy hour and the not so many people hours. However after my last experience it was fucking disappointing. In the last visits the witness was being mean/giving us shitty service, tipped herself the tip she apparently deserved. No. We didn't say much the first time because it was weird but we didn't make nothing of it. Until the second time she tipped herself an amount she didn't deserve, due to her shitty service. When we go out we always tip cash, I've worked in the food industry and my bf family has as well to know how it's like. I find it disrespect to not give a person the tip they deserve. However this girl doesn't deserve anything. I believe she has us confused with someone else but that fact that they know we go there often and accuse of not paying the waitress a tip, is pretty ridiculous. Took her 30 mins to get us a sprite. The fact that she was being petty to us for no reason and we are loyal customer that tip in my opinion / more than some deserve/was insulting. Only good thing of this place is food but oh well ?"}
{"text":"We aren't chain restaurant people, but I love beer and they have plenty of it.  The food is also very good.  We have never had an issue with service and the food always comes out right and hot.  Be careful where eyou sit or you can get blown away by the vents!"}
{"text":"This review is coming from a guy who does not drink beer but will say this is the only place in Tempe I will have a beer or two at! I love the vast selection that is offered at World of Beer and there are quite some strong stuff. I have found that I enjoy stout beer the most and they have quite the selection on stout (both draft and bottled). If I'm going to drink beer, it will be flavorful and heavy. Staff is great and if not all, most are very informative about the selection and are always willing to give samples. I can be indecisive about what I want and the staff is great at helping me make up my mind. I recommend to anyone who enjoys beer and even to those who don't drink beer much. One of my favorite spots on Mill Ave."}
{"text":"If I could rate this ZERO stars I would.  Based SOLEY on the \"owner\" of this establishment.  I cannot imagine he doesn't have business partners. This man was so rude and unprofessional.  I've never in my life been treated like this.  We were greeted by him blocking our entrance to the outside bar area.  We were told there were no tables, when there were in fact several open seats. And how did this man not know we weren't meeting someone at one of those tables.  We asked to sit inside and put our name on the list for an outside table when one became available.  We were told it would be \"at least an hour\" we had no problem sitting inside. Spending our money.  Until a table became available. However the \"owner\" wouldn't let us sit and enjoy our happy hour in peace.  Congratulations.  You've lost four very loyal customers who spend a good amount of money here nearly every week."}
{"text":"Love this place! Must go if you're into beer! So many selections. Our server was outgoing and friendly. It's a most stop every time we come to Vegas."}
{"text":"We have been here several times for the great beer selection. However, the past three times, the service has been HORRIBLE. The bartenders are distracted and inattentive, to say the least. The support staff is awesome and tries to help the best they can, but they are at the mercy of the bartenders. And we have yet to see a bar manager who checks in to make sure things are going well...maybe there isn't one? Anyway, despite the awesome beers, we've given up. Sigh...."}
{"text":"Not really a spot I'd go to, food too salty, and the beer kinda sucked. I was open minded coming into this and had high hopes... oh well idk if I'll give it a second try."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. We drove by and saw this place and the fact that it is called World of beer was enough for us to go and check it out and i am sooo glad we did. First off, i absolutely love how big and open the windows are here. Great to sit and be able to take in the nightlife going on outside as well as what's going on inside. Lots of TV's, so its a good spot to catch a game too.   The beer menu is pretty large and im sure you will come across an old favorite and will find something new to love if you are in the mood to try some new brews. We had a few black and tans, few beer shots ( delicious). Our waitress was awesome, she was rlly attentive given how busy she was she was just so happy and i love getting service like that. Nothing worse then someone with a tear in their eye and an evil sad look on their face while serving you a beer that is supposed to make you smile.   This place would be off the chain if they served small plates to go with the beer but they do have a list of nearby places that you can order from and will deliver to you on the spot...which is a nice touch.   Ill be back for suresies."}
{"text":"Great new spot! It's nice to see some more quality bars open in the Mill Ave District. I wish they had a kitchen, but at least their selection of beers is awesome! Lots of unique beers and seasonals. I like to try a few samples before making a choice and they're ok with that! Last time I tried a Fall Cider by Woodchuck, I believe, and a yummy strawberry beer. Def go check it out. They don't have a huge seating area. There is a bar rail, some booths and \"community style\" tables that seat maybe 6 people, a vault room and a few tables upstairs. Maybe it's just that the place is somewhat narrow, but whenever I've been there- it's pretty crowded!"}
{"text":"Horrible/non existent service. Filthy table had to twist waitress arm to clean. Then she was gone. Sat for 15 min while waitress lumbered about seemingly avoiding us. They weren't even busy. 2 other people clueless and hanging behind bar.  Plenty of places where people care about patrons.  Update. World of beers....I would be happy to contact you to share details of bad experience, but I am not sure where/who to contact. Please provide name and contact info. Thanks"}
{"text":"I love the HUGE selection of beer (of course) and cocktails. I stopped in for bite and drink. We sat ourselves down. The location. Is very inviting!"}
{"text":"I went in the other night with a big group of my friends. Our server Jason was absolutely awesome and went about and beyond to make sure all 10 of us were taken care off.. Although, I found it extremely rude and unprofessional when our order was being taken, not only a fellow employee, but the manger himself came to our table to bug our server about another table. That is extremely disrespectful to continuously nudge our server in the back while we are trying to speak to him. The beer and the servers are great! But I couldn't go to a restaurant where the manger is rude and creating a hostile environment, I suggest ordering out!"}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times and finaly said enough was enough. Great selction of  beer. No food, average service and the band plays from a balcony. The male bartenders have no personality- unless your a woman under the age of 25.  Lots of places in Charlotte with good beer selections and a lot better atmosphere."}
{"text":"Good spot on Mill to try a wide variety of beers.  The servers are friendly and knowledgeable of the beers, which is important in a place like this.  It is a bit loud but they do have an upstairs area that I would recommend if you're with friends and want to have a conversation."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. My three friends ordered the fish fry which they all said was great. I ordered the 5 wings. It came on paper smothered in grease so much so the whole paper was saturated. Ok I get wings are greasy, but this was over the top. Worse yet, I got 4 flats and 1 drummy. What's with that?  Also we asked how much the bottled cider we were considering was and we were told it was $4.50 but on our bill it was $6. Not a great first experience for me.   We came in on Friday about 2 pm."}
{"text":"Super chill place to hang with friends! Staff is friendly and quick. Sometime beer can be a little colder for me, but everyone is different. Don't make my comment of chilled beer stop you from going to try WoB out! Oh, and the pretzel is TO DYE FOR!  Don't go if you're not in the mood for loud music."}
{"text":"Such a fun place with great beer selections, and recently they've added liquor as well. The drinks are delicious and the service is amazing!"}
{"text":"I've been to World of Beer a few times now and I have mixed feelings about it. Yes they have a huge selection of beer. They don't have any cheap beers so be prepared to spend. I hate that the extensive bottle menu doesn't have the prices listed. Service is generally pretty good even though it gets crowded later on Friday and Saturday nights.  The last time I went we had a weird experience where the draft beer my husband received was either not what he ordered or it had gone bad. It was a beer we had both had multiple times before so we knew what it should taste like. He told the server and she brought a different beer, but the other one still showed up on our check and the server didn't want to take it off. She ultimately did take it off but I thought it was strange that she even tried to charge us for it. Also our friend got a Fat Tire in bottle and it smelled and tasted funky. Maybe they don't sell a lot of it and that one was old, but it was weird to have two beer mishaps in one visit.   As others have mentioned they do not have food but you can bring your own or order delivery from places nearby.  They have live music most Friday and Saturday nights."}
{"text":"This is my 3rd time being at World of Beer and I have to admit, I am in love. Not only is their craft beer selection on point, their food is amazing. We continue to get amazing service from the staff and the owner Wolfgang is pretty amazing as well! Perks of World of Beer: NO GAMING, Fabulous beer selection, amazing food, wonderful service.   Oh...I forgot to add Happy Hour! Probably one of the best places in town for it."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, but a bit expensive. You're kind of out of luck if not a beer drinker, I think they only have 4 bottles of wine to choose from, and absolutely no liquor...  I was offered \"beer shots\" and finally took them up on one. $5 for three different beers in a shot glass?! Needless to say it was horrible.  And no kitchen?!? Sorry, ordering take-out from across the street is no substitute."}
{"text":"The beer selection here is great. There are plenty of options for craft beer drinking in Lakewood. World of Beer has the atmosphere of a sports bar. I prefer dark and musty old man bars. There are plenty of great hillbilly bars on Madison. Their downfall is that the drink selections cater to old hillbilly crowd. Lakewood needs a hybrid where the crowd of Deagan's can interact with the crowd of The Shamrock under one roof. The perfect place for a bar like this would be on Franklin Blvd between both Detroit and Madison. The prices at World of Beer are where they should be on most offerings. You can catch a few imperial 9% and up for around $5 which is a great value. This bar is almost identical to Beer Cellar on Euclid in University Circle."}
{"text":"Let me just say the pretzel was huge.  It's a meal by itself. You better love salt because there is a half pound of it on that pretzel.   What really surprised me was the beer. I had a local favorite called \"Kilt Lifter\" and they served it Luke warm.  The server then brought out a cold glass and poured my beer into it.  It did not help.  I can't believe a place called \"World of Beer\" can't properly serve a cold beer.  Nothing is always perfect. They get one more chance and if they blow it then they're off the list..."}
{"text":"Keep coming back! Wouldn't call myself a beer expert, but have definitely fallen victim to the sour-beer trend! Ommegang Sour has quickly become a favorite.   Sarah and Erin are on top of it! Thanks Erin for the quick professional service and Sarah for ice cold beers! This duo is a great!   Thanks girls!"}
{"text":"if you want quality craft beer and a huge selection.... this is the place to be. I always ask for tasters before ording a pint and the bartenders are always friendly enough to let me try what I want. Also, its a rotating beer menu, so there is something new to try every time I go!  I would also recommend trying their beer flights, so you can get a little taste of everything.  I like to sit outside on the patio and silently judge the drunken ASU kids that walk down Mill Ave, embarassing themselves in so many ways. Its just my form of entertainment.  They also do Trivia night which is free!  I will avoid this place like the plague during the weekends though, its small and gets crowded quite quicky, but the weekday its just perfect."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if I'm completely sold on this World of Beer location.   They are located on the corner of the 2nd floor at the EpiCenter. It's a large location with multiple tables inside. Some of the tables are awkwardly placed so you have to squeeze past people just to leave.   For some reason, every World of Beer has slow service and this one is no exception.   We got a flight that was nice, cold, and enjoyable. We also ordered the pretzel and got upsold on the beer cheese. The pretzel was delicious but the beer cheese is just not good at all to me. For my meal, I ordered the bowl Bibimbap and it was pretty good. The only downside is that I could tell it was sitting in the window for a good minute because it wasn't served hot. The flavors were spot on and the portion was perfect. My boyfriend got the beer brat and the portion was laughable. Poor thing. He said it was okay taste wise but he ended up eating some of my food to fill him up.   Overall, I would return for beer and appetizers if I was at the EpiCenter but I wouldn't go out of my way to visit."}
{"text":"Great place to go for beer enthusiasts and the adventurous alike. There are SO many choices, almost too many. They keep a selection on tap (I think it's 40-50) and the list is always changing. I'm not a huge beer drinker, but I do enjoy it occasionally. One of the great things about this place is that they will let you try a sample of something if you aren't sure. And they have beer flights which gives you the ability to try a selection if you can't make up your mind.  Price wise-it's not really too bad, I think it ranges from $4.00-$10.00 depending on what beer you get. Service is a little slow, but the place is always packed so it's to be expected.  I think the bar might be a little TOO small for the crowd it draws...especially on St. Patrick's Day when it was one of the only bars on Mill that wasn't charging a cover. You'll literally be elbowing your way to the bar..it's definitely not a place for the claustrophobic. I don't particularly like the layout of this bar. It was poorly designed.  Pros: Wide variety of beers to choose from and you can get samples.  Cons: Too small, service is slow for the most part.  I think if you're wanting to check this place out and get a proper experience, it's best to visit when it's not busy--otherwise you'll just be annoyed."}
{"text":"Horrible! Horrible! Horrible! Ordered boneless wings- greasy!, ordered cheese plate- it was decent but not great, 2 burgers- one was burnt (waitress never asked how my friend wanted it cooked) but it was ordered to be plain, no toppings, guess what! Came with lettuce and tomato. Alcoholic drinks were filled with ice, not tasty, nor worth the price. But don't bother trying to complain since the servers never come around. Ugh. Waste of $75."}
{"text":"This has to be the best beer house I've been in. I believe they have 50 beers on tap. The service was fantastic. Everyone was very friendly and attentive. We had one of their appies and it was fantastic. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Love this place. Been here 3 times. 1st time had a little bit of an issue with service, but we enjoyed the food and beer. The other times service was great, especially this last time, we had Austin. He was very friendly and always checking on us. We've had the pretzel twice because its amazing. Got to get the beer cheese. I've had the steak sandwich that was delicious as well.  Of course a great selection of beers."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Great food, great prices and the outdoor area is really cute and cozy :)"}
{"text":"This place is \"okay.\"  They do have a great selection of beers, and the place is pretty big inside.  However when I came here I had trouble finding a seat and service wasn't the greatest.  And it's expensive.  I guess it's okay for a beer or two but not a place I would stay for a long time."}
{"text":"The beer selection is good, but the bartenders are terrible. Very slow here. It wasn't even jam packed and I waited 10 min for a beer. I probably won't be back"}
{"text":"This place has become one of my favorites in town.  I mean need I say more then 500 different beers.  The service is always great.  I always sit at bar and they are all fire fly and great.  The owner is always there and always says hi and is friendly.  Food is also great.  Never had a bad meal and I've tried 75% of the food menu.  I say try it for sure you won't regret it"}
{"text":"Nice patio, lots of beer, specials on beer and food, attendant and interesting servers. What's not to like?   We had a great time."}
{"text":"World of Beer is a chain with over 50 pubs in many states.  I've been to a couple in Florida (extensive beer selection, high-efficiency kitchen)  but never one this crackin'.   The beer selection here at the Greenway Cross edition is superb.  Lots of local beers, but not just each brewery's average popular compromise - -  some real top flight expressions here, and variety.  Great selection of national brews, again, showing a full diversity in line up from individual breweries.  That is impressive,  but the physical plant here is also - - it looks like a beer shrine, with the efficiently arranged huge selection of bottled beers behind the bar, all lit up like the 4th of July,  the good selection of different glassware - - and employees who are fast and smart and sharp as tacks.  The setting is strip mall drive in/drive out,  but the exterior, from the parking lot entrance, is inviting,  and the interior with a very long L-shaped bar and the touches of brick, and the perfect mood lighting - - impressive again.  The tables in the center, taking up most of the room, seemed kind of plain,  but on a Thursday night at 5:30pm they were FULL;  they were PACKED.   That did breed a bit too much echoing noise,  and the many screens behind the bar do add a touch of sports-bar anonymity  (but that could be very nice if a big game is on).    The bartender immediately offered me samples (thanks!)  when I asked whether I should get the Triple IPA from Stone or the bourbon-barrel aged imperial stout from Hinterland (which was the bomb!), though I didn't get any food.  The people next to me, though, got the calamari,  and it looked really tempting - - small rings in a crumbly crunchy batter with nice pepper (as opposed to bright fat rings) - - not a huge value at $11 or so - - and by and large the prices at WOB are not bad / not great (the 'happy hour' is decidedly limited in the range of its generosity) - - but completely fair.   All in all,  this is a very inviting beer pub with a stunning beer selection, and many fine aspects that show how corporate-scale planning can often blend some seriously good innovations in style, design, & concept with some well streamlined efficiency.    No wonder this place is packed on a Thursday 'happy hour' even though it's 5 degrees outside."}
{"text":"My stay started off nice.  I tried to talking to a guy who stated he was the owner.  Typical \"I'm better than you\" attitude.  Let me remind you Mr. Owner,  when a patron wants to talk, go out of your way.  You did not create the W.O.B name you merely bought it.  I would not give this guy any of your money as he is non appreciative of his guests."}
{"text":"I remember going to this location on opening night when Arizona landed its first World of Beer, and there were definitely some issues back then to work out. However, nowadays, this place is one of the best craft beer spots with excellent service, a full kitchen, and a beer list that can't be beat.   World of Beer often plays host to special beer events and tappings, and the staff at this location does an amazing job of handling the influx of guests. From the tables of 15 folks with all separate checks to the potential to run out of tasting glasses, they always are quick, efficient and handle the situations with a smile. Not to mention, the staff all go to beer school and are truly knowledgeable and can and do answer any of your beer questions.   This location is a great community partner as well, giving back to the community, supporting local breweries and supporting groups like the homebrew club here in Arizona. I'm a huge fan and anytime I'm on Mill I make a point to stop in and grab a beer."}
{"text":"20 minutes at the bar before anyone spoke to me. Absolutely inexcusable. Please train your staff how to manage a bar. Many staff members passed with their eyes on the floor. #itsnotthathard.  Ok so the server came with my food but without a napkin/fork. I waited another 30 minutes and finally left because I figured wob doesn't give a f*ck. Worst dining experience in a long, long time."}
{"text":"Don't allow smoking on their patio. We're talking about a beer joint that doesn't serve food that kicks people onto the sidewalk to smoke. Isn't it enough that people can't smoke in bars? Lame - lamer than lame. If they want to stay in business, they'll learn to cater to people who drink. Also, waitress brought 7 drinks in 4 trips...with about 2 minutes in between trips."}
{"text":"I'd like to take credit for adding the World of Beer \"business\" to Yelp and I was really looking forward to coming here, but I'll tell you - the parking is the main problem here. Sure, there are some street spots. On one side of South Boulevard. And there are a few in the garage behind WoB, but that's it. Everything else nearby, you are risking getting towed and for me, that's just not worth it.  Yes, they have an amazing selection of beer here. Drafts and bottles. Prices are reasonable. No complaints on that part at all.  Live music on some nights and when I've stopped in, the bands are quite good.  But the parking, oh man. I'd recommend Taco Mac instead. Sorry, guys."}
{"text":"The service at world of beer is terrible. Not only did it take 15 minutes to get a beer (and they weren't busy), they also don't know how to pour a beer. It's one thing to pay for a beer that is $8.50 but it's another when they don't even fill your glass to the rim. This happened both times I visited WoB in Tempe.   I also left a small tip because of this bad service but the bartender didn't agree and wrote in a much larger tip. I have since tried calling world of beer to get refunded and the manager said he will refund my card. That was four days ago. I still haven't heard back from the manager and my card has not been refunded yet. I called several times and no one even answers the phone. The fact that servers/bartenders decide on their own tips, a manager who doesn't resolve issues and their over priced beers I can find elsewhere is a clear sign I will not be returning or recommending this place to anyone.   I was disappointed at first with the bad pouring of expensive beer but now that the servers decide their own tips, I will never go to WoB in Tempe again. It is extremely over priced as well. There are plenty of other places to get a good beer around town, so it's not like I can't find a good beer. Their loyalty card is also spendy. $15 just to keep track of what you drink at WoB.  1. Terrible Service 2. Bartenders write in their own tips 3. Management doesn't resolve your issue 4. They don't answer their phone 5. It's over priced 6. The loyalty card is a joke 7. It's very small 8. You can't use your loyalty card if you get the student discount  I would give this place a -5 star rating. Just terrible."}
{"text":"I just love this place!  Food is good, drinks are good, atmosphere is nice, and service has always been pretty great!  Great patio to sit outside when the weathers nice.  I bring a lot of friends and visitors here, especially when we don't want to fight the downtown/strip crowds, and everyone has liked it!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Beer is always fresh with an ever changing selection. The food is good, especially for bar food. The owner is cool. He always greets me with eye contact and a smile when I come in. The bartenders all know my name, they are personable, and they are all knowledgeable about the styles of beer they serve. They give samples before you buy if you ask."}
{"text":"World of Beer is amazing!! Jay and Andrew were a perfect team providing the service I was looking for. They completely rocked the house when I was there. Also, Devin followed behind them to make it a perfect experience. You have to try their local beers with their burgers. completely makes this place my favorite local watering hole. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Came for happy hour and Taco Tuesday, and had a good time, except for one big false advertising mistake! The signs advertised $5 margaritas, frescas, and sangria. I ordered a fresca, but was charged $12 (!) for it and was told that they \"don't do that.\" Our waitress was very nice, and told a manager about it-- but he apparently said there was nothing he could do about it. I even took a photo of the advertisement for it!  Other than that, the Mac and Cheese bites and the shrimp tacos were really good-- that drink just soured the whole experience."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here during the Tempe Festival of the Arts just to have some beers and were delightfully surprised by the food and beer selection. The Flatiron steak sandwich and tater tots were delicious and the selection of beers was definitely to my standards. The wait staff was friendly and efficient when we sat at the bar.  We will definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"Great service and a nice selection. You can try any beer before you order it. Worth a visit for sure."}
{"text":"nice atmosphere. i had a v friendly waitress. beers good. lots of choices. ate the nachos. looking forward to trying more menu items.   derp"}
{"text":"Very good selections of beer and booze With both beer flights and booze flights. The tacos we had really good. The service was slow but it was memorial day weekend. Will be back"}
{"text":"World?? Maybe a small village worth. A little acre of land of beer. NOT a world. Not only was the service horrible, the beer menu was not at all impressive. In fact, it took probably 3 or 4 tries to find something they had. I would have been fine with my go to Guinness but they didn't even have THAT! And my boyfriend trying to ask about their IPA's, it was like a bunch of  dumb blonde deer in half shirts looking into headlights! He even asked the owner/manager/seemed to maybe know a thing or two guy about his favorites and what he'd recommend and he was too busy counting money to even fake a conversation. About beer. At a BEER bar! Whatever. No thanks Tempe. Go home \"World of Beer\"-you're drunk."}
{"text":"A great place to watch sports.  There are TV's all over the place, same as what you would find at Buffalo Wild Wings.  The atmosphere, food, and BEER make for a great time.  My only complaint are the prices.  I feel like they over charge to make up for the huge beer selection."}
{"text":"Fun place and nice bar tenders but can feel a little tacky. Also the trivia is very american centric so for someone who is from overseas it can drag on."}
{"text":"My friends and I come here every Tuesday night for trivia and sit in the same booth. That being said, we've never been served by the same person twice. They have a great selection of beer and I love beer, but their service has noticeably gone down hill lately. Last week, I was there for about 15 minutes before our waiter asked if I would like something to drink. I ordered a beer and 10 minutes later he hadn't brought it. When he stopped by again, I asked about my beer and he said that his manager, who had stopped by to see if we were doing okay, told him that I said I didn't want anything. In fact, my friend had told the manager she didn't want anything. Why the manager would pass on this information or  the waiter assumed I meant to cancel my order, I don't understand. They didn't charge me for the beer, which I appreciated, but trivia was about half over before I had a drink in my hand.  The worst was last week. They have rotating beers every time I go there, and I ordered an Autumn Maple seasonal that was described on the menu as having tastes of maple syrup, vanilla, molasses, nutmeg, and cinnamon. Sounds delicious, right? It was TERRIBLE. Did not taste like any of those things, just straight up hops. I actually cringed each time I took a sip. It was listed as having 10% alcohol in it, so I thought perhaps the strength of the alcohol killed the flavor, but I couldn't even smell any maple. Everyone in my group tried it in case it was just me, and they all agreed as well that it was awful. When the waitress came back, I asked her if she was sure this was the beer I ordered. \"The Autumn Maple? Yeah, that's the only beer we have that's that color.\" We all explained how we tried it and though it was terrible. That was the world I used to describe it. She asked if I wanted something else and I said no, because I figured she would charge me for another drink since she had given me the \"right\" beer the first time. Sure enough, when the bill came, I got a $7.75 charge for it.  When I went home, I looked up reviews of the beer. As I suspected, they all said how wonderful it was, and tasted just the way as described on the menu. She definitely gave me the wrong beer. Instead of trusting a group of customers, she assumed she was correct, based on the color of the beer. Considering I've never seen the same waiter there twice, I think their management must be bad, or they just suck at training their waiters. Its a fine place to have a brew with your buds, but if you're a beer connoisseur looking for a qualified knowledgable staff, do your \"global exploring\" elsewhere."}
{"text":"I ordered a southwest burger and a goose IPA , burger was good nothing special , service was good bartender was nice."}
{"text":"Giving 3 stars because of the raw size of the beer selection and good parking.  Everything else has some serious issues.  Service is slow and they don't seem to know what they have on tap.  Music was annoying.  Seating was limited and cramped, and there was no attempt to hold people at the door when in fact there were no open seats in the place, so you had quite a few people roaming around trying to find a spot to sit or just simply stand and drink their beer.  Menu was rather limited too.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Ive been hit or miss with this place. I am a beer guy, thusly I do love the selection they have there. I do agree with some of the other reviews that the staff could be better. There are some bartenders that are very knowledgable and go the extra mile for good service. and on the same note i do see bartenders loitering at times. They do have great promo nights especially monday - wednesday (College ID, Service Industry, Loyalty nights) I usually go on these days to satisfy my beer exploratory cravings.  These nights you can fight the prices a little better. WOB could have better margins if they served food and especially liquor, they do have some liquor just basic stuff and far from a full bar. It is called World of Beer, so go expecting beer.   As for the prices, if you have been to NYC you know how bad drink prices can get, (i.e. ive paid $36 for 3 Amstels), So im not going to complain especially when im getting a wide range of beers.   The atmosphere is ok, no the most comfortable nor quiet. but it is doable for a few drinks. I find myself getting bored. TVs get old after awhile.  I would go there more often, but Allison doesn't like beer to much (she is getting better with it though lol !) This makes it hard for us to stop there on a night out or some quick drinks, because im the only one excited to go.  Ask to double check a beer they are out of. I asked for a cask beer and they said they were out. Not a big deal until I saw them pour a beer out of the cast soon afterward."}
{"text":"Stopped in for happy hour with friends.  Very busy and loud, although service was admittedly pretty good.  Overwhelming beer selection if that's important you....my favorite beer is Bud Light so I felt a little out of place here.    Not somewhere I'd go again if it were my call but will probably get dragged here in the future....and won't complain loudly."}
{"text":"Very friendly place. Excellent hang out place among friends or even meeting new people.  Gabriel, one of employees working there provided great recommendations and is extremelly knowledgeable on the drinks. Look him up if you go to this place for beers on tap."}
{"text":"You want a garden variety of beers, World of Beer has some from all over the world.  One thing you need to ask each time you order a beer is if you get the wine glass or an actual pint.  I think depending the alcohol percentage, they give you a smaller wine glass for the stronger beers.  When I asked the bartendress, she said it depends from beer to beer.  There were some beers that were stronger than 10% and they had unique flavors, and they were quite strong!    It is too bad the space utilization is not the greatest.  The patio is quite small and you don't have as much space to sit anywhere.  Be prepared to be standing around the entire night, which can be a buzz kill."}
{"text":"Had such a blast last night!!! Really good live music and EXCELLENT SERVICE!!!! I had Erin as a server and she was so attentive and amazing, every question I had she never hesitated to answer and  point me in the right way and always kept a smile on her face!! Bartenders Sarah and Pua made some pretty delicious drinks and were also super friendly and attentive, the service alone is what will keep me coming back all the time!!! The food is also delicious lol but for me it's always about the service when it comes to a bar/restaurant and this place does it right, I'm so happy this place is here to stay and also close to my house hahahahaha   Just wanted to post again about how awesome this place is!! I can't believe all the negative reviews!! You people are crazy!!! I came in last night and again I had Erin as a server and Sarah was the bartender, I love seeing these girls they never let me down and always have my back when it comes to picking out the perfect beer!! Of course had another German pretzel with the delicious beer cheese!!! Another top notch night with my favorite beer place and girls!! THANK YOU WORLD OF BEER!!!"}
{"text":"Seriously disappointed in this place. A female employee took our drink orders and we got our beers. A male employee came to take our order, we ordered nachos and a flatbread. About 10 minutes go by and the SAME server came over and asked if we were ready to order. I looked at him confused. 45 minutes go by, no one came by, no order came out. Figured he had not put in the order. We asked to pay for our two beers from the manager/owner? Bill came out to $9.75, we gave them $10. And he had the audacity to say \"wow\". Excuse me, but your employee forgot our ENTIRE order. Great customer service (insert sarcasm)."}
{"text":"World of Beer - You've upped your game quite a bit since my last visit. Your service has improved and your taps are filled with a ton of great choices. Thanks for keeping the place cleaner than I remembered and taking any negative press to heart. I'll definitely be back for more of the same!!"}
{"text":"The name says it all! I am a beer snob, I know this and live with the burden. If you cannot find a beer to drink here you simply aren't trying!  I love ordering flights to get a real nice sample. The service has always been good and the servers know their beer. We usually go pretty early in the evening to avoid the rush."}
{"text":"World of Beer is actually pretty great! They have a huge selection of beers, and a pretty tasty lookin' menu. You definitely won't leave disappointed (about the food).  We first arrived around 2:30pm to check out the menu. They were going to seat us and we decided we wanted to sit at the bar top. We were greeted by a lady who seemed like she didn't care about us and towards the middle of it we realized her shift was actually ending, so it made sense... (would have been five stars if not for her kind of awkward service). I get that you're about to leave but you should still act like you care as that affects our mood. Another guy comes and takes our beer and food orders. He takes a pretty long time to check on us after we receive our food, however another girl with tattoos made up for his lack of attention, but it's okay cause we're not that needy, just is nice to be asked how is everything tasting etc...  Calamari- 2.5/5 overly breaded so it hides the taste of the seafood itself Wings- 4/5 buffalo & spicy Korean sauces were pretty tasty, served with ranch or bleu cheese and celery Beerunch Burger- 5/5 beef patty, bacon, arugula, tomato, cheese, and egg on a brioche bun, served with tater tots.... SO good and tasty  Classic Cheeseburger- 4/5 beef patty, lettuce, tomato, pepper jack cheese, served w/steak fries  Ace Pineapple Cider- 5/5 suuuuper delicious, your true cider type of beer Bad Beat Bluffing Isn't Weisse- 5/5 \"it was bomb and tasted really good\" according to my bf, LOL.  The service needs some work, but thank goodness the food and venue makes up for it. Multiple tvs, booths, tables, high tops, bar seating, and patio seating. We wanna come back for the $23 bottomless booze brunch special- all you can drink beermosas, mimosas, or bloody marys paired with a breakfast item."}
{"text":"Even though this place is a chain it still has a pretty good vibe to it. I popped in here one afternoon when they first opened but I was with my Mom and we were looking for somewhere to eat a late lunch and at that time they didn't offer any food. Now I see that they do have some appetizers and small plates available even though I haven't tried them yet. It looks to be mostly greasy bar food but hey, that's what you want to soak up the alcohol after a night out drinking. My most recent visit here was for a friend's 40th birthday. A bunch of us walked over after a nice dinner at Caffe Boa and even though we raised the average age in the place substantially we all had a great time. I only had one beer since I had already had a little too much wine with dinner. But their beer list is so impressive, I could definitely see this being a great place to hang out and try some new craft brews. They also had all the local favorites on tap, including some of the Northern AZ and Tucson breweries. The service was great even though it was a Saturday night and the place was packed. I don't particularly enjoy doing the Mill Ave scene since I am a UA alumna but I have to admit I am a fan of WOB."}
{"text":"After multiple visits over the past few months this last weekend was our last visit for awhile.  We stopped in on a Wednesday evening and found an open high-top table and waited nearly 15 minutes before even being offered water.  The acoustics in here are awful and we couldn't barely hear each other talking!  My husband was served the wrong beer (which can happen) but the replacement was served with over 1/3 foam/head!  Knowing it would take awhile to get a new one we just drank our beers and left.  We even joined the loyalty club when they first opened but unfortunately are not inclined to visit much due to the slow inattentive service, slightly high prices, and extremely awful acoustics.  Food is decent, the pretzel is a must!"}
{"text":"I FINALLY made it out to WOB this past Saturday and I will have to say I'll definitely be back.  I have been known to be a beer snob, but I am also the kind of guy who enjoys some High Life by the pool, se la vie.  Variety is important and they have a very varied beer selection. No liquor, no food, just beer.  There are some people out in Yelplandia who may be off put by a bar which only serves craft beers.  Let me assure you that the intoxication you get from drinking quality beers is a much more relaxing experience than the \"shot, shot, shot, shot, shot, shot --everybody\" style drinking experience found at other nightlife arenas.  The vibe here was excellent.  The staff was friendly, funny, helpful, and genuinely wants you to enjoy every beer selection you make.  Not certain on a beer, just ask for a sample, but you may not have to, they usually proactively offer one.  The other patrons were friendly, relaxed, and casual.  If I lived closer I'd be here all the time.  HINT: Try a beer shot, I don't know what I drank but it was beer, it was sweet, and it did the job.   Important point:  I am only docking it 1 star because I have only been there once, and will upgrade/downgrade my rating as appropriate."}
{"text":"When you can't even get good service at the bar imagine how sitting in the dining room might have been. Actually the male bartender was so rude to a customer not sure I would ever go back!!! Good luck if you decide to try it....."}
{"text":"Tons of selection, a little pricey and can order delivery from any of the restaurants located around the bar.  It's the service that is lacking here. There is usually only one bartender working with what look like bar backs sitting at the bar every time I have been in there.  I understand wanting a beer after work as much as anyone but I would serve the paying customers before the employees every time."}
{"text":"Went there tonight bartender Abby suggested a beer she thought I would like and it was amazing"}
{"text":"This is a perfect spot in Henderson for a relaxed classy bar! Big beautiful outdoor patio and delicious light food. Even kid friendly!"}
{"text":"I had been anxiously following updates for WOB on Twitter and Facebook for the past month and was eager to try this place out. It's located in Southend next to the Bland St light rail station. We walked from uptown, a little over a mile.  There is some limited parking in the Circle garage I saw.    I had read that there was no kitchen so a friend and I brought food in from Jimmie Johns which felt odd but the door guy assured us that it was perfectly fine.   Inside is quite spacious and feels similar to other beer joints such as Taco Mac, Flying Saucer, and Carolina Ale House. The patio is decent sized but narrow.  Overall it's a good layout but does not really stick out.  There is a space for a live bands upstairs.   They were slammed for the opening so it was hard to judge service but the servers and bartenders were happy to provide recommendations.  Draughts were reasonably priced at $5 - $6 for most brews. Bottles varied, I was surprised to find two of my bottles/cans were $7 including a 21st Amendment IPA which seemed pricey.   I see myself coming when I'm craving some rare beers but since I live uptown Carolina Ale House has a similar draught selection and a kitchen that is open until 2AM that may be my first choice.  I would try WOB again certainly."}
{"text":"Second time visiting World of Beers and it did not disappoint! The Wolf Burger is a must have,my husband devoured it efficiently. I am a big fan of the beer can chicken!  Our server Jason, is attentive and very informative! He is the bomb dot com!"}
{"text":"I come here often and have an amazing experience every time. The food is AMAZING and the staff is wonderful. With beers from all over the world, I never get bored with drink choices. Highly recommend coming here for both food and drinks. The atmosphere is great as well."}
{"text":"WOW! WOW! WOW! This place is the bomb!!! Beer, food & staff are excellent. Especially JAY! JAY'S the man!!! He guided us through the menu and everything he recommended was excellent. Great place to watch football too. You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"I'm not exactly one to hang out on Mill Avenue.  I graduated from college far too long ago... and most of the places I went to are long since gone (so much for nostalgia).    I went to World of Beer with my best friend in the entire universe... Brian B, my YFF (that's the Yelp version of BFF, in case you didn't pick up on it) Eric R and a guy who has put up with me for far too long who shall remain nameless (but knows who he is).   We were already a couple drinks in when we arrived, so I only had one beer here. Still, it was a very good recommendation from our server.  I told her what I wanted (ultra hoppy, non floral IPA) and she gave me two options and tastes of both.  I actually ended up liking one I didn't think I would.  5 stars for service, price and atmosphere.  Sorry, World of Beer, but you get a one star deduction for not having any food. Nothing.  Nada.  No stale pretzels.  No chips.  Granted, they allow you to get food from elsewhere... but this just does not work for me!  If you want customers to spend more on alcohol, give them something to soak it up with!  Brian and I ended up at Five Guys (bad idea, but it was walking distance).  We would have stayed at World of Beer longer, but who can drink all day without eating?  Oh yeah, Sun Devil students.  :)  *World of Beer contacted me and said that food may be on its way!  Apparently the original franchise did not allow for any food to be served on premises, but that might be changing.  I will update my review once the food situation changes."}
{"text":"It's better now that it's been here a while.once the Manager gets to know you he says hello and talks to you.took a while. The staff new or have been there a while have always been great.  Great selection of beer. Only thing taking away from a higher great is the food which is average bar food."}
{"text":"Love the idea of the board games! Great atmpsphere...our server Andrew M. was GREAT. Always on top of refills, requests, he knew the menu. I am a restaurant manager, used to be server back in the day so I can appreciate good sercive when I recieve it! Overall great experience. I was there on business and found out there are two in the Chicagoland area! How have I never heard?!  Thanks again Andrew M.!"}
