{"text":"I called in an order for a large pizza, but after picking it up, I was surprised at its size and taste. It  was more of a medium-sized pie that a large one. Although I was told that it would be six slices, I expected a larger pizza. I also had to use the ATM because they did not accept cards - fair enough. When I brought the pie home, the crust was chewy and didn't have that brick oven feel like I had hoped. It almost tasted as if the dough was not freshly made. The flavors were not that exciting either. It tasted pretty bland and mediocre. I ordered the pizza for my niece, nephew and me. None of us finished our first slice and I ended up throwing the rest away.   I do want to mention that the people who work there are very friendly and the service was very good. However, since I did not enjoy the pizza, I will not return."}
{"text":"this place is a amazing little mom and pop family ran shop. Their food is all literally baked in a wood fire oven and tastes delicious.   They also have some tradional deli selections too.  Sometimes timing can run a bit long be prepared for this but make the commitment their pizza is excellent.  The margarita pizza is delicious ask for extra basil and tomato you won't regret it.   They don't really have much of a dine in option but there are some tables.  Great service delicious food"}
{"text":"Great pizza, great price, take-out only. Nothing fancy, just great execution of straightforward, no frills, no gimmicks pizza. They have other stuff - it looks good - but I always end up deciding on the pizza. Why mess with success?"}
{"text":"Pizza is great. We love the margarita pizza. There Italian hoagies are really good. And Italian ice is so good I love the honeydew."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza, the best crust, great customer service and very reasonable price....what more do you want?"}
{"text":"This place is hands-down the best place to get pizza in Penn Hills. They offer whole wheat crust and the owner cooks every pizza so it will be delicious every time! I highly recommend trying this pizza or hoagies. They are closed on Sunday and Monday."}
{"text":"This place looks small and you may miss it driving past but trust me- stop there and get a pizza. Some of the best pizza I've had in Pittsburgh. Real wood fired pizza and for an extremely reasonable price. I will most definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"One of the best, if not the best pizzeria in Pittsburgh. Very clean store which smells amazing, friendly service, and fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"The only place we will order pizza from. The tomato sauce and fresh ingredients are perfectly baked in the wood fired oven. Delicious."}
{"text":"Great pizza! friendly family owned. Hogies are awesome with there own special sauce. I'm a regular now!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place in Penn Hills. They also have amazing bread, hoagies and side dishes. The chef is the real deal. The place is tiny, you must have cash. Reasonable wait time."}
{"text":"A take out restaurant that is cash only. Really unimpressive looking exterior. But the food is awesome and the prices are great. Wow had their Italian hoagie special last week. The bread was amazing. Just had a pizza bianco and it was really great. I was going to post a picture be we started into it too quick. My wife thinks it's the best pizza she ever had. Will be back there next week again for more."}
{"text":"Asked for a detailed receipt (was picking up an order for the office). The husband and wife behind the counter acted as though they had never heard of such an outlandish request. \"I don't even know what I'd write it on!\" was a response I received, with the check pad and a pen sitting directly in front of her. Grant you, this was an order of just two hoagies, I wasn't asking for a transcription of the Gettysburg address. My job employs several people, and we are looking for a great place to order lunch daily. Unfortunately, this place doesn't seem like it could handle a large order (large order being more than one hoagie, apparently). Would not recommend."}
{"text":"The pizza was extremely tasty; the sauce was flavorful. They use fresh ingredients. And the staff is awesome, friendly and made great suggestions."}
{"text":"Wood. Fired. Pizza.   Just those three words together make my mouth water!    Frankstown Wood Fired Pizza is a very small take-out pizza place located in between Plum and Penn Hills.  It's a very small white building next to an auto parts store.    We've ordered pizza's here before and found that it's best to order by phone and pick up since this place is always busy.  Also, this store doesn't have anywhere to sit!    Pizza's are 12\" (6 slices) with the best price in town --  $7 plus $1 for toppings -- coming out of a wood fired oven with a little bit of smoked flavor and char.  Toppings are fresh with an ample amount of melted cheese -- doesn't that just make your mouth water?    I'd give this pizza place another star if there were seating for eat-in, a restroom for customers, and an atmosphere to match.    The store also offers stuffed peppers, hoagies, Italian Ice and deli selections.   Call (412) 793-7775 to place your order for pickup!"}
{"text":"This was the third time I ordered from here.  My favorite type of pizza is the pizza Bianco. It was excellent. The pizza with a great blend of feta and mozzarella cheeses, fresh tomato and spinach.    This is my first time ordering the meatball hoagie and I am very impressed. The bread is fresh and doesn't fall apart when you eat while the sauce is sweet and the meatball is seasoned well and smooth. No weird textures everything is just as you would want it to be in a meatball hoagie. The hoagie is toasted nicely as well too.  If anyone is looking for a new place for takeout I would definitely recommend here."}
{"text":"I just discovered this place, and will be sure to return! They have a basic menus, but their food is far from it! I got the Marinara and Bianca pizzas, and they were delicious. As you walk inside, you're greeted by smiles, then you see a huge cooler with all sorts of Mediterranean  items (olives, pasta salad, vegetables, etc). Next time I'll be sure to give those a try!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza from a cozy little shop.  I got the pizza margherita with olives and pepperoni and my wife got the pizza bianco with olives and sausage.  Dough is just the right blend of chewy with a crispy crusty edge.  Tomato sauce is fresh and cheese is very good as well.  Good toppings.  I live 10 minutes away and I will be going back many more times.  Looking to trying more of the salads, the hoagies, and loaves of fresh made Italian bread!"}
{"text":"This by far is the best pizza in the Penn Hills area. Cooked to perfection using fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Ordered a few times from here, the meatball and sausage hoagie. They were both great. They arent skimpy on the main ingredient. I will be trying the pizza next! Its take out and cash only. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this pizza - I honestly am not even that big on Pizza in general, but something about this keeps me wanting it. It's not greasy, it's fresh, its crispy, its amazing. I tell everyone about it because it's the best pizza I've ever had in my life."}
{"text":"I started coming here last year when I was commuting back and forth to Pgh to take care of my mother. I love good wood fired pizza and this place doesn't disappoint. Whole wheat crust is a big plus for me. Fresh toppings. Get it to go and enjoy."}
{"text":"I travel 20 miles for his bread,hoagies and pizza.This place is as good as it gets and very friendly"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places! I love the white pizza the most with their homemade sausage.  They are never stingy with their basil or any of their toppings.  I have clients that drive from all over to get this now since I send them from my business across the street.  The place is as tiny as can be. He built that brick oven by hand! A true labor of love. Their lasagna, mmmmmm. Pick up your pizza or hoagies and get a few items from the deli case for your lunch for the week and you are covered. All their food is made with a little love too!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place food is fantastic as well as the price!! Never a bad meal always perfect!"}
{"text":"Not just premium pizza, premium wood fired pizza.  That blazing hot oven makes all the difference.  Each style of pizza is worth trying and you will find it difficult to pick a favorite, which will make you come back over and over again.  The hoagies are the best around as well and the lasagna is perfecto, just heat it up in the oven if you don't have them heat it up.  They also have a wide variety of antipasto if you are in to that.  Oh yeah, btw, you will eat the whole pizza."}
