{"text":"Amazing Gyros....and Chicken...and Beef!  The food here is SO GOOD!  Grass fed Chicken and Beef brought me in, but the awesome cashier has me returning.  It's all GRK was literally all greek to me n by asking me what my favourite foods are, Chrissy helped me make an amazing choice. also, she was the most hilarious and personable individual I've dealt with in Quick Serve Restaurants.  Food - 8.75/10 Staff - 11/10"}
{"text":"Got the Beefteki piota (some medium sized dish). It was good. Lots of food, well spiced meat, soft, moist baked potatoes, tasty coleslaw. Beef was dry though and yet still tasted good. If it was done right, it would have been amazing. I'd go back!"}
{"text":"I come from 3 generations of restaurant owners. My parents owned a Mr.Greeks and I spent a good time of my teen years working there, getting to know the cuisine and the front and back of operations.  I am a huge fan of Its All Grk, first time I had gone to their flagship on queen, I was shocked at how detailed and amazing their food was. I reccomended a ton of people and I always heard positive things in return.  Now as a big fan of this location, I am equally your biggest critic.  When restaurants start to franchise there is always a concern surrounding quality. Will they keep fresh ingredients? Will all their locations be consistent?  Yesterday I went into the location on Dundas and was confused as to what I ate. This wasn't the same chicken dinner I had on queen?!?! Why is the rice different? Why is it over cooked and not drained properly? How come the chicken isn't as marinated as the one on queen? Nothing tasted the same.  This is a prime example of what franchising does tp your business, it displaces priorities, like consistent food and places its emphasis on revenue.  You guys should work harder at keeping all your kitchens the same. Hire better cooks at your other location, you have the potential to do very well, and I am sure you are already, but your food will catch up!  Thank you for bringing amazing tasting Greek food to the GTA! Just wish quality control was more of a thing."}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place. Went in twice and suffered buyer's remorse twice. Both times I spent over $20 for one meal (incl tax and tip). Both times I found the food to be extremely bland and dry or way over simplified. I understand it's practically organic meat but for the price and considering the taste it's totally not worth it for me. I had the chicken souvlaki dinner and chicken village salad with potatoes."}
{"text":"Date with the Grk ...don't walk for week... Because you will be so full!   not because of other things lol I had the chicken platter.  Chicken was moist and tender and loads of fries.  A bit on the pricier side for lunch, but soo good!  Tzatziki compliments the chicken very nicely.  Get the platter, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My boyfriend went and had beef teki piato with coleslaw and fries, within an hour he felt so sick and pukey. Food wasn't the greatest but he was sick the whole night. With no energy and wanting to puke but can't. He finally forced himself to puke later in the night and felt and look way better. His other two friends had chicken and one of them also felt sick after too. This place must be not cooking their food properly or serving dirty food. I would not recommend this place if you have even a slightly weak stomach."}
{"text":"I was really happy to see this place pop up on Dundas in a spot that has housed so very many failed businesses, It's all GRK  did it right with great food and a very nice and inviting store front with friendly staff. The food was very good, i had the chicken Gyro with fries and it was quite delicious, the chicken was tasty and plentiful, the pita was fresh and the toppings were perfect. What I really enjoyed were the fries, they were really delicious, fresh cut and double fried to a really almost perfect crispness, I hope they stay consistent because I will be back over and over as long as they are :)  Chicken Gyro on a pita + Fries = $12"}
{"text":"I was really craving an authentic gyro and was very disappointed that they only had chicken or pork on their menu. My idea of a gyro is the beef/lamb slab of stuff that is sliced off. The chicken and pork weren't that bad but not what I went in there looking for. Also, I HATE the way they wrap them.  I got mine to go and the flimsy way they \"wrap\" the bottom and leave the top all open just doesn't cut it."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Food is bland and just not worth the price from any standpoint.  Location is good. Small space though and not many seats. Nice decor."}
{"text":"Had the chicken dinner and it was delicious. The chicken was crispy, the potatoes - amazing, rice - great, tzatziki was delicious. The dinner portion is enough to feed two to 3 people. The servers were very friendly and seemed passionate about their jobs.   Tip: Get the peach pop - it was crazy delicious. Similar to Tim Horton's peach juice in the 90s (but carbonated).   Gets 4 stars instead of 5 only because there is no room to sit down inside and I don't want to eat with people walking by watching me."}
{"text":"Had the chicken souvlaki pita here, it was good! Meat a bit dry to be honest, but all the tzatziki made up for it. They put seasoned fries right on the sandwich too which was a surprise that I wouldn't say no to.   Will try again!"}
{"text":"I frequent the taste of Danforth almost every year, I've eaten in Greektown and I've also been to Greece and I must say that I'm still super impressed at Grk for making the best gyro wrap that I've ever tasted! This is a grab and go place but the wraps are just overflowing with stuff that taking a stool seat really allowed me to enjoy myself devouring the gyro wrap.   What makes this place so yummy is that there is everything in the wrap including the fries, which although it's probably not authentic, super delicious and crunchy. The best part of the wrap though is the generous dollop of Greek yogurt! It makes the wrap refreshing and it contrasts nicely with the warm meat and wrap. Oh, just thinking about it makes my mouth water!"}
{"text":"These are the most delicious gyros! Traditional-shmaditional. I don't care. I love the fries they jam in there and these are just soooo freakin' tasty. Also cute atmosphere to hang out in for fast food. I love the open windows at Church and Dundas! The Queen street one is pretty cute too.   Ok, time to eat. Nom noms"}
{"text":"The lady took forever to make a souvlaki in a pita and I watched in disgust as she poked through my sandwich with her BARE hands to remove the fries and HAIR that ended up in it. She then turned around, wrapped it and handed it to me. Open kitchen fail!!"}
